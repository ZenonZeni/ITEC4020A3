<STRONG>Building Your Financial Foundation</STRONG>
<P>



Moving out of your parents' house and having a go of it on your own can be a shock
to the system.  After
decades of living in the comfort of family, you're suddenly faced with the harsh
realities of life - bills,
bills, bills.  How does one deal with these new-found responsibilities? You can
start by building a
sound financial foundation.  Acting discerningly on these matters could make the
difference between
making it on your own, or moving back with the folks.  Choose wisely...
<P>
<STRONG>Banking</STRONG> - Shop around.  You shouldn't necessarily stick with your
current bank
just because you've
been with them a long time.  You may want to open both a savings account for
earning interest, and a
checking account for paying the bills.  It's important to compare interest rates,
but you also should be
wary of charges for services. 
Some banks allow you to "link" your accounts to reduce fees.  Many local newspapers
run a "scorecard"
of bank rates, which can be helpful.  Although deposits up to $100,000 are
federally insured, you'll still
want to choose a financially strong institution.  If possible, have your employer
"direct deposit" your
paychecks into your bank.  
<P>
<STRONG>Health Insurance</STRONG> - With medical costs spiraling upward, having
sufficient
health insurance is a
necessity.  If you're job hunting, you should take a serious look at the medical
benefits offered by
prospective employers.  If you're fortunate, your employer will offer a group
health plan.  If not, it's
essential to obtain some type of individual health insurance.
<P>
<UL>  
<LI>Major Medical Plans typically offer a fee-for-coverage arrangement for a range
of services including
physicians' costs, medical tests, hospital fees, etc.  With some plans, you may go
to a doctor of your
own choice and your insurer reimburses you a predetermined percentage of cost. 
Most plans have
deductibles, which is the amount of money you must pay out-of-pocket before the
insurer begins paying
the expenses.  
<LI>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) have become a popular option because of
their
minimal out-of-pocket cost.  Generally, members must visit only doctors affiliated
with the HMO;
however your co-payment could be as low as $5-$10 per visit.
When evaluating different plans it's important to consider what services are
covered, and the
co-payments and deductibles that are involved.
</UL>
<P>  
<STRONG>Life Insurance</STRONG> - If you think it's just for "older people," think
again.  If you have
student loans from your
college days, you may want to consider having some life insurance to cover them,
and then some.  It's
probably a good idea to purchase a policy now, because generally the younger you
are, the lower the
premium.  Two of the basic types of life insurance are whole life and term life. 
Whole life is permanent
insurance - it's yours for as long as you continue to pay the premiums.  The
premiums are fixed and
the policy cannot be canceled by the insurer.  Over the long-term, the policy
builds "cash value" that can
be tapped into for financial needs.  Term insurance provides inexpensive coverage
over a
pre-determined period of time - 5 years, 10 years, etc.  It is pure protection and
does not build cash
value.  One type is not necessarily "better" than the other, but you may find that
a mixture of the two may
best suit your needs.
<P>
<STRONG>Building Credit</STRONG> - If you plan on buying a home, starting a
business, or doing
anything in the future that
requires borrowed money, you'll definitely want to start building a credit history
now.  Getting a credit
card and paying it off faithfully is a good way to start.  Many banks and
organizations offer VISA and
Mastercard with lots of bells and whistles attached - product discounts, airline
mileage, etc. - but
don't overlook the basics.  
<P>
You'll want to find a deal that offers worldwide acceptance, no annual fee, and a
low interest rate.  If you
don't have any credit history or if it's poor, there's still an alternative.  Some
banks offer a "secured
credit card," which is an arrangement where you deposit funds in an account that
are then used as your
credit limit.  Of course, the key to building good credit is to spend within your
means.  
<P>
<STRONG>Looking to The Long-Term</STRONG> - Building a financial foundation
means
planning for the long haul. 
If your employer offers a 401(k) or similar plan you'll certainly want to take
advantage of this convenient,
tax-deferred retirement plan.  IRAs, CDs, annuities and mutual funds are options to
consider to help
build your nest egg.  The key to realizing your financial dreams is starting now
while you have a long
time horizon.  <P>
