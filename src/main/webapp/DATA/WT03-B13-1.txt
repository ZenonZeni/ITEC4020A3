LARGE AND SMALL SMR OPERATORS JOIN HANDS...
  ...And Other Possible Headlines To Watch for in 1996

     The headline above is not as unlikely as it may seem, according
to Bob Foosaner, senior vice president-government affairs, Nextel
Communications Inc..  True, small and large specialized mobile radio
(SMR) operators seemed irreconcilable in 1995, as they clashed over
how the FCC should change the regulatory landscape at 800 MHz (LMRN,
Dec. 22).
     But SMRs big and small should be able to see eye to eye on many
regulatory issues that the commission will address this year, Foosaner
said.  
     "We [in] the SMR industry are going to become common carriers on
Aug. 10, 1996," said Foosaner.  "And there are eight to 10 outstanding
rulemakings that can ... either allow us to move our businesses
forward or adversely impact our businesses.  We should have common
interests in these proceedings, which may hurt the law firms, but
would help the industry."  
     It is in the interest of all SMRs, for example, to get an
exemption from the requirement of having to offer enhanced "911"
service (LMRN, Oct. 13). 
     Among the other questions the commission has yet to decide:  
     *  Should all CMRS providers be required to resell airtime, as
cellular companies must do today (LMRN, Sept. 29)?
     *  How should local exchange carriers and CMRS providers be
compensated for terminating one another's calls (LMRN, Dec. 22)?
     *  Should CMRS providers be required to provide interconnections
to one another (LMRN, Sept. 29)?                                      

  ...SMR Operators Drop Interconnect Service

     Depending on the rules the FCC imposes on CMRS providers, some
SMR operators may find it too onerous to offer interconnect service,
said Alan Shark, president and CEO of the American Mobile
Telecommunications Association (AMTA).  Shark pointed to the possible
requirement that CMRS providers may have to offer enhanced 911
services--as well as pay fees to help subsidize telephone service in
underserved areas.  In addition, they may have to modify their
networks to allow for wiretapping by the FBI, he said.
     "If you're interconnected, you may find that there are certain
responsibi-lities that come with that ... that may not be worth it."
     Another story still unfolding, Shark said, is how the commission
will define CMRS providers.  Such providers will be subject to certain
common carrier rules, unlike private mobile radio service providers,
which will be exempt.

  ...Commission Begins Licensing New Narrowband Channels

     This story is about the hope of private land mobile radio (PLMR)
users below 512 MHz, who face an ongoing freeze on new narrowband
channels created by the commission's June refarming decision (LMRN,
June 16).
     "We're waiting for the development of technical standards," said
Fred Day, executive director, government relations of the Industrial
Telecommunications Association (ITA).  Such standards, under
development by the Telecommunications Industry Association (Working
Group 8.8), should be available before March 1.  The standards are one
of three requirements for a successful refarming effort, according to
the Land Mobile Communications Council, a confederation of frequency
coordinators and other associations, including ITA.  
     The second requirement is that the FCC protect low-power offset
systems at 450-470 MHz from full-power systems.  The third is that the
FCC establish deadlines for the transition to more efficient
technologies.

  ...FCC Allocates New Spectrum for Public Safety

     The work of the Public Safety Wireless Advisory Committee
promises to be the major story for public safety radio users this
year, according to Bob Gurss, legal counsel, Association of Public-
Safety Communications Officials-International Inc.  The committee, a
joint venture of the FCC and the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, is charged with determining the spectrum
requirements of public safety users through the year 2010.  
     "We feel that it is important that the FCC take some action in
the very near term before all the spectrum gets auctioned off," said
Gurss.  "That's our biggest concern."   The committee plans to issue a
final report by September.  Gurss said the FCC may adopt a rulemaking
proposal allocating new public safety spectrum and then fold in the
report as comments on the rulemaking.
     Another headline to watch for, "FCC Creates New Public Safety
Division."  Wireless Telecommunications Bureau Chief Michelle Farquhar
mentioned this possibility in a speech last month.

  ...Strong Partnerships Separate Winners and Losers in Paging

     It is not enough to be able to sell one-way pagers on your own
anymore, said Scott Baradell, director, corporate communications,
Paging Network Inc.. New services that carriers are offering to break
out of the pack require that they invest in alliances to succeed, he
said.  Voice paging, two-way paging, wireless e-mail:  all require
strong support from software and hardware developers, such as
manufacturers of personal organizers.  Carriers also will need to find
resellers with the expertise to market these products.

MOTOROLA SYSTEM OUTAGE LEADS TO STORM OF BAD PUBLICITY
Vendor Tried To Warn Portland of Potential Problem

     A failure by a 3-year-old public safety radio system promoted as
a showcase by Motorola Inc. whipped up resentment last month in
Portland, Ore., and generated press that is every publicist's
nightmare.
     Motorola had tried to warn the city:  Two months before the
outage, it sent a bulletin explaining how to reset the SmartZone
manager of the 800 MHz trunked system to prevent overloading.  But
Dennis Quail, communications services division director, said his
staff has no record of receiving it.  
     He added, "My question is, why wasn't [this parameter] set by
Motorola to start with? ... And if Motorola was aware of [the problem]
and they've got engineers locally in town, why didn't they come over
and make sure it was set [properly]?"
     LMRN was unable to contact Motorola executives in time to comment
on this article.  
     But one of Motorola's largest customers said that public safety
agencies must take a measure of responsibility for system failures.  
     "I would be less critical of the vendor [than Portland is]," said
David Held, deputy director-communications division of the Michigan
State Police.  "[That's] because a vendor, we must remember, is in
business to make money. ... A lot of people put their complete trust
in them and figure they'll do everything for them, not thinking what
their motives are."
     Quail responded:  "It's interesting that he might say that.  We
received the system from Motorola. ...
[The setting] was something that was supposed to have been in place. 
It's [wrong] that the customer had to find out about it the hard way."
     Regardless of who was responsible for the five-hour outage on
Dec. 12, city public safety officials put Motorola on the grill,
speaking out through the city's daily newspaper, The Oregonian.  
     "Here we have this multimillion-dollar system that allows us to
talk to everyone but the Lord himself, and when we need it most, it's
gone," Sgt. Bob Baxter of the Portland Police Bureau was quoted saying
in the Dec. 20 article.  Oregonian reporters were not able to get a
detailed response from Motorola.
     The Oregonian's editorial page took its own shot:  "Portland
ought to be the most cantankerous customer in the country until
Illinois-based Motorola delivers on the city's $8.5 million investment
in an emergency radio system that failed for 5-1/2 hours during last
week's big windstorm."                                                

  ...Director Calls Motorola Responsive

     But in an interview this week, David Kish, Portland general
services director, said that "to be fair, [Motorola] has worked very
hard in the past couple of weeks to fix the problem."  He said that
Motorola has sent roughly a dozen top corporate and engineering staff
to investigate the failure, and has placed an engineer on call.  
     Kish said Motorola believes it has fixed the problem (see side
bar, page 2); later this month, the company plans to test the system
to make sure.  
     Motorola also plans to upgrade the system's software, which
should eliminate some "mysterious events" that occurred last summer. 
One of these caused a "minor outage," Kish said.  "We've had minor
problems from time to time, but Motorola has been reasonably
responsive," Kish said.  
     "In any new system like this, you go though a period where you
have bugs."  But, he added, "This was the first big test of the
system, and it didn't do what it was supposed to do.  It was the first
citywide emergency that would create this kind of traffic."  The city
plans to run a disaster drill in February to try to rebuild confidence
among users.
     Kish confirmed that the city is withholding $500,000 of the $8.5
million system until the city is happy with the system.  The city also
has suspended visits by prospective customers; more than 100 agencies
from China, Japan, Spain, New York City and elsewhere have seen the
Portland system.  

  ...Should Portland Have Taken More Responsibility?

     Portland and Motorola collaborated on system design and
construction, and the city handles ongoing maintenance, according to
Quail.  He said the city devotes six full-time technicians to the 800
MHz trunked radio system.
     Michigan State Police's Held, also a Motorola customer, was
unaware of how much expertise Portland devotes to the system.  But he
believes that at least some agencies do "fail to have a resident
electrical engineer ... to design and look out for their own needs or
to hire a consultant."
     When LMRN described Portland's outage, Held said, "I would not be
too critical of Motorola in the scenario you described. ... It's
pretty standard in the industry, for example, that you don't mix data
and voice on the same channel.  I would say that that's more the
responsibility of the customer."  Quail responded that there was no
way for the city to have realized that the control channel was set for
both voice and data.  "My thinking is, if [Motorola] knew that, why
didn't they come over here, as we still have not accepted the system. 
And until we believe everything is performing properly, we will not do
a final sign-off."  (Dennis Quail, 503/823-6971; David Kish, 503/823-
5252; David Held, 517/336-6616; Pat Shod, Motorola, 708/576-6612.)

WHAT HAPPENED

     During a windstorm in Portland, Ore., on Dec. 12, roughly half of
the emergency workers using a Motorola 800 MHz trunking system were
unable to hear their dispatchers, according to David Kish, Portland
general services director.  The system failure lasted roughly five
hours.  Kish said the problem has been traced to a control channel
that was set for both voice and data, when it should have been set
only for data.  
     When the system was flooded with calls during the windstorm, it
was unable to assign channels quickly enough.  According to Kish, the
problem was exasperated by workers who kept clicking their units,
rather than clicking them once, then waiting for a call-back. 
     Kish said that nothing bad happened as a result of the outage. 
Emergency workers were able to talk to one another using simplex
channels, and they improvised communications with the dispatchers
using data channels and cellular phones.  Some police and firefighters
also used a backup land mobile radio system.
     Communications services division Director Dennis Quail said that
Motorola plans to rewrite the link protocol between the SmartZone
manager and the 6809 controller to permanently fix the setting on
data.

**********************************************************************

     At press time, the FCC announced that round 14 of the 900 MHz SMR
auction took in $61.7 million, excluding withdrawal payments.  There
were 81 new bids placed, down from 86 in the previous round.

TOP 10 STORIES OF 1995

1. FCC Begins Refarming of Private Land Mobile Radio Spectrum Below
512 MHz: The commission adopted the latest in a series of refarming
orders to increase spectrum efficiency.  The fallout in equipment
choices, channel availability and frequency coordination will be felt
for years (LMRN, June 16, Oct. 20, Dec. 1).

2. FCC Tries To Please Big and Small With 800 MHz SMR Order:  The
commission walked a narrow tightrope--some might call it a plank--in
trying to balance the interests of large and small specialized mobile
radio companies in its December order.  Barring delays, look for
auctions in late spring or early summer.  Small companies mounted one
of the largest land mobile lobbying campaigns in recent memory to
protect their interests (LMRN, Sept. 22, Dec. 22). 

3. AT&T, MCI and Sprint Enter the Paging Marketplace:  The big-three
long-distance companies all got into paging this year in a big way: 
MCI Communications Corp. through resale agreements with SkyTel Corp.
and Paging Network Inc.; Sprint Corp. through a resale agreement with
Paging Network Inc.; and AT&T through its purchase of McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc. (LMRN, Jan. 6, Sept. 29, Dec. 15).

4. FCC Issues 'Wish List' To Improve FCC Procedures:  A 32-page FCC
report on reinventing government provided the foundation for several
far-reaching initiatives, including the proposed expansion of the
FCC's auction authority--now proposed as part of the 1996 budget bill-
-and the simplifying of application procedures (LMRN, Feb. 3).

5. SMR Industry Growth Kept on Ice:  MTA-EMCI Inc. this fall predicted
that the number of specialized mobile radio (SMR) subscribers would
grow 13 percent this year.  Observers blamed part of the lackluster
growth on regulatory uncertainty at 800 MHz, including an application
freeze dating from the summer of 1994.

6. Public Safety Advisory Committee Formed: The Public Safety Wireless
Advisory Committee was formed this summer to determine public safety
spectrum requirements to the year 2010.  Hearing complaints that the
FCC and National Telecommunications and Information Administration
sometimes worked at cross-purposes, the House Subcommittee on
Appropriations (Commerce) asked the two to jointly sponsor the public
safety committee (LMRN, Aug. 4).

7. Congress Proposes Uniform Antenna Tower Rules:  The House version
of the telecommunications deregulation bill (H.R. 1555) would direct
the FCC to adopt policies regarding state and local regulation of
towers for commercial mobile radio services providers.  A compromise
version between the House and Senate versions of the bill still is
being worked out (LMRN, May 19).

8. 220 MHz Players May Be Forced To Return Money to Arizona Investors:
Specialized mobile radio (SMR) companies sat up this summer when we
reported that the Arizona Corporation Commission had accused SMR
Advisory Group, L. C. and several affiliated companies and executives
of running afoul of securities laws.  The case reflects efforts to
crack down on the sale of unregistered securities to ill-informed
investors (LMRN, July 21).  The case may be decided in early 1996.

9. APCO 25 Celebrates Incomplete Standard:  Although the Association
of Public Safety Communications Officials International Inc.
celebrated completion of the APCO 25 digital standard, critics were
quick to point out that the association still had work to do on the
trunking protocols (LMRN, Aug. 18).

10. SkyTel Launches Two-way Paging:  SkyTel Corp. got the jump on
rival paging carriers this fall by becoming the first company to
launch two-way paging service over narrowband personal communications
services (PCS) channels.  Although Motorola Inc. was forced to take
back an early batch of defective units, by December SkyTel executives
said that several thousand units were in the hands of paying customers
(LMRN, Sept. 22, Dec. 1).

NEW DEFINITIONS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC SERVICES

     The next meeting of the Public Safety Wireless Advisory
Committee-slated for Jan. 7-9 in Berkeley, Calif.--will take place,
even if the FCC and National Telecommunications and Information
Administration remain shut down.  The committee approved the following
definitions at its mid-December meeting.  
Public Safety:  The public's right, exercised through federal, state
or local government as prescribed by law, to protect and preserve
life, property, and natural resources and to serve the public welfare.
Public Safety Services: Those services rendered by or through federal,
state, or local government entities in support of public safety
duties.  (Don Speights, 202/482-1652; http://www.pcia.com.)

AMTA TO ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION OF 800 MHZ ORDER

     The American Mobile Telecommunications Association plans to ask
the FCC to reconsider its decision not to offer bidding credits to
small businesses in the 800 MHz SMR auctions slated for the middle of
this year (LMRN, Dec. 22).  The request likely will be filed by mid-
February in a petition for reconsideration and clarification.  The
association also plans to ask for an extension of the 800 MHz
rulemaking proposal's comment period.
     AMTA will decide what else to ask for in a meeting of its small
business council, regulatory forum and board of directors later this
month, Lyon said.       Along with bidding credits, AMTA likely will
ask the FCC to reconsider its plan to partly base the upfront payment
on how incumbered a license is.  Lyon called this equation burdensome
both for the commission and for bidders.  AMTA also will ask the FCC
to clarify how it plans to allow early nego-tiations between
incumbents and prospective auction winners.  What if these companies
do not win? asked Lyon.  Will they still have to pay the costs of
retuning the incumbents?  (AMTA, 202/331-7773.)

MOTOROLA HAVING TROUBLE MEETING DEMAND FOR PAGERS

     Motorola Inc.'s factories have not been keeping up with the
orders for pagers placed by at least one key customer.  A Motorola
spokesperson said that supply is expected to catch up with demand in
the next couple of months.  She attributed the shortfall to the fast
growth of the U.S. paging market, which took Motorola by surprise.
     During an analysts' teleconference Jan. 3, Steven Jacoby, chief
operating officer of Metrocall Inc., said that since the beginning of
August, Motorola has not been able to fill its pager orders on time.  
     The situation has improved "tremendously" in the last few weeks,
to the point where Motorola fills roughly 90 percent of any particular
Metrocall order on time, he said.  On time means four to six weeks,
Jacoby said. 
     However, Metrocall still is having difficulty getting enough
Ultra Express and Encore numeric pagers and Advisor alphanumeric
pagers to meet demand.  
     Jacoby said that the entire industry has felt the pager
shortfall.  Indeed, a spokesman for Paging Network Inc., the country's
largest paging carrier, acknowledged "periodic" shortages at Motorola. 
However, they have had no impact on the company's subscriber growth,
he said.
     Vincent Kelly, Metrocall chief financial officer, told analysts
that the company logged its strongest subscriber growth ever in the
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.  It added more than 60,000 paging units
in service.  That is a leap over the third quarter's 42,000 gain, when
pager delays were at their worst.  
     "The problem that we had [that] quarter ... was [that] we
couldn't get our hands on product--period," said Kelly.   
     Metrocall's stock had dropped 39 percent from $29 on Sept. 21 to
$17.75 the day of the conference (Jan. 3).  Yesterday (Jan. 4), the
stock fell another $1.25 to $16.50.  Here are some other facts that
emerged in the analysts's meeting, in which company officials
attempted to shore up investor confidence.  
     *  Metrocall has its eye on several possible acquisition targets,
which together have more than 700,000 subscribers.  Currently the
company, the country's sixth-largest carrier, has an estimated 940,000
subscribers.
     *  Metrocall is talking with five paging carriers about reselling
their advanced paging services over narrowband PCS channels.  
     *  More than 41 percent of the company's subscriber base has been
won by indirect distribution channels.  Metrocall recently signed
distribution agreements with nationwide retailer Ritz Camera Centers
Inc., Beltsville, Md., and catalog sales company Crutchfield Corp.,
Charlottesville, Va.
     *  The company recently increased its direct sales force by 100
people.

IN BRIEF

     Glenayre Technologies Inc.  has introduced new network standards
designed to increase paging network capacity by nearly 100 times.  The
new protocols are called Wireless Messaging transfer protocol (WMtp)
and the Wireless Messaging application programming interface (WMapi). 
WMtp, which can coexist with the Telocator Network Paging Protocol
(TNPP).  It is based on the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol (TCP/IP) used in the Internet and allows operators to
transmit Internet mail to pagers.  WMapi lets service providers create
two-way messaging applications for narrowband personal communications
services (PCS) networks, including those supporting Telocator Message
Entry (TME) standard.  (Irene Moore, 770/623-2449.)

     MobileMedia Corp. (MBLM) plans to introduce single-frequency
pagers in the second quarter of 1996.   Company officials said the
switch to one frequency will allow consumers to upgrade their paging
services or to relocate without changing their pager.  Separately,
yesterday (Jan. 4) MobileMedia completed its purchase of BellSouth
MobileComm for roughly $930 million.  (Jean Coppenbarger, MobileComm,
601/977-1648.)

     At press time, Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Corp.
announced that it had added 135,600 paging and voice messaging units
in service in the fourth quarter, ended Dec. 31.  All told last year,
the company added 561,900 units, to break the million-units-in-service
mark.  Separately, the company named John Palmer, Mtel Chairman, as
acting CEO.  Bernard Puckett will step down to become a company
consultant.  The company expects to name a replacement for Pucket in
the near future.  (Scott Hamilton, Mtel, 601/944-3800.)

PAGING INDUSTRY BRACES FOR AUCTIONS OF 931 MHz LICENSES

     The paging industry is facing the prospect of competitive bidding
of one-way paging licenses for the first time.  Well over half of the
FCC's backlog of 8,000 931-MHz paging applications are mutually
exclusive, and those applications are likely to be awarded by
auctions, industry sources said.  
     According to Don Vasek, senior issues manager-industry affairs
for the Personal Communications Industry Association, the commission
since June 1995 has talked about adopting a rulemaking proposal to
resolve the mutually exclusive licenses.  However, we were unable to
contact FCC officials to comment on an expected release date due to
the partial government shutdown.  
     Vasek's talks with FCC officials suggest that the commission will
select major trading areas (MTAs) and basic trading areas (BTAs) as
the geographic boundaries for the licenses.  It also will choose
auctions to award them, he believes.

  ...Other Applications Also Pending 

     The FCC essentially has had an application freeze in place at 931
MHz since December 1994, Vasek said.  Part of the holdup stems from
the lack of a spectrum-sharing treaty with Mexico.  
     The commission had planned to meet with Mexican officials late
last month to decide how to share paging frequencies in border areas. 
At press time, we were unable to find out whether an agreement had
been reached.  The commission has been reluctant to grant new
applications for fear that the treaty--or lack of one--would have a
"daisy-chain" effect on existing and pending licenses, Vasek said.
     In addition, over the past six months the FCC has been developing
software and improving its data base to automate the processing of 931
MHz applications.  That software has just been completed, Vasek said. 
     According to Vasek, several dozen paging carriers, from small
local operators up to nationwide carriers, have 931 MHz applications
pending.  He said the expected rulemaking may ask the industry to
comment on whether the new regulatory framework at 931 MHz should also
be applied to 929 MHz, UHF and VHF bands.  
     Vasek said that there is "probably little chance of that
happening," however, because those frequencies have been used heavily
for "years and years and years."
