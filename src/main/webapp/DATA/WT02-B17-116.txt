<B>Production of Hydrogen by Thermocatalytic Cracking of Natural 

Gas;<br>

N. Muradov, Principal Investigator,<br> Florida Solar Energy 

Center</B>

<P>

In the next few decades hydrogen production will continue to rely on 
fossil fuels, 

primarily, natural gas.  The conventional method of hydrogen production 
from natural gas 

is steam reforming, a complex multi-step process resulting in the 
emission of large 

quantities of CO<sub>2</sub>  into the atmosphere.  One alternative is 
the single-step thermocatalytic 

decomposition (or cracking) of natural gas into hydrogen and carbon.

<P>

The thermocatalytic decomposition of methane over various catalysts and 
supports in a 

wide range of temperatures (500-900&#176;C) and flow rates was studied.  
A catalyst activity 

tests were conducted using two types of catalytic reactors; continuous 
flow and pulse 

reactors.  The temperature dependence of the hydrogen production yield 
using metal and 

metal oxide forms of different catalysts was studied.  It was found that 
alumina-supported 

Ni and Fe catalysts exhibited high activity in methane decomposition 
reaction.  Pt/alumina 

catalyst rapidly lost its catalytic activity.  The experimental results 
indicate that for the 

given pressure and space velocity the maximum hydrogen yield is a 
function of 

temperature.  It was demonstrated that a short induction period of 
hydrogen production 

over Ni- and Fe-based catalysts corresponded to the reduction of metal 
oxide to the 

metallic form of the catalyst.  Variation in the operational parameters 
makes it possible to 

produce CH4-H2 mixtures with the wide range of hydrogen concentrations 
from 30 to 

98% by volume.  It was found that Ni-based catalysts are more suitable 
for the operational 

temperatures below 750&#176;C, whereas Fe-based catalysts can be used at 
temperatures 800&#176;C 

and higher for the production of hydrogen with purity up to 95% by 
volume and 

higher.

<P>

The studied process can be the basis for the development of the compact 
catalytic units for 

on-site production of the hydrogen-methane blends at gas refueling 
stations and for CO<sub>2</sub> -

free production of hydrogen for the fuel cell driven prime movers.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I>:</b>

<P>
We conducted a series of experiments on methane decomposition

using tubular reactors made out of different materials:  quartz,

alumina, stainless steel, and nickel.  The objective was to recover

carbon from the inner wall of the reactor.  The reaction of methane

decomposition was carried out at a temperature range of 850-870&#176;C

and atmospheric pressure.  The maximum hydrogen concentration

in the effluent gas using a stainless steel tubular reactor was

less than 10% v.  There was no methane decomposition reaction

detected in the quartz reactor.  The ceramic (alumina) reactor

demonstrated negligible activity (H<sub>2</sub>  concentration, 0.2% 
v.).

 The reactor made out of nickel tube demonstrated the highest

activity in methane decomposition reaction.  After the methane

decomposition reaction was completed, carbon was mechanically

removed from the reactor wall.  This procedure was repeated three

times.  We observed that the hydrogen concentration in the effluent

gas after the first, second and third runs were 45.6%, 39.6%, and

43.3% by volume, respectively.  This is indication of effective

recovery of carbon from the catalytic reactor.
