FOOD COMPANIES WITH A HEART SHOULD LOOK TO SOUTH ASIA

Despite the increased supply of food and an upturn in social
conditions, malnutrition remains a serious problem in South
Asia.
It also presents an opportunity for firms and nonprofit
organizations that want to focus their charitable food-
distribution efforts. The region includes Bhutan, Bangladesh,
India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka-Qwith a
population
of 1.22 billion people.

More than one-half the world's underweight children of
preschool
age are South Asian. With the region's population growing
faster
than its economy, food availability remains relatively low,
and
has not shown much improvement in recent years.

Problems include a lack of education of mothers as well as
poor
distribution systems. Officials say it is clear that
educating
women is one key to improving nutrition in the region. The
chart
above shows the number of girls who are enrolled in primary
school
for every 100 boys in the same age group.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in
the
1980s, the share of underfed in the region fell 6 percent.
South
Asia's per capita food energy supply grew from about 2,070
kilocalories daily in 1975 to almost 2,250 kilocalories in
1990.
But the region's 101 million underweight children are still
nearly
double the number in Sub-Saharan Africa. Malnutrition stunts
the
mental and physical growth of one-third of children in the
region,
says the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).

A large proportion of this is caused by deficiencies of
Vitamin A,
iodine, and iron. Nearly one-half the children in the group
aged 6
to 11 in Bangladesh and almost one-third in the tiny
Himalayan
kingdom of Bhutan, are afflicted with goiter caused by iodine
deficiency, which retards brain development.

United Nations officials are puzzled by the persistence of
high
levels of malnutrition in the region.

"We in UNICEF believe there must be something wrong with the
strategies being used," says regional chief Urban Jonsson. He
points out that South Asian governments are the largest
spenders
on nutrition, but with little effect.

There is, however, some good news from nongovernmental,
community-
based programs.

SUCCESS STORIES
In Bangladesh, severe protein malnutrition dropped 14 percent
between 1985 and 1994 in areas covered by locally run
schemes.
Similar initiatives in India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka
have
slashed nutritional deficiencies dramatically. About 20
community-
based projects have been singled out as successful by the
UNICEF
South Asia office, which suggests that governments can learn
from
these success stories.

South Asia can also learn from Thailand, which UNICEF cites
as the
best example of a nation that improved national nutrition
policies
and strategies on the basis of the experience of community
projects.

Political commitment at all levels, a high level of literacy,
especially among women, community organization and
involvement,
and the infrastructure that can deliver basic services were
among
the key factors for the success of nutrition strategies
identified
at a regional meeting.

"Long term nutrition improvements in the region are strongly
associated with female educational levels. Research in
Pakistan
has shown that the likelihood of having an underweight child
in
the household where the mother has no education is three
times
that of the household where the mother has primary
education,"
says a paper presented at a regional meeting on National
Plans of
Action for Nutrition.

The trend of female enrollment at secondary level is upwards,
from
24 percent in 1975 to 35 percent in 1990, but the region's
progress in educating females is still too slow to make a
dent in
malnutrition.

JAPANESE CONTINUE TRADITION OF GIFT GIVING

The high value of the yen is opening up the vast Japanese
gifts
market to foreign suppliers. Japanese people give each other
YEN10
trillion (US$96 billion) in gifts each year. While the
corporate
gifts market has shrunk in this tough business time, personal
gift
giving is thriving and was worth YEN7.7 trillion (US$74
billion)
in 1994.

A report from the Hong Kong Trade Development Council says
that
Japanese consumers' tastes are increasingly diversified, and
their
sales of imported gift products should increase. The greatest
personal gift givers are Japanese women in their 20s and 30s.
They
tend to favor inexpensive, fashionable items such as
handkerchiefs, pouches, well-designed jewelry, and
accessories.

Gift-giving is well ingrained in Japan's culture. Apart from
set
events such as religious ceremonies or weddings, birthdays or
the
birth of a baby, presents are given to neighbors, relatives,
and
acquaintances. Young people give gifts to friends and
coworkers to
express feelings of gratitude, happiness, or sometimes
sadness.

For the business gift, popular items used by companies for
promotions or incentives include electronics (calculators,
watches) small electrical appliances, kitchenware, interior
items
such as CD racks, travel bags, stationery, knitted goods,
flashlights, pocket cameras, and lighters.

ASIAN MEN MAY BE THE NEXT BIG SKIN-CARE MARKET

As Asia's population ages, it is possible to cash in on a
number
of new trends in skin care, according to reports in Asian
Retailer. Postwar baby boomers in Asia are beginning to see
signs
of wear and tear in the mirror. Couple this with greater
affluence, and the breakdown of social taboos that have
prevented
men from buying cosmetic products and new opportunities
emerge.

The magazine reports that high-class cosmetics houses are
riding
high on a boom in antiaging creams and potions, and already
lower-
priced versions of these lines are hitting the supermarket
toiletry departments. It says that the Watson pharmaceutical
store
chain of Hong Kong finds that antiaging merchandise is
becoming
important in its product line.

Among the skin-care buying customers is an increasing number
of
men. While few products are targeted directly to Asian men,
there
are indications that men are buying women's products,
especially
those with little or no fragrance.

Other items that are growing in demand are blood pressure
monitors, anti-cholesterol remedies, vitamins, and health
food
supplements.

TIME PAYMENTS INCREASE BUYING POWER IN HO CHI MINH CITY

Sales of imported goods in Ho Chi Minh City have jumped with
the
reintroduction of time payments, but they are not for
everyone,
according to Vietnam Investment Review. The fortnightly
business
newspaper, which is published in Vietnamese and English,
reports
that more than 100 shops in the commercial capital of
southern
Vietnam now offer credit on everything from a new Honda to
the
latest personal computer equipment. Relatively strict
conditions
apply: some stores provide credit to state employees only,
while
at others the customer must have a certificate from his or
her
employer guaranteeing repayments will be deducted from wages.

With time payments, demand for computers has increased by 150
percent as higher-income Vietnamese use the new payment
schemes.
There is tough competition among about 100 computer stores in
Ho
Chi Minh City, and other marketing devices include special
offers
for students and for new businesses.

Not everyone is happy. Domestic manufacturers complain that
sales
of their generally less-expensive models are dropping as
consumers
use credit to afford more-expensive, usually imported, items.

JAPANESE TAKE THEIR COLD REMEDIES SERIOUSLY

Getting to school and work every day is an obsession with the
Japanese, no matter how ill they feel. That may be one reason
that
the Japanese spend $5 per capita every year soothing the
common
cold, the most spent by any of the world's six largest
markets for
cough and cold remedies. Cold remedies represent 11 percent
of the
Japanese market for the entire sector.

While the Japanese focus on colds, residents of the United
States
spend about the same amount per capita ($5.50) for cough
remedies,
according to MarketLine International.

MarketLine analysts say that the market for over-the-counter
(OTC)
remedies can be expected to grow as Japan joins other
developed
countries in trying to cut back on healthcare expenditures
and
instilling a sense of personal responsibility in consumers.

While many U.S. and European companies are entering the
Japanese
OTC market, Taisho Pharmaceutical company, which is
practically
unknown outside the Japanese market, continues to hold a
strong
position.

ROOM FOR GROWTH IN INSURANCE IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION

The Pacific Rim, which in 1993 had insurance premiums of
about
$375.8 billion, has the greatest potential for insurance
market
growth of all regions in the world, according to a new report
on
insurance in emerging markets, published by Datamonitor
International.

China alone represents about one-quarter of the world's
population
but ranks 25th in terms of premium income. Its premium growth
rate
is about 30 percent a year and it currently has a per capita
premium income of just $3, compared with per capita premiums
of
about $473 in Taiwan. China is typical of the markets in the
region that combine high premium income growth with very low
insurance penetration.

The combination has started to tempt multinational insurers
who
realize that a rapidly growing, but immature market adds up
to
untapped opportunity.

Other countries with high market potential, such as India and
the
Philippines, have really not started to grow yet. India will
shortly privatize its entire insurance industry, which should
create competition-based growth that will start to release
the
market's potential.

Currently, Japan's insurance industry dwarfs its Pacific Rim
neighbors. It is now the second-largest insurance industry in
the
world. Insurance companies have successfully adapted western
methods to suit the Japanese taste for investment. Even car
insurance often has a built-in investment element.

Japan's insurance industry registered an increase of 1.4
percent
between 1992 and 1993, compared with South Korea's growth in
the
same time period of 8.5 percent. Between 1991 and 1992, South
Korea's insurance industry grew even faster at 18 percent.

According to data from the Japan Institute of Life Insurance,
annuity policies in Japan have grown as worries about the
National
Pension Fund have grown. In 1994, 95 percent of Japanese
households had life insurance. Annuity policies have been
especially popular among the young who are worrying about
their
eventual retirement. Among all households, ownership of
annuities
rose 7.6 percentage points between 1991 and 1994, while they
rose
from 9 percent to 24.6 percent among people under age 30.

New life insurance products for women have contributed to the
growth in Japan and women may also be prime targets for
insurance
in emerging markets as more women become contributors to
household
incomes.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE BECOMES A FLASH POINT IN NEW ZEALAND

There may be a market for teaching would-be New Zealand
immigrants
in English.

New Zealand wants to be seen as part of Asia, but it is
scaring
away Asian migrants with a compulsory English-language test,
and
immigrants are risking a more-than-$13,000 bond if they don't
learn English quickly enough.

Asian New Zealanders are unhappy with Wellington's
introduction in
1995 of an English proficiency test for would-be immigrants
which
they feel is targeted mainly at Asians.

Asian migration to New Zealand has increased rapidly in
recent
years. Migrants from North and Southeast Asia comprised
24,000 of
the 50,000 residence visas granted in the past year.

Foreigners who want to migrate to New Zealand must pay a
deposit
that will be lost if they fail to pass the English-language
proficiency exam within a year. They must also pay a $160 fee
for
their residence visas.

Learning English is not a completely academic exercise
because how
you speak English may affect your acceptance in New Zealand.
Uma
Shakti Ba, a student services development officer at Auckland
University says the way immigrants speak English largely
determines how they are treated in New Zealand. "Your accent
plays
a role in how people judge your English ability here. However
well
educated you may be in English, if you have an accent it is
seen
as incorrect. If it is not the English they wish to hear, you
will
be judged as incompetent," she told Inter Press Service.  "I
see
it happen here every day."

Government officials admit that the new language test may
dampen
immigration from some Asian countries, but they say it will
also
affect immigration from non-English-speaking European
countries.

Soo Lee Lim, director of the Auckland Chinese Radio AM 1476,
agrees that many New Zealanders are opposed to Asian
migration,
but she says there is a stronger view that New Zealand should
not
be overpopulated. "On the whole, the Kiwis are broad-minded
people. That's my experience," added Lim who migrated from
Hong
Kong five years ago.

There is, however, a strong feeling within the Asian
community
that New Zealanders should be thankful to Asians and
especially to
Asian money which helped pull New Zealand out of recession.
Asian
investments in New Zealand and the country's exports to Asia
have
risen dramatically since 1991. One-third of the country's
tourists-Qa major foreign exchange earnerQ-come from Asia.
Brunei
invested more than $20 million, for example, in 1993.
Business
experts say they have never seen this kind of wealth coming
into
the country before.

But Lim says small business migrants from Asia find it hard
to
make money here because most local products like fruits and
meats
are controlled by monopolies. "It's not easy for foreigners
to
break into this system," she said. "When we come here we have
to
start from scratch."

She says they would have made more money had they remained in
Hong
Kong. Most business migrants coming here are not from the
very
rich segment, but from the upper middle class. Typically they
are
in their 40s, and they are seeking a quiet life and a less-
pressured school environment for their children.

Migrants from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Malaysia are mostly
newly
rich who tend to show their wealth by dressing well, driving
sleek
cars, and buying big houses. "It attracts some jealousy from
the
local people," Lim said.

New Zealanders have been complaining that Asian business
immigrants are not creating jobs for locals, preferring to
run
small family businesses. "After the past four years, I think
they
are quite disappointed with us," says Lim, and business
monopolies
and communication barriers don't help either.

"Given 10 to 20 years, after we are familiar with the system
and
the customs, I'm sure we'll be able to contribute to this
country," she adds.

GOING OVERSEAS?  HERE'S AN EXCELLENT BUSINESS REFERENCE...

Whether you are hiring native employees, relocating employees
to
another country or trying to get yourself ready for a stint
overseas, a good cultural and business reference book is
invaluable.

Craighead's International Business, Travel and Relocation
Guide to
78 Countries,1996-97 includes a general introduction to each
country, an economic and political overview, sections on
doing
business in the country, money, banking and taxes,
communications
and media, living in the country, health and safety,
preparing for
a trip, arriving and getting around, lodging, dining and
nightlife, leisure activities, and suggested additional
reading.

The three-volume set is useful because the country reports,
though
designed for the business person, also take into
consideration the
family. In the "doing business" chapter, for example, there
are
sections on work ethics, employment conditions, power
structure
and hierarchy, business networking and business services. For
most
countries, there is a commentary especially addressing the
concerns of business women.

For personal consideration, such issues as taxes, housing,
household help, importing pets, and driving conditions and
owning
a car are covered. The guide lists restaurants, cafes,
museums,
and other places that you might wish to take a colleague if
it is
up to you to make the social arrangements.

We were especially happy to see references that we do not see
elsewhere such as information on faith healers in the
Philippines
or the importance of remittances to the economy of that
country.
Again in the report on the Philippines, readers are warned
not to
rent a house or apartment that doesn't already  have a
working
phone line installed. The reason is that installation of a
telephone may take six weeks to six months or longer. You
will
also learn that corporations often use messengers for local
communications because telephone service is so unreliable.

COMMUNIST CHINESE COMBINE HISTORY WITH CAPITALISM

Hoping to capitalize on a domestic audience of well over 1
billion
people, a group of old Chinese revolutionaries is planning a
theme
park to celebrate one of the seminal events of China's
Communist
history.

Known as the "Long March Park of the Red Army" and located on
a
240-acre site in a southwestern Beijing suburb, the park
would
commemorate the trek 60 years ago in which the beleaguered
Communist forces sought to escape annihilation by the
nationalist
government of General Chiang Kai-Shek.

Theme parks are not new to China. Yunnan province in southern
China is home to a multimillion dollar park reflecting
Chinese
society, particularly its varied ethnic minorities, while a
Chinese version of Disneyland, to be funded by overseas
investors,
is reportedly under discussion.

In 1934, besieged Chinese communists led by Mao Zedung broke
a
blockade by the Kuomintang (KMT) nationalist party and
embarked on
a year-long, 6,000-mile escape that became known as the Long
March. Many of the 80,000 men died as they traveled over the
uncompromising terrain. It has gone down as a heroic saga in
Chinese Communist history.

In order to draw crowds and better depict the historical
event,
organizers are seeking to use all the latest technological
and
special effects normally associated with Western-style theme
parks.

The park will include sound and lighting effects, a simulated
firing range, a space observatory, movie theaters, ferris
wheels
and merry-go-rounds, cable cars, and rides on army tanks and
armored personnel carriers, and it would even include China's
first bungee-jumping tower.

"We want to show the Long March events and recreate them to a
scale for the general public," said Liu Chengan, a Communist
Party
official involved in the planning, adding that the park will
have
other attractions in order to draw the crowds.

Tourist developments
With social freedom and money to travel, a growing number of
China's 1.2 billion people are making pilgrimages to
rediscover
the country's revolutionary past. To cash in on the travel
rush,
government officials are converting revolutionary bases into
tourist meccas.

In Hunan province, for example, restaurants and hotels
appeared
to accommodate the tourist influx that accompanied the
celebration
of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the late Party
chairman
Mao Zedong. The main drawing card was Shaoshan, Zedong's
hometown.

In November, China Daily, the official English-language
newspaper,
reported another tourist development in the Jinggang
Mountains on
the border of Hunan and Jianqxi provinces, where Mao and
other
Communist revolutionaries first launched their peasant
uprising
against the Chinese nationalists.

Although such initiatives would have shocked Chinese
officials 20
years ago, no one in today's China is bothered by the idea of
Communism's historic past being a selling point for today's
businessmen.

Planners say that today's young people are so ill-informed
about
and uninterested in recent history that it would be a waste
of
time to try to teach them without the Western-style
packaging.
They say they must combine amusement with education.

Getting funding for the $20 million Long March Park is
proving
difficult.  Planners are unlikely to seek foreign investment
because that would be embarrassing to the government, which
has
not yet confirmed monetary commitment to the park. Planners
had
hoped to break ground in 1995, but have not because of a lack
of
funding.

Organizers also have logistical problems to iron out. Local
officials project that as many as 10,000 visitors a day would
come
to the park even with a $5 entrance fee. But they apparently
don't
know how they would move all those people around the hilly
terrain
and winding roads.

TIANJIN IS AN UNDERDEVELOPED CITY WITH IMMENSE PROMISE

A walk along the Haihe River in downtown Tianjin City is a
surprisingly peaceful affair, especially for China. A few
motorcycles and cars (mostly taxis) cruise the riverside
road, but
overall, the impression is of a sleepy town, not one of
China's
second most important industrial center and container port.

Tianjin is the least known of the three urban centersQ-the
others
are Beijing and Shanghai-Qthat are under direct control of
the
national government. Located 90 miles southeast of Beijing,
Tianjin is often overshadowed by its more important neighbor.
Nevertheless, it has gained a reputation as one of China's
best-
run cities and has become a favorite of several major Western
and
Japanese manufacturers. But Tainjin's development has been
much
quieter than that of splashy Shanghai or powerful Beijing.

This is a conservative city, but one whose foundation and
strategies for the future give it a substance unusual in
free-
flowing, fast-growing urban China.

Tianjin has a population of more than 8.8 million. More than
two-
thirds (5.8 million in 1993) of the population lives in the
city
center and its suburbs. The United Nations estimates the
population of the urban agglomeration at 10.4 million in
1994,
with a projected growth to 17 million by 2015. It ranks 14th
among
the world's largest urban agglomerations.

The city center has a unique flavor, mixing a variety of 19th
century European architecture styles, highlighting its
history as
a treaty port, similar to, yet very different from,
Shanghai.
Shanghai was only a small fishing village until the arrival
of
Westerners. Tianjin has a long history as an important
trading
center in China, in no small part due to its location so
close to
Beijing, yet with easy access to both inland and port
navigation
routes.

The municipality encompasses 11,305 sq. km. and includes five
rural counties in addition to urban center and suburbs.  It
is
China's third-largest city and a major hub with some of the
best
transportation links in the country. It is also a pleasant
city,
with more than one hundred parks, both large and small.

Per capita living space is small at 6.9 sq. m. The city
endured a
highly destructive earthquake in 1976 (in Tangshan) that
closed it
for a couple of years and forced the reconstruction of a
substantial amount of its housing. All households have
running
water, but hot water availability is small. Use of household
gas
is high, 89 percent in 1993, compared with 86 percent in
Beijing.

The municipality's economy is one of China's largest, with a
Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of 53 billion yuan in 1993.  The
economy is
centered on automobiles, electronics, and chemicals. The city
has
one of China's largest automobile manufacturing industries,
built
in conjunction with Japanese automakers, and has been on the
cutting edge of telecommunications production under the
leadership
of companies such as Motorola.

Tianjin was one of the first cities to set up a Foreign
Investment
Office and a Foreign Services Center. This city is expected
to
emerge as an "export center," although until the last few
years,
imports exceeded exports. Nevertheless, with the high-quality
leadership of its former mayor, Li Ruihuan, the city began to
develop its status as a forward-thinking, yet conservative,
economic center.

Growth has been consistent and not insubstantial, and Tianjin
has
become a favorite of foreign investors. However, the city
still
possesses a surprisingly underdeveloped consumer market.

Tianjin Consumers
Tianjin's residents' quality of life lags somewhat behind
that of
residents in China's other major coastal cities (Beijing,
Shanghai, and Guangzhou). Per capita GDP in 1993 was 6,075
yuan,
70 percent of Beijing's and only one-half that of Shanghai
and
Guangzhou. Overall, however, the standard of living is higher
than
in the nation as a whole, with residents consuming 42 percent
more
than the national average.

Consumption patterns
Expenditures on all major categories of goods have increased
substantially since 1990. Expenditures on food increased 51
percent from 1990 to 1993. Even more importantly, the desire
for
diversity, edibility, and convenience has been growing among
Tianjin's consumers.

Food consumption represents over 54 percent of all living
expenditures, a larger share than in the nation as a whole.
Tianjin is a meat-eating city, with larger-han-average
consumption of beef and lamb which, to a degree, reflects the
eating traditions of the region. As a proportion of total
expenditures, sugar consumption is less than in Shanghai and
Beijing, but more is spent on other flavorings.

Vegetable consumption has not increased substantially in the
last
several years, but according to a 1991 consumer survey, the
supply
and variety of vegetables have increased.  Tianjin has been
an
active participant in the "vegetable basket" project,
designed to
provide ample supplies of food, especially vegetables, for
urban
dwellers.

The 1991 consumer survey also suggested that 61 percent of
Tianjin's residents are concerned with nutritional values.
Only 11
percent, however, were interested in specialty products,
brand
names, and delicacies. Current figures for these items are no
doubt significantly higher, as imports and processed foods
have
become increasingly available. Now the supermarket sections
of
department stores are filled with a variety of Chinese and
Western
snacks and sweets, and these store sections are jammed with
customers.

Western retailing in the city has lagged significantly behind
foreign investment in the city.  The main shopping streets of
Tianjin are narrow and filled with a variety of small shops,
restaurants, ice cream stores, and only one major modern
department store. Although situated just a few blocks from
the
quiet riverfront, these streets are busy. The ambiance is
more
traditional here than in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
With
few high-profile non-Chinese retailers, the retail district
reflects the traditional preference for localizing individual
product lines along streets. Thus, off the main shopping
street,
one can find the flower street, the wedding street, and most
importantly, several centers for textiles.

Tianjin remains an important textile center, and 18 percent
of
total retail purchases were for clothing in 1993.  Not
surprisingly, Tianjiners prefer conservative styles. Clothes
tend
to be modern, tailored, yet comfortable. Fashion trends do
not
drive clothing purchases in the way they do in Shanghai or
Guangzhou, but quality is important.

Consumers in Tianjin are often considered by market
researchers
and retailers as a subset of the Beijing market, in spite of
its
own long consumer tradition, dating back to its years as a
treaty
port.  It is large enough, and important enough, to be
considered
in its own right.

A LIFESTYLE ENTERPRISE
The first, and still only, non-Chinese department store was
opened
by Isetan (a Japanese retailer) in 1993.  Isetan Tianjin
adjusted
its product lines and price points to accommodate the lower
incomes and preferences of local residents.

Located next to the main train station across the river from
downtown, yet within walking distance of the city center,
this
store has not been constricted by the narrow streets and
limited
retail space on the other side of the river.  It is thus able
to
carry a wider range of goods in various price ranges. Isetan
still
caters primarily, though not exclusively, to high-middle-
income
earners. Nevertheless with its location, size, and diversity,
this
store has become what the company describes as a "lifestyle
enterprise" for Tianjin.

Ownership of major consumer durables compares favorably with
both
Beijing and Shanghai. In 1993, for every 100 households,
there
were 77 sewing machines, 89 refrigerators, and 43 stereo
recorders. Ownership of other consumer goods, such as VCRs,
stereo
systems, and computer games was less, but still substantial,
and
conforms to the phases of distribution in household income
defined
in the consumer survey. Household electrical appliances and
durable goods were the first phase, gold jewelry and
cosmetics
were the second phase, and interior decorating materials and
small
household appliances were the third phase.

Consumerism may not have overwhelmed this city quite yet, but
its
components are clearly expanding. Television ownership is at
almost 100 percent of households, and the shrinking of book
and
magazine readership reflects trends underway nationally.
According
to one estimate, one favorite television program in Tianjin,
aired
during the lunch hour, is watched by almost three-quarters of
the
residents.

Similarly, in the last two to three years, expanding
telecommunications has become a central goal of the city,
aided in
no small part by investments of telecommunications giants
such as
Motorola and GE. In 1994, 18 percent of urban residents had a
telephone, and more than one-quarter of households had
installed
phones. During that year the number of lines more than
doubled to
1.1 million. Cellular phones and pagers are becoming
increasingly
important.

Nevertheless, the relatively slow growth of Tianjin's economy
has
both held down the proliferation of high-income earners and
inhibited the consumer explosion seen in the last few years
in
Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou.

However, several economic, political, and demographic
characteristics favor the future of this northeast city and
bode
well for the continued development of its consumer market.

Location and Transportation
Tianjin is on the main Beijing-Shenyang and Beijing-Shanghai
rail
lines and just two hours by train from the capital city.
Travel
between the two cities became even easier in the last three
years
with the opening of the Beijing-Tianjin expressway.

It is Tainjin's port, though, that is the centerpiece of this
city's past and current economic development. The original
port
was on the Haihe River in Tianjin city. Heavy silting forced
it to
be moved 40 miles downstream to Tanggu on the Bo Hai Sea
prior to
World War II. This port, which lies within the municipality's
boundaries, was expanded in 1976 into a major container port.

The Tanggu port had 68 cargo berths in 1993,  of which 37 are
10,000-ton class deep-water channels. In addition, special
berths
for coal, petroleum and ore are currently being built.
Freight
volume has grown at a rate of more than 20 percent annually
in
recent years.

The basic passenger transportation infrastructure within the
city
is only now speeding up.  A short (7.4 km) and simple (trains
ride
on one track) system was built in 1982, and is currently
being
expanded.  The first phase of the upgrade began in 1995.
During
the second phase, the system will be expanded by construction
of
another 4.16 km of subway and 5.17 km of elevated railway.
Due to
be completed by 1999, this is only the first part of the
city's
plan to build a railway network totalling 170 km.

Economic Development
Since 1993, the pace of change in the city has increased.
Now it
is part of what has been described as the "third wave" of
Chinese
development. The first wave included Guangzhou in southern
China,
the second was Shanghai, and the third includes Beijing,
Tianjin,
and the provinces along the Bo Hai [Sea] Rim of northeast
China.
In 1992, the state had announced that Tianjin was to be
developed
as the socialist Hong Kong of North China. The planned
development
included expanding an already existing New Economic and
Technical
Economic Development Zone (TEDA) centered on the port in
Tanggu,
expanding Tianjin's city center into a financial center, and
developing a free trade zone within Tianjin in the next
decade.

TEDA, located in Tanggu, forty miles from the center of
Tianjin,
was cited in a series of economic reports of China's special
economic zones as the best-managed zone in the country. It
encompasses 33 sq. kilometers and has a population of
slightly
more than 227,000. Transportation between the city center and
TEDA
improved substantially with the extension of the Beijing-
Tianjin
Expressway into the zone in 1993, but construction of a
dedicated
road is still a year or so in the future. The zone, which
began
with only 12 joint venture enterprises, has grown
significantly.
By the end of September, 1994, more than 1,400 enterprises
had
located in the zone, with an output value of 100 million
yuan.
The zone has become a favorite of foreign manufacturers, who
find
its investment climate easier to manage than that of Beijing,
Shanghai or Guangzhou.

Names of companies that have invested in the New Tech Zone
read
like a who's who of international businessQcompanies such as
Otis
Elevators, Motorola, Mobil Petroleum, Coca-Cola, IBM, and
AT&T.
TEDA has clearly benefited from the quality of its
administration
and organization.

TEDA administers all aspects of the zone from a single office
with
employees drawn from universities rather than the typically
more
entrenched city authorities. Corruption, rampant in Shanghai
and
Guangzhou, is rare here.

Regulation of the zone has been designed to facilitate
investment.
Land costs have been held to less than one-half those of
Shanghai.
The power supply is consistent, and the government has set up
its
own training facilities as well as made several other
accommodations for zone investors.

Binhai Free Trade Zone and the Tianjin Financial Center
The Binhai free trade zone and the Tianjin financial center
are
designed to reinforce the overall attractiveness to foreign
investors of this city as well as to create a comprehensive
economic center. Binhai Economic Region consists of 2,270 sq.
km.
in the eastern part of Tianjin city. It has a population of
almost
one million residents, of which two-thirds are
"nonagricultural."
Significant investment has been made in this zone in an
effort to
improve its water and power supply, and several other
infrastructure developments are currently underway.

Similarly, plans are underway to create a financial center in
downtown Tianjin.  This center, covering 85,000 sq. meters is
being built with both domestic and foreign funds and is
intended
to become the major cog in a network of foreign and domestic
banking.

Prospects for the Future
Tianjin's potential for growth is substantial.  In addition
to its
strong industrial base, city residents are well-educated, and
it
is home to one of China's premier universities. Its 11.7
percent
illiteracy rate in 1990 was second only to that of Beijing
(11
percent).  Labor mobility is comparatively high, and the
labor
force is well-educated.

In addition, the leadership of Tianjin is sophisticated,
concerned
with both fiscal stability and creating a positive and
flexible
environment for investment.  Combined with a strong
infrastructure, both social and economic, this bodes well for
the
future.

The potential of this city is not going unnoticed in China,
particularly in Beijing. Lower real estate prices (less than
one-
third that of Beijing) have driven some of Beijing's newly
wealthy
residents to purchase homes in the municipality.

Nevertheless, there is a shortage of high-quality office and
living space for foreign investors. However, Tianjin's real-
estate
market has not exploded, unlike the overheated markets of
Beijing,
Shanghai, and Guangzhou, where overbuilding has distorted the
local office-space market.

With the city's solid foundation, excellent transportation,
and
high-quality infrastructure, the future looks bright for
Tianjin.
However, development in this city will likely be without
massive
investment from the central government. Beijing has, instead,
staked its future on the growth of Shanghai and the Yangtse
River
Delta.

Funding growth will have to come from creative planning by
municipal authorities.  Many of these authorities have been
discouraged because they expected that creating a high
quality
economic environment would automatically generate growth.  As
Tianjin's reputation grows, investment will likely increase.
But
in the meantime, Tianjin will remain an important, although
underdeveloped, urban center.
