MK - WASHINGTON CONSTRUCTION MERGER EFFECTIVE<p>

</b></center>

     BOISE -- Morrison Knudsen Corporation and Washington Construction 
Group, Inc. formally merged today following an affirmative vote by 
Washington Construction shareholders to approve the merger. The merger had 
previously received the unanimous approval of MK's secured creditors and
was supported by 90% of the MK shares which responded to the solicitation.<p>
     With the merger completed, MK is essentially debt free, has a net 
worth of more than $300 million, a commitment for a $200 million line of 
credit and virtually unlimited bonding capacity. MK's Engineering &amp;
Construction, Heavy Civil Construction, Environmental and Mining Groups 
will have revenue approaching $2 billion annually, a backlog of 
approximately $4 billion and 10,000 employees at work throughout the 
United States and in 25 countries.<p>
     On August 26, the company announced that it had reached agreement 
with Bank of Montreal, as  agent, for a $200 million credit facility with 
a five-year term.  MK  also reached agreement on a bonding arrangement 
with a surety syndicate led by Federal Insurance Company, The St. Paul /
Seaboard Surety and American Home Insurance Group (AIG) which provides 
complete bonding support sufficient to meet MK's business objectives.<p> 
        Effective tomorrow, common stock of Morrison Knudsen Corporation, 
will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  "MK". 
("MK_WI" for when-issued trading in the shares to be issued in early 
October pursuant to the merger agreement.)  Morrison Knudsen has
approximately 53.6 million shares of common stock outstanding.<p>
     Under MK's plan of reorganization, shareholders of record on August 
26, 1996 of old Morrison Knudsen common stock will receive a warrant 
package that entitles them to purchase 2,765,000 shares of new Morrison 
Knudsen common stock, or approximately 5% of the common stock of the newly 
merged company, at $12.00 per share for a term of 6 1/2 years.  (The 
warrants will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 
"MK_WS_WI pending issuance of the warrants in early October.) The plan 
also allows such shareholders to purchase, through primary and 
oversubscription rights which expire on September 27, 1996, certain 
securities and assets which would otherwise be exchanged for approximately 
45% of MK's secured pre-petition debt with the proceeds of any such rights 
exercise being payable to the holders of such secured debt.<p>  
     Washington Construction Group, Inc. brings to the merger operations 
in infrastructure construction, contract mining, environmental 
remediation, commercial construction and construction material markets 
serving both government and private customers in the western United 
States.<p>
     Morrison Knudsen Corporation (NYSE: MK), founded in 1912, serves the 
world's environmental, industrial, mining, operations & maintenance, 
power, process, transportation and heavy construction markets as an 
engineer and constructor.<p>
