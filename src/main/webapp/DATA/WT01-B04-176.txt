<TITLE>Drug Watch Position on Drug User Accountability</TITLE>
<H4>Drug Watch International:</H4><H2>Position Statement on Drug User Accountability</H2>
</CENTER>
Drug users, like any other members of society, must be held accountable for
their actions. Illicit drug use should bring swift and cost effective
consequences which will benefit the user and society at large. Every segment
of society must send the message that drug use and drug use behavior will not
be tolerated. Drug user accountability must be a cornerstone of national and
international drug policy.
<P>
<STRONG>Background:</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>In Australia and New Zealand :</STRONG> Social Policy Advisors to the Australian and
New Zealand Governments have pushed the Harm Reduction model exclusively.  More liberal laws exist in Australia than in New Zealand.  However, contrary to news media reports, most Australian states have not decriminalized marijuana. The National Organisation for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) is very active in both countries. The focus of their thrust seems to be the Universities.  In July 1995 the students of Auckland University voted against decriminalisation, which was quite a setback for NORML.  The editor of the student magazine, who described the student common room as a drug
"supermarket," is now in hiding. His life has been threatened.  
<P>
Both New Zealand and Australia have seen dramatic increases in methadone and morphine maintenance programmes, free needles, condoms, with accent on
behaviour modification, ie: teaching children and adolescents how to use
drugs safely, "The Merseyside Model" and teaching alcoholics how to drink
safely. The good news is that the New Zealand Health Minister issued a
proclamation "Cannabis Causes Harm," which contradicts the present liberal
philosophies.
<P>
<STRONG>In Canada: </STRONG>Illicit drug use began its climb in Canada in the 1960's and
reached its peak in the mid 1970's.  Initially the response was almost
entirely enforcement oriented.  However, it was soon recognized that
prevention efforts would have to be increased. The most successful strategy
consisted of three initiatives: enforcement, prevention and treatment. Using
this formula, a downward trend of drug use among the student population was
enjoyed until approximately 1992/1993, when the trend began to climb.
 Analysis of this shift revealed the topic of substance abuse had dropped off
the political agenda of all levels of government, and therefore few resources
were dedicated to it.
<P>
Presently, in Canada, there exists an organized campaign to re-direct
resources from strategies designed to eliminate inappropriate drug use to those strategies directed at the symptoms of drug use. These strategies come under the umbrella of "Harm Reduction" which is difficult to criticize given the converse position is to increase harm. A closer look at this concept allows us to realize there are two types of movements utilizing the term "Harm Reduction." The first is a genuine compassion for the addicted 
person which employs harm reduction strategies as part of a treatment program where  the ultimate goal is to rid the person of drug dependency. The second type of "harm  reduction" movement supports the liberalization of drug laws and or/legalization of the drugs themselves. This concept accepts a level of and actually promotes drug use.
<P>
<STRONG>In England: </STRONG>The Government's position is clearly against legalisation and for
prevention, education and treatment.  Prime Minister John Major recently
wrote, "Drugs are a menace to our society.  They can wreck the lives of
individuals and their  families.  They are a frequent cause of crime.  That is why we have toughened laws against drugs and why we have given the police and Customs the powers
and the resources to enforce those laws effectively.  Those efforts are
delivering  results.  Strong enforcement action has gone hand in hand with
measures to reduce demand. Since 1990, the Home Office Drugs Prevention
Initiative has supported over 1,000 projects to help local communities tackle
the drugs problem.  Drug education is part of the National Curriculum.
 Health authorities spend over 25 million pounds a year on treatment and
rehabilitation services for drug misusers."
<P>
Since the mid 1980s, the Government has pursued action to tackle drug misuse
on five main fronts:
<UL>
<LI>international cooperation 
<LI>enforcement 
<LI>deterrence
<LI>prevention 
<LI>treatment 
</UL>
However, the numbers of young people experimenting
with drugs, notified addicts and drug offenders have increased in recent
years.
<P>
The Government proposes to introduce a new strategy for the period 1995-98,
which, while fully maintaining the emphasis on law enforcement and reducing
supply, recognizes the need for stronger action on reducing the demand for
illegal drugs.
The new strategy will emphasize three areas: crime, young people, and public
health. 
Vigorous law enforcement and a new emphasis on education and prevention will
be the focus. The principal objective of treatment policies will be to assist
drug misusers to achieve and maintain a drug free state. 
<P>
<STRONG>In The Netherlands:</STRONG> In 1973 the Dutch National Board of Drug Prevention
formed in
response to a trend in Dutch governmental circles to trivialize the harm of
Cannabis.  The policy of tolerance started officially with the amended Opium
Law in 1976, mitigating the penal consequences of the possession of Cannabis
products.  
<P>
A policy of increasing tolerance was started. There followed an enormous
increase in the use of cannabis, especially among young people. From 1983 to
1992 cannabis use among pupils increased by 250%.  Coffee shops, where
Cannabis is sold openly, now number some 1500 to 2000.      
<P>
The situation in the Netherlands reveals that, by a tolerated possession of
cannabis for private usage and the absence of judicial prosecution of their
sale, the number of abusers will grow steadily.  Though the number of
coffee shops is still increasing and the population is becoming more and more
critical, the Dutch government keeps telling the world that everybody should
follow their beautiful example!  The "responsible use" of drugs does not
exist.  Drugs destroy. And things that destroy must never be made legal.  If
we allow drugs to be legalized, nothing will stem the progress of evil. 
<P>
<STRONG>In Sweden:</STRONG> Sweden has a restrictive drug policy, but this has not always been
the case. In the mid-1950s, the number of drug abusers in Sweden was
estimated at 100.  A few years into the 1960s, the figure ran into thousands.
 Police action alone could 
not stem the tide of drug abuse.  And a liberalisation of drug policy
followed.  To limit the harmful effects of drugs to the user and to help
reduce crime, in 1965 drugs were legally prescribed to addicts and treatment
was offered. However, the addicts supplied their friends with free drugs and
crime increased.  The project was curtailed in 1967.
<P>
In 1965, drug abuse developed into a major social problem, simultaneously
with a rapid growth of juvenile cannabis abuse. There followed a series of
restrictive drug policies and laws.  During the 1970s drug policy was
intensely debated, and a permissive drug policy was again instituted.  In the
mid-1970s, the advent of heroin among drug abusers resulted in a more
restrictive drug policy.  From about 1980 onwards, drug use declined
noticeably among young persons, and continues its decline today.  
<P>
Today, drug prevention measures have high priority within the police, the
customs service, the public prosecution service, the prison and probation
service, social services, schools and various leisure activities.    
<P>
Experimental use of cannabis and other drugs is very low in Sweden, and for
many years drug use among young people has been very limited.  Our aim is a
society in which drug abuse remains a socially unaccepted form of behaviour,
a society in which drug abuse remains a marginal phenomenon.  The essential
prerequisite of a successful drug policy is for people of all ages to
dissociate themselves from drugs and drug abuse.
<P>
<STRONG>In Switzerland: </STRONG>Federal Law regulates the medical use of narcotic substances
and
prohibits all production, trafficking, possession and consumption of drugs
for non-medical purposes.  Opium, heroine, hallucinogens and cannabis are
explicitly banned for all purposes and may only be used for scientific
research.  However, the pro legalization lobby is attempting to circumvent
the law through a well organized network and an intensive media strategy. 
<P>
In 1985 needle exchange programs were initiated. In 1989, Needle Park opened
in Zurich, allowing addicts free rein in a specified location under official
surveillance.  About 300 syringes were distributed daily.  By September 1991
the number of syringes distributed in Needle Park had increased to 12,000 to
15,000 per day.  In 1992, squads of police were sent to close down the park.
Dealers and addicts simply moved about a mile away to Letten, a deserted
train station, where more than 1,000 addicts and dealers gathered daily and
stupefied addicts lay slumped on a carpet of blood-spattered syringes, cotton
swabs and refuse, while others bought and sold cocktails of drugs. 
<P>
After a string of murders and violence, Zurich closed Letten Station in
February 1995.  The experiment in "harm reduction" had grown into a grotesque
sordid spectacle and public menace that bore no resemblance to the clinical,
carefully supervised venture promised by those who led the campaign in its
favor in 1988. 
<P>
In 1987 a well-structured methadone program was liberalized.  There were 300
methadone addicts in the Canton of Zurich before 1987, and more than 2,000 in
1991, according to police.  
<P>
In 1991, the Federal Government decided to intensify its commitment in this
field.  The Swiss Government pursues a four-pronged strategy to prevent the
individually and socially damaging effects of drug misuse:
<UL>
<LI>Criminal prosecution of illicit production, trafficking, possession and
consumption of all legally defined substances. 
<LI>Financially support to cantonal and private projects aimed at prevention.
<LI>Support to cantonal and private projects for a variety of treatment and
reintegration programmes for drug addicts.  It has authorized and is supporting scientific studies of medically prescribed narcotics to destitute drug addicts.
<LI>Support of "harm reduction" measures to enable the immediate survival of
the drug addicts and also to prevent the spreading of HIV, such as needle
distribution.
</UL> 
<P>
A National People's Referendum for a "Youth Without Drugs," has been
sponsored by Jugend ohne Drogen in support of abstinence oriented drug policy
in the Federal Constitution. In June, 1995 on the occasion of the United
Nations Day Against Drug Abuse and Trafficking (June 26th) a Resolution was
addressed to the Swiss Federal Government by VPM Verein Zur Forderung Der
Psychologiscen Menschenkenntnis calling for abstinence oriented and
restrictive drug policy.
<P>
<STRONG>In the United States :</STRONG> Throughout the 1970's, marijuana was decriminalized in
11 states; drug addicts were viewed as victims; and cocaine decriminalization
was proposed.  The largest increase of youth using drugs in the history of
the U.S. followed this permissive attitude. Crime and drug-related social
problems threatened the health and well being of all citizens.
<P>
In the early 1980's the public and law enforcement applied pressure to hold
drug users accountable for their illegal drug use and their role in
facilitating the illegal drug trade.  And drug use was reduced by over 50%.
<P>
Drug legalization advocates initiated a sophisticated public relations
campaign aimed at weakening thepublic's aversion towards illegal drug use.
Drug user lobbyists and organizations and other drug apologists assailed user
accountability measures as infringement of one's "personal right" to use
drugs, exaggerated the cost of user accountability policies, and ignored the
benefit of 12.6 million fewer drug users.
<P>
In the early 1990s, the drug issue began to lose national focus, and thus
momentum.  Once again, anti-drug messages and social attitudes started to
soften, the media and music began to reglamorize drug use, and drug use among
school children began to climb (teen marijuana use doubling over a three year
span), after a 12 year decline.
<P>
<STRONG> Rationale:</STRONG>
<P>
Drug use is not a victimless crime. Drug users place non-drug-users at risk
and cause
considerable societal harm. Drug users harass and disrupt the public peace,
commit crimes under the influence of drugs, cause accidents, and create
unhealthy conditions.  They destroy families and take rights and freedom from
law abiding citizens.
<P>
Recreational drug users, as well as hard core users, are the foundation of
the international drug cartel trade and the source of funds for drug kingpins
and terrorists. The drug trade exists solely because drug users keep it
alive. Drug users who are not yet addicted are perhaps the most culpable for
their drug use.
<P>
Holding drug users accountable early in their drug use pattern can prevent
abuse and addiction problems. For those already addicted, swift and certain
negative consequences for drug use can modify drug use behavior and lead to
recovery through treatment or individual initiative. 
<P>
Research clearly indicates that social norms and user accountability laws are
key factors in preventing drug use and decreasing problem behavior.  In the
justice system, user accountability need not rely on lengthy prison
incarceration, but on a broad continuum of responses such as community
service, asset forfeiture, tough mandatory fines, civil liabilities for all
damages, drug abstinence enforced through frequent drug testing of offenders
with immediate, progressive consequences, loss of federal and state benefits,
loss of driving and other license privileges, automobile impoundment, and
restitution payments. 
<P>
In the workplace, programs must protect employers and non-drug using
employees. 
Workplaces should communicate clear rules and consequences.  In the
community, schools, and homes clear anti-drug norms and values must be stated
and applied.  Tough, but fair, user accountability sanctions should be
enacted.
<P>
Drug user accountability should be a cornerstone of drug strategy. Directing
policies, funding, and energies towards effectively reducing the demand for
drugs is true compassion for the drug user and is in the best interest of
society.
<P>
<STRONG>U.S. EXPERIENCE:</STRONG>
<P>
Throughout the 1970's, United States drug policy exhibited tolerance for drug
users and focused enforcement on heroin traffickers.  Marijuana was
decriminalized in 11 states; drug addicts were viewed as victims; and cocaine
decriminalization was proposed. The largest increase of youth using drugs in
the history of the U.S. and perhaps in the world followed this permissive
attitude by government and society.
<P>
In 1979, approximately 24 million Americans had tried an illicit drug, and
one in ten high school seniors was using marijuana every day of the week.
Drug incarceration rates reached an all time low and crime and drug-related
social problems threatened the health and well being of all citizens.
<P>
In the early 1980's, non-drug users became acutely aware of the negative
impact that drug use was having on their families and communities. The public
and law enforcement applied pressure to hold drug users accountable for their
illegal drug use and their role in facilitating the illegal drug trade after
a decade of lenient drug policy.  
<P>
Zero tolerance of drug use led to a dramatic shift in attitudes and to major
declines in drug use.  In 1992, a child was half as likely to use illegal
drugs as his or her counterpart from 15 years previous, and adults were even
less likely to use. Social intolerance to drug use resulted in 12.6 million
fewer Americans using drugs. Drug user accountability had been applied by law
enforcement, schools, families, workplaces, and the media.
<P>
Drug legalization advocates initiated a sophisticated public relations
campaign aimed at weakening the public's aversion towards illegal drug use.
Drug user lobbyists and organizations and other drug apologists assailed user
accountability measures as infringement of one's "personal right" to use
drugs, exaggerated the cost of user accountability policies, and ignored the
benefit of 12.6 million fewer drug users.
<P>
In the early 1990s, the drug issue began to lose national focus, and thus
momentum.  Once again, anti-drug messages and social attitudes started to
soften, the media and music began to reglamorize drug use, and drug use among
school children began to climb (teen marijuana use doubling over a three year
span), after a 12 year decline.
