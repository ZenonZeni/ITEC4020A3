questions can be a challenge.                                            
Questions about legalization often

<font size="2">           <b>DEA Statement</b>                         <b>The Facts</b>               

DEA is unequivocally opposed to     As the DEA itself points out later   
the legalization of illicit drugs.  in their book, there is no clear     
                                    definition of &quot;legalization&quot; but,    
                                    whatever it is, they are against     
                                    it.                                  
                                                                         
                                    Actually, &quot;legalization&quot; is not the  
                                    issue, because we really don't know  
                                    if we will ever do it.  The issue    
                                    is really whether we need serious    
                                    reform of the current policy, no     
                                    matter what that reform may be       
                                    called.  It would be more accurate   
                                    to state that the DEA is             
                                    unequivocally opposed to any reform  
                                    at all.                              

Legalization in any form would      Whether a drug is perceived as       
likely:                             having risks and costs is not a      
                                    product of the law, but of public

                                    this still would not be a good       
                                    justification to throw individual    
                                    drug users in prison.                

(2) increase availability of and    It should first be pointed out that  
access to harmful drugs;            the DEA itself admits that it has    
(3) increase demand, use, abuse     never had a major impact on          
and addiction; and                  availability of drugs in the United  
                                    States and there is no hope that it  
                                    ever will.  In point of fact, this   
                                    policy often makes the illegal       
                                    drugs more available to              
                                    schoolchildren than alcohol is.      
                                    The availability of alcohol to       
                                    children was one of the major        
                                    reasons that alcohol Prohibition     
                                    was repealed.                        
                                                                         
                                    Whether availability, demand, use,   
                                    abuse and addiction would increase   
                                    depends upon what you mean by        
                                    &quot;legalization&quot;.  If you mean that    
                                    there would be cocaine vending       
                                    machines alongside the tobacco       
                                    vending machines, and convenience    
                                    store clerks would wink as they      
                                    sold heroin to children in the same  
                                    way that they wink when they sell    
                                    tobacco, then drug use might         
                                    increase.   If the drug laws are     
                                    somewhat more sensible, there is     
                                    good evidence to believe that drug   
                                    use would drop.                      

(4) remove the social sanction      There are many ways to have social   
against drug abuse that is          sanctions reinforced in legislation  
reinforced in legislation.          and everyone would agree that some   
                                    laws are necessary to achieve best   
                                    results with the drug problem.  The  
                                    question is whether it does any      
                                    good to enforce those social         
                                    sanctions with prison.  All the      
                                    evidence says that prison does more  
                                    harm than good.                      

The present social problems in the  The Drug War benefits only two

                                    to the situation.

We hope the Guide will be used in                                        
several ways. For local law                                              
enforcement executives, community                                        
leaders, prevention advocates and                                        
others, the Guide should serve,                                          
first, as an open invitation to                                          
join in making the affirmative                                           
case against legalization. Second,                                       
it provides background and                                               
practical answers to the most                                            
commonly asked questions about the                                       
legalization of drugs.

There are a few things to remember  This is no surprise.  There has      
when discussing the legalization    been a concerted media campaign to   
issue.                              instil this belief in the American   
                                    public over the last several

Second, when discussing             Strangely enough, information is     
legalization, it is important that  the one thing that all drug          
all available information and       warriors seem to be short on in
