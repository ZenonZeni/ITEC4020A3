Does <i>your</i> child have a problem?<br>
Perhaps we can help</p>

<hr width="75%">

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="1">Who has learning disabilities?</a></h2>

<p>Your chances of knowing him are very good: people like him may make up
at least 10% of the population, cutting across every segment of the
population. Can we afford the loss of the talents and contributions of
this proportion of the population? Of even one person?

<p>This is the bright little boy who started first grade expecting to
learn to read, but he didn't. <b>He couldn't. He has one kind of learning
disability.</b> His very serious problem is dyslexia - impairment of the
ability to read - which can damage his performance in every other
academic area. Fortunately, there is hope. He can be taught to
compensate. He can reach his potential, if only someone will understand
and do something.

<p>Through no fault of his own, a child like this is handicapped. He
needs special help, but because his handicap cannot be seen, he often
does not receive assistance. The pressure on him to perform like other
normal children is tremendous. He wants to understand and tries to, but
he fails. He cannot solve his perplexing problem: that takes a trained
professional. It is urgent to get that professional and this child
together, before the child gives up.

<p>Once the problem has been identified, remediation has begun and
compensation is implemented in the classroom, the person can begin to
help himself to rebuild his fading self esteem.

<h4>How to identify a person with learning disabilities:</h4>

<blockquote>
<b>Any unexplained, persistent problem in learning a basic skill
necessary for survival as an independent adult may be a clue to learning
disabilities in a person of normal to superior intelligence.</b>
</blockquote>

<p>Learning disabilities should be considered as a possible cause if a
child has trouble with one or more of the following:
<ul>
  <li>thinking clearly
  <li>writing legibly
  <li>spelling accurately
  <li>learning to read
  <li>learning to compute
  <li>copying forms
  <li>remembering facts
  <li>following directions
  <li>putting things in sequence
</ul>

<p>or, if he is often confused, clumsy, impulsive, hyperactive, or
disoriented, becoming frustrated and rebellious, depressed, withdrawn, or
aggressive.

<p><b>A learning disability (LD)</b> is  a lifelong disorder which
affects the manner in which individuals with normal or above average
intelligence select, retain, and express information.  Incoming or
outgoing information may become scrambled as it travels
between the senses and the brain.

<p>In adults, learning disabilities are commonly recognized as deficits
in one or more of the following academic areas: 

<ul>
  <li>comprehension
  <li>spelling
  <li>written expression
  <li>problem solving
  <li>math computation
</ul>

<p>Less frequent, but no less troublesome, are problems in organizational
skill, time management, and social skills. Many adults with learning
disabilities may also have language based and/or perceptual processing problems.

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="3">Educating Persons  with Learning Disabilities</a></h2>

<h3>How much does it cost to educate a person with learning
disabilities?</h3>

<p>It costs very little compared to the cost of <b><i>not</i></b>
educating him. In every community offering appropriate services, examples
of successful remediation can be found, some in college and some in the
adult world.  

<p><b>The Schools</b><br> 
Public schools are required by law to provide persons with learning
disabilities with a free, appropriate education. Good school systems are
working in compliance with the law. Good professionals are dedicated to
careful diagnosis and quality remediation. Programs and services for
persons with learning disabilities are mandated through high school age and beyond, and should be available. 

<p><b>Finding the Right Educational Program </b>
<ul>
<li>Become involved in your child's school program. Meet with the
classroom teacher and request a student study team meeting.  Write a
letter to the school principal stating that your child may have a
specific learning disability, and requesting a comprehensive evaluation,
to be followed by an Individualized Educational Program (IEP) meeting.
<b>Keep copies of all correspondence with the school and a record of the
dates and contents of all telephone conversations.</b> You legally have
access to your child's file at the school and may request copies of his
records.<br>

<li>Contact a local LDA chapter, state office, or the national office for
specific learning disabilities and procedural information.<br>

<li>Pinpoint the problem. Arrange for a thorough physical evaluation,
including vision and hearing. Consider the need for assessment of
receptive and/or expressive language problems, and visual perception
difficulties.
</ul>

<p><b>Parent Advocates</b><br> 
Local LDA chapters usually have experienced volunteers who know the
special education laws, professional language, appropriate tests for
specific learning disabilities, the types of special education programs,
and the schools and school systems. Individuals like these are ready to
serve as resource persons and can provide information to parents about
advocacy resources.

<h3>The high school, college, and vocational student with learning
disabilities</h3>

<p>The student with learning disabilities may require a variety of
services which can include: tutorial services, special academic
advisement, basic skill remediation, assistance in organization and
development of adequate study skills, and additional program
accommodation, or modification. Some students with learning disabilities
may not require extensive use of personnel, extra funds, or assistance
from professors, but may need appropriate program modifications and use
of auxiliary aids. These include readers, scribes, note takers, extended
time policies for assigned papers, projects, or tests, and taped books or
lectures. 

<p>However, it must be noted that these services are designed to
<b>equalize</b> opportunities, not to lower the academic standards for
these students or to alter the essential nature of the degree
requirements. There are, however, instances where a student is unable to
master a particular course because of his disability. In those cases,
course substitutions may be in order if the course in question is not
essential to the degree program or related to a licensing requirement.

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="4">Through A Child’s Eyes</a></h2>

<h3><i>A candid look at</i><br>A Family of Children with Learning
Disabilities</H3>

<p><i>Twelve year old Bobby would be glad to write or tell this true
story if he could, but the words wouldn't come out right for him even if
he tried. Let's look at this frankly through his eyes, though:</i>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm in the sixth grade now and am doing O.K., I think. I'm the lucky
one of the family for two of my three older brothers had a pretty rough
time in school. I'd like to talk about me first. I can remember when I
was little I used to say to my folks, "I hear you but I don't understand
you." Even now, I have to listen "hard" in school and at home I just plain
don't "dig" the T.V. stories sometimes. It's kind of funny though as my
oldest brother who is twenty eight often has to ask his wife what happened 
on the T.V. show even yet. When I hear him still ask questions I don't
feel so dumb because I know he isn't dumb.

<p>My mother tells me I am really doing great now in what I think of
"Me".  I used to always say "I'm stupid." Seems like I just couldn't get
 along with the kids either. They used to call me dumb lots of times. I
could get along with grown-ups a lot easier, now I'm doing better with
the kids since I'm older.

<p>I do O.K. with my teachers. They know I really try. I can 
still remember way back in the first grade when I used to "scrub"
my pencil across the paper. Sometimes I did it all day; I just couldn't 
do anything the other kids did and that really made me mad. I couldn't 
read either.

<p>In the second grade I started getting lots of extra help. 
I began to find I really could learn but it just took a lot longer 
for me. I had a very special kind of help in reading. I have trouble 
even yet, but I'm coming along slowly. My twenty-one year old brother 
still has lots of problems with reading and spelling, yet he is really 
sharp in lots of ways. He understands everything very quickly that 
he hears; he's just a lot better "listener" than I am.

<p>My writing is something else. I asked my teacher one day 
whether she wanted me to write fast and sloppy or slow and neat. She 
is great though as she told me to just do the best I can. I took private 
typing lessons all last year and that has really helped me out in 
my school work.

<p>I do try hard and when I have a nice teacher like I have 
now, somehow I seem to plug right along. I still need lots of help 
at home though. I can read better now but I just can't keep up with 
the books in my grade. All my books except math and grammar are on 
tapes. My mother is a special teacher, herself, and has helped me 
all these years. If we ever get so we can't work together we agreed 
we'd find someone else to help me.

<p>We are an unusual family. Even though three of us four 
boys have problems in learning, all my older brothers are making it 
OK in college. Some of them started kind of late, but they are still 
at it.

<p>They do one of the things I'm doing already, like listening to books
on tapes. Of course I'm one ahead of them since I can type already. One
of my brothers has some pretty girl in his college class taking notes for
him on what is said in class for he spells so bad he can't read his own
notes. Then in the subjects that he has a lot of reading to do, my mother types out notes for him to study. All my brothers use the tape recorder in their classes sometimes, but they say it takes so long to listen to the
tapes again that they sometimes run out of time. I'll probably do that
when I get older,but right now I don't want to as I'm afraid the kids
will tease me. I don't like to be too different than the other kids.

<p>Little by little I'm beginning to think "I'm OK" and I already know my
brothers are "OK". We just laugh like when one of my brothers puts the new
house numbers on in the wrong order. Another brother turns the valves on
our swimming pool the wrong direction. Then my oldest brother gets lost a
lot when he is driving someplace. He acts just like my mother does behind
the wheel. We kid a lot about the funny things we do sometimes. It helps
me to laugh at my own goofs. We are all sort of like fish in the water,
but you should see us on dry land. Football, basketball, tennis  --  you
name it -- they just aren't our bag. Our family sort of pulls together; I
guess that is the main thing.

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="5">Parent’s Creed</a></h2>

<p><b>THE PARENTS</b><br>
They told them she would <B><i>"grow out of it"</i></B> so they waited
another year.

<p>Baffled by their problems, parents seek advice but often in the wrong
places. Even if they have raised other children who were academically
successful and even if they are convinced that parents are
<b><i>experts</i></b> in knowing their own children, 
their self confidence vanishes. They feel helpless as they suffer with,
for, or because of these youngsters.

<p>Another year of failure goes by, leaving its scars on a sensitive
mind.

<p><b>Identification... from infancy to adulthood.</b><br>
From infancy, parents should be checking the child's progress against the
norms for his age group, using any good reference on child development. If there are continuing deviations, 
they should discuss them with a trusted professional. Most school
districts have pre primary diagnostic clinics and special education programs, if needed. Early remediation is best, but 
later is better than none -- even much later. LDA can provide information
for adults with learning disabilities.

<p><b>Not one person of normal intelligence should be sent into today's
job market without basic academic survival skills.</b>

<p>Yesterday's person with a learning disability entered a simpler adult
society, often at a younger age. Some who were unusually gifted and
talented became famous:

</CENTER>

<p>We do not hear about the rest, whose talents and intelligence may have
been lost to the world, but who could nevertheless make a living with
their hands.

<p>Today's person with learning disabilities enters a highly lingual,
educated society. Credentials that he may not be able to obtain stop him
at the threshold of the career of his choice, and his second choice, and
on down the line. How many are we losing, and what will happen to them in
an increasingly technological job market?

<p ALIGN=CENTER><b>A PARENT'S CREED</b><br><font size=-1>(written by an
LDA mother)</font>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>I BELIEVE</b> that being the parent of a child with a hidden
handicap is the most important and challenging job I will ever have. In
the few years I have to help him mature, I will always attempt to instill
in him a deep knowledge of his innate worth as an individual and never
measure his behavior or scholastic achievement by any other child.

<p><b>I WILL</b> strive to always remember that this child is operating
under great pressure and much frustration; therefore, I will not reject
his outbursts as being abnormal or unrestrained misbehavior. I will
recall the many times he has been loving and kind and try to overlook the incidences when there is overt hostility. And then I will try to help structure his world so that frustrations might be lessened and he will feel more secure.

<p><b>I WILL</b> have endless patience when directions are not followed
at the first command, and when some rule or concept is forgotten or
misunderstood.  I will not expect perfection. I will be aware of and
grateful for every small improvement he makes.

<p><b>THROUGH</b> the trials which I may face each day, I will always
remember that this child did not choose to be different and that he would, if possible, gladly be “normal”.  However, since he is different, he deserves special understanding, patience,
acceptance, and love. He's my child, and it is my right and my duty to
guide him in finding fulfillment in life.

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="6">Compensatory Techniques and Curriculum
Adaptations</a></h2>

<p>While the majority of the student's program should be as closely
aligned with the school and classroom core curriculum, some modifications
and accommodations might be necessary.  Listed below are some suggested
compensatory techniques, curriculum adaptations, and educational aids for
students with specific learning disabilities (SLD):

<ol>
<li>For students with difficulty reading, or the very slow reader, the
"read along technique" with taped textbooks and workbooks might be used in
the classroom,  at home, and in the resource room. <br>

<li>For students with memory problems, or unable to take notes in
classroom, a fellow student might share notes by using carbon paper, or
the teacher could provide a copy of the class lesson or allow the student
to tape record lessons. <br>

<li>Educational film strips and videos are available on most subjects and
most grade levels for general information not acquired from the printed
page. Talking books may be acquired from the library. <br>

<li>For students with short term memory problems -- i.e., do not remember
mathematical facts, but understand the computation process -- a table of
math facts and other visual aids, and a <b>printing</b> calculator could
be provided. <br>

<li>For the student who has difficulty writing, a battery cassette
recorder could be provided for the student to dictate answers to tests or
written lessons. <br>

<li>For the student who cannot write legibly, reverses letters, numbers
or symbols  (e.g., <b>+</b> for <b>x</b>), typing could be taught as
early as possible. Each typing lesson is also a lesson in punctuation,
spelling and vocabulary. <br>

<li>Handouts should be typed, not handwritten. Some students may benefit
from large print, or colored plastic overlays thought by some to enhance
symbols and to give depth to printed page. <br>

<li>To train memory and listening skills, the use of poetry, rhymes,
songs, and spelling tapes, beginning with the early grades, is thought to
be helpful. <br>

<li>Teaching spelling  should be started with a multisensory approach --
say the word, spell the word orally, then write the word. <br>

<li><b>Reading:</b> Test the student for ability to learn and use
phonics. Students who can't profit from phonics might be taught by
alternate methods. A need for individual evaluation is indicated. The
teacher should explore different methods until a technique is found that
benefits the student. Assessment should be made for instructional level
as well as comprehension level. In some cases the use of high interest
materials, a couple of grades below the student's grade level, may be
beneficial. Concrete words such as nouns, verbs and certain adjectives
and adverbs might be taught with flash cards -- both the word and
illustration of the word. Abstract words that cannot be illustrated
(e.g., <i>of, is, if, to,</i> etc.) could be taught as part of a phrase
or sentence on flash cards. These abstract words should be
<b>highlighted</b> in the  textbook. <br>

<li>Vocabulary enrichment of content material:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The student can prepare files of vocabulary words 
  used in a story or textbook, add definitions, write new sentences 
  using the words, and keep them in alphabetical order.  

  <P>Large print-picture dictionaries are available for 
  different reading levels. "Concept Picto-Cards" are an excellent 
  tool for vocabulary, spelling and reading comprehension.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Supplemental educational materials include
<ul>
<p>Large type copies of <B><I>Readers Digest</i></b> magazine 
and Condensed Books (many  are already on tape  -- e.g., "Talking 
Tapes"). 

<p>Picture magazines: <B><I>Life, People</i></b>, etc.  

<p>Maps in dark outline, color coded, large lettering. <br><br>
</ul>

<li><b>Writing:</b> For problems in copying, worksheets which leave space
under each word, phrase or sentence for copying provide support for
additional practice. Put list of words on right margin for left handed
students, or those with mixed  dominance (switch hitters). Have hand outs
at desk for those who can't copy from blackboard or take dictation.  For
students who use <b>large</b> written symbols, enlarge space allowed for
"fill in the blank" tests or work sheets. <br>

<li>For students who have difficulty with processing auditory input,
(fully understanding questions asked, recalling or forming an appropriate
answer), be patient -- wait for the answer or present the question in
written form. <br>

<li>Oral language should be taught simultaneously with written language.
Illustrations in the reading book should be used to generate conversation
that duplicates what is to be read in the printed text. Television
viewing at home could serve the same purpose. <br>

<li>Use video tapes to supplement instruction in subject matter (e.g.,
reading, social studies, science, mathematics). Computers, captioned TV
programs, video tapes and workbooks used in preparing for GED testdirs
are the newest and most effective ways to supplement instruction for
students with <b>specific learning disabilities</b> (SLD).<br>

<li>A multidisciplinary team is essential for proper evaluation of SLD. A
multisensory approach is needed to make classroom instruction meaningful
and available.

<h3>Teaching Mathematics to Students with Learning Disabilities</h3>

<p>Learning disabilities in mathematics have received relatively little
attention, yet the learning of mathematics is viewed as a crucial part 
of one's education -- mathematical abilities are listed as a separate 
category in the generic term "learning disabilities" by the 
National Joint Committee for Learning Disabilities and by Public Law 
94-142 (listening, speaking, reading, writing, <b>mathematical abilities</b>,
reasoning).

<p>Theories on mathematics disabilities view spatial visualization and 
verbal skills as critical. These two categories have a great deal to do
with anyone learning mathematics and are merely magnified for students 
with learning disabilities. These two areas should receive much attention 
in one's mathematics education and should be heavily emphasized in the 
teaching and remediation of mathematical concepts and skills. Concepts 
should be introduced with "hands on" concrete materials. Calculations 
should be done with calculators if memory is a problem (skill in using 
a calculator is necessary). Estimation strategies should be taught as 
mental computational skills are developed. Students should draw 
illustrations and representations whenever possible. Students should 
consistently discuss, read, and write mathematics. 

<p>Knowing one digit facts is important, but work with paper and pencil 
algorithms should not be emphasized. An individual educational program 
in mathematics should concentrate on developing concepts and skills 
within these strands: numeration, geometry, measurement, collecting and 
interpreting data, estimation/mental computation, patterns and relations, 
word problems/applications. For some students with learning disabilities,
the focus of the requirements should be on "hands on" and practical and 
daily living experiences, writing and discussing applications of mathematics.
