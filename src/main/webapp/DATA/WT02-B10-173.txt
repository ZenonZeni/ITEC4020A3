is Co-Investigator. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
It has been claimed that left-handedness reduces life expectancy by nine years! Handedness and mortality were examined in a cohort of 9,043 male twins, all World War II veterans. Preliminary data relating direction and strength of handedness to crude death rate showed a mortality peak for weak right-handers rather than strong sinistrals, laying to rest an already shaky claim that had terrified the left-handed community. We now pursue our finding of peak mortality among weak right-handers. A current genetic theory proposes that the "weak dextral" phenotype actually conceals a "weak sinistral" genotype that yielded to the postnatal pressures of a "right-handed world." One implication of our finding is that reduced survival fitness may be the price of compliance with social pressures that violate powerful biological imperatives. We hypothesize (a) that changes in genetically-driven behaviors such as handedness due to social pressures shortens the life span of both singletons and fraternal twins, and, (b) that the known symbiotic relationship between identical twins protects them from such outcomes. Higher death rate in dizygotic than in monozygotic twins was previously reported for cardiovascular disease. This finding has now been confirmed and also applies to cancer deaths.

<B>The Effect on the Infant of Post-partum Depression in the Mother</B>  Dr. Beatrice Beebe is Principal Investigator and Drs. Samuel Anderson and Joseph Jaffe are Co-lnvestigators.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Infants of depressed mothers are at risk for social, emotional, and cognitive difficulty that may outlast the depression. We propose that mother-infant communication can be disturbed by deviant interpersonal timing. A new technology requires only ten minutes of interaction to measure the coordination of vocal timing between mother and infant. Furthermore, the method is completely automated and free of clinical bias. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The technique is now being applied in a pilot study of depressed mothers and their infants, with a matched normal control group. Of the first 50 dyads studied, an important mode of mother-infant communication (simultaneous vocalizing) was less prevalent in depressed than in control dyads. This finding suggests one interpersonal timing mechanism, i.e., absence of coactive vocal contingency, whereby depressed mothers might transmit distress to their infants. Thus, the research contributes to our goal of an objective, automated test for early detection of risk for compromised social development.

Dr. Beebe has also established didactic links to the Residency Program and the Psychoanalytic Clinic.
