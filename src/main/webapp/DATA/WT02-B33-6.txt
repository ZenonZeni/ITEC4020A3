BLIZZARD OF '96 WREAKS HAVOC; WILL COST INDUSTRY MILLIONS

      The blizzard on the East Coast brought most air freight
operations to a standstill for parts of last week. Airport closures
from North Carolina to Maine had a ripple effect on air travel
throughout the country, forcing countless cancellations and delays. 
      United Parcel Service, which operates regional sort hubs in
Newark and Philadelphia, trucked all air packages to open airports
and diverted flights to its Louisville, Ky. headquarters, says UPS
spokesperson Ken Sternad. "We had a lot of contingency plans to
keep things moving and made alternative arrangements where customers
could pick up packages at our facilities or had drivers walking in
some areas." 
      The storm is going to cost UPS millions of dollars, mostly in
added operational costs such as overtime, rerouting of flights and
using a less efficient distribution system, he says.  
      "[Jan. 8] will go down as a day of infamy," says FedEx
spokesperson Bill Carroll. "Our whole East Coast operation pretty
much came to a stop because all major airports were closed. We have
dealt with a lot of ice, hurricanes and earthquakes, but we have
never been hit this hard in such a large area. Usually disasters
are confined to a fairly small geographic area and don't have such
a far reaching impact," he says.
      Airborne Express couriers made deliveries on foot in New York
City early last week, but did not face the pickup and delivery
obstacles of FedEx and UPS because the company focuses on primarily
business accounts, says Airborne spokesperson Scott Hopper. "The
downtown business areas were cleared first so we were able to reach
customers," he says. "We had planes on the ground on the West Coast
and other warmer cities, but by Wednesday we were making about 60%
of our deliveries." 
      DHL sent its drivers out to make deliveries in New York City
via the subway on Jan. 9 until the driving restrictions were
lifted, says DHL spokesperson David Fonkalsrud. 
      TNT Express Worldwide rerouted all international shipments
from JFK International Airport to Miami International until JFK
services resumed on Jan. 10.
      "We faced the obvious problems of finding lift to the Far
East due to flight cancellations," says Michael Tomasulo, Air
Express International director of airline gateways, North America.
"Our commercial customers understand what we were up against and
carriers were very good about honoring our lift allocations." AEI
was still struggling with backlog from a very heavy December when
the storm hit, but says operations were back to normal by the
middle of last week.

FAA RETRACTS FREIGHTER CONVERSION KIT CERTIFICATION, ISSUES AD 

      The Federal Aviation Administration retracted a previously
approved modification kit which converts a passenger Boeing 747 aircraft
into a freighter. The airworthiness directive, issued Jan. 3, impacts 10
Boeing 747-100s and -200s operated by four carriers, all converted by
San Francisco-based GATX Airlog. The AD, citing defective main deck
floors and inadequately constructed doors, requires the carriers to
modify the aircraft to meet the revised FAA standards by Jan. 30 or be
forced to halve the payload now carried by the aircraft. The four
airlines affected by the AD -- Evergreen Airlines, Tower Air, American
International Airways and Polar Air -- all have plans to modify the
aircraft to meet the revised standards before the end of the month and
have the aircraft back in service carrying full payloads of cargo. The
new weight limitations would reduce the 747's payload from 
220,000 pounds to 120,000 pounds, making the aircraft nearly
impossible to operate economically.
      The issue of the 747 cargo door is not new. GATX and the
airlines have been engaged in dialogue  with the FAA for more than
a year. 
    "This has taken on a life bigger than most ADs, even more than
those of a more serious nature," says Rick Hatton, president of
GATX Airlog. "The need to make some corrections along the way is
like any other AD. The fact the FAA continues to hammer the safety
points is unfounded, but it's their prerogative and has nothing to
do with structure," he adds. "In fact, the incidents all validate
the strength of the structure." 
    "Our analysis failed to show that all of the points around the
door meet 150% of the required FAA standard. We don't think it's a
safety-related issue, but it was easier to fix it than to fight
it." 
    GATX Airlog, whose only business is modifying 747s to
freighters, received FAA approval to begin modifications in 1988.
The firm is finishing its 23rd of the type this month. 
    GATX is supplying the four carriers with the materials to make
the modifications and procedures for the aircraft. Once all aircraft
modifications are complete, Hatton says, the FAA will most likely
terminate the AD before it takes effect. 
    American International Airways expects its two 747-100s to be
down for about 10 days to undergo the modification beginning Jan.
10, says Bill Gray, AIA vice president and general manager. "For
us, the first quarter is always slower so this is the time to do
the modification," he says. Gray qualified the modification as "the
cost of doing business," adding he expects the modifications to cost
between $150,000 and $200,000, not including loss of business. 
    Tower Air anticipates the modification to take four days and it
is scheduled to be completed by its own maintenance staff by the
end of the month.  
    Polar Air is making the changes during its routine maintenance
which had already been scheduled for this month for the two
affected aircraft, says Polar Air spokesperson Catherine West. The
airline plans for both aircraft to be fixed and approved by the end
of January. "Although, there is any real proof of the problems,
there is enough of a risk that the carriers want to take care of
it," she adds.
    Calls to Evergreen were not returned at press time.

FOUR INFLIGHT INCIDENTS ON RECORD 

    Operators of the 10 affected aircraft have reported four
inflight incidents that have resulted in substantial structural
damage. GATX and the carriers maintain that the incidents have
nothing to do with the way the aircraft was modified. The incident
reports include: a 3.0g dive maneuver, which was successfully
recovered by the pilot; a total engine separation due to departure
into known turbulence; an uncontained engine failure which resulted
in wing and fuselage damage; and a severe landing that resulted in
a 40-foot by 3-foot hole in the fuselage. 
    The FAA is accepting responsibility for the matter, saying it
issued the certification in error and has since streamlined its
certification process for cargo equipment, moving the process to its
Northwest regional office. 
    The FAA found that a payload reduction was the only way to make
the aircraft safe under adverse conditions. It intends to
investigate other types of loading conditions to determine whether
additional operational limitations must be imposed to address the
structural inadequacies of the main deck floor and other areas that
have not yet been identified. Although the action is a final rule,
comments are invited. The deadline is March 4.

FEDEX INDIA PLANS AIR SERVICE, AWARDS CONTRACT FOR CARGO CONVERSIONS

    Blue Dart Express, FedEx's exclusive agent in India, is getting
into the airline business. Already the largest air express company
in India, Blue Dart will be the first carrier to operate jet
freighters in the country. The firm bought two Boeing 737-200s from
Air India for $4 million, which are now being converted into
freighters by Georgia-based Stambaugh Aviation. Air services are
slated to begin in March. 
     Bombay-based Blue Dart, with revenues of $27.7 million in 1995
and expected revenues of more than $40 million this year, was the
first company to be given permission from the Indian government to
operate air cargo services in the country. To date, the company has
acted as FedEx's India agent as well as a domestic courier.    
    "It has always been Blue Dart's vision to set up a domestic
express aviation service with its own fleet of aircraft but this
could only be done when the Indian government deregulated the
aviation industry about three years ago," Diwaker Singh, senior vice
president, marketing and commercial tells ACR. With sites set on
providing a total transportation and logistical solutions for
companies such as GE, Motorola, IBM, Ford and Sony which have
factories in the country, Singh is confident that Blue Dart "will
revolutionize the way that distribution is currently done in the
country." 
    The 737 will carry eight pallets of cargo once the conversion is
complete. Singh is initially targeting door-to-door express cargo
with heavy cargo treated as filler. The long-term objective is very
clear, he says. Blue Dart is positioning itself to be "an
integrated express door-to-door package mover." Blue Dart already
holds a 26% market share in India and Singh only sees that figure
rising. Once air services begin, he predicts revenues increasing by
about 100% by 1997. 
    "The fact that they are adding air service will certainly
improve our domestic network," says FedEx spokesperson Cliff Morley.
"But FedEx service levels will remain the same, unless, of course,
they improve their transit times." 
    Competition in cargo is fierce, but thanks to the sheer size of
the country and often undependable service, Singh sees the chance to
enter the fray as a "great opportunity." To date, the only domestic
air competition Blue Dart faces is from United Parcel Service
affiliate, Elbee Lmt., which currently operates four Fokker F27
turboprops. Singh expects to add a third 737 in about six months
and possibly more, depending on market demand.

AIRBORNE BUYS BOEING 767s; PART OF $600 MILLION AIRCRAFT COMMITMENT

    Airborne Express is buying 12 used Boeing 767-200s, as part of a
$600 million long-term decision to add wide-bodied aircraft to its
growing fleet of 109 planes. Following a year-long study, Airborne
chose the 767 over both the Airbus A300B4 and the McDonnell Douglas
DC-10-10.
    Nine of the 12 will be acquired from Itochu Air Lease Corp.,
with the remaining three from Marubeni Corp. Airborne lists the
purchase price, plus spares and major modification to cargo
configuration, at $290 million.
    Airborne is completing the conversion at its airline hub
facility in Wilmington, Ohio. Airborne, which does not create a side
loading door but loads with special containers through the passenger
door, is able to save a significant amount of money on the
conversions. The first conversion is expected to begin in April and
enter the fleet about seven months later.  
    The 767s will be a net gain of 12 aircraft for Airborne. The
carrier, on some its heavier routes, plans to replace DC-8s with
the 767s where upgrades are merited. The DC-8s will move to new
routes or a second aircraft will be added where certain city pairs
need two flights.   
    Airborne also plans to acquire 10 to 15 more 767-200s in the
next eight years at a total cost of $310 million. The first two
767s will arrive in 1997, followed by four in '98, four in '99 and
two in 2000. The 
move "should decrease operating costs while keeping capital
requirements relatively unchanged," the airline says.
    The 767 has many operating advantages over other aircraft of the
same size, mostly due to newer, fuel-efficient engines and a two-
person crew. Airborne figures its 767s will have a 14% lower direct
operating cost per hour than the DC-8, 17% less than the A300 and
43% less than the DC-10-10.
    Several factors in Airborne's decision were to acquire aircraft
that could serve markets that it is outgrowing with DC-8s, as well
as the ability to fly unrestricted transcontinental payloads at a
utilization rate of at least 12 hours a day. 
    The cargo airline also incorporated environmental factors in its
decision, telling ACR that the 767 has the lowest nitrous oxide
emissions of any candidate aircraft, 17% lower than the A300B4 and
48% less than the DC-10-10.
    Airborne now operates a fleet of 63 DC-9s, 35 DC-8s and 11 YS-
11s. The carrier says it has no plans to retire any aircraft as a
result of the purchase decision, and has been adding eight to 10
DC-9s and DC-8s annually and plans to continue that rate.

FAA, AIRLINES BEGIN TESTING BOMB-RESISTANT CARGO CONTAINERS

    Some of the nations's largest airlines will participate in an
FAA program to test baggage and cargo containers that can withstand
an explosion like the one that downed Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.
    The program, scheduled to begin in June and run through 1997,
will collect cost and performance data so that the FAA can
determine whether to mandate use of the containers, says Ken Hacker,
the agency's aircraft hardening program manager. The $5 million
program will demonstrate the cost to airlines of maintaining the
hardened containers and how well their blast-resistant properties
hold up under repeated use on flights. 
    Unlike current containers, which can still be used after
incurring minor damage from routine handling, hardened containers
will have stricter standards. The operational testing will help the
FAA answer questions from the U.S. Congress about the cost-benefit
tradeoff between explosives detection and aircraft hardening, Hacker
says. Increased blast resistance within an aircraft reduces the need
to detect smaller and smaller amounts of explosives. Research
sponsored by the FAA Technical Center has shown that it is feasible
to contain an explosion within a cargo container. 
    The FAA is considering requiring hardened cargo containers to
hold mail or electronic equipment, or for aircraft that fly in
areas in which a security threat exists. Hardened containers protect
an aircraft's fuselage by absorbing some of the pressure of an
explosion and venting the rest into the cargo compartment or
adjacent containers at a manageable rate. They also weigh more.
    While airlines are interested in enhancing safety, they are
concerned about the cost and extra weight of hardened containers,
says Trans World Airlines spokesman John McDonald.
    But research is being done to develop a hardened container
weighing 250 pounds, says the FAA's Hacker. Aluminum containers now
in use weigh 150 to 250 pounds. Mass-produced hardened containers
are expected to cost $3,000 or more. Aluminum containers cost $1,500
to $2,000.
    Another concern of airlines is the limited applicability of
hardened containers. The prototype containers, which conform to LD-3
cargo container standards, are only used on widebody aircraft. Cargo
moving on narrowbody aircraft is usually not containerized. American
Airlines Cargo  spokesman Ed Martelle pointed out that 68% of his
carrier's fleet are narrowbody aircraft and could not use the
hardened containers.He also worries about terrorists' response to
the use of hardened containers. They likely would turn their efforts
away from international flights, which are served by widebody
aircraft, and target the U.S. and European markets, which are more
likely to be served by narrowbody aircraft, he says.
    The FAA next month will choose several companies to supply 10 to
20 containers for the tests. American Airlines, TWA and Delta Air
Lines will be among the first airlines to use the containers on
scheduled passenger flights in May or June. 
    The prototype containers, which conform to LD-3 cargo container
standards, will be placed on Boeing and McDonnell Douglas widebody
aircraft. Cargo carriers will also be included in the program to
see how different operating conditions affect the containers'
performance.
    Based on the feedback it receives from the participating
airlines, the FAA will ask vendors to modify the containers and may
also select additional manufacturers later this year.

CARGO STOCKS UP 26%, GAIN $1.83 BILLION IN 1995

    The parent corporations of eight cargo carriers surveyed by ACR
picked up an average of 26% in share value during 1995, for a gain
in market value of nearly $2 billion. 
    Fritz Companies, with 17 acquisitions in 1995, was the biggest
proportionate winner, with its common shares rising 77% on the
exchange. Airborne Freight and FedEx also picked up value
significantly, with share gains of more than 20%
    Other increases were more modest, but it was the increase across
the board that best indicates the improved market climate of 1995.
None of the eight publicly-traded companies lost ground.
    The largest absolute increase in shareholder value belonged to
FedEx, which got through a delayed opening of its Philippines hub
and a late-year labor quarrel in decent enough shape to post a
$762-million increase in market worth. Next was Fritz Companies,
much smaller than FedEx, which registered a $455-million gain.
    At yearend, FedEx, Fritz, and Burlington Air Express's parent
Pittston Services Group [PZS] were all worth more than $1 billion
on equity markets. The eight-company group as a whole was worth
$8.89 
billion Dec. 31, or about 30% of the U.S. major passenger airlines'
value.

CARGO NEWS BRIEFS

* United Parcel Service provided all of the transportation needed to
move, Keiko, the whale star of "Free Willy" from Mexico City to
Oregon last week. The transportation, at an estimated cost of
$250,000, included flying Keiko from Mexico to Newport, Ore., on a
C-130, then moving him over-ground in a roller-bed trailer to the
Oregon Coast Aquarium. Newport's runway is less than 6,000 feet, too
short for a Boeing 747, so UPS held on to the C-130 chartered for
late December to carry the whale. The aircraft, carrying a 42,000
pound payload, made two technical stops on the 8.5 hour flight --
one in Monterrey, Mexico and the other in Phoenix for U.S. Customs
clearance. More than 350 media representatives were there to meet
the aircraft, painted in UPS livery for the event.
    UPS will introduce distance-based pricing for its air express
service on Feb. 3. Under the new structure U.S. zip codes are
divided into seven regions and priced according to weight and
distance. Prior to the change, pricing was based on weight only.
Relying less on its Louisville hub and more on its five regional
sort hubs, the company maintains that more efficient sorting will
lead to shorter distances the packages will travel. Rates for
commercial standard ground shipments will increase an average of
2.9%; 3.9% for residential shipments; next day and second day air
4.9% and three-day select 3.9%. International shipments originating
in the U.S. will increase an average of 4.9% and international
express by 6.9%.
 
* Lufthansa Cargo and South African Airways Cargo have been jointly
operating four weekly Boeing 747 freighters since Oct. 1, but
further cooperation is imminent. The two airlines recently signed a
new codesharing pact which will provide more lift between Germany
and South Africa with 29 weekly passenger flights, while stepping up
cooperative efforts in cargo handling and automation. 
 
* Kintetsu World Express has expanded its operations to include
Chile, Colombia, Panama and Peru. KWE Latin America provides door-
to-door service, including forwarding, warehousing and distribution,
inventory control and other logistics services. Kintetsu also was
awarded ISO 9002 certification in its Boston office.

* Air Express International has integrated its LOGIS automation
system into an e-mail address on the Internet. This is the first
step toward a World Wide Web home page, expected to be online later
this quarter. It allows customers without a hard link to AEI to
track shipments and communicate with the company, says AEI
spokesperson Candace Brouchard. 

* Expeditors International selected Transworld M. Mordehay & Sons as
its customs broker and international cargo agent for air and ocean
imports and exports in Israel. 

* ValuJet launched its new counter-to-counter small package service
throughout its 26-city network late last month. ValuJet's Small
Package (VSP) is scanned and barcoded upon check-in and re-scanned
at transfer points and its final destination. All scanned
information is transferred to a help desk at the airline's Atlanta
headquarters. Shipments are restricted to 50 pounds and dimensions
can not exceed a total of 90 inches per piece. Prices start at $29
or 69 cents per pound. 

* Sierra Expressway Airlines introduced a new counter-to-counter
express package service called Expressway Pack. The Oakland, Calif.-
based airlines flies to five cities in the Northwest with Jetstream
31 turboprop aircraft. Documents begin at $17.50, while packages up
to 25 pounds are $35 and to 50 pounds are $50.     

* Evergreen International Airlines, making avionics history, flew
around the world using a Boeing 747 navigated completely by a GPS
system. The system, a Canard Aerospace/Trimble 8100, was granted
supplemental type certification by the Federal Aviation
Administration following the flight which left New York's JFK
International Airport on Dec. 22 and returned on Dec. 25. 

* United Airlines ordered two new Boeing 747-400s for delivery in
1997, bringing the carrier's total to 28 of the cargo-friendly
aircraft. United will take delivery of two 747-400s this year and
retire three 747-100s. 

* Fritz Companies' Rochester, N.Y. office has been given a free
trade zone designation by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The
designation allows the location to be treated as though it exists
outside the U.S., employing increased flexibility in storage,
inspection, repackaging and labeling.

UAL CARGO DENVER FACES TOUGH COMPETITION FROM TRUCKERS

    DENVER -- United Airlines Cargo's operation at Denver
International Airport has experienced a mix of improvements and
problems since its move from Stapleton International almost a year
ago. Although the cargo facilities are larger -- with a net gain of
22,000 square feet of space and better equipped -- it is located
three and a half miles from the main terminal making last minute
additions a near impossibility. The one-way tug ride from South
Service Center to the terminal takes a minimum of 20 minutes.
Operational costs have more than tripled at the new airport, but
Dick Martino, United's manager for cargo services, maintains it is
still a profitable station. 
    The Denver operation is the fourth largest in United's domestic
system in terms of volume. It is also the most technologically
advanced. Yet growth opportunities look dim for heavy freight. "We
are really struggling with a diminishing manufacturing base because
most area companies are paper-based," Martino says. 
    Calling trucks his most fervent competitor, Martino says the
airlines and truckers go head-to-head for shipments destined within
a 500 mile radius of the airport. "Truckers have really learned to
do business," Martino says. "On the rate side they have always been
there, but they are becoming much smarter and better automated." 
    Still, air cargo in Denver managed 16% growth in 1995.
Agricultural products are a mainstay for the Denver operation,
namely beef from Nebraska, Iowa and Colorado headed for the Far
East. United's Small Package Dispatch (SPD) also is gaining ground.
SPD pieces travel in the baggage mode, can not exceed 70 pounds and
receive same-day service. Denver posted a record month for SPD in
October with more than 1 million pounds shipped. An average month
is closer to between 300,000 and 500,000 pounds. 
    The U.S. mail is also big business for United's Denver Cargo
operation. United carries 70% of the U.S. mail in Denver and is the
only carrier with a direct link to the U.S. Postal Service
facility. 
    Denver is really a trucking market for United, Martino says. And
it is forced to be because 80% of the aircraft United flies into
the market are narrowbodies typically filled with passengers,
baggage and ski equipment in the winter months, not leaving much
room for cargo. In the summer, Denver is plagued by thin air and
high temperatures, which proves to be an impossible combination for
freight because the aircraft is invariably weight restricted. Twenty
of the 270 daily United flights from Denver are served with
widebodies. United's largest port at Chicago O'Hare International
has the same fleet mix, Martino says, because the widebodies are
relegated to the coasts for international flights.

CATHAY PACIFIC TAPS BOEING TO MODIFY THREE 747s TO ALL-CARGO 

     Cathay Pacific gave Boeing's Wichita Division a contract to
modify three Boeing 747-200 combi aircraft into full cargo
configuration for lease to Air Hong Kong. Cathay, which owns 75% of
the all-cargo carrier, purchased the aircraft from Brazilian carrier
Varig S.A. The aircraft will replace Air Hong Kong's present pair
of leased 747 freighters. Air Hong Kong flies to Manchester,
England, Brussels and Nagoya, Japan. The Nagoya route will be moved
to Osaka in March and the carrier plans to add a new trans-Pacific
route when the third aircraft enters the fleet.
