<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   President Menem's labor reform, if successful,
will have far-reaching and positive implications  for the health care industry
as funds formerly used for union boondoggles will pour into health services.  It
will also pave the way for a boom in private health plans. &#167;  Spain's Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya has bought a controlling stake in Banco Frances.  &#167;  
Customs and tax collection authority will be merged into a single office as part
of efforts to stop contraband estimated to be as much as $2 billion a year.

<P><B>CHILE</B>  &#167;  President Frei reshuffled five key posts in hopes of
giving new life to flagging political and economic  reform projects halfway
through his six-year term.  &#167;  Authorities have denied a Norwegian
fish-processing concern permission to fish in Chilean waters. Local

The giant Luksic group plans to issue new shares in its industrial holding

<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   The IMF is pressuring the government to put the
brakes on spending and to stop stepping on the  central bank's toes. The Fund's
admonitions come against a background of accelerating inflation and rising
business anger.   &#167;   In good news for its efforts to issue $150 million in
oil-backed bonds later this year, Ecopetrol has confirmed major petroleum
reserves in the Coporo field, its first major oil discovery on its own.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>GUATEMALA</B>  &#167;  President Arzu has launched a flashy
anti-corruption drive that is clearly good public relations,  but also another
large step forward in improving the investment climate following successful
peace talks with the guerrillas. He hopes a better climate will produce new
investment and aid monies for the faltering economy.  &#167;  Telecommunications
and electricity privatization laws are waiting in the wings, but must overcome
congressional opposition.   Page 6</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;   Exporters and Cassandra economist Rudiger Dornbusch
are warning that a strong peso is heading  Mexico towards a fall. But President
Zedillo defends the nearly two-year-old free float, arguing that it would be too
risky to change forex rules now. Economists point out there is no evidence to
back the contention that the peso is overvalued.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA  </B> &#167;  Flush with oil revenues and new aid and
investment, the government appears to have turned  its back on budget reform,
but it is still pursuing privatizations and tax reform.  &#167;  Tax institute
Seniat hopes to more than double the tax base by lowering the income tax ceiling
in a bill to be presented to congress soon. &#167; Privatization authorities
have leapt hurdles in the upcoming sales of steel, aluminum, telecommunications
and banking assets.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>IMF MEETING/FINANCE MINISTERS' REPORT</B>   &#167;   The tide of Latin
American finance ministers  visiting New York and Washington last week in
connection with the IMF/World Bank annual meeting gave Latin America watchers a
chance to hear 1997 economic plans and financial outlooks from the very men in
charge of making the predictions come true. The ministers were unanimously
devoted to a new wave of privatizations, particularly of infrastructure
holdings, as a means to eliminate production bottlenecks and help achieve
deficit cutting goals.  Pages 9-10</P>

<H1>Peso Debate Flares Up, But Zedillo Not Likely To Devalue Currency</H1>
<P>US economist Rudiger Dornbusch, once again warning that Mexico is taking a
major risk by not adjusting the peso exchange rate against the dollar, has
echoed a growing number of Mexican politicians and business leaders demanding a
devaluation. But President Ernesto Zedillo and key economic authorities do not
seem likely any time soon to bow to pressure to abandon the free float
established after Mexico's disastrous devaluation nearly two years ago.</P>
<P><B>Exporters Angry.</B> On October 4 , Guanajuato governor Vicente Fox, of
the conservative opposition National Action Party (PAN), demanded a devaluation
at the inaugural ceremony of an industrialists meeting attended by President
Ernesto Zedillo. Fox, whose family owns several small businesses exporting
broccoli and shoes, said a devaluation is necessary to keep exports attractive.
Hector Larios, chairman of the Coordinating Business Council, the country's top
umbrella organization of business groups, argued the government should strive to
keep the peso undervalued to keep the economy competitive. </P>
<P>President Zedillo responded that his government would keep the peso on a
free float, saying it would be risky and inconsistent to go back on the policy
established only two years ago and instead commit the country to a floating band
or crawling peg system. Indeed, since there is little economic authorities can
do to devalue under the current free float, a devaluation would necessarily mean
moving to a more interventionist exchange system, which would deal a serious
blow to investor confidence.</P>
<P>On October 4, Ariel Buira, vice governor of the Bank of Mexico, said in New
York that the central bank has not spent a single dollar to support the peso in
1996. The only recorded interventions of the Bank of Mexico in the exchange
market have been dollar purchases, which would have weakened the peso, to build
up reserves in preparation for the 1997 federal elections. </P>
<P><B>How Strong Is It Really?</B> Studies say exactly the opposite of
exporters. The Private Sector Center for Economic Studies (CEESP), a think tank
supported by the Business Coordinating Council, argues that the peso is
undervalued by a negligible 2% against the US dollar. The CEESP uses 1977 as its
base year. The Bank of Mexico claims the peso is undervalued 41% against a
basket of 133 foreign currencies using 1970 as the base year.</P>
<P>If the peso is overvalued, this has not yet become apparent in the trade
balance. The country registered a January through August trade surplus of $4.8
billion, 6% higher than in the same period of 1995. Imports, how ever, are once
again growing faster than exports. Although Mexico is still expected to finish
1996 with a trade surplus of about $7 billion, this surplus will likely be
erased in 1997 unless the peso weakens again.</P>
<P>Gross reserves remain remarkably stable. They have fluctuated between $15.4
-$16 billion throughout 1996. Most of that money, however is tied to short-term
multilateral loans. Net reserves are said to be about $4 billion, too low to
maintain a more interventionist exchange system.</P>
<P>Interest rates, meanwhile, have been falling. One month Treasury bills
(Cetes) stood at almost 49% in December 1995. They are now below 23%.  Real
interest rates are much lower now than a few months ago. Monetary policy is
becoming more relaxed, exactly the opposite of what one could expect if the
central bank were propping the peso artificially. The basic monetary indicator,
M1, rose 46% year-on-year in August and 41% year-on-year in July. </P>
<P>Still,  the exchange rate has not weakened. At the end of 1995 the wholesale
rate stood at P7.69 to the dollar. By October 9 it was P7.57. This represents a
1.5% strengthening of the peso in spite of 20% inflation in the period. </P>
<P><B>Zedillo Defends Stability. </B>President Zedillo's defense of a stable
peso has surprised many observers. In his National Development Plan, made public
in May 1995, his administration argued that the peso should be devalued
gradually in order to maintain a competitive exchange rate. The Bank of Mexico
strongly opposed this position, fighting to maintain the float and arguing that
a weak peso would merely generate inflation without promoting growth. </P>
<P>The National Development Plan indicated that a floating system would be
maintained in the short term. There are indications, however, that the float
might be prolonged indefinitely. Although the Bank of Mexico intervened at
various times in 1995 to stabilize the peso, it did so by injecting very small
amounts of dollars into the market, typically $150 million each time. This is
not enough to make much of a difference in an exchange market involving
transactions of $4-$5 billion a day. </P>
<P><B>Finance Coming Around?</B> The finance ministry, which in 1995 defended
the idea of returning the peso to a scheduled gradual devaluation, is apparently
beginning to accept the Bank of Mexico's position that in an open economy, it is
virtually impossible for the government to manipulate the exchange market for
long. A top finance secretariat official has told Lagniappe that he and his
colleagues are surprised by the stability of the peso under the present float.
Finance ministry agreement is key, since it has veto power over major foreign
exchange decisions in the government's exchange commission, which includes three
finance ministry and three central bank officials.</P>
