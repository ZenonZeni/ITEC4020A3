O.T. Studios, originally known as Outreach Tapes, was founded by John Schweikert as a family business in 1975.  John began by duplicating message tapes for churches, adding equipment and facilities as the business grew.  His desire was to spread the Word of God through the ministry of cassette tapes.  The business rapidly expanded to include both <A HREF="#Studio Services">audio and video duplication</A>, and soon grew to include <A HREF="#Convention Services">seminar and conference services</A>, and CD replication as well.  <BR><BR>The growing demands brought other family members and "extended" family members to the ranks, each with the same commitment to the Lord and to the ministry of O.T. Studios.  Today, the company employs over 20 men and women, all considered to be part of "the O.T. Family."
