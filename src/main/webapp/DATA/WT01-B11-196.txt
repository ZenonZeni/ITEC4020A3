<B>1996 Provincial Parks Season Has Begun

</B>

</CENTER><P>
This year, most provincial parks in southern Ontario opened on May 10, while in Northern Ontario, opening season for many parks will begin May 17.<P>

As in previous years, an alcohol ban is in place from May 10 to May 20 in selected provincial parks across the province.  (List of provincial parks provided at end of release.)<P>

With the creation of Ontario Parks, visitors will begin to see some changes in how provincial parks are being managed this year.<P>

"Ontario Parks now have a revenue-retention system that ensures money raised at the parks stays within the parks system," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "Ontario's provincial parks will be operating more like a business as we work with potential partners and sponsors to ensure park visitors receive the services and products they want and need, and to ensure that our parks continue to be the finest in the world."<P>

Ontario's 265 provincial parks cover 6.2 million hectares and attract more than eight million visitors annually.<P>

"The protection of Ontario's natural and cultural heritage within provincial parks continues to be a priority for this government," said Mr. Hodgson.  "As we enter what is expected to be another busy season, I would like to thank the people of Ontario for their ongoing support and interest in Ontario's provincial parks."<P>

The <I>1996 Provincial Parks Guide</I> provides detailed information about Ontario's provincial parks.  The guide will be available soon at provincial parks, MNR offices, Ontario Travel Information centres, and Natural Resources Information Centres in Toronto and Peterborough.<P>

A telephone report on campsite vacancies will be available on weekends only, from Victoria Day to the third weekend in June, then daily until Labour Day, by calling 1-800 ONTARIO (668-2746) or (416) 314-0998 in Toronto. <P>
