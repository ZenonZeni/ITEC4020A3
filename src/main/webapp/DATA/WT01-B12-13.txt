 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOTHER OF HORMONES </H2>

<P>   DHEA is called the mother of hormones by researchers because it is used by the body to manufacture many other hormones, including our sex hormones that are necessary for many bodily functions. Some of these are well known, such as estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, cortisone and others. They are responsible for the maintenance of many bodily functions such as fat and mineral metabolism, controlling stress, maintaining male and female characteristics and others. The body produces DHEA and then converts it on demand to these other hormones. In addition, we now know that each of our cells also have DHEA receptors, meaning that DHEA has its own effects as well.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGING</H2>
<P>   This wonderful substance is abundant in our bodies when we are about 20 years old but continues to decrease with time. At 80 years of age, we usually only produce about 10 to 20% of the amounts when we were in our 20's. Interestingly, the steady declining levels of DHEA in our blood stream as we age perfectly matches the increasing incidence of the killer diseases cancer, heart disease (including atherosclerosis) and Alzheimer's disease.</P>
<P>  Much research has shown the major importance of DHEA levels in the prevention of these kinds of disease.   For example, a 1988 study at Johns Hopkins showed 50% reduction in arterial plaque in rabbits. A Temple University study showed supplemental DHEA was able to prevent breast cancer in mice that were prone to develop it. The studies also showed the prevention of lung and bowel tumors plus the extension of life span. A study in Guernsey, U.K. showed women destined to develop breast cancer had low DHEA levels up to nine years previous.  Doctors at the Medical College of Virginia showed lower DHEA levels were associated with build-up of atherosclerotic plaque and that higher  insulin  levels  from  the  ingestion  of  simple carbohydrates caused a reduction of DHEA levels in the body. Maintaining DHEA levels in the body has been shown to be important in improving memory, preventing Alzheimer's disease and osteoporosis in post-menopausal women.</P>
<P>   A twelve year study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1986 (315.1519-24) reported that of the 242 men aged 50-79 studied: "A I00 microgram per deciliter increase in DHEA sulfate concentration corresponded with a 48% reduction in mortality due to cardiovascular disease and a 36% reduction in mortality for any reason. The natural level of DHEA sulfate was measured and those individuals with higher DHEA sulfate levels lived longer and had much lower risk of heart disease."</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WEIGHT CONTROL</H2>
<P>   One of the most exciting benefits of DHEA is its ability to burn fat and help keep it off by converting fat to muscle. It is a "thermogenic" substance because it helps burn calories for energy rather than store them as fat.</P>

<P>   Dr. A. Schwartz, a researcher at Temple University, has now proven beyond question DHEA's effectiveness in weight control.  DHEA's ability to block an enzyme named G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase) may be one of the most significant finds of the century.  This enzyme is not only essential for fat tissue production but also promotes cancer cell growth. By blocking it, DHEA's action of reducing body fat and helping to prevent against cancer may be explained. DHEA's weight control effect does not seem to be so diet dependent. No matter what you eat, DHEA still has benefits of weight loss. Of course, dietary modification, exercise and lifestyle are important in weight control but it is exciting to obtain benefits of such a fantastic natural substance at whatever level of commitment you want to make.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE FORMULATION</H2>
<P>   DHEA has probably become the most extensively studied substance in recent history. This is because it plays such an important role in metabolism and can have such an amazing positive effect when used as a specialized supplement. DHEA is a much needed substance to maintain youthful vigor, a lean body and many other desirable traits.  Our endocrine (hormonal) system is virtually dependent on adequate levels of DHEA, but unfortunately levels decrease as we age. Many researchers believe that decreasing levels of DHEA contribute to symptoms normally associated with aging as well as many degenerative conditions such as cancer and atherosclerosis or hardening of the arteries.</P>

<P> ENDOCRYN DHEA not only contains a full 30 mg of the prohormone DHEA, but also 10 mg of a high quality Phytosterol Complex that also serves as fuel for the endocrine system. The herbal concentrates, amino acids, pantothenic acid and magnesium nutritionally support adrenal function for optimum health.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  ENDOCRYN DHEA is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the  numerous  health  supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE IT</H2>
<P>  As a natural DHEA supplement for general use, it is usually recommended to take one tablet from one to three times a day.  Larger individuals, or those desiring a more aggressive approach, may take more for a month or two. The goal is to provide your body with the DHEA and nutritional materials to support your adrenal glands so they can produce and maintain healthy DHEA levels.</P>
