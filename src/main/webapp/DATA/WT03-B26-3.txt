<B>PREAMBLE</B> <BR>
<BR>
The compilation of this document was both a pleasure and a challenge. <BR>
<BR>
It was a pleasure because all the authors believe in the concept of the
Earth Observation Centre and are committed to its implementation. It was
challenge to find and articulate the shared core of agreement. That was
not easy: the debate has been spirited and detailed with independent inputs
from many interested research staff. <BR>
<BR>
Even so, the four authors of this document share its vision and mission,
and are committed to their implementation. However, the separate groups
of research staff represented by each author differed in their support of
the three areas of research activity defined below. Research areas 1 &amp;
2, which will account for almost all activity (&gt;95%) was supported everywhere,
whereas area 3 was only supported by Melbourne, Hobart and Canberra. <BR>
<BR>
In this section of our report, we set out the argument that we developed
since being commissioned and which has shaped the research strategy proposed
in the next section. <BR>
<BR>
Two propositions underpin all. <BR>
<BR>
The first is that CSIRO is a research organisation: its prime directive
is to undertake scientific research. Within CSIRO, components such as COSSA
and CIRC, have different functions. Even though the concept of the Earth
Observation Centre arose from a COSSA-initiated review, and COSSA has the
responsibility to create the Earth Observation Centre, the essential nature
of the Earth Observation Centre will differ substantially from that of COSSA.
The Earth Observation Centre will be part of main-stream CSIRO. <B>Therefore
the prime directive and ethos of the Earth Observation Centre must be the
conduct of scientific research.</B> <BR>
<BR>
This is an important point that was raised in the Implementation Document(COSSA
Steering Committee) and we reiterate it here. <BR>
<BR>
The concerns that led to the concept of the Earth Observation Centre partly
arose from data issues; of these, some were related to research but most
were not. A focus on data issues dominates the circulated vision and mission
discussions in the 'Implementation Plan' and the draft 'Outline of Strategic
Plan, etc.'. We do not accept this emphasis. We are convinced that an Earth
Observation Centre within CSIRO must be based on relevant, high quality
research activities. <BR>
<BR>
Therefore, this document proposes a wider view that embraces all data issues
and integrates them within a comprehensive research strategy. <BR>
<BR>
<B>This view is that in the current era of Earth observation activities,
research and data are inextricably and synergistically linked. </B><BR>
<BR>
It is obvious to us that a strategy of emphasising data at the expense of
research has no future in the CSIRO of today or tomorrow. Conversely, a
strategy of research that ignores data management will continue the emasculated
conditions of these last few years that led to the formation of MDP # 19,
and its subsequent review. <BR>
<BR>
The second proposition is that the Earth Observation Centre should address
the big issues: those characterised by broad spatial scales over long time
intervals to which Earth Observation data make a unique and underpinning
contribution. These are the issues that can really only be addressed with
space data. Moreover, we should address not only the current research questions
but what is more important, consider those questions that are not presently
being asked. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Earth Observation Centre should become a leading and singular research
institution. </B><BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, we believe this can be achieved in a manner that is complementary
to activities within Divisions and without excluding any significant research
themes. We illustrate this with a hypothetical research program in the Appendix.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>On the basis of on these two propositions, the central thrust of this
document is to propose a bold but operationally sustainable integration
of research and data management, the Research Strategy, to underpin the
Earth Observation Centre over the next five years, 1995-2000. </B><BR>
<BR>
In addition, we also discuss several implementation issues that we believe
are not usefully separated from the proposed Research Strategy. Like the
Strategy, these implementation issues have been discussed amongst us and
the views of our colleagues that were canvassed and considered. <BR>
<BR>
To illustrate and support our proposals made in the next section, we here
collect some the many facets of shaping the Earth Observation Centre that
were considered. <BR>
<BR>
The acceptability of the Earth Observation Centre within CSIRO management
and its attractiveness to research staff will be determined almost entirely
by the formulation and implementation of its Research Strategy. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, once accepted, the Earth Observation Centre Research
Strategy must be widely and speedily communicated within CSIRO, and implemented
in the Earth Observation Centre development. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Because COSSA and the Earth Observation Centre have very different roles
and responsibilities within CSIRO, the Earth Observation Centre must be
independent of COSSA in the pursuit of its role within the constraint of
its essential requirement to report to the Director of COSSA. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, it is essential that the research and development
directions of the Earth Observation Centre be set by the Leader and staff
with input from Divisions and an Advisory Committee (see later). </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Now that the Earth Observation Centre is a reality, albeit still a fledgling,
its identity and support needs to be indelibly confirmed. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, we recommend that MDP #19 be terminated as soon as
is possible and that its remaining funding be transferred to the Leader
of the Earth Observation Centre for disposition, and that this financial
independence be continued; </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>in addition, we believe it to be critical that the Earth Observation
Centre creates and communicates its own identity, and manages its own information
access independently of COSSA. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Two aspects of the creation of the Earth Observation Centre will enhance
remote sensing within CSIRO: by providing a disciplinary focus, and, more
influential, by the collocation of staff. However, if staff remain distributed
across Australia, then opportunities for productive interaction will remain
limited and thus the output of the Earth Observation Centre is unlikely
to be very different from the current output from the separate Divisions.
<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, the collocation of staff is obviously the preferred
option wherever possible but it remains a practical problem that must be
faced. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
The Earth Observation Centre research areas should not be traditional discipline
areas, for otherwise the overlap with Divisions will be too great and the
necessity of the Earth Observation Centre will be questioned. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore the Earth Observation Centre must include in its research
focus, areas that do not rest comfortably within Divisions or cover areas
common to many Divisions. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
While it is important to set out the long term strategic goals of the research
and development, their creation will always risk the generation of unrealistic
expectations amongst some users. <BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, the Earth Observation Centre should set both long
term strategic goals as well as short term objectives arising from interactions
with the user communities; <BR>
<BR>
the Earth Observation Centre objectives should be clear, open and achievable
with the resources available. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<B>RESEARCH STRATEGY</B> <BR>
<BR>
The research strategy that we outline below is simple, general, and has
three components; vision, mission and activities. <BR>
<BR>
No specific objectives are defined. <BR>
<BR>
We see the essential role of the Earth Observation Centre as being synergistic
and facilitating for research scientists already actively engaged in their
own research and responsive their own interests, capabilities and funding.
The focus of the Earth Observation Centre will enhance this research activity,
and through coordinated data management, benefit a larger and more diverse
clientele than before. <BR>
<BR>
The focus of the Earth Observation Centre is not to re-orient existing research
in the short term: rather, we want to do what we do far more effectively.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Vision Statement.</B> <BR>
<BR>
We begin with a succinct statement of the essential nature and direction
of the Earth Observation Centre: <BR>
<BR>
<B>'To ensure that Australia gains maximum benefit from the application
of Earth Observation data.'</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mission Statement</B> <BR>
<BR>
Translating the Vision statement into a broad action plan, we write: <BR>
<BR>
<B>'The Earth Observation Centre will conduct multidisciplinary research
and development based on remotely sensed and other data for the benefit
of the Australian and global communities'</B> <BR>
<BR>
We see this benefit being realised from the innovative and efficient extraction
of relevant information from Earth Observation data. These three adjectives
link research, development and application; they describe the three components
required for an end-to-end approach. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Research Activities</B> <BR>
<BR>
The research objectives pursued within the Earth Observation Centre will
be diverse, reflecting the interests and collaboration of individual scientists.
Therefore, as discussed above, it is difficult and counter-productive to
define and prioritise research objectives. It is far more useful to define
the three areas of research activity within which the spectrum of research
effort could be managed. Continuing and potential cooperation and collaboration
with research staff from CSIRO Divisions and other organisations (DEST,
DoPI&amp;E, DSTO) is implicit throughout. <BR>
<BR>
While these activities are broadly defined below, they proscribe farm-level
decision-support systems, that are increasingly being covered by other public
and private sector organisations. <BR>
<BR>
The three areas of research activities follow. These activities are exemplified
in the Appendix that also illustrates the nature and extent of the potential
interactions between the EOC and CSIRO Divisions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>1. Earth Observation Science and Data Analysis</B>: To undertake the
research necessary for the development of generic methods (measurement models)
to relate satellite data recorded above the Earth's atmosphere to geophysical
variables; these variables being required to address broader current and
potential research questions within the Earth Observation Centre, CSIRO
and the wider research community. <BR>
<BR>
Measurement models include scene, sensor, atmosphere and image processing
sub-models that in combination, determine the accuracy and precision of
the derived geophysical variables. <BR>
<BR>
Measurement models are required for the retrospective analysis of current
Earth Observation data archives, eg. AVHRR, as well as for the prospective
datasets, eg. ADEOS, SPOT Vegetation Instrument, SeaWIFS and EOS. <BR>
<BR>
While it has and will continue to be applications research that creates
the need for highest quality Earth Observation datasets, <B>it is the development
and application of measurement models that remains the key to the production
of the value-added datasets required by the research community</B>. <BR>
<BR>
As an illustration, an AVHRR Science Working Group has been established,
originally within MDP #19 and now the EOC, to prescribe the processing of
a standard set of geophysical datasets to be generated by the EOC and made
available to CSIRO research staff: these datasets include sea surface temperature
(SST), land surface temperature (LST), surface albedo (a VIS, a NIR, a SOLAR)
and NDVI (a vegetation index). In addition, an analogous GMS Pathfinder
Science Working Group has been established in collaboration with the University
of California, the Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian National University,
and the University of Tasmania. <BR>
<BR>
<B>2. Calibration / Validation</B>: To undertake the required field and
laboratory research to support the development of measurement models evaluating
either the accuracy of sensor performance (calibration) or of derived geophysical
variables (validation). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Both measurement models</B>, when translated to algorithms, <B>and Calibration
/ Validation activities</B> as a source of ancillary data and process understanding,
<B>are fundamental to the generation and documentation of geophysical data
sets for distribution by the CSIRO DAACs for subsequent application by the
wider research community.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Calibration / Validation research activities are critical to success in
addressing many contemporary scientific questions: it is not an unreasonable
assertion that it is now the most critical issue in the application of space
data. The importance of Calibration / Validation research is now widely
recognised by organisations such as CEOS and EOS, and by individual spacecraft
missions that have sought, or are seeking CSIRO expertise in this research
area; eg. the ATSR instrument on ERS-1/2, POLDER on ADEOS, and the Vegetation
Instrument on SPOT 4. <BR>
<BR>
Calibration / Validation research activities will ensure the highest quality
datasets are available to the Australian and global research communities.
It is anticipated that within this research activity, there will be considerable
collaboration with Divisional research staff; see Appendix. <BR>
<BR>
<B>3. Sensors and Systems:</B> Australia has a growing aerospace industry
that has, in the past, found valuable research support for development programs
from within CSIRO. These activities will continue to grow and CSIRO has
a vital role to play in supporting these programs. The research skills required
for the success of development programs in Earth Observation are currently
not available from other Australian institutes. <BR>
<BR>
It is important that there is a national focus for this area of research
and, for CSIRO, the activity is far better suited to the EOC than to individual
Divisions. <BR>
<BR>
The Earth Observation Centre can become this focus through secondment from
CSIRO or from industry, and <B>by managing the research component only</B>.
<BR>
<BR>
These three research activities represent a significant change in emphasis
and allocation of tasks from the Earth Observation Centre concept proposed
by COSSA in the draft Implementation Plan. <B>The emphasis has been placed
on getting the research component right but not to the exclusion of data
management</B> that is implicit in all that is stated above. <BR>
<BR>
Stated simply: <BR>
<BR>
Co-ordinated scientific research and development is the only sustainable
locomotive for generating useful Earth Observation value-added products;
<BR>
<BR>
Strategic research and development first requires, and then generates Earth
Observation datasets; <BR>
<BR>
The two key elements are co-ordinated Research and Development, and Data
Management. <BR>
<BR>
Both elements are critical and interactive, but for the Australian community
to benefit from Earth Observation Centre activities the nature and direction
of Data Management activities must support and complement those of Research
and Development. <BR>
<BR>
We envisage an interactive interdependence of Research and Development and
Data Management within the Earth Observation Centre, and this relationship
is simplified in the following diagram. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="diag.gif" ALIGN=bottom WIDTH="781" HEIGHT="847" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
<BR>
Data Management alone is a relatively simple problem to solve. It is far
more difficult to co-ordinate Research and Development with Data Management
so that end-to-end solutions are provided and the value-added datasets generated
and captured. Nonetheless, we see the solution to this problem as being
one of research-leadership rather that data-driven. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Leader</B> <BR>
<BR>
Because the scope of Earth Observation Centre research activities is so
broad, it is unlikely that any one person can be an effective research leader.
The maintenance of research standards can be assured with the review process
within and without the Earth Observation Centre. However, the maintenance
and co-ordination of research effort and the interaction with clients, both
actual and potential, are by far the most important tasks to keep the Earth
Observation Centre on track and viable. <BR>
<BR>
Thus, we see the critical attributes of the Leader as being: <BR>
<BR>
a distinguished background in Earth Observation science; <BR>
<BR>
a capacity and willingness to manage the Earth Observation Centre research;
<BR>
<BR>
a capacity to find and interact with the beneficiaries of Earth Observation
Centre activities both within and without CSIRO; <BR>
<BR>
a capacity and willingness to seek external funding. <BR>
<BR>
We also believe the next critical step in the development of the Earth Observation
Centre is the appointment of the Leader. We urge that this be urgently addressed
with the leader being appointed for an initial period of 5 years, located
in Canberra. <BR>
<BR>
<B>REFLECTION and GUIDANCE</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Earth Observation Centre is a new concept within CSIRO and effectively
without peer within Australia; the organisations of ERIN (DEST), NRIC and
AGSO, both (DoPI&amp;E), being considered in this assessment. The role models,
or at least analogues of the Earth Observation Centre are thus mostly international.
Therefore, attention must be given to providing mechanisms that will provide
an international reflection of our direction, activities and performance
in a way that will support the best possible management of the Earth Observation
Centre resources; people, funds, and time. <BR>
<BR>
Two mechanisms are suggested: the Earth Observation Centre Fellowships,
and an Advisory Committee. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Earth Observation Centre Fellowships</B> <BR>
<BR>
The Earth Observation Centre Fellowships have already started with the first
and current award being to Jim Simpson. Jim Simpson has played a significant
role in the concept and establishment of the Earth Observation Centre and
he has continued to contribute to research during the brief period of his
Fellowship. <BR>
<BR>
Following in this role, Earth Observation Centre Fellowships can provide
a mirror to our performance and direction. To do this, the award needs to
be to a distinguished but interesting and active scientist, for a brief
period of time. Earth Observation Centre Fellowships are different from,
and in addition to, visiting research scientists to the Centre. <BR>
<BR>
It is recommended that the award by invitation of Earth Observation Centre
Fellowships be continued at an annual rate, and that they continue to be
carefully selected such that the benefit to the Earth Observation Centre
is clear and widely distributed. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Advisory Committee</B> <BR>
<BR>
We believe that the direction and functioning of the Earth Observation Centre
would benefit from interaction with a small expert committee - an Advisory
Committee. <BR>
<BR>
Because of the vision and mission of the Earth Observation Centre, we suggest
this small committee be convened annually and comprise the following: <BR>
<BR>
Director, COSSA <BR>
<BR>
Leader, Earth Observation Centre <BR>
<BR>
Chief of Division (one only, most relevant, rotating) <BR>
<BR>
Bureau of Meteorology representative (most relevant) <BR>
<BR>
NASA representative (eg. Martha Maiden) <BR>
<BR>
ESA representative (eg. equivalent to NASA representative) <BR>
<BR>
Research institution analogue (rotating, eg. Yann Kerr, Director of LERTS).
<BR>
<BR>
The intent and function of this Advisory Committee are clear from our suggested
membership. The final choice should be made by the Leader of the Earth Observation
Centre. <BR>
<BR>
We believe it is critical to regularly take professional advice from a wide
range of sources; particularly from outside CSIRO and Australia because
the Earth Observation Centre will become a significant functional link in
the emerging international web of Earth Observation science and data analysis.
To orient our activities by the Earth Observation Centre Vision - to ensure
that Australia gains maximum benefit from the innovative and efficient application
of Earth Observation data - we must regularly assess our performance by
international standards. <BR>
<BR>
<B>APPENDIX</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Research Strategy exemplified</B> <BR>
<BR>
To illustrate how the research strategy would be applied in the EOC, a fictitious
example is described which also illustrates the perceived roles of the EOC
and individual Divisions and the way these groups may interact on common
research topics. <BR>
<BR>
The example given is for an application of AVHRR data, but future EOC activities
will also include data from other earth observation instruments and platforms
(e.g. SAR, SeaWiFS, OCTS, MODIS etc.). <BR>
<BR>
THE APPLICATION OF AVHRR DATA IN THE MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH OF LOCUST PLAGUE
EVENTS <BR>
<BR>
Project Stages. <BR>
<BR>
<B>1. Reception</B> (direct or indirect) of raw AVHRR data over the study
area. <BR>
<BR>
<B>2. Routine processing</B> of AVHRR data to provide at-satellite, navigated
brightness temperatures in the infrared channels and radiances in the visible/near
infrared channels. <BR>
<BR>
This activity requires conversion of the raw data using calibration coefficients
and navigation into earth coordinates using orbital elements, an orbital
model and ground control points. <BR>
<BR>
<B>3. Derivation of standard geophysical products</B> from the brightness
temperatures/radiances. <BR>
<BR>
These products include sea surface temperature, land surface temperature,
surface albedo and NDVI (a vegetation index). <BR>
<BR>
The production of these parameters requires the detection of cloud contaminated
data, correction for atmospheric effects (absorption and scattering) and
the inclusion of surface and solar geometry. <BR>
<BR>
The four products mentioned above should be considered standard products
that will be produced automatically by the EOC for use by CSIRO Divisions
in their research programs, and in applications developed by particular
divisions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>4. Standard statistical techniques</B> for data analysis, compositing
of data, production of time series, filling in missing (cloudy) values,
etc. <BR>
<BR>
<B>5. Development of new parameters</B> for highlighting locust active or
affected areas (new NDVIs?, thermal data may be useful here?). <BR>
<BR>
Comparisons with climatological data. <BR>
<BR>
Collection of ground data for validation of satellite-derived parameters.
<BR>
<BR>
Development of task-specific analysis techniques. <BR>
<BR>
<B>6. Assessment of locust damage</B>, forecast of locust paths, deployment
of ground based resources (aircraft spraying of insecticide etc.). <BR>
<BR>
Use of satellite data to forecast future areas of locust plague outbreaks.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>EOC activities: </B>Actions 1, 2, 3 and 4 as described above are activities
that are common to any research project or application of satellite data
and these should be seen as the responsibility of the EOC. The first research
activity described in the strategy thus includes investigations to provide
high quality standard geophysical data products from satellite data. These
activities will include data calibration, cloud detection and clearing,
correction for atmospheric effects in the visible, infrared and microwave
bands, navigation of satellite data and the development of common statistical
techniques for data analysis. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Divisional activities: </B>Actions 5 and 6 clearly belong in individual
Divisions of CSIRO as they pertain to specific research programs and applications.
However, there are obviously areas here where some interaction is required.
For example, the ground validation data collected by the Division should
be used by the EOC in the assessment of the quality of their derived standard
products. Divisions may also
