<h3><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>The secondary school years represent a significant period of
transition for adolescents (Levine, 1988). Students move from
pupil-oriented elementary or lower schools to more content-driven
secondary school settings. Students with disorders of learning and/or
attention can find graduating with a high school diploma increasingly
problematic. Often, students with learning disorders lack the requisite
skills for success and therefore are not ready to meet academic  
expectations. Moreover, traditional classroom teaching techniques may not be
suited to their particular learning strengths and content affinities or
interests.

<p>It is becoming readily apparent that within the adolescent age group,
traditional criteria and definitions of learning disability fall far short of
capturing the actual phenomena that lead to academic failure. Many of the
learning and attentional problems of secondary school students simply do not
conform to the subtests of an IQ test or the parameters tapped by traditional
group achievement assessments. Consequently, many struggling adolescents &quot;fall
between the cracks&quot; of diagnostic insight. The reasons for their
difficulty are misconstrued, and commonly they are deprived of needed
services and accommodations.

<p>In this chapter we are advocating a substantial broadening of the concept of
learning disorder. Our paradigm shift entails the recognition and proper
interpretation of clinical phenomena that are readily observable in the
classroom. Some of these phenomena may reveal themselves on standardized tests
while others are simply observable within academic contexts. If a student's
patterns of learning and working reveal the presence of one or more such
phenomena, that adolescent should be thought to harbor a disorder that is 
impeding learning and/or academic productivity. The well established
phenomenon in and of itself is a legitimate cause for concern and a clear
indication for intervention. 

<p>Research results suggest many students with learning disorders lack the
necessary skills to succeed in general education settings (Deshler, Schumaker,
Alley, Warner, & Clark, 1982) perform below the 10th percentile on
standardized measures of academic achievement (Warner, Schumaker, Alley, &
Deshler, 1980); and lack many of the higher-order thinking skills required of
self-directed learners (Schumaker, Deshler, & Ellis, 1986). Furthermore,
increased requisites for students to receive a standard high school diploma
may include mastering a second language, completing a mandatory mathematics
course such as Algebra 1, and taking four years of language arts and sciences.
Such educational reforms undertaken to produce literate and thoughtful
citizens (e.g., GOALS 2000, Healthy People 2000) may potentially &quot;push-out&quot;
students who realize early in their high school career that they cannot attain
such standards tied to a &quot;normal&quot; diploma; and other types of diplomas
(attendance) are not worth staying in school. The educational and professional
options having a positive life-long impact on these developing adults may be
few for students with disorders of learning and attention.

<p>Results of the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) suggested one
option being used by students with high prevalence/low severity learning
disorders is dropping out (Wagner, 1991). Students with learning disabilities
had the second highest drop-out rate (32%) among exceptional children,
included in a representative national survey. The figures reported in the NLTS
are conservative estimates of the percentage of students with learning
disorders who drop-out because students with learning problems who do not meet
federal and state guidelines for learning disabilities are not included. The
Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development painted the following bleak
economic future for our country and for students who drop-out compared with
students who graduate with a high school diploma (cf Hamburg, 1992): 

<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 
   <dd>the rate of unemployment is double for students who drop-out; 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 
  <dd> over their lifetime the United States loses almost $260 
        billion in lost earnings and taxes; and 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
  <dd> a male high school drop-out earns $260,000 less and 
       contributes $78,000 less in taxes than males who graduate 
       with a diploma; a female drop-out earns $200,000 less and 
       contributes $60,000 less in taxes than females who graduate. 
</dl>

<p>Clearly, the percentage of students who drop out of
school will have enormous implications for the overall well-being of our
economy and of our society as a whole.

<p>Parents, adolescents, and educators are left grappling with significant
educational issues given the multitude of academic, social, and behavioral
problems that can be associated with learning and attentional disorders. What
are the roles of parents, special and general educators, and the students
themselves for managing the educational process in the secondary schools in
view of the wide range of factors contributing to academic success or failure?
What knowledge and skills should teachers have regarding these students so as
to manage more effectively their education, thereby increasing the probability
that students will experience success and remain in school? The magnitude of
these issues is increased given the mismatch between the rate at which school
districts are adopting and implementing inclusionary models when contrasted
with the speed (and quality?) in which pre- and inservice teachers are being
developed to successfully include all students in their classrooms. 

<p>The purpose of this chapter is to present a phenomenological perspective of
learning disorders. A phenomenological perspective emphasizes improving
classroom teachers' ability to recognize and describe behavior associated with
cognitive, behavioral, and social development of students with high
prevalence/low severity learning disorders. The purpose of such descriptions
is to enhance classroom teachers' ability to manage the education of students
with neurodevelopmental variations in the classroom (i.e., selection of
accommodations, implementation of direct interventions, modification of
classroom materials).

<h3><a name="2"></a>Recognition Of Adolescents' Patterns Of Neurodevelopmental Variation</h3>

<p>As yet, no definition of learning disabilities has produced a consensus
regarding what constitutes a learning disability (Levine, Hooper, Reed,
Sandler, Swartz, & Watson, 1993). All definitions of learning disabilities
remain relatively vague characteristics emphasizing what a learning disability
is not rather than what a learning disability is (Levine, et al, 1993).
Discrepancy formulas, for example, are often intended to exclude students with
mental retardation or &quot;slow learning&quot; but fail to shed light on the specific
forms of learning disability. This has lead to an over reliance on
standardized tests of intelligence and achievement to determine eligibility
for services without illuminating the wider array of learning disorders that
thwart the academic progress of adolescents. From our perspective,
well-educated classroom teachers can derive information about students'
learning disorders by analyzing their error patterns and observing their
behavior. Evidence gathered by classroom teachers, students, and parents can
supplement information gleaned from tests of intelligence and achievement,
thus, providing crucial information aiding in the process of recognizing
students' learning strengths and points of cognitive breakdowns. Importantly ,
we believe that the information provided by a well-educated teacher(s) can
significantly enhance the development and successful implementation of
educational management plans that lead to success for adolescents who are not
meeting classroom expectations and whose external defenses and face saving
tactics mask serious underlying deficits in academic skills, in cognitive
functions, and in the strategies needed to facilitate productivity in school.

<p>In this chapter, we will describe the following four common phenomena of
dysfunction that teachers and parents of adolescents need to be able to
recognize and manage in adolescents: 
<blockquote>
(a) reduced attentional strength;<br>
(b) insufficient memory capacity;<br>
(c) superficial comprehension; and<br>
(d) output problems. 
</blockquote>
The purpose of this section is not to make readers expert
&quot;diagnosticians&quot; but instead to provide examples of phenomena that often
obstruct the quest for success as students traverse the bridge from early
adolescence to early adulthood.

<h3><a name="3"></A>The Phenomena Associated With Reduced Attentional Strength</h3>

<p>The heightened demands of secondary school curricula can place a strain on
adolescents' capacity to  attend to the varied sources of input from teachers,
instructional materials, and peers. Secondary schools require students to
sustain cognitive effort and to concentrate selectively for extended periods.
Many adolescents may lack the attentional capacity to differentiate multiple
levels Of saliency in information and fend off the ever present threat of
mental fatigue. An adolescent's problem attending may be confined to certain
contexts (such as highly verbal settings) or the difficulty can be pervasive
and manifest itself globally as a deficit in one or more of the following
domains: (a) academic recognition; (b) behavioral control; and/or (c) social
cognition (their ability to establish and maintain relationships with peers
and adults [Levine, 1993]). Students with reduced attentional capacity in the
academic/cognitive domain may feel tired, bored, or restless unless they are
focusing on highly stimulating, romantically alluring subject matter or
activities. These students are likely to show signs of insatiability or such
an intense desire for highly pleasurable activities that they are unable to
delay gratification and focus on less exciting stimuli (such as a lecture in
social studies). Frequently, these students are prone to extremes of
distractibility and an inability to be highly selective in their attention.
They focus on irrelevant detail or distractions and seldom make good
determinations of what is important or salient in a task, or a text. For
example, in reading, they may have a poor sense of what is essential to
remember and what is relatively unimportant. Adolescents may also reveal
prominent cognitive impulsivity, a tendency to &quot;undertake tasks hastily and
without sufficient planning. Consequently, many of them are observed to &quot;do
things the hard way.&quot;

<p>Attentional problems in the academic-cognitive domain may or may not coexist
with attentional problems in the behavioral domain. Adolescents with
attentional behavior problems seem to be unable to allocate attentional
resources to previewing the consequences of their behavior, monitoring their
actions or gaining from positive or negative feedback. The dilemma for parents
and teachers is to decide if the behavioral problems are the primary issues to
be dealt with or if these behavioral problems are related to the student's
frustrations over failure in the classroom. Finally, attention problems that
manifest themselves in the domain of social cognition can reveal themselves as
a student's inability to determine and to deploy appropriately the social
skills needed to establish and maintain positive relationships with peers and
adults. Adolescents may voice inappropriate comments, impinge on other
people's &quot;space,&quot; and appear to not have a sense of their negative 
impact on other people.

<p>The attention deficits of adolescents may elude detection because their
manifestations are highly inconsistent. Their difficulties tend to wax and
wane. Consequently, during some hours, on some days, or even for weeks, an
affected student may have no trouble concentrating, only to deteriorate at any
time and for any interval for no apparent reason. Sometimes the test scores
over a semester portray such performance inconsistency all too vividly.
Some adolescents with attention deficits show no evidence of other forms of
learning disorders; however, the existence of attention deficits in isolation
is actually unusual. Most of these students have trouble with other aspects of
function, possibly including memory, higher order thinking skills, language,
motor function or social development Additionally, these students are
susceptible to a range of emotional problems, including depression and other
forms of affective disorder.

<p>It is important to recognize that adolescents with attention deficit are apt
to harbor notable strengths. In particular, many of them are highly creative
and entrepreneurial. Often they are experiential learners. That is, they are
likely to learn most from active participation and direct experience (&quot;on the
job training&quot;) rather than through the usual formal modes of academic
learning.

<hr width="75%">

<h3><a name="4"></a>The Phenomena Associated With Limited Memory Capacity</h3>

<p>The memory demands of secondary school exceed the capabilities of many
students with learning disorders. Secondary school curricula place a premium
on students' cumulative recall of information (e.g., using information in May
that was learned in October), ability to summarize information for oral and
written presentations, differentiation of memory skills by content area and by
teacher expectations, and expectation for metamemory sophistication, or what
individual students know about memory and memory processes (Levine & Reed,
1992). Given the complexity of memory systems, there exist a range of memory
dysfunctions that predispose to academic difficulty. We will describe what we
believe to be four common adolescent disorders of memory.

<p><b>Inadequate Entry Into Short-Term Memory</b><br>
There are students who endure discrete weaknesses of short-term memory. Some
have difficulty &quot;recoding&quot; input by paraphrasing or abbreviating information
in lectures and textbooks to allow complex messages to &quot;fit&quot; within the very
limited capacity of short-term storage. Others have highly specific deficits
with the registration of specific modalities of data into short-term memory.
Thus, an adolescent may have problems entering visual-spatial information
(e.g., from a map), sequential data (e.g., the steps in a math process) or
verbal information (e.g., oral directions from the teacher). Still others fail
to employ effective rehearsal strategies (visual-imaging, sub-vocalization,
and self testing) to facilitate and strengthen entry of information into
short-term memory. These students may have trouble studying for tests and
acquiring new information or skills during class sessions.

<p><b>Active Working Memory Dysfunction</b><br>
Active working memory enables a student to &quot;hold on to&quot; different components
or procedures within a task while working on that task. Students with
dysfunctions of active working memory are likely to forget what they are doing
while they are doing it. Active working memory is vital during extended
periods of writing, while performing mathematics computations, and while
reading. An affected adolescent may lose the essence of the beginning of a
chapter while reading the subsequent sections. He or she may lose track of a
process amid a mathematics problem. The student may forget an idea while
trying to recall a specific spelling word or punctuation rule. Students with
active working memory dysfunctions become understandably discouraged and
anxious in school. They often have serious problems with test-taking and seem
more competent than their performance would indicate.

<p><b>Slow And/Or Imprecise Retrieval Memory</b><br>
Much of the secondary school curriculum demands rapid and exact recall of
facts and processes. When a student is called on in class, he or she generally
has three seconds to retrieve a response approximating the answer the teacher
requires. During tests, be it an essay test or a multiple choice/true false 
test, there is a steady need for the rapid recall of previously learned
material. While writing, when time does not allow for substantive revision
(e.g., timed exam), students must engage in simultaneous retrieval of content
knowledge and rules governing written expressions (i.e., they must quickly
recall spelling, punctuation, capitalization, vocabulary, facts, ideas and
letter formations). Some students simply cannot meet this chaUenge and exhibit
a chronic abhorrence of writing (Levine, Oberklaid, & Meltzer, 1981). Others
are delayed in mathematics because of slow or imprecise recall of the facts or
algorithms (i.e., procedures, such as how to reduce a fraction); especially
when they must recall facts and maintain the flow of the algorithms nearly
simultaneously (Levine, Lindsay, & Reed, 1992).

<p>The ultimate attainment for retrieval memory is automatization, the capacity
to recall facts or procedure: instantaneously with virtually no expenditure of
mental effort. Some secondary school students are simply poorly automated;
nothing at all is automatically accessible from memory. If reading decoding is
not automatic for a secondary school student his comprehension suffers badly.
When math facts or computational rules are not automatic, it is hard to
succeed in algebra.

<p><b>Poor Pattern Recognition</b><br>
There are some students who have trouble recognizing the patters that keep
recurring within a subject area. They have trouble identifying themes or
processes that keep re-appearing over an academic year, or within a particular
subject domain. To them, information and class work appears fragmented and
lacking in cohesion. For example, in mathematics it may be hard for them to
read a word problem and recognize a pattern within the language of the problem
that should cue a particular process. In reading, these students fail to
recognize a theme, image, or character trait that emerges repeatedly in
various guises or contexts. Such weaknesses of pattern recognition memory
ultimately take their toll on academic performance at the same time that they
diminish significantly the likelihood that a student will find the content of
school particularly interesting.

<p>Embedded within the dysfunctions of memory is the ever present role of
attention. At any age, but possibly more so in adolescence, attention and
memory can interact to potentiate more insidious forms of learning disorders.
Are the learning problems manifested in class attributable only to attention
deficits? To only memory deficits? Or are the attention deficits undermining a
student's memory capacity or vice versa?

<hr width="75%">

<h3><a name="5"></a>The Phenomena Associated With Superficial Understanding</h3>

<p>Adolescents with learning disorders may proceed through secondary education in
a state of mild to moderate, and sometimes even severe, confusion. These are
students who have trouble grasping and building cognitive bridges between the
facts, ideas, concepts, an procedures learned within and across content areas.
Those who appear to gain only a surface level Understanding of information may
possess hidden language deficits, poor higher-order cognitive skills,
including weak formation of concepts and an over reliance on top-down
processing, or they may be passive in their approach to learning.

<p><b>Adolescents With Poor Language Processing</b><br>
The academic demands for verbal comprehension, verbal reasoning, and verbal
expression explode in volume, density, complexity, and abstractness during
students' transition from early adolescence to adolescence (Montgomery, 1992).
Teenagers with language deficits can manifest gaps in a number of processes
and abilities assumed to be in place by secondary school.

<p>Adolescents with poor language processing may have difficulty following
complex instructions and interpreting extended verbal explanations (i.e.,
lectures). They commonly harbor basic weaknesses in semantics, sentence
processing, and/or the capacity to deal with large chunks of language
discourse. These students may reveal delays in their reading comprehension,
major difficulties in foreign language acquisition, problems as well in the
verbal aspects of mathematics, including the deciphering of word problems and
the mastery of technical vocabulary (Levine et al., 1992). They are prone to
serious problems in courses that rely heavily on reading for content (such as
history).

<p>There are some adolescents who can process language adequately but at a slow
pace; they have trouble &quot;keeping up&quot; with the rapid constant onslaught of
verbal communication in the classroom. Additionally, many of these students
have a weak metalinguistic sense, an incomplete understanding of how language
works. They are apt to be confused over parts of speech, grammatical
construction, and other formal features of language. In secondary schools
there is a heightened need for students to be able to process abstract
figurative language, to comprehend textbooks containing densely packed
verbally encoded ideas, m use verbal reasoning skills, and to learn a foreign
language (Levine & Reed 1992). The critical role of language progression
during adolescence is poorly appreciated. There exists a dearth of appropriate
diagnostic tools and a lack of well trained professionals with a background in
adolescent language development (both normal and dysfunctional). Moreover,
research into the language disabilities of secondary school students has been
sparse.

<p><b>Adolescents With Incomplete Conceptualization</b><br>
Concepts are broad ideas that categorize the phenomena that keep recurring in
any subject area. Examples include: &quot;balanced equation&quot; in mathematics;
&quot;photosynthesis&quot; in science; &quot;right wing&quot; in a social studies class;
&quot;conjugation&quot; in a foreign language; and &quot;sonata form&quot; in a music class. Some
students struggle in vain with the concepts in one or more secondary school
subject areas. In particular, they are likely to have trouble with the
ever-growing array of abstract concepts, those concepts that do not contain
any direct sensory references. Such students are often described by their
teachers as overly &quot;concrete.&quot; Their conceptual understanding is incomplete or
tenuous - They may over-rely on prototypes, believing (or hoping) that if they
can cite an example, they must understand the concept. A student might know
that the United States is a democracy without really grasping the components
of government that constitute the concept of &quot;democracy.&quot; In mathematics, a
student may over-rely on rote memory, deploying a so-called &quot;algorithmic
approach&quot; to problem solving. She or he may be able to solve equations without
really knowing what equations are. Such tenuous grasping inevitably leads to
academic deterioration.

<p><b>Adolescents With Extreme Top-Down Processing</b><br>
Students who are extreme in their top-down processing are often very creative
and imaginative. However, they have difficulty focusing on relevant details.
They keep imposing or superimposing their own ideas, rich associations, and
values over what they are hearing, observing, reading, or discussing.
Adolescents who over rely on top-down processing are likely to have difficulty
in highly convergent subject domains, those courses where there tends to be
only one correct answer to a question or only a single acceptable
interpretation of a situation. These adolescents often do poorly on multiple
choice tests and can be very distressed when they receive their SAT scores.

<p><b>Adolescents With Passive Learning Approaches</b><br>
Some adolescents are conspicuously inactive in their approach to learning.
Within the classroom their minds seem to be inert. They fail to associate new
information with what they already know. They tend to be non-elaborative in
their thinking and speaking in school. Very little intellectual content is of
any interest to them. Their understanding is constricted, and they tend to
equate learning with memorization. Some of these students with passive
learning approaches may show attentional dysfunction as well; that is, they
seem to have too little mental energy to partake actively in the learning
process.

<hr width="75%">


<h3><a name="6"></a>The Phenomena Associated With Reduced Or Inefficient Output</h3>

<p>The expectations of secondary school curriculum demand ever increasing
quantities of self-directed academic productivity. Adolescents must not only
learn to learn, they must also work and learn to work! The demands of output
include increasing amounts of a wide-range of writing genres, such as
argumentative/persuasive essays, compare and contrast formats, original works
of fiction and non-fiction, each emphasizing students' ability to analyze,
synthesize, and evaluate differing perspectives about history, literature, and
culture. These important higher-order cognitive functions can stress the still
developing or yet-to-be developed systems, that comprise students' attentional
strength, memory capacity, comprehension level, problem-solving facility,
organizational function abilities, etc. This section will describe these
common developmental output demands placed on adolescents.

<p><b>Written Output Failure</b><br>
There may be no more complex school-related activity than writing (Levine,
1987). The myriad of interdependent and recursive cognitive processes and
sub-processes required to represent knowledge on paper (see Flower & Hayes,
1981; Hayes & Flower, 1986; Levine et al., 1993; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986)
may make it the most cognitively expensive performance-based task; yet it is
the single most commonly used activity to evaluate competence in secondary
schools, if not at all grade levels. Presently, schools are adopting
performance based assessment tests comprised of open-ended items that students
respond to by &quot;thinking on paper,&quot; where generating a product (correct answer)
is not weighed as heavily as the process (procedures, thought processes) used
to arrive at the product. Such forms of evaluation will no doubt discriminate
against students with &quot;output problems&quot;' by underestimating their competency.
These adolescents often can partake of activities requiring high-order
thinking skills, but they may need to express these skills through
non-traditional means, such as producing a piece of art work that captures the
essence of a poem instead of a written essay that reflects an interpretation
of the poem.

<p>Developmental written output failure can be associated with various underlying
dysfunctions. Students whose writing is labored, slow, and poorly legible may
have graphomotor dysfunction which manifests itself in various forms of fine
motor incoordination during writing that make it difficult for their fingers
to keep pace with the flow of their ideas (Levine, et al, 1981). The effort of
transcribing thoughts to paper can functionally undermine thinking and the use
of sophisticated language during the writing process (Levine et al., 1993).
Written output failures are also exhibited by students with memory
dysfunctions (see above), language difficulties (see below), and
organizational problems (see below). In addition, the higher-order deficits,
such as in problem-solving ability, social cognition, planning and revising
strategies, can make it difficult for students to select topics and produce
coherent and cohesive text (Hayes & Flower, 1986). Disorders of written output
can have a profound psychological effect on an adolescent who is prone to
become discouraged and anxious about performance in school - perhaps so
anxious about school performance as to cease being productive at all.

<p><b>Expressive Language Dysfunction</b><br>
There are many students who have difficulty meeting the high expectations for
expressive language fluency (of which written output is one form). Many
language processing activities require the apportionment of capacity from
different cognitive processes (Montgomery, 1992). Classroom teachers can
recognize adolescents who may have expressive language dysfunction by
observing students who have difficulty communicating their ideas during class
discussions, on paper, or both. These adolescents are at-risk for academic and
social problems (Montgomery, 1992). Montgomery (1992) stated that research
results are mixed as to delineating causal mechanisms underlying language
impairments in adolescents. Deficits in expressive language have been
associated with difficulties in social conversational abilities, word
retrieval during conversation and written expression, and the cohesiveness and
coherence of narrative text. Affected students may live in constant
apprehension over the prospect of being called upon in class!

<p><b>Organizational Problems</b><br>
Secondary schools require adolescents to be extremely efficient and effective
organizers of time and  materials; textbooks, homework, pencils, papers, pens
must all arrive at 6-7 different classrooms at the appointed times to be used
in classes led by teachers with different expectations for performance and
behavior. Adolescents can have temporal-sequential deficits, or an inability
to estimate, allocate, stage, and monitor progress towards completion of
activities, that undermine efficient management of time. Many adolescents with
temporal sequential deficits have trouble making use of stepwise approaches to
task completion; they try to think of what to do as they are in the process of
completing a task. Instead, students need to plan or preview what the final
product may look like, generate multiple alternative strategies that could be
used to complete the task, select one strategy, start the task, monitor
progress and quality of the product, and modify the strategy or select another
when it is no longer facilitating goal attainment. Adolescents can often
benefit from an adult or a peer who will provide &quot;expert scaffolding,&quot; or the
provision of help, for the purpose of structuring the timing and sequencing of
activities (see Palinscar & Brown, 1984). The goal should be to model these
covert cognitive processes as approached for the student to utilize
him/herself during problem-solving tasks.

<p>Other students will experience problems organizing materials for school.
Notebooks, desks at home, lockers, assignment journals, and other &quot;props&quot; are
simply difficult to manage. These students &quot;lose&quot; many possessions, have
difficulty knowing and/or organizing materials to take home or bring back to
school, and surround themselves with hopelessly disorganized work areas and
lockers.

<h3><a name="7"></a>Summary</h3>

<p>Some phenomena that impair learning and attention in adolescents have been
presented in a compartmentalized, linear fashion. In reality these phenomena
associated with negative school-related outcomes never operate in isolation.
Importantly from a developmental perspective, all cognitive processes are
highly interdependent and can influence each other's development and
refinement. For example, an early adolescent may possess attentional strengths
but weak memory capacity during middle school that over time functionally
undermines existent attentional strength. This student's inability to continue
to use developed attentional processes during middle school may result in weak
attentional strength and reduced memory capacity in high school. In fact, by
the time students reach secondary school-age it may be very difficult, if not
futile, to identify single dimensions of cognition that cause learning
problems. That is, is a student's negative performance related only to
deficits in attention, memory, language, or a combination of two, or a
combination of these? Furthermore, a unitary explanation for learning and
attention deficits implies a single treatment strategy.

<p><b>Management</b><br>
What are teachers, parents, and adolescents left to do regarding the
management of the phenomena underlying underachievement given the complexity
of these learning and attentional disorders and the limitations of
standardized tests for illuminating subtle and sometimes hidden learning
problems? First, the phenomenological approach to learning disorders requires
teachers to be well-educated in adolescent cognitive and social development.
Teachers need to be keen developmentalists especially about the phenomena
relating to areas such as attention, memory, language, higher-order cognition,
and output. Second, well-educated teachers should apply this knowledge using
observational tools to record prospectively relevant dimensions of
performance. Additionally, teachers should engage their knowledge in skillful
analyses of students' error patterns. Teachers can gather their evidence,
including reports from the parent(s) and the student, and draw inferences
regarding the functional status of a struggling adolescent. Third, teacher(s),
parents and students need to collaborate in a process of formulating,
monitoring, and evaluating the effectiveness of educational management
techniques that lead to academic achievement, social skill development, and
enhanced self-concept. Optimal management must include &quot;demystification&quot; of
the phenomena associated with negative school-related outcomes and may include
use of accommodations that &quot;by-pass&quot; the problematic areas and/or direct
cognitive interventions that instruct students about the covert processes
underlying school-related outcomes.

<p><B>Demystification Of The Phenomena</b><br>
Educating students about their learning strengths, weaknesses, and affinities
is based on the premise that students must begin to understand the mysterious
processes underlying learning and the nature of their differences as a
precondition of intervention. Students' inclusion in the process of management
grows in importance as they grow older; it is futile to attempt to intervene
in this age range if adolescents do not have a firm grasp on the nature of
their cognitive assets and shortcomings (Levine, 1993).
The purpose of demystification is to educate students about their own unique
patterns of ability using non-threatening, non-moralistic, and jargon-free
vocabulary and examples. It is hoped that such teaching can relieve students
of negative attributions for their success and failure in the classroom and
fantasies (&quot;I'm dumb!&quot;) about themselves commonly associated with low self-
esteem, feelings of hopelessness, and loss of motivation in children and
adolescents with learning and attentional disorders (Borkowski, Weyhing, &
Carr, 1988; Sabatino, 1982; Swartz, Purdy, & Fullingim, 1983).

<p><b>Accommodating To The Phenomena</b><br>
One component of the educational management plan may be the 
formulation of &quot;by-pass&quot; techniques. The purpose of using 
by-pass techniques is to change the nature of tasks to minimize the 
negative impact of inadequately developed cognitive processes 
underlying school-related outcomes (i.e., long division, writing). 
Such techniques demand flexibility and compassion on the part of
teachers. Generally, accommodations take the following forms: 
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 
<dd>rate adjustment, or modifying the speed in which information is 
taken in and the speed in which output is expected to be produced; 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<dd>volume adjustment. or modifying the ideational density of 
information taken in or amount expected to be produced; 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<dd>complexity adjustment, or modifying the number of steps to be 
remembered within a procedure, reducing the linguistic demands of 
instruction; and 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
<dd>devices, or the use of props (i.e., calculators, word processors).
</dl>
Instructional decisions regarding the use of accommodations, individually or
in combination with others, is a function of the student's profile of
neurodevelopmental strengths and weaknesses and the teacher's understanding of
their interactions with components of specific tasks.

<p>An adolescent who produces very little written output on paper, but who is
very eloquent and sophisticated in her verbal output during discussions, may
benefit from &quot;writing her paper&quot; on a tape recorder and then transcribing it
to paper. If this by-pass technique is not possible, the teacher can reduce
the complexity of the writing task by encouraging the student to write the
initial draft of her paper without regard to spelling, punctuation, and
grammatical structure of the sentences and paragraphs. The teacher will then
evaluate only the quality of the ideas contained in the initial draft; the
teacher will evaluate other mechanical aspects of the essay in later drafts.
This process may require the teacher to make adjustments in her expectations
for when the student will turn in the final paper. But, the teacher will be
evaluating an essay that more closely approximates this student's competence.

<p><b>Interventions To Strengthen Weaknesses</b><br>
Intervention research with children and adolescents with learning and
attentional disorders has had a mixed history. Kavale (1990, 1993) laments the
past shortcomings of intervention research because &quot;... little agreement has
emerged about the value of an intervention much less insight in how and why it
works&quot; (p.6 [Kavale, 1990]). Teachers do not know which students will benefit
from participation in intensive intervention programs. This problem is
primarily due to researchers who provide inadequate descriptions of the
samples of students they are studying and the lack of well-controlled
experimental settings. The former limits generalizability of findings to
individual students while the latter limits transferability of teaching
strategies to classrooms.

<p>Regardless of such a less than optimistic perspective on the effectiveness of
direct interventions and intervention research, a growing empirical knowledge
base suggests that students with learning and attentional disorders can
benefit from direct instruction in the covert cognitive processes (such as
strategy use) underlying many school-related outcomes (i.e. , reading
comprehension, narrative story writing). The purpose of direct interventions
is to improve students' self-regulation of information processing, behavior,
and personal relationships. For example, a student with developmental written
output failure may possess relatively intact attention, memory, language
skills, and higher-order cognition based on his teacher's classroom
observations, analyses of error patterns, and student self-reports. The
student's weakness may lie in his tenuous understanding of the writing process
(planning, translating, reviewing) and/or how his unique neurodevelopmental
profile of strengths and weaknesses interacts with writing tasks (e. g. ,
interaction between active working memory and transcribing ideas at the same
time he is trying to use rules of syntax).

<p>The adolescent student may benefit from direct instruction in the writing
process through a cognitive behavioral writing intervention. The purpose of
the intervention is to improve the student's knowledge and skillful use of
planning strategies (idea generation and organization), decisions about the
time line for translating ideas into sentences and paragraphs (initially
attending to meaning then attending to other text features such as
punctuation, spelling and grammar), and reviewing strategies (evaluating the
cohesiveness and coherence of the text, comprehensibility of the text, and
revision strategies that improve the quality of the essay).

<p>First, the teacher needs to demystify the student about his profile of
strengths and weaknesses and then introduce the writing strategy. Second, the
teacher should make covert thought processes underlying the writing process
overt by verbalizing his thoughts and decisions during his modeling of how to
write an essay. Initially, the student is likely to overtly verbalize his
thoughts and decisions and over time subvocalize his writing strategies.
Finally, the student should self-regulate the writing process with no overt
behavior. Depending on the status of the student, this process may take weeks,
months, or the whole school year.

<p><b>Conservation Of Adolescents</b><br>
A byproduct of a phenomenological perspective for recognizing and managing
adolescent underachievement has at the core of its philosophy the conservation
of individual variation among students. It assumes that all adolescents want
to succeed in high school and that they want to be successful adults. It is
important to recognize that the abilities needed for success as an adult
differ markedly from those functions that are requisites for accomplished
performance in secondary school. Moreover, the adult world values and needs
diverse kinds of minds. We must overcome the irrational drive to homogenize
young people. Teachers, parents, clinicians and policy makers must strive to
preserve developmental differences rather than to punish or discriminate
against them by imposing needlessly rigid expectations during a critical
period when maturing nervous systems are working overtime to define their
individuality.
