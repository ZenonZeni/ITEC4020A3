<H2>MOOD DISORDERS: DEPRESSION &amp; . . .</H2>
<hr>

Mood Disorders: Depression &amp; Manic Depression
<P>
"Recurrent mood disorders," "major affective disorder," "major
depression," and "manic depressive illness" are terms used to
describe the most common group of serious psychiatric conditions.
<P>
These conditions involve periodic disturbances in mood,
concentration, sleep, activity, appetite, and social behavior. In
the United States alone more than 20 million people will
experience a mood disorder during their lifetime. Many cases,
unfortunately, go unrecognized and untreated.
<P>
The most common types of these illnesses are: Major depression
(non-bipolar or unipolar), Bipolar disorder (manic depression)
<P>
In the last 10 years much time and energy have been spent by
medical researchers to understand better these disorders and to
find more effective means of treating them.
<P>
Modern treatments are effective and safe and usually allow
persons with a recurrent mood disorder to live useful and
productive lives.
<P>
This pamphlet was prepared to help explain the course of these
disorders, how they may affect one's life, and how they can be
treated.
<P>
What is "affective disorder"?
<P>
The term "affect" refers to one's mood or "spirits." "Affective
disorder" refers to changes in mood that occur during an episode
of illness marked by extreme sadness (depression) or excitement
(mania) or both.
<P>
"Mania" describes periods of abnormal elation and increased
activity while "depression" describes an abnormal degree of
sadness and melancholy. The same person may have periods of mania
and depression.
<P>
Occasionally, the disease presents a combination of manic and
depressive symptoms. If untreated, these episodes tend to recur
or persist throughout life.
<P>
What are the symptoms?
<P>
The most common symptoms are changes in sleep pattern, level of
daily activity and energy, appetite, mood, self-esteem, thinking,
speech, sex drive, and interpersonal relations.
<P>
In periods of excitement (hypomania) an exaggerated sense of
well-being (euphoria) or irritability may be experienced. The
rate of thinking is markedly increased.
<P>
Intellectual activity takes place with lightning speed, and there
is great frustration with family and friends who do not
immediately accept or become engaged with such "flights of
ideas."
<P>
During a period of depression there may be persistent feelings of
sadness and emptiness, tearfulness for no apparent reason, or
irritability and hostility toward others.
<P>
Mental speed and activity are usually lowered; ideas are fewer.
There is a poverty of thought, and responses to the environment
are painfully slowed.
<P>
Family members may be surprised by dramatic changes in mood that
seem to have no obvious association with life events.
<P>
Although nearly everyone experiences periods of sadness as well
as periods of well being, people with affective disorders during
an episode of illness experience these emotions to an extreme
degree.
<P>
There are two basic types of episodes -- periods of depression
and periods of mania.
<P>
Periods of depression are characterized by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Poor appetite and weight loss or the opposite, increased appetite and weight gain
<LI>--  Sleep disturbance: sleeping too little or sleeping too much in an irregular pattern
<LI>--  Loss of energy: excessive fatigue or tiredness
<LI>--  Change in activity level, either increased or decreased
<LI>--  Loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities
<LI>--  Decreased sexual drive
<LI>--  Diminished ability to think or concentrate
<LI>--  Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt which may reach grossly unreasonable (delusional) proportions
<LI>--  Recurrent thoughts of death or self harm, wishing to be dead or contemplating or attempting suicide
</UL>

<P>
Periods of hypomania or the more severe state of mania are
characterized by:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  Persistently "high" (euphoric) or irritable mood states
<LI>--  Appetite disturbance
<LI>--  Decreased need for sleep
<LI>--  Increased activity
<LI>--  Increased sexuality
<LI>--  Pressured speech
<LI>--  Racing thoughts
<LI>--  Loss of self-control and judgment
</UL>

<P>
In the bipolar or manic-depressive form of affective disorder,
both depressive and manic cycles occur. Usually a period of
depression follows a period of hypomania or mania, or the
reverse. Sometimes they are separated by periods of normal or
near normal functioning.
<P>
Does it go away?
<P>
The onset of the first episode of an affective disorder may not
be obvious. Some people have infrequent brief, mild episodes do
not seek treatment or even recognize that they are ill. 
<P>
Typically, episodes of illness are time-limited: they come and
go, last from several days to several months, and are followed by
relatively normal periods of mood behavior.
<P>
Without treatment, the frequency of illness, as well as the
severity of symptoms, tends to increase over the years. Less
often, a person may have only rare episodes of illness.
<P>
Manic and depressive episodes present differently in different
persons, and there are even differences in one person from one
episode to the next.
<P>
Does being depressed change feelings about oneself?
<P>
Mood has a strong influence on what one thinks from moment to
moment. During periods of depression one often dwells on memories
of losses or failures.
<P>
Negative thoughts may take over, such as: "I can't be worth
much," "No one really cares about me," "The world is terrible,"
or "My parents hate me."
<P>
Since these episodes may last for several months or longer, one's
morale or self esteem may become seriously impaired. Prolonged
periods of depression can lead to the wish to die or even to
thoughts of killing oneself.
<P>
If one goes through cycles of being "up," does that change the
way one things and feels about oneself?
<P>
Many individuals who have experienced the "highs" of
manic-depressive illness describe feeling better than at any
other time of their life.
<P>
They cannot understand why anyone would call their experience
abnormal or part of an illness. They feel excited, have surges of
energy, describe feeling more creative, active, more intelligent,
more sexual, able to accomplish things they never thought
possible. Sleep seems unnecessary. Life plans and decisions are
often out of proportion with the individual's realistic abilities
and resources.
<P>
Thus, the "high" periods of hypomania and mania can leave a false
sense of one's abilities that may be difficult to give up. They
may be followed by crashing into despondency after the "high" has
run its course.
<P>
Decisions made during these periods are typically impulsive and
reckless. Spending sprees and other indiscretions (sexual,
alcoholic, etc.) are common.
<P>
These periods of feeling great exaltation, self-importance and
power can cause confusion and loss of contact with reality --
often more obvious to others than to the person experiencing
this elated mood state.
<P>
This unrealistic euphoria seems to be a common cause of not
complying with recommended treatment -- a lapse that can,
unfortunately, lead to recurrent and incapacitating illness.
<P>
What is the usual outcome of a mood disorder?
<P>
More than 75 percent of individuals with the illness respond well
to medical treatment; nearly all patients respond at least
partly.
<P>
Most individuals who seek treatment and follow the
recommendations of their doctor can lead productive, useful, and
reasonably stable and satisfying lives.
<P>
Without proper medical treatment, many such persons suffer
repeated periods of illness, hospitalization, and loss of
productive living.
<P>
What are the treatments for mood disorders?
<P>
Mood disorders are medical illnesses that produce emotional
symptoms. A common-sense treatment plan involves treating the
medical symptoms as well as learning how to recognize one's own
patterns of illness and developing ways of coping with them.
<P>
In addition to taking the medication prescribed by the doctor,
many patients and their families find it helpful to obtain
supportive counseling.
<P>
Treatment is directed at lessening the duration and intensity of
the episodes and preventing recurrences. It is helpful to have
accurate records of the intensity and duration of past episodes
to provide comparisons for current treatment efforts and to
determine whether there is a regular seasonal vulnerability.
<P>
What medication is taken for bipolar disorder?
<P>
The medication lithium carbonate was introduced for the treatment
of mania and bipolar affective disorder in the early 1950's. It
has a powerful mood stabilizing effect and can be used safely. It
is not a sedative, but prevents extremes of mood, either high or
low.
<P>
Lithium's main benefit lies in the prevention of episodes and in
treating an episode after it has occurred. Manic and depressive
attacks occur less frequently and are less severe when lithium is
taken regularly.
<P>
Individuals with recurring manic depressive (bipolar) and some
forms of recurring depressive (unipolar) illness are often
treated with lithium. When taken regularly and at a correct
dosage, there is no sedation or other effects on awareness or
mental functioning.
<P>
What medical tests are needed before on starts taking lithium?
<P>
A medical evaluation including medical history, physical
examination, and simple laboratory tests of blood and urine are
needed.
<P>
Because lithium is almost entirely eliminated from the body by
the kidneys, laboratory tests of kidney function are done before
starting lithium and at regular intervals thereafter.
<P>
Tests of thyroid function are also advised since lithium may
occasionally cause goiter (a harmless, treatable enlargement of
the thyroid gland) or a mild decrease in thyroid function
(hypothyroidism). A blood test of the level of thyroid hormones
is usually done at regular intervals.
<P>
How is a lithium dosage determined?
<P>
There is a simple, inexpensive blood test to measure the level of
lithium in the blood, so the correct dosage can be precisely
determined for each patient.
<P>
Initially lithium levels are checked every few days (taking a
blood sample about 12 hours after the last evening dose). Once
the correct blood lithium level is reached, lithium levels
typically are measured monthly or less often. The day of a blood
test, no lithium should be taken until after the test.
<P>
How long will one need to take lithium?
<P>
Whether a person should remain on long-term therapy after an
episode has ended depends on many individual factors.
<P>
It is a decision requiring close cooperation and discussion
between a medical specialist, the individual, and the family.
<P>
Many individuals need not be on long-term lithium treatment.
Treating someone for a mild illness or one that is not likely to
recur for many years, if ever, unnecessarily exposes him to all
the potential risks and expenses that come with prolonged use of
any drug.
<P>
Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to predict with confidence
who will fall into this more favorable group.
<P>
Some individuals may have only a single episode of affective
illness. How long someone remains on lithium following a single
episode of mania or hypomania involves a careful individual
decision, usually based on the previous severity, duration, and
pattern of recurrence of illness in the patient.
<P>
If episodes are minor or widely separated, long-term medication
may not be necessary. It is usually best to continue treatment
for at least a few months after recovery from an acute episode of
mania, especially if it is severe enough to require
hospitalization. Those with more severe and frequent episodes
will likely need to take lithium indefinitely.
<P>
What kinds of lithium preparations are available?
<P>
Several preparations of lithium are available. Most are simple
300 mg lithium carbonate tablets or capsules. Others are in
slow-release form, and a liquid preparation of lithium citrate is
sometimes used.
<P>
The choice of lithium preparations is based on individual
preference and cost. Capsules are sometimes preferred because
tablets may have an unpleasant taste. When it is necessary to
regulate the dose in 150 mg rather that 300 mg increments, scored
tablets or liquid preparations are used.
<P>
Individual requirements for lithium vary consider ably. Some
patients take 900 mg or 1200 mg of lithium carbonate in a single
dose without distress, while others require several small doses
of 150 mg to 300 mg over the course of the day.
<P>
What are the side effects of lithium? Can they be prevented?
<P>
Lithium is non-sedating and side effects are rare. It is not
addicting. It is safe at appropriate dosages, although when taken
in excess it can produce intoxication and potentially dangerous
side effects.
<P>
While common, most side effects are both harm less and easily
dealt with. Stopping treatment is rarely necessary.
<P>
The following early side-effects are common and usually subside
in several days:
<P>
--  Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
stomach ache (such side effects can usually be alleviated through
adjustments of dosage and timing of administration.
<P>
Simple changes, such as taking few tablets or capsules at one
time, taking them on a full stomach, or with a glass of milk, are
often effective.)
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  Hand tremor
<LI>--  Fine tremor of the hands at rest (It usually be gins early in treatment, although it may appear at any time, may vary, and may or may not go away over time.)
<LI>--  Thirst and frequent urination
<LI>--  Fatigue, a dazed feeling, muscle weakness
</UL>

Late side effects include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>--  Hand tremor (Individuals inconvenienced by continued tremor beyond the first weeks of treatment should seek relief of the condition without interrupting their treatment. In consultation with physician, a lower dose may prove effective. If this is not possible, the addition of small doses of propranolol (Inderal) often produces a beneficial effect.)
<LI>--  Severe thirst and frequent urination (These symptoms may be reversed by waiting a few weeks, lowering the dose of lithium, or by careful use of a thiazide diuretic (water pill) such as Diuril, under doctor's supervision.)
<LI>--  Urinary incontinence (This may occur in some women. It can usually be helped by decreasing the dose of lithium or adding other medicine (with anticholinergic action) under a doctor's advice.)
</UL>
<P>

These common side effects of lithium therapy occur in perhaps 40
percent of those using this medicine. Symptoms usually begin
early in treatment, although they may appear for the first time
after months or even years of treatment.
<P>
Although they may not pose a great concern, they should be
promptly reported because they may signal a change in the level
of lithium in the blood.
<P>
What are the dangers of taking too much lithium?
<P>
With the exception of single large overdosages, lithium poisoning
or intoxication is usually of gradual onset. The signs of
beginning lithium intoxication include loss of appetite, vomiting
and diarrhea, fatigue, weakness, unsteadiness, slurred speech,
muscle twitching, and severe shakiness.
<P>
Although poisoning is rare with careful medical supervision, it
is important to be aware of these symptoms and to recognize them.
<P>
Severe intoxication or poisoning can lead to seizures, confusion,
coma, and possibly death. Clearly, the daily lithium intake must
not be increased without consulting the doctor.
<P>
What about taking other medications while on lithium?
<P>
Those receiving lithium, especially for the long term, may need
to take other medication at some time. Other drugs may be used to
supplement lithium in treating a mood disorder, or they may be
used coincidentally with lithium to treat unrelated medical
conditions.
<P>
Lithium and diuretics (water pills for high blood pressure): The
elimination of lithium from the body is linked to removal of
sodium by the kidneys.
<P>
Most diuretic drugs (water pills) alter this excretion pattern of
both sodium and lithium. A decrease in dietary sodium intake can
result in a potentially dangerous increase in lithium in the
blood.
<P>
Dietary extremes of sodium (salt) intake should be avoided. Low
salt diets, especially when combined with water pills, can result
in lithium retention to the point of intoxication.
<P>
Most diuretics get rid of sodium from the body and can cause
retention of lithium. Since these drugs are usually prescribed by
general physicians or internists, it is important that patients
and their doctors be aware of this interaction.
<P>
Lithium need not be stopped when diuretic drugs are used but the
lithium dose will almost certainly have to be lowered to maintain
serum levels of lithium in a safe, therapeutic range.
<P>
Lithium and Antipsychotic Medicines: Lithium is sometimes used
together with major tranquilizers (such as Mellaril, Thorazine,
Prolixin, Haldol, and Navane), or benzodiazepines -- Valium-like
drugs -- (Klonopin and Ativan) especially in the initial phase of
treatment of acute mania. These two classes of drugs have been
safely used together for years in thousands of patients.
<P>
Are there reasons not to take lithium?
<P>
Lithium may be harmful to a developing fetus. Every effort should
be make to avoid taking lithium during early pregnancy.
<P>
Women planning to get pregnant or who become pregnant while
taking lithium, should tell their doctor immediately so lithium
can be stopped. Similarly, a mother should not breast teed her
baby it she is taking lithium.
<P>
It a doctor advises that it is not sate to stop lithium during
pregnancy, the dose should be the smallest possible to provide a
low but therapeutic level.
<P>
Because of changes in the way the body deals with lithium during
pregnancy and at delivery, serum determination of lithium is best
checked frequently. Wide fluctuations in the mother's blood
lithium concentration are best avoided by use of repeated small
doses.
<P>
Some patients may be unable to take lithium because of side
effects or medical contraindications. For others, lithium may be
ineffective or may produce an incomplete response. There are
alternatives for these individuals.
<P>
Studies completed in the past few years in Japan and the U.S.
show that two drugs introduced for the treatment of epilepsy,
carbamazepine (Tegretol) and valproic acid (Depakene) can be
effective for acute mania, perhaps have antidepressant properties
and work to prevent future episodes.
<P>
A number of patients who failed to respond to carbamazepine
alone have responded well to a combination of lithium and
carbamazepine.
<P>
What are treatments for major depression?
<P>
For individuals who have infrequent or recurrent periods of
depression only, anti-depressant medication is effective.
Research shows that medication coupled with supportive counseling
provides the most effective treatment.
<P>
Some depressed patients have only one episode of major depression
and never relapse. In such cases, long-term anti-depressant use
would not be necessary.
<P>
Who should have continued drug treatment has not been defined
exactly. The number of depressive episodes and their severity
help decide the benefits and risks.
<P>
Lithium seems to prevent relapses of recurrent depression in some
unipolar patients. Electroconvulsive therapy may be effective in
serious cases resistant to other treatments.
<P>
Recent clinical experiences sounds a cautionary note for bipolar
patients using tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase
inhibitors during their depressions. For some, their use may induce
hypomania or mania, and over time the frequency of cycles may be
increased. Careful monitoring and restricted use for limited periods
of time in bipolar patients is indicated.
<P>
Several types of drugs are used in the treatment of acute or
recurrent depression. All share similar beneficial side effects,
but may have different side effects.
<P>
The usual daily oral dosage for a typical antidepressant
(Imipramine, Tofranil, and others) is about 150 to 300 mg. For
most age groups, antidepressants may be taken safely at one time,
usually at bedtime. Antidepressants typically take effect slowly.
<P>
It may take 3 to 4 weeks or longer for the relief of some
symptoms of depression (especially low energy and depressed or
irritable mood) while insomnia may improve within a few days. 
<P>
Sometimes patients think that the medicine is not helping if they
don't feel better immediately, but they should keep taking it for
at least several weeks at an adequate blood level.
<P>
Some of the most commonly prescribed preparations of the most
common type of antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants) are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Amitriptyline (Amitril, Amitriptyline, Elavil, Endep)
<LI>-- Desipramine (Pertofrane; Norpramine)
<LI>-- Doxepin (Sinequan)
<LI>-- Imipramine (Antipress, Imavate, Imipramine, Presanubem SK-Praamine, Tofranil)
<LI>-- Nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor)
<LI>-- Protriptyline (Vivactyl)
</UL>

<P>
What are the side effects of antidepressants?
<P>
Before starting antidepressant treatment, a doctor should explain
the possible side effects of the prescribed antidepressant. If
not, ask about them! The most common are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Dry mouth
<LI>-- Blurred vision
<LI>-- Sweating
<LI>-- Dizziness when moving from a sitting to a standing position, sedation or over-stimulation
<LI>-- Difficulty urinating; constipation
<LI>-- Rapid pulse, or rarely, irregular heart rhythms
<LI>-- Tremor
<LI>-- Weight gain
</UL>

<P>
These side effects often decrease with time, or can be diminished
by lowering the dosage or changing to another antidepressant.
<P>
Are there other kinds of antidepressants?
<P>
Some studies have shown that monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors
are effective in individuals who have "atypical" depressions with
marked anxiety, hypersomnia, and craving for sweets, who may have
accompanying preoccupation with their health (hypochondriasis),
irritability, agoraphobia (fear of open or crowded spaces),
social phobias or lack of energy.
<P>
What are the possible side effect of MAO inhibitors?
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Postural hypotension (dizziness when standing up)
<LI>-- Headaches
<LI>-- Flushing
<LI>-- Sedation
<LI>-- Severe high blood pressure (hypertensive crisis) if certain foods, beverages, or medicines containing tyramine are taken
</UL>

<P>
What are the dietary and drug restrictions when taking MAO
inhibitors?
<P>
Certain foods and medicines can interact with MAO inhibitors to
produce potentially dangerous high blood pressure. These foods
are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>-- Aged cheeses (cottage cheese and cream cheese are safe)
<LI>-- Beer and wine (especially Chianti)
<LI>-- Chopped liver
<LI>-- Yeast products (e.g. Bovril used in gravies, Marmite)
<LI>-- Sour cream and yogurt
<LI>-- Broad beans (fava beans)
<LI>-- Pickled herring
<LI>-- Chocolate
<LI>-- Medicines that can produce hypertensive crisis in combination with MAO inhibitors (including stimulants and anti asthma medicines)
</UL>

<P>
These foods and medicines should be avoided. Over-the-counter
medicines (including sleeping pills and cold tablets) or any
prescribed medicines should not be used without checking with the
psychiatrist or family doctor.
<P>
Serotonin uptake inhibitors are among the newly developed
antidepressants that act selectively on a specific
neurotransmitter system.
<P>
The first antidepressant of its type to be marketed in the United
States, Flouxetine (Prozac) acts directly on the serotonergic
system, has relatively few side effects and for this reason has
become widely prescribed.
<P>
The dosage is between 20 mg to 80 mg a day, with most individuals
requiring no more than 20 mg for the relief of symptoms. Usually
3 to 5 weeks are required for antidepressant effect.
