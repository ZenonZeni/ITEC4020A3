	<b>THIS AGREEMENT</b> entered into this       day of              , 199   , by and between _________________________ ("wife") and _________________________ ("husband") and Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, P.C. ("ARHC"). <p> 


	<b>Whereas,</b> ________________________ and ________________________ being wife and husband desire to conceive a child by receiving oocyte(s) from a donor; and <p>

	<b>Whereas, </b>said parties seek the assistance of ARHC in said conception of a child; <p>

	Now, <b>Therefore,</b> in consideration of entry of this Agreement, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:<p>

	_______________________ ("wife") and ________________________ ("husband") desire to conceive a child by receiving oocyte(s) from a donor who shall remain anonymous and voluntarily give their consent and authorize ARHC, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees, successors and assigns and the In Vitro Fertilization ("IVF") program personnel and associates to perform In Vitro Fertilization-Embryo Transfer ("IVF-ET"), and the procedures necessary for IVF-ET.<p>

	________________________ (wife) agrees that the main objective of this treatment is to allow her to carry and deliver a child that she could not otherwise conceive.  The proposed medical procedures may afford her the experience of pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood by a treatment called oocyte donation.<p>

	________________________ (wife) understands that the child(ren) conceived by this method will not have her genetic material but will have that of the oocyte donor and her husband.  However, regardless of the outcome, she will be the mother of any child(ren) born to her as a result of egg donation and hereby accepts all the legal responsibilities required of such a parent.<p>

	The undersigned wife and husband understand that the sperm used in these procedures and referred to in this consent form will be obtained from (Circle appropriate source)<p>

<ul>
<li>The husband<p>
<li>An anonymous donor<p>
<li>A known donor<p>
</ul>

	If the undersigned wife and husband have requested donor semen (semen from another person) to be used to fertilize the egg(s), the wife and husband each will sign a separate document to indicate their decision and acceptance of that option, and they also indicate their decision for donor semen by initialing here: ____________________ (initials of husband and wife)<p>

	If donor sperm is selected (circle appropriate choice)<p>

<ul>
<li>Use only donor sperm.
<li>Divide the eggs between donor sperm and husband's sperm. _____% donor; _____% husband (selection of which sperm sample used for each egg will be at the discretion of the embryologist).
<li>If in the embryologist's opinion, the husband's sperm specimen is not likely to result in fertilization, use donor sperm.
<li>If no fertilization on first day using the husband's sperm, reinseminate with donor sperm.
</ul><p>
<b>PURPOSE OF PROCEDURES</b><br>

	The purpose of this Agreement and procedure is to provide a means for ARHC to assist the wife and husband to achieve pregnancy when conventional therapy has failed or is unacceptable.  Surgical and/or medical therapy has been tried with adequate periods of follow-up for pregnancy to occur after thorough evaluation of coital, male, cervical, ovulatory, ovarian, uterine, tubal and peritoneal factors.<p>

<b>REQUIREMENTS OF PARTICIPATION</b><br>

	The undersigned wife and husband understand that the following are requirements for participation in this procedure and they represent that they meet each of the requirements.<p>

<ul>
<li>They are legally married.
<li>They have a history of infertility from female or male factors or an unknown cause.
</ul><p>

	The undersigned wife and husband acknowledge and agree that their acceptance into the program and their continuing participation is at the discretion of the staff of the program.  Correspondingly, said wife and husband understand that they can withdraw from the program at any time without affecting the availability of other present or future medical care.<p>

	The undersigned wife and husband understand that insurance coverage for any or all of the above procedures may not be available, acknowledge that they have been made aware of their financial obligations and have made appropriate financial arrangements.  The undersigned wife and husband, jointly and individually, are responsible for payments on services performed regardless of whether a pregnancy is achieved.  The undersigned wife and husband understand that they are financially responsible for any other medical costs incurred through Georgia Baptist Medical Center or Paces Cryobank.<p>

	In accepting the gift of donated human eggs, the undersigned wife and husband agree and understand the following: <p>

	They will not require disclosure of the donor's name or any pertinent information that may identify the donor without the prior consent of the egg donor.<p>

<b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCEDURES</b><br>

	It is agreed by the abovenamed wife and husband that ARHC will obtain one or more eggs from a donor whom ARHC has chosen due to her desire to donate eggs to infertile women.  It is understood that the egg donor has been carefully screened by ARHC to be a suitable donor from a psychological and physical standpoint, having been tested for infectious diseases, and questioned in regard to familial genetic diseases and emotional stability. <p>

	The undersigned wife and husband understand and agree that no guarantee about the reliability of the history of the donor can be given.  It is understood that ARHC will make an effort to match the general physical characteristics of the donor with their general physical characteristics.<p>

	The undersigned wife and husband understand and agree that the IVFET procedure involves hormone injections to stimulate the egg donor's ovaries and the removal of egg(s) from the donor's ovary(ies) by a needle and the fertilization of those eggs with the husband's/donor's sperm in the laboratory.  If fertilization occurs, the pre-embryo(s) may be replaced into the wife's uterus and/or cryopreserved.<p>

	The undersigned wife and husband consent to the following surgical, medical and/or diagnostic procedures:<p>

<ul>
<li>Pre-IVF screening:  Determination by medical history, physical examination and standard infertility tests that they are candidates for this procedure;<p>

<li>Fertilization:  Placing the egg(s) and the sperm together in a suitable medium to allow fertilization.  If there is no evidence of fertilization after 72 hours of incubation, the oocytes (incompletely developed eggs) and sperm will be disposed of in an ethically-acceptable manner. <p>
<li>Micromanipulation: A procedure where either a few sperm are injected beneath the outer layer of the egg(s) or directly into the egg(s) to increase the possibility of fertilization.
<p><li>Embryo Culture:  Development of the fertilized egg(s) and preembryo formation;

<p><li>Assisted Hatching: A slit is made in the outer protective layer surrounding the fertilized egg(s) to remove fragments and to increase the possibility of implantation;

<p><li>Embryo Transfer:  Placement of the embryo(s) into the uterus by means of a small plastic tube inserted through the cervix into the uterus;

<p><li>Cryopreservation:  If there are more pre-embryos than can be safely transferred, excess preembryos can be cryopreserved, donated or discarded.  Alternatively, the physician and the couple may elect to limit the number of follicles aspirated.

<p><li>	Luteal Phase Support:  During the first two weeks after embryo transfer, additional hormonal support, including, but not limited to, Progesterone or HCG, may be administered in the form of injections, tablets or suppositories;

<p><li>	Pregnancy Testing:  Following transfer of embryo(s), blood tests may be obtained to insure normal hormone levels and to detect pregnancy.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the wife will proceed with obstetrical care through a physician of her choice, upon release from care of the IVF team.
</ul><p>
<b>SUCCESS RATE</b><br>

	From the information currently available, the undersigned wife and husband understand that the chances of obtaining a pregnancy by this procedure is approximately 40%.  They further represent that they have discussed their particular fertility factors and chances for success with their personal physician.  They acknowledge, agree and understand that neither ARHC, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their owners, doctors and the IVF program personnel and associates have made any promises or warranties regarding the success rate or results of IVF--ET or the health and characteristics of any child or children that may be conceived by the procedure.  Because IVF-ET is a relatively new procedure, insufficient data are available to express an exact success rate.  Failure to achieve a pregnancy may result from any of the following or from other reasons:<p>

	<ul>
<li>Maturation of the egg(s) may not occur, or the time of egg maturation may be misjudged, may not be predictable, may occur prior to egg retrieval or may not take place in the monitored cycle.

<p><li>	The procedure to obtain all or a number of eggs from the donor's ovary may not be successful.

<p><li>	Medical emergencies with other patients may restrict availability of the procedure room or the necessary personnel at the appropriate time for obtaining the egg(s).

<p><li>	The egg(s) obtained from the donor may not be normal.

<p><li>	The husband may be unable to provide a suitable semen specimen, or if used, the donor semen specimen may not have an adequate number of viable sperm after freezing and thawing.

<p><li>	Fertilization of the egg(s) by the sperm may not occur.

<p><li>	Cleavage or cell division of the embryo(s) may not occur or the embryo(s) may not develop normally.

<p><li>	The embryo(s) may become infected in the laboratory or a laboratory accident or equipment malfunction may result in loss or damage to the eggs, sperm or embryo(s).

<p><li>	Transfer of the embryo may not be successful.

<p><li>	Implantation of the embryo(s) in the uterus after embryo transfer or gamete transfer may not occur.

<p><li>	Even if a pregnancy is established, they understand that delivery of a child may not occur due to miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy (outside the uterus), stillbirth or other complications associated with pregnancy and delivery.
</ul><p>
<b>MICROMANIPULATION</b><br>
	Micromanipulation is used either to enhance fertilization, or  alternatively, it may be utilized to increase the chances that the pre-embryo(s) will attach to the uterus.  Microfertilization is performed immediately after the oocytes (eggs) are retrieved, or the following day if fertilization is not confirmed.  To enhance fertilization, the embryologist will choose between three different types of micromanipulation procedures; PZD involves slicing a hole in the zona pellucida or "shell" of the egg; SZI involves placing 2-4 sperm beneath this outer layer just ajacent to the inner egg membrane; ICSI, direct injection of the sperm into the egg. Each of these procedures may be chosen based on a number of factors.   No one procedure is appropriate for everyone.  Therefore, the embryologist will individualize treatment and will decide whether to perform micromanipulation and which procedure to use at his discretion.<p>

	Fertilization rates with micromanipulationmay vary between 20% and 50%.  There is also no guarantee that any of the eggs undergoing micromanipulation may fertilize or implant.  Repeat IVF with other modifications may result in similar fertilization rates.  Failure of the egg to fertilize and divide may be related to the stress of micromanipulation, egg injury or fertilization with more than one sperm.  There is no way to know which are the best sperm to choose for injection.  This may result in the selection of chromosomally abnormal sperm.  Early reports have suggested that the incidence of major chromosomal anomalies is increased 2-4 times in patients undergoing micromanipulation.  Prenatal genetic diagnosis of all resultant pregnancies is strongly recommended.  In addition, the incidence of identical twins may be increased.<p>

	If the fertilized egg demonstrates increased fragments, micromanipulation and removal of fragments may enhance attachment to the uterus.  In older patients, those with borderline FSH levels,  previous IVF failures or a thick outer layer (zona),  assisted hatching may be recommended.  <p>

	We understand that these procedures are new and all potential complications resulting from micromanipulation may not yet be known.  We understand that neither Dr. Perloe, Dr. Pyrzak, Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Paces Cryobank or Georgia Baptist Medical Center or their designees have warranted the success of this procedure or the health of any child developing from such a procedure.  We consent to any or all of the procedures described aboveand indicated below: (husband & wife signify consent by initialing each procedure and signing below.)<p>
	______partial zona dissection	<p>	
	______subzonal insertion<p>		
	______intracytoplasmic sperm injection<p>		
	______assisted hatching<p>		
<b>FINANCIAL CONSIDERATION</b><br>

	All of the professional services directly provided to the undersigned wife and husband shall be charged to them at the prevailing professional fee schedule.  These services include consultation appointments, monitoring of the success of the hormone treatment regimens including endometrial biopsy, professional fees associated with embryo replacement and monitoring of any early pregnancy, if established.<br>

	In addition, the undersigned wife and husband will be solely responsible for any and all medical costs of the egg donor resulting from any procedures, and resulting from any and all complications that may arise as a result of this treatment.<br>

	There will be a one-time fee of $1,000.00 imposed before the first donor egg treatment cycle is begun to cover the costs involved in the necessary screening and assessment of the egg donor.  In addition, the egg donor will receive a financial consideration of $1,500.00 for her direct and indirect expenses associated with participation.  This $1,500.00 shall be the  responsibility of the undersigned wife and husband as long as an egg retrieval is performed, whether or not any eggs are recovered and fertilized or pregnancy is established.<br>

	The undersigned wife and husband also understand that they are solely responsible to ARHC, Georgia Baptist Medical Center and Paces Cryobank and that the deposits are due prior to treatment of the oocyte donor.  Similarly, the undersigned wife and husband understand that these amounts may not cover all expenses and agree that they solely are responsible for all additional costs which are not paid by the oocyte donor.<p>

<b>POSSIBLE RISKS AND HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IVF-ET</b><br>

	Adverse reactions that have been reported with Estrogen, Progesterone or Lupron are: allergic sensitivity, pain, rash, swelling at the injection site, ectopic pregnancy, headache, irritability, restlessness, depression, fatigue, hot flashes, upset stomach, breast tenderness and abdominal bloating.  They understand that they should report symptoms to their physician immediately.<p>

	Blood tests may cause mild discomfort and a risk of developing a bruise or an infection at the needle site.  Discomfort may be caused by ultrasound procedures.

	Transferring the embryo into the uterus may cause discomfort and a risk of developing infection or bleeding.  In addition, there is the possibility that the early embryo(s) may implant into a fallopian tube causing an ectopic (tubal) pregnancy that usually requires surgical treatment.<p>

	Some women have experienced multiple pregnancies after multiple embryos were transferred.  The risk for multiple pregnancies after transferring three embryos is 27% for twins and 3% for triplets.<p>

	Multiple pregnancies (twins or more) carry higher than normal risks for the mother due to extra fetuses and may be associated with emotional and financial strain for the family, and prolonged hospitalization of the mother before the birth and after birth for both the mother and infants.<p>

	Mothers are at higher risk for high blood pressure, miscarriage, premature labor and delivery and other pregnancy complications.  Both the number of neonatal deaths and the number of long term handicaps are several times more frequent in multiple pregnancies than in single born infants.  This results primarily from premature delivery.<p>

	Triplet pregnancy (as well as quadruplets and quintuplets) increase the risk that delivery will be much too soon for survival of the infants.  A procedure known as selective reduction may be considered in cases where three or more gestational sacs are seen. More information about this procedure is available on a personal basis.<p>

	The Food and Drug Administration has advised that progesterone use should be avoided during pregnancy.  Synthetic progesterone has been reported to increase the risk of congenital heart malformations from 8 in 10,000 births to 15 in 10,000 births. Additional abnormalities reported include: anal blockage, abnormalities of bones, brain, spinal cord, vertebrae, kidney, esophagus and sex organs.  The progesterone injections that the wife will receive are made from natural progesterone and are chemically different from the synthetic progesterone resulting in the small risk of increased abnormalities noted above.  The natural progesterone injections are identical to that made by the woman's own body and, therefore, is unlikely to cause any bad effects to the woman or a baby if the woman becomes pregnant while using this medication.<p>

	It is possible that a fetus conceived by IVF-ET could develop some abnormality.  Three out of 100 births from spontaneous conception in fertile couples have some type of birth defect and this rate appears to be similar in births from IVF-ET.  Such abnormalities may not always result in miscarriage or be detectable by prenatal tests.  Although amniocentesis and/or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed to analyze fetal cells for chromosomal abnormalities, some defects cannot be determined by this or other tests; therefore, it is possible that an abnormal child could be born as a result of IVF-ET.  CVS is available at 9-11 weeks of gestation and amniocentesis is available for pregnant patients at 14-16 weeks of gestation.<p>

	They understand that these are new clinical procedures and that it is possible that there may as yet be unknown risks related to pregnancy achieved by this method, or to the mental or physical health of any children so produced.  They, therefore, do jointly and severally release and forever discharge ARHC, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their officers, doctors, agents, employees, successors and assigns and the IVF program personnel from any and all claims, demands, costs, expenses and loss of services incurred as a result of the physical or mental nature or character of any child or children so produced.<p>

<b>ALTERNATE FORMS OF TREATMENT</b><br>

	The undersigned wife and husband understand that if they choose not to proceed with IVF-ET, the chances of their obtaining a pregnancy at this time are low or nonexistent.  All other possible alternative procedures to enable pregnancy to occur have been explained, offered, or attempted.  They understand, however, that medical technology is constantly evolving and developments may take place in the future which might allow them to obtain a pregnancy.  They also understand that adoption through other resources may be available to them.<p> 

<b>TREATMENT DECISIONS</b><br>

	The undersigned wife and husband understand that all decisions regarding each step of the procedure involved, including fertilization and implantation, will be made by an IVF physician based on his independent medical judgment.  The undersigned wife and husband understand that the IVF physician may decide not to proceed with the procedures because of complications or possible risks, either to the donor, wife, husband or to the potential child, or because of other reasons and they agree to rely on his decisions in this regard.<p>

<b>LEGAL STATUS</b><br>

	This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia. <p> 

	The undersigned wife and husband understand that due to the relatively new nature of IVF-ET and oocyte donation, many legal issues surrounding the procedure have not been resolved and the legal status of any resulting child in terms of legitimacy or otherwise is uncertain.  It is the intent and understanding of the wife and husband that any resulting child will be their legitimate child, and they accept legal custody and responsibility for any child or children that result from this procedure.<p>

	The undersigned wife and husband, jointly and severally, accept the IVF using donor oocyte(s) and embryo transfer as their own act and acknowledge the child(ren) so produced as their own legitimate child(ren) and as the heir(s) of their bodies with all the rights and privileges accompanying such status.  The undersigned wife and husband further, jointly and severally, waive forever any right which they might have to disclaim such child or children as their heir(s).<p>

	Any and all disputes arising under or relating to this Agreement shall first be submitted in writing to ARHC for resolution and mediation.  If the parties are unable to resolve their dispute, then the parties shall submit their claim(s) to binding arbitration.  The arbitrator shall be an independent third-party arbitrator as agreed to by the parties or shall be appointed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia.  Said arbitrator, in his or her discretion, shall be authorized to award costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, to the prevailing party.<p>
<b>
MEDICAL EXPENSES</b><br>

	The undersigned wife and husband have been informed that if they should suffer any physical injury as a result of participation in this activity, necessary medical facilities are available for treatment.  The undersigned wife and husband understand, however, that they cannot expect to receive any payment for hospital expenses or any financial compensation for such an injury.
<p>
<b>CONFIDENTIALITY</b><br>

	The undersigned wife and husband understand that the physician and associates will, unless otherwise compelled by law, make all reasonable efforts to keep information obtained during the course of treatment confidential.  The undersigned wife and husband agree that specific medical details may be revealed in professional publications as long as confidentiality is maintained.  The undersigned wife and husband also authorize the filming, videotaping and/or photographing of the female reproductive organs during the course of the procedure.<p>

<b>LIMITING MULTIPLE PREGNANCY</b><br>

	We have been informed of the risks of multiple pregnancy.  After discussion of the risks of multiple pregnancy, my husband and I have decided to have:  (choose one or both)<p>
  A maximum of  ________ (number of pre-embryos) placed into my uterus. _____________________ (initials of husband and wife)  <p>

  A number of pre-embryos to be determined by the physician and the embryologist immediately prior to pre-embryo placement into the uterus so as to maximize the possibility of pregnancy and minimize the risk of multiple gestation.  We understand that a scoring system will be used to grade pre-embryo quality to indicate the number of pre-embryos to transfer.  There is no guarantee that this technique will successfully limit the chance of multiple gestations.  _____________________ (initials of husband and wife) <p> 
We have been informed and understand that if we wish to cryopreserve (freeze) any fertilized eggs not transferred to the uterus, we will be required to sign a separate consent document.  We have been informed and understand that if we, as husband and wife, cannot agree or do not consent to either the freezing of fertilized eggs or donation, we must either limit the number of eggs to be inseminated to the same number that are to be transferred to the Wife's uterus or agree to disposal of extra fertilized eggs.   If excess pre-embryos are not cryopreserved our chance of achieving a pregnancy may ultimately be decreased. (Choose one option.) <p>

<ol>
<li>We consent to cryopreserve extra pre-embryos. (separate consent required)<p>

<li>We do not wish to have any pre-embryos cryopreserved and consent to: 
		<dd>The disposal of any non transferred pre-embryos.  _____________________  (initials of husband and wife)  
		<dd>Donation of extra pre-embryos. (separate consent required) <p>

<li>We here indicate our decision for only ______________ (number of eggs/all) to be inseminated (mixed with sperm) _________________  (initials of husband and wife)  <p>
</ol>
	The undersigned wife and husband hereby knowingly and voluntarily release ARHC, Mark Perloe, M.D., Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, Roman Pyrzak, Ph.D. and all of their respective employees and agents, from any and all actions, claims, costs, expenses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, damages, settlements, compromises, judgments and any other losses or expenses they incur or for which they may be responsible with respect to such discarding of either fertilized or unfertilized eggs.<p>

<b>CONSENT</b><br>

	We hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless ARHC, Mark Perloe, M.D., Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank and all of their respective employees and agents, from and against any and all such actions, claims, costs, expenses and liabilities, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees, court costs, damages, settlements, compromises, judgments and any other losses or expenses they incur or for which they may be responsible with respect to any claim or legal action arising out of the egg donation.  <b></b>

	We have been informed and understand that ARHC is a tradename under which Mark Perloe, M.D. practices medicine.  We have been informed and understand that neither ARHC nor Mark Perloe, M.D. are employees or agents of Georgia Baptist Medical Center.  We understand and acknowledge that Mark Perloe, M.D. is an independent practicing physician and in our discussions with representatives of ARHC and with Dr. Perloe, and in reaching our decision evidenced herein, we have been dealing with and relying upon the ARHC and Mark Perloe, M.D. <p>
