ABSTRACT This paper presents methods and results for the prediction
of energy conservation retrofits for heating, ventilating, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) systems as part of the Great Building
Energy Predictor ShootoutII. The predictions are based on hourly
whole-building electricity, motor control center electricity;
lights and equipment electricity, cooling and heating energy use,
and the accompanying weather data. An autoassociative neural network
was used as a preprocessor to replace the missing data and a standard
feed-forward artificial neural network was utilized to predict
building energy consumption. Although the prediction results were
acceptable for the verification of the sample networks, actual
building energy prediction could have benefited by including the
holiday and weekend information during the network training as
well as information from previous time steps.

ABSTRACT This paper describes two projects that were specifically
designed to be energy efficient and environmentally responsible:
one residential and one commercial. It was expected that the projects
would achieve significant reductions relative to conventional
buildings in five areas: operating energy, embodied energy, water
use, use of ozone-depleting chemicals, and construction waste
management. Both buildings were intended to be leading edge, showing
how far buildings could reasonably go to minimize their environmental
impact. While setting percentage reduction in building operating
energy was relatively easy, setting targets in the other areas
was difficult. For the other four areas, there was little information
on conventional practice, the impact of alternative practices,
and what a reasonable environmental target would be. This paper
describes the analysis that was carried out in each of the five
areas for the two buildings.

ABSTRACT A methodology for planning and design of energy efficient
buildings is presented and analysed. The starting point is the
definition that energy efficiency is a question of minimizing
the energy end-use within realistic economic frames and fully
preserved function. The methodology is based on a systematic approach
to the issue of energy efficiency. One element in this is the
introduction of a number of energy related ratios, Energy Performance
Ratios, that characterise the influence of building parts and
the technical systems of the building on the energy end-use of
the building as an entirety. These ratios are selected and formulated
so that they facilitate a systematic strive towards high energy
efficiency when applied in planning and design of buildings. In
the present work the methodology is applied primarily on design
and rating of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems
with a focus on commercial buildings. However, the methodology
itself is not meant to be limited to these applications. The basic
idea is that it should be applied on all the parts of the building
that have an obvious influence on the energy end-use.

ABSTRACT Eight ventilation parameters (room air exchange rate,
diffuser neck diameter, diffuser type, number of returns, return
location, cage type, room size, and cage rack arrangement) for
laboratory animal facilities were studied in a full-scale room
ventilation simulator. Air exchange rates, velocities, and temperatures
within the room and the cages were studied. Room airflow pattern
and cage airflow patterns were determined using smoke tests. Cage
conditions varied widely among cages within the same room. Cage
type was the most important factor influencing cage conditions.
Room air exchange rate, air velocity approaching the cage, number
of returns, return location, and diffuser type did not significantly
influence cage conditions in the ranges studied. Room air velocities
approaching the cage were not high enough to have a major influence
on shoebox cage ventilation rate. Air diffusion performance index
(ADPI) did not show a difference between the diffuse type, the
number of returns, or return location, but ADPI did show a difference
with the room ventilation rate and diffuser neck size.

gauging the impact on heating loads in a northern climate. Three
methods of terminating combustion air ducts were evaluated: open
pipe, diffuser, and motorized damper. In addition, the effect
of installing a fresh air duct connected directly from the outdoors
to the return side of a forced-air furnace was measured. The results
are applicable to areas of Canada and the United States in which
airtight construction methods and/or local codes require the provision
for identifiable supplies of combustion and fresh air.

ABSTRACT The purpose of the study was to assess actual ventilation
and indoor air quality in the Finnish school building stock. Ventilation
and indoor air quality of elementary and secondary schools were
studied by distributing questionnaires to 1264 principals of the
schools. In addition, measurements of ventilation and indoor air
quality were made in 10 schools. The questionnaire for the principals
inquired general data about school buildings, occurrence of complaints
of poor indoor air quality, and occurrence of water damage or
mold problems. The measurements of ventilation and indoor air
quality in the classrooms included ventilation rate, CO2 and particle
concentrations, and temperature and humidity. Poor ventilation
system caused indoor air quality problems in 70% of the cases
by the opinion of the school principals. Building materials or
constructions and water damage was stated as the reason of the
problems in 40% of the cases. Too large number of pupils was mentioned
as the reason of the problems in 31% of the cases. The school
principals proposed measures for improving the indoor air quality
in almost 90% of the schools. In 73% of these proposals, improvement
of the ventilation system was suggested.

ABSTRACT A Guide for Residential Indoor Air Quality Investigations
presents a proposed series of steps that should be followed by
trained specialists for identifying and determining the urgency,
severity, cause and possible remedial actions needed when a possible
indoor air quality problem is reported. It starts with questions
that can be given over the phone to occupants and includes steps,
questions, and observations for a field visit and a written report,
if considered necessary. The Guide is a useful resource for those
considering the causes of indoor air quality problems in residences,
and can be used to improve an investigators understanding of some
of the issues and procedures.

ABSTRACT A simple and accurate technique to directly measure the
outdoor air delivery rates to building occupants is presented.
A few (two to three) measurements of tracer concentrations are
sufficient for calculation. Experimental results show that the
calculated outdoor air change rates from the tracer gas experiments
agreed well with the outdoor airflow rates measured independently
by nozzles. A relationship between the local outdoor air exchange
rate and the mean age of air was derived. The proposed technique
provides a way of simplifying the measurement of mean age of air
and correcting experimental errors. Experimental results show
that almost all the errors in the mean age of air (a maximum of
20% in our tests) caused by inaccurate timing of the start of
a tracer gas step-up process (tracer buildup) can be corrected
by the proposed method. The underestimated ages of air in the
step-down processes (tracer decay) were also successfully corrected.

ABSTRACT It is shown that comparing measured indoor and outdoor
contaminant concentrations can be misleading if the concentrations
vary with time and if the averaging periods are too short. In
this article an alternative methodology aimed at estimating the
internal source and sink effects in mechanically ventilated buildings
is described. The methodology is based on both the results from
continuous measurements, and calculations under transient conditions.
The relative importance of indoor sources and outdoor sources
is established by a comparison of the measured indoor concentration
and a calculated indoor concentration of a compound. Furthermore,
dynamic calculations are used to investigate how the indoor concentrations
of contaminants originating outdoors and contaminants emitted
from indoor sources are influenced by temporal reductions of the
airflow rate. Reducing the outdoor airflow rate during periods
with high outdoor concentrations can significantly reduce the
indoor levels of pollutants for situations in which the outdoor
sources are more important than the indoor sources.

ABSTRACT The problems associated with poor indoor air quality
may in most cases be attributed to poorly designed and poorly
performing ventilation systems. The problems in a mechanically
air-conditioned building are compounded if the building is fairly
air tight and depends on fresh air provision at the central fresh
air intake in the air handling unit (AHU). The performance of
such a ventilation system not only depends on the quantity of
fresh air provided at the fresh air intake but the manner in which
this air is distributed around the various zones in the building.
The ventilation performance, characterised by the space air distribution,
may be dictated by either the initial design and commissioning
of the different components of the air-conditioning system, such
as the AHU, ducts, diffusers, etc. or subsequent changes in the
office space layout and furnishing. This paper deals with the
determination of some key ventilation parameters such as the air
change rate, the age of air and the air exchange efficiency, all
of which lead to an insight into the performance of the ventilation
system. The approach is case-study-based and the methodology involves
tracer gas analysis employing the concentration decay method as
a means of determining the key parameters.

ABSTRACT This study examines the effectiveness of using carbon
dioxide-based, demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) to provide
adequate indoor air quality with minimum energy use. A detailed
building energy analysis program (ENERPASS) was combined with
a contaminant-level prediction program (CONTAM87) to perform the
analysis. The combined program was used to evaluate the annual
heating and cooling energy consumption and carbon dioxide and
formaldehyde concentrations. The assessment was made on a mid-size
commercial building designed to comply with ASHRAE Standard 90.1.
Three separate heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
systems were studied: single zone (ie. multiple roof top units),
multizone, and variable air volume (VAV). The simulations were
made for five ventilation control strategies: fixed ventilation;
building return air controlled to 1,000 ppm and 800 ppm; floor
return air controlled to 1,000 ppm; and each zone controlled to
1,000 ppm.

ABSTRACT This paper investigates the effect ventilation has on
the sensory evaluation of indoor air quality by occupants and
visitors, both trained in air quality evaluation and untrained,
during three separate periods in a London office building. Results
from the study suggested that trained panels used to judge the
level of indoor air quality failed to indicate the level of occupant
dissatisfaction. A naive panel also failed to show agreement with
either occupant or trained panel assessment of indoor air quality.
Occupants may perceive indoor air quality as unacceptable, but
odour is not considered the main problem. This suggests that the
assessment of odour levels gives a poor indication of indoor air
quality. The study revealed no statistically significant correlation
between perceived indoor air quality and ventilation rates.

ABSTRACT This thesis studied empirically the air handling etiology
of the non specific symptoms of the eyes, respiratory tract, skin,
and central nervous system in office workers, often termed the
sick building syndrome. The results of a four-period crossover
trial in 75 office workers suggest that 70% air recirculation
when accompanied by an adequate intake of outdoor air can be used
without causing adverse effects. A cross-sectional study of 2678
workers in 41 randomly selected office buildings from Helsinki
metropolitan area provides evidence that mechanical ventilation,
air conditioning, steam and evaporative humidification and air
recirculation are risk indicators of studied symptoms in the existing
Finnish office building stock. The results also suggest that outdoor-air
ventilation rates below the optimal increase the risk of the sick
building syndrome symptoms with such sources of pollutants as
present in mechanically ventilated office buildings. Theoretical
examination reveals that the sick building syndrome is a figurative
concept of everyday language, rather than a singular disease entity.
A theoretical model, the Office Environment Model, is presented
to explain relations between the office environment and health.

ABSTRACT Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been simultaneously
measured indoors and outdoors at 50 sparsely occupied telecommunications
(Telco) offices, 9 variably occupied data centers and 11 densely
occupied administrative (Admin) offices. Comparisons among the
three building types, as well as within each of the building types,
showed the influence of ventilation and sources. On average, the
Telco and Admin facilities were better ventilated than the Data
Centers, and the geometric mean of the 1/0`s (sum of the concentrations
of identified VOCs) at Telco (3.2) and Admin (5.3) facilities
were lower than at Data Centers (8.6) Admin Offices had more and
stronger sources than Telco Offices, when comparably ventilated
facilities were compared, many VOCs had 1/0 ratios that were significantly
larger at the Admin Offices, Furthermore, certain VOCs were detected
in Admin but not Telco Offices. The influence of human occupancy
on indoor VOCs was gauged by comparing sparsely and densely occupied
buildings. Octamethylcyclotrasiloxane (D4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane
(D5), n-dodecan (n-C12) through n-hexadecane (n-C16), limonene,
and, to a lesser extent, tetrachloroethylene were all present
in higher concentrations when there were more occupants (per unit
area). Within this set of compounds, D5 was the best marker of
occupant density.

ABSTRACT The radon exhalation rates from four concrete blocks
cast with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and four with substitution
of pulverized fuel ash (PFA) were monitored for 34 months starting
from November 1992. At the end of the 28th month, two OPC blocks
and two PFA blocks were immersed in water, one from each group
for 5 days the other one from each group for 10 days. These were
then taken out of water and the radon exhalation rates monitored
as usual. It was observed that the radon exhalation rate in general
decreased with the age of the concrete blocks and the rate increased
after the blocks were immersed in water. An explanation for the
first result is that the gradual dehydration of concrete as it
ages will reduce the water content in the pores of the concrete,
thus reducing the probability of retaining radon within the pores
and the probability of radon emanation from these pores. The second
result gives strong support to this assertion.

ABSTRACT Low-frequency noise, centered around a frequency of about
7 Hz was found to occur in several office rooms investigated.
Symptoms resulting from exposure to infrasound can include fatigue,
headache, nausea, concentration difficulties, disorientation,
seasickness, digestive disorders, cough, vision problems and dizziness,
that is symptoms typical of the sick building syndrome. Many of
the occupants exhibited such symptoms. It is shown that the low-frequency
component of ventilation noise is often being amplified in the
tightly sealed rooms. Repeated or long-term exposure to such amplified
infrasound may be triggering an allergic-type response in individuals.

ABSTRACT A methodology for a psychrometric analysis of the problem
of maintaining space temperature and humidity in non-humidity-generating
spaces is presented. Such spaces produce minimum or no latent
load. Several different humidification schemes, including isothermal
(steam generation) and adiabatic (evaporative cooling), were analyzed.
Sometimes design engineers use outside air economizers with steam
humidifiers to save energy. In some cases, the addition of a steam
humidifier to an air-handling system with an outside air economizer
cycle was seen to require more energy than running the same system
on minimal outside air with mechanical refrigeration and substantially
lower moisture load. Because individual locations have different
operational parameters, this sort of analysis is done by the design
engineer as a tool in the selection and design of an appropriate
humidification system.

ABSTRACT The adoption of an ideal mixture model greatly simplifies
the calculation of the thermodynamic properties of moist air.
The real mixture model provides more accuracy; however, it is
necessary to introduce moist air enhancement and compressibility
factors, which can both prove to be difficult to evaluate. This
paper presents a number of approximate relationships for these
parameters that are valid for an extended thermodynamic range.

ABSTRACT Case study of solutions to complaints in a library. Complaint
involved reported health symptoms and strong chemical odours in
one section of the building. The causes were discovered and remedied,
but in the process other problems were uncovered. Environmental
measurements disclosed that CO2 concentrated was above the limit
of 1,000 ppm and further ventilation tests were carried out.

ABSTRACT An environment survey has been undertaken of environmental
conditions in 23 office spaces. This paper focuses on the responses
of 228 occupants who voted on a fresh to stale seven-point scale.
The most significant factors found in this survey for judging
freshness were air temperature and fresh air supply rate. Current
standards for fresh air are questioned and there is certainly
a need for fresh air ventilation controls to be more sensitive
to changes to indoor temperature of only 1 degree C steps which
may occur throughout the day.

ABSTRACT An initial survey has been conducted to assess a self-administered
questionnaire, finger-print and liking score which are aimed at
quantifying, in a simple manner, occupants perceptions of their
interior environments, 450 questionnaires have been analysed.
The average liking scores for groups of occupants range between
- 14% and +19%. The questionnaire responses have been found to
be consistent in two test-retests and in agreement with an earlier
independent survey. The results from four groups of occupants
in four different buildings, (208 responses), naturally ventilated
and air conditioned, are discussed in detail. In general there
was agreement between the liking scores and building sickness
scores but two buildings, each with a Building Sickness Score
of 1.7, had liking scores of +19% and +1%. The questionnaire also
revealed that office temperature, occupant health, and daylight
were important factors. Although minor modifications to the questionnaire
are considered, and have been implemented in the PROBE project,
it is hoped that the questionnaire will become a useful management
and design tool.

ABSTRACT When 207 subjects wearing their own clothing were randomly
assigned to 9 conditions, consisting of 3 levels of vertical thermal
gradient (nominally 0, 2&amp; 4K/m), and 3 levels of estimated
whole-body heat loss (40, 48 &amp; 56 W/m2 as measured on a similarly-clothed
and seated thermal manikin, corresponding to warm, neutral and
cool conditions respectively, &quot;warm&quot; being 1.4K above
neutral in terms of operative temperature, and &quot;cool&quot;
being 1.4K below) and exposed for 1 hour, local thermal discomfort
was reported by 45% of the group. Local and whole body discomfort
sensations were unaffected by thermal gradient (P&gt;0.30), but
were strongly affected by operative temperature (P<0.001).  Discomfort due to dry air was  unaffected by thermal gradient (P> 
0.30) but increased significantly with operative temperature (P&gt;0.001).
Discomfort due to dry eyes increased significantly above 2 K/m
(P<0,001), but was unaffected by operative  temperature (P>  0.80).
Individual difference in thermal and air quality requirements
are shown to be sufficient to cause the thermal discomfort associated
with thermal gradients up to 4 K/m.

ABSTRACT The near-zone of an air inlet device is the most critical
part of a room as regards fulfillment of the thermal conform demands.
An acceptable solution for residential buildings can be to supply
the outdoor air through an air device place behind a radiator.
Such a device provides a mechanical exhaust system that supplies
pre-heated outdoor air. Normally radiator air devices are located
below a window and window-sill. To examine the influence of a
window-sill placed above an air device, several different positions
and breadths of sills were tested. Air velocities, and air temperatures
were measured at distances within 0.50m from the device. The measurements
show that thermal comfort is strongly dependent on the location
of the window-sill in relation to the air device. The degree of
turbulence intensity affects the percentage of dissatisfied people
due to draught. The velocity measurement system used in this study
allows variation of the time constant of the system. When different
time constants were used, the measured turbulence intensity varied
considerable. Some measurements were carried out with the radiator
switched off. In these cases different air velocities were measured,
depending on the orientation of the sensors. This seems to be
due to the temperature and velocity gradients at the measuring
points.
