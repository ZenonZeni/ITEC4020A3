THE BEST PLACE TO DO BUSINESS
</font>
</center>
<p>
Attracting quality, high-profile events to Melbourne is a major component of 
Business Victoria's industry and business events strategy, and there is no 
finer venue in the region to hold these than the new 
Melbourne Exhibition Centre.
<p>
The Melbourne Exhibition Centre is part of the Industry and the first major
project to be completed under the Victorian Government's Agenda 21 program.
<p>
It opened for business in February 1996 with Victoria on Show, a landmark 
exhibition featuring the achievements of Victoria in manufacturing, 
research and development, technology and much more.
<p>
The Melbourne Exhibition Centre is the largest and best-equipped 
exhibition venue in the Southern Hemisphere. It provides a world class 
facility for Victorian, Australian and international businesses and 
industries to showcase their strengths, and reinforces Melbourne's position 
as the trade and public exhibition capital of Australia.
<p>
The Melbourne Exhibition Centre  provides: 
<ul>
<li>30,000 square metres of clear-span exhibition space 
<li>8,000 square metres of public concourse and amenities 
<li>1,500 square metres of meeting room space 
<li>1,800 basement and ground-level car spaces on site. 
</ul>
<p>
It caters for international, national and local exhibitions, for trade or public 
audiences, or a mixture of both. Close to the heart of the city and a wide 
range of accommodation, it offers easy access by different forms of 
transport.
<p>
The exhibition industry in Australia is worth some $1.3 billion, with 
Victoria accounting for 31% of this market. Business Victoria is specifically 
targetting events which will further enhance Melbourne's position as the 
events capital of Australia and which relate to Victoria's key industry 
sectors and areas of business.
<p>
Business Victoria can help co-ordinate efforts to attract key industry and 
business events to Victoria. Assistance will be provided to eligible bodies on 
a case-by-case basis. Events  which Business Victoria has attracted to 
Melbourne include:
<ul>
<li>Pakprint, Australia's largest packaging and printing trade show;
<li>The Australian Telecommunications and Users Group Expo;
<li>Australian International Airshow and Aerospace Expo, which has 
been secured for 1997 and 1999; and
<li>The National Trade and Investment Outlook Conference for 1996 and 
1997. This is the leading annual trade and investment event and has 
a significant impact on business and tourism in Victoria.
</ul>
<p>
Victoria is the best place in the Asia-Pacific to do business. Its pro-business 
Government, highly skilled workforce, and strategic time zone make it an 
ideal business location. The latest surveys indicate that investment growth 
in Victoria will be above Australia's average in 1995-96 .
<p>
Exhibition organisers should also be aware that Victoria is...
<ul>
<li>The industrial heartland of Australia, providing 32% of Australia's 
total manufacturing output;

<li>The hub of Australia's transport system, with Australasia's largest 
general cargo port and and international airport operating 24 hours a 
a day and served by 42 airlines;

<li>The centre of  the south-east region of Australia, which includes the 
cities of Sydney, Adelaide and Hobart, where 70% of the population 
lives;

<li>The base for six of Australia's ten largest corporations, most of 
Australia's world class medical research institutes and more than 
1,000 food processing companies.
</ul>
<p>
The Victorian economy is significantly larger than the regional economies of 
Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines, and about two thirds the size of 
the Hong Kong economy.
