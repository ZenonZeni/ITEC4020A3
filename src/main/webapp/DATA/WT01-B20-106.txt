<CENTER>DRUG LEGALIZATION</CENTER>
* Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday the New York Times ran a piece noting that the lead story in the next issue of the National Review is going to call for the legalization of drugs. The rationale for this argument is that the war on drugs has failed and that the only solution is to declare defeat and turn the asylum over to the inmates.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>I am not sure just what information the folks at the National Review are using, but the facts are flawed and the argument is dumb and irresponsible.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>Mr. Buckley, the author of the piece, is safe in making such arguments because he personally does not plan to use drugs. No one of his immediate acquintance is likely to start using dangerous drugs. So the consequences of his advocacy will not be felt personally. Instead, the burden of his ideas will be borne by countless families whose kids -- the most at-risk population -- will fall victim to the consequences of drug abuse. The costs will also be borne by the public purse, as we have to treat the walking wounded.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>Although there is no public support for the idea of legalization, and none in the Congress, some of our culture elite -- left and right -- keep raising the idea as if it had some intellectual merit. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I am therefore submitting for the R<SMALL>ECORD</SMALL> a longer statement on the common mistakes made in the legalization argument that I hope will help in closing this latest chapter in foolishness.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>The statement follows:</B></FONT>

<CENTER>STATEMENT BY CHARLES E. GRASSLEY: DRUG LEGALIZATION</CENTER>
<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>I have been increasingly concerned about the tendency in some quarters to
promote the legalization of drugs in this country. If there is any idea that
is essentially without merit and without public support, it is that this
country should entertain seriously the notion that dangerous drugs should be
legalized and made widely available. Drug legalization is truly an
invitation to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unfortunately, many in the media and in our cultural elite, who have a
disproportionate access to public communication and opinion outlets, have
once again started to advocate some form of legalization. While this
advocacy is not likely to lead to a major change in public policy, it can
and does have an adverse influence on thinking about the dangers of drug. It
sends a mixed message about the dangers of use that is particularly harmful
when it touches our young people.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
As Bill Bennett and Joe Califano noted recently, drugs are illegal because
they are dangerous, they are not dangerous because they are illegal.
Legalization advocates, however, deploy a variety of arguments on behalf of
their position that ignore this essential fact. They all too often resort to
scare tactics, misrepresent reality, or skip over inconvenient facts. I
think that it is important to set the record straight.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
There are a number of misconceptions about our efforts to deal with the drug
problem. It is important to understand these and the common arguments used
to promote them in order to arrive at a reasoned and reasonable
understanding of what the drug problem is about. One of the first points to
note is that our last drug epidemic--during the 1960s, 1970s, and early
1980s--was the result of arguments made by some that drugs were really not a
problem and that everyone would feel better, live better, and prosper from
the self-administration of dangerous drugs.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The claim, made with considerable fervor, was that drugs were liberating and
that only a repressive society would prevent people from achieving their
true potential. By the late 1980s, we finally came to realize just what a
cruel hoax, a big lie, these claims were. We are still trying to cope with
an addict population from that ear, a period that has left us with a legacy
of lives blasted by drug use, a cost that is borne by families and the
public purse. We cannot afford to ignore this lesson, to repeat a disaster
based on the enthusiasms of a few.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10><I>Mistake #1: Prohibition doesn't, can't work. Efforts to keep people from using drugs, like alcohol prohibition, only encourages the idea of forbidden fruit, increases crime, and will always fail.</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The argument that prohibition doesn't work relies on a collective amnesia
about this country's experience with alcohol prohibition between 1920 and
1934. In the first place, Prohibition did not make the use of alcohol
illegal, only its manufacture and sale over a certain strength. It was, in
effect, a control regime legalizing personal use. This effort came at the
end of a very long history
in this country of trying to reduce the consumption of alcohol from
dangerous heights. The modern parallel is with the efforts to reduce tobacco
use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Second, Prohibition did not lead to a major increase in violent crime, as is
often claimed. The major increase, particularly in violent crime in this
country, came between 1900 and 1910, well before the prohibition movement.
Violent crime remained fairly stable or declined during Prohibition. While
it is true that crime rates decreased after Prohibition this was not the
result of ending Prohibition. Nor did Prohibition create organized crime.
Major organized crime groups existed well before alcohol prohibition and
they prospered after it ended.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Third, major health problems, such as cirrhosis of the liver and
alcohol-related psychoses, declined sharply during Prohibition. Alcohol
consumption, even though it was not illegal, also declined sharply. It
increased in the years following the repeal of Prohibition, as did the
associated health problems.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Fourth, it is important to remember also that alcohol, unlike dangerous
drugs, had wide social acceptance and a long history of use. Alcohol can
also be used by most people without creating impairment, either temporary or
long term. Marijuana, cocaine, and heroin have no such long history of
popular public use or acceptance, and their use is solely for the purpose of
intoxication. In fact, the public has opposed these substances once they
learned how dangerous and destructive they were. This is also true
historically in this country and internationally. No society today has a
legalization regime for dangerous drugs.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
In addition, it is clear that control efforts, when reinforced by serious
law enforcement, prevention, and education programs do deter use, especially
among young people. Our own recent experience illustrates how effective we
can be. After decades of increasing use in this country, we reversed the
trend of drug use when, beginning in the mid-1980s, we decided to just say
no and to get serious about doing something. Overall drug use, apart from
addicts, declined by more than 50 percent; cocaine use by 70 percent.
Unfortunately, more recently, as we have moved away from these serious
programs we have seen a return to use in the most at-risk
population--teenagers.<BR>
<BR><CENTER>[Page: S328]</CENTER>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #2: Legalization will mean less crime because the profit motive is removed and we will lock fewer people up when we make our drug laws more
humane</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
First, most prisoners in state and Federal prisons are not there for drug
offenses as their first or major offense. Most offenders are in jail for
violent or repeat offenses. Of these, despite the wildy exaggerated numbers
often cited, only 10 percent of Federal prisoners and 17 percent of state
inmates committed their crimes to obtain drugs. Indeed, research shows that
most career criminals came to drug use after starting their criminal
activities, not before. Legalization will not greatly reduce the crime rate,
especially for violent crimes. Indeed, in so far as the pharmacological
effects of drugs, particularly cocaine and other stimulants, exacerbate
violent tendencies, legalization will produce far greater violent crime
rates as the number of 'legal' addicts soars.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Second, the vast majority of prisoners serving time from drug offenses are
not there for use but for
trafficking--individuals whose actions destroy lives and menace
neighborhoods.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Third, legalization will not end black markets for drugs, unless we are
prepared to legalize drug use for all ages down to the age of 6 or 7. Only
the most radical legalization advocates want to see kids using drugs. But to
leave any population out of a legalization regime means leaving a black
market. Crime will not simply disappear nor will the organizations that are
currently trafficking in illegal drugs.

<SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #3: Legalization will mean a healthier climate in which controlled
drug use will provide quality control and monitored use</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
This argument misses or misrepresents the issue. The issue is not whether we
make drugs, which are inherently dangerous to use, more pure, but whether we
permit their use at all. Britain led the way in trying to treat dangerous
drug use as a therapeutic problem, regulating addicts through doctors' care.
This was not an open drug policy for anyone to use drugs but a policy just
for addicts. The result was a disaster. It did not prevent the spread of
drug abuse. It only made doctors complicit in the act of promoting an
addiction for which they had no cure. In effect, it reversed the normal
doctor-patient relationship, putting doctors in the position of making their
patients worse off. As a result, in Britain, addiction soared, addicts got
worse not better, and the black market flourished. Similar experiences have
visited similar efforts in other countries. Now, it seems that Switzerland
is experimenting with a variation of this approach. The results are likely
to be a similar disaster, making the government and the medical community
complicit in spreading addiction.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
It is also important to keep in mind, that dangerous drugs are not
synonymous with other controlled pharmaceuticals. The latter are controlled
but they also have a therapeutic purpose. Dangerous drugs have no medical
purpose. They are addictive and destructive. To argue that these drugs
should be self-administered with the only control being over their quality
is to argue for a massive increase in the addict population, adding an even
greater burden to an over-taxed health-care system. In effect, the
legalization argument requires society to endorse a self-destructive
behavior and then requires society to provide perpetual care to the victims
at public expense.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #4: Deterrence does not work</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
When you talk to former addicts or those who have given up use, one of the
most important reasons they give for their decision to quit or seek
treatment was the threat of criminal prosecution, the difficulty of
acquiring drugs, and the cost. When drugs are perceived as expensive,
dangerous and wrongful to use, difficult to get, and involve a risk of
criminal prosecution, potential users forego use, and many current users
quit. This remains true even though most enforcement efforts focus not on
users but on violent offenders and drug traffickers.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
No program to prohibit drug use can be universally effective. Although we
have long-standing laws against child abuse or murder or theft, these have
not prevented any of these acts completely. No one doubts their importance,
however, or the role they play in discouraging yet more of these actions
than if they were not prohibited.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #5: Legalizing drugs will remove the `Forbidden Fruit' appeal of
drugs, which leads most new users, especially the young, into use</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
If this is a valid argument, then anything that society prohibits for the
general good would succumb to the same argument. Forbidding child abuse
encourages child abuse. Prohibiting murder encourages it. This is the logic
of the argument. In fact, the reverse in the case. We educate people's
understanding of what is rightful or wrongful to do by the laws that we
declare and enforce. Even during Prohibition, when use was legal, the simple
message sent by society that use was bad caused significant drops in use.
Whenever we have enforced our drug laws and backed these up with education
and prevention programs endorsed by our civic and cultural leaders, we have
seen use decline and young people forego use. When we ignore this simple
reality we see kids returning to drug use.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unless one contemplates making cocaine and heroin routinely available to
12-18 year olds, something even few legalizers argue, then legalization will
not remove the so-called `Forbidden Fruit' appeal. It will only add the idea
that society condones use while continuing to prohibit access to the most
at-risk population. Just the absence of a clear message on drug use in the
last few years has seen teens returning to use in disturbing numbers. A
legalization message would have devastating results.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #6: Drug use is a purely personal choice. It is a victimless crime. The state has no right to keep people from using drugs</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
The idea that an individual who uses drugs does so in some vacuum that
affects no one else is another one of those fictions that obscures the
facts. In the first place, drug users don't stay home. They go to work and
play with the rest of us. They use the highways, they drive the school buses
and trains, they fly the planes. They also encourage others to use, thus
spreading the problem.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
People under the influence of dangerous drugs are more prone to workplace
accidents, are more likely to have highway accidents, are more prone to use
violence in public and family disputes, and are at greater risk for health
care than are non-users. Addicts are far more likely to lose control over
their own lives, and are more in need of public intervention. A considerable
percentage, perhaps as many as 60 percent, of the homeless are drug and
alcohol addicts.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Some 2 percent of live births in this country--over 100,000 babies--are born
addicted with life-long disabilities because their mothers used.
Conservative estimates of the yearly social costs of drug addiction at
current levels run around $70 billion. These costs are borne by families and
the public purse. The number of users and consequently the number of addicts
would soar under a legalization regime, compounding all the problems we
currently have. There is no such thing as a purely private use of drugs
without consequences. There is no known cure for addiction. A choice for
legalization would be a self-inflicted disaster.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
<I>Mistake #7: Since alcohol and tobacco are legal, and cause far more harm
than dangerous drugs, we should make heroin, cocaine, etc., legal to be
consistent. Doing so would not increase the number of users significantly</I>
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Here is the legalization argument at its most outrageous. What people are
asked to accept is the idea that because we have substances generally
available that already cause major harm--tobacco and alcohol--we should add
dangerous drugs to the occasions for woe for the sake of consistency. What
the argument says is that since we have one major problem we should make it
worse by adding another. Who are we kidding?
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
In order to rescue this logic from being completely ludicrous, people are
asked to believe a further assertion: that under a legal regime there won't
be an increase in users. Really? Let's look at what we are being asked to
believe. We are going to make drugs cheaper and freely available. We are
going to see them aggressively marketed by the producers. We are going to
have society condone the use of addictive substances. But, we are not going
to see a significant increase in use. Such is our understanding of human
nature?
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
We saw what happened with drug use in this country in the 1960s and 1970s
when we allowed the de facto legalization of drugs, condoning personal use
and not enforcing our laws. That partial legal environment caused a dramatic
increase in use. Can anyone doubt the effects if we condoned use outright?
We cannot afford this kind of logic.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
These are by no means the only myths. Others hold that drug laws are
racist--which is another big lie, but even if true it is hardly an argument
for making drugs legal; that the health consequences of personal use are
exaggerated; or that drug laws lead to locking up lot of innocent people. 
None of these arguments can sustain serious attention or thought. Nor is
there any major public support for drug legalization. The argument is
pressed by only a few, some liberal, some conservative. To make the argument
requires, however, suspension of judgment, a willingness to accept
assertions over facts, and a professional absence of mind that ignores
experience.
<BR><SPACER TYPE=HORIZONTAL SIZE=10>
Unfortunately, while the argument for legalization has little public
support, it is a major agenda item of many of our cultural elites. They have
a disproportionate influence on our public discourse, on our radios and
television, in the movies, in music and the arts. This means they have a
disproportionate influence on the most at-risk population for drug
users--our young people. By helping to obscure the message of the dangers of
drug use, by encouraging it as part of a `liberated' life style, they
contribute directly to use. When our political leaders remain silent they
aid and abet this. The result in the 1960s made the point. Our recent
experience confirms it: When you replace `Just Say No' with `Just Say
Nothing' or `I didn't inhale,' you are opening the door to trouble.
