Subj: Temporary Assignment
<br>
Date: 96-12-04 13:23:48 EST
<br>
From: zeldam@temptress.com (Zelda Marcos, President, Temptress, Inc.)
<br>
To: ravennaf@hyperlink.com

<P>
Dear Ms. Furlong:<BR>

<P>
I'm pleased to inform you that the Temptress agency has secured a temporary full-time position for you. The job is with Silicon Fusion, a leading high-tech firm. You are to act as administrative assistant to Hunter Highbridge, president of Silicon Fusion. He requested someone who is bright and motivated with strong interpersonal, communication and organizational skills, a solid background in word processing, and some marketing experience. But everyone wants caviar at cat food prices, don't they?<BR>

<P>
Your part-time jobs at Clothed Minds and Chai High Caf&eacute; during the 18 months since you graduated from Swale College didn't precisely qualify you, but we were able to convince Mr. Highbridge of your suitability for this position. The fact that you were editor of the <I>Swale Daily Mudraker </I>seemed to satisfy them on the communications skills front. I was able to make your senior project (<I>Breaking the Frame: Images of Ritual Abuse and Patriarchal Domination in the Paintings of Norman Rockwell)</I> sound like a level-headed exploration of American art history. I managed to gloss over your arrest outside the embassy of that former Soviet republic last spring. (Which one was it? Kohlrabistan? Rutabagastan?) <BR>

<P>
Mr. Highbridge has indicated that there is no dress code at Silicon Fusion, but I would suggest that you not change your hair color too often early on. <BR>

<P>
You are to start on Monday. Please call me to confirm your acceptance of the offer. <BR>

<P>
