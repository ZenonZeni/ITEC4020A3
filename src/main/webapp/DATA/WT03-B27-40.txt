During the numerous mining booms that hit Eastern Oregon, thousands of Chinese laborers were employed. John Day, the first community we travel through on this day, is the site of the Kam Wah Museum which celebrates the herbal medicine practices of these mine workers.
<P>
After John Day, we head for the community of Fox, a small farming hamlet where lunch will be served by the spirited folks from Long Creek, the next community on the route. Unfortunately, the mileage was too long for us to actually serve lunch in Long Creek. But that didn't stop them, for they came to us.
<P>
While you're eating, be sure to look at the drawings on display produced by the elementary school children in the area. You'll have a chance to vote for your favorite few and watch awards being presented. Down the road, when passing through Long Creek, take note of their 1991 centennial sign on display. Long Creek has the dubious distinction of having experienced the worse tornado ever to hit Oregon. On June 3, 1891, 200 mph winds blasted the community, destroying most of the original homesteads. Let's just hope if we experience similar winds they'll be blowing at our backs!
<P>
Monument, our overnight host community, is an agricultural town bustling with activity in September. Hay, mint, apples and pears all come to harvest. As bountiful as the crops are, they're no match for the generous welcome planned for our arrival. Whether you partake of the street dance or indulge in some of the homemade treats (and crafts) on hand, you're sure to end the day with a smile.
