It's been a little over a year since Wesley Barnes began managing the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Project. In that year much has happened   significant budget cuts, personnel
reductions, revised program direction, and relocation of the Project Office at the base of the La
Madre Mountains in northwestern Las Vegas. What follows are his words and thoughts as he
began his second year.<P>
<P>
<B>Q.   Mr. Barnes, what do you most want readers to understand about the Yucca Mountain
Project?</B><P>
<P>
<B>A. </B>  I want them to understand that this is a world-class project and that this is a job worth doing.
That is why people stay when there is so much daily adversity. When I first came here and
experienced the adversity   the negative accounts in the media, the people who persist in painting
portraits that have nothing to do with the facts, I wondered why the talented professionals,
world-class professionals that we have, stay here? Why would they want to take this abuse, deal
with the complicated bureaucracy, the politics that impact us? I believe they stay because they
have found this is a job worth doing   in spite of the adversity.<P>

<B>Q.  Are there any other repositories in the world? How does our progress in establishing a
repository compare with other nations with similar goals?<P></B> 
<P>
<B>A.  </B> I was recently briefed on the world situation, with regard to nations that have repository
programs. Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom have active repository or underground research laboratory programs that are
making progress. If we stay on our current path, we will be ahead of those programs when we
reach the license application stage.<P>
     We have made a great deal of progress in our investigation of Yucca Mountain. When I first
came here a year ago, there was so much more uncertainty. This was a research project that had
not gotten to the analysis stage in very many areas. Much of that has now changed. Our scientists
have studied the data from extensive scientific and analytical work performed since site
characterization began, and have confirmed various early hypotheses about the mountain. In the
process, they also have reduced some scientific and technical uncertainties about its potential
performance as a repository.<P>
<P>
<B>Q.   What are the chief hurdles the Project faces right now?</B><P>
<P>
<B>A.   </B>Human limitations, preconceptions, and biases. But I see some of that changing, and believe
that enough is changing to allow us to accomplish our mission of site characterization,
preparation of the Yucca Mountain Viability Assessment, evaluation of site suitability,
development of an environmental impact statement, a Secretarial site recommendation to the
President, and a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.<P>
<P>
<B>Q.   How was it to go back into the public sector after the time you've spent in the private sector?</B>
<P>
<P>
<B>A. </B>  It's been tough.  When I first took the job, I was blinded by the happiness I felt at being back
with people I highly respect, working for Dr. Dreyfus and on an important project. Then I began
feeling the effects of the bureaucracy and the adversity; it was tough. But now that feeling has
passed. It's getting easier for me because it is easier for me to control myself. <P>
<P>
     However, one of the things I wouldn't change, you know how journalists sometimes ask you,
"If you were God for a day, what would you change?..." One of the things I wouldn't change is
the news media. I believe they fill a valuable role. I do worry, however, about the long-term
effects of such negative coverage. If professionals feel continually unfairly maligned and
misrepresented, the dynamic will be that those who are talented leave the Project and go work
somewhere that's not so adversarial. It could be that over time, the news media may actually
contribute to a sort of selective process that selects for people who aren't really talented, who
don't have so many options, who can't choose to go elsewhere.... Thank goodness that has not
happened. As I said earlier, I'm deeply impressed that we have the talented people we do and that
so many have stayed for years.<P>
<P>
     And, in the larger view, my life has come full circle. I'm now working in the Federal
department I helped create. It's not at all now what we envisioned then, because we were focused
on solving an energy crisis when we helped write legislation to create the Department of Energy.
<P>
<P>
     Those days when we were working on the creation of the Department were great. As I look at
the Department of Energy today, I realize that I am part of making this history.<P>
