<P>
The CRC for Cardiac Technology was established in 1992 to create a world-class, interdisciplinary research environment for the study of coronary heart disease, the major killer of Australians. It aims to commercialise the therapeutic methods, whether pharmaceutical or mechanical, resulting from that research.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
Twenty-two of its 25 full-time staff are involved in strong research teams working in four core research programs: vascular hyperplasia, cardiac mechanics and muscle assist, electrophysiology, biomaterials and electrodes. These draw heavily on the expertise of the participating institutions and the growing international network established in the US, Europe and Asia.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Ten CRC research results have been published in refereed journals, three patents have been lodged and one licensing agreement is ready to sign. The CRC has introduced an intellectual property disclosure process and formed Cardiac CRC Nominees Pty Ltd to hold its intellectual property.
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The research projects are targeted at commercial outcomes with the industrial participants fully participating in the planning and management of research and education programs.
To date, the expertise developed in the fields of materials testing and animal models have already attracted overseas interest and contracting arrangements are being negotiated. Three provisional patents have been filed for anti-restenosis agents and a polyurethane is ready for patent application.
Several technologies can have applications outside the cardiac field. For example, the 128-channel amplifier array may have industrial applications and the non-invasive tissue monitoring system could be applied to the study of muscle energetics in non-cardiac fields. Discussions are under way for commercialising these technologies. It is expected that the number of similar, commercially significant outcomes will increase in the future.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Although the CRC has its head office at the Royal North Shore Hospital in St Leonards, NSW, it has a significant partner in Victoria in the CSIRO's Division of Chemicals and Polymers, located in Clayton.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
In 1993-94 the CRC oversaw the work of 15 postgraduate students and hosted about a dozen seminars by overseas, local and internal scientists. CRC scientists are encouraged to attend and participate in local and international conferences. The CRC provides undergraduate and graduate programs, and educational activities for members of the public.
<P>
<H3>Participants</H3>
 AMRAD Corporation Limited; Associative Measurement Pty Limited; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation; Telectronics Pty Limited; Royal North Shore Hospital; St Vincent's Hospital Limited, Sydney; University of New South Wales; University of Queensland; University of Sydney; University of Technology, Sydney; and Westmead Hospital.
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The goal of the CRC is to commercialise the outcome of its research as soon as possible. Development work will initially be done by Telectronics Pacing Systems, AMRAD and Associative Measurement. However, plans are being drawn up for future involvement by small and medium-sized business enterprises as needed.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
For 1995-96, Australian Government funding was $2.13 million supplemented by funding of $300,000 by industry participants.
