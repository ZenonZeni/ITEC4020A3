<b>General Comments</b>
<P>
<I>"The (emerging era) brings with it a genuinely new way of life based on 
diversified, renewable energy sources...sensible technologies matched to the 
new, sustainable energy system toward which we are beginning to reach.</I>" 
<P>
Author and Futurist Alvin Toffler
<P>
<I>"Energy is one of the critical ingredients of our Nation's economic security.  
The Department of Energy is the vital nexus between energy security and 
national security and should not be abolished.  To dismantle the focal point of 
U.S. energy policy in order to realize only a small budgetary savings would send 
a strong message that the United States no longer recognizes the importance of 
energy security to our Nation's economic future.</I>"</blockquote>
<P>
Joint letter from Thomas Kuhn, Edison Electric Institute; Richard Lawson, 
National Coal Association; Randall Swisher, American Wind Energy Association; 
Gary Elliott, National BioEnergy Industries Association; Scott Sklar, Solar 
Energy Industries Association; and Linda Church Ciocci, National Hydropower 
Association<P>
<P>
<B>Renewable Energy</B>
<P>
<I>"The Photovoltaic Manufacturing Technology Program is making a 
positive contribution to the U.S. PV industry.  The PVMaT program helps U.S. 
photovoltaic companies compete with foreign competitors  (many of whom  are 
receiving support from their governments) and  helps develop photovoltaics as 
an alternative energy source.</I>"
<P>
Harvey Forest, President, Solarex Corporation
<P>
<I>"PVMaT has  enabled AstroPower to bring an exciting new product to the 
marketplace.  This is the first new solar cell technology to come to the market in 
the last 15 years.  It likely would not have happened with continuing U.S. 
ownership without PVMaT.</I>"
<P>
Allen M. Barnett, President, AstroPower, Inc.
<P>
<B>Energy Efficient Buildings</B>
<P>
<I>"Continued support and assistance from the Department of Energy is 
vital.  The industry is at a critical juncture ready to assimilate new approaches 
into the residential building process....This is truly a public and private 
partnership where combined research, know how and funding is aligned in a 
positive way, and not in a regulatory way, to help the homebuilding industry."  
</I>
<P>
Michael Dickens, President of IBACOS, on Building America Program
<P>
<I>"Kansas City is particularly pleased to be a partner in DOE's Rebuild 
America program.  Our program, the Kansas City Energy Efficiency Partnership, 
is an exciting new way of doing business for DOE; it provides local communities 
the flexibility to design and tailor a program to their own needs.  We are 
encouraged by the potential of programs like Rebuild America and urge 
Congress to continue to fund these partnership programs, particularly those that 
are helping our nation's cities to help themselves.</I>"
<P>
Mayor Emanuel Cleaver II, Kansas City, Missouri  
<P>
<B>Industrial Energy Programs</B>
<P>
<I>"The Motor Challenge serves as a model for public and private teamwork 
to accomplish shared goals in the energy and environmental arenas."</I>
<P>
David Buzzelli, V.P. and Corporate Director, Environmental, Health and Safety 
and Public Affairs, The Dow Chemical Company
<P>
<I>"The NICE<sup>3</sup> Program provided the last one hundred yards of the product 
development marathon to my company.  It does exactly what it is designed to do 
and gives small companies a chance to be competitive.  My company would not 
be in business today if it weren't for the NICE<sup>3</sup> Program.</I>" 
<P>
John Gaughan, President, Catalyst and Chemical Services, Inc.
<P>
<I>"I am not a big fan of government.  Over the years I've been  critical of 
many regulatory,  legislative and judicial actions, particularly as they affect the 
pulp and paper industry.  That's  why the next statement may be a bit strange.  
There is a very positive governmental program that directly affects the pulp and 
paper industry.  Specifically, it's the Department of Energy's Industries of the 
Future Program.</I>"
<P>
Alan Rooks, Editor-in-Chief, <I> Paper Industry Management Association 
Magazine</I>
<P>
<B>Alternative Fuel and Turbine Engine Programs</B>
<P>
<I>"What is really nice about getting involved in alternative fuels and  the 
Clean Cities Program is we get a lot of private companies to buy into the 
program.  We're looking at a lot of different ways to improve the environment but 
at the same time new products, which of course create new jobs .  That is what I 
think most Governors and elected officials have got to look to.  How do we 
improve the quality of life so...(it will be) better to live in that community and that 
state (tomorrow) than it is today and-- Clean Cities gives us that 
opportunity."</I>
<P>
Governor Tommy Thompson, Wisconsin
<P>
<I>"The DOE ceramic gas turbine programs have enabled U.S. ceramic and  
gas turbine manufacturers to introduce structural ceramics into commercial use, 
such as the auxiliary power oil pump parts for the new Boeing 777 and Airbus 
A330/340.  The continuing partnership between DOE and Allied Signal in the 
transportation and industrial ceramic programs ensures that there will be a 
competitive manufacturer and leading edge turbine engine technology in the 
U.S., which will provide more energy efficiency power sources, both in the U.S. 
and abroad.</I>"
<P>
Dr. Maxine Savitz, General Manager, Allied Signal 
<P>
<I>"With the Clean Cities network, we don't have to sell the concept of 
alternative fuels, we only have to sell the vehicles, which is what we do 
best.</I>"
<P>
Tom Artushin, Ford Motor Company
<P>
<B>Federal Energy Management Program</B>
<P>
<I>"The  New Mexico Initiative is a great  example of how the  public and 
private sectors  can work together to save our important energy and water 
resources.  We need these types  of water and energy resource champions for 
our future</I>."
<P>
Senator Pete Domenici,  New  Mexico
<P>
<I>"FEMP has been and continues to be the honest broker  helping agencies 
reduce  their energy costs by bringing together  utilities like  ConEd with our  
Federal partners.  ConEd's commitment  to the  environment  has been greatly  
aided  by FEMP's  efforts.   FEMP should be applauded for their continuing  
outstanding work for  citizens of this country.</I>"
