<P>
Although stocks have historically outperformed
other financial assets, they are also the most volatile. As shown
in the following chart of the S&amp;P 500 index between 1950-1995,
stocks provided a positive total return in 34 of the years, but
also had a negative return in 12 of them. The &quot;fear of losing&quot;
part of their investment during the down years is what prevents
many investors from investing in stocks.

<P>
But looking at the annual returns of stocks can give you a distorted picture. 
Although past performance is not
a guarantee of future results, history will show you that time
is on your side when you invest in stocks. 

<P>
As the following chart shows, the longer
you hold stocks, the number of down periods diminish. Using a
five-year holding period from 1950-1995, the number of down
periods drops from 12 to three, but holding stocks for a 15-year
period provided a positive return 100% of the time. In fact it's
true for any consecutive 15-year period since 1926. As the
chart illustrates, a long holding period is required for successfully
investing in stocks.
