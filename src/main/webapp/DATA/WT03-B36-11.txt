CONSEQUENCES OF FEDERAL UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) LEGISLATION TO UTILITIES

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) paper
reviews some of the potential consequences of recent
federal legislation on Demand-Side Management (DSM) to
utilities.  It covers the 1992 Energy Policy Act
(EPAct), the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act, and
FERC Order No. 636.  The paper: outlines the contents
of the federal legislation regarding utility DSM
programs; explains some of the impacts of these laws
and regulations on utility programs, particularly the
likely effects with respect to the emerging competitive
utility market; and seeks to understand where and how
action will be needed to carry out many of the
provisions of these laws in the most cost-effective
manner.

Examples of specific activities regarding DSM in
Pennsylvania are included for illustration.  Each of
the federal laws under discussion is unique in terms of
origin, goals, and focus; nevertheless they all focus
on the regulated energy industries in such a way that
their effects tend to combine to force massive changes.
In the regulated electric and natural gas industries,
this synergy is compounding the complexity of
management and, at least in the short term,
contributing to increases in the cost of doing
business.  In the long term, these federal initiatives
are likely to lead to a massive reassessment of
state-regulated energy sources in production and end
use, and their environmental consequences.  The overall
effect of all three pieces of legislation is to
increase competition among the state-regulated
utilities.  The differences between competitive and
regulated industries are also noted in an effort to
explain the effect of inducing competition among energy
utilities.  This has particular relevance to
utility-sponsored energy-efficiency programs such as
DSM, and other customer-assistance activities.

UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS: 1989 THROUGH
1998

Over the pest five years, the Energy Information
Administration (EIA) has been collecting data annually
from U.S. electric utilities on their Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs, both current and projected.
The latest data, presented in this (Oak Ridge National
Laboratory) report, cover activities for 1993 and
projections for 1994 and 1998.

In 1993, 991 utilities operated DSM programs and spent
$2.8 billion, a 13% increase over 1992 expenditures.
These and earlier DSM programs saved 44,000 GWh of
energy and reduced potential peak demand by 40,000 MW,
30% and 22% increases over the 1992 values,
respectively.  While some people predict the demise of
electric-utility DSM programs, the data do not paint as
bleak a picture.  In most parts of the country, DSM
programs grew in 1993, and utilities (as of Spring
1994) projected continued growth through 1998.
Expenditures grew from 1.3% of revenues in 1992 to 1.5%
in 1993, and are expected to grow 2.5% per year faster
than inflation.  Thus, DSM spending is expected to stay
constant at 1.5% of revenues through 1998.

Because of the cumulative effect of DSM programs,
energy savings are expected to grow from 1.2% of sales
in 1992 to 1.6% in 1993 and 3.0% in 1998.  Potential
peak reductions are expected to increase from 5 9% of
peak demand in 1992 to 6.8% in 1993 and 8.9% in 1998;
however this growth in spending is not as rapid as the
8% annual real growth projected a year earlier. Actual
expenditures in 1993 were 6.5% lower than projected
early that year; while energy savings were the same as
projected earlier.  Potential peak reductions were
actually 9% higher than previously projected.

IMPACT EVALUATION OF UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) PROGRAMS

Over the past several years, four of the largest
investor-owned California utilities have completed more
than 50 evaluation studies designed to measure the
energy and demand impacts of their Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs.  The four utilities are:
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California
Edison (SCE), Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), and
San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E).  These studies
cover residential, commercial, industrial, and
agricultural DSM programs and provide a wealth of
information on program impacts.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report summarizes
the results of these DSM evaluation studies in order to
describe what DSM has achieved in California.  It
assesses how well these achievements were forecast and
compares the effectiveness of the different types of
DSM programs.  It also documents the sizable
investments made by the California utilities in their
1990-1992 DSM programs.  Between 1990 and 1992, the
four utilities spent $772 million on energy-efficiency
and energy-conservation programs.  The report
summarizes the realization rates estimated by the
50+ evaluation studies.  Realization rates -- defined
as ex-post net savings estimates divided by ex-ante net
savings estimates -- are summarized for 158 programs
and program segments.

IMPACTS OF ELECTRIC UTILITY DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT
(DSM) PROGRAMS ON ELECTRICITY PRICE

As competition in the electricity industry increases,
utilities (and others) worry more about the upward
pressure on electricity prices that Demand-Side
Management (DSM) programs often impose.  Because of
these concerns, several utilities have recently reduced
the scope of their DSM programs, or have focused them
more on customer service and peak-demand reductions and
less on improving energy efficiency.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) study uses ORFIN
(the Oak Ridge Financial Model) to calculate the rate
impacts of DSM.  ORFIN is used to examine the two
factors that contribute to DSM's upward pressure on
prices: (1) the cost of the programs themselves; and
(2) the loss of revenue associated with fixed-cost
recovery.  The second factor reflects the reduction in
revenues caused by the DSM-induced energy and demand
savings that exceed the reduction in utility costs.

The analysis examines DSM price impacts as functions of
the following factors: (1) the DSM program itself,
including: cost; conservation load factor; geographic
focus on deferral of transmission and distribution
investments; and mix across customer classes; (2) the
utility's cost and pricing structures, which include
factors at least partly under the utility's control,
such as: retail tariffs; fixed vs. variable operating
costs; and capital costs not related to kW or kWh
growth; and (3) external economic and regulatory
factors, including: the level and temporal pattern of
avoided energy and capacity costs; rate-basing vs.
expensing of DSM-program costs; shareholder incentives
for DSM programs; load growth; and the rates for
income, property, and revenue taxes.

STUDY OF NET LOSS REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS FOR UTILITY
DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT (DSM) PROGRAMS

Utility shareholders can lose money on Demand-Side
Management (DSM) investments between rate cases.
Several industry analysts argue that the revenues lost
from utility DSM programs are an important financial
disincentive to utility DSM investment.  A key utility
regulatory reform undertaken since 1989 allows
utilities to recover the lost revenues incurred through
successful operation of DSM programs.  Explicitly
defined net lost revenue adjustment (NLRA) mechanisms
are the states' preferred approach to lost-revenue
recovery from DSM programs.

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) report examines
the experiences that states and utilities are having
with the NLRA approach.  The report: determines whether
NLRA is a feasible and successful approach to removing
the cost-revenue disincentive to utility operation of
DSM programs; identifies the conditions linked to
successful implementation of NLRA mechanisms in
different states; assesses whether NLRA has changed
utility investment behavior; suggests improvements to
NLRA mechanisms; identifies states having NLRA
mechanisms where utilities are recovering cost revenues
from DSM programs, through interviews of regulatory
agency staffs in these states and utility staffs in
four states; analyzes regulatory agency orders
involving NLRA, as well as associated testimony,
reports, and utility lost revenue recovery filings; and
uses qualitative and quantitative indicators to assess
NLRA's effectiveness. Contrary to the concerns raised
by some industry analysts, the results indicate that
NLRA is a feasible approach to the lost-revenue
disincentive.

A SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT MODEL FOR STUDYING THE
DEMOGRAPHIC IMPACTS OF ALTERNATIVE UTILITY RATE DESIGNS

Historically, utility customers have been
differentiated into various customer classes based on
their utility service demand characteristics.  This
(Argonne National Laboratory) paper argues that greater
differentiation based on value and cost of service can
be justified on grounds of economic efficiency, and if
done properly, can also promote economic equity.  Doing
this would require a break with traditional customer
classifications.  With this break, more detailed
information on how and why certain utility services are
consumed would be required.

In line with the issue of heterogeneity within the
residential customer class, is the differential impact
that different utility rates might have on different
population groups.  The paper shows how differences in
the pattern of energy use may give rise to disparate
economic impacts, depending on the rate structure, and
how more equitable and efficient outcomes might be
achieved if these differences are taken into account.
For this purpose, an analytical model has been
developed.  The Energy Policy Socioeconomic Impact
Model (EPSIM) is an econometric simulation model to
assess the economic impact of utility rate designs and
Demand-Side Management programs on various population
groups.  The paper provides a conceptual description of
the theoretical underpinnings associated with the
EPSIM.

ELECTRIC AND GAS RATES FOR RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND
INDUSTRIAL SECTORS IN 1994 FOR 45 U.S. CITIES

This 2-volume report (by Casazza, Schultz and
Associates) contains electric and gas rates for the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors in
45 U.S. cities during 1994.  The rates were collected
from the utilities that serve the 45 cities involved in
the study.  These rates apply to the residential,
commercial, and industrial sectors of service and
include both general service and various innovative
rate structures.  The information compiled from the
utilities is compared to data from other sources to
ensure consistency.  Additional contacts were made with
specific utilities to resolve observed conflicts of
information.  The information is organized in several
lengthy appendixes (A, B, and C in Volume 1, and D, E,
F, and G in Volume 2) with introductory explanatory
chapters in Volume 1.  Appendixes D and E provide rate
abstracts for the South and West regions; Appendix F
provides a list of known utility rate revisions; and
Appendix G provides 1994 utility sales data.

STUDY OF THE EXTENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE
PRODUCTION OF ELECTRICITY

This (Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) study
focuses on technological change in electricity
production.  The study is based on empirical economic
research on production functions in the electric
utility industry.  It advances a seldom used approach,
called the engineering-production function, instead of
the more common neoclassical approach used by
economists.  Combined with this approach is a major
departure from the type of data used to conduct
econometric estimations of production parameters.  The
research draws upon a consistent set of ex-ante or
blueprint data that better reflects planned technical
performance and cost data elements, in contrast to the
more customary expect-type of data from actual firm
and/or plant operations.  The results from the
examination of coal-fired technologies indicate the
presence of technical change.  Using data for the
period 1979 to 1989, it finds technical change to be
capital-augmenting at the rate of 1.8% per year.

ELECTRIC UTILITIES' ROLE IN BUILDING THE NATIONAL
INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE (NII)

In two particular aspects, from a lawyer's perspective,
that are briefly investigated in this (DOE) study ,
electric utilities appear uniquely well-positioned to
contribute to the National Information Infrastructure
(NII).

One aspect concerns the legal powers that utilities
have derived from their charters and operating
authorities and confirmed in their rights-of-way, to
carry out activities and functions necessary for
delivering electric service.  These activities and
functions include building telecommunications
facilities and undertaking information services that
are essential to manage electricity demand and supply.
The economic value, to utilities and society, from the
efficiencies made possible by telecommunications and
information could be substantial.  How great remains to
be established, but by many estimates, electric utility
applications could fund a significant share of the
capital costs of building the NII.  Although utilities'
legal powers to pursue such efficiencies through
telecommunications and information appear beyond
dispute, it is likely that effort to do so will produce
substantial excess capacity.  Who will benefit from
this excess capacity is a potentially contentious
political question that demands early resolution.  Will
this windfall go to the utility, the customer, or no
one because of political paralysis, or will there be
some equitable and practical split.

A second aspect, one of inquiry, points to another
contemporary issue of very great societal importance
that could very well become the platform on which the
first question can be resolved fortuitously: how to
achieve universal telecommunications service.  In the
effort to fashion the NII that will now continue, ways
and means to maximize the unique potential contribution
of electric utilities to meet important social and
economic needs -- in particular, universal service --
merit priority attention.

THE WHEELING OF COGENERATED POWER

This (Engineering Research and Consulting Inc.) report
concerns project considerations and design systems for
the wheeling of cogenerated power.  The term "wheeling
electric power" refers to utility transmission of power
that it doesn't own.  The term "cogeneration" refers to
simultaneous production of electric and thermal power

ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELD LEVELS FROM HIGH-VOLTAGE
TRANSMISSION LINES VERSUS THEIR DESIGN OPTIONS AND COST

This (Argonne National Laboratory) report provides
background information regarding electric and magnetic
fields (EMFs) of high-voltage transmission lines at
typical voltages and line configurations and typical
transmission line design-option costs, to assist with
alternatives for environmental control of field
strengths.  EMF strengths up to 200 ft from a
transmission-conductor centerline are calculated for:
an ac overhead line; a 345-kV and a 230-kV ac
underground line; and a (+ or -)450-kV dc overhead
line.  Compacting and height sensitivity factors are
computed for variation in EMFs when the line conductors
are moved closer or raised.  Estimated costs for the
lines are presented and discussed, so that the impact
of using alternative strategies for reducing EMF
strengths, and the implications of implementing the
strategies, can be better appreciated.

SUPERCONDUCTIVITY FOR ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS

This (NREL) report presents a program overview of
superconductivity for use in electric power systems.
Largely due to government and private industry
partnerships, electric power applications based upon
high-temperature superconductivity are now being
designed and tested, only 7 years after the discovery
of high-temperature superconductors.  These
applications offer many benefits to the national
electric system, including: increased energy
efficiency; reduced equipment size; reduced emissions;
increased stability/reliability; deferred expansion;
and flexible electricity dispatch/load management.  All
of these benefits have a common outcome: lower
electricity costs and improved environmental quality.
The DOE sponsors research and development through its
Superconductivity Program for Electric Power Systems,
which will help develop the technology needed for U.S.
industries to commercialize high-temperature
superconductive electric power applications.  The DOE
envisions that by the year 2010, the U.S. electric
power systems equipment industry will regain a major
share of the global market by offering superconducting
products that outperform the competition.

CONCERNS REGARDING ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFICIENCY
IN COMPETITIVE POWER MARKETS

For years the electric utility industry operated as a
regulated monopoly, largely immune to market forces
except those of competing fuels.  That era came to an
end with the Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act
(PURPA) of 1974, which created a market for non-utility
generated power. Within 20 years, non-regulated
non-utility generators have become the primary supplier
of new energy resources.  Their market power is matched
by their political power, as evidenced in the Energy
Policy Act of 1994 (EPAct) that requires open access to
utility transmission lines to facilitate inter-utility
bulk power sales.

Conventional wisdom regarding this issue believes that
active wholesale power markets with competition among
alternative generators will lead to lower
power-development costs and cheaper retail power
prices.  However, the trend towards alternative bulk
power sources at low prices intersects with large
retail power customers' interests in accessing
alternative power supplies.  In many instances, these
alternatives to local utilities are at a lower cost
than retail rates.

For the most part, proponents of generation competition
have remained silent about potential environmental
consequences.  However, skeptics of increased
competition, including some major environmental groups,
cite environmental impacts among their concerns.  This
(Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories) paper deals
with energy and environmental efficiency in competitive
power markets, and examines these concerns.

ELECTRICITY REGULATION IN GERMANY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
EUROPEAN MARKET

This translation from Germany (Oldenburg University)
concerns electricity regulation in Germany in the
context of the European Market.  It presents a survey
of the electric power regulatory thinking and situation
in Germany with respect to ongoing European Market
reform.  Electric utilities in Germany are semi-public
or private enterprises having a wide variety of size.
The large producer-utilities operate the high voltage
grid on the basis of private contracts.  Regional
distribution companies, mostly without a considerable
share in production and often in cooperation with local
distributors, deliver electricity in the non-urban
areas; whereas mostly city-owned electric utilities
supply the large cities, often with a considerable
share of electricity produced in cogeneration plants.
In the past, the equilibrium between the parts of this
system was ensured by a legal framework that protected
local monopolies, as well as by long-term contracts
between producers and distributors.  This equilibrium
derived its stability from political, more then
economic, factors.

Now, deregulation trends inherent in European Market
legislation on competition threaten this stability.  In
the first phase of this legislation, resistance against
a more competitive order seemed unanimous.  Since that
time, however, the different players have had time to
rethink their positionS.  The European Council has now
proposed a more moderate regulation, taking into
account the large differences among the different
member countries.  The German Government has made a
proposal for some important changes in the European
Market Energy Law and connected passages in the
Competition Law, which would introduce some
more-competitive elements into the system.  Wholesale
producers and regional distributors, as well as
customer groups, are in favor of this reform, whereas
the local distributors fear they will become the losers
in the ongoing reform process.  Environmentalists
express concern that a more competitive order could
lead to a lowering of environmental standards.

HOW A SMALL ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP HELPED REFORM ELECTRIC
UTILITY REGULATION

This (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) paper tells a
story about David and Goliaths; how a small
environmental group helped reform electric utility
regulation.  In 1991, the Land and Water Fund of the
Rockies (LAW Fund) -- a regional environmental
organization -- started an energy project with two
lawyers and a scientist to challenge the
energy-efficiency, renewable-resource, and
environmental-protection practices of utilities in the
vast six-state Rocky Mountain region.  Within three
years, Colorado and Utah had adopted comprehensive
Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) rules, and several
utilities had developed plans to expand their
Demand-Side Management (DSM) activities.  The paper
discusses the role that this small band of lawyers and
policy analysts played in stimulating these changes.
It also comments on the substantial influence and
valuable services that such a small group can provide.

to demonstrate the effectiveness of a catalytic
membrane reactor (a ceramic membrane combined with a
catalyst) to solely produce methanol by partial
oxidation of methane.  Methanol synthesis and
separation in one step would make methane more valuable
for producing chemicals and fuels.  Both ceramic and
metal membranes are tested, and similar results are
obtained.  A cooling tube is inserted inside the
membrane reactor to create a low-temperature zone that
rapidly quenches the product stream.  This
non-isothermal non-permselective membrane reactor has
proved effective for increasing methanol selectivity
during CH4 oxidation.

THE NET ENERGY BALANCE OF CORN ETHANOL

Studies conducted since the late 1970s have estimated
the net energy value of corn ethanol; however,
variations in the data and assumptions used among the
studies have resulted in a wide range of estimates.
This (Economic Research Service) study identifies the
factors causing this wide variation and develops a more
consistent estimate.  It concludes that the net energy
value of corn ethanol has become positive in recent
years due to technological advances in ethanol
conversion and increased efficiency in farm production.
It shows that corn ethanol is energy efficient, as
indicated by an energy ration of 1.24.
