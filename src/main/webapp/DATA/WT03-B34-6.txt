COAL PRIVATISATION ONE YEAR ON

The privatised coal industry was a year old on January 1. Government
has been quick to claim plaudits for the completion of another
successful privatisation and not just because of the huge amount (#950m
for the mining assets alone) of cash that it generated. However, much
of what has happened in 1995 that has been positive has been by
accident (demand recovery for example) whilst there are policy
leftovers (on opencast) which are still hurting coal.

Coal minister Richard Page, speaking to the Coal Industry Society at
the beginning of January, said of the industry that "it is a good deal
bigger than many people forecast ... one year on, there are 29 former-
BC pits in operation (30 if you count Cwmgwili) in the private sector."

Paradoxically competition, which was supposedly at the heart of the
government's privatisation policy, has had a bad year with the
dominance of one company each in England, Scotland and Wales clearly
outweighing the influence of the small to medium-sized independent
mining companies. Perhaps the biggest source of grievance in the
industry at the privatisation is that only two companies in the UK were
able to benefit significantly from higher demand in 1995, each a
successor to BC. The others simply didn't have the resources to make
more than a token effort towards meeting the generators' needs.

At a January-November figure of 31.2mt deep mined output looked set to
be 10-12% ahead of year ago levels, suggesting a full year tally of 34-
35mt. Coal consumption for power generation in January-November was
53.3mt, 4.4% below year-ago levels but still way ahead of expectations.
This implies a full year burn of 58-59mt, split between Northern
Ireland, 1-1.5mt; Scotland, 4.5mt; and England/Wales, 52-53.5mt. In
1994 RJB Mining predicted 1995/96 coal-burn by the electricity supply
industry at 36-42mt, whilst Coal UK predicted 38mt.

In a declining trend the fiscal year figures ought to be lower than the
calendar year numbers, but even so the fiscal year predictions clearly
understated 1995's potential burn. Coal benefitted from nuclear
failures, from a better-than-expected electricity demand and from
failures at new gas-fired plant. Although nuclear generation recovered
later in the year and is now ahead of year-ago levels, these factors
combined to give extra coal demand of 4-6mt over the year.

The opencast sector had its worst year since 1987, in terms of
production, and since who knows when in terms of planning permissions.
Planners point out that 30% of planning appeals are still being won,
but so far the victor has always been the same company, RJB Mining. RJB
has also done well at securing planning permissions from local
authorities, an area where the rest of the industry has experienced
problems. Opencast output at 14.9mt in January-November was marginally
below year-ago levels despite reports from the opencasters that all
sites are working flat out at the moment.

For the housecoal trade, last year's mild winter, followed by a very
warm summer when stocks were high, came close to wrecking many
businesses. For importers, the stakes were pushed too high for most
when UK producers concentrated sales efforts on the markets that they
had won from BC and sized coal imports are lower than for many years.

RJB beats all expectations

Without a doubt the star of 1995 was a rampant RJB Mining. It started
the year having just taken over the mining assets of BC's English
divisions, complete with contracts to supply National Power and
PowerGen with 28-29mt/yr to March 31 1998. Although it lost industrial
sales during the year and, with everybody else, had a dreadful first
half in the domestic trade, the company has gone from strength to
strength.

The problems of the power industry led to frantic efforts by the
generators, particularly early in the year, to make up the shortfalls
left by nuclear and gas by burning coal. With additional sales of up to
3mt in its first quarter, RJB effectively kicked off from the penalty
spot and continued to enjoy the misfortunes of the power industry for
the rest of 1995.

Although other companies have complained that RJB was the chief
beneficiary of the increased burn, RJB's biggest achievement has been
the speed with which it adapted to its new position. As one important
source at a generator put it, "the transition (to private ownership)
has been seamless and RJB has been very responsive to our needs".

The vast bulk of the increase in deep-mined output came from RJB. By
May the company was announcing debt reduction well ahead of schedule
(Coal UK 42/9) and in September it confirmed good first half results
with a turnover of #740m on sales of 21mt and output of 18mt (Coal UK
45/17). Full results for 1995 will not be published before March but,
given further stock clearance to 5mt or less since June and more
additional sales to the generators, a turnover of #1,400-1,500m looks
to be on the cards, implying profits of #160m plus and presenting the
probability of almost complete bank debt recovery by the summer. Some
analysts have been upgrading their forecasts of turnover and
profitability to, respectively, #1,500-1,600m and #175m-plus. In
December 1994 RJB predicted pre-tax profits at #119m for 1995.

With another two years of lucrative contract tonnage ahead, RJB's
initial #914m gamble has clearly paid off. After getting a price
reduction of #100m, it paid #700m initially for its acquisition plus
#37m to the government at the end of last year. It will pay another
#77m at the end of this year, #40m six months later and a final #40m at
the end of 1997. It raised #494m in bank debt and #385m in equity while
c. #375m of the bank debt was acquisition finance. To have paid off so
much of the acquisition finance this quickly is a considerable
achievement.

Of the 20 individual pits, the best performers have been Riccall and
Wistow, which easily passed 3mt each for the year, Stillingfleet, which
hit 2.2mt; and Maltby and Welbeck, which both passed 2mt. At a smaller
scale, the Blenkinsopp drift apparently surpassed expectations of
250,000t. Problem mines were Asfordby (see separate story) and Point of
Ayr, whilst Daw Mill is understood to have been disappointing.

Celtic lays sound foundations

For Celtic Energy, progress has been less spectacular but nonetheless
just as encouraging. Last November (Coal UK 47/7) its chief executive
Bryan Riddlestone announced that 25% of the company's senior debt had
already been paid off. Given the heavy venture capital backing for
Celtic's takeover of BC's South Wales interests, a 25% payback was
probably in accordance with expectations. Celtic's financial year will
run from April to March, so the first year will last for 15 months. A
typical year, according to sources close to Celtic will gross turnover
of c. #120m.

Celtic won't say how its doing at the moment but sales are likely to
have been #110-125m in Calendar 1995; comprising those to National
Power, likely to have been 1mt and bringing in c. #35-40m; those to
industry, 750,000t earning #20-25m; exports, 200,000t for #5-10m; and
domestic sales of over 500,000t for over #50m.

Scotland braces for drivage

Scottish Coal was the least successful of the three successor companies
but, even so, sold more than it expected. It did not gain as much from
high generator demand because Scottish Power needed less than had been
expected, but English independent suppliers boosted demand by taking on
Scottish coal to make up for their own shortfalls.

The power link to the English grid remains hamstrung by planning
problems in the north of England and, until these can be overcome,
cannot function at full capacity. The ESI's burn struggled to get above
4mt. Scottish found new sales of low-volatile product to markets
overseas and re-established links with Ireland and Northern Ireland. It
sold significant quantities of industrial and housecoal grades to
English markets.

The company will not comment on its profitability. This is partly
because it, like Celtic, will work in future to an April-March
financial year so this year will last for 15 months. However, it also
has three PLC shareholders - Coal Investments, Savile Gordon and
Waverley Mining Finance - which means that disclosure of financial data
becomes an organisational nightmare. Coal UK's best guess is that the
company managed a turnover of roughly #150m over the 12 months with a
small profit.

It faces, shortly some fairly big investment decisions, funded from
within, because it has to complete converting Longannet to full retreat
mining and it has to access a new set of reserves. A decision to
develop westward under the Forth and north of Airth and Kincardine
looks imminent. Longannet had a poor first half to the year, hitting
geological problems in the late Spring, but has subsequently improved
steadily, particularly with the arrival of its first retreat face.
Scottish's opencast business continues to function smoothly, although
claims from before privatisation continue to divert attention.

Coal Investments' runs before it walks

For Coal Investments 1995 will not be remembered happily. It started
the year as a small scale operation that had failed to secure any of
the BC regions. It had six licensed mines, each in various stages of
development and a small contracts portfolio. It was sticking with its
avowed intention to work each pit as a bord and pillar operation using
continuous miners.

The scale planned had been surprising because BC pits were widely
believed to be expensive to run even before they had any mining
machinery put in them. However, Hem Heath got started early in the year
and looked to be going well, with a continuous miner producing at
200,000t/yr. Silverdale, meanwhile, discovered that it was a coking
coal mine and developed a longwall face aimed at British Steel.

At the same time chief executive Malcolm Edwards busied himself picking
up contracts; the trouble was that he picked up a few too many. By the
middle of the year CI had landed orders to supply: National Power,
2.8mt/yr; PowerGen, 500,000t/yr; Alcan, 200,000t/yr; British Steel,
250,000t/yr; Castle Cement, 400,000t/yr; plus AHS Emstar and NHS
Supplies with singles. CI thus found itself with over 4mt/yr of
business, all running to 1999, and output of less than 1mt/yr.

The development programme, essentially to switch all mine plans to
longwalls, that was then put in place made substantial demands on the
patience of shareholders who had already stumped up #48.5m in pursuit
of profits. Although the CI pits were running at 40-50,000t/week at the
time, they ran into major problems shortly after, with Annesley
Bentinck and Markham Main the main culprits. Having them down and
getting them back on line drained cash from the company just when it
should have been pouring funds into developing Coventry. Consequently
CI arranged a loan facility of up to #30m. In November it breached some
of the conditions of the loan and the banks withdrew their cooperation
and by the end of the year the company was in deep trouble. At the time
of writing Coal Investments looked set to retain the support of the
banks, but at the expense of another rights issue (see separate story).

Betws, Hatfield, Tower: the real niche miners

Three collieries are now run independently; Betws, Hatfield and Tower.
Each has its own management structure and each its own priorities. In
marketing they have each concentrated on specific sectors, aiming to
make a name in ways that the bigger companies cannot easily do. All
three did very well in 1995.

Betws is the oldest of the three and is approaching its second birthday
as an independent operation. It was taken on as a management buy-out
after BC closed it as one of the original 10 no-hopers announced in
October 1992. The mine produced ahead of budget at 110,000t last year
and by March will have mined 200,000t since re-opening. Its manager
Martin Cook says that Betws Anthracite is profitable and that it has
paid off 50% of its debt. Cook will not cite numbers but, at
110,000t/yr, turnover is likely to be #5-8m/yr.

Betws employs 110, working by shot-firing, and runs a prep. plant
supplied by Unifloc. According to Cook, it is likely to turn out the
same volume in 1996 and for the next seven to eight years will stick
with this annual rate. In three years time, Betws plans to start
development work on the Rock seam, which Cook says will add another 10-
15 years to the mine's life. Betws Anthracite has also seen its
marketing relationships change. Its contract with Coal Products for
washed duff remains the same, but CP is now responsible for marketing
the sized output as well, following its takeover of Anglo Coal.

Hatfield Coal Co. is another management buyout. It has rebuilt itself
by the simple expedient of offering the market what it always wanted.
Hatfield's output is very popular because of its high quality,
particularly in the sized grades. It shut, briefly, and had much of its
face gear removed by British Coal, partly because of an appalling
labour record and partly because BC's drive to increase efficiency also
increased the output of fines, which failed to pay their way.

Hatfield now produces much the same as in the days before BC attempted
to make it more efficient - 400,000t/yr (Coal UK 48/6). It works hard
to maximise sized output, using longwall techniques. It went into
profit very quickly, selling sized output through traders and fines
through Transcor. At 400,000t/yr, turnover ought not to be less than
#10m. Its financial year runs from July to June. Last year it made
#1.5m post-tax on an #11.5m turnover and 362,000t production.

Goitre Tower Anthracite is the example that is celebrated by all of the
pundits. With politicians queueing up to take credit for the workers'
buyout's success, the real plaudits should be showered on the workforce
itself. GTA recently announced pre-tax profits of #3.5m for 1995, which
it promptly divided between the work-force and its future investment
fund. It produced 400-450,000t and sold the lot, indicating a turnover
of #12-14m.

South Wales gains one, loses one

For the private mining industry in South Wales the most positive move
was the arrival of a new PLC, Consolidated Coal. This was launched to
run five Neath Valley drift mines, to develop a briquetting works
nearby and subsequently took over the Sarn Helen opencast mine from
Glotec.

Consolidated's arrival closely followed the loss of Ryan Mining. Having
failed to acquire a BC region, Ryan's parent Ryan Group finally
accepted that its debt burden was too high to sustain. It retreated
into Crouch Mining and sold Ryan Mining to NSM for #25m including debt
take-up.

NSM is still swallowing its mouthful and continues to develop the
Pentreclwydau mine that Ryan had driven as far as the pit bottom. Big P
starts coaling commercially in the summer, but it is already producing
development coal. It will be a bord and pillar mine.

The domestic trade turns upside down

The domestic solid fuel business had an awful year, with a warm spring,
very hot summer and mild autumn ensuring that merchant stocks stayed
high. Nevertheless, all of the leading distributors changed hands, or
are doing so.

First to go was Coal Products, sold by BC to its management. The new
company started lucky, having missed a mild winter and geared up to
endure the close season. Within months it bid for Anglo United's solid
fuel businesses and it acquired Anglo Coal, with Hargreaves. Anglo's
efforts to sell Coalite have failed for the time being (see separate
story).

Late in the year British Fuels was sold by BC to its management. It too
struck lucky. BC suffered the pain of a dismal heating year and, when
the management team's Heptagon team took over, the weather turned cold.
BF, like CP, has plenty of ambition and looks set to launch itself at
the domestic gas markets.

Finally, the year ended with the last of the major distribution
companies up for sale, PD Fuels. Its management has gained preferred
bidder status to buy the company from Powell Duffryn and is aiming to
complete within weeks.

THE MARKET: FLATTERING TO DECEIVE

If 1995 was a great year for the UK coal industry, 1996 is the year
when the hangover starts. In England & Wales this year will see the
impact of the full operation of the gas stations that were delayed last
year. It will also be the year when the nuclear industry minces before
its prospective investors. Coal, as a consequence, will be squeezed
and, by the end of the year 12.5mtce of coal-fired power burn will have
been displaced.

As 1996 progresses, 5GW of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant will
start commercial operation. In the first half of the year Barking
Power's Barking Reach (IGW) station, which has already started working,
has an impact. National Power's Little Barford (680MW), one of the
chief problem stations, and Hydro/Norweb's Keadby (680MW), the other
which completes commissioning this month, also come on early in 1996.
Together they will displace 6mtce.

From the summer another 2.5GW will displace 6mtce of coal burn, taking
1995's 52-53mt power station burn down to 40mtce/yr by the end of the
year. The actual burn for the whole of 1996 looks as though it will be
between 42mtce and 46mtce. Assuming that Coal Investments is still
there, it is at about this time that RJB finds that its market is
shrinking but it does not appear to suffer until 1997. CI and the other
private miners will be supplying over 6mt to the generators who will be
importing at least 3mt, leaving RJB with 33-37mtce. Last year RJB
supplied 29mt under contract plus about 6mt of additional supplies.

In 1997 the pace of gas station construction slows, but the effects of
late-1996 stations building up to full power, plus the timing of
commissioning for the scheduled 1997 stations means that by autumn 1997
the full impact of 17.5mtce of lost burn will be felt.

Assuming rival suppliers remain at the same tonnage levels, implies a
demand from RJB's mines of 25mtce/yr, against contracted tonnages of 28-
29mtce/yr. With another 755MW station already under construction for
1998 and a further 2.6GW planned, negotiations on future contracts will
clearly be painful for the suppliers.

M & G TAKES MC PANAMAX

M & G is negotiating to take a panamax-sized cargo of Colombian product
through the Redcar ore terminal. The shipment is expected to be
delivered in February-March and will comprise Carboandes material
loaded at Santa Marta. It is being shipped via MC Coal.

Neither buyer nor trader would comment on the deal, beyond confirming
that talks are underway, but its size has sparked plenty of excitement
and speculation in the trading community. A move up to panamax-sized
trades has long been a cherished ambition of UK importers, described by
one as "inevitable", who have found themselves squeezed by the low
price offers of local suppliers and by Sterling's weakness. Although
handy-sized shipments have come in this winter, for EH Bennett via
Shell and for MacPhail via MC Coal, there has been a growing body of
opinion that such trade is very risky.

Prices for Colombian screening product are unlikely to be below
$36.00/t FOB, basis 12,000Btu GAR. After freight in a handy of well
over $12.00, plus discharge costs, the shipment lands in a UK port at
#34-35.00/t and still has to be moved to a yard and screened. By fixing
a panamax MC will probably shave $3.00 off the freight price,
suggesting a landed #32.50/t.

For M & G, the timing of the deal is also significant because delivery
as late as March indicates that the buyer is not that worried about
missing the housecoal season. By the time that screening can be
completed at the Hartlepool yard the season should be over. There will
be demand from merchants for good quality Colombian material for
stocking but it will not be nearly as keen as during the season.

This suggests that M & G has a different customer in mind, whoever is
buying the fines. It had a major fines customer two years ago in
British Steel, when it sold on products generated by processing La
Jagua coal supplied by Bridge. However, BS presumably lived without
that when Shell and Phibro got the rights to the La Jagua product and
asked M & G a price it wouldn't pay. It also seems unlikely that BS
would be that bothered about securing large volumes of fines anyway
since it viewed the original M & G product as little more than filler
carbon.

Either M & G has a new customer in mind or the finance deal offered by
MC is such that M & G can afford to stock the sized coal for next
winter and let the fines take care of themselves. MC's parent
Mitsubishi has more than a little financial clout.

If it is a new customer then the three obvious choices are ICI,
National Power and PowerGen. ICI looks a good prospect, on the buyer's
doorstep and known to be fond of Colombian product. PG, with its own
supplies of Colombian, looks unlikely. NP is an avid collector of cheap
fines and has stations both north and south of the Tees, but they are a
fair-sized haul away.

PG subsidiary PowerCoal has meanwhile booked freight for its Carbones
del Caribe product (see separate story). One complaint of traders is
that any attempt to bring in alternative supplies of CdC product brings
instant complaints from the utility to its suppliers. Although CdC has
not apparently signed an exclusive deal, the PG business is big enough
it seems to make it effectively so in the UK.

EASTERN SEEKS 500,000T

Eastern Group is on the verge of calling for offers of 500,000t for
delivery to Drakelow and High Marnham power stations in 1996/97. This
is additional tonnage to that supplied to the stations and is thought
to be partly a tester to see what is likely to be available in the
event that Eastern wins its bid for National Power's three station
disposals. It is looking for deliveries from both domestic and overseas
suppliers and is expected to prefer a low sulphur product.

OWENS STARTS NEWCARB

A new company has arisen from the ashes of MG Carbon UK. Using the same
telephone number as MGC, its name is Newcarb and its managing director
is Jeff Owens, former MD of MG Carbon.

The new company has bought the stocks left by MGC at Immingham and
Killingholme and it has bought some of the company's plant. It is
operating at the old MGC base in Sunderland. It will also import
through "Humberside", according to Owens, probably Killingholme where
there is the remnant of a stockpile bought by the company.

Owens' partners in the enterprise are David Horrocks, the financial
director, and Kevin Cornish, operations and industrial sales director.
Both were formerly at MGC.

Newcarb leaves behind the MGC base at Immingham, which was widely felt
in the trade to have been expensive.

MGC went into administrative receivership last October (Coal UK 46/14).
Its debts were described by the administrator as "substantial", albeit
owed primarily to its German parent companies. Other creditors were
expected to receive close to 100p in the pound, thanks partly to the
willingness of the German companies to write off what is owed to them.

Even so, one of the parents, MG Petroleum Coke, has angered traders by
offering product of its own throughout the administration period. It is
not known what MGPC's policy to sales in the north eastern UK will be
from now on.

NP TURNS TO SELF-UNLOADERS

National Power's problems with its continuous unloaders at Tilbury
power station (Coal UK 48/16) forced it to switch to self-unloading
vessels during December and January. Although the Kone-built unloaders
looked set to restart at the time of writing, NP had taken at least
four Jebsen vessels through the terminal and almost certainly more.

NP's problems started when a belt serving the unloader failed. The
utility had thought that it could use some old grab unloaders still at
the port but this proved impossible. It subsequently hired Jebsen to
lift up to 150,000t and it almost certainly paid substantially more, at
least #2/t for Europoort loaders, for the privilege than it would have
done using its normal Stevie Clarke vessels.

NP also took the P & O cape Pytchley through Bristol from New Orleans
and is believed to have been the lead buyer behind the cape SCF
Endurance, which called at Immingham from Hampton Roads. Another cape
at Immingham from Hampton Roads, SKS Banner, may have been shared by
British Steel and NP.

PowerGen handled mainly local tonnage, with Lords Citrine and Hinton
trading to Kingsnorth from the Tees and the Tyne. In addition, Lord
Hinton made an unusual voyage to Kingsnorth from Poland.

Hunterston took a cargo of petroleum coke from Texas City, whilst
another petcoke cargo came into the Tees from Los Angeles. Hunterston
also took a cape for Nigen with Carbocol coal from Puerto Bolivar.

STRATHCLYDE SEEKS 90,000T

Strathclyde Regional Council* has issued a tender for the supply of
45,000t/yr of sized product for 1996 and 1997. This is to supply
offices, schools, colleges and other council buildings with mainly
singles, but also doubles and trebles. Delivery is to be made within
four days of each order, primarily by pneumatic or tipper lorries.
Strathclyde is currently supplied by Scottish Coal via a contract
inherited from British Coal.

Meanwhile, Fife Regional Council has opted to stick with Scottish Coal
for its 3,750t (Coal UK 44/9) to be delivered over two years from
January 1996. It paid #165,000, indicating a price of #44/t for what
was primarily singles grade coal.

* Contact: Head of Purchasing, Strathclyde Regional Council, PO Box
462, Glasgow, G2 4PD. Telephone (0141) 227 3130. Fax (0141) 227 3869.

IMPORTS MOVE 7% AHEAD

Mistakes by HM Customs notwithstanding, steam coal imports of 5.4mt
were 7% ahead of year-ago levels in January-November. This figure could
have been higher were it not for the classification of 123,000t of
imports for PowerGen, through Kingsnorth, as a coking coal. Other
mistakes by Customs put 61,000t of Australian coking coal imported via
Avonmouth for Britannia Zinc at an average #42.31/t in as an anthracite
cargo, along with 71,000t of US coking coal delivered to British Steel
through Immingham and Port Talbot.

Steam coal imports from Colombia retained their leading position, at
2.1mt, but have slipped back to 21% behind year-ago levels. Those from
the US were up threefold at 1.5mt and South African arrivals up by 155%
to 890,000t. All of the other major suppliers are behind, though, with
Polish deliveries down 18% at 600,000t, indicating continued poor
demand for sized material. Russian imports were down 81% at 42,000t and
Australian down 65% to the one cape-load delivered to Hunterston for
Nigen early in 1995.

Coking coal imports, about which there is most confusion thanks to
Customs, are apparently 14% behind a year ago at 6.2mt. The only
exporter to see a rise in shipments to the UK was Canada, which in
January-November supplied 1.25mt and in November alone a panamax-load.
The US has apparently lost ground by 34% to 1.6mt and Australia by 7%
to 3.1mt. However, US supplies have been mis-classified by Customs most
often this year. A more realistic estimate for overall coking coal
imports was 7.9mt, up 6% from 7.4mt.

Anthracite imports were recorded by Customs at 2.6mt, up 77% from a
year ago. However, stripping out the mis-classifications changes the
figure to 860,000t, down 30% from 1.2mt. Imports from Vietnam were down
by 46% at 101,000t and those from South Africa by 18% at 201,000t.
Chinese arrivals grew 33.5% to 77,000t.

Import values continue to climb slowly, although a lack of sized
imports made them lower for steam coal than they should be in November.
Bennett took a 25,000t cargo of Chinese anthracite at an import value
of #62.43/t. A 5,470t cargo of Russian anthracite product, reportedly
landed at Immingham at #41.78, may have been sized bituminous product.
ICF took a 24,000t cargo from Poland at #29.98/t whilst 59,000t of
Colombian landed at Hunterston, presumably for West of Scotland Fuels,
came in at #30.97/t. Other values included a cape of US product at
Avonmouth at #28.99/t and a 115,000t landed through Immingham at an
average #27.05/t. US product coming through London averaged #26.59/t
whilst a Polish handy-sized cargo came through the same port at
#27.68/t.

BRUNNER MOND DROPS COAL

Brunner Mond has abandoned plans to build a 300MW coal-fired power
station at Northwich in Cheshire. Its decision follows a collapse in
gas prices and the takeover by Scottish Power of one of its partners in
the enterprise, Manweb. The plant would have burnt 1mt/yr from 1999
onwards.

OPENCAST NERVES FRAY

Fears are growing that opencast mining is becoming an impossible task
for the vast majority of its practitioners. The private opencast sector
that survived and grew through British Coal's dominance of the coal
industry has found itself in a much tougher world following the
corporation's privatisation. In particular, the disappearance of BC has
added to the pressures coming to bear on the opencasters from planning
authorities. With tightening UK power station fuel prices and growing
anti-development sentiment generally it is becoming more and more
difficult to justify and then proceed with projects.

The chief pressure on new opencast operators is competitive.
Ironically, having produced the cheapest available coal for many years,
opencast is now being undercut by deep-mined coals. More than one
opencaster has expressed the belief to Coal UK that life would be
easier without Coal Investments, for example, because of the latter's
highly competitive pricing strategies. It has won contracts at mine-
mouth prices of 95p-#1.10/GJ, beating many opencasters easily. At the
same time, RJB Mining's costs have come down at some pits to the point
where opencast costs are higher, so the opencasters can thank their
lucky stars that RJB is tied to contracts to March 1998.

Such a tight pricing environment makes it difficult for new operators
to establish themselves but those already strong in the industry are
also finding it tough. For them the situation is different because they
are trying to work to contracts granted them by the generators which
shadow those granted to RJB. The smaller operators get 9.5p/GJ less,
but they can work to these levels profitably, if they can get sites to
work. And it is here that the second biggest problem has surfaced.

For whatever reason, councils have become much more hostile to the
opencast industry. This has been especially the case since the
Heseltine pit closure announcements in October 1992 and since the
government revised minerals planning guidelines a year ago.

It became more than apparent in areas like Leeds and Barnsley where
Coal Contractors and Cobex in particular have had their fingers burnt
chasing what looked to be reasonable opencast proposals. One operator
told Coal UK last week, "South Yorkshire is effectively a no-go area".
Cobex's losses of three sites there in 1995, which had been viewed at
the time as racing certainties, effectively sterilised resources.
Northumberland, possibly the richest opencast county in terms of
reserves, took one look at the closure of its last colliery at
Ellington and announced that no more opencast approvals would be given.
It has calmed down following Ellington's re-opening by RJB but the
atmosphere is definitely cooler than before privatisation.

The thing that has opencasters tearing their hair out most with the
planners is a general sense that the dichotomy between the approaches
of the two sides to the mineral planning guidelines has widened since
MPG-3 was revised. Time after time the complaint to Coal UK is that
councils interpret the rules as they wish to and that, even when their
planning officials recommend approvals, they can and do find reasons to
reject proposals.

And the frustration does not end there. The opencasters complain that
the Department of the Environment is stonewalling them, refusing to
accept even that there is a problem. Environment tells Coal UK that
interpretation is a matter for local authorities.

The cost of submitting planning proposals has also risen sharply. Apart
from the expense involved in preparing environmental assessments
opencasters are still coming round to the likelihood that they will now
have to routinely hire consultants to prepare reports on dust, noise,
interaction with other workings, archaeological acceptability,
hydrology and potential effects on local flora and fauna. There have
even been instances where the local council has taken one look at the
reports prepared and opted to hire its own consultants and to charge
them out to the poor old applicant. Quids in for the consultants but a
terrible waste of the opencaster's resources.

Councils are also clearly a lot less trusting of opencast applicants
now that BC has gone. Here they have taken to asking what guarantees
there are that restorations will be undertaken as pledged when the
coaling has been completed. In the old days BC issued licences and
councils were able to accept the implied word of a state-owned company
that it was ultimately responsible for any clean-up costs. Nowadays
there is no guarantee that there will be anybody to clear up any mess
if an opencaster goes belly up half-way through a job. Coalpro, the
main representative body, is close to strengthening its position as the
industry's voice by approving a bond scheme that will pledge all of its
members to salvaging a site if one of them runs into trouble. Until
then, councils will remain distrustful.

The companies themselves will clearly have their work cut out to gain
planning permissions to meet their contracts with the generators. In
contrast with the three successors of BC, which look very comfortably
placed to expand opencast production, the private miners are looking at
a drastic cut in output unless planning permissions become easier to
win. Coal Contractors, for example, desperately needed to win approval
for the Albion site (see separate story) because its portfolio barely
scraped past the next financial year without it. Clay is chasing sites
well outside of its normal remit, in Scotland and Northumberland. Cobex
has done the same and has also bought a site from another company,
SAFE.

GILLESPIE TO MINE EASTER

Gillespie Group has applied for permission to work a 600,000t site at
Easter Balbeggie Farm in Kirkcaldy. It will work the site over five
years and will reclaim a scrap yard on the site. Gillespie has been
marketing the coal for some time and is thought to have a sales
agreement with Transcor.

Also in Scotland, Procoal has applied for permission to work the
160,000t Devonside site near Saline in Dunfermline. It will mine for
three years.

MAIDENS HALL LOOKS HOPEFUL

RJB's Maidens Hall planning application, submitted to Northumberland
County Council by British Coal before privatisation, goes before the
council's planning committee on February 5. This is for a 3.5mt site to
be worked over six years. The site is north of Stobswood and, in
planning terms, looks as though it should go through. It would feed its
output through the Butterwell disposal point. Maidens Hall is adjacent
to Colliersdean and will use the latter's void for its overburden. The
coal is of very high quality (26.6GJ/t, sulphur 1.2%) and will be
produced at low cost.

GOLIGHTLY MINES AT HOME

Golightly has applied for permission to work the West Lodge Farm site,
near its home base in Shildon, County Durham. This is a 10.5 hectare
site with 100,000t of reserves which will be mined over 12 months. The
land will be restored to agricultural use, apart from a one hectare
area which has been allocated in the Sedgewick district plan for
industrial use. Golightly will cite the industrial site as likely to
sterilise any coal deposits. The company will also stabilise ground
which has been mined previously.

BANKS APPLIES FOR PITHOUSE WEST

HJ Banks has applied for permission to work a 280,000t opencast site
which includes 50,000t of fire clay, adjacent to its current 190,000t
North Wood site. If approved, work at Pithouse West will begin early in
1998, as North Wood finishes. The latter's void will take the
overburden of the former.

Pithouse West is a 73 hectare site, including the 42 hectares covered
by North Wood, and will be worked in the same way as its predecessor.
Banks will use the woodland in which the sites are operated to screen
off its working and will restore the whole area to commercial woodland
on completion. Coaling will take 26-29 months. The output will almost
certainly follow North Wood's product to the generators.

EUROPE TIGHTENS EA NEEDS

The government has reportedly agreed to amendments to the European
Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which will tighten the
planning requirements on UK opencasters.

At the moment only planners proposing sites which cover more than 50
hectares, c. 250,000t of reserves, are obliged to submit an assessment
of their proposals' impact on the environment. The new adoptions will
mean that sites covering 25 hectares and upwards will be obliged to do
this.

In practice, the legislation is merely catching up with current
professional practices since most opencasters have already accepted the
need to submit EA reports for sites this small.

COALCO CLOSES ON ALBION

The plans of a joint venture of Coal Contractors, Hepworth and Leigh
Environmental to develop the 1.5mt Albion site, with a following
landfill operation, has been given the green light by Leicestershire
County Council's environment committee.

Albion is one of the most complex opencast sites to have emerged. It is
part of a long established clay exploitation region; Hepworth runs a
clay works on the site, which is close to Ashby de la Zouch. It has
been the subject of intense consultation between the county, British
Coal and assorted minerals exploitation companies.

The CoalCo plan, which goes before a full council meeting on January
31, envisages the exploitation of the coal over four to five years
followed by a landfill by Leigh over 17 years. It is the latter that
has aroused the most local opposition. There is, say council officials,
"major dereliction" in the area, and granting the planning permission
would entail its restoration, which will start very early in the site's
working. If the deal is rejected by the council, then BC and the DTI
stand to fork out #20m or more restoring the site, since BC created
much of the dereliction there. Given CoalCo's recent problems getting
permissions for sites, coaling is likely to start as soon as possible,
once planning permission is granted. (Although there are stocks of clay
still on the site, the mineral is largely worked out. There is only a
small amount of muck to be shifted to expose the first coal and mining
can begin within months of gaining permits from the relevant
authorities.)

As a part of the deal the main land-owner, British Coal, will
relinquish interest in other reserves in the area at Hanging Hill and
Pick. RJB Mining's former Moira interest has also been bought by Leigh.

RJB's nearby Minorca site, 750,000t, is unaffected by the likely Albion
approval and is expected to go before the county planning officers
early in the summer. There are also thought to be other reserves close
to Moira which are unaffected by the Albion site.

ASFORDBY: DELAYED TO SUMMER?

RJB's Asfordby mine looks as though it could be virtually out of action
for up to six months. The pit has been having problems since last
spring when a roof fall took out the main conveyor belt. Now it is also
suffering from compression problems and, apparently, from water. The
flooding has been beaten back but the other problems remain.

Asfordby has long been viewed as a potential problem pit, but more
because of the poor quality of its coal, barely 22GJ/t net, and
prodigious ash levels, than engineering. Although the mine itself was
never envisaged before privatisation as likely to be problem-free, its
developers were always confident that technology could overcome any
problems before production began. When the 530 metre shafts were sunk,
BC overcame the severe water problems associated with the Keuper
Waterstones and Bunter sandstones by constructing a freeze chamber.

Asfordby was developed by British Coal as a multi-entry retreat face
pit, to very modern standards, and RJB simply carried on with BC's
development plan. However, mining engineers that have seen the problems
that have developed there have likened the pit to "another Wistow".
Wistow is now RJB's star performer but it soaked up millions before BC
got it to its current state.

The Asfordby mine was initially planned as a 4-5mt/yr super-pit. BC
subsequently dropped plans to exploit the Parkgate seam and
concentrated on working the Deep Main seam at 2.2mt/yr.

RAIL-FREIGHT GOES FOR $400M

Wisconsin Central has the lead in the race to take over the UK's bulk
rail freight businesses (Coal UK 48/7). It is the Department of
Transport's preferred bidder after making a combined bid of $400m
(#265m), including $47m (#31m) for the REs business that runs the mail
trains.

It is now circulating the US financial institutions seeking backing for
its bid. It beat a consortium of Loadhaul and Omnitrax for its prize.
Also-rans were Mainline and Transrail.

POWERCOAL FIXES 1996 FREIGHT

PowerGen subsidiary PowerCoal has covered the bulk of its freight
requirements for deliveries of the Carbones de Caribe product that it
imports from Colombia through Liverpool. It will pay $10.50 to French
shipowner Cetragpa for six 55,000t shipments of screening/washing
product from Cartagena and Santa Marta. It also has the option, at
$10.80, to load in Cartagena only. Shipments will be spread evenly
through 1996 and there may be one or two additional cargoes fixed later
in the month.

STERLING SUPPORTS SHORT SEA RATES

A slow short sea freight market saw little movement in rates in dollar
terms but the weakness of Sterling meant that UK importers ended up
paying slightly more in January than in December.

London broker Galbraith reports: "if anything, a slight downward trend"
in rates at the moment. This has been caused by severe ice conditions
in the Baltic Sea which has forced tonnage south in search of cargoes.
According to Galbraith, "fresh coal business is in very short supply".
Rates are expected to remain static while the severe weather retains
its hold. When the thaw starts, though, a rush of tonnage northwards is
likely to spark a recovery.

In the deep sea sector, freights are still very soft. London broker
Clarkson says that a cape can be hired for Rotterdam discharge at $6.10
from the US east coast, for $6.00 (#4.00) from Puerto Bolivar in
Colombia and for $5.15 from Richards Bay in South Africa. In each case
these rates are about the same as month ago levels but a good $1-2
lower than three months ago.

Deep sea shipments booked to the UK and Ireland included the PowerGen
tonnage which is detailed separately. Amongst the individual shipments
in January, a Mitsui vessel was booked by Korean company Keoyang from
Puerto Bolivar to Moneypoint with 130,000t at $5.50. A Keoyang vessel
was later let to Ireland's Electricity Supply Board for a journey from
La Cienaga (Drummond's La Loma) in Colombia at $5.85-5.90 for a
110,000t cargo. Cobelfret booked a panamax from Santa Marta to
Hunterston, presumably residual 1995 Phibro business, at $9.50 for end-
January loading. A British Steel-bound panamax was booked by Lorentzen
from Roberts Bank to Port Talbot at c. $12.00, at least $1.50 down on
last done business and a panamax was taken from Gladstone to Immingham
at $12.95.

CI WINS BANKS' SUPPORT?

Coal Investments looks as though it will live to fight another day. At
the time of writing, its three main bankers looked set to maintain
support for the company but also to insist on a rights issue. This can
probably not happen until March. The company got great support from its
work-force who turned out to cut coal during the Christmas holiday.

It is expected to make some personnel changes. Former-ICI Paints chief
executive Herman Scopes joins the company as a non-executive director
and a new chief executive has apparently been lined up. It is not known
what current chief executive Malcolm Edwards' future position will be,
but the company has apparently successfully argued that there is still
an active role for him.

SHARES HOLD UP

Coal company shares continue to behave as though the problems of Coal
Investments did not exist, assuaging fears that they might be tripped
up by a knock on effect. Shares in RJB Mining traded at 555-560p
throughout the month, although brokers expectations of the company's
results appear to be improving.

Smaller company equity values hardly changed, with NSM steady at 77p,
Rackwood at 47p and Consolidated Coal at 50-60p. Waverley Mining
Finance, which recently put a financial package together to take over
Monktonhall Mining, saw rises in January from the low 100s to 110-115p.

Other energy shares were quiet, with the exception of Scottish Power
and Powell Duffryn. SP's price recovered to 385p after bullish news
about its takeover of Manweb was released. PD saw shares recover from
their recent low levels, rising from 430p to 450p on prospective
subsidiary disposals.

COALITE TALKS COLLAPSE

Anglo United and Apax Partners have stopped negotiations that would
have taken Coalite into the hands of a management team backed by Apax.
Anglo is now apparently refusing to discuss the company with
prospective buyers. The talks stalled on price but all prospective
buyers had also expressed concerns about potential environmental
problems.
