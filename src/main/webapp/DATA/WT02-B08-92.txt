<H1>GENDER DIFFERENCES IN MENTAL DISORDERS<BR>
<HR></H1>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A LEADING American psychiatrist, Dr Carol Nadelson, said in Melbourne today
that too much of the treatment for mental disorders had been based on studies
of white males.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There has been a tendency to take some women's symptoms and complaints
less seriously and assume they are hormonally related,&quot; she said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most medical research, including psychiatry, has been on white males.
They were seen as the models out of which you could extrapolate to the general
community, regardless of gender, racial group or other factors. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But we don't know how much is accounted for biologically or hormonally,
or how much is the result of psycho-social and other factors.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For instance, there is a higher instance of major depression among
women than among men (a ratio of 5.7 to 2.7), but it is not explained by
any one factor, hormonal or otherwise.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Dr Nadelson, who is attending the World Congress of CINP (Collegium Internationale
Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum), is professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical
School and president of the American Psychiatric Press.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Over the past decade there has been an attempt to establish the effects
of gender and other differences,&quot; she said. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the United States it is now mandatory, in seeking renewal of medical
research grants, to use both female and male subjects or to specify why
not.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
She said examples where gender differences needed particular study were
schizophrenia (which tended to occur earlier in men than in women), alcoholism
(despite their higher tolerance, men greatly outnumbered women) and eating
disorders (men were sometimes overlooked because the disorder was far more
common in women).<BR>
