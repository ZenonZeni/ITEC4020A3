Hong Kong bank granted branch status 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Deborah Shen

     The Ministry of Finance on Oct. 15 approved a proposal by the
Bank of East Asia, Hong Kong's largest bank, to upgrade its
representative office in Taiwan to branch status.
     The BEA is the first bank with mainland Chinese investment to be
permitted into the Taiwan market. Also, it is only the second Hong
Kong-based bank allowed to set up a branch on the island. The first
such branch was opened in 1984 by the Hongkong Bank, also known as
the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd.
     But as the Hongkong Bank relocated its headquarters to London
several years ago, the BEA can be seen as the only bank truly
headquartered in Hong Kong to operate a branch here on the island,
the ministry noted.
     The ministry expects that approval of the BEA's upgrade proposal
will encourage the Hong Kong government to gradually give the green
light to each of the seven similar proposals made by Taiwan-based
banks. The Taiwan banks have applied to either set up representative
offices in the British colony or upgrade their existing offices there
to branch status.
     The BEA had applied to the ministry more than a year ago to
upgrade its representative office, which was set up in Taiwan in
April 1993. But as the bank failed to meet the ministry's request for
concrete data on its mainland Chinese ties, the ministry postponed
approval of the application.
     The move in turn caused the Hong Kong government to also delay
approval of the applications by the seven Taiwan-based banks,
according to the ministry.
     The situation improved a few months ago when the BEA presented a
list of its shareholders to the ministry. After reviewing the
information, the ministry decided to approve the upgrade proposal, as
it was determined that the mainland Chinese stake accounts for only
11.77 percent of the bank's total capital. The figure is well below
the 20 percent ceiling imposed by the ROC government.
     However, because the BEA is a listed company, it is possible
that the percentage of mainland Chinese-owned shares could increase
over time. Thus, if the 20 percent ceiling should ever be exceeded,
the ministry said it will have to consult with the Mainland Affairs
Council at that time on how to handle the case.
     As of the end of 1995, the BEA had capital assets totaling
US$1.1 billion, ranking the bank as Hong Kong's largest. The bank has
74 branches in Hong Kong, in addition to six more branches and five
representative offices in mainland China.

Taiwan outward investment ranks as 2nd highest in Asia 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Kelly Her

     Taiwan's outbound investment last year ranked as the second
highest in Asia, according to a United Nations report cited locally
by the Council for Economic Planning and Development.
     Outward investment by Asian countries and territories in 1995
amounted to US$43 billion, representing 90 percent of such investment
by developing countries worldwide, the CEPD said, referring to the
report.
     Hong Kong was Asia's top supplier of foreign capital last year,
investing US$25 billion abroad, mainly in mainland China.
     Taiwan placed second with outbound investment totaling US$3.8
billion. Mainland China ranked third with US$3.5 billion, South Korea
fourth with US$3 billion and Malaysia fifth with US$2.6 billion.
     The same report noted that the mainland not only was the third
largest foreign investor in Asia, but was also the region's top
foreign investment site.
     But the pace of foreign capital coming into the mainland is
expected to slow after hitting a peak this year due to the mainland's
implementation of credit-tightening measures and gradual phasing out
of preferential treatments for foreign investors. Foreign investment
in the mainland is projected to fall below US$30 billion in 1997.
     However, the report said the mainland investment by Japan, South
Korea and the European Union will likely increase despite the general
slowdown.
     The report noted that as long as the mainland enjoys rapid
economic growth and opens new investment fields, it will remain a
major foreign investment site.
     According to the report, worldwide investment in developing
countries last year accumulated to US$99.7 billion on impressive 15
percent annual growth. Two-thirds of this investment capital headed
to Asia, with the mainland absorbing the most, or 38 percent.
     Investment capital injected into Asian countries from throughout
the world reached US$65 billion in 1995, representing an increase of
21 percent from a year before. Ninety percent of the investment funds
were destined for Southeast Asia and East Asia.
     Foreign investment during the year in the mainland, Malaysia and
Singapore reached US$37.5 billion, US$5.8 billion and US$5.3 billion,
respectively. Projects in Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong totaled
US$4.5 billion, US$2.3 billion and US$2.1 billion, respectively.

High-speed railway bidding to open 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Kelly Her

     The Ministry of Transportation and Communications is scheduled
to make a public announcement at the end of October inviting private
firms to participate in Taiwan's high-speed railway project.
     Different from in the past, the ministry will divide the bidding
into two phases by first selecting qualified applicants and then
conducting thorough evaluations of their detailed investment plans.
     Qualified applicants must possess considerable financial assets
and technological capabilities. On the financial side, a bidder needs
to have either a minimum paid-in capital of US$363 million or annual
revenues of more than US$1.09 billion. Sound financial performance
over the past three years is also required of an applicant.
     The ministry's guidelines permit several companies to pool their
efforts and bid collectively in the form of an alliance. An alliance
bid must have a combined paid-in capital of at least US$363 million.
Each investor in the partnership is required to have paid-in capital
totaling US$72 million or more.
     The 330-kilometer rail will provide an express link between
Taipei, the northern business center of the island, and Kaohsiung, a
major port city in the south. The high-speed transportation system is
slated to become operational by the year 2003.
     As designed, the large-scale railway project will cost around
US$16 billion. Also, it has been decided that private capital must
account for more than 40 percent, or US$6.42 billion, of the
project's total investment.
     Participation is open to private firms on a
build-operate-transfer basis. The categories available for private
investment include rail installation, station construction,
electrical engineering and maintenance operations.
     As such, the project is expected to add vigor to Taiwan's
construction, electrical engineering and financial service sectors by
bringing ample business opportunities to them.
     But opportunities exist in more than only the construction
phase. Private firms will also have the opportunity to take charge of
the management, operation and maintenance of the transportation
system after its completion, according to the ministry's Provisional
Engineering Office of the High-Speed Rail.
     This aspect explains why such strict financial conditions have
been imposed on bidders, the office noted.
     In the days ahead, the office plans to organize several
investment seminars targeting leading domestic and foreign
conglomerates in an effort to spur their eagerness to participate in
the high-speed railway project.

Visa's card for stored value introduces electronic cash 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p8

by Deborah Shen

     Visa International Service Association will cooperate with eight
banks in Taiwan to issue "Visa Cash" cards on the island at the
beginning of next year.
     The move will mark the first entry of an international-standard,
microchip-based, stored-value purchasing card into the Taiwan market.
In addition, it also ushers in a new era of purchasing with
electronic cash in Taiwan, according to Visa, which already issues
the No. 1 credit card on the island.
     The U.S.-based company and the eight local banks held a joint
news conference in Taipei on Oct. 15 to announce the launching in
Taiwan of a Visa Cash pilot program. The partnership expects that
200,000 disposable Visa Cash cards will be available on the market in
early 1997.
     So-called Visa Cash is an alternative purchasing medium for
everyday low-value products and services like newspapers, bus fares
and cups of coffee. The microchip embedded in the stored-value card
automatically deducts the amount of each purchase to keep track of
the card's remaining value.
     "Visa Cash will revolutionize the way Taiwan people pay for
small-value purchases," according to Raymond Chan, executive vice
president and general manager of Visa's North Asia, Asia-Pacific
region.
     As cardholders do not need to authorize transactions by using
personal identification numbers or signing their signatures, Visa
Cash is nearly as convenient to use as regular currency, Chan noted.
     Since Visa launched a pilot program in Hong Kong in August of
this year, more than 100,000 Visa Cash cards have been issued in the
British colony, according to the company executive.
     Chan said Taiwan is an ideal market for the service, as the
average local consumer spends about US$7,275 annually on daily
necessities.
     The eight local banks participating in the program include
Citibank, Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Standard Chartered Bank,
International Commercial Bank of China, Chung Shing Bank, Far Eastern
International Bank, Grand Commercial Bank and Taishin International
Bank.
     In the first phase of the Taiwan pilot, the eight banks will
issue 200,000 disposable Visa Cash cards in denominations of NT$1,000
(about US$36) and NT$500, according to Albert Shiung, vice president
of Visa International Asia-Pacific and the company's country manager
in Taiwan.
     Shiung further explained that the success of the initial phase
will lead to the issuance of value-reloadable purchasing cards.
     The firm said 5,000 Visa Cash purchase-processing devices will
be installed at convenience stores, food courts in department stores,
fast-food restaurants and supermarkets across Taiwan.

A booster shot for democracy 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p6

by FCJ Editors

     The National Development Conference scheduled for December holds
out promise for the continued advance of democracy in the Republic of
China on Taiwan. But much work must be done beforehand to ensure that
the forum concentrates on the promotion of genuine political
communication. Five days, while a fair amount of time for
brainstorming ideas, can rush by in a blur when it comes to searching
for agreement on bedrock issues.
     Fortunately, work began weeks ago. A Presidential Office task
force established a broad-based preparatory committee to organize the
conference, and seminars throughout the Taiwan area have been planned
to sound out grassroots opinion before the forum actually convenes
Dec. 23 in Taipei. The preparatory committee's initial work has been
hopeful. On Oct. 11, committee members from all three major parties
agreed on an ambitious aim for the conference: to build a consensus
on the major topics of future national development in order to
formulate policies and put them into practice.
     The three main topics--constitutional reform and party politics,
economic development, and relations between Taiwan and mainland
China--have fundamental importance. ROC parliamentary bodies, though
crucibles of democratic debate, sometimes cannot escape gridlock. The
economy has been sluggish. And intermediary agency talks between
Taiwan and mainland China have been on hold for 16 months. Sharply
contested political issues cluster in thickets around all of these
topics. The 150 conference delegates, meeting outside established
government structures, will attempt to break pathways into the clear.
     President Lee Teng-hui introduced the idea of the National
Development Conference in his inaugural address May 20, and the
meeting of course has a historic precedent. In the summer of 1990,
after his first-term inauguration, Lee convoked the similarly named
National Affairs Conference. It gave birth to several agreements that
built the framework for Taiwan's democratization, such as the direct
election of the provincial governor and Taipei and Kaohsiung mayors.
     In addressing the preparatory committee last week, Lee set the
tone for the forthcoming conference. He pointed out that national
development reached a new stage with the direct presidential election
this year and asserted that "how to concentrate the experience and
wisdom of our people" is the key to the future.
     The ROC's political landscape has indeed changed in six years.
New democratic institutions are in place. The rule of law has been
strengthened. The government is more representative and more
responsive. Yet progress, while it leaves old roads behind, also
presents new and uncharted regions ahead. The National Development
Conference can at the very least help light the way.

Religious group scandal leads to cult crackdown 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p4

by Christie Su

     ROC law enforcement agencies have launched an island-wide
crackdown on religious cults whose illegal activities threaten social
stability and undermine public morality in Taiwan.
     The operation targets religious cults and temples across Taiwan
which are not registered with the government, swindle money out of
followers through fraudulent means, or have ties to gangster
organizations.
     Moreover, the Interior Ministry has announced its intention to
establish an interministerial task force that will focus on
strengthening the management of affairs related to civilian groups on
the island.
     The various measures are part of the government's wide-ranging
war on crime. The cleanup campaign comes in the wake of a major
religious scandal involving "supernatural" shenanigans, political
figures, gangsters, enormous sums of money, and thousands of duped
people in Taiwan and in mainland China.
     The scandal surfaced last week when Taipei City Councilor Chu
Mei-feng accused a Taipei-based cult, the Sung Chi-li Miracle
Association, of swindling money from people.
     Chu, a member of the New Party, announced in an Oct. 9 press
conference that she had received complaints from around 40 people who
claimed cult leader Sung Chi-li had cheated money from them through
fraudulent acts.
     Meanwhile, several association members went to the police with
similar charges against Sung.
     Councilwoman Chu also named Frank Hsieh, the Democratic
Progressive Party's vice presidential candidate in the elections this
past March, as being associated with the cult. Moreover, Hsieh, a
former legislator, was accused of having received about US$580,000 in
campaign donations from cult leader Sung.
     Hsieh, however, denied receiving any such donations and
clarified that his only tie to the association is that he has served
as its legal consultant.
     It was also reported that some government officials in Taiwan,
including the deputy director-general of the National Police
Administration, Yu Yu-tang, might be associated with the mystic cult.
     On Oct. 10, the Miracle Association issued a statement refuting
all charges against it. The statement emphasized that the association
was a registered private organization devoted to helping people by
teaching them how to discover their real selves through philosophical
learning. The group further stressed that it had no links to illegal
businesses.
     But an extensive police investigation and an explosion of media
coverage on the case suggested otherwise, resulting in the arrest of
Sung and several core members of the association on fraud charges.
     The police investigation revealed that the cult leader, whose
real name is Sung Chien-lin, had a string of previous convictions on
fraud and violations of the so-called negotiable instruments law.
     Using trick photography, Sung had convinced his association
members that he possessed the ability to separate his body and soul
and miraculously manifest himself at different points on the globe
simultaneously. This purported supernatural power of his can be used
to help his followers ascend to paradise after death, he had claimed.
     But during police interrogations a few days after the scandal
broke, Sung finally admitted that the manifestation photos were fakes
and he did not possess any supernatural powers.
     Police reports said Sung had bilked association members out of
about US$7 million. The illegal fortune was amassed through several
sources: the sale of books, video tapes and photographs about Sung's
so-called miraculous manifestations, donations from the cult leader's
followers, and fees Sung charged to people who wanted to meet him in
person to learn how to develop supernatural powers for themselves.
     Reportedly, one photograph showing a haloed image of Sung
floating in the sky above a range of mountains was purchased by a
cult follower for US$3,000. Personal meetings with Sung, however,
came with a price tag of US$363,000 each, according to media reports.
     The ill-gotten gains afforded Sung a luxurious lifestyle. He
reportedly had vast real estate holdings, including the elaborately
decorated association temple. The gaudy-looking temple has since been
razed by the Taipei City Government for building code violations.
     Taipei police authorities also have alleged that Sung and his
association maintained links to underworld organizations.
     Police reports said Sung's group set up money-soliciting
branches in mainland China as well as Taiwan. Members of the mainland
branches included college professors and ranking Chinese Communist
officials.
     The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office said it has frozen the
assets of the association pending completion of the investigation.
     Hsieh, the former lawmaker accused of receiving political
donations from the association, on Oct. 14 filed slander charges
against Councilwoman Chu.
     News analysts suggested that the allegations of Hsieh's close
relations with the cult will probably become a hindrance in his
political future. Hsieh had recently announced that he wanted to run
for the mayor's office in Kaohsiung in two years.
     The campaign to ensure propriety in religious activities also
includes inviting religious leaders in Taiwan to discuss how to break
down potentially harmful superstitions in society, said Chao Shou-po,
secretary-general of the Executive Yuan.

Open telecom door prompts a surge 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by Kelly Her

     The opening of Taiwan's telecommunications market has encouraged
leading foreign investors to launch new projects on the island,
resulting in a dramatic rise in the overall inward investment during
September.
     Approved investments in Taiwan by foreign nationals and overseas
Chinese in September totaled US$345 million, a sharp rise of 78
percent over the previous month.
     In its report, the Investment Commission of the Ministry of
Economic Affairs attributed the surge in inward investment to the
liberalization of Taiwan's telecommunications market.
     Representing the biggest of September's foreign-funded
telecommunications projects, the Taiwan affiliate of U.S.-based
Southwest Bell Corp. funneled US$123 million into a joint venture on
the island.
     As for in the first nine months of the year, the Investment
Commission approved 344 foreign investment projects on the island, up
15 percent from the same period of the previous year. These projects
were valued at US$1.64 billion, down 5 percent from the year-earlier
level.
     Despite a downturn in sales in the semiconductor sector, the
electronics and electrical products industry still attracted the most
foreign investment of all industries in Taiwan in the
January-September period. Even so, the industry's investment total
was a substantial 50 percent lower than the year-earlier total, the
commission reported.
     The period's other leading investment areas included the
island's banking and insurance, wholesale and retail, food and
beverage, and service industries. Together with the electronics and
electrical products industry, these industries accounted for 55
percent of the total inward investment between January and September.
     The commission said the government's campaign to build Taiwan
into an Asian Pacific operations hub is helping to attract foreign
investment into the five industries.
     Looking at September's outbound investment in areas besides
mainland China, the commission's report said Taiwan enterprises
poured US$156 million into 32 projects overseas. The value figure
represented a hefty 62 percent increase over the non-mainland
outbound investment of the same month a year ago.
     In the first nine months of the year, non-mainland outward
investment by Taiwan firms climbed to US$1.49 billion, up an
impressive 49 percent from the year-earlier period.
     The most popular investment areas of the Taiwan firms were the
banking and insurance, electronics and electrical products, and
service industries. Projects in the three industries made up 62
percent of the island's total outbound investment between January and
September.
     A particularly strong increase was noted in Taiwan firms'
establishment of investment holding companies overseas in the period.
The commission said this was a reflection of the trend by the
island's investors to update their information and technologies as a
means of accelerating their internationalization and bolstering their
competitiveness.
     The report also evaluated investment targeted at the other side
of the Taiwan Straits. In September, the commission gave the green
light to only 16 mainland investment proposals filed by local firms,
a decrease of 48 percent from the number of proposals in August and a
record single-month low.
     The aggregate value of September's mainland projects was US$46.4
million, down 62 percent from August and the lowest value in 20
months.
     The slowdown indicates that the mainland investment fever of
Taiwan enterprises has subsided significantly in response to
President Lee Teng-hui's call for the government to review its policy
on cross-Straits business exchanges, according to the commission.
     In the first nine months of the year, the number of approved
mainland proposals decreased 24 percent from the year-earlier period.
However, the value figure increased 15 percent. The commission
attributed this phenomenon to the fact that the average size   of
Taiwan companies' mainland projects is getting bigger, even though
the number of projects is dwindling.
     In an attempt to lure more foreign capital to the island, the
Economics Ministry has targeted 10 newly developing industries in
Taiwan for active investment promotion. The 10 include the consumer
electronics, communications, precision machinery, semiconductors,
aerospace, pharmaceuticals, high-end materials, health care
equipment, pollution prevention equipment, and bio-technology
industries.
     Chou Yen, director-general of the ministry's Industrial
Development and Investment Center, said the IDIC will encourage
foreign firms to inject capital into these industries.
     To help formulate measures for promoting such investment, the
center will survey foreign firms already operating on the island to
see whether they plan to launch new or expansion projects, he added.
     Also, the center already has sent out correspondences to leading
firms around the world, introducing Taiwan's investment environment
to them and inviting them to gear up local projects, Chou said.
     Ministry statistics show that since 1952 a total of 7,705
foreign-invested projects, worth around US$36 billion, have been
approved by the government.

Production drain to mainland 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by FCJ Editors

     Thirty percent of the Taiwan investors with projects in mainland
China have completely ceased production here on the island, according
to a survey report released Oct. 14 by the ROC Mainland Affairs
Council.
     The council commissioned the Chinese Professional Management
Association of Taipei to conduct the survey on some 300 Taiwan
investors on the mainland.
     According to the survey, many of the investors who no longer
manufacture their products in Taiwan continue to receive export
orders and conduct research and development work here on the island.
     However, about 10 percent of Taiwan's mainland investors have
withdrawn their operations from the island entirely. Of these
companies, 40 percent are now engaged in agriculture, fishery or
mining on the mainland. Many others operate service businesses there.
     More than 60 percent of the investors surveyed are focusing on
the mainland's domestic market.
     Some 89 percent of those surveyed said they continue to purchase
the materials they need for mainland production from plants in
Taiwan. However, a declining trend is foreseen, as half of the
investors said they plan to reduce their Taiwan materials purchases
in the days ahead. Explaining the reason for the expected change,
they noted that more upstream and midstream Taiwan factories are
deciding to relocate to the mainland.
     About 30 percent of those surveyed said they think the products
they produce in Taiwan and on the mainland are of the same level of
quality. This is seen as a sign that the production technology on the
mainland has improved.

UPS opens regional center 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by FCJ Editors

     The U.S.-based courier United Parcel Service opened its
Asia-Pacific regional center at the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport on Oct. 10.
     UPS said the northern Taiwan center will bolster its service
to regional customers and eventually hook up with the company's
European base to form a worldwide delivery network. More than that,
the opening of the first phase of the UPS center is seen as a step
toward Taiwan becoming a regional air shipping hub.
     The inauguration of the US$400 million center, however, was
marred by a demonstration by 100 members of the Taipei Air Cargo and
Warehousing Industrial Union, who said the inroad gained by UPS will
enable the U.S. firm to seriously undermine their businesses.
     The union companies said the privileges granted to UPS will
enable the major international courier to elbow many of them out of
the market. This, in turn, will result in closures and the loss of
local jobs, they warned.
     UPS is the first foreign express courier that the government has
permitted to establish an Asia-Pacific freight center on the island.
The company also has been given special treatment, including 24-hour
customs clearance and quarantine and certification services.
     In December, UPS filed an application to set up the
multimillion-dollar center at the CKS airport. The government gave
the green light earlier this year despite protests from local
couriers which feared they would not be able to compete with the U.S.
delivery giant.

WTO talks end with Australia 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p3

by Deborah Shen

     Following 14 rounds of bilateral negotiations, the ROC has
finally reached a consensus with Australia on the terms applicable to
the ROC's bid to enter the World Trade Organization.
     Australia now becomes the 11th WTO member country to have
completed bilateral talks with the ROC on membership terms, Lin
Yi-fu, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade, said.
     The two sides are expected to sign an accord on the agreed-upon
package of entry terms in the next few weeks. The finalized accord
will help speed up the ROC's admission into the trade body, Lin said.
     Lin was the chief ROC negotiator in what now appears to have
been the final round of WTO talks with Australia. During the Oct. 7-8
negotiations in Taipei, the two sides failed to resolve a major
sticking point which had lingered since the bilateral talks began
several years ago. That would be the ROC's tariff rate on imports of
Australian beef.
     At the conclusion of the Taipei negotiations, the Australian
delegation, headed by Graeme Thomason, said it would need to consult
with its government on proposals made by the ROC in the meetings. The
proposals included reductions on the tariffs which the ROC applies to
imports of Australian beef.
     Australia is the largest source of imported beef in Taiwan.
According to the Council of Agriculture, the island imported more
than 57,000 metric tons of beef and beef products last year, of which
about 30,000 metric tons came from Australia.
     Even so, Australian negotiators have long complained in the
bilateral WTO meetings that the ROC applies discriminatory treatment
to imports of Australian beef. In that the ROC classifies imported
beef from the United States as "special grade" and beef from
Australia as "ordinary grade," the Australian product falls into a
category with a higher tariff. This makes Australian beef less
competitive in the Taiwan market, they noted.
     Currently, the ROC government taxes special-grade imported beef
at a rate of NT$22.1 (US$0.80) per kilogram. Ordinary-grade imported
beef faces a duty of NT$30 (US$1.09) per kilogram.
     The ROC's initial stance was that it would not cut tariffs on
imported agricultural products until after gaining membership in the
WTO. The nation's negotiators decided to yield ground, however,
following President Lee Teng-hui's call for WTO talks with related
countries to be completed by next March so that the ROC can enter the
trade body before Hong Kong goes over to mainland China rule in July
1997.
     The nation's negotiators drew up a package of WTO entry terms,
adding in a key element--the beef tariff reductions long sought by
Australia. The proposal was presented to the Australian delegation
during the Taipei meetings in an effort to secure Australia's full
support of the membership bid.
     On Oct. 11, Australia notified the ROC that it had decided to
accept the beef tariff reductions as well as the rest of the entry
terms. The package of proposals is expected to boost the value of
Australia's overall exports to Taiwan by US$23.7 million annually.
     Under the accepted terms, the ROC will cut its tariffs on
Australian beef by 10 percent, lowering the duty from the current
NT$30 (US$1.09) per kilogram to NT$27 (US$0.98) per kilogram before
being admitted into the WTO. After membership is gained, the ROC will
further cut the beef tariffs over a period of six years to NT$15
(US$0.55) per kilogram.
     In other areas besides beef imports, ROC negotiators also agreed
to open the Taiwan market to 2,000 Australian-made compact cars for
the first time ever, beginning in 1997. After membership in the WTO
is granted, the quota will be gradually increased to 6,000 cars.
     The ROC also promised to double the annual import quota of 1,200
metric tons of Australian apples and allow Australian peaches, plums
and oranges to enter the Taiwan market for the first time ever, at
annual quotas ranging from 600 to 1,000 metric tons.
     The package of membership terms also includes measures to open
up Taiwan's financial and legal services and other service markets.
     The ROC applied to join the WTO's predecessor, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in 1990 under the name "Customs
Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." Currently, the ROC
maintains observer status in the trade body.
     The 11 countries with which the ROC has completed talks under
the WTO framework include South Africa, Turkey, Malaysia, the Czech
Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, the Philippines, El Salvador, Colombia
and Uruguay as well as Australia.

Trade group arrives from mainland 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Weiling Liu

     A high-profile mainland Chinese trade delegation arrived in
Taiwan this week to meet with business leaders, tour industrial sites
and promote investment in the mainland.
     The 14-member delegation led by Guo Dongpo, chairman of the
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, was invited
for a weeklong visit by the China External Trade Development Council,
or CETRA, Taiwan's top trade promotion organization.
     Guo's position is equivalent to the rank of vice minister in the
mainland government, and the make-up of his delegation made it the
most influential to visit Taiwan since both sides began exchanges of
trade professionals last year.
     Other delegation members include Wang Wende, director of the
Office of Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau Affairs under the Ministry of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation; Zhang Yuqing, director of the
same ministry's Treaty and Law Department; and Xu Mang, director of
economic affairs of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.
     Guo said upon arrival that he hoped the trip would help to ease
tensions between Taiwan and mainland. "The main purpose of my
weeklong visit here is to call on my old friends as well as to make
new friends," he said. "I hope to meet with as many Taiwan business
and industry executives as possible to facilitate future development
of cross-Straits trade ties."
     Asked to comment on President Lee Teng-hui's recent warnings
about the risks of overreliance on trade and investments in the
mainland, Guo smiled but said nothing.
     During an Oct. 14 dinner hosted by CETRA Chairman Wang
Chang-ching, Guo said he wanted to understand Taiwan better and
intensify industrial and commercial exchanges. He said he had no
special intention to meet any high-ranking officials in the Mainland
Affairs Council, the ROC government's top agency for mainland policy.
     MAC Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian had said three days earlier
that MAC officials would not hesitate to meet with the mainland
delegation. But Kao did not attend the Oct. 14 dinner even though he
had been invited. The MAC said that pressing matters had detained Kao
and that he would attend a party for Guo toward the end of the visit.
     MAC officials also did not attend CETRA's Oct. 15 welcoming
reception for Guo's delegation. Asked at the reception whether he
would like to meet with Kao, Guo replied: "I will follow the schedule
arranged by my host." Asked whether Guo's trade promotion council
plans to set up a liaison office in Taiwan, Guo said the council has
already built up regular dialogue channels with CETRA.
     Taiwan's intermediary agency for cross-Straits talks, the
Straits Exchange Foundation, which is affiliated with the MAC, also
appeared to keep its distance from the mainland delegation. Although
Chiao Jen-ho, SEF vice chairman and secretary-general, attended the
Oct. 15 reception, he stayed only briefly.
     Analysts suggested the response by the MAC and SEF reflected the
ROC government's decision to cool down trade and investment exchanges
with the mainland. In response to such suggestions, the mainland's
Wang said that massive amounts of capital from all over the world
have been funneled into the mainland's infrastructure market and that
Taiwan risks missing out on a golden opportunity.
     The delegation on Oct. 15 toured the Taipei International
Electronics Show at the Taipei World Trade Center and the next day
visited the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, the heart of
Taiwan's computer chip industry. On Oct. 17 the delegation planned to
tour the Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corp. and call on Kao Chin-yen,
chairman of the Chinese National Federation of Industries.
     The schedule for Oct. 18 included a seminar with Taiwan business
leaders and a meeting with SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu. A meeting with
Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinese National Association of Industry
and Commerce, was planned for the following day. The delegation was
scheduled to depart Taiwan on Oct. 20.

Opposition bars premier from power plant report 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Virginia Sheng

     A test of wills between the ruling and opposition parties
unfolded this week as Premier Lien Chan was blocked from entering the
Legislature to explain why the country needs a fourth new power
plant.
     On Oct. 15, Lien made several attempts to enter the Legislature,
where he planned to appeal to restore funding for the power plant
project. But on each attempt he was blocked by a human wall of
Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers.
     "It does not make any sense," Lien said in reaction. "The
Cabinet should be respected." He also made a thumbs-down gesture to
express his disappointment.
     Government Information Office Director-General Su Chi later
quoted Lien as saying that the incident was "a dark day for
democracy" in Taiwan. "They should try to convince people with
reason, but not through force," Lien said.
     Su added that the government welcomes any reasonable discussion
of policy but not irrational behavior. He said the denial of Lien's
entry has deprived the public of its right to learn about the
controversial project.
     At the core of the conflict is the project proposed by the
state-run Taiwan Power Co., the sole power supplier on the island, to
build a new nuclear power plant in the coastal township of Kungliao
in Taipei County.
     The project was first proposed in 1980 but was shelved in 1981
because the 1979 Three-Mile Island accident in the United States
focused public attention on safety.
     Safety concerns grew in the mid-1980s, prompted in part by fears
generated by the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl plant in former
Soviet Union and in part by operational flaws at Taipower's three
existing nuclear power plants.
     The proposal for the fourth plant won a legislative nod in 1992.
Two years later lawmakers approved a budget to cover the project for
the next seven fiscal years. Each year since then opposition
lawmakers have tried to block the funding.
     In a surprise move this year, the DPP and New Party lawmakers
teamed up on May 24 to pass a resolution that scrapped the budget.
Undaunted by the setback, the Cabinet on Oct. 8 sent the power plant
project back to the Legislature for reconsideration.
     The ruling Kuomintang is expected to override the opposition's
resolution on Oct. 18, as it needs the support of only one-third of
the lawmakers present to do so. The KMT controls 83 seats in the
164-seat Legislature.
     Furthermore, Lien said, the Legislature's original approval
should stand lest the nation's major policies be subject to constant
change by the lawmaking body at the expense of responsible politics.
     Suspension of the power plant project would mean a heavy
financial loss, would inevitably hurt the ROC's credit rating and
would erect an unnecessary barrier to Taiwan's bid to join the World
Trade Organization, Lien said.
     The Legislature was originally slated to hear Lien explain why
the plant was necessary on Oct. 15, discuss the issue on Oct. 17, and
then vote on the reconsideration proposal on Oct. 18. But the row
outside the Legislature disrupted this schedule.
     The row also had political implications beyond the power plant
itself, as it reflected a looming constitutional showdown between the
executive and legislative branches over Lien's serving simultaneously
as vice president and premier.
     But the opposition tactic itself came under heavy criticism, as
some said it used the letter of the law to violate its spirit. The
blocking tactic was carried out by through provisions in the law that
permit street demonstrations.
     Some feared that the Oct. 15 confrontation would build tensions
and close off room for discussion and peaceful settlement of domestic
political differences in Taiwan.
     While the power plant issue has been debated for more than 10
years without reaching a consensus, they said, the greater damage may
be to the island's democratic spirit.
     After Lien returned to his office, the Legislature approved a
motion raised by opposition lawmakers to adjourn the session. Among
the 145 legislators present, 75 supported the motion, 68 opposed and
two abstained.
     But before opposition deputies claimed victory, Legislative
Speaker Liu Sung-pan announced that the lawmaking body would vote on
the project on Oct. 18 without further debate.
     The announcement by Liu shocked the opposition lawmakers, who
accused the speaker of repeatedly violating the neutrality of his
position.
     The opposition also pointed to legislative rules. If the Cabinet
wants to reverse a legislative decision, they said, the premier must
first report to the lawmakers on why he wants the change before a
vote is taken.
     KMT legislators countered that Lien had intended to do so but
was barred by the opposition.
     "You opposition deputies have chosen to skip the review session
by dismissing the meeting," one KMT lawmaker said. "Although the
premier could not come into the Legislature to deliver his report, he
did send in a written report."

Justices open dual-status hearing 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p2

by Virginia Sheng

     The Council of Grand Justices on Oct. 16 heard arguments on
whether it is constitutional for the vice president to serve
concurrently as premier.
     The hearing, presided over by all 16 grand justices, was
prompted by a petition from the opposition parties claiming the dual
status violates the ROC Constitution.
     President Lee Teng-hui announced in June that he had retained
Lien Chan as premier after Lee and Lien were sworn in as president
and vice president in May. Lien had submitted his resignation as
premier to Lee, not the Legislature, and in retaining Lien as premier
the president did not seek legislative approval.
     The opposition lawmakers objected and petitioned the grand
justices to rule on the issue. In the meantime, opposition lawmakers
last month prevented Lien from making his administrative report to
the Legislature. This week they barred him from explaining the
Cabinet's energy policy.
     Before the Oct. 16 hearing began, the opposition insisted that
President Lee participate. The justices decided it would be
sufficient to send Lee a letter asking his opinions on the issue.
     Because the petition concerns the Presidential Office rather
than the Cabinet, the opposition also questioned whether it was
proper for Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao to defend for the
president since he is a Cabinet official.
     Liao, for his part, asserted that the grand justices should not
be ruling on the question in the first place because the dispute is
purely political and not constitutional.
     Citing former Vice Presidents Cheng Chen and Yen Chia-kan as
precedents, Liao said that serving in two posts at the same time
causes no difficulties in practice. Chen served as premier from 1958
to 1963 and Yen from 1966 to 1972. Liao also pointed out that the
Constitution does not state an objection to a dual status such as
Lien's.
     The opposition said the two precedents took place during the
martial law period, when some provisions of the Constitution were
frozen. They said the government is responsible to establish
constitutional precedents in the time since martial law was lifted in
1987.
     The opposition also urged the grand justices to rule not on the
basis of whether the dual status is practical, but whether it is
just. It is not a matter concerning Lien's ability to serve in two
positions at the same time, they said, but whether Lee has the right
to retain Lien.
     Justice Minister Liao emphasized that the ROC government is
neither a full parliamentary system nor a full presidential system.
Thus, he said, the grand justices must take political realities into
account. He said that the duties of both positions are clearly
defined in the Constitution and that there is no problem concerning
the compatibility of Lien's dual roles.
     Hu Fo, an academic and constitutional expert representing the
opposition parties, argued that the precedents do not make a valid
case. According to the Constitution, Hu said, the vice president is a
backup for the president while the premier should be held responsible
to the Legislature.
     What matters is that in retaining Lien without legislative
approval, the president acted without any check and balance, the
opposition argued. The opposition added that, should a president be
unable to finish his term, the vice president would succeed him and
in such a case confusion would arise if the vice president and the
premier were the same person.
     Lien resigned as premier in January, as required by the
Constitution, before the newly elected Legislature convened Feb. 1.
Lee then renominated him as premier and the nomination won
legislative approval.
     Lien resigned again before he was sworn in as the vice
president. In June, Lee announced that he had retained Lien as
premier. The opposition complained loudly because Lee's choice for
premier was not submitted to the Legislature for approval.
     The nine-hour hearing before the grand justices Oct. 16 ended
without any conclusion and was scheduled to resume Nov. 1, with
arguments centered on the relationship between the president and vice
president, the president and the premier, and the original design of
the Constitution. A ruling is expected in two months.

by FCJ Editors

     A Lafayette-class missile frigate, the Hsi Ning, was
commissioned Oct. 12 at the Tsoying naval base near Kaohsiung in
southern Taiwan. The 3,600-ton frigate, the second of six ordered
from France, is armed with torpedoes, U.S.-built surface-to-air
missiles, ROC-developed Hsiungfeng II anti-ship missiles, the Phalanx
rapid-fire gun system and advanced reconnaissance equipment. The
warship's surfaces are clad in high-tech composite materials that
make it far less detectable by radar, earning it the nickname
"stealth frigate." The ROC Navy ordered the six frigates from France
in 1991 as part of a 10-year plan to modernize the fleet. The Navy
has also leased Knox-class frigates from the United States and
ordered locally built Cheng Kung-class frigates patterned after
U.S.-made Perry-class frigates.

All-party meeting sets up national conference plan 

from FREE CHINA JOURNAL, Oct 18, 1996, v13; n40; p1

by Virginia Sheng

     The consensus-building conference proposed by President Lee
Teng-hui in his inaugural address this spring has been scheduled for
five days in late December, a top presidential aide said.
     Huang Kun-huei, secretary-general to the president, said the
National Development Conference will be held Dec. 23-28 at the Taipei
International Convention Center with the aim of building a consensus
on key concerns in order to formulate and implement policies.
     These and other details were agreed on during an Oct. 11 meeting
of the conference preparatory committee. Huang is executive director
of the 29-member committee, which was established on Oct. 5 by a
Presidential Office working group.
     Lien Chan, ROC vice president and premier, is the preparatory
committee convener. Deputy conveners represent each of the three
major political parties in Taiwan.
     The deputy conveners--the Kuomintang's Vincent Siew, the
Democratic Progressive Party's Chang Chun-hung, and the New Party's
Lee Ching-hua, said the first preparatory meeting was conducted with
mutual respect and a comprehensive exchange of opinions. Huang called
the meeting "harmonious" and the discussion "heated."
     President Lee told the committee that the conference will
fulfill the pledge in his May 20 inaugural address to invite opinion
leaders and representatives from all quarters to exchange views on
matters of far-reaching importance to the Republic of China.
     "After we accomplished the direct presidential and vice
presidential election on March 23 ... national development has strode
onto a new stage," Lee told the committee. "In the new system, how to
concentrate the experience and wisdom of our people to seek long-term
prosperity for the nation is the key to whether we can launch a
wide-ranging development program and enter the next century."
     The conference agenda will fall under three major topics:
constitutional reform and party politics, economic development, and
relations between Taiwan and mainland China.
     Possible subtopics include the governmental structure, electoral
system, taxation, financial liberalization, public facility
improvement, social security programs, balancing economic development
and environmental protection, cross-Straits relations and national
security, and the parallel policies of developing Taipei-Peking ties
and carrying out pragmatic diplomacy.
     About 150 delegates, including political figures, scholars and
other opinion leaders, will be invited to the conference. Vigorous
debates are expected on such issues as the relationship between the
president, the premier and the Legislature, the abolishment of the
provincial government and the policy toward the mainland.
     The committee also decided to hold 15 forums throughout Taiwan
to gather suggestions from the general public. Forums among overseas
Chinese were rejected owing to disapproval by opposition committee
members.
     In general comments, Chang of the DPP argued that the government
should consider the conference a forum to establish national policy.
If the conference is not empowered to lead to changes, he added, then
the DPP will withdraw from it.
     The New Party's Lee characterized the conference as a forum for
negotiation or coordination between political parties. He said the
meeting in effect will serve as another advisory board to President
Lee rather than as an extraconstitutional mechanism affecting
government operations.
     While the DPP favorably recalled the National Affairs Conference
in 1990 for laying down a good foundation for subsequent
constitutional amendments, the New Party disagreed. The New Party
also insisted that four subtopics be included on December's agenda:
administrative neutrality, judicial independence, military
depoliticization and media fairness.
     Such particulars and other matters--such as whether to frame the
conference around panel discussions and whether to prepare study
papers in advance--will be taken up in future preparatory meetings.
The next is set for Oct. 22. Committee members agreed that subsequent
meetings should be attended both by party-recommended representatives
and nonpartisan experts.
     As preparatory committee convener, Lien was praised for giving
all members plenty of time to express themselves, though some said
this led to inefficiency. The meeting exceeded its original two-hour
time frame by 90 minutes.
