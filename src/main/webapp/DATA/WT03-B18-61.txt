<strong>Massimo CACCIA</strong><br>
Research Scientist</font></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Massimo Caccia received his degree in Electronic Engineering from Genoa University in 1991, with a thesis on 
Automated Planning of Autonomous Vehicle Motion. In the same year he obtained a Post-Graduate Research Grant 
from Ansaldo DNU-RTL to study sonar-based motion planning and control in wheeled land vehicles. In 1993 he 
collaborated with the Telerobot Consortium, focusing on real-time control architectures.</p>
<p>&#160;In May 1993 he joined the Istituto Automazione Navale (IAN) of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche in Genoa as a 
Research Scientist. His research at IAN has encompassed numerous subjects, notably: intelligent control and software 
architectures for underwater vehicles; sensor-based navigation (acoustic motion estimation and world modelling); 
guidance and control of UUVs; UUV simulation and identification; in-water testing.</p>
<p>&#160;He has devoted particular attention to the following areas:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Study of intelligent control architectures for complex robotic systems; design of the control and 
software architectures for IAN&#146;s prototype underwater vehicles Roby and Romeo;</li>
<li>Development of a dynamic simulator for underwater vehicles based on a simple uncoupled 
model and on PECE numeric integration methods</li>
<li>In-water testing of the vehicle Roby and identification of its heading and depth sensors, its 
hydrodynamic coefficients and the parameters of its propellers; identification of the parameters 
of ROMEO&#146;s propellers;</li>
<li>Construction of an autopilot based on PID techniques for the vehicle Roby; development of a 
regulator for heading control in underwater vehicles based on fuzzy logic methods;</li>
<li>Sonar-based reconstruction of a 2-D map of a structured environment in the case of known 
sensor position; integration of these mapping methods with acoustic localization methods 
developed at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey;</li>
<li>Joint study with the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey for sonar-based estimation of the 
World Model of an underwater vehicle and sonar-based estimation of underwater vehicle 
motion relative to a scanned surface</li>
<li>Joint study with the Instituto de Sistemas e Robotica in Lisbon for the definition of an interface 
between Roby&#146;s control software and the mission manager based on Petri Nets in use at the 
Portuguese centre.</li>
</ul>
