<B>Hodgson Expands Sport Fishing Opportunities
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson today announced that the ministry is taking action to increase recreational fishing opportunities for lake trout across south-central Ontario.<P>

Based on recommendations from the new Fish & Wildlife Advisory Board, Mr. Hodgson said that effective January l, l997, 48 lakes will be open to lake trout fishing with:<P>
<UL>
<LI>no slot limits,
<LI>a daily catch limit of two fish,
<LI>two lines allowed for ice fishing, 
<LI>permission to use live bait.
</UL>
On six additional lakes stocked by MNR as 'put, grow and take' lakes, fishing seasons will be expanded to open January l. (See <A HREF="lake.html">lake lists</A> for details.)<P> 

"As a result of requests by the public, I asked the Fish and Wildlife Advisory Board to consider options which would benefit the lake trout fishery and increase recreational fishing opportunities," Mr. Hodgson said.  "The board worked closely with MNR staff to build on the lake trout strategy we had developed earlier."<P>

The Minister also announced that MNR will be initiating lake surveys in l997 and l998 on each of the 48 lakes to determine the best future management strategy. These surveys will be funded from Ontario fishing and hunting licence revenues. New ministry legislation has made it possible for these revenues to be used directly to benefit fish and wildlife programs.<P>

"In response to the Minister's request, we conducted an extensive review with the angling public, fishery biologists with the Ontario Federation of Anglers & Hunters, and MNR fish management staff," Fish and Wildlife Advisory Board Chairman Phil Morlock said. "Our recommendations are built on the foundation that conservation of the resource is the first priority, which is the message we also received from the angling public across central Ontario."<P>

The Minister has asked MNR staff to continue to work closely with the board and local committees to streamline lake trout regulations and to explore other management options that can continue to improve the quality of fishing in the region.<P>
