AUSTRALIA: CSIRO TO LOSE NEW CHIEF - MCINTOSH TO HEAD DEFENCE DEPT

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

CSIRO will soon be seeking a new Chief Executive as a
result of Federal Government moves to switch the
incumbent, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, to the top job in the
Defence Department.

No formal announcement of the change is expected in the
near future, but informed sources in Canberra have
assured Scitech the move is definitely 'on', providing his
on-going battle with illness does not become a major
problem.

Any such transfer would make good administrative sense
in the light of Dr McIntosh's outstanding defence-oriented
professional background and would be likely to be welcomed
by the armed services. It would certainly be welcomed by
our military allies in Britain and the United States.

It would also be seen as a clear promotion for Dr McIntosh
- from running CSIRO and answering to a junior Minister
(Mr Peter McGauran) to supervising a $10 billion Defence
operation which has a Minister (Mr Ian McLachlan) inside
the Howard Cabinet.

The sources said Dr McIntosh, whose start at CSIRO
coincidentally occurred as the Coalition Government took
office, had been disappointed with the comparatively
junior status given to science by the new administration.
His feelings had not been dispelled by the Federal Budget's
bogus 'increase' in CSIRO funding (Scitech, Vol 16, No 9),
they said.

Dr McIntosh was recently announced as the head of a
special committee appointed to conduct a thorough review
of the Defence Department. It is expected that this role
will be used as the lever to subsequently appoint him as
head of the Defence Department, thereby utilising the
specific knowledge he would have gained through the
inquiry to significantly improve its vast and complex
administration.

(The review coincides with separate plans to revamp the
operational capabilities of the Army, including the transfer
of 1000 non-combat personnel to combat units).

He is expected to officially remain as chief of the CSIRO at
least until the Defence inquiry is completed. (The current
target date for the review report - and an implementation
plan - is March 10 next year).

The Government is placing great store in the results of the
inquiry, having indicated it wants to find annual efficiency
savings worth around $500 million from the Defence
operating budget. Ironically, the Government had
announced at the time of the Federal Budget that Defence
was the only portfolio which would not face some level of
funding cuts.

Mr McLachlan said the review was intended to "examine
specific management activities in Defence with a view to
eliminating needless duplication, making appropriate use
of commercialisation options, and reflect, where
appropriate, modern business practices".

He said about $5 billion of the Department's annual budget
was spent on areas other than designated combat forces
and related equipment. The emphasis of the review would
be "efficiency gains" in these areas, ranging from logistical
support "down to postage stamps and stationery".

The review committee will include: Vice Admiral Robert
Walls, Vice Chief of the Australian Defence Force; Dr
Richard Brabin Smith, Chief Defence Scientist; Mr Ian
Burgess, Chairman of AMP; Mr John Stone, former
Secretary of the Treasury; and Mr Andrew Michaelmore,
Executive General Manager, Business Development,
Planning and Technology, of Western Mining Corporation.

Dr McIntosh, 53, graduated in science (honours) from the
ANU and later obtained a PhD in physics there. His
working career started with the Weapons Research
Establishment, at Salisbury, South Australia. After serving
two years' national service (having attained the rank of
Major) he became a lecturer in mathematics and computer
science at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology
(RMIT).

He joined the Defence Department in 1974 and after a
series of promotions through the Australian Public Service
became Chief of Capital Procurement in the Defence
Department in 1988, then Secretary of the Department of
Industry, Technology and Commerce in 1990.

During 1991 he became the UK's Chief of Defence
Procurement, responsible for spending $20 billion a year,
and played a major part in introducing the latest Trident
missiles to Britain's armed services. His work there was
highly praised and led to a knighthood, personally
bestowed earlier this year by the Queen. (He uses the title
only in Britain). The US Government also gave him its
highest possible civilian defence honour for foreigners, the
Medal for Distinguished Public Service, (Scitech, Vol 16, No
7) for his work in coordinating and strengthening the
defence efforts of Britain and America.

Dr McIntosh returned to Australia to takeup his
appointment as Chief Executive of the CSIRO. A Fellow of
the Royal Aeronautical Society, UK, his list of achievements
includes numerous prizes in fields including military arts
and accountancy.

Clearly, his background indicates his level of professional
interest in all areas of Defence and his level of
achievement in Australia and overseas is such that he is
eminently qualified for the post of Secretary of the
Defence Department.

It is understood that the Government has not yet
considered his replacement at CSIRO.

AUSTRALIA: SENATE QUESTIONS ON SCITECH STORY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Last month's Scitech front page story (Natural Heritage
Trust a fraud) led to questions being asked of the
Government in the Senate.

The Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator
Meg Lees, sought responses to a number of matters raised
in Scitech from the Leader of the Government, Senator
Robert Hill (see next story for full transcript).

These included statements from Scitech's source - a senior
Coalition advisor - that the trust is "a cynical political
invention and a blackmail device" and that it "is a gigantic
and disgusting sham".

Senator Lees also raised the comments of the source that
the Trust concept had been "a blatant blackmail device
created by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr
Andrew Robb; that the plan had been imposed upon
Senator Rod Kemp (the former shadow Minister for
Environment); and is now being imposed upon you
(Senator Hill)"

Other questions related to the claim by our source that
"senior Coalition MPs openly joked behind closed doors
about the policy" and that "the deceit had sickened this
particular advisor and a number of other Coalition staffers
who are genuinely concerned about the national environment
for the sake of their children and for the nation's
long-term future".

Senator Hill made no attempt to answer any of the specific
allegations, not even the suggestion that he had been
`saddled' with the Trust policy. He simply twice made brief
comments outlining the Government's usual claims about
the need for the partial privatisation of Telstra if money
was to be made available to start to rectify the continent's
many serious environmental problems - land degradation,
soil salinity, and rising water tables.

Other Government Senators sat silent throughout the
questions and the answers. Not one attempted to rebut the
allegations even by way of an interjection.

Senator Lees later issued a press release, again referring
to the Scitech front page article, in which she said the
advisor's admission had confirmed every criticism of the
Trust concept which had come from the Australian
Democrats.

Senator Hill issued no press release on the allegations and
has apparently made no public comment on the matter.

Despite the Government's public silence it started a major
internal search for the source of our story, with a number
of people being wrongly accused by Coalition Ministers,
MPs, Senators, and staffers alike.

Scitech even received a call from a long-time Liberal Party
acquaintance (an advisor in a very high office) willing to
volunteer `nominees' while trying unsuccessfully to learn
the identify of the source. Again, there was absolutely no
questioning of the accuracy of the story.

During the subsequent debate on the Telstra (Dilution of
Public Ownership) Bill, some days later, Senator Lees again
repeated many of the claims published in Scitech,. Yet
again, there was no denial of the details from the
Government.

AUSTRALIA: TRUST QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The official Hansard record (see story above) is as follows:

Senator Lees: My question is to the Minister for the
Environment. What is your reaction to the following two
direct quotes from a magazine published today? The first
one is: The linkage to the environment is just a sop,
designed to cloud the Telstra sale issue and to try to
blackmail other parties and the general community into
accepting it. The second one is: A lot of the opponents of
the Telstra sale have long suggested the Natural Heritage
Trust was a cynical political invention and a blackmail
device. Some have also suggested it was a creation of Mr
Robb. They have always been correct on both counts,
despite the Government's continuing denials. It is time the
community was told the truth - the Natural Heritage Trust
is a gigantic and disgusting sham.

Senator Hill: I suppose we will learn in the supplementary
question the source of the quote. The answer of course is
that this Government is intent on reinvesting a large sum
of money in the natural capital of Australia. The time for
that is overdue. Through ignorance, in particular, we as a
nation have done enormous damage to our natural
environment. We have failed to appreciate how fragile it
is. We adopted European farming practices, for example,
without understanding fully how they would affect our
streams and our soils. As a result of that, there is now
very severe degradation, salinity, and rising water tables -
a lot of major damage that is going to take a very large
sum of money to remedy.

The Government, of course, needs to obtain that sum of
money. There are only two real sources. For the former
Government, it would have been to borrow more. They
borrowed literally billions more than they raised. I guess
you borrow or you tax more, or you sell an asset and
reinvest part of the capital proceeds of that asset in this
particular task. That is what we have chosen to do - a very
legitimate policy decision to sell one-third of Telstra, a
telecommunications company, and to reinvest $1 billion of
the proceeds of that sale in our natural environment. I
personally do not see any sham in that. It seems to me to
be a sound policy, sensibly based and something that is -
certainly, the need to remedy, the need to reinvest the
capital - strongly supported by the majority of
Australians.

What is interesting is that, as the debate develops, even
the funding source of it is becoming supported by many,
many more Australians. I hope that in the next few weeks
the Senate will see fit to support the Government on its
piece of legislation to provide that capital fund, and that
we can then go about doing something really worthwhile
for the natural environment that previous Governments
have not been prepared or able to do.

Senator Lees: I thank the Minister for his answer, but
what we are looking for is a decisive commitment. If I can
just advise you that the magazine I quoted from is Scitech
magazine, published today, and the quote has actually
come from a senior Coalition advisor.

What is your reaction to his revelations - again, I am
using his words - that the Telstra link is a gigantic and
disgusting sham; that it's a blatant blackmail device
created by the Federal Director of the Liberal Party,
Andrew Robb; that the plan was imposed upon Rod Kemp
and now is being imposed on you; that senior Coalition
MPs openly joked behind closed doors about the policy;
and that the deceit had sickened this particular advisor
and a number of other Coalition staffers who are
genuinely concerned about the national environment for
the sake of their children and the nation's long-term
future? This is really a question about the seriousness of
this Government's failure to do something about the
problem.

Senator Hill: The Honourable Senator gives me one more
minute to urge upon her to take an action that will really
benefit the Australian environment and therefore accord
with the wishes of the Australian people; that is, support
the sale of one-third of Telstra and help set-up this $1
billion fund to reinvest in the natural capital of Australia.

Yes, Senator, we will continue to support the environment
through recurrent expenditure, but what is now needed is
more - what is now needed is the reinvestment of a very
large capital sum. If you work together with us, if we put
that $1 billion in place, we earn income on that $1 billion,
and we add that to our normal recurrent expenditure, we
could provide an annual appropriation over the next five
years of very substantial sums of money that could make
a difference to vegetation, to streams and waterways, to
the national reserve system, to coasts and seas, and that
would be something very worthwhile for you to do.

AUSTRALIA: A MESSAGE FROM THE PUBLISHER

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Thank you to all our subscribers who responded to the
survey published in our August edition. We were well
pleased with the response rate and the level of positive
feedback.

There was a very strong indication of the types of
information you want from Scitech and over the coming
months we will be increasing our coverage of these
important areas at the expense of those you told us were
less popular.

The most frequent negative comment, from a minority of
respondents, was that Scitech is taking a political stance.
We have no preference for any political party and we
believe it is our responsibility to report on the activities of
whatever government is in power, the reactions of the
community we serve to these activities (especially where
these are against the message that the government is
seeking to portray) and to make informed analysis and
comment. However we will in future clearly distinguish
comment from reporting by introducing an editorial
column (see back page), which a majority of respondents
indicated would be of interest to them.

There was also some interest in an annual index. To
accommodate the needs of people who wish to reference
articles in Scitech we have decided to make the entire
contents of the 1996 editions available on disc in ascii text
so they can be searched using any text retrieval software.

The price of this is $100 for customers who subscribed
prior to January 1996 and $350 for non-subscribers (a
discount is available for those who started their
subsciption in 1996). Please contact Michaela Baer at our
office for details.

AUSTRALIA: DEPUTY PM PLEDGES SUPPORT TO SCIENCE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tim Fischer, has pledged
that the Howard Government will give continuing support
to science and technology - and its Labor predecessor's
ambition of establishing Australia as "the clever country".

His remarks came during a speech to the Australian
Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering
(AATSE) last month on the topic: Science and Technology -
A Vital Part of the APEC Agenda.

"The Australian Government is working to ensure that
developments in science, technology and engineering are
serving the interest we, and all nations, have in improved
standards of living. And we are pursuing, through
international organisations, the strengthening of a world-
wide intellectual property regime", Mr Fischer said.

"Science and technology are integral to discussions about
improving economic performance and strengthening
economic cooperation. One of this century's major lessons
is that the economic performance of a nation cannot be
isolated from its performance in science and technology, or
its investment in R&D. The fact is that science and
technology are vitally important to good economic
performance.

"Since the turn of the century, per capita incomes in the
OECD nations have increased sixfold in real terms. Most of
this increase comes as a result of increased productivity
and this, in turn, is usually generated by increases in
knowledge and technical advancements. And, of course,
increased knowledge and technical advancements are
driven by developments in science, technology and
engineering - the link is clear and well understood", he
said.

Mr Fischer said the Coalition recognised the importance of
international transfers of knowledge and technology to the
competitiveness of local industry. This was essential
because the majority of the world's breakthroughs in R&D
occurred in only five countries - the US, the UK, Japan,
Germany and France. Smaller countries, including
Australia, made valuable contributions to scientific
knowledge, often in specialised fields. Australia had
specialised advantages in several areas - natural resource
science, agricultural technology, geoscience, and ecology.

"The Coalition Government fully understands that science,
technology and engineering are central to advances in
productivity and new product development. Science and
technology underpins Australia's economic future in an
increasingly competitive world.

"The Government is committed to making the most. of
Australia's undoubted excellence in key areas of science,
technology and engineering R&D. We are also committed to
encouraging free and fair international access to scientific
and technological developments. Australia's reputation as
an innovator is well deserved - and it is due to the efforts
of those here, and all your colleagues, that we can be
proud to call Australia a clever country", the Deputy PM
said.

The Federal Government's $2 million Science and
Technology Awareness Program appears to have a bright
future, at least in the short-term.

This follows the decision of the Minister for Science and
Technology, Mr Peter McGauran, to take effective personal
control of the scheme. Informed sources in Canberra
suggest there are two elements to that decision: it will
help to promote community awareness of the benefits of
science and technology expenditure and it is a good way
for the Minister to raise his current level of media
exposure.

Meanwhile, officials responsible for the day to day
administration of the scheme have called for applications
for grants in 1997. They said: "We are looking for fresh,
new ideas to raise the profile of science, engineering and
technology, to change the way Australians thinks about
these vital areas of endeavour - and to capture the
interest of young Australians".

Information/application kits are available through the
Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, Canberra.
Tel: 06 276 1714. Fax: 06 276 2002. Applications close on
December 23.

Editor's note: Mr McGauran is extremely ambitious,
regarding himself as a good chance to ultimately become
Leader of the National Party. He has quickly established a
reputation in relevant circles as an extremely energetic -
and approachable Minister. But he is also known to be
somewhat frustrated by his present junior status in the
Howard Ministry.

The science awareness program provides an excellent
vehicle for the Minister to promote himself to the
community and to the media. It allows him to choose from
a long list of "goods news" items (research projects and
scientific breakthroughs) which are of widespread interest
and which are unlikely to attract the cynical response
which many other political activities can engender.

AUSTRALIA: CHIEF SCIENTIST: FASTS CONCERN

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Coalition Government's plans to permanently change
the role of Chief Scientist to a part-time appointment (now
rumoured to be one day a week!) has raised concerns
within the science community.

The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological
Societies (FASTS), which represents a total membership of
40,000 across both fields, has publicly questioned the
move.

The President of FASTS, Dr Joe Baker, has admitted there
could be some benefits to the concept of appointing a
scientist who is still actively working beside research
colleagues in the field for much of the time. He said this
would maintain real links with the science community and
help to avoid the new Chief Scientist from becoming
bogged-down within the structure of the bureaucracy.

But there are many minuses involved in the idea, Dr Baker
said. The most obvious was the logistical impossibility of a
one-day a week Chief Scientist effectively keeping abreast
of all relevant developments across "the sprawling world
of Australian science in sufficient detail to offer credible
advice to the Government".

The issue is to be discussed at the FASTS Council meeting
later this month. The Minister for Science and Technology,
Mr Peter McGauran, will attend a session of the Council
and Dr Baker has indicated the Minister will be questioned
on the matter.

No date for an announcement of the new Chief Scientist
has yet been determined but Canberra sources believe it is
imminent.

AUSTRALIA: SCIENCE FUNDING AND CSIRO 'SAFE'

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Science funding - and the existence and operations of the
CSIRO - are likely to be maintained in coming years,
according to the CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm
McIntosh.

He also predicted a continuation of Government-sponsored
schemes to help promote industry R&D and an
evolutionary change in the existing structure of
Government (State and Federal) research activities.

These ideas emerged when Dr McIntosh gave the Brodie-Hall
Address in Perth last month.

He said: "The first prediction I'll make is that Governments
in Australia, particularly Federal Governments, but I think
probably also State Governments, will continue to support
science strongly. Now you might think that's a pretty rash
sort of a prediction to be making, but if you look back over
the past few years, by and large, State and Federal
Governments have given science a fairly prominent place.
And in the last (Federal) Budget, when this was a
reforming conservative Government dedicated to massive
slashes in outlays, science was one of the few areas to
survive relatively intact.

"The university system as a whole was cut, but science in
universities was preferentially protected - not completely,
but preferentially. The amount of money put through the
research grants process for universities was increased for
science infrastructure.

"CSIRO was sustained at about the same level of funding -
there were some interesting ups and downs (Scitech, Vol
16, No 9) but it survived with about the same money and
has an opportunity to increase its funding in some
interesting constructive ways.

"Now all of this happened at a time when the Government
was taking $4 billion off in the first year and another $4
billion in the second. That says that somebody in the
Government at least felt science was worth funding and I
think it will persist into the next century," Dr McIntosh
said.

"The second thing I will predict is that the structures will
change, however slowly. State Governments are getting
out of extension services and by and large they are
changing the structures. We, among others, are finding
ourselves in the position of being heavily pressed for
mergers, take-overs, joint-ventures and other mechanisms
that would have the effect of progressively, over time,
changing the research structures in Australia.

He said: "There is a serious set of discussions going on in
that way with a number of the States, and I would guess
that in due course this will go for the Federal agencies as
well.

"The third prediction I would make is that we are by no
means at the end of the schemes designed to encourage
R&D. I think the tax schemes are dead because of the
recent history regardless of whether that is a good or a
bad thing. I believe it will become clear that the other
schemes are not necessarily doing all the things that were
done before and it will probably take two or three rounds
before we have schemes which by popular acclaim are
likely to generate the sorts of internationally-competitive
R&D that we need. So I suspect that is not too stable.

"If all of that happens - and I say that is what I believe is
most likely - then I think we are likely to have quite a
positive environment for R&D in Australia," Dr McIntosh
said.

"The final comment, or prediction if you like, is that CSIRO
will continue in much of its present form. Now that's a
pretty rash prediction indeed. There are two ways that
could be untrue. Firstly, the Government could do to CSIRO
what New Zealand did to its equivalent body (DSIR) -
break it up into little pieces that mirror major activities
and then flog them off or privatise them, or whatever.

"I don't see any evidence of that happening at the
moment, and as long as CSIRO is actually contributing
through large multi-disciplinary sorts of activities, I think
there is a compelling case not to do so. We now have this
almost unique institution, only the French have anything
like it. We have this almost unique capability in the world
to tackle large problems and I think we'll keep it.

"The other thing that could be seriously threatening to the
existence of an organisation like CSIRO is not so much that
we would break it up or change it internally, but that we
would actually starve it to death. Again, I see very little
likelihood of that happening," he said.

AUSTRALIA: UNION'S POST-BUDGET FEARS EASING

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Assurances from the Howard Government and CSIRO
senior management have partly allayed fears within the
CSIRO staff union that widespread sackings and asset sales
would follow this year's Budget allocations.

The Secretary of the CSIRO Division of the Community
Public Sector Union, Mr Peter O'Donoghue, told Scitech he
was "never 100 percent certain" that CSIRO would manage
the loan of $60 million in a way that would not adversely
impact of its staff. Now he feels less concerned about the
immediate future of his members than he did at the time
of the Budget announcement.

He had been pessimistic about the likely impact of the
Budget because of the Government's announcement that it
was increasing funding when it was actually taking back
the 'extra' money (Scitech, Vol 16, No 9).

"I was fearful that the organisation might spend the so-
called extra money without making adequate provision for
repaying it down the track. If that happened I could not
see that asset sales would recoup the money and I feared
there would have to be widespread sackings as a result,"
Mr O'Donoghue said.

"Since that time I have had discussions with the CSIRO
Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh. Following those
talks I feel less apprehensive than before, but we always
have to remain wary to protect the interests of our
members.

"Apart from our concerns about the Budget arrangements,
we have been anxious for our members and jobs due to
proposals by the Government to considerably reduce
CSIRO's cash reserves. In the meeting with Dr McIntosh he
said discussions with the Government on this matter had
been positive but a final decision had not yet been
reached.

"The union is seeking a meeting with the Minister for
Science and Technology, Mr Peter McGauran, in order to
obtain assurances on this." Mr O'Donoghue said.

Environment monitoring technology developed by CSIRO is
to be used extensively by a major consultant company
working throughout Indonesia.

The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John
Moore, announced the sale and hailed it as a possible
precursor to worldwide adoption of the Australian system.
Licensing of the technology for CSIRO is being handled by
a Queensland firm, Comserve Australia Pty Ltd. It has
signed a joint marketing agreement for Indonesia with a
the Jakarta-based PT Ramatelino Perdana Consultant. The
Minister said the deal was a first for CSIRO and for private
sector organisations in Australia and Indonesia. He said
the leading-edge technology would assist authorities in
Indonesia to properly plan strategies for land-use, water
storage, and population management.

AUSTRALIA: ENVIRONMENT'S NEW NAME

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Five major groupings within the Department of
Environment, Sport and Territories are to be identified in
future as Environment Australia.

The Minister for Environment, Senator Robert Hill, said he
regarded the new name as an important symbolic change.
He said: "It recognises that environment functions have
reached a point in their history where a new approach is
needed to achieve the aims of the Government."

The departmental groups to be combined within
Environment Australia are:

* Australian and World Heritage Group (combining the
functions of national and international heritage).

* Environment Protection Group (consolidating existing
environment protection functions with additional
responsibilities, such as climate change and Greenhouse
activities).

* Biodiversity Group (combines several major components
including biodiversity conservation, sustainable land and
water use, and reserve and wildlife management).

* Portfolio Marine Group (to reflect the Government's
priorities in this area, coordinate coasts and clean seas
programs, and develop an overall marine policy for the
Commonwealth).

* Environment Priorities and Coordination Group (will
support the Environment Executive on international,
economic and environment information matters, and will
manage major cross-portfolio activities).

Senator Hill said the restructure would not impact on the
statutory functions and independence of statutory advice
from the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service
(ANPWS) or the Australian Heritage Commission (AHC). He
said policy work will be focussed in the Department with
the authorities concentrating on their statutory wildlife,
parks and heritage protection responsibilities.

The new structure will become fully operational later this
year, following the development of sectional structures for
each functional group. This process would involve
consultation with staff, he said.

The Minister has also announced the names of the Senior
Executives of four of the five groupings. They are: Ms
Sharon Sullivan (Australian and World Heritage Group); Dr
Peter Bridgewater (Biodiversity Group - and Director
ANPWS); Environment Priorities and Coordination Group,
Mr Phillip Toyne; and Dr Ian McPhail (Portfolio Marine
Group - and Chairman, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
Authority). He said the head of the Environment
Protection Group would be announced in the near future.

AUSTRALIA: INSECT SUSPECTS IN VIRUS ESCAPE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Research into the unauthorised spread of rabbit calicivirus
from its island testing site off South Australia in October
last year has reinforced suspicions that insects were
responsible.

A range of genetic tests undertaken at the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory have found that a range of
insects, including bushflies, blowflies, and mosquitos, are
capable of carrying the virus.

Molecular tests on 16 separate groups of insects captured
in areas where the disease had become established found
that 13 groups carried some evidence of the virus and one
carried live calicivirus.

The CSIRO was seriously embarrassed by the 'escape' of
the virus while it was allegedly undergoing intensive
testing to ensure it would not harm humans, livestock, or
native fauna.

Although not yet conclusive, scientists regard the tests as
a good indication that the rapid spread of the virus from
Wardang Island to all mainland States and Territories had
been essentially caused by insects. (There are some
theories that outbreaks of the virus in isolated rural
districts in NSW were the result of anxious farmers
trading in the carcasses of diseased rabbits to overcome
delays in the official approval for its release).

Meanwhile, the Minister for Primary Industries and
Energy, Mr John Anderson, has officially approved the
release of the disease at 280 locations throughout
Australia (NSW, 50 sites; Queensland, 50; South Australia,
50; Victoria, 50; WA, 40; NT, 30; ACT, 5; and Tasmania, 5).

Officials in Tasmania have refused to participate in the
program - at this stage - pending the results of further
testing on its wildlife species because of fears the virus
could produce unexpected results.

Farmers and wildlife officers working in regions where the
virus has now been established for up to 12 months have
reported a staggering reduction in rabbit numbers and the
relatively fast re-establishment of many native shrubs,
trees, and grasses - some of which had not been commonly
seen for many years.

The release program is seen as a major boost to the
national environment by cutting rabbit numbers, thereby
reducing erosion and related problems caused by over-
grazing and the spread of underground warrens. Similarly,
native animals will face less competition for food and
shelter, and farmers will have more grazing capacity for
their livestock.

It has been officially estimated that direct environmental
damage and lost farm production due to rabbits (pre-virus)
totals in excess of $650 million a year.

Opinions are divided about the effects of the anti-rabbit
scheme on populations of feral animals, such as foxes and
cats. Some experts feel their numbers may be reduced by
the reduction in rabbits as a food source but others
believe this will lead to an increase in feral animals
hunting small native species.

This news has emerged in the midst of sweeping Howard
Government changes to the structure of Federal agencies

The Minister for Environment, Senator Hill, publicly
announced Mr Carbon's departure from the bureaucracy
while revealing the latest restructure details. He simply
said: "Mr Barry Carbon, Executive Director of the former
Environment Protection Agency will be retiring from the
Australian Public Service. Mr Carbon has made a

as Executive Director".

The departure of Mr Carbon from the bureaucracy has

"The auditor will review documentation relied on in
preparing the EIS, and will report on the technical
adequacy of the EIS. The auditor's role will require some
degree of public interaction and this will happen where
appropriate. The auditor's report on the draft EIS will be

AUSTRALIA: TECHNOLOGY TO SAVE "OLD" FORESTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A new high-tech solution to identifying tracts of old
growth trees within logged forests is under development
by CSIRO, State Forests (NSW), and the timber industry.

The airborne unit uses digital cameras to record infra-red
light emitted from forest areas and this data can later be
processed by computer into colour-coded maps of the area
surveyed. Fast-growing trees (new growth) show up as
red and slow-growing (old growth) are shown as green or
blue.

A major cause of dissension between pro-logging and anti-
logging groups is the argument that old-growth forests
require special protection for the sake of biodiversity,
providing sanctuary for endangered native species, and
maintaining areas of `pristine forest' for future
generations.

The system is currently undergoing field tests in forests
surrounding Bateman's Bay on the NSW South Coast.

AUSTRALIA: R&D WILL STOP - OR GO OFFSHORE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government's numerous changes to the R&D
tax concession and its eligibility criteria will have a serious
negative effect on Australian industry, according to two
major independent surveys of business intentions.

Both found that a large proportion of respondent
companies had indicated that the reduction from 150
percent to 125 percent in the tax concession rate would
make the majority of companies reconsider plans for
future R&D projects. Many firms expressed concern that
the reduced concession, combined with a significant
increase in related compliance costs, would adversely
affect the economics of undertaking the work in Australia.

Some would seek to take advantage of the more-generous
range of concessions available in countries such as
Singapore and Malaysia, while others would simply seek
to import technology already developed overseas.

The studies were undertaken by Price Waterhouse
Technology, through the Australian Industry Research
Group, and by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

The Price Waterhouse survey was sent to 250 strategically
selected companies which were likely to be affected by
the range of Budget changes to the R&D concessions. These
covered such industry sectors as mining and resources,
high technology, telecommunications, building, food,
chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and manufacturing. Responses
were received from a number of leading Australian
companies as well as many SMEs.

The executive summary of the survey found:

* Two-thirds of respondents said the (former) concession
had been a major factor in their investment in R&D.

* Following the changes (lower benefit, higher compliance
costs) more than half would reduce their R&D effort by 20
percent or more, or switch to offshore R&D, or
subcontracting.

* More than 65 percent of respondents say they will need
to change or improve their systems to take advantage of
the new concessions within the new six-month lodgement
deadline.

* Overall, the cost of compliance as a percentage of the
available tax benefits, is expected to rise by 114 percent.

* At the same time the level of R&D benefits will fall by an
average of 45 percent.

* Almost half of the respondents had serious concerns
about the level of service provided by AusIndustry.

* The results suggest that R&D in Australia may again
"decline to the inadequate levels of the early 1980s,
indicating a clear need for a reconsideration of
Government policy in this area".

The second study involved 125 responses to surveys sent
by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to 395 large to medium
companies across Australia.

It found:

* 40 percent of respondents believed the concession
changes would have a negative impact on their future R&D
activities.

* 56.8 percent of companies currently claiming the
concessions would think again concerning future R&D
because of the reduced concessions.

* 24 percent of respondents said they would now seriously
consider moving their R&D offshore to locations such as
Singapore and Malaysia. (It described this as "the most
concerning implication of the survey" because only 46.4
percent of respondents had been aware of the R&D
concession schemes in Malaysia and Singapore. The
number of companies aware of the offshore possibilities
was steadily increasing as a result of the controversy
surrounding the Budget changes and this appeared likely
to ultimately increase the number of Australian companies
which would seek to relocate their R&D efforts overseas).

* 34.1 percent of companies which had claimed local R&D
benefits over the past five years would now consider
moving those operations offshore.

* 29 percent of respondents said they would continue to
undertake local R&D but would no longer find it
worthwhile to claim the reduced concessions because of
the effects of the higher compliance costs and the reduced
benefits available.

The survey states: "There is no question that reducing the
concessional rate of the R&D concession to 125 percent will
have an immeasurably detrimental impact upon the
amount of R&D being carried out by Australian companies.
It is certain that the reduction in the amount of R&D
conducted in Australia could lead both to an increase in
unemployment and a decrease in taxation revenue
collected by the Government, Further, the reduction will
affect both the amount of the Government's taxation
revenue and the Australian economy on many other
levels.

"The most obvious and detrimental of these will be the
steady movement of corporate R&D operations offshore,
particularly in high technology growth industries. It will
inhibit growth in Australian business and render the
'clever country' significantly less progressive and
technologically second-rate. Further, the reduction in the
concessional rate will encourage more companies to
purchase technology from foreign countries, sending more
and more potentially taxable Australian dollars and capital
offshore. The effects of this sort of flow will have serious
and potentially irreversible consequences for the
Australian economy.

"The reduction in the concession rate is actively dissuading
Australian companies from undertaking R&D activities. In
doing so the Government is sending a clear message to
companies that, despite its rhetoric, the Government is not
willing to properly support R&D activities conducted in
this country. The proposed 125 percent R&D tax
concession cannot compete with other OECD countries
despite the Budget's claims to the contrary. This simple
fact will ensure irreversible damage to Australia's future
whilst assisting our neighbour countries in their economic
and technological growth".

AUSTRALIA: CSIRO CHIEF ENDORSES CUTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The general thrust of the Howard Government's cuts to
R&D tax concessions have been supported by the CSIRO
Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh. This emerged
during a major speech in Perth in which he expressed
confidence in the future funding of science and the CSIRO.

Dr McIntosh said some Budget measures (such as the
abolition of R&D syndication) had been necessary because
of their very high cost to overall revenue.

He said: "It's a fascinating reflection that when the
Government abolished the syndication R&D tax scheme
and lowered the level of assistance through the ordinary
tax scheme from 150 percent to 125 percent, one of the
fundamental issues was whether 125 percent was enough
to retain the serious R&D in Australia.

"Another was whether we would now be out-competed,
particularly by the Asian enthusiasts for R&D, even of
Australian firms. The judgement was made by the
Government that 125 percent was sufficient.

"The case of syndicated R&D was a more complex set of
discussions. The overwhelming impression, as the
Treasurer so colourfully put it, was that the taxation
syndication system had been heavily rorted. Heavily
rorted is not a term that a taxation syndicate R&D user
like CSIRO would use; it's not something you would say
about your customers, "Dr McIntosh said.

"But clearly it was, at the very least, an economically
inefficient scheme - I mean that in the sense that the
amount of tax revenue forgone to generate a given amount
of R&D was very high. There is no doubt the tax
syndication scheme did generate extra R&D (CSIRO was a
positive beneficiary of that), but it was also true that it
cost an awful lot of forgone revenue.

"My own memory is that when the scheme was first
introduced I met a senior businessman in Australia at the
time and I said the scheme would lead to a major increase
in R&D in companies. He replied that there would actually
be a major increase in accounting activities to redefine all
operations that could possibly be deemed to be eligible to
obtain the benefits which would flow from such actions -
and that is what happened.

"There was an apparent major surge in R&D with no extra
R&D being done, at least initially. Over time that changed
quite significantly and we reached the point where the
most difficult decision was how to change the scheme
without throwing the baby out with the bath water. What
the Government decided to do was create a scheme which
was no longer tax-based but which retained most of the
ingredients of the syndication R&D scheme," he said.

Dr McIntosh said the importance of the syndication
scheme was that it had attracted a number of major
players into the area of R&D, including a finance house
which had learned that the risks in such investments
(with the taxation benefits) were commensurate with
those in housing, construction or the stock market. It had
also attracted major overseas players who could supply
enabling technology to help local firms leapfrog over
existing technology and develop worthwhile new ideas.
The scheme had also involved local companies which
intended to exploit the products and processes developed
under the scheme and a local "do-er", such as CSIRO, which
would undertake the actual R&D.

"It was, in many cases, the combining of those players that
was more important than the mere fact that the R&D was
being subsidised in some way.

"What we and others are now trying to do is to convince
the Government that the new Start program needs to have
the combination of characteristics needed to attract the
same group of players, rather than providing a single
grant which would attract the Australian player alone, but
which would not attract the enabling technology and
which would be most unlikely to attract the financial
institution. We really need a mechanism out of the grant,
loan, and interest rate subsidy scheme which puts all that
back together," Dr McIntosh said.

He predicted that no administration would be likely to
return to a tax-based R&D scheme "for another generation"
because of the Government's complaints that the
syndication scheme had been "rorted so heavily".

"Those of you who remember the Whitlam Government
will remember that the administration of its various
programs poisoned the well for that sort of scheme for a
generation and I think the same would be true this time.
But we do have an opportunity in the replacement
schemes to get many of the same characteristics and those
in the field might like to think about how they would
argue their design to the Government so these sorts of
schemes can survive," Dr McIntosh said.

AUSTRALIA: GOVT'S URGENT OIL SEARCH PLANS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Official estimates that Australia has only 14 remaining
years of proven domestic oil reserves have triggered
urgent efforts by the Howard Government to tackle the
problem.

Officials are currently reviewing existing arrangements for
promoting oil exploration to determine what changes are
needed to bolster search programs.

The Government is concerned about the potential
ramifications of local oil supplies running dry - it could
cripple most sections of primary and secondary industry
or add enormously to our annual import bill, thereby
making our exports less competitive on world markets.

Canberra sources have told Scitech the 14 year estimate is
genuine but industry experts are confident there are new
oilfields awaiting discovery in Bass Strait and along the
north-west and northern coasts of Australia.

(Current estimates are that the world has 43 years of oil
reserves, based on known fields and present consumption
trends.)

The dilemma for the Government is deciding what to do
and when to do it. Current levels of oil exploration are
quite high even with existing incentives. And the industry
would be expected to have a vested commercial interest in
maintaining - or expanding - those programs to ensure
continuity of supply in the years ahead.

But some officials fear the industry may try to take
advantage of the looming domestic oil drought by delaying
some programs in the hope that community and business
pressure would force the Government to open its
chequebook and offer much more generous exploration
incentives.

According to the Canberra sources the Government is most
likely to `hasten slowly' - working hard in the background
to develop a range of appropriate measures, but delaying
any formal announcement or implementation until at least
the time of the next Federal Election campaign. This is not
due for another 2-1/2 years.

The Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Warwick
Parer, recently received a draft green paper on a
sustainable energy policy. The final document is expected
to be made public within a few weeks.

Senator Parer said in a subsequent speech: "Of the figures
I have so far, the one that really set the red light flashing
with me was the situation with our existing oil reserves.
With current production rates, and assuming there are no
new discoveries, we've got only 14 years of oil in this
country.

"We have to accept these are accurate figures, put them on
the table, throw them open to discussion, and we have to
work out a policy for how we handle this over the next 20
years," he said.

The Minister said he believed Australia was still "under-
explored", including the continental landmass itself. It was
probably true that most of our prospective new fields
were offshore but there was still ample scope for dryland
exploration across Australia.

The Deputy Director of the Australian Petroleum
Production and Exploration Association, Mr Peter
Cochrane, said putting a figure on existing oil reserves was
"extremely difficult". He agreed that Australia was still
under-explored. Bass Strait production was beginning to
wind-back as the known reserves were being depleted but
"it's not a worry as long as the Australian exploration
regime remains competitive - and we continue to explore
thaose areas the industry believes are prospective", Mr
Cochrane said.

AUSTRALIA: $10M WIND-POWER PLANT FOR NSW

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australia's first grid-connected wind-powered electricity
generating plant is to be built in NSW over the next 12
months at a cost of $10 million.

It will generate about five megawatts of power, estimated
to meet the normal needs of some 3500 homes.

The NSW Treasurer and Energy Minister, Mr Michael Egan,
said the project had resulted from five years' research of
wind patterns at the chosen site, Crookwell (near
Goulburn) in the southern tablelands region. He said it was
hoped the project would encourage more investment in
renewable energy projects as a means of lessening
Greenhouse problems.

The facility, described as a wind-farm, will comprise eight
600kw pitch-regulated wind turbines - three-bladed
propellers mounted on 40 metre towers. They will be built
on elevated ground on a local farm by Pacific Power, one
of the three NSW power-generation bodies established
recently when Mr Egan split the former Electricity
Commission into competitive units.

A local electricity distributor, Great Southern Energy, is a
partner in the project.

The power produced at the site will be channelled into the
State grid, unlike Australia's only other wind-farm (a
stand-alone 2 megawatt local facility at Esperance in WA).

AUSTRALIA: BUDGET CHANGES SLASH ENROLMENTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The extensive package of higher education changes in the
Federal Budget are being blamed for a significant
reduction in preliminary numbers of school-leavers
seeking admission as students for 1997 in some States.

The worst-hit region is NSW and the ACT where first-
round entry applications for next year have seen a drop of
as much as 30 percent from the levels recorded 12 months
earlier. The problem seems to have affected mainly the
smaller institutions -the Universities of Sydney and NSW
recorded drops of around two percent.

But the reduction in applications elsewhere in NSW has
generally been substantial. Examples include: Australian
Catholic University (30 percent), Macquarie (around 20
percent), Wollongong (16 percent), Western Sydney (14
percent), New England (10 to 15 percent), Charles Sturt
(11 percent) Newcastle (10 percent), and Southern Cross
(six to 12 percent).

The ACT figures are also down substantially - ANU (17
percent) and University of Canberra (14 percent).

Collation of these figures has been made difficult because
of a series of administrative problems which have beset
the Universities Admissions Centre which processes
applications for most NSW and ACT universities.

Preliminary 1997 application figures from other States
vary widely, with Queensland's institutions expected to
record (final) increases of up to eight percent. A smaller
rise - around two percent across the board - seems likely
in Victoria. There is no significant change in enrolment
trends in WA, and a very mixed result in SA (Flinders
University has seen a 17 percent increase but the
Universities of Adelaide and South Australia have fallen
slightly).

Observers have blamed the combination of Federal Budget
cuts to some areas of higher education, the big increase in
HECS charges for students starting next year and beyond,
the crackdown on eligibility for Austudy, and moves by
universities to cut courses and staff numbers for the fall-
off in applications. There is still no apparent explanation
for the variation in the trend among the States.

AUSTRALIA: NTEU: UNI CUTS UNNECESSARY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The significant cuts to jobs, facilities, and courses at most
NSW universities in 1997 are unnecessary and do not
reflect the level of funding available to the institutions,
according to the National Tertiary Education Union.

The senior industrial officer with the NSW branch of the
NTEU, Mr Chris Holley, said extensive research undertaken
by the union had found there was no justification for the
range and extent of the proposed cuts already announced
by the universities.

He said half of the 10 institutions had actually received
small increases in their Federal Government funding for
next year when compared with the 1996 figures, ranging
from one percent to three percent. And those which had
been cut had only lost between 0.2 percent and 1.7
percent, hardly requiring the extensive programs of
campus closures, staff cuts, course reductions, and limits
on student numbers which have been announced by some
NSW universities.

Mr Holley said the university administrators behind the
cutbacks had apparently been using the adverse publicity
surrounding the Federal Government's new priorities in
higher education as an "excuse" to do more than was
actually needed to tighten their own budgets. Similarly,
they were attempting to "blame" a long-delayed pay rise
for academic staff for cuts which went well beyond the
level necessary to cover that cost.

The various cuts had also been determined without any
apparent regard for the potential additional income which
was now available to universities by admitting full fee-
paying local students, a source of revenue previously
denied to them by earlier Governments, he said.

According to the NTEU study, the five NSW universities to
suffer cuts in 1997 are: Sydney (Allocation $306.5M; down
0.2 percent), NSW ($233.9M, 0.8 percent), UTS ($134.8M,
0.2 percent), Macquarie ($102.7M, 0.2 percent), and New
England ($84.7M, 1.7 percent).

Those which will have more Federal money are: Western
Sydney ($177.4M, up 1.8 percent), Newcastle ($136M, 1
percent), Charles Sturt ($91.3M, 1.1 percent), Wollongong
($88.1M, 1 percent), and Southern Cross ($48.6M, 3
percent).

AUSTRALIA: STUDENTS: VANSTONE MUST GO

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Student organisations around Australia have called for the
resignation of the Minister for Employment, Education,
Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone,
over her involvement in the "Wright family" saga.

The Minister received front page publicity in national
newspapers when she gave a Senate Committee details of
the "millionaire family" which she said had been abusing
the Austudy system by arranging their financial affairs so
they could receive benefits for their children. Senator
Vanstone said the case had been made public (only the
name had allegedly been changed) to demonstrate the
need for a tough crackdown on Austudy eligibility criteria,
as proposed by the Coalition's first Federal Budget.

The Minister has subsequently been forced to apologise to
the Senate on several occasions as different elements of
the original story were found to be wrong - including the
fact that the family had been a "composite", based on
several things which the Government had feared "might"
be abused.

The Federal Opposition has - unsuccessfully - demanded
that the Minister resign or be sacked by the Prime
Minister for misleading the Parliament. It has now been
joined by student organisations incensed by the various
education cuts and fee increases imposed on the higher
education sector by Senator Vanstone through the Federal
Budget.

A spokesman for the National Union of Students, Mr Van
Badham, said: "All Australians have been lied-to by the
Minister - Senator Vanstone's behaviour is unfit for her to
continue to hold Ministerial office".

The Education Officer of the University of Melbourne
Student Union, Ms Felicity Martin, said: "Thousands of
genuine Australian families will suffer real hardship as a
result of the changes Senator Vanstone has introduced -
and which she has attempted to justify through the
vilification of a bogus millionaire family. She must go".

AUSTRALIA: AFTER LITERACY - NUMERACY FEARS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Following recent controversy about high rates of illiteracy
among Australia's high school student population, there
are fears in academic circles that a forthcoming report on
numeracy and science skills could be equally bad.

The President of the Australian Mathematical Societies
Council, Ms Jan Thomas, said: "We are bracing ourselves
for bad news later this month. That is when the Australian
Council for Educational Research will release the findings
of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study
(TIMSS). This has assessed the skills of children at three
age levels - 9, 13, and 16 - across some 50 countries".

Ms Thomas said the Australian body had decided to start
taking action to review teaching of maths and science in
Australia even before the TIMSS results were announced.
"We are not just waiting for the figures - we have already
arranged a top-level forum at the Academy of Science, in
Canberra, to identify three priority items for urgent
Government attention. It will bring together government,
industry, and education groups - all parties with a real
interest in the future of science and mathematics
education in Australia".

The forum will be staged on November 20. The Minister
for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs,
Senator Amanda Vanstone, and the Minister for Schools,
Vocational Education and Training, Dr David Kemp, have
agreed to speak on the day. Other confirmed speakers
include: Dr Jan Lokan, the Australian coordinator of TIMSS,
and Professor John de Laeter, a member of the Australian
Science, Technology and Engineering Council.

AUSTRALIA: AUST FEES WEST'S HIGHEST

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Howard Government's proposed higher education
charges are the highest in the western world, according to
the Australian Democrats.

Senator Natasha Stott Despoja, of South Australia, said the
increases listed in the Government's Higher Education
Legislation Amendment Bill would, if passed into law,
place Australia behind only South Korea on the world list
of such charges. She said the legislation sought to recoup
60 percent of the cost of providing higher education
services to a student - double the World Bank's
recommended maximum figure.

"The World Bank, in 1994, prepared a report - Higher
Education: the Lessons Experience - which recommended
that students in higher education should not be charged
more than 30 percent of the cost of providing their tuition.
But the Coalition has not only ignored that suggestion, it
has decided to force Australian students to repay double
that figure", the Senator said.

She urged the non-Government majority in the Senate to
use their numbers to block the legislation, thereby sparing
students the consequences of its implementation.

AUSTRALIA: TWO SATELLITES IN ORBIT BY 2001

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australia is now planning to have two locally designed and
built satellites in orbit by 2001.

This follows the Federal Government's announcement of a
$1 million feasibility study into the development of the
ARIES-1 (Australian Resource Information and
Environment Satellite), the world's most advanced
minerals exploration technology.

The remote-sensing satellite will be based on developments
by CSIRO over the past 20 years. The concept uses 256
different frequencies to permit observations which can
effectively strip away layers of vegetation and then closely
check the earth beneath for telltale signs of mineral
deposits in the target area It can also be used to check the
condition of vegetation cover, effects of land degradation,
and a range of other environmental applications.

The Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Peter
McGauran, said the Federal Government will contribute
$300,000 to the feasibility study and a consortium of 10
international mining companies will each provide another
$75,000. He said the project, to be headed by CSIRO, would
also involve Auspace Ltd, and Government Geological
Surveys.

"ARIES-1 is the most ambitious - and potentially the most
commercially rewarding - space project ever undertaken
in Australia. It will offer the most effective means of
mineral exploration anywhere in the world and will
dramatically improve on existing worldwide capabilities
for geological mapping, environmental monitoring, and
land use assessment. It will even have far-ranging defence
applications," Mr McGauran said.

"The level of involvement of the private sector, in
particular the high level of interests from foreign
investors, is to be applauded and encouraged.

"ARIES-1 will be the first Australian built and launched
low Earth orbit satellite and represents a major step
forward for the construction of high-technology systems in
Australia. The Howard Government has saved the
Australian space program from certain extinction - under
the direction of CSIRO it is now headed in a more-focussed
and more-responsible direction than under Labor," he
said.

The Coalition Government had earlier announced (Scitech,
Vol 16, No 9) plans to spend $2 million a year over five
years to design and build an Australian micro-satellite
which would be put into orbit in 2001.

A spokesman for Mr McGauran told Scitech the ARIES-1
venture was quite separate from the earlier
announcement.

The CSIRO Chief Executive, Dr Malcolm McIntosh, said the
basic technology which would enable ARIES-1 to perform
its revolutionary range of tasks had been developed and
enhanced over the past 20 years. Earlier versions had
been carried in aircraft but the time had come to utilise
new developments in micro-technology to build these
capacities into a small satellite.

He said: "Two things about this project are new and special
- one is that we have been able to design such an
advanced piece of instrumentation and the other is that
we are doing the project on a commercial basis. The
traditional way of doing these things is to go to
Government and try to nip into the taxpayers' pockets to
the tune of $100 million or so.

"The Government's pockets are closed at the moment for
those sorts of things, so the choice was either to abandon it
or do it as a serious commercial venture. It is being done
as the latter and Australian companies are now
sufficiently mature and far-sighted as to handle the risks
and to see what benefits it would bring for them to put up
money, at least for the feasibility study.

"If all goes well we would then expect them to put up
money for the production and implementation phase and
Australia will have its first satellite for 20 or 30 years -
one which did little more than beep in the sky." Dr
McIntosh said.

RUSSIA'S 'DELICATE' SPACE DILEMMA

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Russian space officials - and their two Cosmonauts
currently aboard the Mir space station - are desperately
trying to develop an appropriate policy to overcome a
very fundamental problem with the spacecraft.

A combination of factors has meant its sewage storage
tanks are almost full and there is no immediate prospect
of them being emptied. (This task is normally undertaken
by service ships which regularly resupply the space
station and carry sewage and other wastes away for
dumping in space).Technical problems have prevented
regular services for some time and Mir is not equipped
with a dumping system of its own.

To compound the Russians' embarrassment, Mir is
currently playing host to a US Astronaut. And ground
experts have suggested the only short-term solution to the
problem is to physically stir the sewage tanks to lower
existing levels.

The Cosmonauts have so far resisted these suggestions in
deference to the sensibilities of their American visitor,
whom they fear may not have undergone the degree of
training they feel would be necessary to cope with the
smell.

According to Izvestia, the American visitor's "lifetime of
experience may not have prepared him for such
experiments"!

AUSTRALIA: LABOR: GOVT DESERTS INDUSTRY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Opposition has accused the Coalition
Government of having "abandoned manufacturing
industries" and thereby endangering Australia's economic
future.

The shadow Minister for Industry and Regional
Development, Mr Simon Crean said the new administration
in Canberra appeared prepared to sacrifice them on the
altar of market forces. He was speaking at a forum
organised by the Metal Trades Industry Association
(MTIA) in Canberra.

"It has become apparent that there is one overriding
philosophy driving the Coalition - they believe there is
no role for government in manufacturing and so many other
areas," Mr Crean said.

"The first Howard Budget saw a wholesale abandonment of
the government-industry partnership that Labor and
industry had so painstakingly built-up over the previous
13 years. DIFF, EMDG. the R&D tax concession, Austrade,
AusIndustry, the bounty on computers, ships, books and
robotics - measures put in place to help Australian
manufacturers adjust to lower tariff barriers - were axed.
But the most astonishing thing is the fact that the
Government has not even attempted to justify these
decisions, other than as a financial cut,'' he said.

Mr Crean said the Opposition recognised two things which
the Coalition did not: "there is a role for government in
industry policy and there is not a level playing field" He
said money spent on industry programs should be properly
seen as an investment in the nation's future prosperity,
and not merely as a budget cost.

The ALP was currently formulating an updated industry
policy which would include some crucial criteria:

* it must increase net exports in value-added products.

* it must be industry driven.

* it must involve building and maintaining infrastructure
(using Commonwealth and private sectors funds).

* it must involve a Government-industry partnership (to
ensure a proper balance between structural intervention
and market discipline).

* it must encourage an internationally competitive
environment which confronts the need for industry
support and entry barriers imposed by our trading
partners.

Mr Crean said the Opposition, against this background,
would continue to resist such Budget measures as
restrictions on R&D concessions and the abolition of
bounties.

AUSTRALIA: SMALL BUSINESS CREDIT CARD

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australia's first credit card for small and medium business
operations has been launched by the Commonwealth Bank.

Known as the Capital Business Card, it is claimed to offer
such companies easier and cheaper credit on a continuous
basis than other traditional forms of business borrowings.

Accounts, which operate along the same lines as personal
Bankcards, can be established by approved applicants on a
secured or an unsecured basis. Credit limits can range
between $2000 and $100,000.

A business must have been in operation for at least two
years, and be deemed creditworthy, to qualify. An
establishment fee is payable but, other than incurred
interest, there are no other account fees or charges.

The initial maximum interest rate has been set at 14
percent per annum for unsecured accounts. Secured
accounts may carry a lesser rate. The minimum monthly
repayment requirement is 2.5 percent of the outstanding
balance, with a minimum repayment of $75.

A spokesman for the bank said the new service had been
designed to suit the needs of sole traders and small firms.
He said a recent survey by the bank had found that 88
percent of small business proprietors questioned
purchased goods by telephone and 41 percent said they
paid bills by credit card over the telephone.

"The survey results show that many people in small
business use their personal credit cards for business
purposes, partly for the sake of convenience. Our new
business card is expected to prove very popular because it
offers the same degree of convenience while allowing
personal and business expenditure to be separated", the
spokesman said.

AUSTRALIA: COALITION DISAPPOINTS SMES

A major economic survey of the reaction of small business
to the change of Government in Canberra has found that
86 percent feel things are worse - or have not improved -
since March.

The September Quarter Small Business Health Index study,
undertaken by AGB McNair on behalf of the Australian
Society of Certified Practising Accountants (ASCPA),
checked the attitudes of 450 businesses across Australia.

Only 13 percent said economic conditions had improved
under the Coalition administration. This compared with 64
percent who felt there had been no change and 22 percent
who said the business environment had deteriorated.

Despite those results, 21 percent of firms said they
intended to take-on extra staff over the next 12 months
while only five percent indicated they would be cutting
staff numbers. The remaining 73 percent said there would
be no change to their staffing levels.

The quarterly survey, which has established a sound
reputation since its inception in June 1993, is a blow to the
Howard Government which has placed great emphasis on
the supposed speed and scope of its moves to assist small
business.

AUSTRALIA: $4.5M FOR EMR HEALTH STUDY

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government has reversed its earlier stance
and announced a $4.5 million five-year study into the
health effects of mobile telephones and other
radiocommunications devices.

The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator
Richard Alston, and the Minister for Health, Dr Michael
Wooldridge, jointly announced the decision to thoroughly
examine all relevant issues, including the effects, if
any, of mobile telephone towers.

This follows a long campaign from community groups who
claim the rapid spread of mobile telephone technology
throughout Australia should be held in check until it is
proven to be no risk to community health.

The Ministers stressed they had no specific concerns about
the safety of the new technology - the study was merely
being undertaken to ensure that all relevant matters were
properly scrutinised. (Senator Alston subsequently
lampooned calls for the suspension of new tower
construction until the study findings were available).

The project, to be undertaken by the National Health and
Medical Research Council, will be funded through an
increase in radiocommunications license fees - to take
effect this month. The Ministers said individual projects
under the overall study would be contracted to
appropriately qualified Government and non-Government
agencies, such as CSIRO, universities, and major hospitals.

Soon after the local investigation was announced US
authorities released details of a three year study by 16
prominent scientists into more than 12,000 previous
research projects into EMR around the world. (The group
had reduced the original mass of studies down to a 'short
list' of the 500 deemed to be most relevant to their study).

It found that there was no conclusive evidence in any of
the international research efforts to directly link EMR with
any specific health risk.

Even in the case of childhood leukemia, which has been
indirectly linked to residential proximity to high tension
powerlines in a number of studies, the US experts found
no direct causal link. They said they had paid particular
attention to childhood leukemia in the course of their
investigations into EMR research because of the numerous
past suggestions that its incidence rose sharply among
children whose homes were adjacent to overhead
transmission lines.

But their review had found not only that there was no
direct link between the lines and leukemia but there were
several other "possible causes" of the incidence of the
disease among those children who lived near them - such
as the use of herbicides and insecticides to control
vegetation and insect pests along the powerline routes.
The childhood leukemia issue required more specific study
because none of the mass of studies done to date had
produced conclusive results which could explain the
connection.

The mass of EMR studies undertaken around the world is a
clear reflection of the level of scientific and community
interest and concern about the rapid spread of radiation-
emitting devices. Governments, power authorities, and
relevant manufacturers and transmission agencies are in
the invidious position of facing massive pressure to
introduce more and better technology while some critics
allege this (radiation emissions) poses enormous health
hazards to every section of the community.

Should researchers ever find conclusive proof of a major
EMR health hazard from the spread of modern technology,
the social, economic and legal ramifications are too vast
and too complex to contemplate.

AUSTRALIA: LOCAL COMPANY LEADS WORLD GIANTS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A small Australian company, with only 16 staff, has
developed world-leading PC technology which it claims
has left competing multi-nationals at least two years
behind.

Amlab International, based in the Sydney suburb of Lane
Cove, has produced a virtual instrument - a multi-use
hardware and software package which can replace a wide
range of scientific measuring devices across a broad range
of activities (eg vibration, speed, temperature,
respiration).

The system won the inaugural Science Product Innovation
Award at the recent Science 2000 exhibition.

According to the company, the Amlab system, directed
through a Windows-based PC operating system, can
effectively replace traditional measuring devices in
situations ranging from training Olympic athletes to
testing advanced military aircraft. The system enables the
operator to customise the type of instrumentation
required at the click of a mouse. It is claimed to have
almost limitless applications.

Amlab is currently working on a Defence Department
contract as part of the design process for a new simulator
for the Army's Blackhawk helicopters. The system is
already in use with BHP Research, Hawker de Havilland,
Australian Flight Testing Centres, Queensland University of
Technology, Southern Cross University, Sydney University,
University of NSW, Westmead Hospital, the University of
Technology Sydney, and the Australian Materials Research
Laboratories.

Established only seven years ago, Amlab has until recently
concentrated its marketing efforts locally and, as a result,
the system is already installed at 170 sites across
Australia. Last month the company despatched its first
shipment to Japan for use in biomechanics research. The
companie's managing director, Mr David Rosenbaum, said
the Australian device was at least two years ahead of the
technology available from rival multinationals. Its greatest
advantage was its capacity to collect and process data in
real time, he said.

AUSTRALIA: MINISTER: HEED THE "2000 COMPUTER BOMB"

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Australian industry needs to recognise the potential threat
of the "Year 2000 Computer Bomb" - and to take
advantage of the commercial opportunities it presents,
according to the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr
Peter McGauran.

Many computer users, mainly those in SMEs, were still in a
state of denial about the problem, or seemingly unaware
of it. Mr McGauran said: "Companies that refuse to
properly prepare for the new millennium are risking
financial ruin - it is estimated that up to 90 percent of
computer systems will fail, or revert back 100 years, come
January 1, 2000. This is because many current software
programs were not designed to accept the change in
calendar dates which the new century will bring. The
Government is actively examining the possible impact of
this problem on its systems and urges the IT industry to
help make the community aware of the situation".

He said although the potential ramifications were very
serious the "Computer Bomb" also posed a significant
business opportunity for companies which could develop
solutions and market them around the world.

AUSTRALIA: SMART CARD PRIVACY CONCERNS

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Smart card technology will not achieve its full potential in
the Australian marketplace unless the privacy needs and
concerns of consumers are fully addressed, according to
the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Peter
McGauran.

He told a recent industry conference in Sydney the Federal
Government supported the new technology but was also
anxious to ensure proper privacy protection was in place.
This was necessary if the public was to have full trust in
the cards.

"The Asia-Pacific is potentially the world's biggest market
for smart card technology and Australia is well-placed
geographically and technologically to capitalise on this
revolutionary concept. But, to be successful, these
technical advancements will have to be balanced with
appropriate standards and consumer protection
mechanisms. The Government will soon release a code of
conduct for the industry - a world first for this technology
- which is based on the values and attitudes expressed to
us by the Australian community," Mr McGauran said.

GERMANY: WORLD'S FIRST SOLAR/DIESEL CAR

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

A major breakthrough in motor vehicle technology - the
world's first hybrid solar/diesel production car - has been
announced by the German company, Audi. The concept is
based on using its pollution-free solar-powered electric
motor in city conditions, switching to an efficient low-
pollution diesel motor on long haul journeys in country
areas. The company claims the new vehicle, the Audi A4
Avant Duo III, will help reduce city air pollution problems,
help conserve dwindling world supplies of oil, and be
cheaper to run than a conventional car. Another element
to the package is a separate solar-powered recharging unit
which stores electricity during daylight hours for transfer
into the car's batteries at night. This unit can also be used
to divert excess power into the domestic electricity grid,
reducing domestic power bills and contributing to reduced
demand for future power station capacity.

AUSTRALIA: ACADEMY ATTACKS QUANTUM

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Australian Academy of Science has issued a statement
criticising two recent editions of the ABC television
program, Quantum, which were devoted "primarily to the
hazards of vaccination". It said a sister program on ABC
Radio, The Health Report, had given a balanced coverage of
the benefits and limited risks associated with vaccination.
The Academy said vaccination had proven itself over 200
years to be "the most cost-effective procedure in
medicine". Yet, "the main message of the Quantum
programs was that all vaccinations are potentially
dangerous". The Academy said smallpox had been
eliminated worldwide as a direct result of vaccination and
polio was expected to be wiped-out by 2000 if current
programs remained in place, closely followed by measles.
It said Quantum had raised claims about neurological
problems developing in some patients treated with
whooping cough vaccine and paralysis developing in some
after receiving Sabin polio vaccine. Official figures showed
the incidence of such problems was one case in 200,000
(whooping cough) and one case in between one million and
five million (polio), the Academy said.

BRITAIN: BAD NEWS ON MAD COW

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

Exhaustive tests in Britain have apparently confirmed that
nation's worst fears - direct links between mad cow
disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy: BSE) - and a
new variant which has infected and killed humans.

To date a total of 12 Britons and one French national have
died. The tests were conducted by researchers at the
Imperial College School of Medicine, and their results
published in the journal, Nature.

They showed that a "corrupted" brain protein, prion, in the
human victims showed the same biochemical signature as
that found in cats, mice, and monkeys which had died
after contracting BSE.

The findings have huge ramifications for Britain's
population which seemingly was being sold BSE-
contaminated beef for many years while Government
authorities blocked vital information from being released
to the public, while giving assurances that the industry's
practices were "totally safe".

Oxford University and Imperial College London. The
Crafoord Prize is regarded as the equivalent of the Nobel
Prize, but is awarded for basic research in fields not
covered by the Nobel Prize - mathematics, astronomy,
geoscience, biology (with emphasis on ecology), and
medical research into rheumatoid arthritis. It was
established in 1982 with a large donation from the family
of Holger Crafoord, an economist and industrialist, whose
company manufactured medical instruments. The prize
was in recognition of Sir Robert's "pioneering ecological
research".

A Queensland trawler operator has become the first in
Australia - and only the second in the world - to achieve
accreditation under International Standards Organisation
(ISO) 9002. The Minister for Resources and Energy,
Senator Warwick Parer, said Woods Fisheries Pty Ltd, of
Mooloolaba, had established a first-rate export fishing
operation on its vessel, Valkyrie Voyager. He said the
company's staff processed and packed their catch on board
the trawler to the stringent standards demanded by their
Asian customers. The boxes of seafood were transferred
directly from the vessel into airfreight containers. Senator
Parer praised the company for its efforts in helping to
boost Australian fisheries into an export industry now
worth more than $1.3 billion a year. There was ample
scope for a substantial expansion in exports to Asian
markets and other sectors of the industry should follow
the lead of Woods Fisheries in achieving recognised levels
of best-practice, he said.

AUSTRALIA: GOVERNMENT'S SHAMEFUL SILENCE

from SCITECH, November 1, 1996, Vol. 16, Issue 10

The Federal Government's response to Scitech's front page
story last month (Natural Heritage Trust a fraud: Coalition
senior advisor admits) underlines the accuracy of our
information.

Large sections of the article were read into the official
record in the Senate during questions directed to the
Government Leader in the Upper House, Senator Robert
Hill, but he made no attempt to deny any of the specific
allegations. This included the direct claim that the Trust
policy had been a "cynical political invention" of the
National Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Andrew Robb,
and that it had been "imposed" on Senator Hill.

It is traditional in Parliament for the ranks of any
Government to try to laugh-off any particularly difficult
accusations, with loud jeers, much shaking of heads and
mock bravado. This is particularly so if they have advance
warning that trouble is looming.

It was quite clear from the live television coverage on the
day that the Government had no advance warning of our
story - or the fact that it was to be raised in Question
Time.

When the matter was raised the entire Government team
in the Senate sat in stunned and squirming silence. Even
the Minister for Education, Senator Amanda Vanstone,
who regularly keeps up a running commentary throughout
Question Time, sat mute and stoney-faced. The Minister
for Communications, Senator Richard Alston, initially
looked startled by the questions, then cracked a nervous
smile and then turned and gave a very public wink (he
was centre screen at the precise moment) to some unseen
colleague.

Unusually for such a circumstance, the Government issued
no statement of denial or 'clarification' to try to defuse the
serious charges in our story and not one word of denial
has been uttered in subsequent relevant Senate debates
(Telstra {Dilution of Public Ownership} Bill/Natural
Heritage Trust Bill).

Despite its public silence, the Government's ranks were in
uproar behind the scenes because of a witch-hunt trying
to track-down the source of the story. Some innocent
people were wrongly accused of having committed the
'crime' of telling the public the truth about the
Government's phoney promotion of the Trust as a means
of attempting to sell-off Telstra.

Scitech has no dispute with the need for a major national
effort to rectify our national environmental problems.
What we attack is the Government's pretence that the
proposed Trust - with only $1 billion in funding over five
years - can substantially improve existing problems. We
also refuse to accept that the funding of the environmental
program can ONLY come from the sale of Telstra.

Does this mean that once Telstra has been fully sold-off
(Senator Alston has already exposed that objective) the
national environment must go forever without further
funding?

Would it not make more sense - as has already been
widely suggested - to retain all of Telstra and allocate $1
billion every year from its massive profits towards the
same national objective? This would result in five times
the Government's planned level of expenditure while
enabling the community to retain a degree of control over
the fast-changing world of IT&T in Australia.

Why not seek a range of other proposals for funding a
meaningful attack on the environment problems which
Senator Hill has publicly admitted are costing the nation a
minimum of $1.5 billion a year - or seven times the rate of
the proposed Trust spending?

The Government's real intention - to find some political
means to try to confuse or frighten the public into
accepting the sale of Telstra - is clearly exposed by its cuts
to environment spending in the Budget.

And anybody who still doubts what the Coalition is up to
should consider its flat refusal to consider any other
means of funding national environmental rectification.
They might also look at its overall record rather than its
claims of environmental concern.

The Coalition's gross deception over the Natural Heritage
Trust is a disgrace, as confirmed by the shameful and
ashamed silence of its Senators when our story was raised
in the Parliament.
