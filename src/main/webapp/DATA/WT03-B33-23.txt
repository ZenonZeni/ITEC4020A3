A NEW STRATEGY...

We knew this day would come.  Even before we launched the
Distributed Systems Management Report in October 1994,
we knew that network management and systems management
would eventually become indistinguishable.  We knew that
we would have to merge our two newsletters, Distributed
Systems Management Report and Network Management Systems
& Strategies -- for what good is a network without the
systems attached to it, and what good is a system without
a network to connect it to other systems?

NMS&S has been providing information and analysis of
advances in network management since 1989.  Although
managing networks remains a primary concern for many
large companies, the technology has reached a certain
level of stability.  In the last couple of years, there
has been a very strong trend toward extending network
management schemes to reach out to the systems at the
other end of the network.

All four of the top network management platform vendors
have responded to this trend, sealing the merger of the
two disciplines:

* Cabletron Systems last August formed partnerships with
13 companies to give its Spectrum network management
platform systems management capabilities.  The companies
included systems management specialists like Computer
Associates, Compuware, and Tivoli.

* Hewlett-Packard over the past couple of years has added
systems management applications to its OpenView platform.
These include OperationsCenter for operations and problem
management and AdminCenter for configuration and change
management.

* IBM last May introduced SystemView, which forms more
tangible links between the systems management products
it has offered for some time to its NetView network
management platform.  In the future, all the systems from
IBM will be able to be managed from a central point of
the customer's choosing.

* Sun Microsystems early last year built a systems
management solution called Solstice around its net
management engine, SunNet Manager.  Solstice covers eight
different management disciplines with 15 products, and
Sun enlisted the aid of several other companies,
including the some of the same ones that are working with
Cabletron.

These moves are not an end, but a beginning.  Vendors
have a long way to go before they satisfy all of the
management requirements of their customers.  And users
still need to figure out what it is that they need from
vendors, as their networks continue to expand at alarming
rates and last year's systems are connected with this
year's.

The network manager's job isn't getting any easier.  But
in the coming years there will be new ways to do
things -- and a lot more information that can be gathered
from network devices and end systems.  The challenge will
be in choosing the right tools to decipher it all.  We
at DataTrends will lend a hand by keeping you informed
of the latest developments and putting them into
perspective.  Welcome to Systems & Network Management
Report.

MMTF RELEASES FOUR PROPOSED MOBILE MIBS FOR SNMP

The Mobile Management Task Force (MMTF) yesterday
announced the group has finalized a family of Mobile
Management MIBs designed to extend current network
management standards to encompass the multiple needs of
mobile computer users.  In addition, these proposals have
been designed to be suitable for adoption by both the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Desktop
Management Task Force (DMTF).  The release of these four
proposed MIBs marks the culmination of almost a year's
work; Epilogue and Xircom began working on a Mobile
Management MIB at NetWorld+Interop last spring, which led
to the formation of the MMTF in August.

The MMTF has developed four Mobile Management sub-MIBs
that can be implemented as extensions to the Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP): an Adapter MIB, a
System MIB, a Link MIB, and an Extended System MIB.  By
using these MIBs (management information bases) either
singly or in combination, developers can create network
management applications customized for a mobile computer
environment.  For those interested in testing the MIBs,
copies are available from the MMTF via the World Wide Web
at http://www.epilogue.com/mmtf.

"As we discussed mobile management with industry experts,
we discovered there is no single definition for `mobile'
computing," said David Preston, President and COO of
Epilogue Technology, one of the MMTF founding members.
"Some mobile users are looking at cellular solutions,
others at infrared technology, and still others think of
mobile computing as dial-up access.  With such diverse
connectivity criteria, it became clear that if we were
to create a single mobile management MIB to fit
everyone's requirements, that MIB would be so large and
require so much processing power and network overhead it
would be impractical to deploy.  By developing four
different mobile MIBs with specific functionality, we can
help SNMP developers extend more targeted, customizable
network management support to their mobile networking
environments, rather than forcing them to use a
one-size-fits-all approach."

The four mobile MIBs define objects that address
administration issues specific to different aspects of
mobile computing.  The System MIB is designed to provide
data about the mobile system drivers, card and socket
services, power status, and related system conditions.
The Adapter MIB provides information about the mobile
network adapter, including network hardware information,
whether the mobile computer is connected using a wired
or wireless connection, etc.  The Link MIB provides
information about the mobile network link itself, such
as link status and performance, that can be useful in
troubleshooting and optimizing the actual connection.
Finally, the Extended System MIB contains information
about system extensions, such as the Proxy Group.

In creating the four mobile management MIBs, the MMTF
development team consciously worked to draft proposed
standards that would be acceptable to both the IETF as
a Management Information Base (MIB) extension to SNMP,
and to the DMTF as a Management Information Format (MIF)
file for their Desktop Management Interface (DMI).  These
four mobile MIBs have been developed from a core base of
DMI MIFs, analogous to the SNMP MIB.

Using a Common Agent architecture such as those used in
DMI Software Development Kits (SDKs), the MIFs can be
translated into corresponding MIBs.  Thus implementers
can use MIFs under a Common Agent or DMI Service Layer,
or MIBs under an SNMP agent, to provide either SNMP or
DMI support for mobile users in a managed network
environment.

"From the outset, the MMTF has stated that we have no
intention of duplicating the work of standards bodies
like the IETF and DMTF," said Jim Soriano, Vice President
of Product Development for Xircom, another MMTF founder
company.  "By using creating a set of extensible mobile
management objects that can be implemented as both MIBs
and MIFs, we hope to help point the way to a common
solution to mobile management problems that will be
acceptable to both the DMTF and the IETF."

The MMTF's Mobile Management MIBs has been made available
for testing and will be submitted to both the DMTF and
the IETF for consideration later this month.

The Mobile Management Task Force was initiated by
Epilogue Technology Corp. and Xircom Inc., to promote new
standards to administer laptop, palmtop, and other mobile
network computer users. Membership in the Mobile
Management Task Force is open to computer systems
manufacturers, software developers, MIS personnel, and
network administrators concerned with issues surrounding
the administration of mobile computer users.

IBM'S INET TO SPARK INTERNET APPLICATIONS

Application developers can now "test drive" their
Internet applications in a driving course sponsored by
IBM.  IBM announced an iNet porting extension to its
Solution Partnership Center (SPC) in San Mateo, Calif.
The SPC uses the IBM RS/6000 platform, running IBM's
version of Unix, AIX.  The iNet porting facility provides
developers with access to systems, support, and
tools -- either over the Internet or in person at the
SPC.

"We intend to make the RS/6000 the Internet server of
choice," said Tom Fornoff, director of workstation
marketing for IBM's RS/6000 Division.  "We're confident
that developers using this facility will realize the
advantages in performance and flexibility that the
RS/6000 offers."

INET OFFERINGS

The iNet porting facility's complete list of resources,
free to developers (as available), include:

* An iNet porting World Wide Web (WWW) home page at
http://www.spc.ibm.com that provides information on the
center and how to use its resources

* Internet access to a number of RS/6000 systems running
AIX, allowing developers to test drive the platform and
experience its Internet server capabilities

* Scheduled, secure Internet access to a range of RS/6000
servers, software development tools, and technical
support that let developers port or create Internet
applications for the RS/6000 platform

In addition, developers can use the latest RS/6000
uniprocessor, symmetric multiprocessor, and scalable
POWERparallel systems (RS/6000 SP).  IBM development
tools will also be available.  These include products
from IBM and third parties like BlueStone, Illustra
Information Technologies, Lotus, Netscape, Prodigy,
Progressive Networks, RAD Technologies, Spyglass, VDOnet,
Verity, Worlds, Xing Technology, and others.  These
vendors will also provide technical support and training.

Marketing support is also available for Internet
applications created for or ported to the RS/6000
platform.  Marketing support includes a listing on a "Hot
Internet Applications" Web page directory on the SPC's
home page; marketing links with IBM channels, product
divisions, and the Industry Solution Units.

BOON TO BIG BLUE, DEVELOPERS

Industry observers were excited about IBM's announcement
and said the iNet porting facility is a boon to both IBM
and developers.  "This allows IBM to immediately allow
developers to begin testing code, testing new market
ideas -- without building an infrastructure of corner
stores," said Rich Doherty, a director of The
Envisioneering Group (Seaford, N.Y.).

Doherty described IBM's iNet porting facility as a
"virtual service bureau," but said developers who still
want the security and sanctity of testing their
applications in person can take their applications to the
facility in San Mateo.

The Envisioneering Group has accessed the site and built
ports on IBM's supercomputers.  "There's nothing else
like it," Doherty said.  "You can call into the heart of
the technology, try out ideas in private, and have access
to thousands of dollars of development time."

TRY BEFORE THEY BUY

Not only can developers test out their applications,
developers can bring their clients in and walk through
the applications with them to work through any problems,
Doherty explained.  "This is a `try before they buy' set
up," he said.  "You couldn't ask for a better match of
customer and vendor."

Other companies may try to copy elements of IBM's iNet
porting facility, but Doherty said IBM gives developers
lots of access to its system.  "These things are usually
portioned out in terms of minutes, not in terms of tens
of hours," he said.  "IBM has dozens of ports to ensure
that each developer has 22 continuous hours.  That's
unique -- that's not just driving the car around the
block; that's like borrowing it from the dealer for a
weekend."

Another analyst agreed that IBM's interest in Internet
applications is good for the company.  "IBM has a point
of leverage in this new environment -- it's called data,"
said John Robb, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc.
(Cambridge, Mass.).

IBM has huge amounts of data, mostly on its back-end
systems, Robb explained.  "IBM wants to help companies
distribute or publish or integrate that data with their
Web offerings," he said.  "So anything that IBM can offer
in the way of tool sets is positive.  Everyone wants to
Web-enable their legacy systems.  IBM should be in the
business of helping companies do that."

LOTUS LAYS OUT INTERNET STRATEGY

Keeping in line with the trend of major computer
companies going public with their Internet strategies,
IBM subsidiary Lotus Development Corp. (Cambridge, Mass.)
held a conference last month to outline how Notes will
integrate and interact with the Internet.

The company is working with the Internet -- not against
it, was the message Lotus stressed to conference
attendees.  Lotus said it aims to combine its Notes's
messaging and groupware services with the ubiquity of the
World Wide Web (WWW).  As part of that plan, Notes
Release 4 will support key WWW protocols, such as HTTP,
HTML, and Java technology -- which will allow users with
either Notes clients or Web browsers to benefit from
Notes applications.

Michael Zisman, Lotus's executive vice president and CEO,
offered three specific strategies for Notes integration
with the Internet:

* Deliver a Notes server in 1996 that joins HTTP, HTML,
and Java technology with existing Release 4 Notes server
technology to provide a Web development and application
hosting environment

* Deliver extensible Web-enabled business application
frameworks that can be customized by Lotus business
partners and customers

* Extend Notes clients with the InterNotes Web Navigator,
a Notes Release 4 Web browsing facility that allows users
to automate Web access in Notes applications.

LOWER PRICES

Fearing that many companies would shift their
communications onto the relatively low-cost Internet as
an alternative to pricey software, Lotus also lowered the
price of Lotus Notes Mail to $55 per seat.  In addition,
Lotus' InterNotes Web Publisher, which originally sold
for $2,995, will soon be available free via the Web to
Notes.  Also marked for discount are Lotus's upgrade for
NotesSuite Desktop, its SmartSuite desktop productivity
applications, and the NotesSuite Application
Collection -- these will all be reduced by 33 percent,
from $299 to $199.

"The new, more aggressive pricing for Notes will allow
our customers to more quickly deploy Notes throughout
their organizations," said Jeff Papows, Lotus' executive
vice president and chief operating officer.  "In
particular, the new mail client and lower pricing will
make Notes much more attractive for users who need
electronic mail and Internet access."

Lotus said its merger with IBM allowed the company to
establish its new pricing model.  "Lotus can now take a
longer-term financial perspective and position ourselves
as the price and value leader in the messaging and
groupware market," Papows said.

But the company raised the price of its Notes server
software from $275 to $495, rationalizing that the new
and improved software will be able to link more PCs with
Notes to centralized computers.

NOTES IS THE WEB

"Lotus is not giving customers a choice of Notes or the
Web -- Lotus is saying Notes is the Web," said David
Marshak, vice president and senior consultant for the
Patricia Seybold Group (Boston, Mass.).  The concept of
Notes as the Web is very appealing to users because many
browsers don't offer E-mail, Marshak said.  "Lotus offers
additional benefits with its browsing," he said.  "It can
organize the work, run agents against it, have additional
security."

With Notes as a Web browser, users can browse and do all
the things with it they can do internally with Notes --
workflow, connecting to transaction processes, tracking,
and monitoring, Marshak explained.  Marshak praised the
company for lowering its prices.  "Lotus is saying that
the price of the client should not be a barrier to
whatever you want to do," he said.

"Lotus is making a very powerful statement," Marshak
continued.  "Lotus is saying: We want you as Notes users.
Whether you want E-mail, a Web browser, or Notes
applications, we have the best client in any of these
uses."

LOOK FOR VALUE

But another analyst said pricing incentives are not
necessarily the news.  "Pricing is not the issue with
Notes and the Internet," said Tom Austin, research
director with the Gartner Group (Stamford, Conn.).  "The
value is in supporting Web browsers."

Within two years, there will be millions of browsers out
there, Austin said.  "By supporting the browsers and the
Internet protocols, Lotus will have extreme breadth of
capability," he said.  "The value to Lotus is that it
will gain access to 100 million people."

"Lotus is modifying its technology so that anyone with
a Web browser can have access to everything that's on a
Notes server," Austin said.  "Lotus has opened up Notes
to the point where users can take advantage of Notes
server without using a client."

While Lotus has accomplished its Internet goals from a
technical point of view, the company must focus on its
marketing message, Austin said.  "How do they establish
the tens of millions of people interested in the Internet
as Notes users, rather than Netscape users?" Austin
asked.  "That's their problem: marketing."

Lotus needs to figure out how to establish a new positive
image in the marketplace, as well as to make people
understand the benefits that Lotus delivers and to make
those benefits as easy as the Web, Austin said.  "A lot
of people call Lotus groupware `gropeware,' with everyone
groping around trying to find its meaning," he said.
"Whereas the Web is intuitively obvious to users within
five minutes."

"At their conference, Lotus stressed that users can build
great applications.  That doesn't excite people," Austin
said.  "Lotus does the Web, Lotus does groupware --
that's not enough.  Lotus needs a stronger marketing
strategy."

IBM TO EXPAND RMON SUPPORT

Although IBM has supported RMON for some time, the
company is introducing extensions to the network
monitoring standard across its hub products starting in
the next few months.

The extensions include two probe modules, one designed
to resemble the RMON 2 standard once it is finalized and
another to generate test traffic on a local area network.
Right now, IBM has only one probe capable of performing
these functions: an Ethernet probe for its 8250 Nways
intelligent hub which can monitor three Ethernet segments
simultaneously.

In the coming months, IBM will announce these
capabilities for the 8260, at the top of IBM's line, said
Sallie Matlack, an IBM-certified IT specialist.  Lesser
IBM hubs will receive these extensions sometime in the
future.

RMON (remote network monitoring) is an industry-standard
method of collecting statistical data at the physical and
data layers of network segments and sending the data back
to a central site for analysis.  RMON-compliant probes
can also detect problems and send warnings to the
management station.

RMON 2 will expand the range of data that can be
gathered, looking at higher functions such as network
protocols and applications, and will provide an end-to-
end view.

IBM's Enterprise Communications Analysis Module (ECAM)
is a block of software that looks at the same things RMON
2 will when the standard is complete.  IBM has created
a mechanism where ECAM can be automatically downloaded
from a management station into a probe that has been
engineered to accept modules like ECAM.

IBM's other RMON extension, called Traffic Transmission
Management Module (TTMM), can take network traffic
collected through other monitoring tools and spit it out
onto a local segment.  This lets network managers monitor
the impact on that segment via performance monitoring
tools.

PUTTING IT TOGETHER

To handle the information gathered through RMON probes,
IBM last October introduced a version of its software
product Nways Campus Manager - ReMon, a version that
includes ECAM and TTMM.  In November, IBM brought the
software from NetView for AIX to HP OpenView.

ReMon lets managers tell the distributed agents which
packets to capture and send back to the management
platform.  It also displays the information gathered from
the probes graphically.

IDC FORECASTS A GLOOMY 1996 FOR THE INDUSTRY

In spite of a bullish 10-year outlook for on-line
commerce, researcher International Data Corp. (IDC)
yesterday predicted 1996 to be a year of disappointment
as investors and corporations suffer through the
discouragingly slow development of a significant consumer
base.  By this time next year, IDC predicted 20 percent
of the Fortune 500 companies that have commercial Web
sites will close or stop maintaining them, resulting in
"ghost" sites.

On-line information service providers (such as
CompuServe, America Online, Microsoft Network, and
Prodigy) will derive more than half of their revenue from
providing access to the Web by mid-1997.  IDC predicts
that two of the four will struggle to survive.

"In 1996 we predict that the Internet/World Wide Web
phenomenon will shift from today's `intoxication' stage
to a `hangover' stage," said Frank Gens, senior vice
president of research at IDC, the world's leading
provider of information technology (IT) data, analysis,
and counseling.  "The high-flying Internet suppliers will
have disappointing financial results, while technical
capabilities of the Internet are stretched to the
breaking point."

Gens also said IT industry revenues will jump from $500
billion to more than $2.5 trillion by 2010, and corporate
spending on IT will rise from 2 percent of revenues to
more than 5 percent. In addition, IDC said it believes
on-line commerce volume will hit $150 billion or more by
the year 2000 and more than $1 trillion by 2010.

"Some financial service companies, retailers, and
publishers will bail out in the initial hangover period,"
Gens said.  "In the process, they will cripple their
businesses' ability to compete in the growing `virtual
economy.' In contrast, leaders in the emerging electronic
marketplace will significantly increase their
investments. In the process, the seeds will be sown for
the creation of new leadership and the downfall of some
current giants in many industries."

INTERNET APPLIANCES

By this time next year, IDC predicts that manufacturers
of "Internet appliances" -- low-cost devices that allow
the user to access on-line information -- will ultimately
slash prices in half by year's end.

Internet Appliances will arrive in 1996, but the
successful ones won't be priced at $500, Gens said.  They
will come out of the gates at $100 to $300.  The game
console crowd is already slicing away at the pricing for
simple Web surfing devices.  Within two years, Internet
Appliances will emerge as giveaways (less than $100 to
free) by businesses that want customers to access their
on-line services, according to Gens.

"Price competition in data to the home will become
brutal," Gens said.  IDC predicted that high-performance
Internet access will be delivered to the home for as
little as $15 to $20 per month in 1996, down from $25 to
$70.  Pricing will drop to $10 to $15 per month within
the next two years, partially because cable companies
(with the help of affordable cable modems) will play the
Internet card as their first foray in the
telecommunications business.  Telephone companies will
respond with more aggressive pricing.

According to IDC, in 1996 and 1997, suppliers will
aggressively explore new home PC designs to drive down
prices of multimedia devices to $800 to $1,000 (and less)
in an effort to penetrate broader segments of the
increasingly important consumer market.  It will be
paramount for PC vendors to become better acquainted with
the mainstream consumer electronics market and mentality,
and learn a whole new meaning of "price-competitive."
Without doubt, the winners in the PC business in the
coming decade will be those that crack the mass-market
barrier, IDC said.

MICROSOFT

IDC predicted Microsoft will have a great year in 1996,
but its hold will be challenged by the Internet-based
"Revenge of the (Unix) Nerds."  One effect of the
Internet phenomenon of 1995 has been that many on Wall
Street and within the IT industry now are forecasting the
undoing of Microsoft's hold on the industry, and hailing
the rise of Netscape and Sun Microsystems as the new
industry leaders.

"While IDC recognizes the potential of the Internet world
to weaken several of Microsoft's key levers on the
industry, such as OLE and Visual Basic, there will be
relatively little revenue effect from this in 1996," Gens
said.  "We also believe in spite of the recurring rumors
of Department of Justice investigations, Microsoft will
escape any major antitrust activity in 1996, an election
year.  Additionally, Microsoft will conclude that its
ventures into new businesses will have a greater chance
of success without the Microsoft brand."

OTHER PREDICTIONS FOR THE NEW YEAR

* There will be an Internet-driven shakeout in the
application software and application development tools
businesses in 1996 and 1997.  The emergence of the Web,
and the growing importance of entertaining,
multimedia-rich interfaces, will challenge the current
crop of client/server tool suppliers like Microsoft,
Powersoft, Dynasty, Forte, and Seer, as well as
application package companies like SAP and Peoplesoft.

* Software licensing will support network access and
short-term "rental."  Behind the scenes, suppliers are
currently exploring how to "crack the code"  on this
charging model; the leaders will begin experimenting in
the marketplace in 1996 and 1997.

* Large systems will become "politically correct."
High-end servers will increasingly be required to scale
to support direct access by thousands to potentially
millions of users, as opposed to today's hundreds to
thousands of corporate users.  This accelerated scaling
requirement will put pressure on Microsoft's enterprise
strategy due to NT's relatively low-end design point,
and boost the Unix camp's high-end business.
Beneficiaries will be IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Sun
Microsystems, and -- perhaps -- a rejuvenated Digital.

* The increased scope of the Net will favor suppliers
that excel in creating "virtual organizations."
Successful suppliers will be able to play well in a
"virtual organization"  structure -- able to act as
creator, investor, producer, and/or partner.

HORIZONS TECHNOLOGY ENHANCES LANAUDITOR

Horizons Technology Inc. (HTI) recently adopted a
subscription license model for its flagship network
management product LANauditor.  The news coincides with
the release of LANauditor 3.1, which incorporates new
features and major enhancements.  LANauditor provides
continuous hardware/software inventory scanning of local
area networks.  LANauditor works as a standalone product
or can be integrated into popular help desk,
troubleshooting, asset management and accounting systems.
The enhancements in the 3.1 version include:

* Windows 95 and Windows NT workstation auditing

* Audit of registered DMI information

* Enhanced client scanning, including TCP/IP address and
sub-net collection

* New customizable administration screen for up to 46
fields

* Compaq and Dell detail recognition, including BIOS
information

Registered LANauditor 3.1 users will also receive the Win
'95 Migration Tool for free.  This cost analysis tool
lets users determine the productivity gains needed to
recover the potential investment costs of migrating to
Windows 95.  HTI's Win '95 Tool is based on a financial
cost analysis model developed with the chairman of the
Finance Department of the Business School of San Diego
State University.  With more than 20 user-defined
variables for aspects ranging from cost per hour for
training and upgrade support to the cost for hard disk
upgrades, the Win '95 Migration Tool can be applied to
planning scenarios for many types of business.

LANauditor is available in 25-user and 100-user perpetual
license packages from resellers worldwide.  Both packages
include the database and the Console Module to access the
database.  Packages can be integrated to match the node
count of the user network.  For example, two 100-user
packages and one 25-user package will support a network
with 225 nodes.  One year Premium Support is included
with the package product and can be renewed on an annual
and biannual basis.

NEW PACKAGE

With LANauditor 3.1 HTI is introducing its Enterprise
Program for customers who need to manage information from
large sites and desire a lower-cost alternative to
standard packaged products.  Participants in the
Enterprise Program can license LANauditor for either one
year (Gold Program) or two years (Platinum Program).  At
the end of the license period, the user can renew the
license, or the software can be returned to HTI.  The
Enterprise Program allows licensing for exactly the
number of nodes required and nodes can be added at any
time during the licensing period.  A Platinum user can
buy the product outright through a perpetual license for
a small additional per-node fee.

The Premium Support Program is designed to assure users
of continuous enhancements and improvements as PC systems
evolve.  The program includes: free upgrades, quarterly
software dictionary and hardware agent upgrades, free
utilities for LANauditor such as the Win '95 Migration
Tool, free telephone support, free Internet technical
support, free monthly electronic newsletter, and product
tips.

As an asset management tool, LANauditor provides
continuously updated, detailed records of network assets.
For help desk and troubleshooting operations,
LANauditor's reports on changes to network node
configurations highlight probable causes of problems for
quick and easy correction.  LANauditor is the only
inventory product that tracks all user and network
changes that occur between each scheduled inventory.

PLATINUM TECHNOLOGY RELEASES CHARGEBACK SYSTEM

PLATINUM technology inc. last month released CIMS, an
integrated chargeback system for heterogeneous,
distributed computing environments.  The system provides
critical chargeback services that track information
resources used organization-wide.  The CIMS
applications -- including job accounting, chargeback,
cost analysis, resource utilization reporting, capacity
planning, and resource monitoring -- simplify the IS
management process, according to PLATINUM.

On Dec. 13, 1995, PLATINUM technology acquired the
developer of the CIMS integrated chargeback system, the
privately-held BMS of Newcastle, Calif.  BMS will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of PLATINUM technology.  Terms
of the agreement were not disclosed.  The company said
the addition of BMS chargeback software is a key
component of PLATINUM's plan to provide complete,
integrated operations and systems management solutions
for the Open Enterprise Environment (OEE).

HOOKS TO CABLETRON

In related news, PLATINUM technology formed an alliance
with Cabletron Systems.  The company said a broad array
of its diverse software product line will support and
integrate with Cabletron Systems' Spectrum Enterprise
Manager.  As part of a technology alliance to provide
platform integration, PLATINUM will provide its systems
and database management customers the ability to manage
a wide variety of open, distributed enterprise networked
environments using SPECTRUM.

PLATINUM has recently announced additional relationships
with HP and AT&T, as well as development plans for its
own framework, POEMS.

Various point products could be adapted to hook into
SPECTRUM by different means.  The first phase of
integration for most partners is through the use of a
Cabletron-provided toolkit that PLATINUM could use to
enable event passing, database information exchange, and
script integration.  Another phase of integration would
be via published APIs.  Further levels of integration
between SPECTRUM and PLATINUM -- including enhanced alarm
integration and knowledge-based integration -- will be
evaluated on an application-by application-basis.
Regardless, the companies said they are confident the
open nature of SPECTRUM will allow quick integration to
take place.

Among the PLATINUM products being considered for
adaptation to SPECTRUM are:
* Apriori, PLATINUM's client/server help desk product:
customers have the need for network events, such as an
exceeded network threshold, to be reported to the
corporate help desk.

* Xfer, PLATINUM's software distribution tool: IS support
staffs need to have a way to distribute software and
revisions across networks.  When integrated with
SPECTRUM, Xfer actions can be seen from SPECTRUM's
network map, providing a graphical view of distribution
actions.

* AutoSys, PLATINUM's client/server job management tool:
clients need to reliably schedule jobs across their
entire networked enterprise.

* DBVision, PLATINUM's database performance management
and monitoring tool: customers need to monitor and ensure
database availability across networks and assure database
integrity.

* Database management tools: PLATINUM's database
management products support the DB2 family, Sybase,
Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and Informix.  SPECTRUM
exports to these and other popular formats.

WEB SERVER TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT ENABLED

Network security and analysis software vendor e.g.
Software introduced WebTrends 1.0, a way to obtain
detailed analysis of the traffic on web servers.
WebTrends automatically produces reports showing user
activity by market, interest level in specific pages or
services, which products are most popular, and whether
a visitor has a local or national origin.

It offers access not only to the number of potential
buyers who visit a web site but also their demographics.
The program also includes a built-in scheduler to print
reports based on specified criteria.  Reports generated
by WebTrends include statistical and graphical
information that can be viewed either on a local server
or from a remote location, as well as tables and graphs
generated as HTML files that can be edited or viewed by
any browser.

WebTrends also includes an international database of
Internet addresses, including company name and address
by city, state, and country.  Beta and trial versions of
WebTrends are available immediately through
http://www.egsoftware.com.  The retail version will be
available in February 1996 for a suggested single-user
price of $299.

MICROSOFT TEAMS WITH WALL DATA FOR ENTERPRISE
CONNECTIVITY

Microsoft Corp. and Wall Data Inc. released the RUMBA-SNA
Server Solution Pack, which provides an enterprise
connectivity solution for business users.  IBM mainframe
and AS/400 users can now access and use host data from
Microsoft desktops.  The product package consists of
Microsoft SNA Server, five client access licenses for SNA
Server, and five copies of Wall Data RUMBA OFFICE for
SNA Server.  The product is offered exclusively by Tech
Data, a U.S. distributor, and is available immediately
for an estimated retail price of $1,484.  The Solution
Pack is also available in 25-, 100-, and 250-user
versions.

RUMBA OFFICE is a Windows-based software product that
provides access to a range of latent client/server
capabilities on business-critical systems which include
IBM mainframe and AS/400 systems.  It enables users to
leverage business information and applications across the
enterprise.  RUMBA OFFICE also includes Data Access,
which provides direct access to relational databases so
that end users can easily integrate business-critical
data into their Windows-based applications, and
QuickAssist, which can increase productivity by
remembering and entering information in user entry
screens based on previous actions.

Using a client/server architecture, Microsoft SNA Server
offloads the communications processing from host
computers and desktop PCs.  Each PC uses only standard
LAN protocols, such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, Named
Pipes/NetBEUI, Banyan VINES or AppleTalk to connect to
one or more SNA Servers.  The SNA Servers then connect
to the mainframe and AS/400 systems using SNA protocols.

SNA Server offers advanced tools for easy system setup
and centralized graphical administration. It supports
every important PC and network operating system, LAN
type, SNA host connection, and host type. You can connect
clients and manage SNA Servers across LAN and WAN
bridges, routers and over dial-up lines.

ON TECHNOLOGY ANNOUNCES NLM FOR IP ADDRESS MANAGEMENT

ON Technology Corp. announced the first NetWare Loadable
Module (NLM) that provides central IP address management,
a frustrating and onerous task placed on NetWare
administrators in the rush to get Internet access to
every desktop.  Awareness of the IP address management
problem has grown as a result of demand for Internet
access and a shortage of IP addresses under the current
addressing system.

The company said the new product, IPTrack, is the first
implementation of a TCP/IP protocol called Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) specifically designed as
an NLM for NetWare environments.  ON Technology's IPTrack
automates the work it takes for a NetWare administrator
to assign an IP address, maintain a log of address
assignments, track the address if the workstation is
moved, troubleshoot IP address conflicts, and re-assign
inactive addresses.

To purchase IPTrack or receive additional information,
network administrators should send inquiries over the
Internet to info@on.com or visit the ON Technology home
page on the World Wide Web at http://www.on.com.
