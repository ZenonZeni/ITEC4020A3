<h2>MIGRATION NEWS.<br>

Vol. 4, No. 1  January, 1997.<p>


Europe.<p>


Russia and Central Asian Republics</h2>

<ul>


<p>

Moscow's mayor on December 22 said that Russia must introduce a

quota system to regulate the migration of ethnic Russians from CIS countries to

Russia.  He also said that he was concerned about the forced assimilation of

ethnic Russians in former Soviet Republics.  In Sevastopol, Ukraine, where 75

percent of the residents are ethnic Russians, all children are learning

Ukrainian in school. <p>

More than 300 persons from Azerbaijan have lived in a hotel in Moscow for

seven years, with many reportedly afraid to leave the hotel for fear the police

will deport them back to Azerbaijan.  The Azerbaijanis came to Moscow in 1989

as Soviet citizens and now find themselves foreigners.  In theory, those

fleeing conflicts are guaranteed either "forced migrant" or "refugee" status by

the Russian Constitution, but local laws often leave them with no official

status at all.<p>

A UN officer says that in some cities, refugees can not get permanent

residence registration unless they have refugee status, but they can not get

refugee status without residence registration.  <p>

Many Russian cities still operate with the Soviet pass system.  Moscow, for

example, requires residents to carry documents proving that they can work, thus

permitting police to use document checks to harass ethnic Caucasians, who are

blamed for much of the city's crime.  About seven percent of Russia's 150

million residents live in Moscow.<p>

There are an estimated nine million displaced people in Russia, including

3.5 million who escaped civil war or persecution. <p>

There are also an estimated 500,000 to one million illegal migrants from

China, Afghanistan and Africa in Russia, according to government

estimates.<p>

A Jewish family that was baptized as Catholic in Kazakstan 1990, emigrated

to Israel in 1991, and in November 1996 had their application for citizenship

rejected by the Israeli High Court, which noted that the Law of Return,

excludes Jews who have adopted another faith.  The Law of Return permits

spouses and the immediate family of someone who is accepted as Jewish are

allowed to qualify for Israeli citizenship.<p>

Under Jewish religious law, a Jew is defined as a person whose mother is a

Jew.  The Law of Return was drafted to grant Israeli citizenship to those who

would have been persecuted as Jews under the Nazis and was extended to the

grandchildren of a Jew.<p>

Russia and Poland signed an agreement on a visa-free border for Polish and

Russian citizens that has caused an "Eastern Flank scare" in Warsaw.  Polish

newspapers are publishing stories about an impending flood of immigration from

CIS countries.  Polish police believe the visa-free border will produce more

"imported crime."<p>

Polish officials claim that over 1.5 million people are waiting in Russia

for a chance to immigrate to Western Europe.  They fear that many Russians,

Ukrainians and Belarusians may remain in Poland.<p>

Many Russian bazaars operate in Poland; the small scale "suitcase trade" is

estimated at over one billion dollars a year.  Originally peddlers brought

goods with them to sell in Poland.  Today there are illegal sewing factories

around Warsaw that employ hundreds of Russian, Belarusian, Ukrainian and

Lithuanian women to produce clothes. <p>

There may be 500,000 mostly illegal guest workers in Poland.<p>

Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway have agreed to grant asylum to 108

refugees, primarily Kurds, who spent 16 days in 1995 being shuttled between

Russia and Lithuania in a train because neither country would accept them.

They were moved in April, 1995 to Latvia's Olaine internment camp near Riga and

held there for 20 months. <p>

The group's two-year ordeal began when they traveled overland to Moscow.

From Moscow, the group went to Latvia and boarded a boat to Sweden, which ran

aground on an Estonian island.  They were returned to Riga, Latvia and hid

until March 21, 1995, when they began their train journey as Latvia tried to

expel them.  <p>

After a UNHCR complaint against Latvia for holding the Kurds in the train

carriages, which were unsanitary and unheated, they were moved to the Olaine

prison, just outside Riga.  Conditions in the internment camp were reportedly

poor; the camp had a faulty heating system and little food or medicine.  Latvia

still has no legislation on refugees and asylum seekers.<p>

The economies of Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and

Turkmenistan shrank after Moscow eliminated subsidies in 1992 .  All except

Tajikistan are expected to grow in 1996.  Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are

trying to shift from cotton to grains and to exploit their oil wealth, but most

property is still owned by the government, which also sets prices for many

commodities.  Kyrgyzstan has come closest to a Polish-style quick free-market

transition.<p>

Several reports focused on potential environmental emigration from Central

Asia.  In 1960, the Aral sea was the fourth largest lake in the world and

supported a thriving fishing industry.  Water was diverted from the rivers that

flow into the Aral sea to irrigate cotton and today the Aral sea is one-third

its 1960 size.  The water for 54 million nearby residents has been

poisoned.<p>
