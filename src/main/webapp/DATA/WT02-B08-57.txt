<font size=4><b>Skin and Ultraviolet Damage</b><br></font>

Permanent changes in the skin can appear as early as 10 years of age, depending on a variety of factors. Exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays can prematurely age and damage the skin.  Tanning booths have the same effect.  Smoking also causes skin damage.  To best protect the skin from daily environmental exposure, sun protection should be used from a very early age and continued throughout adulthood.<p>



Although no product completely blocks UV rays, there are many lotions and creams available with an adequate SPF (sun protection factor) to protect from the harmful effects of the sun.  For the face, it is recommended that a sunscreen or block of at least SPF 15 be applied each morning and throughout the day as needed.<p>



<font size=4><b>General Cleansing and Hydration</b><br></font>

Skin is often as unique as the individual.  For example, acne prone skin is treated quite differently from severely dry skin.  However, most skin types benefit from some form of cleansing each day.  Cleansers help keep pores clean, gently remove debris and dead cells, and hinder formation of blemishes or blackheads.  Toners or astringents are usually recommended if the skin is very oily or acne prone.<p>



Moisturizing or &quot;hydrating&quot; the skin is also dependent on the individual’s needs.  Often a light moisturizer can help protect the skin from the drying effects of various environmental stresses including cold, wind or air conditioned rooms.<p>



<font size=4><b>Alpha Hydroxy Acid Products</b><br></font>

In the last 15 years, skincare research has produced a number of creams and lotions that literally speed up how fast the skin regenerates.  Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs) which include glycolic acid (also referred to as fruit acids) are derived primarily from natural products such as citric and lactic acids.  When applied regularly after cleansing and before moisturizing, these acids cause skin cells to multiply at a faster rate and improve the bond between those cells.<br>

Results commonly reported include:<br>

<dd><ul>

<li>Smoother, more youthful appearance

<li>diminished appearance of fine lines

<li>more even skin tome, decreased discoloration

<li>reduced inflammation and acne formation

</ul><p>





Some mild side effects during the first two weeks of AHA usage include a slight tingling sensation and /or minor irritation of the treated area.  These symptoms are transient and not harmful.  However, if sever redness or inflammation occurs, product usage should be discontinued immediately.  Direct contact with the eyes and lips should also be avoided.  Pregnant or nursing women may wish to consult their doctor before using AHA products.<p>



Additionally, AHA skin “peels” can be performed by a qualified plastic surgeon or esthetician.  This procedure provides significant results and can be performed a few times throughout the year.<p>
