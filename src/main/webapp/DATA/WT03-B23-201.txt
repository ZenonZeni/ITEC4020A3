<P>Washington Uninsured Motorist Statutes
<P><B>RCW 48.22.030</B> <B> Underinsured, hit-and-run, phantom vehicle


coverage to be provided--Exceptions--Conditions--Deductibles.</B>  <B>(1)</B>
"Underinsured motor vehicle" means a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership,
maintenance, or use of which either no bodily injury or property damage liability
bond or insurance policy applies at the time of an accident, or with respect
to which the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury or property
damage liability bonds and insurance policies applicable to a covered person
after an accident is less than the applicable damages which the covered person
is legally entitled to recover.
<P> <B> (2)</B> No new policy or renewal of an existing policy insuring against
loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury, death, or
property damage, suffered by any person arising out of the ownership,
maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued with respect to any
motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state unless coverage
is provided therein or supplemental thereto for the protection of persons
insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners
or operators of underinsured motor vehicles, hit-and-run motor vehicles,
and phantom vehicles because of bodily injury, death, or property damage,
resulting therefrom, except while operating or occupying a motorcycle or
motor-driven cycle, and except while operating or occupying a motor vehicle
owned or available for the regular use by the named insured or any family
member, and which is not insured under the liability coverage of the policy.
 The coverage required to be offered under this chapter is not applicable
to general liability policies, commonly known as umbrella policies, or other
policies which apply only as excess to the insurance directly applicable
to the vehicle insured.
<P> <B>(3)</B> Except as to property damage, coverage required under subsection
(2) of this section shall be in the same amount as the insured's third party
liability coverage unless the insured rejects all or part of the coverage
as provided in subsection (4) of this section.  Coverage for property damage
need only be issued in conjunction with coverage for bodily injury or death.
 Property damage coverage required under subsection (2) of this section shall
mean physical damage to the insured motor vehicle unless the policy specifically
provides coverage for the contents thereof or other forms of property damage.
<P> <B> (4)</B> A named insured or spouse may reject, in writing, underinsured
coverage for bodily injury or death, or property
damage, and the requirements of subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall
not apply.  If a named insured or spouse has rejected underinsured coverage,
such coverage shall not be included in any supplemental or renewal policy
unless a named insured or spouse subsequently requests such coverage in writing.
 The requirement of a written rejection under this subsection shall apply
only to the original issuance of policies issued after July 24, 1983, and
not to any renewal or replacement policy.
<P> <B>(5) </B>The limit of liability under the policy coverage may be defined
as the maximum limits of liability for all damages resulting from any one
accident regardless of the number of covered persons, claims made, or vehicles
or premiums shown on the policy, or premiums paid, or vehicles involved in
an accident.
<P><B> (6)</B> The policy may provide that if an injured person has other
similar insurance available to him under other policies, the total limits
of liability of all coverages shall not exceed the higher of the applicable
limits of the respective coverages.
<P><B> (7) (a)</B> The policy may provide for a deductible of not more than
three hundred dollars for payment for property damage when the damage is
caused by a hit-and-run driver or a phantom vehicle.<B>(b)</B> In all other
cases of underinsured property damage coverage, the policy may provide for
a deductible of not more than one hundred dollars.
<P><B> (8)</B> For the purposes of this chapter, a "phantom vehicle" shall
mean a motor vehicle which causes bodily injury, death, or property damage
to an insured and has no physical contact with the insured or the vehicle
which the insured is occupying at the time of the accident if:<B> (a)</B>
The facts of the accident can  be corroborated by competent evidence other
than the testimony of the insured or any person having an underinsured motorist
claim resulting from the accident; and<B>(b)</B> The accident has been reported
to the appropriate law enforcement agency within seventy-two hours of the
accident.  [1985 c 328 &#167; 1; 1983 c 182 &#167; 1; 1981 c 150 &#167; 1;
1980 c 117 &#167; 1; 1967 c 150 &#167; 27.]
<P><B> RCW 48.22.040 </B><B> Underinsured motor vehicle coverage where liability
insurer is insolvent--Extent of coverage--Rights of insurer upon making payment.
(1) </B>The term "underinsured motor vehicles" with reference to coverage
offered under any insurance policy regulated under this chapter shall, subject
to the terms and conditions of such coverage, be deemed to include an insured
motor vehicle where the liability insurer thereof is unable to make payment
with respect to the legal liability of its insured within the limits specified
therein because of insolvency.
<P> <B>(2)</B> An insurer's insolvency protection shall be applicable only
to accidents occurring during a policy period in which its insured's underinsured
motorist coverage is in effect where the liability insurer of the tortfeasor
becomes insolvent within three years after such an accident.  Nothing herein
contained shall be construed to prevent any insurer from affording insolvency
protection under terms and conditions more favorable to its insureds than
is provided hereunder.
<P><B>(3)</B> In the event of payment to an insured under the coverage required
by this chapter and subject to the terms and conditions of such coverage,
the insurer making such payment shall, to the extent thereof, be entitled
to the proceeds of any settlement or judgment resulting from the exercise
of any rights of recovery of such insured against any person or organization
legally responsible for the bodily injury, death, or property damage for
which such payment is made, including the proceeds recoverable from the assets
of the insolvent insurer.  Whenever an insurer shall make payment under the
coverage required by this section and which payment is occasioned by an
insolvency, such insurer's right of recovery or reimbursement shall not include
any rights against the insured of said insolvent insurer for any amounts
which would have been paid by the insolvent insurer.  Such paying insurer
shall have the right to proceed directly against the insolvent insurer or
its receiver, and in pursuance of such right such paying insurer shall possess
any rights which the insured of the insolvent company might otherwise have
had, if the insured of the insolvent insurer had personally made the payment.
 [1983 c 182 &#167; 2; 1980 c 117 &#167; 2; 1967 ex.s. c 95 &#167; 3.]
