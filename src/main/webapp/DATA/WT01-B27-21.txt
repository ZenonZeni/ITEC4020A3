<p>MARIJUANA...THE INSIDIOUS DRUG </p>

<p>(Books Pot Safari and Marijuana Alert, Peggy Mann, McGraw
Hill) </p>

<p>THC </p>

<p>Known &gt;300 years for its psychoactivity </p>

<p>delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol </p>

<p>a) regular grade </p>

<p>b) Sensimilla </p>

<p>c) Hashish </p>

<p>d) Hash oil </p>

<p>Needs heat activation (smoking, tea or brownies) </p>

<p>Currently, plain marijuana up to 9x stronger than in 1973. </p>

<p>1973 1983 </p>

<p>reg 0.5% THC 3.5% THC </p>

<p>sensi 6% 10-12% </p>

<p>hashish 8% 15% </p>

<p>oil 15-30% 20-60% </p>

<p>Regular grade...seeds etc. Backyard variety </p>

<p>Sensimilla &quot;preferred&quot; mature seedless female plants
grown away </p>

<p>from male. The largest cash crop of California, Oregon and
Hawaii </p>

<p>and second nationally behind corn. One plant costs $200 to
grow, </p>

<p>worth up to $2500. 25% is grown in US national forests, often </p>

<p>booby-trapped. In 1975 worth $400 per pound, now $3500 per
pound. </p>

<p>In Ohio in 1987 25% of plants confiscated, about 255000 plants
</p>

<p>left or $540 million. </p>

<p>Hashish...made in Pakistan/Afganistan and imported.
Deteriorates </p>

<p>at about 10% per month. </p>

<p>Hash Oil is the concentrated form which is put on a cigarette
to </p>

<p>double the potency. </p>

<p>PHARMACOLOGY </p>

<p>More carcinogens than tobacco. More lung irritation than
tobacco. </p>

<p>More number of carcinogens than tobacco. </p>

<p>If ingested has erratic absorption and is deactivated in the </p>

<p>liver like narcotics are...thus less potent but longer high. </p>

<p>If smoked, about 100% of the THC is absorbed into the </p>

<p>pulmonary system and then into the fatty system ie. brain, </p>

<p>testicles and ovaries, heart. </p>

<p>See reddened eyes and increased heart rate due to THC. </p>

<p>ANIMAL STUDIES </p>

<p>THC attaches to the cerebellum, spinal cord and hippocampus. </p>

<p>Hippocampus is responsible for short term memory. If removed--
</p>

<p>global amnesia. THC in rats causes brain cell death. </p>

<p>Monkey studies...smoke 5 days/week x 1 year then free x 1 </p>

<p>year caused profound lack of interest in learning and no
memory. </p>

<p>Same experiment smoking weekend only caused moderade damage
and </p>

<p>loss of memory. These were permanent changes. </p>

<p>Does it do this in humans? Our current users will be the </p>

<p>guinea pigs for this experiment. Scientists expect the answer
to </p>

<p>be yes. </p>

<p>EFFECTS IN HUMANS </p>

<p>Affects behavioural mood and memory functions. Decreases
cerebral </p>

<p>blood flow while smoking. </p>

<p>Of students failing or leaving school, 1/25 were not pot </p>

<p>users, 3/5 of students regularly smoking pot failed. </p>

<p>Flight simulator and pilors after 1 cigarette...each pilot </p>

<p>did significantly worse with one pilot missing the runway. </p>

<p>Significantly, all pilots thought they were doing very well. </p>

<p>The single greatest risk factor for cocaine abuse is </p>

<p>marijuana use before age 15. </p>

<p>AMOTIVATIONAL SYNDROME </p>

<p>1. Loss of interest, apathy, desire to work </p>

<p>2. Fatigue, loss of energy/tiredness </p>

<p>3. Depression/attacks of rage when provoked </p>

<p>4. Slovenliness in habits and appearance </p>

<p>For chronic users, clearly has been shown that memory tests
and </p>

<p>auditory and visual retention tests were poorly done even
after 6 </p>

<p>weeks of sobriety. </p>

<p>In a study of alcohol/pot related accidents, suggested pot may
be </p>

<p>responsible for more accidents than alcohol (due to impaired </p>

<p>judgement etc) </p>

<p>In a number of cases, heavy use 4-5x a week up to 15
cigarettes </p>

<p>per cay caused amnesia for the first 7-8 days of sobriety. </p>

<p>Amnesia was not recognized by the user. </p>

<p>Sheba=PCP added. Smells like embalming fluid </p>

<p>Few drops of vinegar in urine will give negative marijuana
test </p>

<p>Drug screen 50-75 level CANNOT BE PASSIVE. No false positives.
It </p>

<p>is like a fingerprint. In a job screen should always do a </p>

<p>confirmation titer if a screen is positive. </p>

<p>CHEMICALS IN MARIJUANA </p>

<p>421 chemicals. 65 are different cannabinols which are </p>

<p>psychoactive (delta-nine most) Others include non-cannabinols </p>

<p>such as toxins, carcinogens (such as tar, just like the tar on
the </p>

<p>road) and inactive or potentiating agents </p>

<p>Alcohol takes 6-8 hours to get out of body </p>

<p>THC is fat-soluble, and 50% will be in the body 1-2 weeks
later. </p>

<p>May take up to 4 months to get all out. Heavy use for 6-12
months </p>

<p>will give positive drug screen 4-6 weeks later. </p>

<p>A chronic pot user is raraly sober. Subclinical </p>

<p>intoxication. 2-3 times a week sufficient for this. Level </p>

<p>released from fat as acute level drops. Stored in all fat and </p>

<p>also in the basic building cells of the body. </p>

<p>Damage is DOSE RELATED. Depends on frequency and on </p>

<p>concentration. The more mature the person the less permanent </p>

<p>damage. Symptoms are insidious and subtle and can parallel </p>

<p>adolescent adjustment symptoms. THC exaggerates these
symptoms, </p>

<p>makes them more profound and often permanent. Saturation in
the </p>

<p>brain causes memory impairment, concentration impairment and </p>

<p>motivation impairment. Can be a major personality change. As
the </p>

<p>brain level decreased THC moves from other body fat to the
brain </p>

<p>to keep the brain saturated. Can actually prevent the
cognitive </p>

<p>changes needed for an adolescent to change to an adult,
leaving </p>

<p>him/her with poor social judgement, poor attention span,
confusion </p>

<p>and anxiety and loss of train of thought. Occasionally
produces </p>

<p>hyperactive/aggressive/agitated person instead of apathy. This
</p>

<p>damage can occur in MONTHS rather than years. ALL USERS </p>

<p>REGARDLESS OF AGE AND ABILITY HAVE DECREASED ABILITY IN
COMPARISON </p>

<p>TO THEIR POTENTIAL ABILITY. Regression to immaturity can occur
</p>

<p>and can be irreversible. A teenager can develop, for example,
a </p>

<p>mental age of 11 and thus not be able to complete school work </p>

<p>causing a dropout from school. </p>

<p>Pot more potent than in past years, age of onset much earlier </p>

<p>and thus the profile of a marijuana user is changing. </p>

<p>a) much higher suicidal ideation and depression </p>

<p>b) 1/3 show borderline schizophrenia traits with disorganized </p>

<p>thought patterns. </p>

<p>c) Paranoia increasing </p>

<p>d) Lots of similarities to a senile adult. Difference in time </p>

<p>perception (10 minutes seems like 1 hour). Erratic junk foods.
</p>

<p>Poor judgement. Cannot self-correct. Much like Altzheimer's </p>

<p>disease. </p>

<p>e) As use continues with subacute intoxication, decreasing </p>

<p>cognitive ability, decline in emotional life, much increase in
</p>

<p>stubbornness. More fatigue, decreased ability to do complex </p>

<p>tasks, no self-insight, no idea of time and dates, impaired
short- </p>

<p>term meory and occasionally long-term as well. With Moderate
dose </p>

<p>get profound gross impairment of motor skills. (See how much
like </p>

<p>brain-damaged adult?) With high dose can get hallucinations. </p>

<p>Feel that THC may be the cause of massive adolescent
psychiatric </p>

<p>problems. MUCH PROOF HERE and much refusal of the user to take
</p>

<p>this information seriously...still relying on the information
from </p>

<p>the 1960s that THC was not harmful. User does not wish to look
</p>

<p>the data straight in the eyes. </p>

<p>Major driving impairments...&quot;behavioural toxicity&quot;.
The </p>

<p>stoned person does not perceive the dangers. He can briefly
hide </p>

<p>the influence and pay attention but easily loses focus. Coming
</p>

<p>down from a high may be the worst for motor skills.
Occasionally </p>

<p>get a triggered unexpected after-high. </p>

<p>39% more likely to have a driving accident if smoke THC and </p>

<p>drive. Reckless driving, failure to yield, failure to stop. </p>

<p>How to tell if the memory/behavior is THC? STOP for two </p>

<p>months and see if symptoms go away. </p>

<p>MARIJUANA ADDICT </p>

<p>1. First stage is exposure. </p>

<p>2. Second stage...the person learns the mood swing, starts to
use </p>

<p>it as a drug and seek it and plan for its use = second stage
of </p>

<p>addiction. </p>

<p>3. Third stage..user becomes preoccupied with the mood swing. </p>

<p>Develops tolerance. May use 3-4 x per day up to 15 per day =
much </p>

<p>increased tolerance. Develops a preoccupied with chemical </p>

<p>dependence life style. </p>

<p>4. In the fourth stage the addict is using the drug to be
NORMAL. </p>

<p>Uses first in the AM, last at night, using it just to
function. </p>

<p>*Stages three and four...the patient usually cannot stop on
his </p>

<p>own but needs a formal treatment program. </p>

<p>For those who have smoked more than 1000x in three or four
years: </p>

<p>70-80% have tried cocaine </p>

<p>1/3 have tried heroin </p>

<p>Only 0-1% of heroin users never smoked pot. </p>

<p>The percentage of use of cocaine is directly related to the </p>

<p>frequency of use of pot. </p>

<p>In stage four with increased tolerance the addict uses more </p>

<p>of the higher grade THC, starts mixing drugs, seeks out more
heavy </p>

<p>using friends. The addict is very seriously disabled with
social </p>

<p>and psychological disabilities, panic attacks, nausea et.c Ego
</p>

<p>deterioration develops (with the denial that the drug causes
the </p>

<p>problem, it follows that the person himself must be causing
the </p>

<p>problem. This brings out guilt and shame which recycles to use
of </p>

<p>more drugs). </p>

<p>See social and school deterioration, dropping off team, </p>

<p>dropping hobbies. Finally psychotic-like fog in thinking. </p>

<p>**This can last as long as two or more years after drug
cessation. </p>

<p>SYMPTOMS CHECKLIST FOR LEVEL OF ADDICTION </p>

<p>Three predominant symptoms are </p>

<p>a) progressive chemical use </p>

<p>b) chemically oriented lifestyle </p>

<p>c) increasing tolerance </p>

<p>Parents should be aware...addicted teenager will use avoidance
</p>

<p>techniques, visine in eyes, frequently changes the room (more
drug </p>

<p>oriented pictures etc) dropping grades. </p>

<p>Often a strong family history of chemical dependency or
alcohol </p>

<p>dependency. Usage of THC not hereditary but the addiction </p>

<p>development probably is. </p>

<p>TREATMENT </p>

<p>Marijuana is an isolator. Questions asked are &quot;Where did
you </p>

<p>get it&quot; and &quot;How can I get some&quot;. NOT a drug
that explores </p>

<p>feelings. Feelings (mad glad sad) tend to be suppressed. </p>

<p>Treatment must explore feelings and teach its vocabulary.
Group </p>

<p>therapy can help. </p>

<p>Treatment must teach alternative ways to cope...how to handle </p>

<p>a headache (user does not handle pain well...has avoided the </p>

<p>feeling of pain in the past). Must set rules and limits. Must </p>

<p>address the amotivational syndrome in the treatment program. </p>

<p>Avoid the assignment to &quot;read a book and write how to
talk </p>

<p>with people&quot; but give the assignment to DO the behavior.
Remember </p>

<p>the immaturity and the age level caused by the drug when
making </p>

<p>assignments. </p>

<p>Treat the denial. &quot;No big thing&quot; is not true. You
have </p>

<p>school failures, family dysfunctions etc. </p>

<p>Work with the twenty harmfuls to get to deal in reality. </p>

<p>encourage that what is real within the group can occur outside
of </p>

<p>the group as well. <br>
