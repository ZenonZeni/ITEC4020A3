<HR SIZE=4>
                                  
<P>I would like to begin my term by expressing appreciation for the good work that out outgoing President, Joe Friend, did at the helm of AMI of Maryland.  His time and efforts aptly provided the guidance and leadership necessary during an important time of change for our organization.  In 1996-1997, AMI of Maryland endeavors to continue moving in new directions to build on the momentum the state board of directors started in 1995-1996.</P>

<P>Several important opportunities present themselves for our Affiliate leaders to help us build the organization to achieve our mission.  We invite your enthusiastic participation in the following 1996-1997 statewide projects:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Journey of Hope Program
<LI>Maryland Campaign to End Discrimination- Bev Hoffberg, Project Coordinator
<LI>Public Policy Committee - Marcia Pines, Chairperson
<LI>Fundraising Committee - Don Boardman, Chairperson
<LI>State Convention Committee
<LI>Managed Care/Medicaid Service System Improvement Grant- Joe Friend, Project Director

</UL>
<P>Without broad affiliate and member involvement we will have difficulty reaching our goals.  I hope we can count on your support this year.  </P>

<P>Janet Edelman spent many hours developing and designing the new AMIMD home page and we appreciate her efforts.   AMI of Maryland is proud to be one of a handful of states that have home pages.  Janet has invited your comments and suggestions regarding the home page. </P>

<P>Thanks to our outgoing AMI of MD board members, Barbara Murry, Dick Kopp, and Harriet Baldwin who contributed many hours of their time and shared exciting ideas.  I would like to welcome our new board members as part of AMI of MD.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Al Englert

<LI>Hope Mahoney

 <P>I am looking forward to working with you this year to make it the best year ever!</P>

<A NAME="NAMI Convention">

[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]
<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"> <H2>NAMI Convention
</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

	<P>The 1996 NAMI Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee, July 5th to 9th, drew one of its largest attendances in recent years with an estimated 2000  registrants.  The title of the convention was "Grassroots Jubilee".  The importance of NAMI grassroots was repeated throughout the convention and the need for the grassroots organizations to grow and become stronger was emphasized.</P>

	<P>One of the most important themes of the convention was NAMI’s Campaign to End Discrimination which is working for an end to discrimination against people with serious mental illnesses.</P>

	<P>NAMI helped to convene a Fairness Coalition which included many of the major professional organizations.  NAMI together with other members of this coalition developed an open letter to the U.S. Congress, signed by 50 organizations, most of whom were businesses around the country.  A study was commissioned to study insurance premium costs that might result from parity for treatment of mental illness.  Three large data bases showed that claims for mental illness treatment accounted for 1 percent or less of all health claims in private insurance.</P>

	<P>Agnes Hatfield of Prince Georges County received the distinguished service award from the Curriculum
 and Training Committee at the NAMI Convention.  Dr. Harriet Lefley of the University of  Miami presented the award citing Agnes’ roles in initiating the Curriculum and Training Committee, her pioneering work in the study of family burden in mental illness, and her early work in conceptualizing and promoting family education.</P>

<A NAME="Journey of Hope">

[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]
<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"> <H2>Journey of Hope Overview
</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

<P>AMI of Maryland has received a grant from the Mental Hygiene Administration to begin the Journey of Hope Program in November of 1996.</P>

<P>Research studies indicate that 40-65% of adults with severe and persistent mental illness either reside with their families or receive primary care management from their families.  The ability of family members to provide a benign, understanding and predictable environment for their ill relative is a key factor in the capacity of the ill family member to stabilize and remain in the community.  The Journey of Hope not only provides basic education and skill training for families who must cope with the difficulties of their ill relatives, it also gives them the practical and emotional support to sustain them in the role as primary caretakers in the community mental health system.</P>

<P>There are two components to the Journey of Hope - an education element and a support group element.  Together they provide maximum benefit to the family member.  The program is self-selective, however, in that a family member is not required to participate in one component in order to participate in the remaining component.  Families are, however, strongly encouraged to take advantage of both.</P>

<P>The Journey of Hope family education program is a 12 session course for families of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.  These families may or may not be AMI members.  The curriculum focuses on three major psychiatric illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression), emphasizing the clinical treatment of these illnesses and teaching the knowledge and skills that family members need to cope more effectively with the mentally ill relative.  The courses are taught by trained AMI family member volunteers in a team teaching approach.</P>

<P>The Journey of Hope support group program is an on-going support structure for families.  Again, family members are trained to facilitate as these groups provide family members with an opportunity to reinforce coping skills, to seek emotional support and receive practical help from other family members.  Based on the Ten Principles of Support, the groups guide efforts of individuals to help themselves and each other.  In this family-to-family support group model, families learn they are not alone; that there is hope; that there is information; and that individual family member experience is a powerful tool for help when shared with others.

<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><H2>President's Message  --
   Spring, 1996</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

  <P>   We not only survived a long and unusually tough
winter, we achieved some victories in the legislature
thanks to Janet Edelman, Chairperson for Government
Relations, and other key people including the Affiliate
Presidents, Phil Livingstone, Marcia Pines, Art Tate and
all the members who made calls and wrote letters to state
legislators.  Your actions made a difference in the
passage of Senate Bill 750 on Managed Care and
Medicaid Waiver Reform.  With support from the
Governor, the bill passed with amendments
recommended by DHMH including provisions for
specialty mental health services.  We must now pay
attention as the regulations are developed and as the
structure and operating guidelines are developed for the
managed care companies and traditional providers such
as the Core Service Agencies.</P>

 <P>    Other accomplishments this winter include the
strategic and tactical planning by the AMI of MD Board
of Directors beginning with an all-day Board Retreat
facilitated by consultant, Sherry Welch, in February.  The
Board agreed upon five priority areas (of over 20
considered) to focus upon during the next fiscal year:</P>

<UL>

<LI>     Public Policy/Government                            
            Relations/Legislative Issues
<LI>     Stigma
<LI>     Fundraising
<LI>     Structure, Strategy, Systems, Mission
<LI>     Affiliate Development/Relations
</UL>

<BR>
 <P>    To address these priorities effectively and
efficiently the board reorganized with a simplified
structure designed to focus the board and strengthen
committees.  The board is also developing its goals and
objectives and will present these in a report at the 14th
Annual Convention in June.  Special appreciation to the
following who have either just stepped down or agreed to
serve as Chairpersons of Committees:</P>
<UL>
<LI>  Janet Edelman, Chairperson of Government        
                   Relations (outgoing)
<LI>     Marcia Pines, Chairperson of Government          
                  Relations (incoming)
<LI>     Don Boardman, Chairperson of Fundraising
<LI>     Bev Hoffberg, Project Coordinator, Stigma
<LI>     Carolyn Knight, Annual Convention
<LI>     Gail Livingstone, Annual Luncheon
<LI>     Art Tate, Managed Care

</UL>
<BR>
  <P> 
  We would like to welcome Carolyn Knight,
President of AMI of Montgomery County as a new
appointee to the Board of Directors for AMI of MD. 
She has agreed to fill a vacancy.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>

<P>     In this issue we introduce Katasha Smart-Davis, Administrative
Assistant to the staff of AMI of MD.  She works with us full-time while
continuing her studies part-time as a student at Johns Hopkins University. 
You will hear her cheerful voice if you call the office.  Please welcome her
aboard.</P>

 <P>  
  This is the busiest time of the year for AMI of MD with the
legislative season ending and preparation for major events including the
Annual Luncheon with E. Fuller Torrey as the guest speaker and the 14th
Annual Convention.  Additionally, we have gone through a planning process
with the Board and revitalized AMI of MD committees as reported by Joe
Friend, President, in this issue.</P>

<P>     Your state organization has added two new projects, the Stigma
Project (part of NAMI's 5-year campaign) to be kicked off at the 14th
Annual Convention and The Journey of Hope Program scheduled to begin
in the fall thanks to a grant from the Mental Hygiene Administration and
administrator, Donna Wells.</P>

 <P>    We would be remiss not to thank Dr. Agnes Hatfield, Project
Director, and Shirley Jackson, Outreach Worker for their hard work during
the second year of the project for Elderly Caregivers of Persons with Mental
Illness funded by the Department of Human Resources with help from
Catherine Bailey, and Marta Archer  and Sandy Sundeen.</P>

   <P>  
Joe Friend has taken the helm as Project Director of the Managed
Care/Service System Improvement grant and will be attending a conference
in Philadelphia the first week in May.  This grant has enabled AMI of MD
to purchase fax machines for each Affiliate organization which does not
already own one.  This will improve communications as  we move forward.</P>
