Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
John Carey Posthumously Receives Young Investigator Award


One of the nations leading AIDS caretakers is gone.

Recognized as an outstanding physician during his life, John Carey of Case
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, posthumously received the Young
Investigator Award of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group.

The award was made during the opening session of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.

Carey's co-worker, Case Western researcher Michael Lederman, delivered a brief
eulogy.

"John was the finest physician I have ever known," Lederman said.

Dr.  Carey, 41, not only provided primary care to some 300 people with HIV
infection but also was a major investigator in ACTG clinical trials.  He was
author or co-author of numerous publications.

The award was given to Carey's mother.

"The one thing John should be remembered for is that he urged us to treat
patients as people, to allay their fears and to give them hope," she said.

The presentation was met with a prolonged standing ovation by the assembled
researchers.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

Disease Markers
Increased Soluble CD14 Useful Marker in TB Patients


Increased levels of soluble CD14 are present in bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.

CD14 was first identified as a marker of cells derived from the
monocyte/macrophage lineage, although it was later found on other cells like
neutrophils and B lymphocytes.  The cell surface glycoprotein serves as a
cellular receptor for complexes of lipopolysaccharide with
lipopolysaccharide-binding protein.

Soluble CD14 (sCD14) is present in normal plasma and is found increased in
serum of patients with septicemia, polytrauma, and sarcoidosis.  In pulmonary
sarcoidosis, increased levels of soluble CD14 have been detected in serum and
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.  In this study researcher Gerhard Hoheisel
and colleagues attempted to determine whether increased levels of CD14 are
also found in pulmonary tuberculosis ("Increased Soluble CD14 Levels in
Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid in Primary TB," Chest, December
1995;108:1614-1616).

Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in 12 patients with active but untreated
pulmonary tuberculosis and 12 healthy persons.  Cytologic and immunologic
characteristics were determined.  sCD14 was measured by a sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

"The level of soluble CD14 in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis was
increased compared with controls (mean +/- 34.4 +/- ng/mL versus 11.5 +/- 22
ng/mL)," Hoheisel et al.  wrote.

"No correlation was found between sCD14 levels and bronchoalveolar lavage
supernatant of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.  We conclude that similar to
patients with sarcoidosis, increased BAL fluid levels of sCD14 are found in
patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis compared with controls.  Moreover,
this finding might signal a similar immunopathogenetic process contributing to
granuloma formation in both diseases.  Further studies of respective cell
surface markers and endogenous cytokine production seem necessary to determine
the significance and clinical relevance of this finding."

The corresponding author for this study is Gerhard Hoheisel, Department of
Pneumology, Ruhrlandklink, Tuschener Weg 40, D-45239.

Drug Development (Antiviral)
Virus-Neutralizing RNAs Offer Potential as Antiviral Therapies


An in vitro selection process of RNA analogs derived from infectious viral
particles turns up elements with antiviral activity.

Current drug development techniques are dependent on the discovery of useful
agents.  Compounds with antibacterial or antiviral activity are often found
through the empirical screening of synthetic and natural compounds or the
logical design of a drug based on structures of viral and cellular proteins.
Unfortunately, empirical screening is tedious and inefficient, and logical
drug design, although promising, has not produced an abundance of successful
compounds.

Weihua Pan et al.  extended a selection-amplification procedure, previously
used to isolate RNA and DNA molecules, to target an intact virus in hopes of
discovering RNA analogs that could be developed as antiviral drugs ("Isolation
of Virus-Neutralizing RNAs from a Large Pool of Random Sequences," Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11509-13).

"The isolation of RNAs and RNA analogs that are effective against diverse
viral strains will be particularly necessary for inhibiting viruses such as
HIV, which has a high mutation rate and readily develops drug-resistant
strains," stated Pan et al.  "Such selection is possible and practical because
a very large structurally diverse library is used and the selection is a rapid
process."

The authors noted that there is great potential to select for molecules that
bind defined targets with high affinity and specificity due to the structural
complexity of a combinatorial sequence library of single-stranded RNA
oligonucleotides.  Due to technological advances, selected RNA molecules can
be amplified and subjected to further selection.  Multiple cycles of selection
and amplification can lead to the isolation of the best target-binding RNA
molecules from the library.

Among the family of Retroviradae (which includes HIV), the rous sarcoma virus
(RSV) has been extensively studied.  All Retroviridae viruses are envelope
viruses which use surface glycoproteins to bind to a specific receptor on a
susceptible cell and for fusion with the cellular membrane of the host.

As a model, the authors chose to target intact RSV in order to isolate the RNA
molecules and the nuclease-resistant RNA analogs that specifically bind and
neutralize this virus.

RSV was used to demonstrate that antiviral RNA and RNA analogs could be
systematically and effectively isolated from a large pool of random sequences
without prior knowledge of the structures of the viral proteins.  First, they
used intact viral particles to select from the sequence pool the RNAs and RNA
analogs that bind specifically to the virus.  Then they screened the selected
molecules for the ability to neutralize the virus.

"We reason that by binding to virus, some of the selected RNAs and RNA analogs
may change the structures of viral surface proteins so that these proteins can
no longer function in steps critical for viral infection, such as viral
attachment and virus-cell membrane fusion," stated Pan et al.  "Alternatively,
some of the structural changes may trigger pathways to inhibit the steps which
normally occur after virus internalization, such as the uncoating and the
expression of the virus genome."

J.A.  Levy et al.  (Am.  Soc.  Microbiol., 1994;153-158) and N.J.  Dimmock et
al.  (Curr.  Top.  Microbiol.  Immunol., 1992;183:1-149) suggested the
possibilities in both of these avenues in some of their earlier work.

Using infectious viral particles, RNA and ribonuclease-resistant RAN analogs
that bound and neutralized RSV were isolated from a large pool of random
sequences by multiple cycles of in vitro selection.  Because RSV imposes
permeation problems, the selected RNAs were targeted to inhibit RSV infection
by binding to the virus surface, and not by entering the virus itself.

The sequences chosen completely neutralized the virus at concentrations of
0.16 (micro)M.  Of the 19 selected sequences isolated to be concentrated, five
of them inhibited RSV infection after cloning.  These five RNA and RNA analogs
neutralized the RSV by interacting with the virus itself.  They did not
adversely affect the host cells used in the in vitro experiments.

A potential problem with developing RNA as a therapeutic agent is the rapid
degradation of unmodified RNA by ribonucleases in vivo, noted the authors.
They suggested solving this problem by incorporating modified nucleotides into
the RNA chain.

The strain of RSV used during the experiments was the Prague A.  After testing
the selected RNAs against a different strain, the Prague C, the authors found
that the RNA analogs inhibited infection of this strain also, although at
concentrations 15-20 times higher.

Future methods of RNA selection could be performed by alternating between
several strains of virus during the different cycles of selection to
specifically isolate the RNAs and RNA analogs that could bind to several
diverse strains of the virus.  This could be particularly helpful when it
comes to treating viruses with a history of multiple mutations such as HIV,
noted the authors.

Several advantages were noted by the authors for the use of intact biological
entities (infectious virus particles) instead of viral proteins:

* Selection by intact viral particles does not require the full understanding
of all the ways that a virus can infect its host.  If selection is made by an
isolated viral protein, the selection is limited to only the cases in which
proteins responsible for viral infection have been identified and isolated.

* It avoids the problem of structural differences in purified proteins.
Proteins in their purified form may not interact with the protein complexed on
a virion.

* Selection using intact virus particles may lead to the identification of
viral components previously unknown.

"The success of isolating numerous anti-RSV RNAs and RNA analogs from a large
pool of random sequences immediately suggests the potential application of
this approach to isolate RNA and nuclease-resistant RNA analogs against other
viruses such as HIV," concluded Pan et al.

This research was supported by Pennsylvania State University Start-up funds;
National Institutes of Health grant CA47482; American Cancer Society grant
FRA427; and funds from the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine.

Education and Prevention
Availability of Condoms in Quebec Secondary Schools a Priority


The health and welfare policy of the Quebec Health and Social Services
Ministry, Canada, stipulates that preventive measures must be strengthened in
order to reduce the incidence of HIV and other STDs.

According to the policy, one priority activity for the health and social
services network is to make condoms accessible to young people in schools.

In order to assess the effectiveness of measures taken to make condoms
accessible in schools, a survey was carried out in May 1994 in 164 Quebec
health centers (CLSCs).  The CLSC survey showed that of 478 Quebec secondary
schools, 192 (40.2 percent) did not make condoms available; 20 schools (4.4
percent) were in the process of doing so and 265 (55.4 percent) did provide
them.

These figures paint a rather positive picture, compared to the United States,
where in 1992 only 8 percent of schools were reported to have adopted a condom
distribution program.  However, the program's effectiveness is still somewhat
limited because of the main method used to distribute the condoms.

The results show that of the 265 schools distributing condoms, 237 (89.4
percent) did so mainly through their health services.  Automatic distributors
were used in 88 (33.2 percent) schools; 12 schools made them available through
teaching staff; and 13 (4.9 percent) used peer-group projects.

Access to health services has certain limits:  the lack of anonymity and
restricted opening hours.  In addition, some health services do distribute
condoms, but only unofficially.  Ensuring access to condoms through the health
services has the advantage of creating a link between students and healthcare
workers, and encourages educational activity.  However, health services staff
are not always present in many schools; they may only be there a few days a
week.  Moreover, some students say they are intimidated and prefer a more
impersonal approach.

Strides have been taken towards making condoms more accessible in schools than
was the case just a few years ago:  88 schools now provide condom distributors
compared to about 40 in 1992.  This method provides real accessibility, since
hours of access are unlimited and it is far more anonymous than the health
services approach.  Some data collected indicate that provision of condom
machines results from a conscious decision by the school authorities, whereas
distribution by health services may be done without official approval.

The CLSC survey shows that in 192 Quebec schools, the main sources of
reluctance to make condoms available were school principals (90 CLSCs),
followed by parents (86 CLSCs), teaching staff (75 CLSCs), school boards (67
CLSCs) and guidance counselors (62 CLSCs).  Pupils are much less frequently
mentioned as being reluctant (30 CLSCs).

As in an American study, school principals also perceive parents to be an
obstacle to introducing sex education.  However, that perception by CLSCs or
school principals is contradicted by several surveys which have shown a high
rate of acceptance for making condoms available to young people.

In April 1991 the central parents' committee of the Montreal Catholic School
Board, Quebec, Canada, carried out a survey of their school committees.  It
showed that 68.8 percent of respondents were in favor of installing condom
distribution machines in secondary schools.  The survey also revealed that
32.5 percent of parents felt that they were the ones who should decide whether
or not the condom distributors should be installed.

When one seeks to understand why there is reluctance to making condoms
available, the factor most often mentioned by CLSCs (40 percent of cases) is
the fear of encouraging young people to have sexual relations.  Next is the
failure to see any need to make condoms available (30.2 percent); then other
means of access because of proximity to a convenience store, pharmacy or CLSC
(27.6 percent) and, finally, a fear of vandalism against distribution machines
(13.6 percent).

The preliminary results of a study conducted by Joanne Otis of the Universite
du Quebec a Montreal indicate that the number of young people who have sexual
relations is no higher in schools which have distributors than in those which
do not.  These results seem to contradict the hypothesis that the presence of
condom distributors would encourage sexual activity.

A recent Swiss study shows that advertising campaigns to promote condom use
have not increased the number of young people having sexual relations nor the
number of partners they have, but rather have increased the use of condoms by
adolescent boys and girls.  These results were recently corroborated by the
World Health Organization (WHO), which analyzed 90 studies to determine the
impact of sex education on school children.

Education and Prevention
Youth Reaching Out to Youth


The following press release was received from Africans in Partnership Against
AIDS, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Africans in Partnership Against AIDS (APAA) is a community-based organization
formed by members of the African community.  APAA provides HIV/AIDS education
in a culturally appropriate manner and supportive environment for people
living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs), their partners, lovers, families and friends.

We believe in the health and dignity of people living with HIV/AIDS and
recognize the difficulties people face when they are infected with HIV.

A Youth Committee, composed entirely of youth between the ages of 14 and 24,
was set up in September 1994.  Adults are not invited to their meetings, but
can be consulted on issues which need clarification or advice.  The youths
want their own space within the agency to address their issues without
interference.

The Youth Outreach Coordinator initiates her outreach to youth with a letter
to parents, requesting the participation of their children.  The coordinator
attends activities at youth groups, cultural gatherings, churches and mosques
to promote the program.

The Youth Committee works closely with other youth agencies and AIDS service
organizations in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, drawing on a wealth of experience
and expertise on HIV/AIDS and African youth.

The youth have found that in order to address HIV/AIDS effectively, other
factors must be considered.  The most frequently discussed topics include:

* Parent/youth relationships - youth want parents to acknowledge that their
children live in Canadian society and to be open towards them;

* Health issues - including sexuality, sexually transmitted diseases, safer
sex, pregnancy and drugs;

* Employment counselling - youths want skills to make wise choices for their
future employment;

* Networking - to meet youth from other communities to learn how they cope
with HIV/AIDS;

* People living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) - youth want to relate compassionately to
PHAs, families and friends.

On August 5, 1995, eight of APAA's youths participated in the Caribana Parade
to promote safer sex messages.  They designed envelopes containing condoms,
condom manuals, referral lists for youth in Toronto, and matchboxes containing
condoms and safer sex messages drawn from current rap music.  Over 10,000
condoms were distributed at that time.

These are some of the safer sex slogans used in the outreach work:

* Using a condom makes a man last longer!!

* Sex ain't nothin' to die for ...

* Enter a storm without a raincoat, you're bound to get wet!

* When a man uses a condom, it shows he respects me as a woman.

Epidemiology (HIV)
Study Reveals Alarming Prevalence of HIV in Young People


One in every 92 men in the age group of 27 through 39 may be infected with
HIV, according to the most precise estimates yet of the pandemic's toll.

Minorities are far and away the hardest hit, with one of every 33 young
African American men estimated to be infected in 1993.  The latest and most
accurate data available is from 1993 and was published in a report in the
December 8, 1995, issue of the journal Science.

Study author, Philip Rosenberg, of the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI)
forecasts a bleak future if this trend continues, suggesting that "the threat
of AIDS may become a rite of passage" for young people.  This latest report
reaffirms the government's warning that AIDS is threatening more and more
young people.

In January 1995, the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
announced that AIDS in 1993 became the number one killer for people in the age
group from 25 through 44.

Rosenberg's study counters the optimism expressed in the government's recent
announcement that AIDS appears to have leveled off, with 40,000 new infections
every year balanced by 40,000 new deaths.  This apparent plateau is really a
disguise for the increased risk facing young Americans.

It is a fact that only young Caucasian men have seen a drop in new infections
in recent years, while the risk has dramatically increased for young
minorities and women.

Cornelius Baker of the National Association of People with AIDS (NAPWA)
underscored the meaning of the most recent report on prevalence of HIV, when
he stated that, "I don't think most people really get it, that (infection) is
a potential for them.  ...  We have to be clear:  Right now ...  if you get
HIV in your twenties, you will die by around forty years old."

Epidemiology (HIV)
WHO Reports 18.5 Million Have HIV


An estimated 18.5 million people worldwide are infected with HIV - a sharply
higher number attributed to better reporting rather a surge in the epidemic,
the United Nations (U.N.)  health agency said.

About six million people are thought to have developed AIDS since the start of
the epidemic in the late 1970s, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.  Of
these, 4.5 million have died.

An estimated 6,000 people are infected each day with HIV; of the 18.5 million
already infected, 1.5 million are children, the agency said.

WHO previously estimated that 1 million children and between 13 million and 15
million adults are infected with HIV and a total of 4.5 million people had
developed the disease.

The agency said the new figures reflected an improvement in estimating
techniques, better HIV prevalence studies and other research, rather than a
sudden jump in new infections.

Two-thirds of the estimated HIV cases and three-quarters of advanced AIDS
cases, are in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO said.

India has the most HIV carriers - an estimated 1.75 million of its one billion
people.  Thailand - another country where experts fear an explosion in cases -
has 700,000 HIV carriers.

The highest proportional HIV rate was in Botswana, with about 18 percent of
sexually active adults infected.  An estimated 17 percent of adults aged 15-49
had the virus in Zambia and Zimbabwe and 15 percent in Uganda.

In the Americas, Haiti had the highest proportion of HIV carriers, at 4.4
percent.  The Bahamas followed at 3.9 percent, with Barbados at 2.8 percent.
In the United States, where an estimated 700,000 people were HIV positive at
the end of 1994, the infection rate was 0.5 percent.

In Europe, Spain had the highest rate of HIV infections, with 0.58 percent of
sexually active adults, followed by Switzerland with 0.2 percent, WHO said.
WHO is forced to rely on estimates to gauge the spread of HIV and AIDS because
actual cases reported by governments give little idea of the true picture,
especially in Africa.

North Korea reports no cases of HIV.

Although WHO estimated the true number of AIDS cases at six million, the
actual number reported by governments was 1.3 million.  The United States
accounted for 39 percent of all the reported cases but only 7 percent of the
estimated cases.

The figures for HIV infections are for the end of 1994, while the AIDS figures
include cases that developed in 1995.  A WHO official said there was a slight
overlap in the two categories.

Industry News (Blood Substitutes)
Hemolink Phase II Trials to Begin in 1996


A red blood cell substitute will go into Phase II clinical trials early in
1996 and, if all goes well, could be available on the market by 1999.

The announcement was made at the 1995 International Chemical Congress of
Pacific Basin Societies, held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 17-22, 1995.

The blood substitute, Hemolink, manufactured by Hemosol, is made of chemically
modified hemoglobin, says Dr.  Gord Adamson, a company scientist.  Hemolink is
derived from screened and tested blood that is outdated because it has been
stored for more than six weeks.

Hemosol takes the expired blood, separates out the red blood cells and
extracts the hemoglobin.  That's more complicated than it sounds.  "A red cell
is not just a package of clean hemoglobin," Adamson says.  "It contains about
90 different proteins."  The company heat-treats the hemoglobin to destroy any
contaminating viruses that may have eluded the screening process conducted by
collection agencies.  Other remaining proteins are then removed by a novel
displacement chromatographic process.

The process strips away blood-group antigens and other proteins, so Hemolink
can be used by all patients regardless of blood type.  And the purification
steps make the likelihood of transmission of diseases such as HIV and
hepatitis "virtually" nil, according to Adamson.

"The reason we say 'virtually,"' he notes, "is because scientifically it is
impossible to prove total absence of a virus," but he is very confident that
Hemolink would pose no threat to users in terms of blood-borne diseases.  In
addition, the blood from which Hemolink is derived is already approved for
use; the company does not accept contaminated units.

After purification, the free hemoglobin is cross-linked with oxidized
raffinose, a sugar molecule.  This "improves the ability of the free
hemoglobin to deliver oxygen to tissue, stabilizes each hemoglobin molecule
and links together several such molecules so that they are large enough to
circulate for extended periods," Adamson says.

Human trials with Hemolink show the blood substitute circulates for a couple
of days in the blood stream - compared with a month or more for transfused red
cells - and is then excreted, says Adamson.  But animal trials show this is
long enough to counteract oxygen shortages during acute blood loss, say, in an
accident or an operation.  In fact, these trials showed that animals treated
with Hemolink did just as well as those treated with transfusions of the
animals' own blood.

Hemosol is currently working with two versions of Hemolink, one a fluid stored
in a refrigerator and one frozen.  Either formulation would be suitable for
surgical applications.  A long-term goal is to develop a freeze-dried
formulation.  It would be light enough to ship to remote depots - for use in
disasters or military conflicts, for example - and it could be reconstituted
with sterile water on-site.

Adamson believes the cost for Hemolink would be competitive, noting that there
are significant administrative costs associated with the existing blood
collection and distribution system.  These include the storage, transport,
disposal and other labor and record-keeping activities that a successful blood
substitute would significantly reduce.  Also, since no cross-matching would be
required, these costs would be saved.

Hemolink also would avoid some of the costly problems associated with blood
transfusions - such as transmission of disease (ranging from HIV or hepatitis
to a bacterial infection), or mismatched blood (where the patient might have a
reaction to antigens in the donor's blood that could be mild, such as a fever,
or severe, resulting in death), or the delays in surgery brought about by
blood shortages.

Hemosol will not rely just on Hemolink to launch itself in this market.  The
company is collaborating with Ronald Kluger, a chemistry professor with the
University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to further extend cross-linking
technologies for second-generation products.

Adamson says the work also is aimed at chemically modifying hemoglobin so it
can serve as a carrier for drug molecules.  Tissues that can accumulate and
metabolize protein-drug conjugates are potential targets.  An example is a
solid tumor.  Adamson says this would reduce many of the side-effects of
anti-tumor agents.

A large-scale conversion from red cells to blood substitutes is unrealistic,
particularly in the short term, Adamson says.  But assuming they win approval,
blood substitutes could ultimately bring in big money.  Industry estimates of
the potential market for blood substitutes (and newer applications where red
cells can't be used) by the year 2002 are around 1.5 million units (worth
US$500 million) in North America, and over three million units worldwide,
Hemosol says.

Industry News (Clinical Trials)
Results Announced for SnET2 To Treat Cancers


PDT Inc.  (PDTI), Santa Barbara, California, announced preliminary Phase I/II
clinical results for its first drug, tin ethyl etiopurpurin (SnET2), for the
treatment of certain skin cancers and AIDS related Kaposi sarcoma (KS).

At a financial conference in New York, New York, Gary S.  Kledzik, Ph.D.,
chairman and chief executive officer, stated:  "In the Phase I/II clinical
trials, photodynamic therapy with SnET2 eliminated or reduced a substantial
number of tumors and demonstrated an excellent safety profile.

"These preliminary results indicate SnET2 is a promising drug for treating
solid tumors, although Phase III studies are needed to provide definitive
data.  Final preparations are under way with our corporate partner, Pharmacia
& Upjohn, for Phase III trials in the U.S.  and Europe."

Photodynamic therapy uses drugs which are activated by light to selectively
destroy diseased cells, such as cancer, with minimal effects on normal
tissues.  The company's first clinical studies with SnET2 involved a combined
Phase I/II study for treatment of certain skin cancers, and a second combined
study for treatment of AIDS related KS.  These studies assessed the safety of
the drug and evaluated the drug and light doses needed to achieve tumor
responses.

The Phase I/II skin cancer study included basal cell carcinomas (skin cancers
caused primarily by sun exposure), basal cell nevus syndrome (a genetic
disease which causes multiple, recurrent basal cell carcinomas), and
metastatic adenocarcinomas (cancers which originate in glands, such as breast
cancer, and in this study have metastasized or spread to the skin).

This skin-cancer study included a total of 46 patients and 418 tumors.  In
Phase I, combinations of drug and light doses were investigated.  The Phase II
portion was conducted at the anticipated optimal drug/light dose.

Evaluable tumor responses were as follows:  100 percent of the basal cell
carcinomas had complete responses (no visible or palpable evidence of tumor
remained).  In basal cell nevus syndrome patients, 95 percent of tumors
responded.  Of the responding tumors, 86 percent were complete responses and
14 percent were partial responses (reduced by 50 percent or more in size).

In metastatic adenocarcinoma patients, 100 percent of tumors responded; 96
percent were complete responses and 4 percent were partial.  This Phase I/II
KS study involved an additional 45 patients with a total of 404 tumors.

Phase I of this study investigated drug and light combinations.  Phase II
studies were conducted using the anticipated optimal drug dose and two
selected light doses.  At the higher light dose, 63 percent of the evaluable
tumors responded.  60 percent of the responding tumors were complete responses
and 40 percent were partial.

The safety of SnET2 was also investigated during these clinical trials.  Side
effects were minimal.  The most common side effect was mild, transient skin
sun sensitivity, which occurred in a small percentage of patients and did not
require treatment.  No clinically significant abnormal trends were noted in
the laboratory parameters.

The company emphasized that these data are interim and that final analyses
have not been concluded.  The primary goal of Phase I/II clinical trials is to
assess safety and dosing parameters.  Phase III studies are required to
determine efficacy.

Industry News (Joint Venture) 
Phase I/II Clinical Trials with Protease Inhibitor for HIV Begins 


Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge, Massachusetts, announced that its
partner Glaxo Wellcome has started Phase I/II clinical trials with VX-478
(141W94), a orally administered protease inhibitor designed for the treatment
of HIV and AIDS.

The multi-center study is being conducted at sites in the United States and
Europe.  This study is part of an international clinical development program
for VX-478 being undertaken by Glaxo Wellcome, Kissei Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd., Matsumoto-City, Japan, and Vertex.

The Phase I/II trial announced is a dose-ranging study designed to test the
antiviral efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VX-478 during four
weeks of drug administration in HIV positive individuals.  The trial will
initially investigate three dose levels:  300 mg twice daily; 300 mg three
times daily and 450 mg twice daily.

Higher doses may be explored based on the tolerability of VX-478 at the
initial doses.  VX-478 has been shown to be well-tolerated in Phase I clinical
studies which evaluated single doses up to 1200 mg.  To assess the anti-HIV
activity of VX-478 at each dose level, the study will monitor CD4 counts and
the viral load of the study participants.

The data from this trial will be used by Glaxo Wellcome and Kissei to design
advanced trials to assess the safety and anti-HIV efficacy of VX-478 alone and
in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

"This Phase I/II trial builds on the strong tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
bioavailability data generated for VX-478 in the Phase I trial completed
earlier [in 1995]," commented Dr.  Joshua Boger, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Vertex.  "This trial marks the beginning of an accelerated effort
to move VX-478 through clinical development."

In July 1995, Glaxo Wellcome reported data from a Phase I trial of VX-478.  In
this study, VX-478 was well-tolerated and displayed excellent pharmacokinetics
at the single doses tested, 150 mg, 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg and 1200 mg.

The amount of VX-478 detected in the blood was directly proportional to the
doses administered.  At eight hours following administration, the level of
VX-478 detected in the bloodstream for each of the doses was well above the
IC[90], the concentration of drug that eliminates 90 percent of HIV
replication in vitro.  The half-life of the compound ranged from approximately
seven to ten hours, and oral bioavailability was calculated at greater than 70
percent.

HIV protease, a viral enzyme required by the virus for replication, is widely
recognized as a promising therapeutic target for treatment of HIV infection
and AIDS.  The HIV protease is an alternative target to reverse transcriptase,
the viral enzyme targeted by drugs such as Retrovir (AZT), Videx (ddI), Hivid
(ddC) and Epivir (3TC).

Industry News (Thalidomide)
Drug Available to AIDS Patients Under Expanded Access Provisions


Celgene Corporation, Warren, New Jersey, reports it has launched a U.S.  Food
and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved program for expanded access to its
thalidomide drug Synovir for AIDS patients suffering from cachexia, a severe
weight loss condition.

Up to now, the drug has been available to the AIDS community only through
unregulated procurement from unknown sources.

Permission to dispense the drug legally to physicians treating AIDS patients
was granted recently by the FDA and was followed in October 1995 by FDA
approval of a request by Celgene to recover costs for supplying the drug and
related clinical expenses.  Both FDA actions are considered unusual for an
experimental compound still in clinical trials.

Celgene said it has begun sending official documents to the first of hundreds
of physicians who have expressed interest in entering patients in the open
label compassionate use protocol.

Under provisions agreed to with the FDA, interested physicians must receive
permission from their affiliated hospitals to enroll patients in the study.
Celgene will then dispense the drug to the physicians.  It is estimated that
roughly 100,000 US AIDS patients suffer from severe weight loss.

Celgene said the cost of Synovir will be about $550 for a 12-week supply.  By
comparison, recombinant human growth hormone, which is available to AIDS
patients under a treatment investigational new drug (IND), is currently priced
at approximately $11,000 for a 12-week supply, according to industry sources.
Synovir's price was established under FDA guidelines and enables Celgene to
recover costs of manufacture, R&D and handling of the expanded access program.

A portion of the Synovir distributed will be provided free of charge to
economically-disenfranchised patients.

The protocol for the expanded access trial of Synovir is complementary to
Celgene's placebo-controlled HIV wasting trial and provides patients who fail
to meet admission criteria of that study access to the drug.

The broad entry criteria, coupled with greater physician access, substantially
increases the availability of Synovir to patients who may benefit from the
therapy, Celgene said.

The expanded access program is open to patients suffering from AIDS related
weight loss including those with coincident opportunistic infections or
malignancies and also to those who have previously failed to respond to other
therapies aimed at treating HIV wasting.  More severely ill patients may
receive Synovir via a salvage arm of the trial.

Weight gain is the primary endpoint.  Patients can continue the therapy after
the initial 12-week treatment period, although informed consent will be
required every six months.

Infection Control
TB and AIDS Programs - Natural Partners or Not?


Can tuberculosis and AIDS prevention and treatment programs be successfully
combined?

The question was debated during a tuberculosis (TB) conference in Paris with
researchers expressing differing views.

D.A.  Enarson of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease
(IUATLD) argued that tuberculosis and AIDS prevention services are less than
compatible, because they target different groups.

"Tuberculosis prevention is a medical services related activity whereas HIV
prevention is a general population activity," Enarson noted.

"Because of the difference in the point of implementation of the two programs,
attempts to combine them are difficult."

Enarson made the remarks at the 1995 annual meeting of the IUATLD Conference
on Global Lung Health, held in Paris, France.

Enarson noted that while the goal of TB and HIV prevention programs is the
same - to prevent infections - the focus must be different.

"In the case of tuberculosis, prevention is based on a strategy of case
management in which infectious cases are found and treated, thereby preventing
transmission from the source (the sick patient)," Enarson noted in an abstract
presented at the conference.  "This is the only means of primary prevention.
Persons with the infection who are not sick almost never transmit the
infection to others.  With HIV infection, transmission occurs from an infected
person who usually has no clinical evidence of the infection.

"Prevention of transmission of this infection is, in general, based on general
health education aimed at behavior modification, Thus, the point of
implementation of the two programs is quite different:  for HIV, the point of
implementation must be the general population of subsets of it."

R.  O'Brien of the World Health Organization's Global Tuberculosis Program
countered that collaboration between AIDS and tuberculosis programs is
essential if services for already-infected persons are to be efficiently
implement.

"Isoniazid preventive therapy for co-infected persons may be highly effective,
but little work on its programmatic application has been undertaken," O'Brien
noted.  "Testing of TB patients for HIV may provide for better patient care
and help reduce HIV transmission, but voluntary testing with counselling is
not widely available."

O'Brien noted that virtually no home-based care programs for AIDS patients
with TB exist, even though these programs may help alleviate the burden on TB
programs and prevent further TB transmission in households.

O'Brien also found efforts to control nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis
to be lacking.

"AIDS and TB programs have unique expertise and orientations which together
can address the problems," he wrote in an abstract presented to the IUATLD
meeting.

"Unfortunately, until now these factors have been used as excuses for working
separately rather than for seeking fruitful collaboration.  However, TB is now
recognized as the most important opportunistic infection and cause of death in
HIV infected persons worldwide.  TB and HIV/AIDS programs can no longer be
permitted to function in isolation and must collaborate to improve care and
preventive services for those suffering from this 'deadly duo'."

The World Health Organization's E.  van Praag agreed that home-care programs
for people with AIDS offer unique opportunities to control tuberculosis in
developing areas.

"Over the last few years initiatives to set up community-based or home care
programs for people and families living with HIV/AIDS have mushroomed
rapidly," van Praag wrote in an abstract of a presentation to the IUATLD
conference.  "In countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS, between 50-100
different home care programs can be identified (Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Thailand).  These initiatives are a response to needs felt by HIV affected
families, communities and health staff in environments where hospitals can
scarcely cope and economic survival and social status of those families have
seriously deteriorated, due to AIDS.

"More than half of the people with HIV related illness will develop
tuberculosis.  Early recognition of tuberculosis and chances to complete
treatment are again hampered by limited collaboration within various health
care programs and by AIDS specific issues such as recurrent illnesses and
reduced income to afford frequent return visits.  Opportunities exist within
home care programs where peripheral health and social staff are in close
contact with patients and family care givers to early recognize TB disease
among HIV infected and affected family members.  Home care staff could provide
drugs, supervise DOT and educate families and communities about HIV and TB
prevention and care.  Projects in Ghana, Zimbabwe and South Africa have
already implemented joint TB and AIDS home care programs."

Researcher D.A.  Enarson is from the IUATLD, Paris, France.  R.  O'Brien and
E.  van Praag are from the Global Tuberculosis Program and the Global Program
on AIDS, World Health Organization, 1211 Geneva 27, Switzerland.

Prophylaxis (TB)
Isoniazid-Based Therapy Useful Despite Hepatotoxicity


Prophylactic isoniazid therapy is beneficial to all patients with pulmonary
fibrotic lesions compatible with previous tuberculosis (TB), despite the risk
of potentially life-threatening complications such as hepatitis, according to
a report from Switzerland.

The report warns, however, that it is still unclear whether the benefits of
such therapy outweigh possible side-effects.

Tuberculosis reactivation is increased among patients with chest X-rays
showing untreated fibrotic lesions suggestive of healed, previous TB
(so-called fibrotic lesions).

"Prophylactic treatment with a six to 12-month course of isoniazid (INH) has
proven effective in these cases, giving about 70 percent protection rate
against reactivation of TB," researcher F.P.  Sarasin and colleagues wrote
("Isoniazid Preventive Therapy for Pulmonary Tuberculosis Sequelae:  Which
Patients Up to Which Age?"  Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:394-400).

"Nonetheless, whether the benefit of isoniazid outweighs it potentially
life-threatening side effects (isoniazid-induced hepatitis) in all age groups,
and in patients with coexisting diseases that limit life expectancy such as
severe chronic heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), a frequent clinical situation, remains unstudied."

Earlier studies have focused on recommendations for prophylactic isoniazid
among patients with positive tuberculin skin test reactions only.  None,
however, has specifically addressed recommendations regarding persons with
fibrotic lesions discovered on chest X-ray.

In this study Sarasin et al.  conducted a Markov-based decision analysis model
which balances the risk of recurrent TB against TB-related mortality,
incidence of isoniazid-related hepatitis, and isoniazid-related death.

They also sought to determine the optimal strategy between a six- to 12-month
course of prophylactic isoniazid and therapeutic abstention in different age
groups and in patients with severe coexisting diseases that limit life
expectancy such as CHF or COPD.

"The core of our decision tree was a model representing the natural history of
untreated patients with pulmonary tuberculosis sequelae," Sarasin et al.
wrote.  "Over time, they may die from different age- or gender-related causes,
or develop early or late TB and die from it.  Whether these patients may
benefit from prophylactic isoniazid involves weighing the trade-offs between
the short term risks of isoniazid-related complications and avoidance of TB
reactivation, a benefit that may be accrued over the short or the long term,
depending on when TB occurs."

The Markov decision analysis found that in all groups of patients,
prophylactic isoniazid clearly reduced the number of deaths from tuberculosis,
whereas very few cases died from isoniazid-related toxicity.  However, because
isoniazid-related deaths occur early, and TB-related deaths can occur early or
late, the gain in life expectancy was small.

"Particularly for patients with short survival such as those older than 80
years and those with CHF or COPD, the average gain in life expectancy provided
by prophylactic isoniazid did not exceed on week," Sarasin et al.  wrote.

"When the gains in life expectancy provided by prophylactic isoniazid are
small and may not be considered clinically relevant, the optimal therapeutic
decision becomes a toss-up.  In clinical practice, toss-ups will undoubted be
interpreted differently by the physicians, the patients, and the health care
planners.  While physicians will focus on the patient's attitude toward risk
(risk-aversion versus risk-seeking profile) and on therapeutic observance,
patients will pay much more attention to the quality of life associated with
isoniazid therapy, and specifically the inconvenience of taking medication,
office visits, and laboratory tests.  On the other hand, from the health
planners' vantage point, the potential epidemiologic benefit of preventing
several future TB cases by treating one patient preventively will be the most
important determinant of decision making."

The authors conclude that the usually recommended six- to 12-month course of
prophylactic isoniazid is beneficial to all cohort age groups.  They added,
however, that recommendations should be modulated for the very elderly and
those with severe disease that limits life expectancy.

"For this subgroup of patients, frequently encountered in daily clinical
practice, the decision whether and for how long to give prophylactic therapy
might reasonably be left to the judgement of the individual patient and the
physician," they wrote.

Therapy
Levofloxacin More Active than Ofloxacin in In Vitro Study


The experimental antituberculosis quinolone levofloxacin showed two- to
four-times more antimicrobial activity than ofloxacin in a newly reported in
vitro study from Japan.

"Levofloxacin showed greater activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv
phagocytosed in macrophages than ofloxacin," researcher H.  Saito and
colleagues wrote ("In Vitro Antimycobacterial Activity of a New Quinolone,
Levofloxacin," Tubercle and Lung Disease, 1995;76:377-380).

Levofloxacin, the optically active L-isomer of ofloxacin, exhibits significant
bactericidal activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase and has a strong antimicrobial
activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

The antimicrobial activity of levofloxacin has been found to be eight to 128
times greater than that of the corresponding D-isomer and approximately twice
as potent as that of ofloxacin.

In earlier studies Saito et al.  reported that some new quinolones including
ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fleroxacin and sparfloxacin possessed appreciable in
vitro and in vivo antimycobacterial activity, especially against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  fortuitum, and M.  leprae.

In this study Saito et al.  examined in vitro antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various pathogenic mycobacteria, in particular M.
tuberculosis and M.  avium complex (MAC).

Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of levofloxacin for various
mycobacterial species were determined by the agar dilution method using 7H11
medium and compared with those of ofloxacin.  Antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis and M.  intracellulare phagocytosed in
murine peritoneal macrophages was measured in terms of reducing
cell-associated bacterial colony forming units (CFUs).

MICs of levofloxacin against M.  tuberculosis, M.  kansasii, M.  marinum, M.
scrofulaceum, M.  avium, M.  intracellulare, M.  fortuitum, and M.  chelonae
were two to four times lower than those of ofloxacin.  Levofloxacin exhibited
higher efficacy in reducing bacterial CFUs in macrophages than ofloxacin.

"The present results showed that in vitro antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various mycobacteria was two to four times greater than
that of ofloxacin, in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration values," Saito
et al.  wrote.

Previous investigators have reported that the antimicrobial activity of
levofloxacin against various bacteria other than mycobacteria is generally
twice that of ofloxacin (Hayakawa et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemother
1986;29:163-164; Imamura et al., Antimicrob Agents and Chemo 1987;31:325-327
and Tanka et al., J Antimicrob Chemother 1990;26:659-666).

"The difference in in vitro activity of levofloxacin from ofloxacin in these
reports is therefore consistent with that in the present study," Saito et al.
wrote.  "In the case of M.  intracellulare, significant delay of bacterial
growth was caused by levofloxacin added at 1 mg/L, but such efficacy was not
observed for ofloxacin at the same concentration.  Levofloxacin and ofloxacin
at doses of 10 mg/L prevented the bacterial growth during the whole incubation
period.  There were significant differences between these two quinolones in
the efficacy in reducing the intra-macrophage growth of M.  intracellulare."

Microbiology and Immunology, Shimane Medical University, Izumo 693, Japan.

Transmission
New Policy Cautions HIV Infected Women on Breastfeeding


To prevent the spread of HIV to newborns, the American Academy of Pediatrics
(AAP) recommends that HIV infected women shouldn't breastfeed or donate
breastmilk to milk banks.  Despite the numerous health benefits of
breastfeeding to infants, the potential for HIV infection through human milk
exists, according to a new AAP policy.

Among the recommendations, the Academy recommends all women seeking prenatal
care should be counseled about the risk of HIV transmission and should be
offered voluntary HIV testing.  The academy's recommendations are intended for
the U.S., where infectious diseases and malnutrition are not major causes of
infant death and where safe alternatives to breastfeeding are available.

In cases where HIV infection is known not to be present, the Academy continues
to strongly promote breastfeeding as the optimal form of infant nutrition.

Xenotransplantation
Baboon BMT Experiment a Reality


Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Structured
Biologicals Inc.  (SBI), Toronto, Ontario, Canada, announced that an SBI
sponsored experiment consisting of a bone-marrow transplant from a baboon to
an AIDS patient took place at a San Francisco, California, hospital.

On July 14, 1995, an advisory panel to the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) unanimously recommended that one AIDS patient be allowed to receive an
experimental bone-marrow transplant from a baboon.  Collaborators on the
experiment include Dr.  Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S.  National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Dr.  Robert Gallo, a pioneering
AIDS researcher at the U.S.  National Cancer Institute (NCI).

Avi Ben-Abraham, M.D., also a lecturer in surgery at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, took part in the procedure.

The experiment was devised by Dr.  Suzanne Ildstadt, Chief, Division of
Cellular Therapeutics, Pittsburgh University School of Medicine.  Ildstadt
discovered a novel blood cell, the "facilitating" cell, which eliminates the
risk of graft-versus-host disease, a fatal adverse reaction, and successfully
fights transplant rejection.

Baboons are naturally resistant to HIV-1.  It is therefore believed that the
uninfected baboon bone marrow cells will join the HIV infected human marrow to
restore the patient's immune function.

The applied "facilitating" cell technology may dramatically change the
practice of transplantation in that it could potentially enable permanent
acceptance of transplanted organs such as heart, kidney, lung and liver as
well as transplanted cells or tissue, all without the need for tissue matching
or prolonged administration of immunosuppressive drugs.

The technology could provide effective treatments for blood and autoimmune
diseases, such as:  Leukemia and Lymphoma, Sickle Cell Anemia, Thalassemia,
Systemic Lupus Euythematosis, Crohn's Disease and Type 1 Diabetes, and may
ultimately permit successful xenotransplantation (cross-species
transplantation).

Positive Patients."  P.M.  Boiselle, I.  Tocino, R.J.  Hooley, A.S.

Pumerantz, P.A.  Selwyn and V.P.  Neklesa, et al.  New Haven, Connecticut.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To assess the accuracy of
chest radiographic interpretation in the diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia (BP), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in
HIV-positive patients and to identify the frequency with which these
infections mimic each other radiographically.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The
admitting chest radiographs of 153 HIV-positive patients with laboratory
proved BP (n=71), PCP (n=73) and pulmonary TB (n=9) and those of 10 HIV
positive patients with no active disease were reviewed retrospectively and
independently by 3 radiologists.  Readers were blinded to clinical
presentation, CD4 count, original radiographic interpretation, and final
diagnosis.  For each case, the radiologists listed a single diagnosis followed
by an assessment of degree of confidence.  RESULTS:  A confident diagnosis was
made in 136 of 163 cases (83.4%).  By specific diagnostic category, the median
accuracies are as follows:  pulmonary TB, 85%; PCP, 75%; BP, 64%; and no
active disease, 100%.  Correcting for random agreement, there was moderate
interobserver agreement.  Fifteen of 153 cases (9.8%) mimicked other
infections radiographically and were given the same inaccurate diagnosis by
all 3 independent observers.  CONCLUSION:  Chest radiographic interpretation
allows a confident and accurate diagnosis to be made in the majority of HIV
positive patients with PCP, BP, and TB at the time of hospitalization.  In
approximately 10% of cases, these infections may mimic each other
radiographically."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  To illustrate the
difficulty in establishing the diagnosis of esophageal lymphoma in patients
with AIDS and concomitant viral infection.  MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Esophageal
lymphoma or possible esophageal lymphoma was diagnosed in 8 AIDS patients over
a 4-year period.  Six patients underwent esophagography, in addition to
endoscopy and biopsy.  Four patients underwent repeated biopsies.  No patients
underwent immunologic marker studies.  RESULTS:  Only 1 patient had a polypoid
mass in the distal esophagus typical of neoplasm.  The other 7 patients had
esophageal ulcers that radiologically and at gross inspection endoscopically
were considered of viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV] or idiopathic) origin.
Pathologic examination initially suggested lymphoma in all 7 patients with
concomitant CMV in 5.  Follow-up biopsies revealed that the 'lymphomatous'
infiltrate was actually inflammatory reaction in 3.  In 1 patient, an isolated
CMV inclusion was discovered on the 2nd biopsy, and the esophageal ulcer
resolved with ganciclovir despite continued pathologic evidence of lymphoma.
CONCLUSION:  Esophageal lymphoma and viral infection coexist such that there
can be considerable diagnostic and thereby therapeutic confusion in regard to
these patients.  In patients with radiologically benign viral ulcers, repeat
biopsy or marker studies of pathologically 'lymphomatous' lesions are in
order."

Immunology (TB)
"Regulation of the Human Cellular Immune Response in Tuberculosis."  J.J.
Ellner.  Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Pulmonary tuberculosis is characterized by activation of local and systemic
immune and inflammatory cells and mediators.  Somewhat paradoxically, delayed
type hypersensitivity responses to tuberculin purified protein derivative, and
in vitro correlates frequently are depressed in patients with tuberculosis.
Cross-modulatory cytokines, produced by mononuclear phagocytes, chiefly
transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-(beta)), deactivate effector function,
depress T-cell activation and may account for depressed delayed-type
hypersensitivity (DTH) and increased antibody levels.  Ingestion of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis by mononuclear phagocytes stimulates expression of
cytokines.  Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-(alpha)) and TGF-(beta) function
in autocrine circuits producing activating and deactivating signals,
respectively, for macrophage effector function.  Lipoarabinomannen (LAM) from
virulent M.  tuberculosis selectively induces expression of TFG-(beta)
relative to TFG-(alpha) by monocytes.  In patients with tuberculosis,
TFG-(beta) is expressed in granulomas, and blood monocytes show increased
spontaneous and tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated
production of this cytokine.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to TFG-(beta)
reverses depressed PPD-stimulated blastogenesis and interferon-gamma
expression.  Therefore, TFG-(beta) seems a key mediator of immunosuppression
and energy.  Moreover, neutralizing antibody to interleukin-10 partly restores
PPD-stimulated blastogenesis.  Parallel with depressed T-cell responses,
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis show increased levels of IgM, IgG, IgG-1,
and IgE antibodies directed against M.  tuberculosis.  This finding too may
reflect cross-regulation by TFG-(beta).  Current understanding of
immunoregulation in tuberculosis provides some clear directions for
immunotherapy.  In dually-infected persons, activation of CD4 lymphocytes and
monocytes by tuberculosis might promote replication of HIV-1.  In fact, serum
and cell-derived TNF-(alpha) are increased in HIV infected tuberculosis
patients and this cytokine is known to stimulate HIV replication.  Further,
monocytes from patients with tuberculosis show increased infectability by HIV;
and PPD and M.  tuberculosis stimulate HIV replication in latently infected
macrophages.  Therefore, M.  tuberculosis and HIV infections may be mutually
enhancing.  The human immune response can be used to identify candidates for a
subunit vaccine.  Increasing evidence supports a primary role for
extracellular products of M.  tuberculosis as a target of protective immunity.
Epitope mapping of the secreted 30 kD alpha-antigen indicates immunodominance
of certain peptides that could provide the basis for an improved vaccine or
DTH skin test."

Infection Control (TB)
"Behavioral Factors in Tuberculosis Control."  E.  Sumartojo.  Division of
Tuberculosis Elimination, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, Georgia.


According to an abstract submitted by the author to The Lancet Conference 'The
Challenge of Tuberculosis', held September 14-15, 1995, in Washington, D.C.,
"Tuberculosis control is directed towards ensuring that patients complete
treatment without infecting others.  Relevant Behavioral and social factors
concern the decisions and actions of individuals who influence treatment
outcomes, including persons at risk for disease, tuberculosis patients, and
health care providers.  Relevant issues include health education for patients
and for the public, provider knowledge and practice, the unique needs of HIV
infected persons and others at high risk of tuberculosis, and the quality of
treatment and control services.  Poor medication adherence remains the core
Behavioral problem in tuberculosis control.  Supervised or directly observed
therapy (DOT) is a currently accepted solution but it is not a panacea; where
successful, it is part of an array of other services.  Continuing social and
Behavioral research describes factors associated with adherence.  Ethnographic
research has addressed the knowledge and beliefs of individuals about
tuberculosis.  Findings are that individuals from various cultures associate
tuberculosis with stigmatization and rejection, have concerns about the
appropriateness and quality of health care, and are often misinformed about
the cause and treatment of the disease.  Studies of interventions show the
effectiveness of community health workers, family and community support, and
comprehensive services that include strong case management, efficient clinic
practices, and additional social or health services for patients.  Research is
emerging on communication strategies used by providers as they talk to
patients, and the impact of poor communication on patient behavior.  Studies
of treatment practices show that some physicians use inadequate regimens, with
implications for the education and supervision of physicians who treat
tuberculosis.  In the next few years, research will emphasize development of
locally appropriate and effective treatment services.  Behavioral research
must focus in intervention studies, informed by findings from existing
descriptive research, but also incorporating social and Behavioral theory and
research methods, and epidemiological research methods.  Critical issues will
be identifying the best mix of services for specific regions and types of
patients, improving provider communication strategies and provider practices,
and ensuring that persons with high likelihood of exposure or HIV infection
seek screening and complete preventive therapy or treatment for tuberculosis."

Therapy (Kaposi Sarcoma)
"Radiation Therapy of the Oral Cavity and Oropharynx In Patients with AIDS
Related Kaposi Sarcoma."  L.Z.  Nisce, M.  Coleman and T.P.  Kaulmann.  New
York, New York.


According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 81st Scientific
Assembly of the Radiological Society of North America, held November 26 -
December 1, 1995, in Chicago, Illinois, "PURPOSE:  The well-documented
phenomenon of exaggerated mucosal toxicity in patients with AIDS treated with
radiation therapy has generally precluded the use of this modality in patients
with Kaposi sarcoma involving the head and neck.  A study to evaluate the
feasibility of radiation therapy with an intensive oral care and radiation
planning technique was assessed at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center from 1991 to 1995.  CONCLUSION:  Numerous reports discourage the use of
radiation therapy in this group of patients.  Our preliminary results
demonstrate that radiation therapy is feasible and can markedly improve their
quality of life."

Presentations of Lymphoma in Human Immunodeficiency Virus Disease:

Predominance of T-Cell Lineage."  Archives of Dermatology, November
1995;131(11):1281-1288.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Archives of
Dermatology, "BACKGROUND AND DESIGN:  Most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in patients
with human immunodeficiency virus infection are of B-cell lineage.  Cutaneous
lymphoma in the human immunodeficiency virus disease has not been
systematically reviewed.  We studied 25 patients with both human
immunodeficiency virus infection and cutaneous presentations of lymphoma,
using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus.
RESULTS:  Two groups of patients were discerned:  (1) those with conditions
similar to mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome with an indolent course (n=8)
and (2) those with nodules or papules, greater immunosuppression, a rapid
clinical course, and large cell lymphoma seen on biopsy specimens (n=17).  The
epidermotropic lymphomas were of T-cell lineage and CD30(-).  Thirteen of the
large cell lymphomas were also of the T-cell type, and 71% were CD30(+).
Epstein-Barr virus was absent in the epidermotropic lymphomas, but it was
present in 73% of the nonepidermotropic cases.  CONCLUSIONS:  Two forms of
human immunodeficiency virus-associated cutaneous lymphoma were found:
indolent disease resembling mycosis fungoides or Sezary syndrome and large
cell lymphomas with a poor prognosis, whose cells often had a CD30(+) T-cell
phenotype and harbored the Epstein-Barr virus."  The corresponding author for

Immune Responses Induced by Secretion of a Chimeric Soluble Protein from a
Recombinant Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Vector Candidate
Vaccine for Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 in Small Animals."
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of
America, November 7, 1995;92(23):10693-10697.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, "A
recombinant Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vector-based
vaccine that secretes the V3 principal neutralizing epitope of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could induce immune response to the epitope and
prevent the viral infection.  By using the Japanese consensus sequence of
HIV-1, we successfully constructed chimeric protein secretion vectors by
selecting an appropriate insertion site of a carrier protein and established
the principal neutralizing determinant (PND)-peptide secretion system in BCG.
The recombinant BCG (rBCG)-inoculated guinea pigs were initially screened by
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reactions to the PND peptide,
followed by passive transfer of the DTH by the systemic route.  Further,
immunization of mice with the rBCG resulted in induction of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes.  The guinea pig immune antisera showed elevated titers to the PND
peptide and neutralized HIVMN, and administration of serum IgG from the
vaccinated guinea pigs was effective in completely blocking the HIV infection
in thymus/liver transplanted severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)/hu or
SCID/PBL mice.  In addition, the immune serum IgG was shown to neutralize
primary field isolates of HIV that match the neutralizing sequence motif by a
peripheral blood mononuclear fell-based virus neutralization assay.  The data
support the idea that the antigen-secreting rBCG system can be used as a tool
for development of HIV vaccines."  The corresponding author for this study is:

Hodgkin's Disease
Siebert, J.D.; Ambinder, R.F.; Napoli, V.M.; Quintanillamartinez, L.; Banks,
P.M.; Gulley, M.L.  "Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Associated Hodgkin's Disease
Contains Latent, Not Replicative, Epstein-Barr Virus."  Human Pathology,

November 1995;26(11):1191-1195.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Human Pathology,
"Severe immunodeficiency is associated with reactivation of latent
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) that is manifested by virus replication.  It is
unknown whether EBV replication also occurs in the Hodgkin's disease (HD)
tissue of patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Therefore, we studied paraffin-embedded lymph nodes from 13 cases of
HIV-associated HD to determine the latent or replicative state of EBV
infection.  All patients were seropositive HIV-infected men; additional
clinical information was available for 12 patients.  The risk factor(s) for
HIV infection were homosexuality (n=7), intravenous drug abuse (n=2),
homosexuality and intravenous drug abuse (n=1), sexual promiscuity (n=1), or
hemophilia (n=1).  Advanced clinical stage and B symptoms were common at the
time of initial diagnosis of HD.  The histological subtype of Hodgkin's
disease was universally mixed cellularity, except for a single case classified
as nodular sclerosis.  Seven cases exhibited foci of relative lymphoid
depletion.  Five cases contained foci of necrosis.  Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells
and RS cell variants were positive for CD30/BerH2 and negative for CD45/LCA
CD45RO/UCHL1, and CD20/L26 in all cases.  Tumor cells were positive for
CD15/LeuM1 in seven cases.  In all 13 cases, RS cells and RS cell variants
were infected by latent EBV as shown by in situ hybridization to EBV-encoded
ribonucleic acid (EBER1).  In 12 of 13 cases neoplastic cells coexpressed EBV
latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1).  EBV replication was examined by two
different methods:  immunohistochemistry to identify EBV-encoded BZLF1 protein
and in situ hybridization to detect EBV BHLF1 transcripts.  No positivity in
RS or RS cell variants was detected with either assay of EBV replication (95%
confidence interval [CI]=0% to 23%).  The findings confirm that EBV is
detected more frequently in HIV-associated HD when compared with
immunocompetent patients with HD.  The findings also suggest that EBV is
tightly latent within RS and RS cell variants of HIV-associated HD.  It
appears that factors other than host immune status are important in
maintaining EBV latency in HIV-associated HD."  The corresponding author for

Immunotherapy

Retroviral Disease:  Influence of Major Histocompatibility Complex Type and
T-Cell Responsiveness."  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of

the United States of America, November 7, 1995;92(23):10492-10495.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,
"Administration of virus-specific antibodies is known to be an effective early
treatment for some viral infections.  Such immunotherapy probably acts by
antibody-mediated neutralization of viral infectivity and is often thought to
function independently of T-cell-mediated immune responses.  In the present
experiments, we studied passive antibody therapy using Friend murine leukemia
virus complex as a model for an immunosuppressive retroviral disease in adult
mice.  The results showed that antibody therapy could induce recovery from a
well-established retroviral infection.  However, the success of therapy was
dependent on the presence of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes.  Thus,
cell-mediated responses were required for recovery from infection even in the
presence of therapeutic levels of antibody.  The major histocompatibility type
of the mice was also an important factor determining the relative success of
antibody therapy in this system, but it was less critical for low-dose than
for high-dose infections.  Our results imply that limited T-cell
responsiveness as dictated by major histocompatibility genes and/or stage of
disease may have contributed to previous immunotherapy failures in AIDS
patients.  Possible strategies to improve the efficacy of future therapies are
discussed."  The corresponding author for this study is:  KJ Hasenkrug, Niaid,

Knowledge, Attitudes and Behavior
Steele, A.; Melby, V.  "Nurses' Knowledge and Beliefs about AIDS:  Comparing
Nurses in Hospital, Community and Hospice Settings."  Journal of Advanced
Nursing, November 1995;22(5):879-887.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Advanced Nursing, "The literature reports an ongoing debate amongst nurses
regarding the risk of contracting human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) through
routine nursing care.  An emotionally charged dilemma appears to exist for
many nurses regarding what they perceive as conflict between professional
obligation and personal risk.  This study investigates nurses' beliefs,
knowledge and perceptions of risk of contracting HIV while implementing their
nursing care.  The study focuses on qualified nurses in the hospice, hospital
and community settings.  No other similar comparative study that also focuses
on hospice nurses has been identified.  This quantitative study was
implemented within Northern Ireland, by way of a respondent-administered
questionnaire.  The study's sample consisted of 45 qualified nurses and a
response rate of 93% (42 respondents) was achieved.  Analysis of the data
involved the use of descriptive and correlational statistics.  Overall
findings indicated that many nurses, but particularly those who work in the
hospital and community settings, hold negative and biased beliefs, and have
inadequate knowledge and misguided perceptions regarding their risk of
contracting HIV through the implementation of routine nursing care of clients.
Many of those nurses readily admit their lack of knowledge.  On the whole,
hospice nurses appear more knowledgeable and exhibit a more positive approach
to AIDS clients, and appear less fearful than do nurses in the other two
settings.  Implications for hospital management, for nurse education, for
nurses themselves and for clients are discussed.  This study should be seen as
a springboard for future research within Northern Ireland."  The corresponding

Study:  Clinical and Immunological Characteristics of HIV 1-Infected Pregnant
Women."  British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, November

1995;102(11):869-875.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in British Journal
of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, "OBJECTIVE:  To describe the changing clinical
and immunological characteristics and timing of diagnosis of HIV-infected
pregnant women enrolled in the European Collaborative Study.  DESIGN:  A
prospective study of the mothers of children enrolled in the European
Collaborative Study on children born to HIV-infected women.  SETTING:
Twenty-one European centres in seven countries.  SUBJECTS:  One thousand six
hundred and ninety HIV-infected women and their 1754 deliveries.  RESULTS:
The proportion of women in whom HIV infection had been diagnosed before
pregnancy increased significantly over time, from 7% in 1984-1985 to 65% in
1994 (P<0.001).  The prevalence of breastfeeding, which was related to the
timing of diagnosis, significantly declined over the study period.  The mean
CD4 count was 510 cells/mm(3), and there was a significant decline in average
CD4 count over the study period.  Black women had a significantly lower CD4
count than white women.  From survival analysis it is estimated that five
years after delivery, 14% of women will have died and 24% will have developed
CDC stage IV disease.  CONCLUSIONS:  Timing of diagnosis is of critical
importance if mother-to-child transmission is to be reduced through avoidance
of breastfeeding and zidovudine therapy and effective antenatal screening
policies have become increasingly important.  The rate of progression of
maternal disease highlights the implications of HIV infection for their
children, both infected and uninfected."  The corresponding author for this

Infection."  Archives of Ophthalmology, November 1995;113(11):1401-1409.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Archives of
Ophthalmology, "OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 1000-and
5000-centistoke silicone oil as retinal tamponades for the treatment of
retinal detachments secondary to necrotizing retinitis in patients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  DESIGN:  A prospective observational
study.  SETTING:  Community and university-based ophthalmology clinics.
PATIENTS:  Three hundred fifty patients with HIV infection, who had 407 eyes
with retinal detachments secondary to necrotizing retinitis.  INTERVENTION:
Vitrectomy surgery for retinal detachment with 1000- or 5000-centistoke
silicone oil as the retinal tamponade.  OUTCOME MEASURES:  Efficacy was
measured both by anatomic success (defined as complete retinal attachment or
macular attachment) and by visual acuity success (defined as preservation of
visual acuity or ambulatory vision).  Safety was determined by the rate of
complications, including abnormal intraocular pressure and corneal and lens
opacification.  RESULTS:  At the last follow-up examination, the retina was
completely attached in 287 (73%) of 393 eyes, the macula was attached in 370
eyes (94%), 268 eyes (68%) had ambulatory vision, and visual acuity was
preserved in 219 (56%) of 388 eyes.  Corneal opacification, hypotony, and
silicone oil emulsification were present in 4%, 2%, and 1% of eyes,
respectively.  One eye had elevated intraocular pressure.  Of the 57 patients
who had both eyes treated, 35 died, of whom four (11%) had nonambulatory
vision in both eyes.  Of the 293 patients who had one eye treated, 122 died,
of whom 44 (36%) died with nonambulatory vision in the treated eye.  The
median time to cataract was 192 days; to nonambulatory vision, 474 days; and
to death, 204 days.  CONCLUSIONS:  Silicone oil repair of retinal detachments
in necrotizing retinitis is an efficacious and safe procedure that delays or
prevents loss of vision in advanced HIV disease."  The corresponding author

Delivery System - Importance of Autologous Alpha 2-Macroglobulin in the
Development of Peptide Vaccine."  Biochemical and Biophysical Research

Communications, November 2, 1995;216(1):399-405.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Biochemical and
Biophysical Research Communications, "We have hijacked a process of the
receptor-mediated endocytosis to transport peptide antigens into antigen
presenting cells (APCs) for the purpose of increasing the level of antigen
presentation (named Receptor-Linked Antigen Delivery System (R-LADS)).  By
coupling an endogenous plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha
2M) to a synthetic peptide having a partial sequence of HIV-1 envelope
protein, alpha 2M was made to carry the peptide into APCs as a part of the
normal alpha 2M cycle, which resulted in an increased production of specific
antibodies against the peptide (Mitsuda, S., Nakagawa, T., Osada, T.,
Shimamoto, T., Nakazato, H.  and Ikai, A.  (1993) Biochem.  Biophys.  Res.
Commun.  194, 1155-1160).  We demonstrate here that this procedure becomes a
more efficient tool for antibody production when autologous transporter
protein was used.  By using murine alpha 2M (m alpha 2M) instead of
heterologous human alpha 2M (h alpha 2M) when mice were experimental animals,
we were able to dramatically enhance the production level of anti-HIV-1
peptide antibodies and shorten the period which is needed for antibody
production.  We aim to develop effective peptide vaccines by further improving
this system."  The corresponding author for this study is:  S Mitsuda, Tokyo

F.F.; Drummond, M.  "Cost Effectiveness of Antituberculosis Interventions."
Pharmacoeconomics, November 1995;8(5):385-399.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in
Pharmacoeconomics, "The treatment of tuberculosis (TB) is ranked as the most
cost effective of all therapeutic programmes in terms of cost per year of life
saved.  Nevertheless, TB kills or debilitates more adults aged between 15 and
59 years than any other disease in the world; furthermore, about 2 to 4% of
the burden of disease, 7% of all deaths and 26% of all preventable deaths are
directly attributable to TB.  About one-third of the world's population is
infected with the TB bacillus.  In the developing world, more women of
childbearing age die from TB than from causes directly associated with
pregnancy and childbirth.  The death of adults in their prime, who are
parents, community leaders and producers in most societies, causes a
particularly onerous burden besides being a serious public health problem.  In
the poorest countries, where the magnitude of the TB problem is greatest,
those TB control strategies that are economically feasible tend to be less
effective.  Therefore, in low and middle income countries, cost-effectiveness
considerations aimed at prioritizing resource allocation in the health sector
in general, and in TB control programmes in particular, are of paramount
importance.  Operationally, the main components of a TB control programme are:
(i) detection and treatment of TB; and (ii) prevention of TB through BCG
vaccination and chemoprophylaxis.  Priority should be given to ensuring that
TB patients complete their prescribed course of chemotherapy.  Adequate
treatment is the most effective way of preventing the spread of TB and the
emergence of drug resistance.  This article reviews evidence of the
effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different approaches to TB can,
particularly those that are applicable to low income countries, in both
HIV-infected and noninfected patients.  Financial implications and ways to
implement directly observed therapy for TB in large urban areas are discussed,
and the need to address some relevant operational issues is highlighted.  The
current role of chemoprophylaxis and BCG vaccination is also reviewed."  The

Critically III Patients with Pneumocystis carinii Pneumonia."  American
Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November
1995;152(5):1435-1442.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "The objective of the present study
was to assess the association between type of health insurance coverage and
use of diagnostic tests and therapies among patients with AIDS-related
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).  Fifty-six private, public, and
community hospitals in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Miami were selected for the
study, and the charts of 890 patients with empirically treated or
cytologically confirmed PCP, hospitalized during 1987 to 1990 were
retrospectively reviewed.  Patients were classified by insurance status:
self-pay (n=56), Medicaid (n=254), or private insurance, including health
maintenance organizations and Medicare (n=580).  Primary outcomes were the use
and timing of bronchoscopy, the type and timing of PCP therapy, and
in-hospital mortality.  The results indicate that Medicaid patients were less
likely than privately insured patients to undergo bronchoscopy (relative odds
= 0.61; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.93; P=0.02) or to have their diagnosis of PCP
confirmed (relative odds = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.33, 0.77), after adjusting for
patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.  Medicaid patients
were approximately three-fourths more likely than privately insured patients
(relative odds = 1.73; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.96; P=0.04) to die in-hospital, after
adjusting for patient, severity of illness, and hospital characteristics.
However, with further adjustment for confirmation of PCP, Medicaid patients no
longer had a significantly higher likelihood of dying in-hospital.  We
conclude that Medicaid patients are less likely to receive diagnostic
bronchoscopy than privately insured or self-insured patients, more likely to
be empirically treated for PCP, and more likely to die in-hospital.  Higher
mortality among Medicaid patients may result from failure to diagnose and
treat alternative pathogens, a consequence of worse access to invasive
diagnostic tests."  The corresponding author for this study is:  CL Bennett,

Fauvel, M.  "HIV Infection among Women Undergoing Abortion in Montreal.."
Canadian Medical Association Journal, November 1, 1995;153(9):1271-1279.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Canadian Medical
Association Journal, "OBJECTIVE:  To determine the seroprevalence and
correlates of HIV infection in a subpopulation of women of childbearing age in
Montreal.  DESIGN:  Anonymous unlinked seroprevalence study.  SETTING:
Pregnancy termination unit in a teaching hospital in Montreal.  PARTICIPANTS:
Women presenting for abortion from July 1989 to June 1993 who resided in
Quebec and were not known to have HIV infection, 12017 (99.6%) of 12068
eligible women were included in the study.  INTERVENTION:  HIV antibody
testing of serum left over from samples obtained for routine Rh typing, the
same algorithm as for serodiagnostic testing, namely enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
followed by confirmatory testing of repeatedly EIA-reactive samples, was used.
OUTCOME MEASURES:  HIV serostatus by age, marital status, region of residence
(metropolitan Montreal Versus other), country of birth and number of living
children.  RESULTS:  Most (84.7%) of the subjects resided in metropolitan
Montreal.  The median age was 27.0 (range 13 to 50) years.  The serum samples
of 22 women were confirmed to be HIV positive, for an overall seroprevalence
rate of 1.8 per 1000 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8).  The seroprevalence
rate did not vary significantly by age, marital status, region of residence or
study year.  However, it was strongly correlated with country of birth:
Canada 0.16, Haiti 23.5, HIV-endemic countries other than Haiti 5.3 and
non-HIV-endemic countries other than Canada 0.0 per 1000.  The seroprevalence
rate among women born in Haiti was 147 times higher than that among women born
in Canada (P<0.0001).  Of the women born in Haiti the rate was 3.0 times
greater among those who immigrated to Canada in 1985 or later than among those
who immigrated earlier (P=0.047).  CONCLUSIONS:  The results of this study
indicate that the HIV seroprevalence rate among women in Montreal is strongly
associated with country of birth, women born in HIV-endemic countries,
especially Haiti, having the highest rate.  These results will help in the
development of policies regarding HIV antibody testing and prevention of HIV
transmission in Quebec."  The corresponding author for this study is:  RS

"Clinical and Chest Radiographic Features of Tuberculosis Associated with
Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Zimbabwe."  American Journal of Respiratory

and Critical Care Medicine, November 1995;152(5):1558-1561.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "In the developing world, the
diagnosis of tuberculosis is dependent on clinical and radiologic features as
culture facilities are not readily available.  It has been reported that
tuberculosis in HIV-positive persons can present with atypical clinical and
radiographic features.  The object of this study was to examine how often
atypical features occur in HIV-positive compared with HIV-negative persons and
how these findings correspond to sputum-smear findings.  Detailed demographic,
clinical, and chest radiographic features of tuberculosis were assessed in 202
HIV-positive adults and 220 HIV-negative patients admitted consecutively.
Using univariate analysis, several of these features were found to be
significantly associated with being HIV-positive, but after multiple
regression analysis only, age group (15 to 42 yr), a negative tuberculin
response, intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, and lack of cavitation but not
sputum-smear status remained significant."  The corresponding author for this

Therapy (Hepatotoxicity)
Vandenbrande, P.; Vansteenbergen, W.; Vervoort, G.; Demedts, M.  "Aging and
Hepatotoxicity of Isoniazid and Rifampin in Pulmonary Tuberculosis."  American
Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, November

1995;152(5):1705-1708.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "We evaluated whether elderly
patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and without apparent preexisting liver
disease are at an increased risk to develop hepatotoxicity from an
isoniazid-rifampin regimen and require regular liver function tests in
comparison with younger patients.  We analyzed the data of 131 patients
treated in the period 1980-1985 of whom 64 (49%) were at least 60 yr of age.
Subsequent increases of transaminases (measured weekly for as long as 4 wk
after the start of treatment and later on when symptoms suggestive of
hepatotoxicity occurred) above baseline values were found more frequently in
the elderly (38 versus 18%, P<0.05) and were also more pronounced in them
(P<0.01).  The ratio of the highest transaminase value over the baseline value
was called the transaminase index (TI).  A TI of at least 5 was found in 22%
of elderly and 8% of younger patients (P=NS), but ratios as high as 10 were
mostly asymptomatic and always normalized progressively without treatment
adjustment.  Only symptomatic patients with a TI greater than or equal to 10
(five elderly and three younger) required temporary or definitive treatment
adjustment.  We conclude that repeated liver function test evaluations are
generally unnecessary, except for symptomatic elderly and younger patients
alike, in order to detect those with a TI greater than or equal to 10, thus
requiring drug adjustment."  The corresponding author for this study is:  M

Felton, C.P.  "Hepatotoxicity from Isoniazid and Rifampin in Inner-City AIDS
Patients."  American Journal of Gastroenterology, November

1995;90(11):1978-1980.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Gastroenterology, "OBJECTIVE:  To determine the incidence of hepatotoxicity
due to isoniazid and rifampin in inner-city patients with active tuberculosis.
DESIGN:  A hospital-based review of 70 consecutive in-patients in a 770-bed,
inner-city hospital.  The patient population is primarily African-American and
Hispanic.  METHODS:  Fifty-eight men and 12 women were followed from 2-12 wk
(median 4 wk).  Patients had to be treated for at least 2 wk to be eligible
for the study.  Patients were excluded if they had been on any
anti-tuberculous or any other hepatotoxic drug during the 2-month period
before their hospitalization.  Aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase,
bilirubin, and albumin were obtained at least every 2 wk.  RESULTS:
Hepatocellular toxicity, defined as AST and/or ALT greater than 200 IU/L,
occurred in eight out of 70 (11.4%) patients.  The mean age of these patients
was 38.9 yr (22-58 yr).  Patients with AIDS were significantly more likely to
develop hepatotoxicity than those with any other risk factor (P<0.01).
CONCLUSIONS:  Baseline aminotransferases followed by monitoring may be
necessary in AIDS patients."  The corresponding author for this study is:  LA

Toxoplasma gondii
Kasper, L.H.; Matsuura, T.; Khan, I.A.  "IL-7 Stimulates Protective Immunity
in Mice Against the Intracellular Pathogen, Toxoplasma gondii."  Journal of
Immunology, November 15, 1995;155(10):4798-4804.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Immunology, "Cytokines, in particular IFN-gamma and IL-12, are important in
host protection against infection with Toxoplasma gondii.  This parasite is a
major cause of congenital infection and morbidity in immunosuppressed persons,
especially those with AIDS.  IL-7, a monomeric protein produced by bone marrow
stromal cells and fetal thymus, is able to induce the proliferation of pro-B
cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and to enhance cytotoxicity of CTL and NK
cells, Inbred mice were infected with a lethal dose of T.  gondii and given
IL-7 twice daily.  Mice treated with IL-7 beginning at the time of infection
survived, whereas mice either treated after infection or not treated died.
Phenotypic analysis of splenocytes identified an expansion of NK (asialo
GM1(+)) cells and CD8(+) T-cell populations.  In vivo depletion of NK (asialo
GM1(+)) and CD8(+) T cells showed that cells expressing these phenotypes were
important for maintaining protection against the parasite.  IFN-gamma
depletion resulted in complete reversal of the protective effect of IL-7
administration.  In vivo depletion of endogenous IL-7 enhanced susceptibility
to infection.  Cytokine analysis by semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR
showed that IL-7 enhances the IFN-gamma response and furthermore reverses the
parasite-mediated down-regulatory response on IL-2.  These observations
indicate that exogenous administration of human rIL-7 is able to protect mice
against acute parasite challenge by stimulating IFN-gamma production and
augmenting the CD8(+) T cell-mediated CTL response."  The corresponding author

Virology
Huang, Y.X.; Zhang, L.Q.; Ho, D.D.  "Biological Characterization of Nef in
Long-Term Survivors of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Infection."
Journal of Virology, December 1995;69(12):8142-8146.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Virology, "We have previously shown that there were no gross deletions or
obvious sequence abnormalities within nef of human immunodeficiency virus type
1 (HIV-1) in the 10 long-term survivors studied (Y.  Huang, L.  Zhang, and
D.D, Ho, J, Virol, 69:93-100, 1995).  Here we extend our study to examine
these nef alleles in a functional context.  Using a new technique, termed
site-directed gene replacement, we have precisely replaced the nef of an
infectious molecular clone, HIV-1(HXB2), with nef alleles derived from 10
long-term survivors as well as from a patient with AIDS.  The replication
properties of these chimeric viruses demonstrated that the nef alleles derived
from long-term survivors neither significantly increased nor decreased viral
replication, compared with the nef allele of Nef(+) HIV-1(HXB2) and that
derived from a patient with AIDS.  However, Nef(+) viruses always replicated
faster than virus lacking nef.  Moreover, single-cell infection analysis by
the MAGI assay showed that these chimeric viruses, as well as Nef(+)
HIV-1(HXB2), were more infectious than Nef(-) HIV-1(HXB2) was, Therefore, we
conclude that the genotypic and phenotypic features of nef are not likely to
account for the nonprogression of HIV-1 infection in the 10 cases studied,
unless the function of the nef gene in vivo is not accurately reflected by the
in vitro assays we used."  The corresponding author for this study is:  DD Ho,
