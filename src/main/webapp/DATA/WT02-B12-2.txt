from Telecom, partial text of CPSR press rreleease on NII <p>

Palo Alto, Calif., October 25, 1993 -- In the wake of sudden corporate
mergers and rapid technological developments, Computer Professionals
for Social Responsibility (CPSR) today voiced concern that the planned
information superhighway will not realize its full potential.  The
public interest organization put forward specific guidelines for the
National Information Infrastructure (NII) in a paper titled, "Serving
the Community: A Public-Interest Vision of the National Information
Infrastructure."  Urging the Clinton Administration to move quickly to
adopt these principles, CPSR President Eric Roberts said, "Although
there is widespread agreement on general goals, there is no specific
plan to ensure that these goals are met." <p>

"It is much easier to state a vision than to achieve it, " said Dr.
Roberts, who is also Associate Chair of the Computer Science
department at Stanford University.  "And there are many dangers on the
horizon that threaten to compromise the value of the NII as a resource
for the public. <p>

"For example, if a small number of companies dominate the market,
we're in danger of stifling competition and innovation on the network.
If those same companies control the programming, then open and diverse
speech is limited.  If pricing structures do not cover universal
service, the average person and the poor will be struggling to use the
backroads of the information highway.  If privacy isn't protected,
your TV could keep more detailed records of your finances than the
IRS.  And, if the NII is not designed to allow everyone to communicate
freely and to publish their own contributions, it could become nothing
more than a medium for delivering 500-channel television, with
interactivity limited to home-shopping and trying to guess the next
play during sporting events." <p>

CPSR's paper expands on these dangers and makes specific policy and
technical recommendations for the newly formed Information
Infrastructure Task Force.  The Task Force is expected to coordinate
network policy for the Clinton Administration. <p>

"In its 'Agenda for Action' document, the Administration has set forth
a positive vision of what the NII can be," said Dr. Roberts.  "To
achieve that vision, however, the government must play a major role in
the design, development, and regulation of the network."  CPSR recommends
that the Administration adopt the following policies: <p>

o   Promote widespread economic benefits by evaluating the NII's
    economic success using measures that reflect its impact on the
    society as a whole, not merely the profits of NII investors and
    service providers. <p>

o   Evaluate the social impact of the NII by conducting periodic
    reviews as the NII is implemented and used to guarantee that it
   continues to serve the public interest. <p>

o   Guarantee equitable and universal access through an appropriate
    mix of legislation, regulation, taxation, and direct subsidies. <p>

o   Promote the development of a vital civic sector by ensuring
    resources, training, and support for public spaces within the NII
    where citizens can pursue noncommercial activities. <p>

o   Promote a diverse and competitive marketplace in terms of the
    content carried over the NII. <p>

o   Provide access to government services and information over the
    NII. <p>

o   Encourage democratic participation by ensuring full public
    disclosure, and actively promoting democratic decision-making
    and public participation in all stages of the development process. <p>

o   Actively facilitate the seamless connection of America's NII with
    the information infrastructures of other nations by working to
    resolve such issues as security, censorship, tariffs, and privacy. <p>

o   Guarantee the functional integrity of the NII by establishing
    critical technical requirements including ease of use, widespread
    availability, full functionality, high reliability, adequate privacy
    protection, and evolutionary expansion. <p>
