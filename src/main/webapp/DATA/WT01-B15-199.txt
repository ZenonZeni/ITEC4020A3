<P>
Sec. 141. (a) Findings. The Congress finds that
<P>
(1) long-term storage of high-level radioactive waste or spent
nuclear fuel in monitored retrievable storage facilities is an
option for providing safe and reliable management of such waste
or spent fuel;
<P>
(2) the executive branch and the Congress should proceed as expeditiously
as possible to consider fully a proposal for construction of one
or more monitored retrievable storage facilities to provide such
long-term storage;
<P>
(3) the Federal Government has the responsibility to ensure that
site-specific designs for such facilities are available as provided
in this section;
<P>
(4) the generators and owners of the high-level radioactive waste
and spent nuclear fuel to be stored in such facilities have the
responsibility to pay the costs of the long-term storage of such
waste and spent fuel; and
<P>
(5) disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear
fuel in a repository developed under this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101
et seq.] should proceed regardless of any construction of a monitored
retrievable storage facility pursuant to this section.
<P>
(b) Submission of proposal by Secretary.
<P>
(1) On or before June 1, 1985, the Secretary shall complete a
detailed study of the need for and feasibility of, and shall submit
to the Congress a proposal for, the construction of one or more
monitored retrievable storage facilities for high-level radioactive
waste and spent nuclear fuel. Each such facility shall be designed
<P>
(A) to accommodate spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive
waste resulting from civilian nuclear activities;
<P>
(B) to permit continuous monitoring, management, and maintenance
of such spent fuel and waste for the foreseeable future;
<P>
(C) to provide for the ready retrieval of such spent fuel and
waste for further processing or disposal; and
<P>
(D) to safely store such spent fuel and waste as long as may be
necessary by maintaining such facility through appropriate means,
including any required replacement of such facility.
<P>
(2) Such proposal shall include
<P>
(A) the establishment of a Federal program for the siting, development,
construction, and operation of facilities capable of safely storing
high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel, which facilities
are to be licensed by the Commission;
<P>
(B) a plan for the funding of the construction and operation of
such facilities, which plan shall provide that the costs of such
activities shall be borne by the generators and owners of the
high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel to be stored
in such facilities;
<P>
(C) site-specific designs, specifications, and cost estimates
sufficient to (i) solicit bids for the construction of the first
such facility; (ii) support congressional authorization of the
construction of such facility; and (iii) enable completion and
operation of such facility as soon as practicable following congressional
authorization of such facility; and
<P>
(D) a plan for integrating facilities constructed pursuant to
this section with other storage and disposal facilities authorized
in this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq.].
<P>
(3) In formulating such proposal, the Secretary shall consult
with the Commission and the Administrator, and shall submit their

an environmental assessment with respect to such proposal. Such
environmental assessment shall be based upon available information
regarding alternative technologies for the storage of spent nuclear
fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The Secretary shall submit
such environmental assessment to the Congress at the time such
proposal is submitted.
<P>
(2) If the Congress by law, after review of the proposal submitted
by the Secretary under subsection (b), specifically authorizes
construction of a monitored retrievable storage facility, the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969
[42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] shall apply with respect to construction
of such facility, except that any environmental impact statement
prepared with respect to such facility shall not be required to
consider the need for such facility or any alternative to the
design criteria for such facility set forth in subsection (b)(1).
