	Moby Dick, A Tale of Two Cities, Don Quixote. These are classic works of literature that today two out of every three high school students do not even recognize. <P>

Okay, so three out of three. <P>

	Of course, that's not so bad though when you realize that none of them can identify where Canada is, either. <P>

	To idealistic Richard Clark, however, everyone in school has the deep-rooted ability to be a top student and there's no such thing as a bad kid. That's why he's quit his job teaching at a posh academy and moved to a tough inner city high school. It's his strongest belief that these kids should be allowed to have the very same experiences that all people have in high school dating, going to proms and begging for sex. <P>

	Jon Lovitz stars in High School High, which also stars Tia Carrere, Mekhi Phifer and Louise Fletcher. <P>

	High School High tells the rose-coloured adventures of Richard Clark (Lovitz), who leaves the safe world of Wellington School, where his father is the respected headmaster, and travels into the otherworldly territory of a ghetto school so tough it has its own cemetery. There, his innocent, hopeful spirit charms -- and bewilders -- one school official, Victoria Chappell (Carrere), while at the same time seriously rankles the realistic high school principal (Fletcher) at every conceivable turn. In his efforts, Clark sees a beacon of hope in Griff McReynolds (Phifer), a tough kid with a surprising, hidden dream.  <P>
