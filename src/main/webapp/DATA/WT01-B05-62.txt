<p>The Administration has released, and is seeking informal
comments on, a draft of the new Commerce Department regulations on
encryption exports. </p>

<p>The new regulations create a new category of controls --
&quot;EI&quot; (which stands for &quot;encryption items&quot;). The regulations
divide these encryption items into 5 categories and create
different licensing schemes for each. </p>

<p>Certain mass-market encryption software may be released, after
a one-time review, from normal EI controls and made eligible for
mass market treatment (which includes eligibility for all the
provisions of the Export Administration Regulations applicable to
other software).</p>

<p>&quot;Recovery&quot; encryption software and equipment will be
eligible for a license to export and reexport in unlimited
quantities to all non-embargoed destinations. Applications for
key recovery and key escrow products must identify a satisfactory
key recovery agent with established security policies adequate to safeguard
keys or other escrowed material.</p>

<p>56-bit DES or equivalent non-recovery encryption items will be
eligible for 6-month export and reexport licenses after an initial
review of the item and the submission of a satisfactory key
recovery plan demonstrating a commitment to develop key recovery
products and services. Licenses can be renewed for additional six
month periods depending upon the applicant's adherence to
benchmarks set out in the original plan. All licenses issued
under this category will expire after December 31, 1998.</p>

<p>All other encryption items may be eligible for
&quot;encryption licensing arrangements.&quot; These arrangements are
like the distribution arrangements currently available for
encryption items at the State Department. Such arrangements may
allow exports and reexports of encryption software and equipment
in unlimited quantities to all non-embargoed destinations, but
applications must specify the sales territory and classes of
end-uers. Such arrangements may also impose certain reporting
requirements. Encryption items not approved for an encryption
licensing arrangement may still be granted individual licenses on
a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Encryption &quot;technology&quot; (e.g. technical data) may be
licensed for export and reexport on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>As expected, the usual Commerce Department rules on foreign
availability and de minimis content will not apply to encryption items.
Similarly, controlled software will not be eligible for
&quot;publicly available&quot; treatment, even if the source code
or object code is published in a book or other media.</p>

<p>Other notable provisions of the new regulations include a
&quot;grandfather&quot; provision for existing State Department
licenses and arrangements; detailed rules concerning Internet
distribution of encryption software; and a broad definition of
&quot;recoverable&quot; encryption which includes items that
allow access to unencrypted data without necessarily requiring
access to the keys. </p>

<p><b>ACTION: </b>Interim rule. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY:</b> This interim rule amends the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) by exercising jurisdiction over,
and imposing new combined national security and foreign policy
controls on certain encryption items that were on the United States
Munitions List, consistent with Executive Order 13026 and a
Presidential Memorandum, both issued by President Clinton on
November 15, 1996. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>On October 1, 1996, the Administration announced a plan to
make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products
to protect their privacy, intellectual property and other
valuable information. The plan envisions a worldwide key management
infrastructure with the use of key recovery and key escrow
encryption items to promote electronic commerce and secure communications
while protecting national security and public safety. To provide
for a transition period for the development of this key
management infrastructure, this rule permits the export and
reexport of 56-bit key length DES or equivalent encryption items
upon issuance by BXA of an initial license valid for six months,
if an exporter makes satisfactory commitments to build and market
recoverable encryption items and to help build the supporting
international infrastructure. This policy will apply to hardware
and software. <br wp="br1">

<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>On November 15, 1996, the President issued a Memorandum
directing that all encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions
List, except those specifically designed, developed, configured, adapted,
or modified for military applications, be transferred to the
Commerce Control List. The Memorandum and Executive Order 13026
(15 November 1996, 61 FR 58767) also set forth certain additional
provisions with respect to controls on such encryption items to
be imposed by the Department of Commerce. The Executive Order
also provides for appropriate controls on the export and foreign dissemination
of encryption items controlled on the U.S. Munitions List that
are placed on the Commerce Control List. In issuing the
Memorandum the President stated: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can
jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests. Moreover,
such products, when used by international criminal organizations, can
threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here and abroad, as well as
the safety of the citizens of other countries. The exportation of
encryption products must be controlled to further U.S. foreign
policy objectives, and promote our national security, including
the protection of the safety of U.S. citizens abroad. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This initiative will make it easier for Americans to use
stronger encryption items to protect their privacy, intellectual
property and other valuable information. It will support the
growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of the
global information infrastructure, and sustain the economic competitiveness
of U.S. encryption product manufacturers during the transition to
a key management infrastructure. Under this initiative,
non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent
strength will be permitted for export and reexport after a
one-time review of the item and if the exporter makes satisfactory
commitments to build and market recoverable encryption items and
to support an international key management infrastructure. This
policy will apply to hardware and software. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The relaxation of export and reexport controls on
non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length DES or equivalent
strength will last until January 1, 1999. The temporary
relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption policy
initiative designed to promote electronic information security and public
safety. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The initiative carries out important foreign policy and
national security concerns identified by the President. Export
controls on cryptographic items are essential to controlling the
spread aborad of powerful encryption products which could be
harmful to critical U.S. national security, foreign policy and law
enforcement interests. This initiative will preserve such
controls and foster the development of a key management
infrastructure necessary to protect important national security,
foreign policy and law enforcement concerns. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule implements the Administration's policy on
encryption exports. This rule amends the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) by imposing national security and foreign policy controls (&quot;EI&quot; for
Encryption Items) on certain information security systems and
equipment, cryptographic devices, software and components
specifically designed or modified therefor, including recoverable encryption software,
and related technology (&quot;encryption items&quot;).
&quot;Encryption items&quot; do not include encryption items specifically
designed, developed, configured, adapted or modified for military applications
(including command, control and intelligence applications). Such
items remain on the U.S. Munitions List, and continue to be
controlled by the Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls.
EI controls apply to encryption software, including recoverable
encryption &quot;software&quot; transferred from the U.S. Munitions
List to the Commerce Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 of November
15, 1996 (61 FR 58767). </p>

<p>This interim rule also amends the Export Administration
Regulations to require a license for exports and reexports to all destinations,
except Canada, of certain encryption items controlled for EI
reasons. The licensing policy is as follows: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<dl>
    <dd>(1) <u>Certain mass-market encryption software</u>.
        Certain encryption software that was transferred from the
        U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List pursuant
        to E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996 (61 FR 58767) may be released
        from &quot;EI&quot; controls and thereby made eligible
        for mass market treatment after a one-time BXA review. To determine
        eligibility for mass market treatment, exporters must
        submit a classification request to BXA. 40-bit mass market encryption
        software may be eligible for a 7-day review process, and
        company proprietary software may be eligible for 15-day
        processing. See new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 of the EAR
        and 748.3(b)(3) of the EAR for additional information.
        Note that the one-time review is for a determination to
        release encryption software in object code only.
        Exporters requesting release of the source code should
        refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No. 6 to
        part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines
        that the software is released from EI controls, such software
        is eligible for all provisions of the EAR applicable to
        other software, such as License Exception TSU for mass-market
        software. If BXA determines that the software is not
        released from EI controls, a license is required for export
        and reexport to all destinations, except Canada, and
        license applications will be considered on a case-by-case basis. <br
        wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        <p>(2) <u>Recovery encryption software and commodities</u>.
        Recovery encryption software and equipment controlled for
        EI reasons under ECCN 5D002 or under ECCN 5A002,
        including encryption equipment designed or modified to
        use recoverable encryption software, may be released from
        &quot;EI&quot; controls and thereby made eligible for
        license exception RSE after a one-time BXA review.
        License exception RSE is valid for all destinations
        except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and
        Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit a classification request
        to BXA. Requests for key escrow and key recovery
        encryption items will receive favorable consideration
        provided that, prior to the export or reexport, a key
        recovery agent satisfactory to BXA has been identified
        (refer to new Supplement No. 4 to part 742) and security policies
        for safeguarding the key(s) or other escrowed
        material/information as described in new Supplement No. 5
        to part 742 are established to the satisfaction of BXA
        and are maintained after export or reexport as required
        by the EAR and any license conditions. If the exporter or reexporter
        intends to be the key recovery agent, then the exporter
        or reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a key
        recovery agent identified in Supplement 5 to part 742. In
        addition, the key recovery or key escrow system must meet
        the criteria identified in Supplement No. 4 to part 742.
        Note that eligibility is dependent on continued
        fulfilment of the requirements of a key recovery agent
        identified in Supplement 5. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        </p>
        <p>(3) <u>Non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit key
        length DES or equivalent strength supported by a
        satisfactory business and marketing plan for exporting
        recoverable items and services</u>. License applications
        from manufacturers of non-recovery encryption items up to 56-bit
        key length DES or equivalent strength will be approved
        for export and reexport by the Department of Commerce
        upon the issuance of an export license valid for six
        months after an initial BXA review of the item and the
        submission of a satisfactory business and marketing plan that
        explains in detail the steps the applicant will take
        during the two-year transition period beginning January
        1, 1997 to develop, produce, or market encryption items
        and services with recoverable features. Any subsequent
        renewal is not automatic, and will depend on the applicant's
        adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set
        forth in the plan submitted for the initial license
        application. This relaxation of controls will last until
        January 1, 1999. The plan that is submitted with applications for
        the export of non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit
        key length DES or equivalent strength must include the
        elements in new Supplement No. 7 to part 742. Note that
        BXA will accept requests for export and reexport of
        non-recoverable encryption items up to 56-bit key length
        DES or equivalent strength under this paragraph from distributors,
        re-sellers, and other entities that are not manufacturers
        of the encryption items. BXA will authorize exports and reexports
        of such items only in instances where a license has been
        granted to the manufacturer of the encryption items. The
        authority to so export or reexport will be for a time
        period ending on the same day the producer's authority to
        export or reexport ends. <br wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">

            <dd>(i) <u>Encryption licensing arrangement</u>. This
                arrangement is intended to continue without change
                the regulatory treatment of the distribution and
                warehouse arrangements currently permitted under
                the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
                Applicants may submit license applications for
                exports and reexports of certain encryption commodities
                and software in unlimited quantities for all
                destinations except Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya,
                North Korea, Syria, and Sudan. Applications will
                be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Encryption
                licensing arrangements may be approved with
                extended validity periods specified by the
                applicant in block #24 on Form BXA-748P. In
                addition, the applicant must specify the sales
                territory and classes of end-users. Such licenses may
                require the license holder to report to BXA
                certain information such as item description,
                quantity, value, and end-user name and address. <br
                wp="br1">
                <br wp="br2">
                <p>(ii) <u>Applications for encryption items not
                authorized under an encryption licensing arrangement</u>.
                Applications for the export and reexport of all
                other encryption items will be considered on a
                case-by-case basis. <br wp="br1">

        Applications for the export and reexport of encryption technology
        will be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that all &quot;EI&quot; encryption items are not subject
to any mandatory decontrol or licensing requirements based on
foreign availability provisions of the EAA or the EAR In section
1(a) of Executive Order 13026, the President states: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>I have determined that the export of encryption products
    described in this section may harm national security and
    foreign policy interests even where comparable products are or
    appear to be available from sources outside the United
    states, and that facts and questions concerning the foreign
    availability of such encryption products cannot be subject to
    public disclosure or judicial review without revealing or
    implicating classified information that could harm United
    States national security and foreign policy interests. Accordingly,
    section 4(c) and 6(h)(2) - (4) of the Export Administration
    Act of 1979 (&quot;the EAA&quot;) ..., all other analogous
    provisions the EAA relating to foreign availability, and the
    regulations in the EAR relating to such EAA provisions, shall not
    be applicable with respect to export controls on such
    encryption products. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This interim rule amends part 768 of the EAR, Foreign
Availability, to make clear that the provisions of that part do
not apply to encryption items transferred to the Commerce Control
List. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to exclude
encryption items transferred from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce
Control List pursuant to E.O. 13026 (61 FR 58767, November 15, 1996)
from the <u>de minimis</u> provisions for items exported from
abroad. This rule also amends part 734 of the EAR to reflect that
certain encryption software controlled for EI reasons under ECCN
5D002 that has been transferred to the Department of Commerce
from the Department of State by E.O. 13026 will be subject to the
EAR even when publicly available. Such encryption software in
both source code and object code remains subject to the EAR and
is not eligible for publicly available treatment even if published
in a book or any other writing or media. This rule also amends
part 740 and Supplement No. 2 to part 774 of the EAR to reflect
that encryption software will not be eligible for &quot;mass
market&quot; treatment under the General Software Note or for
export as beta-test software under License Exception BETA unless
released from EI controls through a one-time BXA review (refer to new
Supplement No. 6 to part 742). Note that License Exception TMP is
available for temporary exports and reexports of encryption items
except under the provisions for beta-test software. Software and
technology that was controlled by the Department of Commerce prior
to [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE] are not affected by this rule and will
continue to be eligible for the publicly available treatment.
Software controlled by the Department of Commerce prior to [INSERT EFFECTIVE
DATE] will continue to be eligible for mass market treatment
under the General Software Note, and License Exception TSU for
mass-market software. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>For purposes of this rule, &quot;recovery encryption
products&quot; refer to encryption products (including software)
which allow law enforcement officials to obtain under proper
legal authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the
user, the plaintext of encrypted data and communications. Such recoverable
products fulfill the objectives of the Administration's encryption
policy. Other approaches to access and recovery may be defined in
the future. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule also amends part 742 of the EAR to reflect
the new combined national security and foreign policy controls imposed
by this rule, and adds a new Supplement No. 4 to part 742 titled
&quot;Key Recovery or Key Escrow Products Criteria&quot; that
includes product criteria, a new Supplement No. 5 to part 742
titled &quot;Key Recovery or Key Escrow Agent Criteria&quot; that includes
interim requirements for key recovery agents, a new Supplement
No. 6 to part 742 titled &quot;Guidelines for Submitting a Classification Request
for a Mass Market Software Product that contains Encryption&quot;
that includes the criteria for the one-time review of
classification requests for release of certain encryption
software from EI controls, and a new Supplement No. 7 to part 742
titled &quot;Review Criteria for Exporter Key Recovery or Key Escrow
Development Plans.&quot; <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This interim rule makes conforming changes in part 748 of the
EAR for classification requests, amends part 750 of the EAR to
reflect the Department of Justice role in the review of
encryption license applications, amends the record keeping provisions
of part 762 of the EAR, adds new definitions to part 772 of the
EAR, and amends the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 to
part 774) by adding new EI controls under ECCNs 5A002, 5D002, and
5E002 for commodities, software and technology that are placed
under Commerce Department jurisdiction by E.O. 13026. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>In certain cases, semiannual reporting requirements on
quantities shipped and country of destination will be imposed on exporters,
in order to allow the United States to fulfill the reporting
requirements of the Wassenaar Arrangement. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The scope of controls on the release to foreign nationals of
technology and software subject to the EAR may be amended in a separate
Federal Register Notice. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This rule involves no new curtailment of exports, because the
transfer or removal of items from the United States Munitions List
to the CCL maintains a continuity of controls. Therefore, the
provisions regarding the impact of new controls do not apply, and
contract sanctity also does not apply to this imposition of
controls. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>U.S. persons holding valid USML licenses and other approvals
issued by the Department of State prior to (INSERT DATE OF
PUBLICATION) may ship remaining balances authorized by such licenses
or approvals under the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers
Export Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs,
citing this Federal Register Notice and the State Department license
number. Such shipments shall be in accordance with the terms and
conditions, including the expiration date, existing at the time
of issuance of the State license. Any reports required for distribution
and other types of agreements previously authorized by the
Department of State, valid at the time of this publication, should
be henceforth submitted to the Department of Commerce. Export violations,
including the terms and conditions of export, shall hereafter constitute
a violation of the EAR. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Consistent with the provisions of section 6 of the Export
Administration Act, a foreign policy report was submitted to Congress
on (<u>DATE OF REPORT</u>), notifying the Congress of the
Department's intention to impose controls on certain information
security systems and equipment, cryptographic devices, software
and components specifically designed or modified therefor, and
related technology that will be controlled on the CCL and that
will be subject to new control procedures. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Although the Export Administration Act (EAA) expired on August
20, 1994, the President invoked the International Emergency
Economic Powers Act and continued in effect, to the extent
permitted by law, the provisions of the EAA and the EAR in
Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, notice of August 15,
1995 (60 FR 42767), and notice of August 14, 1996 </p>

</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1. This interim rule has been determined to be significant
    for purposes of E. O. 12866. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>2. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person
    is required to respond to, nor shall any person be subject to
    a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information,
    subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act,
    unless that collection of information displays a currently
    valid OMB Control Number. This rule involves collections of
    information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
    3501 <u>et seq.</u>). These collections have been approved by
    the Office of Management and Budget under control number
    0694-0088. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism
    implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
    assessment under Executive Order 12612. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
    <p>4. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5
    U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the
    opportunity for public participation, and a delay in effective date,
    are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military
    and foreign affairs function of the United States (Sec. 5
    U.S.C. 553(a)(1)). Further, no other law requires that a
    notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public
    comment be given for this interim final rule. Because a
    notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment
    are not required to be given for this rule under 5 U.S.C. or
    by any other law, the requirements of the Regulatory
    Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <u>et seq.</u> ) are not
    applicable. <br wp="br1">
    <br wp="br2">
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, because of the importance of the issues raised by
these regulations, this rule is issued in interim form and
comments will be considered in the development of final
regulations. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested
persons who wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible
time to permit the fullest consideration of their views. <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The period for submission of comments will close (<u>INSERT
DATE 45 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION</u>). The Department will
consider all comments received before the close of the comment
period in developing final regulations. Comments received after
the end of the comment period will be considered if possible, but
their consideration cannot be assured. The Department will not
accept public comments accompanied by a request that a part or
all of the material be treated confidentially because of its
business proprietary nature or for any other reason. The
Department will return such comments and materials to the person
submitting the comments and will not consider them in the development
of final regulations. All public comments on these regulations
will be a matter of public record and will be available for
public inspection and copying. In the interest of accuracy and completeness,
the Department requires comments in written form. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which
will also be a matter of public record and will be available for public
review and copying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government
or foreign governments will not be made available for public
inspection. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>The public record concerning these regulations will be
maintained in the Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information
Records Inspection Facility, Room 4525, Department of Commerce,
14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.
20230. Records in this facility, including written public
comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oral communications,
may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulations
published in Part 4 of Title 15 of the Code of Federal
Regulations. Information about the inspection and copying of
records at the facility may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo,
Bureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Officer,
at the above address or by calling (202) 482-5653. <br wp="br1">

        the State Department, U.S. persons holding valid USML
        licenses and other approvals issued by the Department of
        State prior [INSERT EFFECTIVE DATE] may ship remaining
        balances authorized by such licenses or approvals under
        the authority of the EAR by filing Shippers Export
        Declarations (SEDs) with District Directors of Customs,
        citing this Federal Register Notice and the State Department
        license number. Such shipments shall be in accordance
        with the terms and conditions, including the expiration
        date, existing at the time of issuance of the State license.
        Violations of such authorizations, terms and conditions constitute
        violations of the EAR. Any reports required for distribution

                Certain encryption software that was transferred from
                the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control
                List pursuant to E.O. 13026 of November 15, 1996
                (61 FR 58767) may be released from &quot;EI&quot;
                controls and thereby made eligible for mass
                market treatment after a one-time review. To
                determine eligibility for mass market treatment,
                exporters must submit a classification request to BXA.
                40-bit mass market encryption software may be
                eligible for a 7-day review process, and company proprietary software
                may be eligible for 15-day processing. Refer to
                new Supplement No. 6 to part 742 of the EAR and
                748.3(b)(2) of the EAR for additional information.
                Note that the one-time review is for a determination
                to release encryption software in object code
                only unless otherwise specifically requested. Exporters
                requesting release of the source code should
                refer to paragraph (b)(3)(v)(E) of Supplement No.
                6 to part 742. If, after a one-time review, BXA determines
                that the software is released from EI controls,
                such software is eligible for all provisions of
                the EAR applicable to other software, such as
                License Exception TSU for mass-market software.
                If BXA determines that the software is not
                released from EI controls, a license is required
                for export and reexport to all destinations,
                except Canada, and license applications will be considered on
                a case-by-case basis. <br wp="br1">

                designed or modified to use recoverable encryption
                software, may be released from &quot;EI&quot; controls
                and thereby made eligible for license exception
                RSE after a one-time BXA review. License

                Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria and
                Sudan. To determine eligibility, exporters must submit
                a classification request to BXA. Requests for
                recoverable products which allow law enforcement
                officials to obtain, under proper legal authority

                and key recovery encryption items which will
                receive favorable consideration provided that,
                prior to the export or reexport, a key recovery
                agent satisfactory to BXA has been identified
                (refer to new Supplement No. 4 to part 742) and
                security policies for safeguarding the key(s) or
                other escrowed material/information as described
                in new Supplement No. 5 to part 742 are established
                to the satisfaction of BXA and are maintained after export
                or reexport as required by the EAR and any license
                conditions. If the exporter or reexporter intends to
                be the key recovery agent, then the exporter or
                reexporter must meet all of the requirements of a
                key recovery agent identified in Supplement 5 to
                part 742. In addition, the key recovery or key
                escrow system must meet the criteria identified
                in Supplement No. 4 to part 742. Note that
                eligibility is dependent on continued fulfilment
                of the requirements of a key recovery agent
                identified in Supplement 4. <br wp="br1">

<p>KEY RECOVERY AGENT REQUIREMENTS; SECURITY POLICIES; KEY
RECOVERY OR KEY ESCROW PROCEDURES <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>This Supplement sets forth criteria that the Department of
Commerce will use to approve key recovery agents to support approval
of the export or reexport of key recovery encryption items
controlled for EI reasons under ECCNs 5A002 and 5D002. Any
arrangements between the exporter or reexporter and the key
recovery agent must reflect the provisions contained in this
Supplement in a manner satisfactory to BXA and other agencies.
This Supplement outlines the criteria for employing key recovery
agent personnel for key recovery procedures. An applicant for a
license to export or reexport key recovery items shall provide,
or cause the proposed key recovery agent to provide, to BXA
sufficient information concerning any proposed key recovery agent
arrangements to permit BXA's evaluation, in conjunction with
other agencies, of the key recovery agent's security policies,
key recovery procedures, and suitability and trustworthiness to
maintain the confidentiality of the key(s) or other escrowed material/information.
The key recovery agent, who must be approved by BXA, may be the applicant
for the export or reexport license or another party legally
obligated to the applicant to provide escrow services. BXA
retains the right, in addition to any other remedies, to revoke
export or reexport licenses if BXA, in conjunction with other
agencies, determines that a key recovery agent no longer meets
these criteria. The requirements related to the suitability and
trustworthiness, security policies, and key recovery procedures
of the key recovery agent shall be made terms and conditions of
the export or reexport license for key recovery items. BXA shall
require the key recovery agent to provide a representation that
it will comply with such terms and conditions. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><u>Key Recovery Agent Requirements</u> <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">

identify to BXA by name, date and place of birth, and social security
number any new individual(s) who will assume the responsibilities
set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this Supplement. Before that
individual(s) assumes such responsibilities, the key recovery
agent must certify to BXA that the individual(s) meets the
criteria set forth in subparagraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this
Supplement. BXA, in conjunction with other agencies, reserves the
right to determine at any time the suitability and
trustworthiness of such personnel. <br wp="br1">

<p>SUPPLEMENT NO. 7 TO PART 742 - REVIEW CRITERIA FOR EXPORTER
KEY RECOVERY OR KEY ESCROW DEVELOPMENT PLANS <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>1. In exchange for specific commitments from exporters to help
build and support a global key management infrastructure (through
development, production and marketing of recovery products and services),
we will permit these companies to export non-recoverable
encryption items with 56-bit key length DES, or equivalent,
encryption items as we now permit the export of certain mass
market encryption software (i.e. rapid review, flexible
licensing) for a maximum of two years. Companies' commitments
should be in the form of a letter from senior corporate
management (i.e. an officer of the company) confirming the
corporate commitment and providing (in the letter or in
attachments) the information specified below. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>2. Issuance of an initial export license valid for six months
will be based on an initial BXA review in conjunction with other government
agencies, and the submission to and approval by BXA (after appropriate
interagency review) of a plan that explains in detail the steps
the applicant will take to develop, produce or market recoverable
encryption products or services. Proposed recovery products and
services will be evaluated against technical criteria which are
found in Supplement No. 4 to this part. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>3. Any subsequent six-month renewal is not automatic, and is
subject to adherence to explicit benchmarks and milestones as set
forth in the plan submitted for the initial license. Review will
entail assessment by appropriate government agencies, at intervals
not to exceed six months, to determine if the licensee is showing
acceptable progress in meeting the milestones set forth in the
exporter's plan. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>4. For the initial license, the applicant must commit to
implementing a key escrow, key recovery or recoverable products
and services development plan based on the following elements: <br
wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>Criteria for Exporters <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>5. In its initial application, the applicant must describe its
business and marketing plan for developing key recovery, recoverable
or key escrow products and services during the two year
transition period. The plan must describe specific actions
(including, to the extent applicable, research and development, testing,
production, distribution and marketing achievements and goals)
and the kinds and magnitude of resources expected to be committed
under the plan. In addition, the plan must describe how the applicant
will make the transition within two years from the export of
56-bit non-key recovery or non-key escrow products and services
to the export of key recovery, recoverable or key escrow products
and services. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>6. By January 1, 1998, or within six months from receiving the
initial approval for export (whichever is later), the applicant
will indicate the arrangements for export purposes made for key
recovery or key escrow (which may be internal to the company) acceptable
to BXA. Criteria for key recovery or key escrow agents are in
Supplement No. 5 to part 742. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>7. The initial plan submitted by the exporter will provide the
basis for the review and approval of the initial license and any subsequent
renewals during the two year transition period. Exporters may
amend the plan as needed during the course of this period,
subject to review. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>Criteria for Non-Manufacturing Exporters </b><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>8. An initial license will be granted for export of non
recovery products and services only if the manufacturer of those products
has submitted, and had approved according to the criteria above,
a plan to develop key recovery, recoverable or key escrow
products or services. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p><b>Additional Factors </b><br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>9. An applicant may, at its discretion, provide other
information to indicate commitment to the development of a key management
infrastructure, such as: <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<dl>
    <dd>a. Participation in U.S. Government pilot programs; <br

        Committee on a Key Management Infrastructure; <br
        wp="br1">
        <br wp="br2">
        d. Participation in other encryption policy committees or

<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>744.9 Restrictions on activities of U.S. persons with respect
to certain encryption items. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(a) <u>General prohibition</u>. No U.S. person (as defined in
paragraph (c) of this section) may, without a license from BXA, knowingly
provide assistance to foreign persons, including providing
training, to manufacture or to export encryption items transferred
from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commerce Control List
(Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) pursuant to Executive
Order 13026. This provision does not apply to any activity
involving such encryption items that have been licensed or otherwise
authorized by the BXA. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(b) <u>Procedures for informing persons by BXA</u>. BXA may
inform U.S. persons, either individually or through amendment to the
EAR, that a license or other authorization is required because an
activity could involve the types of assistance described in paragraphs
(a) of this section. When such notification is provided orally,
it will be followed by a written notification within two working
days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export
Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse
the U.S. person from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph
(a) of this section. <br wp="br1">
<br wp="br2">
</p>

<p>(c) <u>Definition of U.S. person</u>. For purposes of this
section, the term U.S. person includes: <br wp="br1">

<dl>
    <dd>(1) Any individual who is a citizen or permanent resident
        alien of the United States; <br wp="br1">

    </dd>
</dl>

<p>(d) <u>License review standards</u>. Applications involving
activities described in section 744.9 will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis to determine whether the activity is
consistent with U.S. national security and foreign policy
interests. <br wp="br1">

<p><u>Commodity.</u> Any article, material, or supply except
technology and software. Note that the provisions of the EAR
applicable to the control of software (e.g. publicly available
provisions) are not applicable to encryption software. Encryption
software is controlled because, like the items controlled under ECCN 5A002,
it has a functional capacity to encrypt information on a computer
system, and not because of any informational or theoretical value
that such software may reflect, contain or represent, or that its
export may convey to others aborad. <br wp="br1">

<p>Export Administration Review Board (EARB). EARB voting members
are the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Attorney General
(for encryption exports), and the Director of the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and the Director of Central Intelligence are non-voting members.
The Secretary of Commerce is the Chair of the EARB. No alternate
EARB members may be designated, but the acting head or deputy
head of any agency or department may serve in lieu of the head of
the concerned agency or department. The EARB may invite the heads
of other Government agencies or departments (other than those identified
above) to participate in the activities of the EARB when matters
of interest to such agencies or departments are under
consideration. Decisions are made by majority vote. <br wp="br1">
