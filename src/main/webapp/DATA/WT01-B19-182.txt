<p align="center"><b>Government Marijuana Researcher Speaks
Favorably About Marijuana's Medical Utility</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 21, 1996:</b>&nbsp; In a recent
interview conducted by the Journal of the International Hemp
Association (JIHA) in Amsterdam, Dr. Mahmoud ElSohly -- Director
of the National Institute on Drug Abuse's (NIDA's) Marijuana
Project at the University of Mississippi and one of the federal
government's premiere marijuana experts -- spoke openly about
marijuana's medical potential. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Specifically, ElSohly discussed the possible medical role of
cannabichromene (CBC), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid in
marijuana.&nbsp; He also spoke about the limited effectiveness of
oral THC. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to ElSohly, CBC occurs in high portions of certain
strains of marijuana, but has been typically overlooked because
it is difficult to distinguish from the more familiar property, cannabidiol
(CBD), in standard chemical tests.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the
pharmaceutical properties of CBC and CBD are quite distinct. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;CBD is famous for [its] anti-convulsant activity ... [and]
CBC obviously has good anti-inflammatory activity,&quot; remarked
ElSohly.&nbsp; &quot;Certainly there is the [anecdotal use of
medical marijuana historically] and every day you look at the
cannabinoids and activities in the light of today's science and
today's pharmacology and so on, and you can really go back and
scientifically and legitimately explain the use of cannabis over
the years for so many things. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot; ... There is no question about the use of cannabis for
certain conditions.&nbsp; It does have a history.&nbsp; It does
have the utility and so on.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Responding to the issue of smoked inhalation of marijuana versus
orally consumed THC, ElSohly commented that THC in oral
preparation &quot;doesn't seem to be doing the good job it should.&quot;&nbsp;
He speculated that this is because oral and smoked THC produce
different pharmacological profiles in the body.&nbsp; Because
oral doses are processed by the liver before entering the
bloodstream, oral THC produces high levels of the metabolite
11-hydroxy-THC, while smoked marijuana does not.&nbsp; Since
11-hydroxy-THC is four to five times more psychoactive than regular
THC, this may explain why some users report a high rate of
overdoses and discomfort with Marinol. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The comments made by Dr. ElSohly indicate that their exists
not only anecdotal, but accepted scientific evidence supporting
marijuana's medicinal properties,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy
Director Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;It also specifies that
there exists chemical properties in marijuana other than THC that
hold medical value, further supporting the argument that
marijuana appears superior to synthetic THC as a medicine.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>House Holds Hearing On Adolescent Drug Use</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, 1996, Washington D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Purporting that adolescent drug use has reached &quot;epidemic&quot;
levels, a joint hearing of the House Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Youth and Families, and the House Government Reform
and Oversight Subcommittee on National Security was held today. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Those testifying before the House included Former Administrator
of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Robert Bonner,
Executive Vice President of the Parents' Resource Institute for
Drug Education (PRIDE) Douglas Hall, Ohio Congressman Rob
Portman, and others. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Hall's appearance before the committees coincided with the
release of a 1996 PRIDE survey indicating rising levels of
adolescent illicit drug use.&nbsp; According to the study, nearly
38 percent of high school seniors reported trying marijuana once
within the past year.&nbsp; &quot;Drug use by today's teenagers
is not just part of growing up, a youthful indiscretion,&quot;
said Hall.&nbsp; &quot;More students are using more drugs more
frequently, and their use is more hardcore than we have ever
seen.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Ladies and gentleman, drugs kill,&quot; announced Rep.
Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham, Chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Youth and Families.&nbsp;
&quot;It is more important than ever to be absolutely
uncompromising about this message.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;This hearing was nothing other than a pre-election dog and
pony show,&quot; said <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director Allen St.
Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;Despite claims from both parties that
spending toward anti-drug efforts have been slashed, federal
figures demonstrate that annual federal drug control spending increased
from less than five billion in 1988 to more than 15 billion for
fiscal year 1997.&nbsp; According to government statistics,
illicit drug use during this period of time has remained
virtually unchanged among adults and actually risen slightly
among adolescents.&nbsp; We cannot continue to keep throwing money
at the problem and arresting record numbers of adult users and
expect any sort of tangible results.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Medicine And Hemp Exposition To
Take Place This Weekend</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 26, 1996:</b>&nbsp; An exposition to
raise public awareness to the medicinal uses of marijuana will
take place on September 28 and 29 at the Golden Gate Park in San
Francisco, California.&nbsp; The show will include workshops by
both doctors and patients and will include a host of speakers,
including San Francisco Supervisors Angela Alioto and Tom Ammiano
as well as representatives of the Proposition 215 campaign for
medical marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Though the focus of the exposition will be on the medical uses of
cannabis, the event will also have forty booths relating to
hemp's industrial uses.&nbsp; In addition, the Human Rights 95
Exhibit, which poignantly documents the human costs of this
nation's &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; will also be featured at the
show. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Because of the controversy surrounding this issue, the show
promises to be one of the most interesting and well-attended of
the fall season,&quot; said California Coordinator Dale
Gieringer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Proceeds from the event will go to benefit the medical marijuana
movement in California. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact Dale Gieringer of
California </i><b><i>NORML</i></b><i> @ (415) 563-5858.&nbsp; For

<p align="center"><b>Mass/Cann NORML Rally Draws At Least 50,000</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 21, 1996, Boston, MA:</b>&nbsp; More
than 50,000 people gathered for a rally in support of ending
federal marijuana prohibition.&nbsp; The event, organized by
Mass/Cann NORML, featured speeches by <b>NORML</b> board member
Richard Evans, Esq., Steve Hager of High Times Magazine,
marijuana activist John Sinclair, Richard Stratton of Prison Life
Magazine, and others and included several musical acts.&nbsp;
There were almost no arrests during the all-day festival. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although organizers note that media coverage of the event was
mixed, Mass/Cann President Bill Downing called the seventh annual
event a &quot;success.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Any time you gather over 50,000 people and have no
incidents of violence and virtually no arrests is a
success,&quot; he commented.&nbsp; Responding to media criticism
about the relatively young age of some crowd-goers, Downing said,
&quot;Many of the younger attendees were Boston college students
-- many of which happen to be voters -- and we want them to be
aware that there is a group that represents their
interests.&quot; <br>
