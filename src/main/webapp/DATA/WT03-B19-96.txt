<h3>Celebrate the ADA -- Register to Vote</h3>
<p>
<i>By Cyndi Jones, Publisher</i>
<p>
Are you making plans to celebrate the sixth anniversary of the
signing of the ADA?
<p>
Last year we heard of more than 30 events around the country.
Parades, parties, picnics, letter-writing campaigns, essay
contests, city proclamations, press conferences, protests, sit-ins,
filing of ADA lawsuits and settling of ADA complaints -- you name
it, it happened.
<p>
This year, with the national election looming so large before us,
it is critical to show the strength of the disability rights
movement. The Anniversary of the ADA is just a few weeks in front
of the Republican and Democratic National Conventions. As the two
parties convene, it would be helpful for them to be able to
visualize us. July 26th is the perfect opportunity to host an event
where the disability community is visible -- showing the candidates
running for office that we are a large voting block.
<p>
A friend of mine makes a point of taking July 26th as a "personal
holiday" and doing something that he couldn't do before the ADA was
passed. Why don't you think about taking  a vacation day on July
26th this year? Do something creative to show what the ADA means to
you. I think it would be a great opportunity to spend the day
registering voters. You can ask a few of your friends to go with
you to a shopping center or public park. Not only will you be
helping to change the image of people with disabilities by getting
out and being seen "doing" something, but you will be working on
securing our rights by encouraging participation in the democratic
process. (By the way, when was the last time you did something to
support the ADA?)
<p>
According to the Unique People's Voting Project, (a non-profit
organization which encourages disabled people to vote), there are
51,000 people with disabilities per congressional district, or 15%
of the electorate. In 1994, 11 congressional races in California
alone were decided by less than 7% -- and some of those by a lot
less. What difference does that make nationally? Newt Gingrich
holds the third most powerful position in the United States by only
19 seats in Congress. People with disabilities make up a voting
block that is large enough to decide every election.
<p>
Disability issues cut across all political, economic and cultural
lines. Contrary to what opponents to the ADA want people to
believe, disability is not a special interest issue -- it is
everyone's issue. Every American will come face to face with
disability, either themselves, a family member or close friend.
To vote and campaign as a block, people with disabilities need the
information to tell them who helped us and who didn't. That is
exactly what MAINSTREAM will give you in the August '96 issue: A
Disability Rights Guide to Election '96. Find out if your
representative has voted Pro-Disability; or did s/he keep us busy
putting out political fires? We'll give you tips on getting out the
vote, registering your friends, the scoop on the permanent absentee
ballot, a litmus test for those in Congress and much more. See page
45 for more details and an order form for extra copies of the
voting guide.
<p>
But in the meantime, the question remains, what are you doing to
celebrate the ADA?
