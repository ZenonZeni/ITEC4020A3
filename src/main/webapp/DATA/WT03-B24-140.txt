<H2>Objective:</H2>
 
This research addresses information integration and interchange in a 
federation of heterogeneous information systems.  Individual systems 
may have distinct naming conventions, different meanings for similar 
data entities, differing time measurement schemes, and diverse 
uncertainty management schemes.  The goal is to investigate a 
federated architecture that allows individual systems to retain 
autonomy and responsibility over data and knowledge, while still 
sharing information with the other members of the federation.  
 
<H2>Approach:</H2>
 
The federation architecture consists of a <I>Federation Manager</I> to
handle the formulation, planning and processing of global queries,
and Federation Interface Managers (FIMs) to serve as agents for
local information systems, called federation constituents.  Local
users have access to their respective local information systems,
and perform the operations defined therein.  Each FIM contains an
object-oriented specification of the data and services the local
information system will provide to the federation.  FIMs may
communicate directly with each other, or may request assistance
from the Federation Manager to resolve different types of
inconsistencies, specifically terminology, time units and temporal
data model inconsistencies, and inconsistencies in answers provided
by different databases.  The Federation Manager contains several
cooperating modules that help to resolve inconsistencies:  an
active intelligent thesaurus to resolve semantic heterogeneity, a
temporal mediator to resolve temporal inconsistencies arising from
different temporal granularities in constituent databases, and a
harmony agent the integrates conflicting information from
constituent databases.
 
<H2>Hardware_Software_Prototypes_Available:</H2>
 
The Knowledge-Based Software Engineering Environment (KBSEE) has
been developed by Drs. Gomaa and Kerschberg under a NASA-sponsored
research project.  This environment is used for the domain modeling
portion of the I3 research.  The KBSEE runs on Sun Sparcstations
under Sun OS, and requires NASA's TAE user interface manager and
CLIPS expert system shell, as well as IDE's Software through
Pictures.  NASA has installed the KBSEE at Goddard Space Flight
Center in Code 520 for evaluation.  The key technologies being
exported are:  1) domain-independent tools for specifying domain
models, and 2) knowledge-based tools to generate target system
specifications from selected system features.  
 
 
<H2>Transitions:</H2>
 
<H3>Process Engineer's Expert Advisor</H3>
 
The KBSEE was used on a grant from the Virginia Center of Excellence
for Software Reuse and Technology Transfer, a Center of Excellence
funded by ARPA and located at the Software Productivity Consortium
(SPC) in Herndon, Virginia.    A domain model was specified for the
family of software process models that can be "generated" from the
Evolutionary Spiral Model (ESP) developed at SPC.  The KBSEE was
used to specify the domain model and the Knowledge-based
Requirements Elicitation Tool, KBRET, assists a Process Engineer to
select the requirements of a particular project, and then generate
the process model and the activities best suited to the project
requirements.  
 
<H3>Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS)</H3>
 
The KBSEE is being used to create a domain model of the EOSDIS 
Core System, under a contract with Hughes Applied Information Systems.  
The goal is to characterize the major components of the EOSDIS Core 
System (ECS) and then map the domain model to a client/server model 
that can drive a performance analysis model. <p> 
Several information integration issues are also addressed; 
specifically EOSDIS must interchange data with other agengies 
such as NOAA, International Partners, and associated data centers.  
Information integration and interchange is important to the 
generation of EOS Standard Products as well as for supporting 
user-specified derived products.  EOSDIS must support the concept of 
a <EM>federation</EM> of cooperating information systems.
 
<H3>Center for Information Systems Integration and Evolution</H3>
 
The Center for Information Systems Integration and Evolution is 
a <i>new</i> center at George Mason University which will focus 
on the important research and development issues confronting the 
nation in areas such as business process re-engineering, data, 
information and knowledge interchange, information integration in 
large-scale systems, and information systems evolution.<p>
We are witnessing the <i>right-sizing</i> and <i>re-engineering </i>of 
organizations to better address customer needs and to meet business 
imperatives for inserting information technology solutions.  
New architectures are being investigated which bring the computing 
resource to customers so as to capture information at its source, 
and to share that information as a corporate resource.  <p>
Moreover, there is a need to address <i>national challenges</i> such 
as health care, advanced manufacturing technology, the national 
information infrastructure and crisis management, all of which require 
inter-disciplinary approaches to the problem, therefore bringing together 
domain experts as well as information-, computer- and software- scientists 
and engineers to create new information system paradigms.  <p>
Large-scale systems require the integration and interchange of information 
from heterogeneous autonomous data systems. Examples are: the Logistics 
Anchor Desk involving collaborative planning among distinct agencies and 
the integration of information from multiple heterogeneous databases, 
the Human Genome Project, the Earth Observing System Data Information System 
(EOSDIS), and the Defense Information Systems Agency's efforts 
to integrate and evolve existing information systems. <p>
The Center's Director is Dr. Larry Kerschberg and the 
Associate Director is Dr. Hassan Gomaa.

<H2>LookingForTransitionOpportunities:</H2>
 
Larry Kerschberg participated in an ARPA Working Group to develop ideas for a 
new ARPA Initiative called the Logistics Anchor-Desk.  The Working Group 
meeting was held in conjunction with ARPA Planning Initiative PI Meeting 
held at Tucson, Arizona, February 23-25, 1994.
 
There has been considerable interest within the ARPA I3 community in 
our plan to provide independent agents that will interact with other systems 
to help them resolve information inconsistencies (and other possible 
services related to information uncertainty). Specifically, we 
have agreed to cooperate with the following projects:
