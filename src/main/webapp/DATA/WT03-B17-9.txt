<font size=+3><b>The Making of a Vietnamese Tycoon</font></b>
</center>

<hr>

<img src="../caps/icap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="I">n a sense, Duong Van Day was in the business of providing beds to visitors long before he assumed the reins of SaigonTourist in 1986. As leader of the Tong Hoi Sinh Vinh, the Ho Chi Minh City student movement which battled various U.S.-backed regimes during the war, Day and his colleagues frequently retreated to the jungle to meet with Viet Cong leaders. One colleague at the time who later joined Day at SaigonTourist remembers his first encounter with Day in the forest: "He helped the newcomers who were frightened. He took care of us and showed us how to make beds."<p>

If Day was helpful to others in the jungle, his role in the Tong Hoi Sinh Vinh, for which he was frequently jailed, proved useful to him as well. Amid the dense foliage and malaria of the forest, Day met the Viet Cong fighters who in 1975 later assumed important positions in government, and at SaigonTourist.<p>

Day's connections grew stronger when following the war, he continued his work with students in the HCMC Communist Youth Association, then considered a breeding ground for future leaders, and in 1976 became District 1 People's Committee Chairman. In 1986 he was tapped for the top job at SaigonTourist.<p>

At SaigonTourist, Day maintained his reputation as a fierce nationalist.<p>

He is remembered by some as an unyielding businessman, by others as a self-effacing man who would joke about his prodigious nose (in Vietnam, a physical trait identified with good business skills). Richard Cheung, a hotel entrepreneur renowned for closing the deal to rebuild the historic Caravelle Hotel, remembers Day as extremely patriotic. "He had guts," says Cheung. "If he thought a project was good for his country then it was good for him." Cheung, who negotiated with Day for two years before signing a deal under which Chains First put up the bulk of the capital but gave a 49% stake to SaigonTourist, also calls Day a gentleman and skilled businessman. "He always showed you respect, but at the end of the day, he'd drive the hardest bargain. He was smart. He didn't come up with a penny...just his friendship."<p>

At the helm of one of Vietnam's juggernaut state enterprises, armed with both a Bill Gates-like desire to dominate an industry and charm when he needed it, Day acquired an almost mythical stature in Ho Chi Minh City. "He had the reputation of a demi-god," says one hotel manager.<p>

But perhaps because Day fought for so long in the streets and in the jungle, he also kept his feet squarely on the ground. "In modern life we've seen many images of friends who because they've reached a certain position don't care about other people," says one long-time friend. "That was not Mr. Day. He was a rare person in that way."<p>
