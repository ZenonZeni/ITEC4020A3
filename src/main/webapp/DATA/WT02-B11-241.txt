         PARIS (Reuter) - International law enforcers called Thursday<br>
for tight checks on newly-invented rechargeable cashcards which<br>
they said could allow drug barons and other criminals to launder<br>
profits via the Internet.<br>
         The digital cashcards, which make it possible to order goods<br>
and services from home personal computers, could also allow<br>
money transactions and bypass the banking system.<br>
         Payments made with the cards, which are marketed by the<br>
Mondex firm in Britain, are carried out through an electronic<br>
chip.<br>
         ``The chip can contain millions of dollars. Unlike VISA<br>
cards, there is no registration of each operation,'' said Ronald<br>
Noble, a U.S. Treasury official leading the Financial Action<br>
Task Force which groups 26 rich nations.<br>
         ``It's a way of moving vast sums of money with no record of<br>
the transaction. The makers are looking at ways of tying the<br>
cards up to (the worldwide computer network) Internet,'' Noble<br>
told reporters after the agency's members held their annual<br>
meeting in Paris.<br>
         He said the agency had met the makers of the card about what<br>
he called ``cybercash'' and that they were being very<br>
cooperative about money laundering concerns.<br>
         Dirty money from drugs, arms trafficking and other serious<br>
crime worldwide totaled between $300 and 600 million, Noble<br>
said.<br>
         ``The Colombian Cali cartel is believed to generate revenues<br>
of 7 billion dollars a year -- that's the combined revenues of<br>
Toyota, Boeing and Pepsi,'' he added.<br>
