<p> Lin Tse-hsu saw that the opium trade, which gave Europe such
huge profits, undermined his country. He asked Queen Victoria to
put a stop to the trade. </p>

<p> After a long period of commercial intercourse, there appear
among the crowd of barbarians both good persons and bad,
unevenly. Consequently there are those who smuggle opium to
seduce the Chinese people and so cause the spread of the poison
to all provinces. Such persons who only care to profit
themselves, and disregard their harm to others, are not tolerated
by the laws of heaven and are unanimously hated by human beings.
His Majesty the Emperor, upon hearing of this, is in a towering
rage. He has especially sent me, his commissioner, to come to
Kwangtung, and together with the governor-general and governor
jointly to investigate and settle this matter. </p>

<p> All those people in China who sell opium or smoke opium
should receive the death penalty. If we trace the crime of those
barbarians who through the years have been selling opium, then
the deep harm they have wrought and the great profit they have
usurped should fundamentally justify their execution according to
law. We take into consideration, however, the fact that the
various barbarians have still known how to repent their crimes
and return to their allegiance to us by taking the 20,183 chests
of opium from their storeships and petitioning us, through their
consular officer [superintendent of trade], Elliot, to receive
it. It has been entirely destroyed and this has been faithfully
reported to the Throne in several memorials by this commissioner
and his colleagues. </p>

<p> Fortunately we have received a specially extended favor from
is Majesty the Emperor, who considers that for those who
voluntarily surrender there are still some circumstances to
palliate their crime, and so for the time being he has
magnanimously excused them from punishment. But as for those who
again violate the opium prohibition, it is difficult for the law
to pardon them repeatedly. Having established new regulations, we
presume that the ruler of your honorable country, who takes
delight in our culture and whose disposition is inclined towards
us, must be able to instruct the various barbarians to observe
the law with care. It is only necessary to explain to them the
advantages and disadvantages and then they will know that the
legal code of the Celestial Court must be absolutely obeyed with
awe. </p>

<p> We find that your country is sixty or seventy thousand li
[three li make one mile] from China. Yet there are barbarian
ships that strive to come here for trade for the purpose of
making a great profit. The wealth of China is used to profit the
barbarians. That is to say, the great profit made by barbarians
is all taken from the rightful share of China. By what right do
they then in return use the poisonous drug to injure the Chinese
people? Even though the barbarians may not necessarily intend to
do us harm, yet in coveting profit to an extreme, they have no
regard for injuring others. Let us ask, where is your conscience?
I have heard that the smoking of opium is very strictly forbidden
by your country; that is because the harm caused by opium is
clearly understood. Since it is not permitted to do harm to your
own country, then even less should you let it be passed on to the
harm of other countries - how much less to China! </p>
