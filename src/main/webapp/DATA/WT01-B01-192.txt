<B><FONT SIZE=1>ABSTRACT<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Purpose: We investigated the accuracy
and use of a robotic surgical arm compared to a human surgical
assistant during urological laparoscopic surgery.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Materials and Methods: A total of 11 patients undergoing
pelvic laparoscopic procedures that required identical bilateral
surgical manipulations was evaluated. On 1 side a robotic surgical
arm was used to manipulate the laparoscopic camera, while on the
contralateral side the camera was positioned by a human surgical
assistant. The side (left versus right) on which the robot was
used was alternated with each case. Parameters assessed included
operative time, erroneous camera motions, complications and outcome.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Results: All procedures were successfully completed
without complications. Laparoscopic camera positioning was significantly
steadier with less inadvertent movements when under robotic control
(p &lt; 0.0005). Operative times during dissections using the
robot or human assistant were not statistically different.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Conclusions: A robotic device can more effectively
manipulate and accurately control the video endoscope than a human
assistant during laparoscopic procedures.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=1>Robots have been a growing part of the manufacturing
industry for the last 30 years. Their service has proved the benefit
of using an untiring machine to perform precise repetitive tasks
in environments that at times may be uncomfortable or dangerous
for humans.<SUP>1</SUP> Computer integrated manufacturing uses
robotic automation to produce quality products that can be easily
updated through programming changes. Robots can outperform humans
in several tasks resulting in a decreased rate at which products
are rejected due to imperfections.<SUP>2</SUP> These characteristics
have demonstrated that robots, in proper applications, have a
significant economic advantage compared to human workers.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Recently, robots built specifically for medical applications
have been introduced. However, little data are available in assessing
their use compared to standard practice.<SUP>3-6</SUP> One such
category includes robots that hold and position the endoscope
during laparoscopic surgery.<SUP>4-6</SUP> Currently, this task
requires a dedicated individual for each procedure. A preliminary
assessment was done to compare the performance of a robotic device
with traditional assistance.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=1>MATERIALS AND METHODS <BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>We evaluated 11 patients undergoing a laparoscopic
urological operation. Eight men who were at high risk for metastatic
prostate cancer (prostate specific antigen more than 20 ng./ml.,
Gleason score more than 7) underwent diagnostic laparoscopic pelvic
lymphadenectomy according to a previously reported technique.<SUP>7</SUP>
Three women with true stress urinary incontinence underwent laparoscopic
Burch bladder suspension according to the technique described
by Polascik et al.<SUP>8</SUP> No patient had undergone prior
transperitoneal pelvic surgery. Surgery was performed similarly
on the right and left sides of the pelvis.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Accepted for publication August 18, 1995.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Assessment of camera control was standardized for
each procedure. For the pelvic lymph node dissection, evaluation
was begun at the incision of the peritoneum overlying the iliac
vessels, and was terminated once all nodal tissue was removed
and hemostasis was achieved. Any adhesions were incised before
initiating assessment and timing. During the bladder suspension,
the retropubic space was first completely dissected free and both
Cooper's ligaments were exposed before the evaluation. Assessment
was initiated once the first suture was passed into the abdomen
and was completed when the last suture on each side was tied.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>The laparoscopic camera was controlled by either
the operating surgeon using a robot* or by a human surgical assistant.
The surgeon controlled the robot via a foot pedal. The surgical
assistant moved the camera independently or based on voice commands
from the surgeon. The side (left versus right) in which the robotic
arm was used was alternated for each case. All surgical assistants
had experience holding a camera in at least 5 cases. The surgical
team used the robotic arm in the laboratory and gained experience
with 3 clinical cases before initiating the study.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Camera control was evaluated by 1 blinded individual
(L.R.K.) who reviewed videotapes in a random order and completed
standardized data sheets after all 11 procedures had been completed.
Parameters assessed included interval to complete each side of
the procedure, contact of the laparoscopic lens with internal
organs, unintentional camera motions (planar or in and out),
unintentional camera rotation, unintentional camera disconnection,
complications and outcomes. The operating surgeon completed a
survey to assess subjectively the performance of the robotic arm
compared to the surgical assistant. The robotic arm was rated
as worse than, better than or equal to the assistant.</FONT></p>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>To assess any additional time required to set up the robot in the operating room, operating room setup and breakdown
times were measured. Setup time was defined as the interval from
the time when the patient entered the operating room until laparoscopy
commenced. Breakdown time was the interval from completion of
surgery to when the patient left the operating room. These times
were compared to the setup and breakdown times in 8 contemporary
patients undergoing pelvic laparoscopic procedures (lymphadenectomy
in 5, bladder suspension in 2 and varix ligation in 1) in which
the robotic arm was not used. The paired Student t test was used
for statistical analysis.<BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=1>RESULTS<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>All procedures were completed successfully. In no
instance did robotic camera control have to be converted to human
assistant control. There were no intraoperative or early postoperative
complications.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>The average number of times that the laparoscope
came under contact with instruments or adjacent organs was statistically
greater for the assistant (human 2.4 &#177; 2.2, range 0 to 8
versus robot 0.7 &#177; 0.9, range 0 to 3, p &lt; 0.01). Inadvertent
movements of the laparoscope occurred an average of 4 &#177; 1
times per case when a human operated the camera (range 2 to 5)
compared to 1.6 &#177; 1.2 times for the robotic controlled side
(range 0 to 4, p &lt; 0.0005). Inadvertent rotation of the camera
occurred 2.2 &#177; 1.3 times per case (range 0 to 4) with human
control compared to 0.1 &#177; 0.3 times per case (range 0 to
1) with robotic manipulation (p &lt; 0.0009). The video endoscope
disengaged from the robotic arm once during the 11 cases.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>The mean surgical time for each side was not significantly
different (p &gt; 0.05) for either the bladder neck suspensions
or pelvic lymphadenectomies (human 26.3 &#177; 8.4 minutes versus
robot 24.9 &#177; 8.2 minutes). When comparing the study patients
to the 8 patients undergoing pelvic laparoscopy without the robot,
neither setup time (no robot 48 &#177; 12 minutes versus robot
42 &#177; 12 minutes) nor breakdown time (no robot 9.5 &#177;
2 minutes versus robot 12.4 &#177; 6 minutes) was statistically
different (p &gt; 0.05).</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Subjective assessment by the operating surgeon revealed
that the robot performed better than the assistant in 6 cases,
equal in 4 and worse in 1. The instance in which the robotic arm
was rated inferior was during case 2, in which the operating surgeon
believed that the great difficulty with dissection required frequent
movement of the camera. In the last 5 cases the robotic arm was
preferable to the assistant.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=1>DISCUSSION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Although often overlooked as a factor in the practice
of surgery, there are diverse physical and psychological abilities
among individual physicians.<SUP>9</SUP> Differences exist in
steadiness of the hand, agility, rapidity, preferences and surgical
knowledge. Moreover, surgeon performance may vary during the course
of a given procedure, when operating on different patients or
during the professional lifetime. Studies have demonstrated that
surgical complications decrease with experience but to our knowledge
no data exist to assess the effects of individual differences
on ultimate patient results.<SUP>10,11</SUP> These factors may
account for deviations noted when comparing surgical outcome studies
from different investigators.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>A method to help standardize surgical outcomes would
potentially be through the use of robotic systems. Many industries
have realized the advantages of using an untiring, efficient,
precise machine.<SUP>1,2</SUP> In surgery, similar automated systems
could be developed to perform surgical tasks or augment physician
skills. As in industry, these systems would be advantageous in
performing maneuvers that require a high degree of accuracy or
are repetitive and tedious. Moreover, robotic assistants can give the operating surgeon a greater amount
of direct control during a procedure.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Surgical stapling devices are an example of successful
integration of automated systems into clinical practice. These
tools allow surgeons to create a secure anastomosis while providing
less trauma, better precision and greater rapidity than a sutured
anastomosis.<SUP>12-14</SUP> Although a learning curve exists
for proficiency in the use of staplers, it is shorter than that
needed to learn a hand sewn anastomosis. Moreover, devices, such
as the end-to-end anastomosis stapler, extended the limits of
low anterior resection by enabling surgeons to perform reliable
anastomoses at lower levels than technically possible with traditional
hand sewn techniques.<SUP>14</SUP> As technology evolves, more
complex automated devices will be introduced for clinical evaluation.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Although the benefits and use of robotic systems
have been demonstrated industry, objective data are lacking to
assess the performance in medical applications. Our study was
an initial attempt to evaluate the performance of a robotic device
compared to traditional surgical assistance during laparoscopic
procedures. Pelvic lymphadenectomy and bladder suspension were
used, since these procedures require duplicate surgical maneuvers
that are identical on each side of the pelvis. The robotic arm
offered advantages compared to a human camera holder.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Our methodology has several limitations. The study
was not completely blinded. Although the reviewer did not know
which tape showed the assistant and which showed the robot, the
motions of each were readily apparent. Also, the human camera
holder knew that he or she was competing against a robot, which
biased the study towards the assistant because competitive spirit
prompted the assistant to be as effective as possible. Indeed,
we subjectively noted a marked improvement in camera holder performance
during the study. Despite this finding, the robot outperformed
the human based on all examined criteria. Moreover, the camera
assistant varied with each case while a singe robotic arm was
used throughout the study. The use of different assistants is
common practice at many institutions. The operating surgeon for
each case was also variable but all were relatively inexperienced
with use of the robotic arm.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Several major technical advances are needed before
robots become common in surgical practice. Appropriate end effectors
(that is graspers, scissors and dissectors) must be created to
meet a variety of applications. The robots must be &quot;user
friendly&quot; with transparent robot-to-surgeon interfaces. Automated
devices must be biocompatable to avoid mechanical failure or
injury to the patient. Computer control systems and software must
be improved to adjust for individual patient variations as well
as moment to moment changes within the surgical field. Some of
the technology required to meet these goals already exists in
various industrial and military applications.</FONT></p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1>Of greatest importance is the assessment of these
devices compared to traditional approaches. It must be proved
for each robotic tool that the ability of a surgeon to treat a
surgical disease is enhanced. Operative times, surgical results,
convalescence and morbidity must all be carefully appraised.
Finally, these benefits must be realized in a cost-effective manner.
