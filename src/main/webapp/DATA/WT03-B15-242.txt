<center><h1><i>Expatriate Protection Plans for USA & Canada</i></h1>
<p>
Expatriate Protection Plans by Crispin Speers & Partners with certain Underwriters at Lloyd's.
<p>
<b><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</center>
Designed specifically for non US or Canadian Nationals residing in the USA or Canada.
</b>
With three distinct Medical and Personal Accident Plans available, BUDGET, STANDARD and SUPER, the proposer is able to select an Insurance option best suited to his/her specific needs and requirements. An Expatriate Protection Plan is available for persons up to 75 years of age and includes cover whilst engaged in office or administrative occupations. For other occupations or for companies and groups, proposers are invited to seek tailor-made quotations which may include group discounts.
<p>
Each plan varies significantly in the scope of cover provided. It is therefore important for the proposer to carefully examine the options available to ensure that the appropriate Plan is selected. When assessing requirements, the proposer should consider the following salient features;
<p>

<p>
1) Cover only whilst in the USA or Canada<br>
2) Compulsory repatriation to the country for which a passport is held following serious accident or illness.<br>
3) No cover in the country for which a passport is held.<p>

<center><h2>STANDARD PLAN</h2></center>

I) Cover whilst anywhere in the world excluding the country for which a passport is held. <br>
2) No compulsory repatriation.<p>
<center><h2>
