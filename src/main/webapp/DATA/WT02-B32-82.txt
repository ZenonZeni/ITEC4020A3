<h4>The Sweeteners in Food (Amendment) Regulations 1996 (SI No 1477)</h4>

These amending Regulations have been published (following consultations) and come into force on 28 June 1996.  They amend an error in the Sweeteners in Food Regulations 1995.

<h4>Two Novel Foods  Cleared</h4>

Two further novel foods have been cleared for sale in Great Britain.  The foods are green tea extract for inclusion in tabletop sweeteners and guarana as an ingredient in "ready-to-consume" soft drinks, and as an infusate
<p>
<b>Green Tea Extract</b>:  Green tea extract (GTE), which is derived from the unfermented, dried leaves of the tea plant Camellia sinesis, is incorporated into a wide range of foods in Japan where claims are made that it reduces tooth decay.  The application to the ACNFP was for its use at low level (0.1%) in tabletop artificial sweeteners.  The Committee was satisfied as to its safety in this application
<p>
<b>Guarana</b>:  Guarana, which is obtained from  the seeds of the South American plant Paullinia cupana, is used in small amounts as a flavouring substance in certain ready-to-consume soft drinks, as well as being sold as an infusate.  The increasing use of products containing guarana in the UK in the early 1990s led to the ACNFPs evaluation of the safety of this novel food ingredient.  Initial consideration focused on claims that some products were caffeine free.  Such claims were not however substantiated by a MAFF survey and have since been withdrawn.  The ACNFP concluded that guarana was safe for human consumption but advised that caffeine levels should be kept below the advisory levels of 125 mg/l recommended by the Committee on Toxicity and the Food Advisory Committee.

<h4>Proposed New Imported Food Regulations to replace the Imported Food Regulations 1984</h4>

The Government proposes to replace the general provisions of the Imported Food Regulations 1984 and the Imported Food (Scotland) Regulations 1985 with a new set of provisions for the whole of Great Britain which will cover all imports of foodstuffs from third countries other than foodstuffs of animal origin.  The letter indicates that the proposed regulations are deregulatory in their intention.
<p>
The provisions of the proposed new Regulations are broadly similar to those in the Imported Food Regulations 1984 in so far as they continue to provide for public health inspections, at ports and airports, of imports from outside the European Community of foodstuffs other than those covered by the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1992.  Schedule 1 of the draft Regulations lists the products of animal origin exempt for the new Regulations.
<p>
The single offence contained within the Regulations is that "No person shall import into Great Britain from a third country any food which is intended for sale for human consumption and which fails to comply with food safety requirements".  It should be noted that this means that the offence in the present Regulations (relating to "unsound and unwholesome" food) has been dropped.  Consideration is still be given to whether foods containing pesticide residues above the MRL would be covered by the new offence.
<p>
Schedule 2 of the Regulations implements a change to the Transport Chapter IV para 2.2 of the Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations 1995 following a recently agreed amendment to the General Hygiene Directive 93/43.  It provides a derogation for oils and fats transported in bulk in sea going vessels from the original requirement for dedicated transport for the bulk transport of foods in liquid. powder and granulate form.

<h4>BSE CONTROLS - Proposed Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) Regulations 1996</h4>

When the present BSE scare erupted in late March (as a result of the revised advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee) the Government issued the Beef (Emergency Control) Order 1996, effective from the 29th March.  It prohibited the sale for human consumption of meat from bovine animals which, at the time of slaughter, had more than one pair of permanent incisors.  The aim was to exclude from the food chain meat from cattle more than 30 months old.  The Order was a temporary measure under Section 13 of the Food Safety Act 1990.  There were plans to replace it with a de-boning scheme.
<p>
However, the plan is now to retain the controls but replace them with new Regulations using Section 16 of the Act.  The controls would retain the main substance of the first Order but they will provide for additional flexibility when the proposed beef assurance scheme (BAS) becomes operational.  The controls do extend the prohibition to possession for sale and offering or exposing for sale as well as sale itself.
<p>
The proposed Regulations contain an Annex of countries (free of BSE) from where meat from bovine animals can be obtained and sold as an exception to the prohibition.  The countries listed are:<br>
Argentina, Australia, Botswana, Brazil, Mauritius, Namibia, New Zealand, Paraguay, Poland, South Africa, Swaziland, Uruguay, USA, Zimbabwe.

<h4>New Pesticide Residue Regulations</h4>

The controls on pesticides in Great Britain have been modified following the making of the Pesticide (Maximum Residue Levels in Crops, Food and Feeding Stuffs)(Amendment) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996 No 1487)
<p>
They implement into Great Britain the requirements of Directives 95/38, 95/39 and 95/61.  The first 2 of these set Community maximum residue levels for the pesticide concerned for the first time and Directive 95/61 sets Community maximum residue levels in substitution for levels (known as open positions) which were set for the pesticides concerned by Directive 93/58.
<p>
The Regulations make certain additional changes including add spices to the list of groups of products to which Community maximum residue levels apply.

<h4>REVIEW OF THE FOOD PREMISES (REGISTRATION) REGULATIONS 1991</h4>

The Department of Health has been reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the Food Premises (Registration) Regulations 1991 with a view to removing unnecessary burdens on business while maintaining appropriate safeguards on public health.  As a result of the review, two proposals have been made:<p>

(i) the removal of the requirement on food businesses to register at least 28 days before starting to operate;<br>

(ii) to exempt the domestic premises of members of the Women's Institute (WI) who produce food for sale in WI markets from the requirements to register.<p>

Attached to the letter is a short paper explaining the proposals.<p>

With regard to (i), it indicates that the Department believes that the requirement to give 28 days notice deters some self-employed people from taking the opportunity to start up, particularly when the work may only be short-term, and tends to impact unfavourably on the small business operator.  The new control would only require a business to make an application to register before starting to trade.  Registration by a local authority would have to be completed "as soon as is practicable".<p>

With regard to (ii), at present WI members who produce food on a regular basis for sale in WI markets are required to register with the local authority.  The paper indicates that this is unnecessary since:<br>
- the food is usually microbiologically of relatively low risk (for example, jam); and<br>
- the WI markets from which the food is sold will themselves be registered with the local authority.<p>

<h4>ACNFP Report: Use of Interesterified Fats/Oils in Yellow Fat Spreads<br>
FOOD SAFETY CLEARANCE - Enzymic Interesterification Process</h4>

The Government has accepted advice from the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP).  It has extended the scope of food safety clearance already given for the use of an enzymic interesterification process to allow the production of fats and oils for use in yellow fat spreads.  The previous application had resulted in the approval for the use of fats/oils produced by a novel enzymic interesterification process, in chocolate and confectionery fats and as an ingredient at up to 20% in frying fats.  The manufacturer (Unilever) had sought permission to use fats/oils produced  by the process in yellow fat spreads.
<p>
Enzymically modified vegetable oil is produced by using enzymes to restructure the fats present in an oil, this is followed by conventional refining techniques.  The enzymes intended for use in this process are currently being considered by the Food Advisory Committee (FAC) and the Committee on Toxicity (COT)
<p>
During its considerations, the ACNFP noted that the basic principles of the process were the same as those considered previously, the only difference being the that the starting materials were adjusted to obtain fats/oils suitable for use in yellow fat spreads.  The Committee reviewed data which suggested that the use of these fats/oils in margarine and spreads would have a beneficial nutritional effect in that it would reduce the amount of saturated, trans fatty acids in such spreads and hence reduce the intake from theses sources.
<p>
Copies of the report are available from the Ministry.

<h4>Proposed Eggs (Marketing Standards)(Amendment) Regulations 1996</h4>

These proposals will implement the Eggs (Marketing Standards) Regulations 1995.  They will provide national authorities with enforcement powers foe the latest amendment to the Commission Regulation, No 2401/95.  this allows the use of the term "eggs from caged hens" as a labelling option on egg packs or the term "cage production" to be stamped on eggs, subject to the criteria laid down in the EC Regulation.
<p>
In addition, the Regulations will be amended to incorporate a definition of the term "sale" to clarity an issue with regard to the original Regulations and to supplement existing references to certain Articles contained in the Commission rules on egg marketing which require the use of the official mark.
<p>
It is intended to introduce the amending Regulations in July 1996.  The Regulations are enforced by the MAFF Egg Marketing Inspectorate.

<h4>DEFINITION AND DETERMINATION OF DIETARY FIBRE</h4>

Following continuing discussions (and controversy) about how to define dietary fire for labelling purposes, MAFF has issued draft amended guidance to take into account developments in food products and at an EC level.<p>

UK practice has been to require data on the fibre content of foods to be declared on the basis of "<i>non starch polysaccharides (NSP) as measured by the technique of Englyst</i>".  This definition was used by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy to recommend a daily fibre intake of 18g (the Dietary Reference Value - DRV).  Subsequently, the Food Advisory Committee gave guidance on the use of claims based on this figure.<p>

However most other EC countries use the AOAC method for the determination of fibre.  The draft guidance will now permit the use of alternative techniques  but recommends that, when data is not based on the UK method, then the label should include a statement clarifying the basis of any declaration and the method of analysis used.  Similarly, if claims about fibre are made on the basis of definitions and methods of measurement recommended in other countries, the claims cannot be related to the UK's DRV of 18g per day.  Additional information will be needed relating the claim to an appropriate DRV.

<h4>Updating of UK Regulations on Pesticides and European Legislation on Plant Protection Products</h4>

The Pesticides Safety Directorate (PSD) has circulated proposed changes to these controls.  Three draft Regulations were circulated:
<p>
1) Draft Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations.  The proposed amendments are described as being minor amendments to the Control of Pesticide Regulations 1986.  They amend the scope of the controls, they amend aspects relating to the recover of products in the event of a breach f the Regulations, to access to information by the public and changes to the Consents provided by the Regulations.
<p>
2) Draft Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations.  These would be new controls introducing requirements similar to those applied to pesticides.
<p>
3) Plant Protection Products (Amendment) Regulations.  These implement certain Commission Directives into UK legislation and make adjustments to take into account item 2)
<p>
Comments were requested by 13th June.

<h4>DRAFT DAIRY PRODUCTS (HYGIENE) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS</h4>

The Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 implement EC Directive 92/46, as amended, which harmonises EC hygiene rules on productions and trade in milk and milk products.  Provisions include structural requirements, hygiene and microbiological standards.  The Regulations apply to England and Wales.
<p>
The purpose of the amending Regulations is to implement:<br>
(1) EC Decision 95/165 laying down uniform criteria for small businesses processing milk based products that wish to benefit from derogations from certain structural and equipment requirements of the Directive.  The Decision:<br>
<ul>
<li>increases the upper limit on the amount of milk that can be processed annually by small businesses benefitting from these derogations.  This has already been implemented administratively in the UK;
<li>requires benefitting businesses to keep records that will enable enforcement officers to ascertain that the business complies with the upper limit;
<li>requires new applicants wishing to benefit from the derogations to apply in writing and to provide information in support of that request;
<li>requires that derogations should only be given if they do not adversely affect hygieneic conditions of production.</ul>
(2) EC Decision 95/340 establishing the list of third countries approved for the export of milk and milk based products to the Euorpean Union.<br>
(3) certain other requirements of Directive 92/46, as amended, relating to the levels of somatic cell counts in raw buffaloes' milk for processing into milk products (reflecting EC Corrigenda) and plate counts in pasteurised milk prior to a second heat treatment(ommitted in error from the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations).
<p>
Comments were required by 30th April with the plan to implement amending Regulations during June 1996<p>

<h4>DH GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS: re “FOOD HANDLERS: FITNESS TO WORK”</h4>

In August 1995, the Department of Health publish a Document Entitled “Food Handlers - Fitness to Work”.  It was directed at food businesses, enfrocement officers and health professionals.  It provided detailed information upon which to base decisions on how to assess the employment of people who may have suffered illness which could be tranmitted to other people via food which they are handling.  It is available for £2.50 from the Department of Helath, PO Box 410, Wetherby, LS23 7LN, UK.
<p>
The Deprtment has now published simplified guidance for both food business managers and for food handlers.  The first contains relevant sections of the full document.  The second is a four page leaflet giving key responsibities for food handlers relating to when to wash hands and when you should “tell your boss”.  Both these documents are available free from the Department of Health at the address in the first paragraph.

<h4>GOVERNMENT GIVES FOOD SAFETY CLEARANCE TO NOVEL STARTER CULTURE</h4>

The Government has accepted advice from the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) and has given food safety clearance to a novel starter culture for use in cultured milk produced by MD Foods.  The novel starter culture (Enterococcus faecium strain K77D) is the second starter culture to be considered by the ACNFP, and has been approved in Denmark since 1993.<p>

In assessing the safety of this starter culture, the Committee was aware of increasing numbers of cases of infection in hospitals with strains of E. faecium that are resistant to antibiotics, especially vancomycin.  However, the Committee was satisfied that the particular strain is non-pathogenic, and sensitive to a range of antibiotics including vancomycin.<p>

The Committee's safety evaluation concentrated particularly on the history and identification of this particular strain, and the specification and quality control criteria used to ensure a consistent product.<p>
