<I><DD>I want to apologize for not updating the site as promptly as it has been in the
past - this is strictly due to the fact that my life has been incredibly hectic as of
late.  Aside from this, be assured that I've carefully considered every e-mail I've
received, and yes, I'm still aware that my spelling sucks.

<DD>I'm a ninth grader and my history class is doing a project on 
the 1996 Presidential Election. My topic to research is polling 
questions. I need to know how people who write polls come up with the 
the polling questions that are asked. Thanks for the help!<BR>
<a href="mailto:wsnyder@trex.idbsu.edu">wsnyder@trex.idbsu.edu</a><br>
<I><DD> - I can't comment on how anyone else comes up with questions, but I
try to create objective and non-pointed questions, giving respondents the opportunity
to select a diverse group of answers - enough so that almost every viewpoint
is covered.  It's difficult given the diversity of people; no matter what
you come up with, chances are there's always some group of people who claim
they're being discriminated against.<BR>
 - Ed.
</I>
<P>

<DD>I noticed in the Survey that you(plural) had too many 'polar' choices,
and not enough in between 'gray area' choices.  The Political Survey #3 was extremely hard to answer, because in order
to pick almost any of the given choices I would have to comromise my
beliefs. I don't know how you can improve on this though without adding
more choices.
<BR>

<P>

<DD>When are you going to have new surveys?  You've had the same ones for 
months and it shows... the O.J. Simpson Poll?  No one cares.<BR>
<a href="mailto:xerex@rmii.com">John Brown</a><br>
<I><DD> - I agree.  I've been long overdue in adding new surveys; this has not
been the result of laziness -- just limited time.  My latest project, an 
<a href="http://www.icorp.net/lac/">Online classified database system</a> (of
which I'm currently running a regional prototype) has
been ongoing and I regret not spending more time on Survey.Net.  In the future,
much more time and attention will be spent on this system, including lots of
new features including tables, charts and graphs of statistics, and of course
lots of new surveys.<BR>

<DD>I just finished taking/reading all of the surveys.  I think this is a 
good idea whose time has come.  Keep up the good work.

<DD>;Survey Suggetsion
: The Interent and health
Do people use the internet to find information out about their 
health ? and if so, what information do they look for  ? How do they use 
the information they find ?, where do they get it from ? and why ?
ie. Is it very personal and they don't want a face to face 
meeting with their physician. Or do they feel that the issue is too 
trival to bother their physician. How many people consult their 
physician via the Internet ?<BR>

<DD>sorry but this letter is basically just a bitchfest about the type of
responses that we read. we were shocked at some of the obnoxious
responses made by the predominantly white pro-life conservative
right-wing religous older financially secure male zealots. many of these
people were probably the same ones that voted for reagonomics.and we all
know where that led to, the biggest national debt in the shortest time
period. aren't we still paying for that 2-term debacle? they complain
about scandals but what about iran-contra and "i don't remember or i do
not recall".does america need another senile president leading us into
the 21st century? on that note,people bitch about clinton's lack of
foreign policy skills, but i don't recall clinton puking on any foreign
dignitaries lately. people seem to believe that the country can only be
run by upper-class white christian men with antiquated ideals. wake up
and smell the cappuccino!!!it's a new age and we demand equal
representation.

<DD>Um, Libertarians are socially liberal?  Where does 
that come from?  Libertarians are a conservatives 
conservative.  Less government.  Period.  Doesn't 
get much more conservative than that.<BR>

<DD>It seems to me that the results of this survey suggest that your virtual

<BR>
<a href="mailto:walden@radix.net">walden@radix.net</a><br>
<P>

<DD>The recent poll that I took was a joke. Keep your propaganda off the net. 
It was suppose to be a poll not a Harry Brown campaign ad. Here's some 
advice. Don't disgrace your candidate or your party with stunts like this. 
 If you have anything that you want to say in defense of your poll please 
send me your arguments.
<BR>
<a href="mailto:James007@mail.utexas.edu">James A. Jones Jr</a><br>
<I><DD> - I keep wondering why people automatically assume I'm Libertarian.  I'm
not.  If you all must know, I'm officially registered as an "Independent".  As I've
said in the past, the Libertarians seems to be more active and organized online,
thus they appear more prominent.<BR>

<P>

<DD>how do you explain that a man with the clinton record could even be 
considered as a serious candidate.And how about his health problem...do 
we want algore as president?
how can the American people be dumb enough to reelect a coward who is 
corrupt morally and in every way worth considering? do we want a man of 
this caliber leading us?  He hides continually behind his fortress in DC 
and we should be so ashamed that we cringe when he is ever on the boob 
tube.

<DD>Dear Sir or Madam:
Could you please update your presidential election survey to include 
candidates who have entered the race?
I am especially asking that you include Howard Phillips of the United 
States Taxpayers' Party in the listing. 
Phillips was nominated by the United States Taxpayers' Party on August 
18, 1996 at their national convention.
<BR>
<a href="mailto:adamv@knuth.mtsu.edu">Adam Valle</a><br>
<P>

<DD>In your survey.net political poll, you have inadvertantly omitted Howard
Phillips, the nominee of the U.S. Taxpayers Party (which is on the ballot in
over 40 states and is growing rapidly).
The web site is at http://USTaxpayers.org.
Please make the correction on your poll options so it can represent the full
spread of available candidates nationwide.<BR>
<a href="mailto:GregM7@aol.com">Greg Moeller</a><br>
<P>

<DD>Please add Howard Phillips of USTP (<a href="http://www.ustaxpayers.org">www.ustaxpayers.org</A>) to your poll as
a candidate.  He will be on 42-45 state ballots this year, many more
than Raplh Nader.  USTP is one of 6 national parties recognized by the
FEC.  I think fairness demands he be listed.<BR>
<a href="mailto:mkturner@erols.com">Mitch & Cheryl Turner</a><br>
<I><DD> - Howard Phillips and the USTP are now on the ballot<BR>
 - Ed.
</I>
<P>


<DD>About the only thing that I've seen from any poll on the net is that a
majority of people use the net are white, rich, and libertarian... Even
though you claim no scientific accuracy, I would go as far as saying that
this type of poll is absolutly worthless as an indication of any sort of
wider voter trend, as the demographics of people likely to use the net
are too limited to make anything more than a pitifully small and non-
representative sample.
<BR>
<a href="mailto:slacker@inetnebr.com"> Brent McKibbin</a><br>
<I><DD> - I would argue with you on some of your points.  I agree that the Internet's
demographics are different from the mainstream (then again, anyone who claims to
know exactly what defines "mainstream" is probably not on the mark either), but I sincerely believe that the
trends and attitudes exhibited online are a preview of the overall trends of our
society - after all, tens of thousands of new people come online each month; the reach
of the Internet is invading almost all political, cultural and economic areas of 
society.  What we're seeing now online may be a preview of the overall future outlook
of the majority.<BR>

<DD>If Harry Browne is not invited to the Presidential Debates, then I can only
conclude that we ALL our Slaves of the Liberal Media and of the advocates

<a href="mailto:psroufe@ibm.net">Peter L. Sroufe</a><br>
<P>

<DD>Please ask how many people believe that Harry Browne and other
alternative candidates belong in the debates. I think most people will
say yes. Then give the results to the Commission on Presidential

<DD>subject: irs and its extreme inefficiency

i followed the following steps to receive my refund:
1.)up to this time i spent 46 hours  of time  and $200 of my money for calling irs, regarding my refund
2.)i suppose to get refund of ~$4500  on  ~02-20-96
i received  only ~$1200 due to some error  in 1989 taxes in california
to find what was happening it took  until ~03-20-96 and pursue further by my insistance  irs arranged a “problem resolution case worker”
she found it is a computer error,not your error
3.) case worker told me  on ~04-20-96   my check  for ~$3600 in mail.
i called case worker after 3 weks,she told that it was mailed to my california  address(even though i had given my present address in typing)
4.)austin case worker on ~05-10-96 ask me to call irs fresno california  to re-issue this check to my present address in texas  
5.)i called on ~04-10-96 to california .they told me i have to fill out a “tracer”(form 3911) form and i received it after 2 weeks
6.)i mail “tracer” form on ~06-10-96 to fresno.
irs told me  it will to trace the check 6 months to 1 year and longer
7.)i called irs fresno on 9-10-96 to find out  my tracer form.they are invesrigating whether the check cashed or not
irs told me it takes one to three months to find out
i asked what is after that?
if check is not cashed(at least 3 months) ,irs will send a form to me(2 weeks) and it take another month (one month)to re-issue a check  after completed form received from me (two weeks)
if i am lucky i wii receive check in five months from to-day(9-27-96)that is some time in march 1997
8.)at this  stage i am confused and helpless , said to myself be patient and wait a year  or year and half until irs re-issue  check.
as you know, irs never even reply to me,even if they reply it does not make any sense 
9.)the way it looks to me irs calender runs to solve problems  in increments of one(1) month,three(3) months,six(6) months,one(1) year and longer thanone(1) year

by talking to irs about 46 hours,i came to the conclusion,  people in irs  are inefficient,ignorant,under-educated,lazy,tardy,easy going,fish-brain,
non-trainable group of people!  what a pity it is !

i hope you work on a legislation to make irs  changed to better managed efficient organization
