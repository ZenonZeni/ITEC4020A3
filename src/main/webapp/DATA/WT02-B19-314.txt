The staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy recently released a draft for the reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). The draft includes several changes to IDEA. Following is an overview of some of those changes, as well as CEC's responses to the proposals.<P>
<CENTER><B><U>KEY FEATURES OF SENATE DRAFT</B></U><BR>

<B><U>CEC's RESPONSE</B></U><BR>

</CENTER><B>Definitions<BR>
</B><BR>
The Senate draft does not add new disability categories to the 13 categories already listed under IDEA.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports the Senate's decision, but urges the Subcommittee to adopt the Administration's proposal to change the term "serious emotional disturbance" to "emotional disturbance."<P>
CEC recommends the Senate allow states the option of using the term "developmental delay" for ages 3 through 8, to allow children with disabilities to be served in the primary grades without the need for the designation of a diagnostic category.  <I>Currently, children ages 3 to 5 may be served under this term</I>.<BR>

<B>Grants to States</B><P>
The draft proposes to: simplify eligibility requirements; increase local flexibility in the use of funds and program innovation; continue the current funding formula based on the number of students receiving special education services; and maintains the 40% average per-pupil expenditure authorization level.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports retaining the current formula for state grants.  A formula change could cause large shifts in the amount of funds states receive to assist in providing services to children with disabilities.  Also, a formula change may penalize states that have worked diligently to identify and serve all students with disabilities.<P>
CEC also supports retaining language specifying the federal commitment to children with disabilities.  Even though the federal government has never met its commitment to provide states 40% of the average per pupil expenditure for every child with a disability, it is extremely important to work towards this goal.<BR>

<B>Incidental Benefit</B><P>
The draft allows local funds to be provided to a child with a disability in a regular class, even if one or more nondisabled children benefit from those services.  The draft also allows incidental benefit to children covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.<BR>

<P>
CEC strongly supports this language, as these common sense provisions will go a long way in allowing teachers and related services personnel to provide services to IDEA eligible children without regard to the incidental benefit to other children.<BR>

<B>Re-Evaluation</B><P>
The draft stipulates that re-evaluations occur every three years OR at key transition junctures in the educational process, such as the transition from elementary school to middle or junior high school.<BR>

<P>
CEC strongly supports this stipulation, and believes that it, coupled with provisions related to situations in which additional data is not needed, will promote more useful and appropriate evaluations.<BR>



<BR>
<B>Notification of School of Intention to File a Complaint</B><P>
The draft requires parents to notify the school of their intention to file a complaint at least 10 days prior to the date of filing if parents have new information or if the local education agency is unaware of the nature of the complaint.<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<BR>
CEC believes this provision will assist schools and parents to work together to solve problems before the need for litigation.<BR>

<B>Mediation</B><P>
The draft requires secondary education agencies to provide mediation as an option to parents.<BR>

<P>
While CEC affirms the need for parents to have the support they need for mediation and a role in structuring the mediation, we are concerned that the process does not result in an adversarial situation as sometimes results in the current due process procedures.<BR>

<B>Preschool Program</B><P>
The draft retains the current formula for this program.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports the retention of the formula.  We are concerned that the coordination language does not have the 1 percent cap that is included for state-level coordination activities under the larger Part B program, and urge the Subcommittee to institute a similar cap.<BR>

<B>Support Programs</B><P>
The draft's Part D, Research and Personnel Preparation, provides a program section and budget authorization for research and innovation activities under the areas of: New Knowledge Production; Integration of Research and Practice; and Improving the Use of Professional Knowledge.  The draft also provides a program section and budget authorization for personnel preparation activities under the areas of: High Incidence Disabilities; Leadership Preparation; Low Incidence Disabilities; and Projects of National Significance.<P>
The support programs would continue to be administered at the federal level.<P>
The draft directs that the Secretary <U>may</U> direct funds into critical areas.<BR>

<P>
CEC acknowledges that the Senate provides a sound basic framework for the vital support of IDEA programs.  While the number of appropriation line-items would be reduced, proven components of the existing support programs would be retained with the overall proposed funding level constant in relation to the currently level of fiscal support.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
CEC has long proposed this continuation. <P>
<BR>
This approach should be changed to <U>shall</U>.  CEC understands that instances occur where <U>may</U> is the appropriate approach, but we must guard against giving near total flexibility to the department respecting annual allocations.  Many of the functions covered through the support authorities are critical services, and the disruption caused by on-again, off-again funding would be significant.<BR>

<B>Indexing of the Support Programs</B><P>
The draft establishes precedents that affirm the principle of indexing support activities within both Part B and Part H.  Specifically, portions of the Part B draft with respect to studies and evaluations and <BR>

<P>
CEC believes all of the IDEA support programs should be indexed within Parts B and H of the Act. While a controversial proposal, we have witnessed this year how severely these programs can be <BR>

portions of the Part H draft with respect to the FICC include indexed functions.<BR>

threatened in actual appropriations, precipitating a forceful national reaffirmation of the vital importance of these support functions.<BR>

<B>Early Intervention</B><P>
The draft includes an amendment on the uses of funds, which states that "...in any State that does not provide services for at-risk infants and toddlers...to strengthen the statewide system by initiating, expanding, or improving collaborative efforts related to at-risk infants and toddlers..."<BR>

<P>
CEC questions the need for such an amendment.  It is our understanding that the use of Part H funds for child identification, evaluation, and referral is already an allowable use of funds and that, in fact, many States so use their funds for this purpose.  The proposed language may actually limit the intended uses of funds, since it refers only to States not serving at-risk children.  A number of States serving at-risk children have narrowly defined the eligible population.  The proposed language might be interpreted as prohibiting them from using funds to evaluate and refer other at-risk children.  If confusion exists, it should be clarified in report language.  <BR>

<B>Policy/Regulations</B><P>
The draft prohibits the Secretary of Education from establishing a new rule without following the public comment and review requirements of the Administrative Procedures Act.  The draft also requires the Secretary to publish in the <I>Federal Register</I> a list of correspondence from the Department of Education and include a description of the interpretation of the Department.<BR>

<P>
CEC supports both of these proposals.<BR>

<B>Personnel Standards</B><P>
The draft retains the current statute respecting personnel standards.<BR>

<P>
CEC urges the inclusion of three important modifications with respect to the "highest requirement" provisions: the statute must specifically assign responsibility for establishing and maintaining standards to the state education agency.<BR>
Further, we believe that the foundational role of the professions in setting standards is vital and would use the term "professional standards" throughout this section.  Finally, we recommend inclusion of the following language in the statute:  "Establishment and Use of Levels of Personnel Within Disciplines.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, nothing prohibits the establishment and use by the State education agency of different levels of personnel, including paraprofessionals, within specific occupations or disciplines if the State also specifies appropriate roles and responsibilities, training, and direct and indirect supervision for each level."<BR>

<B>CSPD</B><P>
The draft retains the requirement that each state maintain a comprehensive system of personnel development. <BR>

<P>
CEC remains concerned that any personnel development plan be developed and promoted through a process that promotes linkages in each State among all involved State agencies, institutions, <BR>


and organizations that are concerned with a continuing supply of qualified personnel to serve children with disabilities.  <BR>

The draft also includes the concept of in-state partnerships as a major feature of the new proposed Part C.<BR>

CEC favors the inclusion of this feature, and look forward to discussing how that concept may be specifically applied to the CSPD and will continue to encourage a Professional Development Coordinating council (PDCC) charged with the specific task of developing and implementing the in-state CSPD.<BR>


<P>
As reported in previous CAN mailings, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities has released two drafts on the reauthorization of IDEA, and CEC commented on these proposals as well.  It is not yet known when either house will issue an official bill; however, the disability and education communities hope that the reauthorization process will be completed by next spring.  We will keep you updated on the status of the reauthorization process.
