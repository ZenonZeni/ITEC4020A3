The Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX/Poseidon) is a cooperative project between
the United States and France to develop and operate an advanced satellite
system dedicated to observing the Earth's oceans. The mission provides
global sea level measurements with an unprecedented accuracy. The data from 
TOPEX/Poseidon is used to determine global ocean circulation and to understand
how the oceans interact with the atmosphere. This understanding will improve
our ability to predict global climate.<P>

For this joint mission, the 
<A HREF="http://hypatia.gsfc.nasa.gov/NASA_homepage.html/">
National Aeronautics and Space Administration
 </A> (NASA)
is providing the satellite bus and five instruments with their associated
ground elements. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is responsible for project
management, and will operate and control the satellite through NASA's Tracking
and Data Relay Satellite System. The Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)
is furnishing two instruments with their associated ground elements and a 
dedicated launch on Ariane rocket. Both CNES and NASA provide precision
orbit determination and process and distribute data to 38 science 
investigators from nine nations, as well as other interested scientists.<P>
In the summer of 1992, TOPEX/Poseidon was launched into orbit by an Ariane 
rocket from the European Space Agency's Space Center located in Kourou, French
Guiana. From its orbit 830 miles (1,336 kilometers) above the Earth's surface,
TOPEX/Poseidon makes sea level measurements along the same path every 10 days
using the dual frequency altimeter developed by NASA and the CNES single 
frequency solid-state altimeter. This information is used to relate changes in
ocean currents with atmospheric and climate patterns. Measurements from NASA's
Microwave Radiometer provide estimates of the total water-vapor content in
the atmosphere, which is used to correct errors in the altimeter measurements.
These combined measurements allow scientists to chart the height of the seas
across ocean basins with an accuracy of 5 inches (13 centimeters).<P>
Three independent techniques determine the satellite altitude within 4 inches
(10 centimeters). NASA's Laser Retroreflector Array is used with a network of
10 to 15 satellite laser ranging stations to provide the baseline tracking data
for precision orbit determination and calibration of the radar altimeter bias.
The DORIS system, recently demonstrated by the French SPOT-2 mission, provides
an alternate set of tracking data using microwave Doppler techniques. The
system is composed of an onboard receiver and a network of 40 to 50 ground 
transmitting stations, providing all-weather, global tracking of the satellite.
NASA's Global Positioning System Demonstration Receiver demonstrates a new
technique for precise, continuous tracking of the spacecraft.<P>
TOPEX/Poseidon is a vital part of a strategic research effort to explore
ocean circulation and its interaction with the atmosphere. It is timed to
coincide with and complement a number of international oceanographic and 
meteorological programs, including the World Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and
the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program, both of which are 
sponsored by the World Climate Research Program (WCRP). TOPEX/Poseidon is a
three-year mission with the potential for a two-year extension. Results from the
TOPEX/Poseidon will build the foundation for a continuing program of long-term
observations of ocean circulation from space, and for an extensive ocean
monitoring program in the next century.<P>
