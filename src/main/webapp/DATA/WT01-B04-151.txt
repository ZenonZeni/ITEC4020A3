<H2><CENTER>MARIJUANA IS NOT MEDICINE. SOMEBODY HAD BETTER TELL YOUR DOCTOR!
</CENTER>

  <DT>I give people dangerous drugs. 
  <DT>I am responsible for a lot of people using narcotics. 
  <DT>I am an oncologist. 
  <DT>I do not recommend marijuana.

<H3><CENTER>IS MARIJUANA A MEDICATION?</CENTER>
</H3>
My definition of a medication is a drug treatment that is aimed at one of
the following three goals:<BR>
<BR>
1. the prolongation or preservation of life, <BR>
2. the support of functioning or <BR>
3. the relief of discomfort. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>The use of drugs for other purposes is not medicine.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
My guiding principle in caring for a patient is that any medication that
I use must be the best available treatment for that particular situation.
Because of this, marijuana cannot be considered a medication. <BR>
<H3><CENTER>IS MARIJUANA NOT A MEDICATION BECAUSE IT IS TOXIC?</CENTER>
</H3>
Some of the drugs we use in the medical treatment of cancer have toxic side
effects. The toxic effects of a drug don't necessarily disqualify it as
a medication. Sometimes it is worth using a very toxic medication if the
potential benefits are great. For example, many cases of leukemia can be
cured but at the cost of severe side effects. In some cases, the severe
side effects are not a risk -- they are a certainty. <BR>
<H3><CENTER>IS MARIJUANA NOT A MEDICATION BECAUSE IT IS UNCONVENTIONAL?</CENTER>
</H3>
Just because a treatment is not &quot;conventional&quot; doesn't disqualify
it as a medication, either. Sometimes, there are no conventional treatments
available for a particular problem. After weighing the risks and benefits
of an unusual treatment, my patient may feel that he or she wants to undergo
an alternative therapy. If I am sure that my patient is fully informed,
is not forgoing a treatment that has a better potential for success, and
is not exposing himself or herself to needless risk, I (and many physicians)
will help the patient gain access to that treatment. I have certainly recommended
alternative medical treatments for several of my patients with AIDS and,
frankly, I am glad that I did; however, marijuana is neither an acceptable
medical treatment nor an alternative medical treatment for any illness.
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>BUT MARIJUANA CAN RELIEVE CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA; ISN'T
THAT AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM? </CENTER>
</H3>
When one of my patients has a cancer problem that can be helped by treatment
with chemotherapy medications, I will recommend that we proceed with treatment.
Many of these drugs have serious side effects that we must take into consideration
and be prepared to manage. Often, I will also recommend the use of medications
to alleviate symptoms caused by the cancer (such as the judicious use of
narcotic medications for the relief of pain). I will also use medications
to relieve the symptoms caused by chemotherapy treatments, such as nausea.
<BR>
<BR>
Whenever I recommend that a patient undergo chemotherapy treatment, I always
make sure that we have a lot of time to discuss the effects of a particular
treatment and how they will be managed. I find that the word &quot;chemotherapy&quot;
usually evokes a lot of anxiety. People facing the prospect of chemotherapy
invariably know of someone who underwent cancer treatment and suffered a
great deal of discomfort. The most frightening symptom that people associate
with chemotherapy is not pain, but rather uncontrollable nausea and vomiting.
While this is not a problem with many types of chemotherapy treatments,
it has been common enough over the years to give rise to a lot of legitimate
fear. The good news is that within the last 10 years, safe and effective
treatments for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting have made this fear
a thing of the past. <BR>
<H3><CENTER>IS THERE EVER A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH MARIJUANA IS THE BEST
AVAILABLE TREATMENT FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING? </CENTER>
</H3>
I never recommend that my patients use marijuana. I want to explain why
in the most balanced and compassionate way I can. To understand why I feel
the way I do, it is important to understand some of the medical details
about chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. <BR>
<BR>
Chemotherapy drugs cause nausea by stimulating an area of the brain called
the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Typically, nausea and vomiting begin 90
minutes to three hours after the administration of the chemotherapy and
can last for up to six hours. For certain chemotherapy medications, such
as platinum and intravenous cyclophosphamide, the onset of nausea may be
delayed for up to 18 hours and may have a somewhat more prolonged course
of up to four days. <BR>
<BR>
Patients whose nausea and vomiting have been poorly controlled can become
conditioned into developing anticipatory nausea, which can begin even before
the treatment begins. Since there are several different chemical receptors
in the brain which control the sensation of nausea, several different types
of drugs have proven effective in its treatment. All of these medications
need only be used for very limited periods of time. <BR>
<BR>
The most successful group of anti-nausea drugs has been the recently introduced
medications which block serotonin receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger
zone, such as ondansetron. These medications have proven to be safe and
effective for both adults and children and generally have only mild side
effects. <BR>
<BR>
Another group of drugs which has proven safe and effective for the treatment
of chemotherapy-induced vomiting are medications which block dopamine receptors,
such as metoclopramide and haloperidol. Other dopamine-blocking medications
as the phenothiazine medications (which include Thorazine and Compazine)
are somewhat effective but are inferior and remain &quot;third choice&quot;
medications. <BR>
<BR>
Other medications, such as certain steroids and minor tranquilizers, have
proven safe and effective for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting, usually when used in conjunction with another anti-nausea
drug. <BR>
<H3><CENTER>WHAT ABOUT DRUGS DERIVED FROM MARIJUANA? </CENTER>
</H3>
A class of drugs derived from marijuana called the cannabinoids has also
been shown to have some anti-nausea effects, but this activity is no greater
than that of third-choice drugs. <BR>
<BR>
Cannabinoids also cause more side effects than the other anti-nausea drugs
(sedation, dizziness, low blood pressure, and an unpleasant sensation called
dysphoria). A purified form of the cannabinoid Delta-9 THC has been available
on the American market for eight years under the brand name Marinol. Despite
its availability it has found limited use, because it generally doesn't
work. If you look at the advertisements for Marinol placed in the medical
journals by its manufacturer (Roxane Laboratories), it is touted as &quot;more
effective than Compazine,&quot; which is a third-choice medication for the
treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. <BR>
<H3><CENTER>IS MARIJUANA MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE DERIVATIVES THAT ARE CURRENTLY
ON THE MARKET? </CENTER>
</H3>
Every few years, the lay press brings up the issue of using inhaled marijuana
for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea. For physicians, this issue
was settled 10 years ago when Dr. M. Levitt and colleagues conducted a randomized
double-blind comparison of Delta-9 THC and marijuana for the treatment of
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. (This is published in the 1984
Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, volume 3, page
91.) What they found was that neither agent was particularly useful (75
percent of patients in both groups suffered significant nausea and vomiting),
and among patients expressing a preference, Delta-9 THC was chosen the best
agent. Inhaled marijuana has nothing to add to the limited benefits of purified
Delta-9 THC. It does carry added risks due to its method of delivery and
its impurity. This includes toxic effects on the lungs, additional side
effects, and the danger of infection from fungus which is often found in
marijuana cigarettes. Marijuana is never the best available treatment for
a patient, and that is why it is not a medication. <BR>
<H3><CENTER>IF MARIJUANA ISN'T A MEDICATION, WHY AREN'T PHYSICIANS UP IN
ARMS ABOUT THE CURRENT MOVEMENT TO LEGALIZE ITS USE FOR CANCER PATIENTS?
</CENTER>
</H3>
Most physicians are unaware that this is really an issue; for them the issue
was settled years ago. Years ago, when there were no effective medications
on the market for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,
the American Medical Association considered the therapeutic potentials and
hazards of marijuana. As they examined its emerging therapeutic possibilities,
they found more and more evidence that marijuana was hazardous to health.
(Journal of the AMA, Oct. 16, 1981, volume 246, pages 1823-1827.) <BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, many physicians (including me) had patients who participated
in treatment trials using inhaled marijuana in the late 70s and early 80s
because, at the time, there was no better alternative. With the therapeutic
potential of marijuana eclipsed by safer and more effective drugs, we have
come to the conclusion that there is no therapeutic use for marijuana. All
we are left with are the hazards. These include lung disease, cardiac dysfunction,
brain damage, genetic damage, immune disorders and psychomotor impairment.
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>HOW CAN PHYSICIANS' NON-RESPONSE TO THE ISSUE OF THE MEDICINAL
USE OF MARIJUANA BE EXPLAINED? </CENTER>
</H3>
I have to admit that when I was first confronted with the issue of &quot;medical
marijuana&quot; by my friends in the prevention field, I couldn't get very
excited about it. I felt that the facts obviously showed that there was
no medicinal use for inhaled marijuana and, as such, it was not a subject
worthy of serious concern. As I mentioned to a friend, I classed the medical
use of marijuana right up there with the issue of therapeutic bathing in
Drano! I was against that too, but I couldn't see that anybody could seriously
be in favor of it. <BR>
<H3><CENTER>HASN'T THERE BEEN RECENT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT MARIJUANA
CAN BE USEFUL AS A MEDICATION? </CENTER>
</H3>
If you look up &quot;marijuana&quot; in the last few years of the journal
used by most clinical oncologists (Journal of Clinical Oncology) you'll
find only one mention of marijuana (a sign that it's not a hot topic for
us). That mention is made in an article by Richard Doblin and Mark Kleiman,
of Harvard University, that reports a survey that they conducted of physicians
and that purports to &quot;suggest that support for rescheduling marijuana
is indeed present in at least a significant minority of our population (oncologists).&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
The report, which appears in the Journal of Clinical Oncology volume 9,
pages 1314-1319, does not mention how the authors selected doctors to respond
to their survey, and it also doesn't mention the authors' affiliation with
any of the pro-marijuana organizations to which they belong (no bias there?).
While this article did not have much of an impact on oncologists, mention
of it was made in letters to many medical journals -- letters written by
Doblin and Kleiman. <BR>
<BR>
These letters were generally ignored by physicians. This would almost be
funny if all these references weren't being used by pro-marijuana forces
to convince ill-informed government officials that there is medical evidence
to support the use of marijuana. <BR>
<H3><CENTER>WHAT ABOUT THE BOOK ON MARIJUANA WRITTEN BY A PROFESSOR AT HARVARD
MEDICAL SCHOOL? </CENTER>
</H3>
Another source cited as evidence of the therapeutic effects of marijuana
is a book that was recently written by Dr. Lester Grinspoon of the Harvard
Medical School (&quot;Marihuana, the Forbidden Medicine&quot;). The book
is poorly written, unscientific, and makes some absolutely bizarre claims
for the use of marijuana. (For example, Dr. G. says it promotes safe driving!)
<BR>
<BR>
Many people in the prevention field were justifiably angered when they read
this book. I read the book, and I found it very disturbing. I must say that
my predominant emotional reaction was to feel sorry for Dr. Grinspoon. <BR>
<BR>
Dr. Grinspoon was obviously moved to write this book because of his experience
with his young son Danny. Danny had leukemia, and his treatments caused
severe nausea and vomiting that did not respond to the medications that
were available at that time. Danny could barely tolerate his chemotherapy
treatments, and I'm, sure that his parents could barely stand to watch him
suffer. Nonetheless, they must have thought that the chemotherapy treatments
held some potential benefit for Danny, so they urged him to continue. <BR>
<BR>
In 1971, Danny found that smoking marijuana helped him tolerate his treatments.
His doctors, feeling that this was the best available treatment, supported
Danny's smoking and conducted research which eventually led to the development
of Marinol. Dr. Grinspoon writes that, during the remaining year of his
life, Danny used marijuana before his chemotherapy treatments and because
of his marijuana use, Danny and his parents were all much more comfortable.
Because of this, Dr. Grinspoon must have some strong positive associations
with marijuana, and he has become an advocate for its use as a medication.
<BR>
<BR>
Marijuana is not a medication. Marijuana was a medication when Danny used
it. At the time it was the best available treatment, and he used it in a
medical, life-affirming way. He did not use it to escape his life. He used
it to help him undergo treatment so that he could continue his life. <BR>
<BR>
I am sure that Dr. Grinspoon would not recommend that people undergo the
same leukemia treatment that Danny underwent over 20 years ago. There are
now new treatments that are more effective and safer. (These days most children
with the type of leukemia that Danny had are cured.) I think that the same
holds true for Danny's anti-nausea treatment. These days, no oncologist
would recommend marijuana, because there are safer and more effective treatments.
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>IS MEDICAL MARIJUANA A SERIOUS ISSUE?</CENTER>
</H3>
The thing that really frightens me is that some people will use Dr. Grinspoon's
tragedy to construct an even larger tragedy. I worry that the well-financed
advocates of the recreational use of marijuana -- e.g. the people that want
to sell it to my kids -- are using this wedge of false medical evidence
to open the door for the legalization and wider recreational use of marijuana.
The glibness with which our new (and obviously uninformed) Surgeon General
has come out in favor of using inhaled marijuana is scary and shows that
even some doctors (though I'm sure it's very few) don't always think before
they speak. This is a serious issue, and I am worried that most doctors
won't get involved until it is too late. <BR>
