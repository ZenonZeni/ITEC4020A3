<ul>  
<li>A ground-based beacon called "DORIS" sends radio signals to a satellite receiver that measures the "Doppler." The "Doppler effect" is what causes the distinctive sound pattern you hear when a car passes. The distance between your ear and the car changes as it passes and so does the frequency of the sound waves generated by the car;</li><br> 
<li>Light from ground-based lasers is reflected off mirrors on the T/P satellite; and</li><br> 
<li>The Global Positioning System (GPS) network is used. At times, a T/P receiver tracks several GPS satellites simultaneously and, because the position of GPS satellites is well-known, T/P's position can be calculated. This was originally only an experiment but is now a very reliable data source.</li><br>
