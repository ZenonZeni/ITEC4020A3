Deramp

<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Deramp removes the phase signal generated by the curvature of the Earth.  At
ASF, we call this correcting for the flat Earth model.  Imagine hovering in a
helicopter and dropping a string to the ground.  The length of the string will
be <b>X</b>.  Now pretend a child on a bicycle picks up the end of the string
and starts to ride with it.  The further the child rides, the longer the string
becomes.  If we call the new length <b>Y</b>, then <b>Y &gt; X</b>.  This
increase in string length is equal to the increase in the path a SAR signal
travels as it scans an area.  Now, you must also factor the curvature of the
Earth.  The farther out the child or signal goes, the increase in effect caused
by the Earth curving away from the satellite.  deramp corrects for this effect.
<P>
In order to perform these calculations, deramp needs a baseline file.  You can
either use the baseline file created by <a href="resolve.html">resolve</a>,
create your own, or use published values (i.e.  ESA publishes baseline values
for the ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites).
<P>
Deramp also needs to access the metadata file for the source image.  The source
image is usually the first image in the interferometric pair.  If you are unsure
which image is the source image, the image which was passed as the first
argument to <a href="resolve.html">resolve</a> is the source image.  (<I>Note:
The source image is usually the image acquired first.  You can check the
facility data record to find this information.</I>)
<P>
The phase file required by deramp is the phase file created by <a
href="igram.html">igram</a>.  If you have been following the examples, you have
all the necessary files.  You are ready to run deramp.

<DT><H2>Example</H2></DT>
<DD>
For details on the command line syntax, please see the <a 
href="http://www.images.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/man-request.pl?asftool=deramp&amp;sec
tion=1">man page</a>.
<P>
A sample run looks like the following:
<P><PRE>
sparc1k [51]: deramp asc12 asc1 base.0 asc12d
H = 7155344.500000

starting in-place deramp of input data 

Done with line 11520 of 12800
Done with deramp

Total wall clock time = 86 seconds.
</PRE><P>
Note that the line <I>Done with line...</I> will update as each line is 
finished.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Description</H2></DT>
<DD>
Using the interferometric phase file, which was created by <a 
href="igram.html">igram</a> from the asc1 and asc2 phase files, deramp attempts 
to correct for the flat Earth model. Deramp reads the necessary baseline 
information from the file <b>base.0</b> which was created by <a 
href="resolve.html">resolve</a>.
<P>
The necessary information for calculating the curvature of the Earth comes from
the metadata of the source image, <b>asc1</b>.  You must use the metadata from
the source image because the the target image has been shifted to overlay on top
of the source image.  If you use the metadata for the target image, the
calculations for the Earth curvature will be misaligned with the interferogram.
<P>
The output phase, <b>asc12d.phase</b> should be used for the rest of the 
programs in these examples. The only time you need to revert back to the 
original interferometric phase file is when deramp is run again.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
The next step in interferometry processing is <a href="ml.html">ml</a>. Ml will 
multilook our phase and amplitude file. It will also combine them to produce a 
colorized interferogram which uses the amplitude to determine brightness.
