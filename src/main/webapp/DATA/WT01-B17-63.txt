<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Poisons from Your Mouth: The Dangerous, Uncontrolled Mercury-Leaking
Dental Amalgam Story</CENTER></H2>

<P>"I certify that dental mercury amalgam which contains up to 50 percent
mercury is 'absolutely safe.'" 

<P>So reads an unsigned certificate published and
distributed by one progressive dentist. The intent is for people to bring this
message to their own dentist as a test. If the dentist won't sign, we know
he/she doesn't believe that mercury amalgam is safe. If the certificate is
signed, you have a weapon to use when amalgam is finally designated as harmful
by mainstream dentists.
<P>
<HR>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>How dare the patient imply that material used for fillings foe the last 150 years 
is anything but safe!</CENTER></H3>
<HR>

<P>     Some time back, my dentist expected that kind ofstuff from me, and he would
simply laugh it off. (I use a different dentist now.) It is not known how much
weight this declaration would have as a legal instrument, but the reactions of
most dentists to such a challenge from a patient can range from polite rejection
to open hostility. How <I>dare</I> the patient imply that material used for fillings
for the last 150 years is anything but safe! 

<P>One would think this long history
of apparently successful use would be strong evidence of mercury amalgam's
total safety. In the face of mounting evidence ofthe dangers of mercury
products, however, the century and a half of use has created an established
tradition that resists change with astonishing inertia. The fact is that, in
spite ofthe pandemic use of amalgam, most dentists and doctors are ignorant
about the level of mercury exposure and its very harmful health implications.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Most dentists and doctors are ignorant about the level of mercury exposure and

<HR>

<P>     Mercury is a simple substance, mixed for dental use on the spot, as needed.
About half the finished product going into your mouth is comprised of liquid
mercury. The other half contains powdered silver, tin alloy, copper, and zinc.
The mixture appears to have the perfect mechanical and chemical properties for
the job of filling cavities. 
<A NAME="supero"> </A>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>So what's the problem?</CENTER></H3>

Mercury is chemically
related to cadmium and zinc, although it is much heavier than the other two
elements. After iron, zinc is perhaps the most important of the trace elements.
Zinc can be classed as an antioxidant, largely because it plays a key role in
the enzyme <I>superoxide dismutase</I> (SOD). This is the primary line of defense
against oxidation damage. SOD is an oxygen scavenger, a first step in a process
that is complex but highly protective. Without the protection of SOD, the fat
content in the thin membrane encircling every cell in your body would be
oxidized. This results in the alteration of each cell, compromising its
function. Cellular proteins and DNA would be damaged. Enzymes would be
"neutralized," shutting down cell respiration-which is essentially the same as
killing the cell. 

<P>Mercury not only damages cell membranes but also affects your
nervous system and is generally regarded as an <I>immunosuppressant</I>. Mercury
compromises, inhibits, or destroys the protective activity of SOD and other
enzymes.


<P>
<HR>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Bacteria in the stomach and intestine can also convert mercury to this hazardous form</CENTER></H3>
<HR>

<P>
It's amazing how a substance like mercury, which is difficult to absorb,
can be converted to a form that is easily assimilated-a process that occurs when
you chew. Methyl mercury is produced by bacteria exposed to the mercury on the
surface of a dental amalgam and is considered extremely dangerous. Other
bacteria in the stomach and intestine can also convert mercury to this hazardous
form. 

<UL>There are several mechanisms by which mercury can be released and
transported:
<LI><B>Vapor release.</B> The discovery in 1979 that the simple act of
chewing food releases mercury vapor from mercury amalgam fillings rang the
first alarm bells. This led to the initial series of studies linking amalgam
fillings to blood and tissue levels of mercury. 
<LI><B>Galvanic corrosion</B> is another
release mechanism, especially if two or more different mixes of amalgam are in
close proximity. The slight differences of the two materials can actually
produce a measurable electric current, resulting in amalgam ions being released
into saliva. When swallowed, a small but significant portion of the mercury
is absorbed. 
<LI><B>Abrasion</B> (scraping or rubbing). Physical abrasion of the
filling is a third route that mercury can take from the filling to your tissue.
Abrasion also removes the protective film surface. Chewing, bruxism (teeth
grinding during sleep), eating very hot or acidic food, and even tooth brushing
all contribute to abrasion. One study demonstrated that amalgam fillings in
sheep led to rapid deterioration of kidney function, among other disorders. The
study was widely publicized by the television program <I>60 Minutes</I> in 1990.</UL>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
<BR>is
the primary line of defense 
<BR>against oxidation damage.</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
Another study revealed the following amounts of mercury vapor released under
these circumstances: 35 micrograms (per cubic meter) with unstimulated emission;
70 micrograms released when you chew food or gum; 270 when you brush your
teeth; 500 after a hygienic cleaning; 600 after having your teeth polished with
water spray; and 4,000 when teeth are polished dry, with no water!
<P>
To what
extent does the amount of mercury present in something as small as a tooth
filling represent a real hazard? In laboratory tests, cell death has been
reported at concentrations from 0.2 to 12 parts per million. That's between
13.6 and 816 milligrams, distributed evenly over a 150-pound body. In
reality, mercury is likely to accumulate in certain organs, allowing a
much higher concentration to develop from a smaller supply. Nerve cells
sustain damage from mercury at only 0.1 parts per million, and in one study,
cells were destroyed when exposed to only 2 parts per billion of methyl
mercury for only one hour. That's 0.002 ppm, or 0.14 micrograms in 150
pounds of tissue!

<P>

So you see that mercury amalgam fillings are essentially
time capsules that release a continuing supply of mercury in more than ample
quantities to maintain trace concentrations in your body. Mercury has been
implicated in multiple sclerosis, in reduced immune cell (T-lymphocyte)
activity, birth defects, miscarriages, and a host of neurological
disorders. One study suggests that amalgam mercury may be a factor in
depression, excessive anger, and anxiety-because mercury can produce such
symptoms, perhaps by affecting the neurotransmitters in the brain.2 (A
neurotransmitter is a chemical agent that carries signals from nerve to
nerve.) Female dental assistants are less fertile than unexposed controls.3 And
how ironic that mercury can play a major role in the deteriorating process
ofgingivitis and periodontal disease.4 Are dentists paying attention?

<HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>An
interesting research project looked at the smoking habits of people without
mercury dental fillings as compared to those with amalgams. The amalgam group
had 2.5-times more smokers per group than the non-amalgam group-a highly
significant difference. 

<P>The results of a study reported in Scandinavia indicate
that removal of amalgam can be very helpful in reducing lesions of the mouth.
The stimulus causing the lesions? Mercury from corroding amalgam fillings!

<P>The American Dental Association (ADA) had always maintained that no mercury ever
came out ofan amalgam filling. Confronted with evidence to the contrary, the
organization eventually acknowledged that an "insignificant" amount of
mercury is in fact released over time. 

<P>In 1987, the Swedish Health Board
determined that amalgam was unsuitable for use as a dental filling material
due to its toxicity. Our ADA described the finding as "bogus." Then in 1988, the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified removed dental
amalgam scrap as a hazardous material. The most important polluting materials
are the heavy metals, with mercury near the top ofthe list. Detailed guidelines
for the special handling of this toxic waste must by law be available in every
dentist's office. There's a hefty fine for allowing a scrap ofthis stuff to go
down the drain or into the solid waste stream. But it's perfectly okay to store
it in your mouth!

<P>It's
interesting to note that in 1989 Denmark followed suit with a ban on the
importation, sale, and use of all products containing mercury. Enforcement of
this ban, however, has not yet occurred due to "procedural" problems. The
pressure is on, however. The largest manufacturer of mercury amalgam
fillings in Europe has closed its doors.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Mercury is likely to accumulate

<BR>concentration to develop from a smaller supply.</CENTER></H3>
<HR WIDTH=90%>

<P>Some dental associations have taken
the position that any dentist who removes amalgam fillings for the purpose of
eliminating a possible source of mercury toxicity is guilty of a "breach of
ethics." But note that it's still perfectly okay to remove an amalgam filling
to replace it with a more expensive one for cosmetic reasons. Yes, that's
right. This is from an advertising campaign waged by the Alaska State Dental
Association in 1989, attempting to head off the tide of public concern about
mercury amalgams. It's also interesting to note that mercury fillings have been
banned in Germany for pregnant women. 

<P>Now the ADA has retreated to the
position that  "there is no scientifically documented evidence of a cure or
improvement of a specific disease due to the removal of amalgam...." 

<P>Fine. The
damage is nonspecific, incurable, and the accounts of improved health, ranging
from subtle to dramatic, are all nonscientific. Suppose I accept that. Does that
mean I still want the stuff in my mouth? Not after I have looked at the studies.

<P>Public awareness and legislative action march on, despite the ADA. In December
of 1993, Jeneric/Pentron, Inc., a manufacturer of amalgam, agreed to include a
consumer warning label with their product. This was in response to a suit
brought against them under California's toxicity warning laws. The label reads:

<P><B>Warning: This dental office uses amalgam filling materials which contain and
will expose patients who use them to mercury, a chemical known to the State of
California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm. Please consult
your dentist for more information.</B> 

<P>Are dentists taking this warning
seriously? In the face of compelling evidence, some practitioners will
adapt to the new knowledge, while others will continue to fall back on the
century of ignorance. Meanwhile, California is the only state demanding that
manufacturers of mercury-amalgam fillings note on its labels that high
levels can cause damage. I called a dozen dentists in California and asked if
they impart this information to their patients. None said they did! Is your
dentist sharing this information with you? 

<P>And there's one more fundamental
problem. Although we address dentists as "doctor" in this country, they really
aren't trained as doctors-not in the common understanding of that awareness.
Their area of training is limited. Not so in other parts of the world, where
dentistry is a specialization of medical practice, on a par with other
specialties. Dentists in Europe earn the title of doctor-but "biological
dentistry" in the United States is still considered to be out on the fringe.

<BR>The <I>Holistic
Dental Digest</I> suggests that today's high-tech can be carried too far. "If a
regular toothbrush can cause abrasion ofthe root surface and recession ofthe
gums, think what you can do with one that adds that sort ofvibration energy to
the equation," reports the <I>Dental Digest</I>. It recommends the Rota-Dent, which has
filaments rather than bristles. The filaments are finer than human hair. Each
Rota-Dent tip contains 5,600 filaments in it-a tip that has a diameter of about
1/4 inch. This gives them the ability to clean without abrading. The shape of
the tip eases itself in between the teeth and under the gum line to remove
plaque thoroughly and gently.
