<h1>Democratic Values for a Digital Age </h1>
<P>
<h2>1995 Activities of the <br>

Center for Democracy and Technology 
<P>
February 1995</h2></center><p><hr size = 6><p>

<h2>I.  Overview</h2>

<P>
The Center for Democracy and Technology is an independent, non-profit
public interest policy organization in Washington, DC. The Center's
mission is to develop and implement public policies to protect
and advance individual liberty and democratic values in new digital
media. The Center achieves its goals through policy development,
public education, and coalition building. 
<P>
With the rapid growth of new media including the Internet, interactive
television networks and multimedia information services, many
proponents emphasize their potential to increase entertainment,
commerce, and education.  Pundits and policy makers also assure
us that free speech and privacy will be preserved and our democratic
institutions strengthened by new communication opportunities.
But little actual attention is devoted to assuring that democracy
and constitutional values are protected and enhanced by digital
media.
<P>
The Center for Democracy and Technology has been founded to advance
these values in the public policy debates over the evolving communications
infrastructure. The Center will strive to achieve its goals by
working with public interest groups, the communications and computer
industry, and policy makers of all political persuasions to build
coalitions in support of practical policies and solutions . The
Center, founded by Jerry Berman, Janlori Goldman, and Daniel Weitzner,
marshals legal, technical, and public policy expertise on behalf
of civil liberties goals, including:
<P>
<B>Maximizing free speech and the free flow of information in
on-line and interactive media:  </B>
<P>
Interactive media, unlike mass media, feature abundant bandwidth,
diverse programming, and increased control by users over programming
they  receive and information with which they interact. These
characteristics of new  media increasingly undermine past rationales
and future effectiveness of  government speech content restrictions
which have dominated the mass media.  Interactive media requires
alternative, less intrusive, means-often relying on  technology
rather than content regulation-for achieving public ends. 
<P>
<i>Critical Free Speech Issues in 1995:</i>
<UL>
<LI>Exon Amendment: extending indecency liability to all online
services;
<LI>Third Party liability for intellectual property infringement.
</UL>

<P>
<P>
The Center will oppose government efforts to impose limits on
free speech in interactive information services and work with
the private sector and policy makers to investigate and develop
alternative policy and technology options  which meet legitimate
government objectives without limiting constitutionally protected
free speech or stultifying the potential of new media to maximize
content diversity. 
<P>
<B>Giving citizens more control over sensitive personal information:
 </B>
<P>
The Center believes that the use of personal information about
citizens to conduct  transactions in electronic media pose threats
to individual privacy.  At  the same  time, new technology may
help citizens better control the use of information about  themselves.
 The Center will work with privacy advocates, the business and
 communications industry, and public policy makers to develop
self regulatory and public policy solutions to strengthen fair
information practices and explore ways in which interactive technologies
can increase citizen control over the use of  personal information
held by government and other third party institutions.
<P>
<i>Critical Information Privacy Issues in 1995</i>
<UL>
<LI>Access to public records;\Health information privacy;
<LI>Online service transactional records access.
<LI>Protecting communications privacy in a global network environment:
</UL>
<P>
<B>Enhancing communications privacy in digital environments</B>
<P>
With increased reliance on digital communications for sensitive
personal, political, and financial information, the Center believes
that  the law must be constantly updated to protect communications
privacy. But laws are not enough. The availability of privacy-protecting
technology is critical to enable individuals and institutions
to protect their privacy.  The Center will work to assure that
there is broad access to encryption technology, and will continue
to insure that the privacy of personal communications are legally
protected from unauthorized access. 
<P>
<i>Critical Digital Privacy Issues in 1995:</i>
<UL>
<LI>Encryption export controls;
<LI>Digital Telephony bill implementation before the FCC;
<LI>Clipper alternatives and private key escrow proposals.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>Guaranteeing public access to electronic government information:</B>  
<P>
New computer and communication technologies can enhance public
access to government information.  However, the Freedom of Information
Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, and other access statutes predate
the PC revolution. The Center will work to reform these laws to
expand the public's right to know in the digital age. 
<P>
<i>Critical Information Access Issues in 1995:</i>
<UL>
<LI>Electronic Freedom of Information Act amendments (EFOIA);
<LI>Paperwork Reduction Act amendments.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Identifying network architecture that serve democratic values
</B>: 
<P>
The national and international information infrastructure is
growing rapidly, but is still in very early stages of deployment.
The Center believes that the design choices made now will have
a critical impact on the free speech, access, and privacy. The
Center will monitor technology trends to identify network developments
which contribute to universal digital access and other democratic
goals.<p><hr size = 6><p>  
<a name="2"></a><H2>II. Summary of 1995 Activities</H2>

<P>
The Center for Democracy and Technology plans to work on privacy,
security, free speech, access to public information, and open
network issues by conducting the following projects. 
<p>
<b>A. Protecting Communications Privacy: The Digital Privacy and Security Working Group Project
</B>
<P>
The Center will coordinate the Digital Privacy and Security Working
Group (DPSWG), a coalition of over 50 computer, communications,
and civil liberties organizations and associations working on
communications privacy and security issues.  
<P>
The Center, on its own and through the DPSWG, will vigorously
monitor the implementation of the newly enacted Digital Telephony
Statute, &quot;The Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement
Act of 1994.&quot;  The law contains procedures that permit privacy
organizations and industry to intervene at the FCC with respect
to standards setting, cost reimbursement, and privacy protection
issues.  The Center will work to insure that the spirit and intent
of the bill are adhered to and use every opportunity to enforce
public accountability by requiring the government to reimburse
industry for the cost of meeting statutory wiretap capability
and capacity requirements.  
<P>
In addition, the Center will continue to oppose mandatory government
escrowed encryption.  Despite the recently  announced reexamination
of policy, the Clinton Administration has made it clear that it
intends to pursue government escrowed encryption, rigid, secret
national cryptography standards, and ongoing export controls on
encryption which pose significant impediments to privacy and innovation
in digital media. The Center and the  DPSWG will form a task force
to study and report on the privacy and security implications of
public key private, non-governmental escrow systems. 
<P>
In its  effort to end export controls on cryptography, the Center
will state its views in the context of the National Research Council's
study. The Center will present its input through briefings, presentations,
consultations, and testimony at regional public hearings.  The
Center will also work with DPSWG members to educate the new Congress
on these critical security and privacy issues.</ul>
<P>
<B>B. Safeguarding Personal Information in the Digital Age: The
Privacy Forum Project</B>
<P>
The Center will conduct an ongoing Privacy Forum to serve as a
common meeting ground for public interest groups and business
organizations who want to explore policy options for resolving
transactional and database privacy issues  posed by new technologies.

<P>
The Forum will bring together key privacy, consumer and business
interests on an on-going basis to explore issues based on a mutual
commitment to find solutions that strike a balance between privacy
and fair information practices and other important public interests,
including: 
<UL><p>
<LI>access to public information; 
<LI>free speech and the free flow of information;
<LI>maximizing consumer choice;
<LI>fostering  business innovation in the information economy,
and; 
<LI>the development of a multimedia information superhighway.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The Privacy Forum's agenda includes studying ways to balance the
competing privacy, First Amendment and economic interests posed
 by recent initiatives to restrict access to and use of public
records such as motor vehicle registrations, voting records, and
real estate transactions.
<P>
The Privacy Forum will also identify problems and solutions regarding
the privacy of transactional information created and used in the
conduct of electronic commerce, politics, and entertainment over
telephone, cable, and wireless networks. 
<P>
The Privacy Forum will also work with the online service providers,
including America Online, Compuserve, Delphi, Ziff-Davis Interactive,
Interchange Online Network, civil liberties groups, and privacy
experts to  develop model self-regulatory consumer privacy policies
for interactive services. The issues will be developed through
research and explored in depth at an all day consultation in the fall of 1995.
<P>
The Privacy Forum will also explore new technology driven means
for enforcing and abiding by fair information practices.  The
Forum will meet to discuss how interactive technology can give
citizens new means for &quot;filtering&quot; or &quot;opting out&quot;
and correcting, which at the same time providing  businesses with
more accurate and relevant information about who wants to receive
specific products and services.In addition to the Privacy Forum,
the Center will continue its work on Health Care Privacy Reform
sponsored by the Hartford Foundation.</ul><p> 
<b>C. Protecting Free Speech: The Interactive Working Group Project</b>

<P>
The Center will organize and  coordinate the work of the Interactive
Working Group in 1995. The IWG is a Center effort to bring together
major on-line service providers (America On-line, Compuserve,
AT&amp;T Interactive, Delphi, Prodigy), new entrants into interactive
services such as telephone and cable companies, and public interest
groups  to work together to develop policies and guidelines designed
to maximize First Amendment values, privacy, commerce, and innovation
 rapidly developing interactive on-line media. 
<P>
The introduction of legislation by Senators Exon and Conrad and
others to limit indecent and violent programming in interactive
and cable networks underscore the importance of establishing a
working group to explore alternatives and less intrusive means
for achieving public ends without violating free speech. 
<P>
The Center, working with the IWG, will prepare a white paper,
conduct meetings and conferences, and engage in public education
on behalf of the IWG, to lay the groundwork for an alternative
to content restrictions in new interactive media.  The white paper
will:
<UL><p>
<LI>explain that interactive media, as contrasted with traditional
broadcast media, will be characterized by an abundance of content
carried over potentially unlimited numbers of communications paths;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>demonstrate that  traditional content restrictions, designed
to be enforced by network content providers, are going to be difficult
if not impossible to police or make effective without severely
restricting the free flow of information; 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>show the ability and potential of the new interactive media
to increase user (especially parental) control over the content
of media received into the home; and 
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>advocate that rather than the government enforcing community
standards, each citizen should be afforded the opportunity and
ability to choose or self-select programming consistent with their
own particularized community standards and values. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The Center and the IWG will outline a regulatory model for non-mass
media interactive services which (a) permits interactive service
providers to transmit, without liability, all lawful content,
commercial or non-commercial, provided that they  (b) clearly
identify the nature of the programming (adult, tobacco sponsored,
general viewing, etc.) and  provide subscribers  user-friendly
means for making viewer choices for themselves and their children.
<P></ul>
<B>D. Expanding the Public Right to Know: The Electronic Public
Information  Project</B>
<P>
This year Congress will again take up legislation to establish
a right of access to the electronic version of public information
by amending the Freedom of Information Act.  Congress will also
consider amendments to the Paperwork Reduction Act, which has
important implications for governmental dissemination obligations,
and the balance between reliance on public, versus private access
options.
<P>
The Center, together with public interest groups, the information
industry, and press organizations, will work to expand public
access to electronic government information.</ul> 
<P>
<B>E. Open Networks: Network Architecture and Democracy Study
Project.</B>
<P>
As the public policy debate about the National Information Infrastructure
continues, the Center, working with non-profits, and others who
share free speech and diversity goals, will strive to expand and
enlighten the debate over the relationship between various network
architecture options and democratic values.  The Center believes
there is a critical need for independent research and analysis
which reflects on the health, vitality, and growth of networks.
Critical technology options are often overlooked by both policy
makers and public interest organizations because the sources of
technical information are generally limited to the very network
owners and operators who are the subject of any given policy debate.
 If the NII is to be a true open platform, public policy must
be guided by independent technology assessment undertaken with
open network goals in mind.
<P>
The Center's Network Architecture and Democracy Study Project
 will track and analyze technology and market trends in the growth
networks.  The Center study will be undertaken in consultation
with public interest organizations such as the Benton Foundation,
the Consumer Federation of America, People for the American Way,
the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Progress and Freedom
Foundation. The Project will strive to facilitate a dialogue between
the public interest community, the communications and computer
industry, and policy makers on open network goals. 
<P>
When the 104th Congress consider telecommunications legislation,
the Center will be at the core of the debate over the public interest
in the development of the Information Infrastructure.  Center
staff, all of whom have had substantial involvement in the telecommunications
debate over the last several years, will monitor the legislative
developments to assure that the following values are served:<p>
<UL>
<LI>Affordable access to high-speed, switched, digital services
available at nondiscriminatory rates and terms;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Nationwide access to interconnected network services for rural
and urban areas alike.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The Center will also work with other public interest organizations
and industry groups to identify options for insuring continued
access to non-commercial programming and information sources.
<P>
<h2><a name="3"></a>III. Funding</h2>
<P>
The Center is a 501&#169;(3) (application pending) organization
and receives funding from individuals, foundations, and a representative
cross-section of the communications and computer industry.<p>
