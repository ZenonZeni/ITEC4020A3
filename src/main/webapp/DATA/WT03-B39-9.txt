UNITED STATES:  AT&T CUTS APR TO DRUM UP BUSINESS

AT&T UNIVERSAL Card has cut the APR from 18.15 percent to 13.9 percent
for a selected swathe of its customer base in an effort to transform
convenience users into borrowers - at least during the holiday season
and in time to affect the 1996 bottom line.

"We have a significant number of transactors who have the potential to
become revolvers," said Robbie Kolakowski, vice-president of portfolio
marketing for AT&T Universal, based in Jacksonville, Florida. "We want
to become the card of choice in our cardholders' wallets."

The move comes at an especially important time for AT&T, both
corporately and in the card unit itself. AT&T Universal suffered a
charge-off rate of 6 percent, adding up to a $39 million loss, during
the third quarter of 1996. It was largely in anticipation of this
disappointing result that unit president David Hunt resigned late last
summer (see Cards International 163).

More recently, and on the heels of Universal Card's disappointing third
quarter, AT&T chairman Robert Allen named John Walter president, chief
operating officer and chief executive of the telecommunications giant.
The appointment prompted renewed industry speculation that AT&T will
seek to spin off or simply sell the Universal Card portfolio.

"It is certainly not going to surprise anyone if it does go on the
block," said an industry observer. As for the rate cut itself, few
think other issuers will respond.

"It has that sort of scent to it; a desperation move," said Bruce
Brittain, president of Brittain Associates, an Atlanta-based market
research firm. "It has just not been terribly successful in getting
revolvers."

According to Brittain, the industry average for revolving a balance
from one month to another is 60 percent, while on the AT&T card it is
39 percent. "And it was 39 percent in the third quarter of last year,
so it hasn't seen any improvement," he added.

"It is true that we have a large share of transactors," Kolakowski
said, "but we can rely on our AT&T relationship to make that a
profitable relationship." Speaking of the rate cut, she said, "We do
expect it to have a positive effect in 1996."

Kolakowski expected more aggressive marketing from AT&T Universal in
the near term, and described the card unit's strategy as twofold.

"We are aggressively pursuing strategies to control our losses, and all
our marketing programmes are going to concentrate on getting a greater
share of cardholders' wallets." Controlling losses, she said, would be
mainly a matter of tightening credit standards: "We have sliced
acquisitions in 1996."

While AT&T Universal is the world's third largest card issuer in number
of cards in circulation, behind Dean Witter, Discover and Citicorp with
24 cards and 18 million accounts respectively, it is seventh in
receivables.

UNITED KINGDOM:  RETAILER MOVES INTO BANKING

UK SUPERMARKET group Sainsbury has announced it plans to set up a bank.
Sainsbury's Bank will be 55 percent owned by the UK's second-largest
retailer and 45 percent owned by the Bank of Scotland.

The move into financial services by the retailer will be led by the
issuance of credit cards in early 1997. "The first phase will see the
launch of both classic and gold Visa cards, as well as attractive
additional account and card-based services providing broad customer
appeal," Sainsbury said in a statement.

The new 24-hour banking operation will be telephone-based and will
operate out of the Bank of Scotland's call centre in Edinburgh,
alongside the Scottish bank's own Banking Direct service, rather than
as part of it.

"We have the necessary infrastructure in place, but the products
offered will differ. They will be genuine Sainsbury products," said Ian
Fiddes, the bank's director of marketing services.

Sainsbury said it would be the first supermarket retailer to enter the
consumer banking market. The only other UK retailer to possess such a
licence is Marks & Spencer, which launched its charge card back in
1987.

The move has wrong-footed its main rival, Tesco, which, until
Sainsbury's announcement on October 25, had led moves by UK supermarket
groups into the financial services market.

Tesco launched its own budget account in June, offering 5.12 percent
interest on deposits, ten times some bank and building society deposit
rates. This, however, is operated by NatWest, which possesses the
banking licence. One leading UK banking analyst said the Sainsbury's
move was "one big step on from that".

Tesco, which has recently taken over from Sainsbury as the UK's biggest
supermarket group, refused to say whether it would respond by setting
up its own bank. "We do not comment on the activities of our rivals," a
spokeswoman said.

But other retailers have not discounted such a move. Kevin Hawkins,
Safeway's head of communications, said: "We have not ruled out the
provision of financial services should it fit with our customer
proposition."

For some time now, UK banks have had problems with their public image
and are becoming increasingly concerned with the activities of the more
"consumer-friendly" retailers. Bankers and analysts alike are promoting
collaborative joint ventures, like the Sainsbury venture, as the way
forward.

Tony Surridge, head of co-branding at NatWest UK, who was behind the
bank's joint venture with Tesco, said if the UK banks did not set up
alliances with retailers, US credit card operators would. "We would
rather be inside the goldfish bowl than looking in from outside," he
said.

Recently, British Gas, a major UK utility, and HFC Bank, a subsidiary
of the US Household Financial Corporation, teamed up to form Goldbrand
Development to manage its new Goldfish credit card. The Goldfish credit
card offers a loyalty point scheme whereby customers can save up to #75
on their gas bills.

British Gas and HFC said the Goldbrand joint venture company was aiming
to"rewrite the rules in financial services".

THAILAND:  BANK AND INSURER LAUNCH AFFINITY CARD

THAILAND'S LARGEST bank, Bangkok Bank, has launched an affinity card
with associate company Bangkok Life Assurance, just six months after
establishing a similar deal with Bangkok Insurance.

The three companies have a web of cross-shareholdings in a group
controlled by the country's influential Sophonpanich family.

The latest credit card, the BLA-BBL card, is being launched to mark
Bangkok Life Assurance's 45th anniversary and is being offered with
Bt200,000 ($8,000) of insurance cover which pays off any outstanding
credit card balance on the card of up to that amount if the holder dies
or is permanently disabled.

The promotion also offers a 10 percent discount on life assurance
policies and unspecified discounts on comprehensive motor insurance
policies with Bangkok Insurance, which also has a stake in its life
assurance affiliate.

Bangkok Bank has around 400,000 cards in issue, and is aiming to add
another 10,000 from the latest card in the next six months. The card is
being offered to all Bangkok Life Assurance clients with individual or
group life policies.

The affinity card is being offered as a blue or gold proprietary card,
and with classic and gold Visa card and standard and gold MasterCard
options.

The joining fee has been waived for applications before the end of the
year, as has half of the annual fee for the first year.

Otherwise, joining fees are Bt300 and Bt400 for local blue and gold
cards respectively and Bt600 for the international options. Full annual
fees are Bt600 for the blue cards, Bt900 for the local gold cards,
Bt1,000 for the classic/standard card and Bt1,500 for the international
gold card.

In April, Bangkok Bank launched a similar card with Bangkok Insurance
offering two alternatives - Bt500,000 cover or Bt300,000 insurance
against death or illness at a monthly premium of Bt235 to Bt2,510 and
Bt140 to Bt1,506 respectively. The cover is limited to cancer
diagnosis, a disease which is one of the biggest killers of Thais.

The scheme was targeted at all Bangkok Bank cardholders aged between 21
and 59 years, although applicants were required to fill in a health
form.

MALAYSIA:  BANK SIGNS SCHEME WITH ENGINEERS

MALAYSIA'S 30,000 engineers will be eligible to join Southern Bank's
Direct Access credit card and banking scheme following the signing of
an affinity programme in October.

The bank signed an agreement with the Institution of Engineers (IEM)
which will give its members special privileges on the bank programme.

The scheme offers IEM-Direct Access Visa and MasterCard affinity cards
bearing the IEM logo, the three-in-one current, savings and money
market accounts and the Direct Access/Maestro ATM and debit card.

IEM members will have their joining and annual fees waived for life and
will be subject to interest on outstanding balances of 1.49 percent a
month, the lowest rate in the country, according to Southern Bank.

The bank has signed similar affinity deals with the Medical Association
of Malaysia, the Malaysian Dentistry Association and Compaq computers.
The Direct Access programme is run as a standalone part of the bank and
is expected to see positive earnings in the next few months, having
been launched a year ago, said the division's head K Muganthan.

He is now working on another affinity programme with an unnamed mutual
fund company, aimed at encouraging high-net-worth clients to open
Direct Access accounts.

When Direct Access was launched a year ago, Muganthan said he was
aiming for 30,000 to 40,000 new customers a year. That target still
remains, he said.

The bank spent around M$10 million ($4 million) on computer software
and hardware last year to launch Direct Access, which features 24-hour
direct banking.

CARD REWARD DEALS REMAIN POPULAR

THE CONTINUING popularity of co-branding and reward deals is based on
solid business considerations. A little more than half of US consumers
who own a co-branded airline card say that owning the card influences
their choice of carrier, according to a new study by Brittain
Associates, an Atlanta-based research firm.

"Airline frequent-flier programmes have a lot of appeal to a fairly
narrow segment, but it's a viciously loyal segment," principal Bruce
Brittain told Cards International.

According to the study, about 6 percent of all US households claim to
own a credit card that provides air travel rewards linked to card
usage. Of these programmes, ten are co-branded card issues bearing
either the MasterCard or Visa marque, along with a bank's. Four of the
programmes generate points that can be redeemed for travel on any
airline.

"The majority of owners tell us that they use the card both for airfare
and other purchases," Brittain said. "And compared to other co-branded
cards we study, airline card owners use these cards much more
frequently."

It was such loyalty that American Express and Advanta hope to break
with their Rewards Accelerator Card that enables users to earn points
on their Amex membership rewards programme through a bank card (see
pages 1 and 6).

Among the surprises in the study, Brittain said, was the rapid growth
of the Delta SkyMiles Optima portfolio. "It's really vaulted up there,"
he said, and now rivals United's programme. Amex was careful to forbid
balance transfer from any Optima card to the new Rewards Accelerator.

Brittain added, however, that"the American Airlines AAdvantage
portfolio with Citibank is still the 800lbs gorilla among these
programmes, with twice as much business as its nearest competitors."

SUIT FILED AGAINST VISA

WAL-MART STORES, the world's largest retailer, and The Limited have
filed suit against Visa USA, charging that Visa's "honour all cards"
policy regarding debit and cheque cards is illegal.

Visa immediately responded in a statement saying it would fight the
suit.

The court action alleges that Visa's rule that each of its merchant
members accept all Visa cards, whether they be credit, online debit or
cheque card instruments is in violation of US anti-trust laws.

The suit hinges on the differing costs to retailers of processing
Visa's online debit cards versus banks' ATM cards with debit functions
attached and routed over local POS networks. According to the suit, the
merchants' profitability may erode when customers are allowed to
present online Visa debit cards.

Visa, according to its statement, "will vigorously defend this action
and believe that we will prevail".

The grounds on which it will defend itself hinge on two points,
according to Stephen Theoharis, senior vice-president and director of
litigation with the card association.

First, he said, Visa successfully defended itself against a similar
suit brought in 1983 by upscale retailer Nordstrom's. Second, it
regards the "honour all cards rule" as fostering rather than stifling
competition worldwide.

"If I can go into one of 13 million establishments worldwide and
present any Visa card for payment, we believe that encourages
competition," he said.

Regarding Visa's use of Nordstrom's precedent, the only difference
between 1983 and 1996, Theoharis said, is the enormously-enhanced
number of debit cards, offline and online, in circulation.

"Clearly, the debit card has been embraced by consumers," Theoharis
said. "But the number of cards has nothing to do with the issue
legally." There are about 35 million offline, or "cheque" cards
currently in circulation in the US.

Theoharis added: "They seem to be arguing that the debit transaction be
processed over regional POS networks. But what they don't seem to
understand is that one half of the bank ATM cards that are also debit
cards are Visa cheque cards.  "I think there is a misperception on Wal-
Mart's part. We have no rules for routing transactions. The merchants
are free to route that transaction as they see fit."

Curiously, MasterCard International, which has a similar rule, was not
mentioned in the suit. Industry speculation centres on Wal-Mart's
reluctance to sue MasterCard, its partner in a recent agreement to
offer the retailer's first-ever co-branded credit card in association
with Chase Manhattan and FDR.

BRANDING MEANS BONDING

In an increasingly-competitive cards market, a co-branding programme
can provide issuers with a keen edge

OVER THE past year co-branded and affinity products have outperformed
all other card products in the market place. As competition becomes
more fierce and brand loyalty decreases, co-branding is taking on a new
significance, Virlea Mays, president of the Mays Marketing Group told
delegates at Lafferty's International Retail Financial Services
Conference for Southern Africa in October.

"If we want the customer to want, use and keep our products, the way we
structure strategies and go to the market with our card products is
critical," she said.

"The credit card business is intensely competitive. It is expensive to
market, especially in the US, and by combining the marketing resources
and marketing expertise of two major organisations, you get more
muscle."

Co-branding offers significant benefits and enhancements to both
parties. Marketing expertise is shared by the issuer and co-brander, as
is the revenue.

The co-brander is typically profit-driven and usually has a recognised
brand or logo, merchant outlets and sales volume, often through a
proprietary card. Solicitation is done primarily by or through the co-
brander.

But the co-branding process is fraught with difficulties. Finding the
right partner and working out the relationship may seem
straightforward, but it is often not the case.

"The associations are important but the co-brand partner and the issuer
are the most critical component. And as they develop the partnership,
the most important thing is to define the contractual relationship and
the product and the value proposition of that product," said Mays.

The partners must start with an equitable contract and establish mutual
objectives. The two sides should design the product, value proposition
and packaging, and define credit approval criteria and credit limits.

A marketing plan should be developed and quality service standards
defined. While the ongoing relationship should be formalised, decision-
making and conflict/resolution processes and a termination agreement
should also be defined. But for the issuer, negotiating revenue and
expense sharing details is crucial.

"The ability to forecast how the revenue is shared can make the
difference for the issuer in terms of complete and total profit and
loss," explained Mays. "A lot of contracts were written so that the
issuer ends up with all of the responsibility and takes the full brunt
of the loss if the product fails or the programme simply doesn't work."

The time spent developing the partnership and working on the contract
is a key factor and one that is often overlooked, according to Mays.

"This is where the time needs to be taken and in most cases is not.
Everybody is rushing to get to the market and the correct length of
time is often not taken in the development of the contract," she said.

The length of the contract also has to be worked out and Mays advised
delegates to settle for a contract of between seven and ten years.
"Nobody is down in the three-year range, except maybe some affinity
programmes. There may be some five-year contracts out there, but there
is just too much riding on this, so contracts should be in the
neighbourhood of seven to ten years," she said.

When working out the rebate and reward structure, the co-branding
partners should be careful to make the product easy for the customer to
understand.

"Some rebate and reward structures work very well, some are way too
complicated for a consumer to really get caught up in to use the card,"
said Mays.

She cited a survey conducted by Visa in the US where consumers
indicated they wanted something that is simple and easy to use.

"We are all customers and we don't want a ten-page book to figure out
how to get our reward," she said. "We want reasonably easy
gratification and no tricks, no restrictions, no caps and no fine
points.

"The process is attempting to create a connection with the customer and
create some sort of emotional connection, even if that emotion is
greed."

When the product is designed, the next piece of the equation is to
define the marketing plan. This involves developing strategies for:

* Acquisition - acquire new accounts and appeal to customers to want
the card.

* Activation - generate a balance and induce activity so the cardholder
will use the account.

* Retention - become the "card of choice", so profitable customers keep
accounts.

"Many of the programmes designed in the US and in other parts of the
world, such as AT&T, do a great job in acquiring but they do not do the
best job possible at activation. The activation today in AT&T is still
only about 49 percent and the industry average is 65 percent," said
Mays.
