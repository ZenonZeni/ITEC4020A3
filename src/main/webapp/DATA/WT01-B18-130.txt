<H1>Solving the Transportation Crisis</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><I><hr>An essay from the executive director<hr></I></H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet. That old
GM slogan is not so much a sales pitch as a true
reflection of our national culture. The American love
affair with     the automobile is so pervasive and the
car is such an integral part of our economy, it has come
to shape our productivity, our social lives, our
landscape, and even our self-esteem.
<P>
Americans have more than one car per licensed driver. We
drive those cars more than ever-2.23 trillion miles per
year-and the number of miles the average car travels per
year is growing twice as fast as the population. 
<P>
And no wonder. The car offers greater mobility than any
other sort of transport, in a culture where mobility is
increasingly mandatory. It also offers a large measure
of comfort, safety, power, and style. We can go where we
want, when we want, without exposing ourselves to the
harsh elements of nature or the criminal elements of
society. These are crucial amenities.
<P>
But the love affair with the car, like all obsessions,
has its costs. Any knuckle-biting commuter, stuck in her
thousandth traffic jam, can testify about the automobile
population crisis. All those hours spent in traffic cost
us economically and emotionally: They assess a
multibillion-dollar toll on our productivity, and they
steal time we might otherwise spend enjoying other
aspects of life, like family and friends.
<P>
Our cities, especially younger cities, are given over to
the car (two-thirds of Los Angeles is paved!). Dads and
moms who must spend hours chauffeuring their kids to and
from school, sports, and friends' houses can readily
understand how the very mobility of the car has
restricted access and choice for those who cannot drive.
Of course it is children, the elderly, and the poor who
know this trapped feeling most poignantly.
<P>
And the environment--from the smoggy air in L.A. to the
oil-fouled shores of Prince William Sound, from the
toxic earth around Louisiana's refineries to the noise
that is so much a part of New York City's
ambience--continues to bear the brunt of the auto.
Perhaps the ultimate sacrifice is our kids' lungs, which
now operate at a 15 percent diminished capacity in Los
Angeles and which are increasingly susceptible to
disease.
<P>
Even our national security is at stake. The last two
decades have brought us two oil crises and one oil war,
but the nation's appetite for oil still grows. Close to
half the oil this nation consumes is imported from
abroad, the largest proportion ever.
<P>
<IMG HEIGHT=439 WIDTH=341 ALIGN=right ALT="Figure of 
Energy Consumption by Highway Vehicles" SRC="figure1.gif">

These problems are getting worse. This graph suggests
that the next oil crisis is only a matter of time and,
as we all know, decisions made in crisis are usually not
the wisest.

<P>
What can be done? Is there no way to keep the benefits
of the car without jeopardizing our cities, our health,
our national security, and our peace of mind? Do we have
to choose between a healthy downtown and a prosperous
Detroit, between decent neighborhoods for our kids and
mobility for ourselves, between breathing clean air and
getting to work?
<P>
This essay argues that the transportation crisis is
solvable, that it is possible to build livable cities
and functioning transportation systems that do not
sacrifice individual mobility.
The ideas that follow are collected from innovative
thinkers around the world. Many of these ideas
constitute a fundamental departure from past policies
and mechanisms of governance, but without such changes,
we will simply drive ourselves from one crisis to the
next. 
<PBR CLEAR=all>
<A HREF="transportation.html">The Energy Foundation's
transportation program</A> is designed to test and
promote these solutions. Our grants have two broad aims:
To refocus spending on our transportation infrastructure
so that more economically efficient and environmentally
benign choices are made, and to spur innovation of and
markets for cleaner vehicle technologies. We are under
no illusion that either task will be easy, but we
believe that, together, such policies will create more
transportation choices, fewer environmental problems,
and more livable towns and cities.
<P>
The graphic that guides readers through this essay
illustrates the range of solutions proposed for these
problems.
<P>
<A NAME="two">Each </A>policy has some potential, but
each has profound limitations.  Consider, for example,
the position of people who focus their energies on
raising fuel economy.  Raising automobile fuel mileage
has already doubled the efficiency of new cars
<I>(see figure 2)</I>. Why not double
it again, and skip the hard work of trying to stem
vehicle miles traveled?

	<H4><I><hr>People who labor in the transportation
field tend to become fixated on one or another favored
policy. Automakers argue that  market signals should
steer their decisions. Safety and environmental
advocates counter that regulations have successfully led
to safer and cleaner cars. Transit authorities despair
of the $300 billion in costs that private autos impose
on society while railroads, subways, and buses languish
for lack of funding. And those who care about the form
of traditional towns--the village square, the
neighborhood shop, and streets safe for children--rail
against sprawl and Wal-Marts and strip malls.

<P>
Why not?  Because the extraordinary rise in the
distances we drive and the number of trips we take has
absorbed all the gains we have made in fuel efficiency
during the last 15 years <I>(see
figures 3 and 4)</I>. Only if the growth in miles
traveled can be stemmed will raising fuel efficiency
standards and moving to ultra-clean, ultra-efficient
cars render major improvements.

<STRONG>
The real potential for change, then, lies in integrating
solutions. This essay looks, in turn, at improvements to
the auto, changes in fuels, changing land-use patterns,
and new approaches to building and running the
transportation infrastructure.</STRONG>
