     Welcome to the first issue of ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT

     Welcome to the first issue of ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT
NEWS, the latest addition to the Phillips Publishing, Inc. family
of newsletters.
     In the past few years there has been much progress in the
development of products and services that automate virtually
every aspect of trade and transportation.  Because trade now
takes place in a truly global marketplace, the competition has
become much more fierce.  Thus, companies are turning to
automation as a vehicle through which to attain a competitive
edge.  Today, executives of companies as large as IBM and as
small as the family-owned customs brokers, are focusing on ways
to leverage strategic benefits that come from computerizing trade
data.
     Every other week ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS will
report on the trends and developments that are changing the way
products are bought sold and moved.  Phillips Publishing is
uniquely positioned to bring you this information because its
experienced team of editors has been providing hard-hitting,
analytical coverage of the competitive communications strategies
for more than a decade.  Tim Shorrock, who has been reporting on
international trade, transportation and the Pacific Rim for 10
years, will continue as editor.  Now here's the news:

NYNEX BUYS LAMARIAN SYSTEMS

     Nynex Corp. took a major step toward its goal of becoming a
global provider of business software and professional services by
buying Lamarian Systems Inc., the Greenbelt, Md., management and
systems consulting firm that specializes in transportation and
international trade.  Under the terms of the acquisition,
Lamarian will continue to operate independently as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Nynex International, which represents Nynex from
offices in Hong Kong, Singapore, Geneva, London and New York.

Strategic Alliances with PTTs

     As one of the regional spinoffs of AT&T, Nynex is prohibited
from manufacturing equipment, providing interstate or
international telephone services and selling information
services.  But it can provide telecommunications gateways and
value-added services, such as consulting or software.  To this
end, the company has established a string of what it calls
"strategic alliances" with PTTs (postal, telephone and telegraph
agencies) around the world.  In Europe, Nynex provides telephone
network management services to British Telecom and France
Telecom; computer software to the British financial services
industry; and high-speed data and facsimile transmissions between
Scandinavia and the United States.
     In Asia, the company has formed consulting relationships
with PTTs in Japan, Australia, Singapore, the People's Republic
of China and Taiwan.
     Last year, Nynex signed a broad marketing and technical
agreement with Data Communications Corp. of South Korea (Dacom),
a state-owned company that provides the gateway for all of that
country's EDI communications.
     Nynex has also been scouring world markets for potential
acquisitions and, like several other Baby Bells, is deeply
involved in the cellular telephone industry in Europe.  "They've
got money coming out of their ears," said a software vendor
familiar with the company.
     Overall, Nynex views its business mission as improving
telecommunications services for its large multinational
customers.  The Lamarian acquisition "fits very nicely" into that
strategy "because of the international nature of trade and
transportation," said Susan Simon, director of strategy assurance
for Nynex International, which is headquartered in White Plains,
N.Y.  "We're really excited about the deal."

Lamarian: Projects in Australia, Agreements with GEIS

     For Lamarian, the link with Nynex will provide financial
resources, technology and sales expertise as well as a presence
in more than 70 countries.  Nynex also offers a sophisticated
laboratory that can bring additional technology to the company.
"This is what we've been looking for for a long time--a worldwide
reach," said Harry Latimer, president of the company, in an
interview with ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS.
     Lamarian develops and markets software for government
agencies and companies involved in international trade and
transportation.  It has extensive experience in the port and
ocean shipping industries and was the prime contractor for the
U.S. Customs Service's Automated Commercial System.  Latimer has
a background in the trucking and rail industries, where he served
as MIS director for several leading carriers.
     In recent years, Lamarian has staked out a strong position
in international transport services.  Among its current projects:


      An EDI system for the Port of Melbourne, Australia.
     Lamarian is also conducting a business needs analysis for
     Tradegate, the Australian national port system.  This
     summer, Latimer will be joining a tour of Australia with the
     companies participating in Tradegate to market the concept
     to other ports.  "Australia is a natural target for
     expansion."

      A contract with Columbus Lines, the West German steamship
     line with offices in Hamburg and Newark, N.J., to develop an
     EDI customer interface system for its U.S. customers that
     will later be expanded into Australia, Germany and South
     America.

      Software development and information consulting for Racers,
     the community information system for the ports of San
     Francisco and Oakland, Calif.  Now in pilot stage, the
     Racers system will include what Latimer calls a "simple EDI
     mailbox" that will allow a user to convert a message into
     EDI or facsimile and transmit electronically to another
     party.  The system will also include an expert system that
     will allow users to translate from one message to another.

      An agreement with General Electric Information Services
     (GEIS) to provide an electronic link with the U.S. Customs
     Service's Automated Manifest System.  Using Lamarian's Ocean
     Going Management System, forwarders, carriers and shippers
     will be able to transmit manifest data to Customs via the
     GEIS network, speeding up the process for cargo clearance.
     All the information on the system will be in EDI format,
     which will allow users to channel the data to home offices
     and other parties.  Latimer said Lamarian is also working on
     a tariff and booking interface for the system.

     The non-exclusive remarketing alliance with GEIS will
continue, despite the acquisition by Nynex.  "We think [the GEIS
agreement] is a very positive relationship and will bring
additional market coverage," said Nynex's Simon when asked if
GEIS might be viewed as a potential competitor in the interna-
tional trade field.  Lamarian and GEIS were meeting last week to
formulate their plans, according to Latimer.
     Nynex and Lamarian will be announcing plans for other
software services and capabilities in a month.  "Our plan is to
work together to grow Lamarian and make them stronger, bigger and
better," said Simon.

THE SLOW PACE OF AUTOMATION  IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE

     There was a sober undercurrent to the International Trade
     and Computerization Show sponsored by the NCITD-
     International Trade
Facilitation Council in New York earlier this month.  Despite
tremendous advances in computer and software technology and the
obvious and pressing need for automation, it was clear that a
comprehensive information system for handling the demands of
international transportation and logistics is still a long way
off.
     The difficulties facing the industry were underscored on the
opening day of the conference, when the Federal Maritime
Commission (FMC), citing technical problems, cancelled a session
on the FMC's long-awaited computerized database for ocean tariff
rates (see p. 8).  They were also evident in many of the
conference sessions devoted to EDI and automation, where speakers
consistently focused on the gap between what they want and the
information products and services currently available on the
market.
     Another sign of the complexities of international trade
automation was the number of companies that didn't show up.
Infonet Network Services, which 6 months ago announced a master
plan to develop a global EDI system for transport, was nowhere to
be seen.  AT&T and British Telecom, which are also aiming at the
global logistics market, were absent as well.  The London-based
Export Network, which is reportedly having trouble lining up
customers for its forwarder-shipper network (now months behind
schedule) didn't send a representative, a strange move for a
company that has spent thousands of dollars to build a U.S.
customer base.

Some Signs of Optimism

     To be sure, there were signs of optimism at the meeting.
The U.S. Customs Service announced that it was seeking funds
to build an automated system for exports in cooperation with the
Commerce Department.  Several firms displayed new, innovative
automation packages for exports.  Financial services for trade,
for so long the missing ingredient at these shows, finally
appeared to be making some progress.
     And in a keynote speech, Lynn Fritz, president and sole
shareholder of Fritz & Co., said the U.S. forwarding industry was
"remarkably well-postured" to dominate the world market for trade
services in a similar manner that American insurance and
accounting firms have dominated in their sectors.
     But Fritz also issued a warning to firms that don't keep up
with customer demands for automation:  "Companies that don't
deliver the goods...will suffer the modest pains of extinction,"
he said.
     In short, the NCITD show gave the appearance of an industry
that is treading water and waiting for something to happen.
Participants and speakers identified 3 key problem areas:

     The general lack of interest in EDI among small and medium
companies.  Currently, nearly half of the companies on the
Fortune 500 are using, or planning to use, EDI.  Even if the
remaining 50 percent and the next tier of suppliers and customers
becomes EDI-capable in the 1990s as expected, that will still
leave thousands of companies hooked on paper.  "The vast majority
of shippers are not automated, and that's a big issue," said Pano
Anthos, vice president of Syntra Ltd., a New York software house
specializing in international trade.

     The continued use by the largest shippers--particularly
multinational corporations--of proprietary communications systems
and networks.  In several workshops it was noted that major U.S.
firms doing business in Europe, including Ford Motor Co. and IBM,
are not only using but expanding the private communications
networks they use for international transactions.  "One reason
EDI is moving very, very slowly is because people are operating
in a proprietary environment," said Tony Barone, vice president
of Randy International, a New York air freight forwarder that has
been using EDI for international communications for over a year.
"That makes it difficult to benefit if you're using EDI."

     The frustrations of booking cargo electronically.  "The
problem is, every [carrier] is different," said Duncan Alexander,
director of export services for Johnson & Johnson International
and chairman of the NCITD's computerization committee.  "It's
just not worth the trouble to go into each carrier's PC system."
Hank Ulrich, president of H.B. Ulrich & Associates Inc., a
"systems solutions" firm that works with Johnson & Johnson,
complained that the major ocean carriers "have been talking EDI
for many years, but there's always something they can't do."  Few
can offer the capabilities to accept electronic booking notices
or bills of lading, he noted.  Another serious drawback: the
inability of most carriers to provide electronic confirmation of
delivery.  "We have people who do nothing but call the airlines"
to see if a shipment has arrived, said Barone.

One Big Database?

     To resolve these problems, some shipping executives have
proposed a "one-stop" data bank that would allow them to make
bookings and receive confirmation statements on steamship lines
(as well as air cargo carriers) using EDI.
     In an interview, Johnson & Johnson's Alexander said he
envisions a "generic system" similar to the Sabre passenger
reservation system that travel agents use to find available seats
and book flights.  "We'd like to have one telephone number to
book cargo in standard formats with every line," he said.
     But past efforts in that direction have failed commercially.
At the same time, carriers have balked at the "one-stop" idea
because they believe a generic reservation system would expose
confidential information.  "The problem is, carriers fear that
their customer list would be made public," said R.T. Crowley, a
former steamship executive who now heads his own transportation
consulting firm, C.W. Consultants.  "That's one of the things
that will hold booking close to the lines."
     Crowley suggested 2 alternatives: centralized booking
systems operated by shipping conferences (an idea being pursued
by the Atlantic Conference); and a mailbox system operated by the
value-added networks that would allow shippers to dial a
carrier's mailbox and transmit shipping data.
     But Alexander said the concept of a common database for
shippers shouldn't be dismissed.  "Banks move billions of dollars
every day by wire," he said.  "They've handled the
confidentiality problem.  If there can be a global market in
finance and security trading, why not in transportation?"

1400).

IBM LOGISTICS STRATEGY STILL A MYSTERY AFTER NCITD SESSION

     IBM raised more questions than it answered at a May 31
     presentation before the NCITD computerization committee.
     The session, which focused on IBM's work to assist shippers
and carriers in the integrated logistics and information systems
areas, sparked intense speculation, particularly among shippers
and software vendors.  Would there be a major product
announcement?  Was the company going to disclose its list of
software partnerships for trade and transport?

Speculation prompted by IBM

     These questions were prompted by IBM itself, which has
expressed strong interest in the logistics industry.  Last year,
executives from IBM's International Trade Solutions Group in
Boulder, Colo., told us that it was developing products for the
international trade market (see "IBM Readies 'Total Solution' for
International Trade," COMPUTERS IN TRADE & TRANSPORT, October
1989).
     At the same time, other divisions of IBM have been active in
developing data systems for the trucking and rail industry.  Last
January, IBM announced a joint venture with Motorola Inc. to
market a nationwide network that will allow companies to provide
mobile workers with direct access to computer databases through
hand-held terminals built by Motorola and a radio network built
by IBM.                   According to John Pemberton, an IBM
analyst with the Gartner Group, the company is also working on 2
major projects in the mobile satellite/data communications area:
an onboard PC that will be compatible with satellite-based
systems for the trucking industry, built by such vendors as
Geostar and Qualcomm; and an international mobile network for
companies with large field operations, such as food franchises
and oil and gas companies.
     On the carrier side, IBM is reportedly developing automated
communications dispatch systems for Consolidated Freightways,
Roadway Inc. and J.B. Hunt--3 of the largest motor carriers in
the United States.  IBM is also working closely with Sea-Land
Service Inc. on automatic equipment identification systems for
ocean shipping and on Automatic Train Control Systems with CSX
Transportation Inc.
     "I'm getting some very strong indications there are some
major things going on with IBM" in the logistics area, said
Pemberton.

Framework for Logistics

     But NCITD members looking for an integrated automation
system geared to the needs of shippers were disappointed.
Instead, the group was presented with a pitch for IBM's latest
product offerings in office technology and services, centered
around IBM's Systems Application Architecture (SAA), a vehicle
for systems integration being marketed aggressively in the U.S.
business community.
     IBM, said David R. Livingstone, industry administrator for
IBM's transportation industry marketing division based in
Southbury, Conn., is ready to "support the emergence of a general
framework for integrated logistics" and "end-to-end freight
movement."  To do that, "We now have all the products in place to
create one single image of the enterprise...All the pieces are
here."  In areas where information gaps exist, Livingstone said,
IBM is ready to work with customers on such new technologies as
automatic equipment identification, barcode scanning and high-
performance databases.  Some examples:

      For strategic planners, IBM will "put in your shop
tomorrow" an Executive Information System based on the "Office
Vision" component of SAA that will allow executives to plan
marketing, pricing, routing and scheduling of cargo.  The system
can also be augmented by artificial intelligence (expert systems)
for short-term forecasting and other functions.

      In the air cargo industry, where all the players use paper
and telephone and there is "no tactical, strategic or real-time
data for rapid delivery," IBM will provide a "simple relational
database" that could be integrated with automatic equipment
identification and radio-frequency barcoding to track containers.
A similar framework is possible for ocean shipping.

      To build that "single image" framework, IBM has available a
wide range of products, including EDI translation software and
local area networks that will provide a "common user view from PC
to mainframe."  IBM will even provide a mouse-driven graphic
interface that "resembles a video game" and requires "no
knowledge of computers."

      For companies that want to improve their control over the
flow of paper, IBM has developed image processing software that
automatically queues a document to the next person in the chain
and allows a supervisor to prioritize documents and monitor
employees.  The software can be linked to a telephone switching
system that routes customer calls to a designated employee and
simultaneously recalls the image of the customer's document on a
computer screen.  Image-processing technology, said Livingstone,
has many uses in transportation, including customer service
departments, inter-line cargo scheduling and exchanges of data
between freight forwarders and carriers.

Internal IBM Strategies Unclear

     In an interview, Livingstone said IBM's transportation
strategy was "reasonably well-integrated with other IBM groups."
But it became clear during the presentation that the transport
and international trade groups were not entirely in synch.
     At one point, software executive Pano Anthos said that IBM's
integrated approach would be "difficult to justify to senior
management" because there is no single depository for the carrier
data needed for a strategic analysis.  "Even the IBM network is
mostly proprietary," he said.  "It would be helpful if a
corporation selling a technology would be a leader in using that
technology."
     That prompted someone to ask if IBM's international trade
solutions group was using EDI standards.  The answer: no, the
group uses internal standards.  In that case, what are your plans
for standards?  In international purchasing "we are moving in the
areas of standards and will support the emergence" of Edifact,
responded John Gates, a top executive with the group.
     That apparent double-standard angered some participants.
"IBM has a lot of nerve talking about the carriers not connecting
when the VANs have no interconnection abilities themselves," said
one executive.  Other participants said the presentation focused
too heavily on domestic carrier operations and questioned the
wisdom of promoting image-processing technology at a time when
the shipping community is trying to expand the use of EDI.
     But the most scathing comment came from a systems
integration specialist, who said the entire program was
"inappropriate."  "This was only something IBM could have done,"
he said.  "It really shows the clout of Big Blue...Do you think
that an Ordernet or a Kleinschmidt could have asked for an hour
and a half on the NCITD agenda?  No way."

Analyst View

     Pemberton--who did not attend the session--said IBM's
emphasis on systems architecture has important implications for
the logistics industry.  "We believe IBM is trying to extend the
SAA architecture framework from the office out to field
operations," he said.  "That's maximum capture [of data].  DEC
[Digital Equipment Corp.] and the other vendors aren't even
watching the ball game on this one."
     IBM's "end-game," he said, "isn't the dispatcher looking for
some better gadget to monitor something.  It's the information
system itself."  If IBM is successful in building a system that
can integrate office communications, EDI and mobile satellite
technology with the SAA platform, he said, "they're in fat
city...That's where they sell mainframes, AS-400s and everything
else."

CUSTOMS SEEKING FUNDS FOR EXPORT SYSTEM

     The U.S. Customs Service has asked the Bush administration
     to provide $40 million to allow Customs and the Census
     Bureau to capture export data.  The proposed system, said
     Samuel Banks, assistant
commissioner for commercial operations, would provide a tool for
Customs to communicate with customs agencies in other countries
and would simplify the classification of goods under the
harmonized system.  "This is a major undertaking," he told
ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT NEWS.  "But we can't do it without a
commitment" from the administration.
     "As a unit volume, exports have increased substantially
since the fourth quarter of 1982, to over 10 million per year,"
Banks told the NCITD.  "We should have learned by now that we
can't always depend on other countries to tell us which of our
products have crossed their borders.  If we make this initiative
work, the benefits will be immediate and substantial."

FMC AUTOMATED TARIFF SYSTEM UNDER REVIEW

     The Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) abruptly cancelled a
scheduled speech to the NCITD about the FMC's proposed system for
automating ocean freight rates May 30.  In a letter to the group,
FMC Commissioner Rob Quartel said the speaker, James Warner,
stayed in Washington because the FMC is "reviewing a number of
elements related to the development of the automated tariff
filing and information system (ATFI)."
     The incident left many NCITD members wondering if there were
deeper political or technical problems with the system, which was
designed to computerize access to the thousands of ocean freight
rates maintained by the FMC.  "There should have been a
representative here to talk to people," said R.T. Crowley, a
transportation consultant.  "This approach only caused rumors and
speculation."

Problems with Contractor

     Last summer, the FMC awarded contracts for the ATFI system
to Planning Research Corp. (PRC), a Virginia consulting firm, and
DXI Inc., a Pittsburgh software vendor.  According to a source
close to the FMC, the agency has become "very dissatisfied with
what PRC has done."  The source said the FMC is backing away from
its plans to build a large database for freight rates and
studying an "approach more like U.S. Customs" in which steamship
lines prepare and transmit shipping data directly to the agency.
     Tariff filing is just one aspect of ATFI that's being
studied, said Quartel, who spoke to ELECTRONIC TRADE & TRANSPORT
NEWS last week to "end any uncertainty" about the automation
project.  Quartel, who chairs the FMC automation committee, said
that while the FMC "doesn't know precisely where we are" on
filing, "our goal is to make it as easy as possible" for both
small and large carriers.  The FMC is also looking at how the
filing system will affect the agency's internal operations, and
has asked the contractors to survey other data products on the
market.

Major Shift

     In a significant shift from earlier plans, Quartel said he
had asked the contractors to change the interface technology on
the user side from dumb terminals to PCs.  The testing phase, he
said, showed that the system "was not as user-friendly as we
would have liked it to have been."
    Quartel said he is concerned that "the private sector is
moving faster and more innovatively than we might be, so I wanted
to make sure we were on the right track from that standpoint."
     "As a global issue," he continued, "we have to be very
cognizant of moves towards the ending of paper...Ultimately,
we've got to find a way to carry this electronically from the
creation of a contract between shipper and carrier all the way
down to the bill of lading and Customs.  Our goal is not to get
in the way of that."
     The FMC will issue a report on ATFI in several weeks and
will be asking for comments from ocean carriers and shipping
conferences at that time, Quartel said.
