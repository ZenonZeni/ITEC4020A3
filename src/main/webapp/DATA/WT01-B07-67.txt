Three ventilation systems were installed in a recently refurbished test house: full house mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MHVR), passive stack ventilation (PSV) and extract fans in kitchen and bathroom. Humidifiers were installed to simulate normal occupancy and behaviour of the ventilation was monitored over the winter of 1993/94. The test house has a low leakage rate of 3 ac h-1 at 50 Pa pressure difference; this low rate was maintained over the duration of the tests. A comparison of ventilation rates provided by the three systems is given. MHVR was the most effective in maintaining low humidity.

Data on moisture sources, winter condensation potential, carbon dioxide levels, levels of biological contamination and blood lymphocytes from fifty nine houses subjected to detailed testing and inspection in a previous phase of the Wallaceburg study were subject to more detailed statistical evaluation to determine the relationships between moisture sources, fungal growth and objective measures of health. The work showed a correlation between measurements of mold growth and immunological reactions of occupants and that mold growth appeared to be more related to local moisture sources than air change levels.

Finished basements in twenty seven Ottawa houses were investigated to determine if the basement assemblies could contribute to poor indoor air quality due to molds. The wall cavities were inspected with optical fibrescopes to determine the composition and note the conditions. Visible mold colonies were sampled to identify mold species. The presence of molds correlated with the presence of chronic wetting events rather than ant particular basement finishing techniques. Molds were analyzed form 16 (59%) of the houses and toxigenic mold were found in all houses except one.

The object of this parametric study is to make a contribution to the design of building elements in offices and other non-residential premises without occupant sensitive climatic control, and to put forward views regarding heating strategy. Cooling is discussed here only as passive cooling, i.e. cooling which can be achieved by making use of the building itself and its ventilation without the need to install refrigeration equipment. The need for cooling arises due to the architectural and structural design of the building. For instance, large southerly, easterly and westerly glazed areas demand solar control if active cooling is to be avoided. These are also dealt with in this study. The interest in offices and other working premises has increased in recent years die to the health problems which the users have experienced as a result of internal climatic conditions. It has generally been possible to trace back such ill-health to emissions from materials or to the ventilation system. Demands have been made for the supply of fresh air to be increased and for the effectiveness of ventilation to be improved. This has been taken into account in varying the parameters used in this study.

The paper briefly describes the AC pressurisation method of building airtightness measurement and the disadvantages of earlier analysis methods. A new analysis method is described, based on fitting a non-linear function of the unknowns to data. The function is derived from the differential equations of the system components. The new method performed well with simulated data. With real data, the method produced good estimates of the leakage flow rate at 4Pa pressure loss, leakage length/area and enclosure flexing, but poor estimated of the leakage exponent. it is suspected that this problem was due to measurement errors.

<P>
The AC pressurisation method of measuring the airtightness of building is briefly described. Using a simplified model, the leakage characteristics of the enclosure may be found by Fourier analysis of the pressure signal if the effects of compressibility and flexing are neglected. These effects become small at low frequency, but the frequency required to make them negligible may be too low for the available instruments and the resulting pressure signal may be smaller than appropriate for building airtightness measurements. The conditions under which the other approximations in the model may be justified are not yet know.

Discussion of ventilation standards in relation to the needs of health care, for example in operating rooms. Compares various ventilation standards. Concludes that air changes per hour would be the better predictor of patient exposure to contamination only if contamination were generated based on the volume of the patient room. A ventilation standard based on cfm per patient is likely to be more representative of expected contamination levels within a space than an air change per hour standard. The reason is that contamination sources are likely to be related to either the infactious patient themselves, or to patients, their visitors, and activities; while room volume is unlikely to be related to contamination sources.

In buoyancy driven, displacement ventilation, the incoming "fresh" air is gently introduced near the floor and at a temperature just slightly lower than the design room air temperature. The cool air flows slowly over the floor and air that has become warmed rises above the cool layer. Any local heat sources in the lower part of the room create convection currents that also contribute to the general upward movement and the air is ultimately exhausted at high level. Although this type of system has been used in other countries, notably in Scandinavia, since 1970, there is little experience of its use in the UK. This report contains state of the art information on the application of this method of ventilation and data appropriate to the design and operation in this country.

An existing derivation of capture efficiency of a kitchen range hood in a confined flow system, based on a two-zone mixing model, is shown to be inconsistent and inadequate. A new derivation proposed, which shows that the capture efficiency equals the ratio of captured flow rate to the total plume flow rate at the front canopy height. The new capture efficiency equals the direct capture efficiency, if we assume that the hood captures contaminant directly from the source as efficiently as it captures contaminant that is entrained from the room.

In non-industrial buildings the general ventilation is usually sufficient to ensure that fresh air is renewed at an adequate rate. Many industrial premises, on the other hand, have localised emissions of contaminants that require local exhaust ventilation. But in practice local exhaust systems may not be 100% efficient, allowing contaminants to escape and mix with the ambient air. Ventilation designers need tools to allow them to assess the efficiency of different arrangements. A new approach to ventilation design is being developed, based on the concept of residence time distribution. The method promises to be easier than modern computational fluid dynamics but more accurate than traditional "rule of thumb" techniques.

An underfloor air conditioning system designed for buildings with intelligent features was developed and introduced into a smart building in Tokyo. Laboratory experiments, numerical simulations, field measurement studies were carried out before and after occupancy, to estimate and confirm the level of thermal comfort and energy saving effects of the system. These studies revealed that, compared with the conventional ceiling diffuser air conditioning system, the underfloor air conditioning system not only promoted highly efficient exhaust heat removal, but also increased the rate of dependency on natural energy. It was confirmed that in the underfloor air conditioning system, exhaust heat was elevated upward, carried by the air flow that blew from the floor to the ceiling, and formed thermal layers. This meant that exhaust heat was effectively discharged from the occupied space. The studies revealed that supply air temperature of 20 Deg. C could sufficiently serve as supply air all year round. The length of period dependent on natural ventilation was extended and the annual energy consumption level monitored also proved this. The supply air with a higher temperature enabled a higher temperature for the chilled water, and resulted in a more efficient operation of the refrigerators. it was also found out that the underfloor air conditioning system could be easily integrated with a passive energy system (such as "night purge" that utilised natural ventilation) to form an effective hybrid energy system. As a result, this building consumed primary energy of 432 Mcal/h m2 during the fiscal year of 1994, which was quite small compared with other conventional smart buildings in Tokyo.

Evaporative cooling is used extensively for cooling climates with medium to low humidity. In residential buildings the conventional mechanical systems to be both noisy and unsightly. Here a proposal is presented fro a passive evaporative cooling system which makes use of natural ventilation at the building facade. The system makes use of the evaporative effect from water falling vertically along guides to produces a reduction in the temperature of the air entering the building. it can also be used as a design element in the building facade. Such a system provided an inexpensive, energy efficient, environmentally benign and potentially attractive cooling system. A numerical study is presented to demonstrate the system efficiency and air flow rate through a building, making use of measured outside wind speed and direction, building geometry and surroundings. The likely effect of the system on the indoor air temperature is discussed; further work is being undertaken to explore the integration of such a system into the building fabric.

The aim of the study was to characterize the microbiological status of four school buildings with or without moisture problems. Both air samples and surface samples were taken. The study was a part of an epidemiological health study among the school children. The total concentrations of airborne fungi in three problem schools were 5-530 cfu/m3 and in the reference school 21-160 cfu/m3. Certain fungal genera were only detected in the problem schools. This was true in both air and surface samples. The results also indicate that the children's entering the room increases the concentrations of airborne fungi. The concentrations of surface samples in the problem school were higher than in the reference school as well.

Allergen levels of mites were measured in dust from classrooms with carpeted and wooden floors in school by sandwich ELISA. Mite allergen levels in dust samples from open-style classrooms with carpeted floors were as low as those of conventional classrooms with wooden floors. Some conventional classrooms and closed-type music rooms with carpeted floors gave high mite allergen levels. The mite allergen levels were highest in July or August, the most humid and hottest seasons in Japan, and decreased in November. The dust mite levels correlated with humidity but not temperature. It was suggested that humidity was one of important factors which affected mite allergen levels in carpeted classrooms. Attention needs to be paid to the structure and the ventilation which have an effect on humidity, when carpet is installed on the floors of classrooms.

The results in this paper represent a small part of a three year ongoing research project, "Indoor Environment in Schools". The project has been an effect study of rehabilitation in schools with poor indoor air quality. This project is a co-operation between the counties of Oppland and Vest Agder, the municipality of Ha in Rogaland and RF-Rogaland Research. The aim of the project has been to investigate the indoor environment in regard to the pupils' health, social environment and level of performance. The project has included field investigations of indoor air quality, pupils' health and social climate in addition to a reaction time test, called SPES. The results show both correlations between pupils' health and the CO2 concentrations in the classrooms, and between the pupils' performance and the CO2 concentrations.

This paper presents preliminary results from the first nine months of monitoring the Oxford Solar House (OSH) which was built, in particular, to evaluate the potential for photovoltaics to contribute cost effectively to domestic energy supply in the UK. The house was built in a south facing site with good solar access. It has a 4kWPV system integrated into the roof structure and a 5 metre squared solar thermal domestic hot water pre-heat. The house was designed to require a minimum of energy for heating, cooling and lighting, therefore optimizing the significance of the contribution of the solar electric supply. The performance of the PV system is presented, as well as an analysis of the whole design strategy to minimized energy loads.

The traditional Yemeni window is considered to be one of the most important elements that characterize the yemeni architecture. The beauty of the traditional Yemeni window comes from its four main components which combined the function of view, lighting, ventilation, protection, and privacy. These functions can be controlled by the occupants according to their social and environmental needs. The four main components are the lower part (Taqah), the fanlight (Qamariyah), the wooden external overhang (Konnah), and the small vent (Shaquos). Since fanlights provided natural lighting during day-time, the area of the lower part can be reduced and its exterior shutters can be closed without the need for artificial lighting. The internal natural lighting that is provided by the upper and lower parts of the window was investigated see its quality. In this investigation, there were two main goals. The first is the contribution and quality of the internal light provided by the Qamariyah when shutters are closed. The second is the effect of the internal simple white cloth curtains, in the lower part,in the internal light quality. Visual measurements were taken in a typical room of a traditional house of the Old City of Sana's, Yemen. From the findings, it was found that the fanlights (Qamariyat) provide low and soft homogeneous internal lighting which was as low as 22 lux average. However, the occupants have the ability to increase the level of lighting to as high as 600 or 700 lux. This can be done simply by deciding which shutter to open and how many of them to be opened. In this paper, the methodology and findings will be presented and discussed.

The Santa Amalia building in Barcelona is a block of six flats incorporating a duct by which light is sent to the kitchens - previously without natural lighting - and also allows natural ventilation. Moreover, the passive solar gains obtained from the extensive glazed surfaces and the conservation of internal heat gains, along with a high degree of insulation, give energy saving of 68% for heating.

The heating or cooling of a space to maintain thermal comfort is a highly energy intensive process accounting for as much as 60-70% of total energy use in non-industrial buildings. Of this, approximately 30-50% is lost through ventilation and air infiltration. A recent review concludes that as the thermal insulation characteristics of buildings improve, ventilation and air movement are expected to become the dominant heating and cooling loss mechanism in buildings of the next century. While it is theoretically possible to reduce the energy impact of ventilation by restricting the rate of air change, this can have a dramatic influence on indoor air quality. On the other hand, there are many instances where air change is excessive or ventilation is called upon to deal with air quality problems that should be treated in other, less energy intensive ways. Only by understanding the role of ventilation and alternative control strategies can ventilation energy demand be optimised without causing harm or discomfort. The purpose of this paper is to review aspects of indoor air quality as they relate to the ventilation of commercial buildings. Also outlined is a variety of energy efficient approaches to ventilation.

The suitability of night ventilation for cooling is first discussed by presenting a plot of summer weather conditions on the bioclimatic chart by reporting on the results of energy and ventilation simulations of a typical UK office module. The development of a simplified design tool suitable for the early stages of design process is then described. For this model, user input is limited to a few key variables and the technique allows the designer to explore rapidly the effects of a range of design variables including external temperatures, internal gains and ventilation rates during the day and night.

A CFD software called VORTEX is used as a tool to simulate air flow and thermal comfort in naturally wind ventilated classrooms of an educational institution, which are a different locations, have different configurations and slightly differing outdoor environmental conditions. Simulations of the various classrooms are compared to get the most thermally comfortable and uncomfortable naturally ventilated classroom. An analysis of the simulations will be done, taking into consideration, among other, location of inlets and outlets and the sheltering effect of the surrounding built-up environments. Recommendations will then be made on how to improve the ventilation of the least comfortable room, based on hypothetical simulation results.

The paper discusses the possibility of offering thermal comfort, without inducing mechanical energy costs, in new habitations, built in European style and situated in a hot and humid climate, by means of a construction elements: the Roof Solar Collector (RSC), which is made by using concrete roofing tiles on the outer side and gypsum board on the inner one. With this RSC it is possible, on the one hand, to minimize the fraction of the solar flux absorbed by the dwelling (insulation) and, on the other hand, to induce a natural ventilation which allows thermal comfort. The influence of length and tilt angle of the RSC on the performance of the RSC is studied experimentally. The results of the study, with regard to the natural ventilation of habitation, were that the optimum length of roof solar collector must be shorter than about 100 cm and the tilt angle should equal 30 degrees. The natural ventilation rate was about 0.08-0.15 m cubed s-1.m-2

Energy conservation in drying and processing operations is essential in order to improve the reliability of low and moderate temperature renewable energy system, and to reduce operating costs and energy consumption is systems using high-energy content fossil fuels in farms and processing plants especially in industrialized economics. An experimental evaluation of energy conservation potential by recirculating exhaust air in a commercial heated-air batch hay dryer is presented. The design of the exhaust recirculation unit is such that only about 30% of the total exhaust air is recirculated through the heater inlet. Experimental tests were conducted on the dryer with and without exhaust air recirculation. Maximum energy savings of 27% and 17% were achieved with exhaust air recirculation during fall and summer dryer operation respectively.

This paper describes the experimental set-up of a computerized data-acquisition system in the town of Shah Alam, Malaysia. The system utilizes sensors for the capture of global horizontal solar radiation, relative humidity of air, ambient air temperature, wind speed and direction. These parameters are then displayed and plotted directly on both the bio-climatic and psychometric charts. Some initial attempts are made to describe the typical climate of Shah Alam by interpreting the resultant points on the charts. Consequently, as more data is acquired over a considerable period of time, sufficient to describe the Shah Alam more accurately, passive design strategies for cooling to achieve local thermal comfort may be attempted.

The indigenous courtyard houses of Baghdad are effectively designed and built as two-houses-in-one micro-climatically and thermal-environmentally (as well as in other aspects). Essentially, the ground floor, the semi-subterranean level, the subterranean level, and the roof terrace at second floor level are designed and built for summer habitation, while the first floor (with its mezzanine level the Kashif-Kan) is designed and built for winter habitation. Additionally, habitable rooms and spaces of these indigenous courtyard houses in Baghdad are not designated for a specific function, purpose, or use: instead, they are envisaged as multi-purpose to be used for sitting, living, dining, sleeping, and some are even for receiving visitors. However, they are designated according to season when they are meant to be used mainly in winter or summer or alternatively in spring and autumn, \9and some are even designated for use at a particular time of the day within the same season, as discussed in another paper submitted to the Congress). In this paper, such habitable rooms and spaces are identified in plan, in location (floor level), and in section, and then related to their seasonal designation.

The use of passive solar cooling strategies offer real opportunities for improving the ambient comfort conditions in building whilst reducing the energy consumption due to the use of mechanical systems for space climatization. This research examines the potential of passive solar cooling strategies in an educational building. The alternatives proposed for investigation consisted of a wind tower system handling the temperature difference gradient and direct wind pressure effects. A new fenestration system on the south facade, implementation of an integrated energy efficient lighting system (including lamps, luminaries, ballasts and controls), and landscaping[ping features in a micro-climatic approach, to provide a pre-cooling effect, were also proposed as additional strategies. Results have shown that passive solar cooling has the potential to improve ambient comfort conditions in these type of building, dominated by large internal heat gain loads. Energy consumption die to electric lighting and mechanical space climatization was cut off by 60%. At this stage, and after the implementation of the techniques, monitoring of the ambient conditions will be conducted for a period of twelve months. It is also expected that the results of this research can be applied in other buildings with similar conditions in Mexico.

Extreme high an low summer and winter temperatures respectively in most parts of Botswana render the use of space conditioning devices mandatory. However, the use of such devices is not feasible in the low-cost housing sector, and the majority of the population face the severity of the climate. In this paper effects of passive solar building design parameters and building material on the indoor temperatures of a typical three bed-roomed, low-cost house are analyzed. By varying the design parameters and materials the mean-monthly maximum, minimum and average indoor temperatures without the use of space conditioning devices are simulated. An energy analysis software - CALPAS version 3 (1980) is used, and the parameters studied are the orientation, roof and wall insulation and colorful, glass area, thermal mass and ventilation. The conclusions drawn and the recommendations made provide guidelines for home-owners to construct thermally more comfortable passive solar houses without or with very little additional cost of construction. This paper and another one by Jain et al. (1996) in these proceedings share common information and data, and should be considered together.
