Crypto helps &amp; hurts Jurassic Park production <p>

Subject: Crypto and Jurassic Park <p>

Here is an anecdote about the use of cryptography taken
from "The Beauty in the Beasts" an article by Jody Duncan on
page 95 of the magazine "Cinefex". <p>

Principal (sic) photography on Jurassic Park wrapped just after
 the Thanksgiving weekend. In the six months that followed,
 the film was editted, scored, mixed for sound and provided
 with finalized computer graphics dinosaurs. Already on to his
 next project-- Schindler's List-- Speilberg was shooting in
 Europe throughout most of the postproduction phase, but continued
 to keep his hand in Jurassic Park through an encrypted satellite
 feed from ILM (Industrial Lights and Magic). <p>

Maybe these folks need some stronger crypto.  I got a call from a
Cypherpunk on assignment in France.  He said that he had been
involved in an unauthorized capture and decryption some of those
very same digital dinosaurs.  He said they were "pretty cool."  I
got the impression the cracking wasn't very difficult.  Maybe
Speilberg and ILM need some expert help.  Another Cypherpunk
business opportunity? <p>
