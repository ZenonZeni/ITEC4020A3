        size="3">to improve the effectiveness of medication
        therapy by providing Pharmaceutical Care. While this term
        permeates the pharmacy literature, few others understand
        its implications. Pharmaceutical care involves far more
        than patient counseling. Specialized services may include
        such areas as <img src="images/beekers.jpg" align="right"
        hspace="0" width="200" height="280"></font><font size="3">
        asthma and allergy care, diabetes care, home health
        management, and human &amp; veterinary compounding.<br>
        Pharmaceutical compounding is the preparation of a
        customized medication dosage or dosage form to meet a
        specific patient need. Asthma programs involve
        elimination of asthma triggers and teaching the proper
        use of metered dose inhalers, peak flow meters, etc., as
        well as a complete medication history review. Diabetes
        care may involve self monitoring as well as education in
        areas of exercise and nutrition, often utilizing the
        expertise of individuals such as a Certified Diabetes
        Educator (CDE).<br>
        While the trend toward managed care tends to diminish the
        reality of specific patient needs, pharmaceutical care
        involves working on an individual basis with patient and
        physician to meet these unique needs, thereby improving
        the outcome of medical therapy. Interestingly, these
        interventions have also been shown to reduce overall
        healthcare costs. We welcome the opportunity to work with
        you and answer any questions.<br>

        size="3">Elliot et al. Of Cornell University Medical
        College showed that dextromethorphan, an NMDA receptor
        antagonist, can modulate morphine-mediated analgesic
        tolerance. Administration of subcutaneous
        dextromethorphan (but not saline) prior to an escalating
        morphine dosage schedule prevented a 5-fold increase in
        the morphine ED50 value observed on treatment day 4. In a
        trial involving morphine tolerant mice, administration of
        dextromethorphan resulted in an almost complete return of
        the morphine ED50 value to the opiod na&iuml;ve value.

        In a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, Maizels
        et al. Showed that a 4% solution of intranasal lidocaine
        gave rapid and complete relief of headache pain in 55% of
        a community urgent care sample of patients with acute
        migraine. Effect usually occurred within 5 minutes and
        nausea and photophobia were similarly relieved. The
        relapse rate (42%) was similar to that reported from
        sumatriptin, but onset of relapse of lidocaine was
        usually within one hour. However, 58% of lidocaine
        responders had persistent symptom relief for 24 hours or
        more. The theoretical site of action for intranasal
        lidocaine is the sphenopalatine ganglion SPG). (JAMA July

        Several clinical trials have shown that 4-aminopyridine
        may be helpful in treating one form of fatigue that
        occurs in multiple sclerosis. Fatigue is the single most
        common symptom experienced by people with MS, There are
        several types of fatigue that occur in multiple
        sclerosis. Four-AP appears to be particularly helpful in
        nerve fiber fatigue. In multiple sclerosis, the
        insulating myelin coverings of nerve fibers are destroyed
        leaving naked or demyelinated nerve fibers that are very
        sensitive to body temperature changes and fatigue easily.
        Because of nerve fiber fatigue, multiple sclerosis
        patients often notice that there is a limit to the
        distance they can walk or the time they can work with
        their hands. They also commonly notice worsening of their
        symptoms if they experience a fever, hot weather or as
        the day goes on. Demyelinated nerve fibers may work more
        efficiently and be less susceptible to fatigue when MS
        patients take 4-AP. Research on 4-AP demonstated that is
        improved function prone to nerve fiber fatigue in some MS
        patients. However, 4-AP does have side-effects such as
        dizziness, tingling sensations and in rare cases,
        seizures. It has been difficult to find the right dose
        since patients must take enough to have positive effects
        but not too much as it can cause seizures. Elan
        Pharmaceutical Company, which holds the marketing rights
        for this medication, is continuing to attempt to find the
        optimal dose. Though the Food and Drug Administration has
        not approved 4-AP for use in humans, 4-AP is available
        through several pharmacies in the United States.<br>
