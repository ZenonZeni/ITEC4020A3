    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning, everyone.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We have no preliminary, anything?

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I don't think so.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So we'll proceed with plaintiffs'

    18           case.

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  Good morning, your Honors, the

    20           plaintiffs call Professor Donna Hoffman.

    21                    THE COURT CLERK:  Will you please state and spell

    22           your name?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Donna L. Hoffman, D-o-n-n-a L. 

    24           H-o-f-f-m-a-n.

    25                    THE COURT CLERK:  Please raise your right hand.

                                                                             4

     1                    DONNA L. HOFFMAN, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

     2                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, please be seated.

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, I'd move into evidence the

     4           declaration of Professor Hoffman which was signed on March

     5           15, 1996, and previously filed in this court as her direct

     6           testimony.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection from the

     8           Government?

     9                    MR. BARON:  Yes, we object, your Honor.

    10                    THE COURT:  Okay, then you better come forward and

    11           tell us why.

    12                    MR. BARON:  I'd appreciate the opportunity for voir

    13           dire.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, well, certainly to the extent

    15           you object, to the extent of you wanted some voir dire?

    16                    MR. BARON:  Yes.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Mr. Hansen, I was curious

    18           myself.  Dr. Hoffman is offered as an expert in what area? 

    19           It doesn't say in her declaration.

    20                    MR. HANSEN:  I apologize, your Honor.  Dr. Hoffman

    21           is an expert in the marketing aspects of cyberspace and the

    22           nature of cyberspace as it relates to marketing and usage.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So that would be in the

    24           marketing of cyberspace and --

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  And the nature of cyberspace.

                                                                             5

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The nature of cyberspace.  Okay, by

     2           all means, Mr. Baron.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me just for a minute.  

     4                    (Discussion off the record.)

     5                    MR. BARON:  Good morning, your Honors.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning.

     7                    MR. BARON:  Good morning, Professor Hoffman.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Good morning.

     9                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    10           BY MR. BARON:  

    11           Q   Your expertise is as a Professor of Marketing, is it not?

    12           A   Yes, I'm a Professor of Management in the Marketing

    13           Division at the Owens School at Vanderbilt University.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron, we know who you are but

    15           because it's a new day's tape, maybe you should tell the

    16           tape.

    17                    MR. BARON:  O for two on that.  Yes, my name is

    18           Jason R. Baron, B-a-r-o-n, U.S. Department of Justice.  Than

    19           you, your Honor.

    20           BY MR. BARON:  

    21           Q   Professor Hoffman, you study strategic implications of

    22           commercializing new communications media, do you not?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   Your CV which is I believe Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 in this

    25           case lists no peer reviewed references concerning empirical

                                                                             6

     1           studies or surveys that you have conducted on the amount of

     2           pornography on the Internet, is that right?

     3           A   Yes, that's correct.

     4           Q   Nor are there any references on your CV to any surveys at

     5           all that you have conducted on the Internet, correct?

     6           A   There's no peer reviewed published studies of any surveys

     7           yet, that's correct.

     8           Q   Or non-peer reviewed?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   Studies that you have conducted?

    11           A   Right, not yet, that's -- we're in the process of a paper

    12           right now but it is not submitted for peer review.

    13           Q   Your CV doesn't contain any references to studies you

    14           have done concerning the extent of pornography in

    15           communication media other than the Internet, is that correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   In fact, as you stated in your deposition this past

    18           Monday, you are not interested in pornography as a research

    19           area, correct?

    20           A   Yes, that's correct.

    21           Q   Would you turn to Paragraph 122 of your declaration which

    22           has been submitted in this action?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   You state in this declaration that it is your, quote,

    25           "impression," unquote, that there is a decreasing percentage

                                                                             7

     1           of the material in cyberspace that is sexually explicit, is

     2           that correct?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Let me turn to your deposition of Monday at Page 185.  In

     5           response to a question, this was starting around Line 13, in

     6           response to my question asking you that you will say that it

     7           is your impression regarding the amount of sexually explicit

     8           material in cyberspace, you answered: "Based on my own

     9           experience," this is Line 15, "and observation and the

    10           experience and observations of others who are Net veterans,

    11           that is the conventional wisdom."

    12                    Question:  "You're relying on conventional wisdom to

    13           make those observations?"

    14                    Answer:  "Yes, and experience."

    15                    Question:  "And experience?"

    16                    Answer:  "Yes."

    17                    Question:  "Including your experience in looking at

    18           particular sites on the Net?"

    19                    Answer:  "Right."

    20                    Question: "But not in a systematic matter?"

    21                    Answer: "Correct."

    22                    Question:  "Not in a scientific sample?"

    23                    Answer:  "Right.  And using -- that's correct,

    24           that's right."

    25                    Question:  "These are impressions?"

                                                                             8

     1                    Answer:  "These are impressions."

     2                    Question:  "Unquantified?"

     3                    Answer:  "Unquantified."

     4                    Did you state that testimony?

     5           A   Yes, I did.  And I --

     6                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.  

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honor, I'd like the witness to be

     8           able to finish her response to that question.  I believe she

     9           thought that the question required or the answer required

    10           elaboration.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Go ahead.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  I've been studying the strategic

    13           marketing implications of commercializing emerging media like

    14           the World Wide Web on the Internet since 1983.  I've been co-

    15           director of a sponsored research center since 1994, so for

    16           the past three years I've been studying activity on the World

    17           Wide Web.

    18                    One of the papers that we have written, the

    19           commercial scenarios paper, "Opportunities and Challenges"

    20           which is published in a peer review journal, examines all of

    21           the commercial Web sites for the purpose of categorizing

    22           them.  In the process of preparing that paper and all the

    23           other papers that we have published I have extensive

    24           experience surfing the Web both professionally and personally

    25           and my impressions are based on that professional experience.

                                                                             9

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me, don't --  

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you can sit back.  You don't

     3           need to get close to the microphone, it's extremely

     4           sensitive.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Sorry, okay.

     6           BY MR. BARON:   

     7           Q   Professor Hoffman, have you published any article on the

     8           subject of anonymous remailing on the Internet?

     9           A   No.

    10           Q   Have you conducted any studies on anonymous remailing on

    11           the Internet?

    12           A   No.

    13                    MR. BARON:  Your Honors, I would submit at this time

    14           that Professor Hoffman is an expert with respect to the

    15           commercialization of the Net and marketing questions. 

    16           However, to the extent she presents testimony today on her

    17           impressions regarding pornography on the Internet, they are

    18           as a lay person and not as an expert.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, well, that point is noted

    20           and I'm sure you'll develop it further in your cross-

    21           examination of Dr. Hoffman.

    22                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But I take it, based on what you

    24           said, you do not dispute that she is qualified as an expert

    25           in the marketing of cyberspace and the nature of cyberspace,

                                                                            10

     1           at least commercial cyberspace?

     2                    MR. BARON:  We don't dispute that.  Let me make it

     3           very specific.  When I objected to her declaration, parsing

     4           the declaration in terms of the area of her expertise and the

     5           area that she's giving lay testimony we would submit that

     6           Paragraphs 114 through 132 of her declaration are not expert

     7           opinion.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  114 through 132.  Well, you can

     9           certainly develop that in detail in your cross-examination if

    10           you'd like, but I see your point.

    11                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    13           BY MR. BARON:  

    14           Q   Good morning, Professor Hoffman.

    15           A   Good morning.

    16           Q   You have studied the Internet from a marketing

    17           perspective, correct?

    18           A   Yes, from a marketing perspective and from a

    19           communications perspective.

    20           Q   And you specifically studied the commercialization of the

    21           Net, correct?

    22           A   One of my research interest has to do with the

    23           commercialization of the World Wide Web on the Internet,

    24           that's correct.  Another one of my research interests has to

    25           do with how consumers behave in this environment and how

                                                                            11

     1           people communicate in this environment.

     2           Q   And you've coined a few terms along the way, have you

     3           not?

     4           A   Yes.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Not acronyms, I hope.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  No -- well, sort of.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    MR. BARON:  In part, your Honors, in part.

     9           BY MR. BARON:  

    10           Q   Would you turn to Page 25 -- sorry, Paragraph 25 of your

    11           declaration and could you please explain to the Court what

    12           you are referring to by the term in italics, "Hyper media

    13           computer mediated environment (CME)"?

    14           A   The term "hyper media computer mediated environment,

    15           which I agree is a mouthful, which is why we've shortened it

    16           to CME which is much easier to say has to do with the idea of

    17           defining a new medium like the World Wide Web on the Internet

    18           as a communications medium in which people can both provide

    19           an access, multi-media content that is also hyperlinked.  

    20                    So in other words, from the demonstration we saw

    21           yesterday, the information that's available on the Webpage is

    22           what we would call hypermedia because there's sound

    23           information there, there's textual information there, there's

    24           information contained in the context of these hyperlinks or

    25           hot links and all of this information is available in what we

                                                                            12

     1           call a distributed computer environment.  

     2                    So it's an environment in which people can

     3           communicate with each other but that communication is

     4           mediated or takes place through a computer.  So that's the

     5           context or the sense in which we mean computer mediated

     6           environment or CME because it's designed to illustrate the

     7           idea that when people are communicating, the communication is

     8           through the computer or when they're providing content

     9           through the medium, that computer mediates the content or

    10           mediates the way they access the content.  So, for example,

    11           the point and click with the mouse movement or putting the

    12           information on the computer.

    13           Q   Would one example of sound on the Internet be Internet

    14           Talk Radio?

    15           A   Yes, that would be one example of audio or sound.  Now--

    16           Q   And what's your understanding of Internet Talk Radio?

    17           A   Well, in a -- in a non-technical sense?

    18           Q   Yes.

    19           A   My understanding of Internet Talk Radio is that it is an

    20           application which is very much like radio but is served up or

    21           facilitated in a computer environment so that information is

    22           stored on someone's computer which is in the context of sound

    23           and then a person can click on a link which has to do with

    24           that talk radio and then listen to whatever has been

    25           programmed by someone.

                                                                            13

     1           Q   Thank you.  If you could turn to Paragraph 44 of your

     2           declaration, you have in italics the term "Telepresence

     3           View," unquote, of mediated communication.  Could you inform

     4           the Court what you're referring to there?

     5           A   Yes.  First I should say I did not invent the term

     6           "telepresence," that was attributed to Jonathan Steuer who

     7           wrote his doctoral dissertation at Stanford on that topic. 

     8           However, it's a very interesting concept and the idea is that

     9           there are two different ways that people can perceive that

    10           they're in an environment.  One way is what we might call the

    11           presence view, in other words, I perceive that I am in this

    12           physical environment and so I have a presence of being here. 

    13           The other way is that I can have a telepresence view, in

    14           other words, I can have a perception that I am in the

    15           mediated environment, in other words, that I am involved in

    16           what's happening on the World Wide Web.  And both of those

    17           perceptions can take place when people are interacting in a

    18           computer-mediated environment like the World Wide Web.

    19           Q   Could you also turn to now Paragraph 73 of your

    20           declaration, that's on Page 17, and --

    21           A   I'm sorry, would you repeat the paragraph, please?

    22           Q   Paragraph 73. 

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 17.

    24           BY MR. BARON:  

    25           Q   And inform the Court what you mean by the concept of,

                                                                            14

     1           quote, "flow," f-l-o-w, unquote, in terms of an individual's

     2           experience on the Net.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Why don't you put on that light, Mr.

     4           Hansen, so she can see better?  That little light.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The thing under the green.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Known as a lamp.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's very old-fashioned.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  L-a-m-p stands for nothing.

    10                    (Laughter.)

    11                    MR. BARON:  Don't be so sure, your Honor.

    12                    (Laughter.)

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Touche.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, the concept of flow was first

    15           developed by a psychologist who developed it in the context

    16           of activities like, for example, rock climbing, playing

    17           chess, dancing, listening to music and other sorts of

    18           activities like that.  And the idea -- and we have extended

    19           it to describe what happens in computer-mediated environments

    20           when people are engaging in interactive relationships in

    21           those environments.  

    22                    And it is a process or an experience that

    23           individuals engage in and the first thing that happens is

    24           people pay attention to what's going on in the environment,

    25           then they have an experience of being totally immersed in the

                                                                            15

     1           environment which they perceive as being very enjoyable.

     2                    As a consequence of engaging in this flow experience

     3           a number of nice things happen.  For example, people report

     4           increased learning in the environment, they report being very

     5           satisfied by the experience in the environment, they engage

     6           in more exploratory and participatory behaviors which means

     7           they're more likely to try to explore and find out more

     8           things in the environment and they perceive a sense of being

     9           in control in the environment.

    10                    So we have used the construct or the concept of flow

    11           to describe how people experience being in an environment

    12           like the World Wide Web.

    13           BY MR. BARON:  

    14           Q   And finally, Professor Hoffman, in terms of definitions

    15           what do you mean by these terms that you've referred to in

    16           your writings as information bank or knowledge base for

    17           future memory?  Are you familiar with those terms?

    18           A   Yes, you're talking about the external memory concept

    19           that we've developed, is that correct?

    20           Q   I believe so.

    21           A   The idea there is in an environment like the World Wide

    22           Web there is a unique facility for people to be able to

    23           remember things without having to write them down and that is

    24           through the Bookmark facility which is a feature of browsers

    25           like Netscape, for example.

                                                                            16

     1                    So as I am surfing, for example, through the World

     2           Wide Web and I move through cyberspace clicking on links that

     3           attract my interest or that I'd like to learn more about, if

     4           I see something that I want to remember because I might want

     5           to come back another time, I can store it in my Bookmark, as

     6           we saw our demonstration yesterday.

     7                    And in a marketing or consumer context that could

     8           lead to what we call external memory because in a, for

     9           example, a product purchase sense, if I see some information

    10           about an automobile and I want to go back at another time,

    11           maybe I'm interested in buying a Saab but today I'm just

    12           going to surf but get some information about it but maybe

    13           next week I want to go back because I don't remember where

    14           that link was, but the Bookmark facility allows me to

    15           remember without having to store it up here and we call that

    16           external memory.

    17           Q   Would it be fair to say --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me.

    19                    MR. BARON:  Oh, sorry.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is user net navigation as you use it

    21           in here synonymous with surf?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  One part, surfing is one part of the

    23           network navigation or user navigation experience.  We

    24           identify two types of network navigation, one which we call

    25           experiential which is browsing or surfing just for fun, just

                                                                            17

     1           to sort of see what's out there and it's something we would

     2           consider to be very ritualized, or in the psychological

     3           parlance something we call hedonic which means it's fun and

     4           we, you know, get a lot of pleasure from it.

     5                    The other type of user navigation or network

     6           navigation we refer to as goal directed and not that that

     7           wouldn't be fun, but in other words, I have a purpose, I am

     8           looking specifically for some information about Saabs today.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Got it, thank you.

    10           BY MR. BARON:  

    11           Q   Would it be fair to say, Professor Hoffman, that your

    12           work in this area involves how adults as opposed to children

    13           experience the World Wide Web and the Internet?

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   There aren't any studies, are there, on whether children

    16           have a similar flow experience in the context of a hypermedia

    17           computer mediated environment, correct?

    18           A   That's correct.

    19           Q   And so far as you are aware there has been no scholarly

    20           research done on children's ability to build an information

    21           memory bank or bookmarks, as you said, based on experiences

    22           good and bad while on the net, correct?

    23           A   That's correct.

    24           Q   Please tell the Court what you mean by Net surfing? 

    25           There was a question but why don't we go over it again.

                                                                            18

     1           A   By surfing I mean the process of, as I said before,

     2           experiential behavior or activities on the World Wide Web by

     3           browsing for information in which I have no particular goal

     4           to find a particular piece of information and there's two

     5           important components of the surfing process.  One could be

     6           I'm surfing or browsing because I have an enduring or an

     7           ongoing relationship with the computer, so it's the computer

     8           itself that I'm interested in and I just surf every day

     9           because I like the computer, for example.

    10                    The other type of surfing or browsing behavior could

    11           occur -- and these aren't mutually exclusive -- would be that

    12           I have an enduring or an ongoing interest with the sorts of

    13           things that I'm surfing for.  So those might be information

    14           about automobiles or information about stocks, financial

    15           information, information about companies, scholarly

    16           information, you know, there's an entire gamut of things.

    17                    And so maybe tomorrow I'm -- or today I would surf

    18           for information and see what was the latest information in an

    19           on-line magazine, for example, or I might want to find

    20           something about my favorite writer, that sort of thing.  And

    21           so it's not particularly direct and I'm not looking for

    22           something specific, I just want to see what's out there in a

    23           general sense.

    24           Q   Would it be fair to say -- well, let me read you a

    25           portion of your deposition and see whether you agree to it. 

                                                                            19

     1           This is on this point.  I'm paraphrasing from Page 72, Line

     2           3.  "If you are looking just to browse to just look for

     3           something for fun, say, because you're interested in cars,

     4           for example, but nothing specific, you might enter the word

     5           cars and then tens of thousands of documents would appear and

     6           you would choose one of those and you would click on it and

     7           off, click on and off, and that would take you to a

     8           particular Web site, whatever caught your fancy.  From there

     9           you could click on something else and go somewhere else, you

    10           can go using the back key, for example, or one of the browser

    11           navigation aids, a Netscape."

    12                    Tell the Court that in the deposition is a third

    13           tense rather than first tense, but is that statement correct?

    14           A   Yes, it's correct.

    15           Q   Okay.  Thank you.  Now, children under the age of 18 Net

    16           surf, don't they?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   At the deposition this past Monday however you stated

    19           that you know, quote, "next to nothing," unquote, about the

    20           behavior of children on the Internet, correct?

    21           A   That's correct.

    22           Q   You haven't studied what kind of use children make of the

    23           World Wide Web, correct?

    24           A   That's correct. 

    25           Q   Or any of the other Internet applications including FTP,

                                                                            20

     1           Usenet, Gofer, et cetera, correct?

     2           A   That's correct.

     3           Q   Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 57, the books are

     4           on your left at the bottom, and it's the second volume?  MR.

     5           BARON:  It's in the second volume, your Honors.

     6           BY MR. BARON:  

     7           Q   Do you see Exhibit 57?

     8           A   Yes, I do.

     9           Q   Could you describe for the Court what this is?

    10           A   This is a -- we might call it a newsletter or a summary

    11           example of some research that's being conducted at Carnegie

    12           Mellon University under the name of Homenet and it's a five-

    13           year or they're hoping five-year but right now it's multi-

    14           year field trial of residential Internet use in the

    15           Pittsburgh area.

    16           Q   The Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie

    17           Mellon is a respected research center and institution,

    18           correct?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   If you would turn to what is Subpart 4.4 on Page 3 of

    21           this exhibit?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   The subsection says "Teens Lead the Family," do you see

    24           that?

    25           A   Yes, I do.

                                                                            21

     1           Q   Is it correct to say that the study found that the

     2           heaviest use -- users of the Net in 48 families studied were

     3           teenage children?

     4           A   Yes, that's correct.

     5           Q   Do you rely on this study in your own research as what

     6           you consider to be the first credible study of the

     7           consumption experience in the home regarding the Internet?

     8           A   Yes.  I use this study as background information for both

     9           the empirical work that we're conducting and our theoretical

    10           work because it is the first study that has actually put

    11           computers in the home.  However, the study has to be

    12           qualified on a number of important dimensions.  One is it's

    13           taking place in the Pittsburgh area which is a major urban

    14           center in the United States.  Another is that it only has 48

    15           families and so that is an extremely small sample, so we have

    16           to be very careful about drawing broad conclusions about

    17           behavior.  However, I think the results are very interesting

    18           and can be useful for suggesting some trends.

    19                    Another qualification or limitation is that the

    20           families were solicited on the basis of locating high school

    21           students who were on the school papers at the high schools

    22           that they attended so you would expect that these journalism

    23           students in high school and being editors of the paper or

    24           else writers for the paper would be lead users of the

    25           computer.  So in that sense the results will suggest what's

                                                                            22

     1           happening with lead users or pioneers and are not indicative

     2           of the general population.

     3           Q   May I ask that you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 44 which

     4           may be in the first volume by your side?  My apologies, I

     5           think your exhibits are in both volumes so we're going to go

     6           back and forth. 

     7           A   That's okay.

     8                    (Pause.)

     9           A   Okay.

    10           Q   Do you recall my showing you what are statistics from the

    11           Census Bureau?

    12           A   Yes, I do.

    13           Q   If you would turn to page 2 of the exhibit, do you see

    14           the Table A, "Level of Access and Use of Computers: 1984,

    15           1989 and 1993," where the numbers are in thousands?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   Maybe it would be helpful, can you summarize just what

    18           this table is attempting to get at?

    19           A   Yes.  This -- this is from the CPS or the current

    20           population census from 1993, I believe, and what it is

    21           attempting to show are the trends in access and use of

    22           computers in the United States over the last decade or so for

    23           children and for adults.  Would you like me to say more?

    24           Q   You stated in your deposition that while you didn't

    25           dispute these figures, to you they represented an upper

                                                                            23

     1           bound, correct?

     2           A   Yes, that's correct.  I do research on the use and access

     3           of the Internet and am engaged right now in an empirical

     4           study of those aspects and in fact a very interesting

     5           research question from my perspective is what it means to ask

     6           someone if they have access to a computer and what are they

     7           thinking when you ask them that question and what sort of

     8           information do you get.  And also what does it mean when you

     9           ask someone if they use a computer and what sort of

    10           information you get.  And one conclusion we are coming to is

    11           that the access question is an upper bound on use because it

    12           tends to evoke an awareness type of response.

    13                    When you ask someone if they have access to

    14           something it seems to suggest in their minds, oh, well, I

    15           know about it, I'm aware of it, yeah, I have access because

    16           my neighbor down the street has a computer and so in that

    17           sense I believe I might have access.

    18                    The use question tends to be more, a little bit more

    19           specific because now you're actually asking somebody do you

    20           actually use a computer and so as you can see from the table

    21           here for 1993 the access figures are higher than the use

    22           figures.  And so you expect to see this winnowing down effect

    23           as you get more specific in the type of usage questions you

    24           ask someone and in fact I would expect -- and these data do

    25           not show it because they're so aggregate -- that if we say

                                                                            24

     1           well, do you use a computer every day the number would be

     2           much, much smaller.

     3           Q   All right, well, thank you.  These --

     4           A   You know, I have a point to make about this table which I

     5           noticed which is -- I'm sorry, may I?

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, excuse me.  

     7                    (Discussion off the record.)

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, there's no objection.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I'm sure --

    10                    MR. BARON:  I have no objection, your Honor.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You have an objection?

    12                    MR. BARON:  I have no objection, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, he has no objection.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, go ahead.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  I -- the point that I want to make, I

    17           think, illustrates the difficulties involved in trying to

    18           measure access and use of computer networks or use of

    19           computers or use of the Internet.  For example, if you'll

    20           look at column -- the first set of numbers under "Number" and

    21           you'll see 1993, it says "Do you have access to a computer,"

    22           it's for three to 17 year olds, and the number given is

    23           17,829,000 people in the United States in 1993 between the

    24           ages of three and 17 are estimated to have access.  And yet

    25           and then you look at do you use a computer and you see that

                                                                            25

     1           12 million say they use a home computer, 28 million say they

     2           use a computer at school and then 32 million say they use it

     3           at anyplace and the figure seems somewhat out of whack

     4           because it's so much higher that they would use it anyplace

     5           and you wonder what those other places are, particularly for

     6           three to 17 year olds.  And so it just reflects some of the

     7           difficulties, I think, involved in trying to tap these --

     8           using these sorts of statistics for anything more than

     9           looking at trends, at least at this point in time.

    10           BY MR. BARON:  

    11           Q   All right, well, thank you.  Now, you state in your

    12           declaration that the Internet is unique, that it's very

    13           different than other media, correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   As one of the ways that you pointed out that the Internet

    16           is unique is that it's essentially a 24-hour a day, seven day

    17           a week medium?

    18           A   Yes, that's correct.

    19           Q   URL's are always there in cyberspace, correct?

    20           A   Well, they're there as long as the computer behind them

    21           hasn't shut down, that's correct.

    22           Q   Okay.  And one of the features you've emphasized here

    23           today in your deposition that is how easy and sometimes how

    24           fun it is to Net surf, correct?

    25           A   Yes, that's correct.

                                                                            26

     1           Q   There's a popular search engine for Net surfing called

     2           "Alta Vista," correct?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Could you turn to Paragraph 66 of your declaration? 

     5           Paragraph 66 which is on Page 15 at the bottom, I'll read the

     6           first two sentences:

     7                    "The Web differs from broadcast media like

     8           television and radio in two important respects.  First on the

     9           Web individuals must seek out the information they want to

    10           consume, individuals do not passively receive information nor

    11           does information suddenly appear surprising them."

    12                    That's your statement, correct?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   Let's say a child or a teenager was performing a surf,

    15           surfing the Net in response to let's say a book project in

    16           school, okay?

    17           A   Okay.

    18           Q   Let's say the book that they were interested in learning

    19           more about because either they had read the book or because

    20           they had seen the book was Little Women by Louisa Mae Alcott,

    21           okay?

    22           A   Okay.

    23           Q   What would the child or the adolescent do in terms of

    24           surfing the Net in terms of a simple search using Yahoo or

    25           Infoseek or Alta Vista or some other search engine, what

                                                                            27

     1           would they do?

     2           A   Well, first of all, it would depend on the child.  If we

     3           go back to the concept of flow for a moment, it's a very

     4           important idea to recognize that in computer mediated

     5           environments there is a competency issue that is introduced

     6           that is not relevant in the physical world, particularly for

     7           the use of other media.  And so this competency issue

     8           involves the idea that people have a set of skills that they

     9           have to bring to the environment in order to be able to

    10           facilitate navigating through it.  And the environment itself

    11           also presents challenges to the individual as they're trying

    12           to navigate.

    13                    And so what a child would do would depend on the age

    14           of the child, the child's characteristics and particularly

    15           their competency to navigate through this environment.

    16           Q   Assuming that the child knew how to type words into a

    17           browser or search engine?

    18           A   So we're talking about a child that's literate, computer

    19           literate --

    20           Q   Right.

    21           A   -- and old enough to understand the Netscape browsing

    22           concept?

    23           Q   Right.

    24           A   And the concept of search agents?

    25           Q   To search for Little Women what words do you put into the

                                                                            28

     1           browser or what do you type into Infoseek or Alta Vista?

     2           A   If I were -- if I were instructing my child, for example,

     3           on a book report -- my child is too young to do this but if

     4           my child were older -- then we would go to Netscape, we would

     5           go Alta Vista and then in advanced search cause I would help

     6           him do this we would enter "Little" plus "Women" plus

     7           "Louisa" plus "Mae" plus "Alcott."  Actually we would use the

     8           "and" key and then we would get all of the documents from the

     9           22 million documents that are referenced in Alta Vista, we

    10           would get the documents that satisfy that criteria.  That's

    11           what I would do with my child.

    12           Q   Can you turn to what -- now we've marked this as Exhibit

    13           13A and with the Court's indulgence, it does not have a

    14           separate tab in these books, it's found as the second

    15           document under Tab 13.

    16                    (Pause.)

    17           Q   Do you see that document?

    18           A   Yes, I do.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's the one that has "Win a trip to

    20           Hawaii" on it?

    21                    MR. BARON:  Yes, correct, your Honor.

    22                    (Laughter.)

    23           BY MR. BARON:  

    24           Q   Are you generally familiar with this form of document as

    25           produced by Infoseek?

                                                                            29

     1           A   Yes, I am.

     2           Q   Would you take a look at the fifth entry on this

     3           document?

     4           A   Yes, I see it.

     5           Q   This document was produced by typing in the words "Little

     6           Women" correct?

     7           A   Yes, that appears to be the case because at the top it

     8           says "Search for" and then in the bold, the two words,

     9           "Little Women" and that had produced a search for all

    10           documents on the Internet that have the words "little" in

    11           them or have the words "women" in them in the title in the

    12           URL.  

    13           Q   And what does the fifth entry represent?

    14           A   You want me to read it?

    15           Q   Yes, please.

    16           A   "See hot pictures of naked women," exclamation point.

    17           Q   Isn't it possible, Professor Hoffman, that a child might

    18           be surprised in stumbling across that entry in the context of

    19           an on-line search?  Isn't it possible?

    20           A   It's possible if the -- I -- it's possible that that

    21           child would be surprised.

    22           Q   Thank you.  Why don't we turn to the concept of hits when

    23           you're conducting a search.

    24           A   Okay.

    25           Q   Could you explain to the Court what a hit is?

                                                                            30

     1           A   Yes, a hit is a measure, it's a, literally it's an entry

     2           recorded in the server log of the computer that is the Web

     3           server that says a file has been accessed when someone comes

     4           to that particular page.  But the hits, there's quite a bit

     5           of controversy about the hits because, for example, on the

     6           home page for our center, Project 2000, when someone comes to

     7           that front page or the front door of our virtual research

     8           center, that counts as say ten hits.  

     9                    And the reason it counts as ten hits is because we

    10           have an image map, in other words, we have a picture on the

    11           front with some nice drawings on it and on the map itself you

    12           can click in different places and go to my curriculum vitae,

    13           go to Professor Novak's curriculum vitae, go to the Owens

    14           School's home page.

    15                    And so on and then there's a set of links that you

    16           can go to our research papers, you can go to some other

    17           people's research papers or whatever.  

    18                    In the process of serving up that front page, that

    19           records approximately ten hits on my server log.  So the hit,

    20           and that's the reason there's so much controversy over Web

    21           measurement, hits are not an accurate measure of how many

    22           people are coming to the Web site because depending on how

    23           many images I have on my front page or how many links I

    24           choose to put on the front page, I can inflate the number of

    25           hits.

                                                                            31

     1                    But a hit literally is a file served on that

     2           computer server.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Let me interrupt you for a second. 

     4           What if you came in the back door?  

     5                    THE WITNESS:  You mean to another page?

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In other words, if you came in

     7           through another link --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- rather than hitting the front

    10           page of your home page you found, for example, I mean what

    11           Mrs. Duvall gave us yesterday with the fragile X, as I recall

    12           it.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If you came in the back door to the

    15           fragile X foundation that way, would that be a hit?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that would also be a hit.  So,

    17           for example, fragile X has a home page but fragile X has many

    18           sites that are enduring and have lots of content on them,

    19           they might have thousands of pages.  Some very deep sites

    20           might have 10,000 pieces of information.

    21                    So each of those pages has a URL associated with it

    22           and then if someone were to come in, as you say, through one

    23           of these back doors because you knew the URL directly and you

    24           went directly to that page rather than going through the

    25           front door, that page itself could be served up at least as

                                                                            32

     1           one hit but again depends on how many things are on that

     2           particular page.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So in Project 2000's count, if

     4           someone comes in by what I call the back door and I think we

     5           agree it's called the back door to, say, Page 17 --

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there's --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- if there is a Page 17.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, there's not really a concept of

     9           Page 17 because one of the unique features of the Web is that

    10           it's not a linear.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, I understand that, but if you

    12           were to print it out in hard copy it would be Page 17, each

    13           screen.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, not necessarily because unless I

    15           particularly marked it to say Page 17, but --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  But it's a page, it's another page. 

    18           Not the, you know, cause there's lot-- literally think of it

    19           as a web and there's lots of different ways to meander

    20           through either a particular site in a non-linear fashion or

    21           through the entire Web.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, when you measure the hits,

    23           whatever their --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- inaccuracy may be, that also

                                                                            33

     1           includes the back door --

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it does.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- accesses, correct?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  In fact that's why we don't measure

     5           hits and that's why there's been for particularly for

     6           commercial purposes because this is a very hot topic with

     7           advertisers right now and advertising agencies.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  They want to know hits per thousand,

     9           right?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Right, and it's been completely, I

    11           mean there's very few firms now that either will sell space

    12           on a Web site on the basis of hits or will even talk in the

    13           context of hits because in the last year there's been so much

    14           attention, people have done a lot of work including the

    15           Project 2000 discussing why this is a very bad idea.

    16                    So instead what people do, there are several things. 

    17           So hits are really the upper bound.  I mean there's no more

    18           than the hits as the measure of what's happening on your Web

    19           site, but it's a completely useless measure from my

    20           perspective as a measure of activity from a consumer

    21           perspective.

    22                    The lower bound is what we call unique domains.  The

    23           server log also records when someone comes to the site

    24           there's their domain name attached to it.  So, for example,

    25           if I'm visiting a Web site I have my own domain and IP

                                                                            34

     1           address because I have my own machine connected directly to

     2           the Internet.  My address at Vanderbilt is

     3           Collett.OGSM.Vanderbilt.EDU, so whenever I go somewhere with

     4           my browser from my machine to another Web site anywhere in

     5           the world, the server log of those sites that

     6           Collett.OGSM.Vanderbilt.EDU went to the site.  It doesn't say

     7           Donna Hoffman went because they don't necessarily know it's

     8           me, they just know that machine went.  That is a domain.

     9                    So the server log for a particular site will record

    10           all those domains and it's very possible and very easy to

    11           write computer programs to count how many domains came in a

    12           day, in an hour to a page, to all the pages, to the home page

    13           and so on and then throw out the ones that are multiples.

    14                    So, for example, our site gets hit a lot by

    15           Gateway.Senate.GOV and -- but if they come more than once,

    16           first of all, I have no idea who it is, but if they come more

    17           than once I'll discount it once and say I had a unique visit

    18           today from Gateway.Senate.GOV and then I can count over time

    19           how many of those unique domains I had in a single day.

    20                    So the Project 2000 site gets anywhere from a

    21           thousand to two thousand or so, maybe 1800, unique domain

    22           visits a day.  It probably gets tens of thousands of hits,

    23           but that's irrelevant. What's much more important to know is

    24           how many lower bound people actually came to my site.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sorry to interrupt.

                                                                            35

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I get just one little

     2           clarification while we're doing it?  On this exhibit that

     3           doesn't have a page -- well, it does, it's one of two in 13A

     4           that you called our attention to, would any of these

     5           references be a hit even if the user, searcher, surfer 

     6           didn't click on them, if the page has come up would these be

     7           considered, would they all be considered hits or would none

     8           of them be considered hits until the person wants to link

     9           with the little hand?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, which one?  There's an

    12           either/or--

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, they would not be -- they would

    14           not be considered hits because for these search engines,

    15           Infoseek is not a -- is a directory.  And so when I go to

    16           Infoseek to search, for example, in this case or when he went

    17           to search for Little Women, that created a hit on Infoseek

    18           because somebody went to Infoseek and let's say you went and

    19           you had a domain associated with your computer, which you

    20           would, it would record that you were there.

    21                    Now, this page is served up from Infoseek's

    22           directory so there is no hit recorded for the WWW Women's

    23           Sport Page by Amy Lewis and so on.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  However, if you then choose to click

                                                                            36

     1           on one of these links you will be taken to that site and that

     2           would record a hit.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And you would have

     4           instructed your son, if you were helping your -- is it

     5           correct that you would have instructed your son if you were

     6           looking for Little Women to put "little" with an and?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would.  Well, first of all, I

     8           probably wouldn't use Infoseek, I would use -- but whatever. 

     9           But even Infoseek, I believe, allows you to use term -- I am

    10           blanking on the name, but symbols that allow you to refine

    11           your search because I would know, being an experienced user

    12           of the computer, that searching for the two words, "Little

    13           Women" would produce many more things than I would be

    14           interested in.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But is it true that a child might

    16           not know?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  It's true, but I think the reason is

    18           that I would be with my child educating him on how to use the

    19           computer and how to engage in these search processes, at

    20           least until I felt he was -- knew how to do it on his own.

    21                    So I would not let him sit there and do this.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But if your son were 12, let's say,

    23           and by now an experienced surfer, isn't it a fair assumption,

    24           as Chief Judge Sloviter is suggesting, that he would just

    25           type in Little Women?  That is the natural search.

                                                                            37

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Actually, I believe that if he were 12

     2           and an experienced surfer, particularly on the basis of my

     3           tutelage, he would know that it would be a waste of time to

     4           type in Little Women and because by then he would have moved

     5           through the processes we described in our search and he would

     6           have moved from being a browser to a more goal-directed user,

     7           he would be much more experienced.  

     8                    And if he knew what he was looking for he would know

     9           how to get to it. 

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But the point is the more naive the

    11           searcher, the more likely they are to pick up what Mr. Baron

    12           has called your attention to, isn't that the point?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I believe that's true, the more

    14           experienced they are, the more likely they would be to not

    15           know how to do sophisticated searches.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's particularly true of

    17           children, isn't it, who don't have the benefit of a parent

    18           who is an expert in this area?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, that would be more true, yes,

    20           that's true, but then there are also schools that instruct

    21           children on how to use the computers in the Internet and how

    22           to go through searching facilities and teach them the tools

    23           necessary to use the Internet as a communications tool.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think Mr. Baron was probably

    25           getting at the -- he was trying to get to the number of hits,

                                                                            38

     1           so while we'll let you go back to that then.

     2                    MR. BARON:  Well, this is an interesting discussion,

     3           but --

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, thank you.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We aim to please.

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7                    MR. BARON:  I want to add a layer of complexity to

     8           the subject of hits and I was going to go off on a different

     9           tangent which is to ask you to tell the Court what are "Bots"

    10           and what are "Spiders."

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Bots?

    12                    MR. BARON:  B-o-t-s.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's an acronym, right?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Not really.

    15                    MR. BARON:  I'll let Professor Hoffman describe it.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Bots or Robots, Bots for short.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A contraction.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  And Spiders and Intelligent Agents are

    19           a class of software programs that are tools that enable

    20           people to perform specific tasks on the World Wide Web, for

    21           example, seek out specific types of information or URL's or

    22           whatnot.

    23           BY MR. BARON:  

    24           Q   Does Alta Vista employ a Bot?

    25           A   Yes, I don't know if they call it a Bot or a Spider, but

                                                                            39

     1           Alta Vista employs software that allows it to traverse the

     2           Web to find the URL's that exist on the Web so they can store

     3           them in a database so that when you go there to search you

     4           can find what you're looking for.

     5           Q   And you stated in your deposition that you thought there

     6           were about 10 to 20 directories and search engines that are

     7           popularly used today, correct?

     8           A   Yes, it's correct.  For example, if you go to the

     9           Netscape Homepage and go to their Searchpage, Netscape which

    10           is the most popular browser on the Internet for use in the

    11           World Wide Web has a page which provides for its customers

    12           the ability to go search.  And so they have a page with all

    13           the search engines there and all the directories.  And I

    14           think the directory page may list 10 to 15 directories or so

    15           and the search engine page may list another 10 to 15 or so,

    16           so maybe there's 10 to 20, maybe there's 30 and they're

    17           changing all the time.

    18                    There's probably about 250 directories and search

    19           engines all over the Web but I don't think that they're all

    20           equally popular.

    21           Q   Well, you told me at your deposition, didn't you, that

    22           for the 10 or 20 major ones that they're all employing Bots

    23           or some other software to search the Web for URL's to

    24           incorporate in their database, correct?

    25           A   Yes, I told you that and also we have to make an

                                                                            40

     1           important distinction because some of the directories also

     2           employ human beings who will go out and search for

     3           information and then make a determination on whether it

     4           should be included in their directory.  

     5                    And there's a very important distinction between a

     6           search engine and a directory because search engines like

     7           Alta Vista, for example, do not discriminate.  If it's on the

     8           Web and they can find it, it will go in the database.  And

     9           they currently catalogue 22 million unique URL's.  

    10                    So that's considered to be right now our best guess

    11           at the universe of information available on the World Wide

    12           Web.  They also catalogue about 11 billion words and that's

    13           considered to be the universe of information right now on the

    14           World Wide Web.  

    15                    However, a directory, for example, Magellan which is

    16           also referred to as the McKinley Index, these are -- this is

    17           a directory where people have made a choice about what URL's

    18           to include and then they look at the site and then they rate

    19           it using a star system where four stars is the best.

    20                    So on these directories you find a much smaller

    21           universe of URL's from which you can search.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And your testimony is that the best

    23           guess at least at some recent time was that there are 22

    24           million URL's out there or were?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's not a guess, it's just that

                                                                            41

     1           we know that Alta Vista indexes 22 million unique URL's in

     2           its database.  The thing that is interesting is last month

     3           they indexed 21 million, so it's grown by one million unique

     4           URL's in about the last four weeks.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What does a typical directory, how

     6           many do they --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  It -- it depends.  It might be 5,000,

     8           it might be a few hundred, it might be 10,000.  They're

     9           typically smaller, especially if they have to go through and

    10           somebody has to like look at these things and make some

    11           determination about them.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So the difference between the

    13           directory and the search engine is the search engine

    14           encompasses all?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  It could, that could be a difference,

    16           yes.  For like -- yes, for Alta Vista which is a search

    17           engine or Lycos which is a search engine, right, those

    18           encompass all, they do not discriminate.  If it's out there

    19           and the software finds it, it will store it in a database. 

    20                    Yahoo, for example, to use a very prominent

    21           difference, Yahoo is a directory and Yahoo catalogues, Yahoo

    22           has a person, a human being who sits there and she decides

    23           this URL will go in, this URL will not go in.  She also

    24           decides how to catalogue them so the main distinction between

    25           directories and search agents is a directory catalogues or

                                                                            42

     1           otherwise structures the information for you.  

     2                    So like if you go to Yahoo, you can look -- let's

     3           say you're interested in information about sports.  There's a

     4           sports heading and you can click there and there will be all

     5           the links on sports.  And Alta Vista --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Just all the links that Yahoo gives

     7           you?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  All the links that Yahoo has

     9           determined should be included in its directory under the

    10           heading sports, yes.

    11                    There's another well known directory open -- Yahoo,

    12           like for example, I don't know how many URL's Yahoo has, it

    13           has a lot, but as an example, in their company's directory

    14           which is the commercial portion of Yahoo there's over 50,000.

    15                    In -- but if I were to search for companies on Alta

    16           Vista I would get millions, so it would be many more.  Open

    17           Market, another popular directory, lists about 22,000

    18           entries, so it's a little -- it's much smaller than Yahoo but

    19           they go through a more detailed process in order to register

    20           your information.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And Alta Vista is growing at about

    22           one million URL's a month?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, last month it grew one million

    24           URL's.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Because it was cold and people had

                                                                            43

     1           nothing else to do.

     2                    (Laughter.)

     3           BY MR. BARON:  

     4           Q   Well, let me just ask a couple more questions about this

     5           topic of search for hits.  Individuals are also employing

     6           Spiders to go out and traverse the Web looking for

     7           information, correct?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   And the server log on a Web site records that access

    10           having been made to that page, correct?

    11           A   That's correct.

    12           Q   For Spiders and for Bots?

    13           A   The server log records whenever another computer comes to

    14           its Web site so the Spider or this Intelligent Agent or the

    15           software program had to come from somewhere just as if I were

    16           visiting and the server log records that access as a domain

    17           visit, yes.

    18           Q   Even without any real human person looking at that site?

    19           A   Yes, that's true.

    20           Q   And the major directories or search engines, the ten or

    21           twenty you've described or more, go out and search at least

    22           one, once a day and probably much more often, correct?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   And they go back to sites that they've already visited to

    25           see what's new, correct?

                                                                            44

     1           A   Yes, that's correct.

     2           Q   Okay.  There are lots of directories out there in

     3           cyberspace that have URL's, correct?

     4           A   Well, yes, by definition if it's a directory on the Web

     5           it must have a URL.

     6           Q   You said in your deposition that there are hundreds if

     7           not thousands of examples of individuals who have put

     8           together indexes on particular topics of interest to other

     9           individuals in cyberspace, correct?

    10           A   Yes, that's correct.

    11           Q   And one of the ways that directories come into being or

    12           one of the ways that one can communicate in cyberspace is to

    13           fill out forms, correct?

    14           A   Uh --

    15           Q   Why don't you explain to the Court what a form is, a Web

    16           form?

    17           A   A fillout form is a page on someone's Web site which has

    18           the facility to take information from you if you would care

    19           to give it.  So, for example, sort of a classic use of a

    20           fillout form in a commercial context would be to give your

    21           name, demographic information and maybe your credit card

    22           number.  So there would be little spaces there for you to

    23           type in your name, there might even be little sort of virtual

    24           bubbles, if you will, that you could use a mouse to click and

    25           say what gender you were and it would say male, female, maybe

                                                                            45

     1           a little button and you'd click whether you were a male or

     2           female.  Then there would be another box to enter some

     3           information that the firm might like to know about you and

     4           that would be captured through what is called a fillout form.

     5                    And there would be many other uses.  We use them on

     6           the Project 2000 site to get information about people that

     7           visit so we can put them on a mailing list, for example.

     8           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 40?  You mentioned earlier Open

     9           Market?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   Is this -- is Defendant's Exhibit 40 an example of an

    12           Open Market page?

    13           A   Yes, that's an example of an Open Market page.

    14                    Excuse me, could I have more water, please?

    15           Q   Oh, sure.

    16                    (Pause.)

    17           Q   Are you ready?

    18           A   I'm ready.

    19           Q   Professor Hoffman, you stated a few minutes ago in

    20           testimony that Open Market has a, I believe I got this right,

    21           a more detailed process for registering entries in their

    22           directory, correct?

    23           A   Yes, that's correct.

    24           Q   Could you just explain for the Court what Exhibit 40

    25           represents in terms of the commercial sites index listing

                                                                            46

     1           submission?

     2           A   Yes, this is --

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Excuse me, I think counsel misspoke. 

     4           Do you mean to say Exhibit 41?

     5                    MR. BARON:  No, I'm referring to Exhibit 40.

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, all right.  

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which is headed "Open Market's

     8           Commercial Sites Index," correct?

     9                    MR. BARON:  Correct.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  And then it says "Commercial Sites

    11           Index Listing Submission."

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, this is the page if you were to

    14           go to the Open Market homepage or maybe someone told you this

    15           URL directly and you entered it directly.  But in any event

    16           let's just say you found your way to this page deliberately

    17           because you knew it existed and you wanted to register your

    18           commercial site with Open Market.  

    19                    You would have to go to this page, you would follow

    20           the instructions on this page and, even though you can't see

    21           it from this hard copy printing, it's a fillout form where

    22           so, for example, see where it says "New Listing Update Old

    23           Listing," those are choices and you would click on one of

    24           those to indicate to Open Market whether you wanted to update

    25           a listing you already had in their directory or you wanted to

                                                                            47

     1           enter a new listing.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why do you say you can't see it? 

     3           Isn't it on the next page?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  No, I mean you can't tell from this

     5           hard copy printout --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, it's on this and the next page.

     7                    THE WITNESS:   -- what it would really look like on

     8           the World Wide Web on a computer because it would be

     9           highlighted and it would be obvious that you would have, you

    10           know, there would be an action required on your part which

    11           would be to click.

    12                    Then if you saw where it says "Listing name," that

    13           would be a text box.  It hasn't come out here on the print,

    14           on the printer, but there would be a -- that would be the

    15           place where it would be obvious for you to type the name that

    16           you wanted the listing to appear as in the directory, and so

    17           on.

    18                    And so you would go through this process on line,

    19           filling out this fillout form, it would be stored directly in

    20           their database, they might do some processing of it and then

    21           they would -- I do not know if Open Market screens these or

    22           makes some determination on what's appropriate or not.  I do

    23           know that they have 22,000 or so listings and since that's

    24           half the size of Yahoo's listings, I infer there may be some

    25           sort of selection process involved or either that or not

                                                                            48

     1           everybody wants to list with Open Market.

     2           BY MR. BARON:  

     3           Q   And when someone wants to list with Open Market, then

     4           individuals in cyberspace can search against the Open Market

     5           directory of the sites that are listed?

     6           A   Yes, that's correct.

     7           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 41?

     8           A   Yes, I see it.

     9           Q   Do you recall my showing you this page at your

    10           deposition?

    11           A   Yes, I do.

    12           Q   Could you explain for the Court what this page

    13           represents?

    14           A   Yes.  This is -- this appears to represent someone typing

    15           in on a previous page which asked you to search which gives

    16           people the opportunity to search for particular listings in

    17           the Open Market directory.  Someone has performed a search of

    18           listings that contain the word p-o-r-n or porn.  And the

    19           search appears to have returned 23 items.

    20                    Now, I'm going to assume that because they're from A

    21           to Z that that's an exhaustive list of the sites on Open

    22           Market out of the 22,000 or so sites that contain the word

    23           porn and that's 23 items.

    24           Q   And could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 42?         

    25           A   Yes, I see that.

                                                                            49

     1           Q   What would this represent, this page?

     2           A   Well, this appears to represent what would happen if the

     3           person who had searched for porn clicked on the first entry

     4           which was Triple A Adult Entertainment, then that would take

     5           you directly to a page, it appears to be still on the Open

     6           Market site which then gives you more information about the

     7           Triple A Adult Entertainment commercial site and then

     8           there's, that's obvious from underlining that that's a

     9           Hypertext link, so if you then chose to go to the Triple A

    10           Entertainment, Adult Entertainment site, you would click on

    11           that link and then you would be what we call off site, you

    12           would now be somewhere else in cyberspace.

    13           Q   But the point here is that the Triple A Adult

    14           Entertainment site has essentially gone through a

    15           registration process with the Open Market directory, correct?

    16           A   Yes, they have listed their business with the Open Market

    17           commercial directory.

    18           Q   All right, thank you.  Let me turn to a separate subject. 

    19           Is it -- is it your testimony, as you state in your

    20           deposition, that there are approximately 12 to 15 million

    21           subscribers to AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy?

    22           A   Yes, and all of the commercial on-line services, not just

    23           the top three, because Microsoft Network is rapidly

    24           approaching one million subscribers by itself.

    25           Q   You agree, do you not, that it is in the interest of the

                                                                            50

     1           marketplace to adopt parental controls?

     2           A   Yes, I do.

     3           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 48 which I believe would be in

     4           the second volume?

     5                    (Pause; discussion off the record.)

     6           BY MR. BARON:  

     7           Q   Do you recall my showing you this exhibit in your

     8           deposition?

     9           A   Yes, I do.

    10           Q   Could you generally describe for the Court what it

    11           represents in terms of a Web page? 

    12           A   Yes, it's an advertisement for an adult bulletin board.

    13           Q   It appears to state that one calls a 900 number to get a

    14           user name and a password and there will be a $20 charge on a

    15           phone bill and then after you call that number --

    16           A   Oh, right, yes, I'm sorry.  This is the other one you

    17           showed me.  This is not an advertisement for an adult

    18           bulletin board, this is a -- the homepage of a commercial Web

    19           site that contains sexually explicit material and this is the

    20           process by which they register you.  You must, rather than

    21           using a fillout form, you go off line with a telephone number

    22           and give your credit card information.

    23           Q   Could you read for the Court in the small  print what it

    24           says, starting with the word "due"?

    25           A   "Due to the passage of the Telecommunication Act of

                                                                            51

     1           1995," -- which is wrong -- "which includes provisions

     2           banning indecent material on the Internet, the material here

     3           has been temporarily removed while we bring it into

     4           compliance.  The member area is not affected."

     5           Q   Do you have any idea what might have been on the site

     6           prior to the words here?

     7           A   No, I have no idea.

     8           Q   Okay. It would have been a pornographic image?

     9           A   It could have been a --

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Objection, she says she has no idea.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sustained.

    12           BY MR. BARON:  

    13           Q   Okay.  Would you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 49?

    14                    You stated at your deposition on Monday that you

    15           were generally familiar with a site called Bianca's Smut

    16           Shack, correct?

    17           A   Yes, correct.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Bianca's what?

    19                    MR. BARON:  Smut Shack, S-m-u-t.

    20           BY MR. BARON:  

    21           Q   You would, turning from the material beyond the first

    22           page, you would agree, would you not, that the text of the

    23           materials on this site are sexually explicit?

    24           A   You mean in general?

    25           Q   The text of the various pages at the end of this exhibit,

                                                                            52

     1           correct?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   Okay.  Now, just concentrating on the first page of the

     4           exhibit, you see where it's titled "The Rules of the Game?"

     5           A   Yes, I see that.

     6           Q   Would you read for the Court in the third paragraph, can

     7           you read to the Court what the third paragraph states?

     8           A   The paragraph starting second?

     9           Q   Yes.

    10           A   "Second, Bianca Trol Productions recognizes its

    11           responsibility under current U.S. law to take, 'in good

    12           faith, reasonable, effective and appropriate actions under

    13           the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors

    14           to,' this site which may contain adult language and

    15           situations.  We are also taking, 'appropriate measures to

    16           restrict minors from such communications, including any

    17           method which is feasible under available technology.'"

    18           Q   Could you look at Point 2 which follows where it's

    19           described as Technology Measure No. 1, and could you, after

    20           you've had a moment to look at it, inform the Court what

    21           Bianca is stating here?

    22           A   Well, the site is stating that there is a way to block

    23           people from coming to the site by means of blocking the IP

    24           addresses which represent this particular site, so that you

    25           can block at the user site by saying the -- by not allowing

                                                                            53

     1           the browser to go to sites that have particular IP or

     2           Internet protocol addresses which are those numerical

     3           addresses you see there, the 204.62.13.6, that's the locate--

     4           that's the address of this particular site in cyberspace and

     5           there's another address associated with it.  And if I know

     6           the address, I can block it so that my particular computer

     7           could not go to that address.

     8           Q   You would agree, would you not, that Technology Measure

     9           No. 2 is an effective measure with respect to blocking

    10           individuals who access that ISP?

    11           A   It's -- I agree that it's an effective measure of

    12           blocking particular computers or people's access who use

    13           those computers to particular sites, yes.

    14           Q   Would you look at Technology Measure No. 2 which is

    15           listed at Point 3?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And inform the Court what the site is instructing to do?

    18           A   Well, you can also do the reverse.  If you give your IP

    19           address, if I were to send my -- my address to this

    20           particular site, then it would also block me that way.  So I

    21           would -- I could go there but it wouldn't let me in because

    22           then it would know that I was coming in and say uh-oh, you

    23           know, Professor Hoffman not allowed at this site, as

    24           identified by my IP address on my computer.

    25           Q   All right, thank you.  Your testimony and your

                                                                            54

     1           declaration-- that will be the end of the use of that -- your

     2           testimony in your declaration is that the act in question

     3           here, the Communications Decency Act, will have negative

     4           consequences for the new medium of the Internet and

     5           specifically the World Wide Web, correct?

     6           A   Correct.

     7           Q   You will -- you concede, will you not or you do concede,

     8           do you not, that the exhibit that was 48 which was the

     9           Cybersex City exhibit with the 1-900 number?

    10           A   Mm-hmm.

    11           Q   The fact that the material that's been removed with that

    12           disclaimer about the Telecommunications Act, whatever that

    13           material was, you would concede would you not that the

    14           removal of that material does not have a profound adverse

    15           consequence in terms of the growth of the Internet or the

    16           ease of use of the World Wide Web, correct?

    17           A   In that particular instance on that particular site I

    18           would concede that, yes.

    19           Q   You would also concede, would you not, Professor Hoffman,

    20           that the site that's Bianca's Smut Shack's decision to

    21           include a rules of the game homepage complete with tagging

    22           and registration requirements as set forth in those two

    23           technology measures will similarly not have a profound

    24           adverse effect on the growth of the Web or the ease of use of

    25           the Internet, correct?

                                                                            55

     1           A   On that particular site, that's correct.

     2           Q   Could you explain for the Court what Anonymous Remailers

     3           are?

     4           A   Yes, Anonymous Remailers and their -- and a related

     5           service called Pseudonymity Servers are computer services

     6           that privatize your identity in cyberspace.  They allow

     7           individuals to, for example, post content for example to a

     8           Usenet News group or to send an E-mail without knowing the

     9           individual's true identity.

    10                    The difference between an Anonymous Remailer and a

    11           Pseudonymity Server is very important because an Anonymous

    12           Remailer provides what we might consider to be true anonymity

    13           to the individual because there would be no way to know on

    14           separate instances who the person was who was making the post

    15           or sending the E-mail.

    16                    But with a Pseudonymity Server, an individual can

    17           have what we consider to be a persistent presence in

    18           cyberspace, so you can have a pseudonym attached to your

    19           postings or your E-mails, but your true identity is not

    20           revealed.  And these mechanisms allow people to communicate

    21           in cyberspace without revealing their true identities.

    22           Q   I just have one question, Professor Hoffman, on this

    23           topic.  You have not done any study or survey to sample the

    24           quantity or the amount of anonymous remailing on the

    25           Internet, correct?

                                                                            56

     1           A   That's correct.  I think by definition it's a very

     2           difficult problem to study because these are people who wish

     3           to remain anonymous and the people who provide these services

     4           wish to remain anonymous.

     5           Q   You would agree, Professor Hoffman, that the Alt Binary's

     6           hierarchy of Usenet News groups contains pornographic

     7           imagery, correct?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Objection, I'm not sure the word

     9           "pornographic" has any meaning in the legal meaning.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, does it to you?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  I agree it contains sexually explicit

    12           material, yes.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, overruled.

    14           BY MR. BARON:  

    15           Q   You also agree, do you not, that pornographers are using

    16           Usenet News groups to advertise, correct?

    17           A   Yes.  But can I clarify that?

    18           Q   Sure.

    19           A   What I have seen on Usenet News groups is that operators

    20           of adult bulletin boards are in some cases, although it's

    21           sometimes difficult to tell because it could just as well be

    22           individuals who have downloaded content and are re-posting it

    23           on Usenet News, but there are cases of images from adult

    24           bulletin boards which are re-posted on Usenet News groups and

    25           there's some idea that the operators of the adult bulletin

                                                                            57

     1           boards are using this as a mechanism to advertise their

     2           service.

     3           Q   Now, we've already gone over Paragraph 122 of your

     4           declaration where you said that it is your, quote,

     5           "impression," unquote, that there is a decreasing percentage

     6           of sexually specific material in cyberspace as a proportion

     7           of the total amount of packet traffic or hosts or however one

     8           counts the Internet in terms of how big it is, correct?

     9           A   Well, I didn't, no, that's not correct.  My declaration

    10           doesn't say that.  It says that it is my opinion based on my

    11           experience and my research in this medium that when

    12           considered as a percent of the total information, so I'm

    13           thinking of it particularly in terms either of postings for

    14           example on Usenet News groups or in terms of URL's, for

    15           example, on that portion of the Internet known as the World

    16           Wide Web that the amount of sexually explicit material

    17           available is actually constant and so as a percent of total

    18           is decreasing because the total amount of information on the

    19           Internet is increasing at a very rapid rate.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So it's that deduction is behind

    21           Paragraph 122?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's correct.

    23           BY MR. BARON:  

    24           Q   But you can't say, can you, Professor Hoffman, in terms

    25           of packet traffic on the Internet whether the sexually

                                                                            58

     1           explicit material consists of 10,000 packets or a million

     2           packets or a billion packets, correct?

     3           A   No, I can't say that, no one can say that.

     4           Q   You have given no absolute number in terms of what the

     5           quantum of pornography or sexually explicit material is in

     6           cyberspace, correct?

     7           A   Correct.

     8           Q   Could you turn to Paragraph 129 of your declaration?

     9                    You state that digital Alta Vista's search engine

    10           currently indexes over 21 million unique URL's and 10 billion

    11           words on the World Wide Web?

    12           A   Correct, except now it's -- I just checked yesterday,

    13           it's now 22 million unique URL's and 11 million words -- 11

    14           billion words, I'm sorry.

    15           Q   All right.  Now, as a hypothetical if just one percent of

    16           cyberspace on the Web contains sexually explicit material,

    17           that would translate, under your new numbers, as 220,000

    18           unique URL's and 110 million words by your calculation,

    19           correct?  It's one percent of these figures.

    20           A   If you assumed it was distributed uniformly that would be

    21           a correct mathematical calculation, yes.

    22           Q   Would you consider that to be a large amount under that

    23           hypothetical?

    24           A   I would not consider it to be a large amount as percent

    25           of total.  I think it's very difficult to make absolute

                                                                            59

     1           statements about numbers unless they are referenced in a

     2           framework.

     3           Q   Well, you've testified that the Web is growing

     4           phenomenally, right?

     5           A   The Web as measured in the number of servers is growing,

     6           is doubling approximately every two and a half months.  The

     7           Internet as measured in the number of hosts computers

     8           connected to it is doubling annually and has been so since

     9           about 1981 or 1982.  So that we consider these to be

    10           exponential and phenomenal rates of growth, yes.

    11           Q   Well, given that phenomenal growth, just to be clear

    12           about what your declaration is saying, a number can grow in

    13           absolute numerical terms but still represent a smaller

    14           percentage of a larger total if that total is growing

    15           phenomenally, correct?

    16           A   I don't understand what you just said. 

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You can make that argument.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think we understand the basic laws

    19           of mathematics.

    20                    MR. BARON:  All right, I have no more questions,

    21           your Honors.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, this is a good time to take

    23           the ten-minute break and it will be a ten-minute break.

    24                    THE COURT CLERK:  All right, please.

    25                    (Court in recess; 10:45 to 11:00 o'clock a.m.)

                                                                            60

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, we'll hear the plaintiffs on

     2           redirect.

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.

     4                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     5           BY MR. HANSEN:  

     6           Q   Professor Hoffman, you had some discussion with the

     7           Government concerning the definition of hits and unique

     8           domains of methods of measuring the number of people who are

     9           actually traveling in cyberspace.  Does the -- would you

    10           explain again what a unique domain is?

    11           A   Yes.  A unique domain is, very simply stated, the address

    12           of the computer.  Every computer has associated with it a

    13           particular address and that address can be in words, so, for

    14           example, gateway.senate.gov, or it can be in numbers, the

    15           numerical address or sometimes called the IP address, which

    16           stands for Internet protocol.  However, the situation becomes

    17           a little bit more confusing or complicated, because there are

    18           various types of systems that computers can be assigned

    19           addresses, which makes it very difficult to know what --

    20           which particular computer might be coming to your site.  So,

    21           for example the -- let's just take an example of AOL, the

    22           commercial on-line service which is a gateway to the

    23           Internet, the address for AOL is aol.com, that's a domain

    24           name, and it has an IP address associated with it, which I

    25           don't know what that is.  However, AOL has a series of

                                                                            61

     1           machines that it uses for its users to get onto the Internet

     2           and they might be called, for example, aol1.aol.com,

     3           aol2.aol.com, and so on.  But AOL has about five million

     4           users, but AOL does not have five million unique domains, it

     5           only has a much smaller number.  So, for example, on the

     6           Project 2000 site we get many visits from AOL presumably, but

     7           they only -- from people who use AOL as their gateway to surf

     8           the net, but it shows up in our server log as, say,

     9           aol1.aol.com and that's a hit, a visit.  What I don't know is

    10           how many people were associated with that domain, because

    11           when I count -- when I have a program that runs and goes

    12           through the server log and counts up how many times

    13           AOL1.AOL.com came I have no idea who it was behind that

    14           machine or how many.  So, it could have been a child, it

    15           could have been an adult, it could have been the same adult

    16           on repeated occasions, because there might be ten listings in

    17           the server log that say aol1.aol.com coming in, say, at 10:00

    18           a.m., and then maybe at noon aol1.aol.com came in again, and

    19           then at 4:00 p.m. in the log it might show aol1.aol.com

    20           again, but I would have no way of knowing who it was or how 

    21           -- or anything.

    22           Q   So, when you try to determine the number of unique

    23           domains that have visited your Web site would that

    24           underestimate or overestimate the number of actual people who

    25           have come and looked at your Web site?

                                                                            62

     1           A   Well, it's clearly a lower bound, because what it really

     2           estimates is the number of unique computers that came to the

     3           site, it does not give anything but a lower bound on how many

     4           -- on the minimum number of people who could have come.  And

     5           in fact that's one of the impetuses for our research on

     6           counting the number of users, because up until the time that

     7           we started our research on Internet measurement people were

     8           trying to estimate the number of computer users worldwide by

     9           counting the number of machines connected to the Internet and

    10           multiplying by a number.  So, for example, the rule of thumb

    11           factor or the number was some number between five and ten,

    12           because the conventional wisdom was many years ago or even

    13           five years ago that there were about five to ten people

    14           associated with each computer domain, but over time that's

    15           clearly become untrue because -- for a number of reasons;

    16           one, because of hosts like AOL, which have five million users

    17           but only a very small and finite number of domains; hosts

    18           like Compuserve, compuserve.com, for example; and through a

    19           procedure called, for example, dynamic allocations, so at

    20           Universities and other businesses IP addresses are assigned

    21           dynamically on the moment you log in and those numbers can

    22           change and are not necessarily the same number associated

    23           with the same computer --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  When you say dynamically, a word you

    25           use fairly frequently in your declaration, what do you mean?

                                                                            63

     1                    THE WITNESS:  I mean at that moment, in real time,

     2           so, in response to something happening in the environment. 

     3           In this context of dynamic allocation of IP addresses, that

     4           means at the moment that someone needs to connect to the

     5           Internet from, say, a computer in a computer lab at a

     6           university that computer is assigned a free domain name and

     7           IP address at that moment --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  On the spot?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  -- on the spot, right.  So, dynamic

    10           means in real time something is happening.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And does the number come back, is

    12           it used and then never used again?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  No, it could be used again, but it

    14           might be by another machine in the lab on another day,

    15           another time, another moment, whatever.  So, the best you can

    16           do if you're trying to count -- and the reason obviously I'm

    17           interested in this is from a commercial perspective.  So,

    18           it's very important to get as good a count as possible of the

    19           people in front of the machines, not the machines.  And, so,

    20           we have tried to move away or make arguments that we must

    21           move away from counts of host and then multiplying by a

    22           factor of five or ten, which is now meaningless because some

    23           hosts are single-user hosts.  In other words, my machine,

    24           collette.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu just has me on it, so that's

    25           called a single-host machine or a single-user machine, but

                                                                            64

     1           other hosts, as I've already said, have thousands of people

     2           associated with them.  So, what we have to do is count the

     3           users.  So, the only way to know how many people are coming

     4           to your site and, particularly because of other problems like

     5           the spiders and Bots that go out searching and hit the site

     6           and count as hits, the only way to know is to count the

     7           people on the other side.

     8           BY MR. HANSEN:  

     9           Q   And if we took your computer and ran the number of hits

    10           that your computer received on a particular day, and then

    11           also ran the number of unique domains that had been to your

    12           site on a particular day, the number of actual human beings

    13           would likely be somewhere between those two numbers?

    14           A   Right, but in my particular case, on our server, much

    15           closer to the number of unique domains and that's because we

    16           do not serve, you know, tens of thousands of pages, we're a

    17           research center site and we put up our research papers and we

    18           have thousands of pages.  But a site like Pathfinder, for

    19           example, Time Warner's site, which consists of many of its

    20           on-line magazines and lots of content, they report that they

    21           get like two million hits a week.  So that's clearly a

    22           meaningless number from a commercial perspective, because all

    23           it says is that many files and pictures and images are being

    24           served up, but says very little about who is coming, how many

    25           are coming, how often they're coming and to which pages

                                                                            65

     1           they're coming.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how long they're on?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  And -- exactly.  Duration, we believe,

     4           is one of the critical variables for measuring the value of a

     5           visit to a Web site in this environment and that hits are

     6           meaningless, unique domains are a lower bound, but nothing

     7           else and just useful as a starting point, and that the key

     8           issues are visits and behavior in a network navigation

     9           context, which includes duration in the Web site.

    10           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    11           Q   Professor Hoffman, are hits meaningless in this context: 

    12           If you are at your Web site in Vanderbilt required to screen

    13           every person who comes to your site and, indeed, every one of

    14           the thousands -- each time anyone goes to any one of the

    15           thousands of pages on your site and determine whether that

    16           person is above the age of 18 or under the age of 18, is hits

    17           a meaningless number in that context?

    18           A   Completely meaningless.  Hits, even unique domains are

    19           just completely meaningless, there is no way to determine

    20           from the server log file, which contains information on the

    21           hits and the unique domains, who is coming to my Web site.

    22           Q   But you would nevertheless have to screen the -- the

    23           number of times you would have to check to see if someone is

    24           18 or not 18 would be roughly measured by the number of hits,

    25           the number of actual times you would have to look and see is

                                                                            66

     1           that person 18 or not?

     2           A   Yes, roughly speaking, by some -- divided by some factor

     3           for how many hits were on a particular page, but, yes, if I -

     4           - let's just say I have a thousand pages, for sake of

     5           argument, on the Project 2000 site, every single one of those

     6           pages of those 1,000 pages would have to have some sort of

     7           screening device, otherwise I would not be able to prevent

     8           them from coming to those pages or determining who was coming

     9           to those pages.

    10           Q   When you run the unique domain list of the number of

    11           unique domains that have come to your site on a particular

    12           day does it also show the country from which someone has come

    13           to access your site?

    14           A   Well, it could, it's -- it could in the sense that unique

    15           domains have identifiers associated with them.  To understand

    16           this idea we can introduce the notion of what we'll call the

    17           top-level domain.  So, again, to use my example,

    18           collette.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu, that's my entire address or

    19           host name or domain name, the top level is edu and that

    20           identifies my machine as coming from an educational

    21           institution, because it has the .edu address.  Now, the most

    22           common addresses in cyberspace are the .com for commercial,

    23           that's the top level. So, aol.com or timewarner.com or

    24           openmarket.com and so on.  Edu is the second most common,

    25           followed by .net, which represent Internet service providers

                                                                            67

     1           and other gateways to the Internet.  There's .org for

     2           nonprofit organizations, .gov, for government organizations. 

     3           So, the domain name here almost certainly has a .gov at the

     4           end of it, and so on.  So, it is -- and then there are many

     5           other domain names, like .ca at the top would represent

     6           Canada, .es would represent Estonia and so on.  So, in theory

     7           it is possible to run a program and count, using a table for

     8           lookup, say, which would say, well, I know how many came from

     9           Spain, I know how many came from Finland, I know how many

    10           came from the Netherlands and so on, because in the

    11           Netherlands they usually use a .nl as the top-level domain. 

    12           So, you can get -- but that only gives you an underestimate,

    13           because increasingly the .com address is being used abroad

    14           and that didn't used to be the case, but is now increasingly

    15           the case, and the .com host is about 26 percent of all hosts

    16           on the Internet.  So, right now the Internet has -- it was

    17           just recently measured in January, it's measured every six

    18           months by Mark Lottor, and his latest measurements show that

    19           the Internet has 9.47 million hosts, about, give or take.  Of

    20           those nine and a half million, let's round it for ease of

    21           discussion, about 26 percent are .com, about 19 percent are

    22           .edu, and we know that -- so that the .coms represent not

    23           just U.S. commercial enterprise, but also overseas commercial

    24           enterprise.

    25           Q   And using this system --

                                                                            68

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me, what percentage are .org?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  I think it's about three percent, a

     3           little less than three percent.  The .net, .org and .gov are

     4           all running a little below three percent.  If we look at a

     5           host distribution by country, though, that was in -- the

     6           latest measurements for that were taken in July of 1995.  So,

     7           we don't have the figures for Mr. Lottor's most recent

     8           calculations, because they haven't been done yet; however,

     9           those distributions show that 60 percent of hosts were

    10           thought to originate from the United States and 40 percent of

    11           those hosts, and in July, '95 the hosts were running a little

    12           over six and a half million, now it's almost ten million, so

    13           it was about 60-40 U.S., non-U.S., and the distribution -- I

    14           don't remember exactly, it was United States followed by --

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And the source you're citing is

    16           what?

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Lottor.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Lottor?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Lottor, L-o-t-t-o-r, Mark Lottor, he

    20           runs a company called Network Wizards and as a service to the

    21           Internet community he runs a program which counts the number

    22           of hosts on the computer every six months.  I don't -- I

    23           cannot find my... oh, here it is, I found it.  My listing is

    24           United States had a little over 60 percent, followed by

    25           Germany, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, the

                                                                            69

     1           Netherlands, France, Finland and Sweden, and those are the

     2           top ten.  Now, the distribution now is thought to be 60-40,

     3           even though we don't know yet, but we believe it's moving

     4           towards 60-40 and it was at 64-36.  So, it's clearly moving

     5           toward parody and that seems -- is also borne out by counting

     6           the number of networks connected to the Internet, which is

     7           now moving toward a parody distribution of about 50-50,

     8           meaning about 50 percent of networks connected to the net are

     9           in the U.S. and about 50 percent of networks connected to the

    10           Internet are non-U.S.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that also Mr. Lottor's work?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  That is also Mr. Lottor's work, with

    13           also John Quarterman, who provided some of these statistics

    14           based on reanalyses of Mr. Lottor's data.

    15           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    16           Q   Professor Hoffman, you were present in court yesterday

    17           when Ms. Duvall did her demonstration?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   And you saw her take us all to a site that was in London,

    20           is that correct?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   Is it fair to say that it takes just as many clicks to go

    23           a site in London as it does to go to a site in Philadelphia?

    24           A   Yes, or just as few, as the case may be.

    25           Q   Now, I'd like you to -- I'd like to refer you back to

                                                                            70

     1           Defendant's Exhibit 13-A, which was the Little Women search. 

     2                    (Pause.)

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Now, the particular entry on that page that you were

     5           questioned about, the see-hot-pictures-of-naked-women page,

     6           do you know whether that particular site if I clicked on it

     7           would be blocked by Surf Watch?

     8           A   I don't know.

     9           Q   Let's look at Defendant's Exhibit 49, which was the --

    10           which was Bianca's site which you were questioned about.

    11                    (Pause.)

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   Now, Mr. Baron asked you to read Technology Measures 1

    14           and 2, he didn't ask you to read Technology Measure 3, would

    15           you read that?  It's Number 4, but Technology Measure 3,

    16           would you read that one, please?

    17           A   Yes, Technology Measure Number 3:  "We heartily support

    18           all self-imposed Internet content selection solutions, such

    19           as Surf Watch and PICS."

    20           Q   Now, the three technology solutions that are suggested on

    21           this site, do they have anything in common?

    22           A   Yes, they're all user-oriented solutions, because their

    23           activity and control all would reside in the hands of the

    24           user or the people who are accessing the content or

    25           interested in accessing the content.

                                                                            71

     1           Q   Does this site suggest any method by which the content

     2           provider could insure that no one under the age of 18 was

     3           visiting their site?

     4           A   No, and I believe that's because no such solutions are

     5           possible.  And in fact I think it's instructive that they are

     6           requiring you to tell them when you don't wish to be able to

     7           go there, because that's the only way that they can know is

     8           if you tell them.

     9           Q   Thank you.

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, given the objection that

    11           was raised at the beginning of this, I just want to make sure

    12           that her declaration went in as her direct testimony?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Absolutely.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think so --

    15                    MR. HANSEN:  Okay, thank you.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- if it didn't, it does now.

    17                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you have any --

    19                    MR. BARON:  Subject to our objection, your Honor.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Pardon?

    21                    MR. BARON:  Subject to our objection on the

    22           paragraph.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do you have any recross?

                                                                            72

     1                    MR. BARON:  No, your Honor.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Judge Buckwalter?

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I just have a very few questions. 

     4           Throughout your -- well, not throughout your declaration, but

     5           in your declaration, as well as others, there's reference to

     6           the Internet as being a truly democratic information flow and

     7           I think you say in 24 a democratic form of communication,

     8           what do you mean by that when you say that?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  I mean that the Internet, particularly

    10           as compared to traditional communication media and even some

    11           other forms of new media, like other interactive media, is

    12           truly a revolution in the sense that for the first time in

    13           the history of communication media users or individuals can

    14           provide content to the medium.  So, in addition to accessing

    15           information or content they can also provide information to

    16           the medium.  And the other unique feature is coupled with

    17           this idea of interactivity, so that not only can you and I

    18           communicate with each other through the medium, something we

    19           call person interaction, but I can communicate directly with

    20           the medium, something we call machine interactivity, and

    21           that's the idea where I can both access content and provide

    22           it.  So, for the first time there is an opportunity for all

    23           people or any person who has access to the medium to put

    24           their opinion on the medium or in essence to have a voice in

    25           society as represented by the Internet.

                                                                            73

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Without any government

     2           interference, does that --

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Without any --

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- have something to do with your

     5           the -- the --

     6                    THE WITNESS:  No, not really.  No, I meant it in the

     7           sense that there was no -- no, I meant it more that the

     8           medium does not discriminate on the basis of the individual's

     9           either accessing or providing the content.  So, for example,

    10           if I put a site up, which I did, the Project 2000 site, my

    11           site has just as much chance or is just as likely to be

    12           visited by people as a site by a communications conglomerate

    13           like Time Warner, because there is nothing inherent in the

    14           medium keeping someone from coming to Project 2000, there are

    15           no barriers, there are no gateways, they don't have to pay to

    16           get there --

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But there is a -- there is a Big

    18           Brother overlooking the media -- or overlooking the Internet

    19           in a sense, isn't there?  If it's not the government it's the

    20           people who for example have the -- in these directories

    21           you're talking about who make choices as to what goes in the

    22           directory?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't look at that -- I don't

    24           think of that as Big Brother --

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, no, I mean maybe not as Big

                                                                            74

     1           Brother, but there's somebody out there.  And on the on-line

     2           discussion forums, for example, isn't there somebody who

     3           steers the discussion in some way?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  No, not necessarily.  On UseNet news

     5           groups, there are two types of UseNet news groups, if that's

     6           what you're referring to?

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, I mean --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  And those -- there are moderated --

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- on some discussion forums

    10           isn't there somebody who steers and focuses the discussion?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it depends what you mean by --

    12           no, I am not aware of anyone --

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  It's not an open --

    14                    THE WITNESS:  -- on un-moderated discussion lists

    15           like UseNet news groups, for example, who steers or focuses

    16           the discussion.  The people themselves determine the content

    17           and the focus and the positioning of the discussion, but

    18           there is no person on the shoulder of the UseNet news group

    19           if it's un-moderated saying now we will talk about X and

    20           tomorrow we will talk about Y.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I only raise that question

    22           because I was surfing or browsing magazines, which is what we

    23           used to do --

    24                    (Laughter.)

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- and The Atlantic magazine, in

                                                                            75

     1           this month's article -- that's on something called paper --

     2                    (Laughter.)

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- raised this, suggesting that

     4           the most popular on-line discussion forums tend to be not

     5           purely democratic by quasi-authoritarian in spirit, with an

     6           active systems operator who both steers and stimulates

     7           debate.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Maybe you put on the record --

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  On the record, that's --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- where you're --

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- the -- that's attributed to

    12           James Fowell (ph.), the Washington editor of The Atlantic

    13           magazine and it's their April issue.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And his position was that for the

    16           time being that the editors and other data winnowers are

    17           becoming important in this whole scheme of things, because

    18           they do actually overlook the system in some way and --

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there is no question that there

    20           are a number of gatekeepers, if you want to think of it from

    21           that perspective.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Gatekeepers, okay.  Well, that's

    23           the terminology, I --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  However, they are definitely not, at

    25           least from my perspective -- or have a Big Brother component

                                                                            76

     1           to them.  And particularly on the UseNet news groups, just to

     2           use that example, it really -- if they're not moderated

     3           people are free to say and post and do what they like, if

     4           other people don't like it then they will respond by saying,

     5           I don't like that, a process we sometimes refer to as

     6           flaming.  But the whole behavior on the group is very organic

     7           with no one necessarily determining now we will do this and

     8           then we will do that.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What does organic mean in that

    10           context?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it flows -- it evolves

    12           naturally, there is no one in charge of the process, it is

    13           allowed to grow and flow naturally as events unfold.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Like a conversation at a cocktail

    15           party.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Exactly.  Now, there are 

    17           gatekeepers --

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But it's not that exactly though,

    19           is it?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I think it's more like that --

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, okay, we won't debate that.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  -- than like the way that you

    23           proposed, because the Internet is composed of -- for example,

    24           on UseNet news there are approximately 15,000 UseNet news

    25           groups and, by and large, I would say that the behavior is

                                                                            77

     1           very open and democratic with access to all, you can say what

     2           you like, other people can respond in kind or not, you are

     3           not required to respond, and really there is no one in charge

     4           in a broader sense.  The same is true on the Web, there are

     5           many indexes, there are not just one index and that's it and

     6           that's the only one you can list in and if you don't list

     7           there, forget it, you're no one.

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand the point you're

     9           trying to make.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Did you have any more questions?

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I think that's all then.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I have a number of questions.  First

    14           of all, these -- this hierarchy you referred to, the point

    15           that .com means commercial, that .edu means education, these

    16           are self-given names?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  No, they are -- there is a

    18           registration process that you have to go through for

    19           addresses --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I thought.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  -- through an organization called

    22           Internick (ph.) and domains have to be registered so that

    23           they can be connected to the Internet.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And also so that they're not

    25           duplicated?

                                                                            78

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's the most important point,

     2           so that you have a unique identifier in cyberspace for your

     3           host computer to be connected to the Internet.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And so Internick, somebody at

     5           Internick makes a judgment, correct?  For example, if my

     6           daughter wanted to register and say I'm an edu somebody there

     7           would say that's ridiculous, you're just a kid?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, there are specific rules for --

     9           which are fairly broadly defined, but rules nonetheless

    10           governing the use of the top-level domains, particular for

    11           .com, .edu, .net, .org and .gov.  I think there are other

    12           organizations besides Internick that register and the rules

    13           are different, particularly for some of the European or

    14           overseas addresses, because it could also be the case that it

    15           might say .es, which stands for Estonia, but it's not

    16           necessarily the case that those hosts originate in Estonia. 

    17           So, it's very complicated.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Referring now to your

    19           declaration, in Paragraph 31, Footnote 1 there has a number

    20           of statistics and the footnote begins by saying, "The most

    21           recent figures, decisionmakers are using for business

    22           planning and research purposes," do you see that?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And then it makes reference to the

    25           "so-called total core economy for electronic commerce on the

                                                                            79

     1           Internet will approach $45.8 billion by the year 2000," et

     2           cetera.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm, yes.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Where do those numbers come from?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  The first source -- these all come

     6           from analysts --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Pardon me?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Analysts.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, Wall Street analysts?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Or research analysts who specialize in

    13           the Internet.  I put them here just to -- first of all to

    14           show the enormous range in the estimates, from very small to

    15           very large, I think by and large reflecting that we really

    16           don't know what's going to happen in the long run.  The first

    17           estimate comes from Forrester Research, the second estimate I

    18           believe comes from Alex Brown and Sons, and then the third

    19           one comes from Hamberg & Quist (ph.), and these are different

    20           analysts who are involved in assessing the business

    21           opportunity for the Internet.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Who are advising -- for the purposes

    23           of advising investors on where to put their money?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  As one example, yes.  In the case of

    25           Forrester Research no, they do -- their clients, they do

                                                                            80

     1           research for their clients on, say, strategic opportunities

     2           on the Internet, in which case it's still important to know

     3           from an investment perspective, say if I wish to open up a

     4           commercial enterprise on line, you know, what -- you know,

     5           how much money could I make, for example.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Page 10, Paragraph 40, just

     7           so I'm absolutely sure I understand what you're saying here,

     8           when you say, and now I'm quoting, "because network

     9           navigation is nonlinear," when you use the word nonlinear

    10           there what exactly do you mean?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Exactly what I mean is that the

    12           navigation process is not strict ordered and sequential.  So,

    13           for example, it's not a rough linear menu, meaning things

    14           fall in a line in order, first one, then you must go to two,

    15           then you must go to three, then you must go to four, as if

    16           they were literally ordered on a line and I had to proceed in

    17           that fashion.  The network navigation experience on the

    18           Worldwide Web is nonlinear in the sense that either I might

    19           be presented with a set of choices on a Web page which are a

    20           list, but I can go anywhere on the list I want, I don't have

    21           to go in order, or, as increasingly is the case, they might

    22           be presented to me graphically in means of different images

    23           or maps or pictures, and I simply move my mouse and point to

    24           the particular area on the map on which I want to go and then

    25           I'm off.

                                                                            81

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, that's very helpful,

     2           thank you.  You also say on Page 21 in Paragraph 93, you make

     3           what seems to me to be an extraordinary statement and I just

     4           want to draw you out on it a little bit.  You referred to the

     5           -- I assume the Internet and the capacity for many-to-many

     6           decentralized communication at --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, would you repeat the

     8           paragraph, please?

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  93.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You refer to it as, quote, "the most

    12           important innovation to human society since the development

    13           of the printing press," close-quote.  Now, that's a pretty

    14           extravagant statement, wouldn't you agree?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  I do -- yes, but I do believe --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But do you stand by it, or is it

    17           just --

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I believe that the Internet is

    19           the most important communications innovation to human society

    20           since the development of the printing press.  So --

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Because it allows for -- because of

    23           it's many-to-many nature it allows for a level of

    24           communication and interactivity among human beings which is

    25           unprecedented in our society, and it also allows for

                                                                            82

     1           individuals in our society to have the opportunity to

     2           contribute information in a mechanism that was never before

     3           possible.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  In Paragraph 101 on Page

     5           22 you make the statement, "The act will have a negative

     6           impact on commercialization, because many providers will

     7           either exit the market or simply never enter."  I'm not quite

     8           sure why you say that.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I believe there is already a lot

    10           of evidence that the act will have negative consequences on

    11           commercialization of the Internet.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What evidence are you aware of in

    13           your area of expertise?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  From commercial providers and other

    15           people who are considering becoming commercial providers who

    16           are very concerned about the impact of the act either on

    17           their business or on potential for their business.  And --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you know that?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  How do I know --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you know that they're

    21           concerned?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Because they have told me.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And they have told you that

    24           they haven't entered the business or --

    25                    THE WITNESS:  They have told me that they're

                                                                            83

     1           considering -- I have had conversations with providers who

     2           are considering exiting the business, providers who already

     3           have, for example, removed material because they are

     4           uncertain of its impact on people, and people who were

     5           thinking of getting on line and are now very concerned.  For

     6           example, women who are considering getting into commercial

     7           enterprises.  I participated in a forum on Compuserve in a

     8           section devoted to women and business, and I was presented as

     9           an expert that the women could interact with -- or men too,

    10           but it largely drew women who were very interested in

    11           starting up enterprises that in some way involved the

    12           Internet.  And for women the Internet can represent a very

    13           interesting business opportunity because it presents the

    14           potential to work at home, for example, so you could still be

    15           involved in the rearing of your children and you could still

    16           potentially run a very profitable business yet out of your

    17           house, which is another example of how it's democratic

    18           because the entry barriers are very low, you don't need a lot

    19           of capital investment in order to set up a site on the

    20           Worldwide Web.  However, the women are very concerned about

    21           not only the technical issues involved or some of the more

    22           maybe conceptual issues with how would I use this medium, but

    23           also the legal issues of what will it mean for me, this is

    24           now too complicated, I won't be able to figure it out, you

    25           know, I'm just not going to get involved in this.  And, so, I

                                                                            84

     1           do see in my work an enormous amount of concern on the part

     2           of providers or potential providers, and in fact I would

     3           suggest that the concern is even more potent for the small

     4           providers.  And, so, from the perspective of, say, the small

     5           business or an individual business person or what we might

     6           refer to as a mom-and-pop that the fear is very real.  It

     7           might be less of a concern for Time Warner who may feel, oh,

     8           well, we will have the legal resources to deal with these

     9           issues as they arise, but for small providers that's not the

    10           case.  And, so, in that sense the democratic, open, low-

    11           barrier nature of the net becomes at risk.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And lastly, just to make sure

    13           I understand your testimony, Paragraphs 107 through 111, the

    14           figures in those paragraphs, do they all come from Mr.

    15           Lottor?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  No, they come from a number of

    17           different sources.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, could you briefly

    19           summarize for us where they come from?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  The source in Paragraph 107 --

    21           well, actually I should clarify that most of these numbers if

    22           we were to trace them back come from Mark Lottor's analysis

    23           of host counts on the Worldwide Web, the data are then

    24           reanalyzed by primarily two different individuals, the first

    25           individual is Tony Rutkowski, he was --

                                                                            85

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could you spell that, please?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, R-u-t-k-o-w-s-k-i.  He was

     3           formerly the director of the Internet Society and he is now

     4           with General Magic, a software company in California.  And

     5           Mr. Rutkowski performs reinterpretations or reanalyses or re-

     6           parsings of Mr. Lottor's data, which is just presented in a

     7           tabular form, it is not particularly interesting from a

     8           commercial perspective.  And, so, these data come from him or

     9           from Mr. Quarterman, who runs a strategic consulting firm for

    10           Internet use in Austin and also performs reanalyses for

    11           strategic purposes.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, are those in articles that have

    13           been published?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  No, they're on the Internet, they are

    15           not in -- do not appear in peer-reviewed journals.  These

    16           numbers change the next day.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Dr. Hoffman, do the -- let

    19           me take you to the concept of flow that you talk about in

    20           your declaration and a little bit in your examination here

    21           today.  Do the experts in the field of psychology accept the

    22           concept of flow?  In other words, is it a recognized concept

    23           by respected scientists in the field?  I'm not sure that's

    24           exactly the Daubert standard, but we'll --

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, the answer is yes.  The

                                                                            86

     1           concept was developed by a psychologist, Mahayli Gezens (ph.)

     2           Mahayli, and he has done some work on his own, with his wife

     3           and many other co-authors, all of it published in peer-

     4           reviewed, refereed scholarly journals in the psychological

     5           literature.  And he has actually written several popular

     6           books on the topic, one of the best known is Flow:  The

     7           Psychology of Optimal Experience, which is a book not exactly

     8           for the lay person, but more popular than his other scholarly

     9           work.  He has developed the concept in a very generic

    10           context, in other words, that flow is a construct that

    11           describes people's experiences in situations I described

    12           previously, for example playing chess, rock climbing,

    13           dancing, things of that nature.  Additionally, the concept

    14           has achieved recognition in the organizational studies

    15           literature by workers who are studying human-computer

    16           interaction and believe that the concept also has merit and

    17           utility there.  So, for --

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, was -- then is this concept

    19           of flow as related to this interactive computer relationship,

    20           is that also accepted in peer-review articles?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Well, yes, I'm happy to say now that

    22           it is, because that is our concept and our paper on that

    23           topic will appear in July in the Journal of Marketing, which

    24           is the top journal in the marketing field and is peer-

    25           reviewed, refereed and double-blind.

                                                                            87

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, but if you remove the

     2           concept of flow or you set it aside and this state called the

     3           pleasure of intrinsically motivated experiential flow state,

     4           all of which I gather means that people feel good --

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- when they use a computer, so

     7           that -- when it goes back and forth, you know --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes -- or -- well, yes.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  But if you set that concept

    10           aside at the moment would you still reach the bottom line,

    11           which I gather is the bottom line of some of your

    12           declaration, that it's important for users to be able to jump

    13           from hypertext link -- one hypertext link to another in a

    14           seamless fashion because it facilitates the use of the

    15           Internet or Worldwide Web as a goal-directed approach, by

    16           which I understand you are saying that this is a way of

    17           getting information, if you want information, it's the same

    18           as going to a library; a different method of going, but it's

    19           still important because it facilitates that kind of research,

    20           let us say.  Is that basically what it comes down to?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's -- no, that's exactly

    22           correct because, as we state in our research papers, the flow

    23           experience is not necessarily achievable by every person who

    24           gets on line --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I can understand that.

                                                                            88

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean, there might be -- I assume

     3           there might be frustrations as well.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes -- no, in fact we -- the reason

     5           that the flow concept is of interest is because it allows us

     6           to study precisely frustrations and the things that might

     7           keep people from having a good time or enjoying themselves. 

     8           Nevertheless, whether we could get into flow or not on any

     9           particular occasion or whether even I could ever get into

    10           flow, because we believe some people will never get there,

    11           the concept of network --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's like nirvana maybe.

    13                    (Laughter.)

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's related to peak experience,

    15           but not the same, yes.  Whether we --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I'm more interested in the

    17           concept of getting information, which I think --

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, we -- I completely believe that

    19           the -- 

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- is an entirely different

    21           concept.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, network navigation, the

    23           process exists regardless of whether you will achieve flow or

    24           be in the flow state or not during that process.  And network

    25           navigation is the process of self movement or direction

                                                                            89

     1           through cyberspace and that process is impeded or is

     2           potentially impeded by the idea of a necessity to register or

     3           to say, here I am now at yet another site, because

     4           potentially then I no longer can move seamlessly through

     5           cyberspace.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And then when you say seam -- what

     7           do you mean by seamlessly?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Seamlessly meaning from click to

     9           click.  There is a lot of evidence that the explosive growth

    10           of the Worldwide Web is due to word of mouth, which means

    11           that people see how exciting it is and then they tell someone

    12           else.  And the nature of that excitement comes from being

    13           able to one minute I'm in Paris, the next I'm in Finland.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, but if you set aside

    15           excitement, because I must -- I mean, set aside that concept

    16           and go to the information-retrieval sort of concept, then you

    17           would put seamless -- is it fair -- because I'm just trying

    18           to understand what you're saying in language I can

    19           understand, is it fair that you analogize seamlessness to

    20           walking into a public library without having to register?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, exactly.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, then I understand.  Thank

    23           you.

    24                    Did our questions elicit -- evoke any questions by

    25           counsel?

                                                                            90

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But you're saying that from, as it

     2           were, a marketing analysis point of view that the

     3           seamlessness of going from hyperlink to hyperlink is itself

     4           what has attracted so many people to use this innovation?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Well, not even from a marketing point

     6           of view, I'm suggesting from a human communication point of

     7           view.  So, it's much broader than from a commercial

     8           perspective, because we also study the behavioral aspects of

     9           being in cyberspace.  And it is this ability to move

    10           seamlessly through the Worldwide Web that we believe has

    11           contributed to its explosive growth, yes.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, you're saying they get a high

    13           when they can jump from one link to another like I or Judge

    14           Dalzell or Judge Buckwalter might get a high just by going

    15           into a library and being able --

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- being able to look at the books?

    18                    (Laughter.)

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Other people might not, but we

    20           might.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  But some people will, that's right. 

    22           And notice that your high of being able to look at the books

    23           is very nonlinear.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But it's more than a high, isn't it? 

    25           I mean, it's a little more mundane than a high, it's just

                                                                            91

     1           easy, it's just easy?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  It's easy, yes, it's easy; you might

     3           get high, you might not, but it's easy.

     4                    (Laughter.)

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron, I apparently evoked some

     6           questions -- or maybe Judge Dalzell did from you.

     7                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

     8           BY MR. BARON:  

     9           Q   Professor Hoffman, in response to Judge Dalzell's

    10           questions you mentioned some out-of-court statements of women

    11           being concerned or others being concerned about the effect of

    12           the act and you hearing them say that to you, correct?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   And you stated that some of these women or others

    15           represent mom-and-pop businesses or small business providers,

    16           correct?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   Do any of these mom-and-pop businesses or small business

    19           providers, are they in the business of providing sexually

    20           explicit materials?

    21           A   I don't know, I mean, some of them might be.  Some of

    22           these conversations take place on an on-line community called

    23           "the Well" and, while I know the people's names, I don't

    24           necessarily know the nature of their business.

    25           Q   You can't give any concrete examples of the nature of the

                                                                            92

     1           businesses where people are concerned about the effect of the

     2           Communications Decency Act?

     3           A   You mean do I know the particular lines of work?  Well,

     4           in the case of people that are thinking about getting into

     5           the business they are very vague in the sense that they are

     6           thinking of providing some sort of information.  And in fact

     7           a lot of times we get calls from people who would like us to

     8           consult on projects in which they say what would the

     9           opportunities be and, so, part of the work is to try to

    10           identify, here are some opportunities for providing

    11           information in cyberspace that might be profitable.  In other

    12           cases, like, for example, there are people who sell T-shirts

    13           on line, things of that nature, people who sell posters.  I'm

    14           trying to think of ones that I know about, things -- those

    15           are what I would consider small providers or mom-and-pops,

    16           people selling catalogues to information, stuff like that.

    17                    MR. BARON:  I have nothing further.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Hansen?

    19                            FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    20           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    21           Q   Professor Hoffman, I would first like to follow up on

    22           Judge Buckwalter's question about moderated news groups.  Do

    23           you know what percentage of UseNet news groups are moderated

    24           in the way Mr. Fowell was suggesting in the Atlantic article?

    25           A   No, I have no idea.

                                                                            93

     1           Q   Do you think that the percentage of moderated UseNet news

     2           groups is a relatively small percentage?

     3           A   I -- well, out of 15,000 I would guess that it is,

     4           because I believe it to be the case that most of the news

     5           groups on UseNet news are not moderated.

     6           Q   I would also like to follow up just a second on the Chief

     7           Judge's question when she asked you about is it like getting

     8           into the library without having to check in at the front

     9           desk.  Is the nature of the hyperlink process such that you

    10           can go effortlessly from the fourth floor of Widener Library

    11           in Boston to the third floor of Carnegie Mellon's library

    12           in...

    13                    UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Pittsburgh.

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  Pittsburgh, I'm sorry.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    17           Q   In Pittsburgh without ever having to travel back and

    18           forth, is that the nature of what hyperlinks are all about?

    19           A   Yes.  And even more than that though, if we -- once we

    20           went from a library in one city and one state to a library in

    21           another city and another state through one click, it's also

    22           the case that it would be as if every single book on every

    23           single shelf you had to register, because every single page

    24           would require some sort of registration process.  So, it

    25           would be much more onerous than simply checking in at the

                                                                            94

     1           door, it would be every single book I wanted to select I

     2           would have to go through a process to determine whether I

     3           could select it or not.

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any more?  The Court would like the

     6           plaintiffs at some appropriate time to annotate Dr. Hoffman's

     7           declaration with the sources that she gave us in testimony,

     8           because I think maybe many of us did not have an opportunity

     9           to put them down.  Is there any objection to that?

    10                    MR. BARON:  No, your Honor.

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  We would be happy to do so, your Honor.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, thank you.  Thank you

    13           very much.

    14                    (Witness excused.)

    15                    (Discussion held off the record.)
