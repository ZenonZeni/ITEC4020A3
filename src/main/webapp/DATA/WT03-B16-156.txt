<img src="../graphics/streetboys.gif" border=0 align=right valign=top><b>Try explaining the butter on her popcorn</b>...The highlight of the first trip abroad for a Hanoian waitress was her initiation to Western cinema in Bangkok. "There are two great movies which were previewed that I now want to watch. One is 'Independence Day,' the other is 'Coming Soon!'"<p>

<b>Next time, call first</b>...Nothing like those intrusive foreign journalists. CBS News, 48-Hours reporter Roberta Baskin didn't know what she was in for when she crashed Nike's headquarters in HCMC, cameras rolling, trying to get an interview for a story on Nike's shoe factories in Vietnam. American viewers got a taste of what Sunday morning basketball players in Saigon are used to, when Nike manager <b>George Southrey</b> made a bee line for the cameraman and with a well-placed stiff arm over the camera lens, cut the interview short.<p>

<b>In town and looking to spend some money</b>...IFC Executive VP <b>Jannik Lindeaek</b> was in Hanoi meeting with government leaders and pursuing investments in small to mid-sized enterprises. The World Bank's private lending arm has so far invested <b>$830 million in 15 projects</b>.<p>

<b>Web Site of the Month</b>...(not coming to a server near you): "Min Min's Viet Cong Cyber Cafe" Motto: <b>"Charlie Don't Websurf!"</b> Content: Social Evils.<p>

<b>Love in Vietnam comes at a price</b>...Famed HCMC actor <b>Le Cong Tuan Anh</b>, Vietnam's Tom Cruise, perhaps best known for his 1993 smash hit Vi Dang Tinh Yeu (Chili Pepper of Love), sadly expired on October 17 after drinking alcoholic beverages along with some 70 pharmaceuticals. His death was reported as a suicide. Friends told Love Newspaper that he was despondent following his breakup with local runway model, <b>Minh Anh</b>, of Hanoi.<p>

<b>Like we said</b>...Foreign men are marrying Vietnamese women at a fast clip--according to one state newspaper. In Hanoi four such marriages take place a week, and in HCMC it's eight a day! The bad news is that the divorce rates are keeping pace. Last year the HCMC Court settled 395 divorce cases involving foreign spouses, 40% of the nation's total.<p>

<b>Although the Hamburglar was recently seen in Danang</b>...<b>McDonald's</b> reps recently stayed at Ministry of Defense Palace in Hanoi and scouted the local market for potential McCustomers. Conclusion: not yet. For now Hanoians Jonesing for processed cow are best directed to the Shepherd's Pie section of Western Canned Goods Shop.<p>

<b>No more free lunch</b>...an expat favorite, the <b>Hoa Sua Cafe</b>, is threatened with extinction as its lease has expired. Established two years ago by an NGO to serve bistro food like goat cheese crisps and fresh salads, the cafe helped poor street kids find work as waiters, and offered prices easy on expats' wallets. Inspired by the success of the rambling indoor/outdoor cafe, it is rumored that the cafe's landlord is going to give the cafe thing a whirl himself. While everyone would like Vietnam to adopt a market economy, <b>aren't expats entitled to at least one subsidized cafe?</b><p>

<b>"I'll have the athlete's-foot and vinegar dressing</b>"...said our intrepid man in Hanoi, <b>Josh Levine</b>, when he walked into a crafts shop looking to buy some kitchenware. With one utensil in each hand, he asked clerk the price of the salad spoons. The clerk looked at him as if he were a crazy person and told him he was holding two <b>mother-of-pearl shoe horns</b>.<p>

<b>Who says golf is for wimps?</b>...At the recent <b>Song Be Charity Golf Open</b>, 77 year old <b>Sven Palm</b>, Honorary Patron of the Palm-Song Be Resort, gave a <b>gutsy performance</b>. Recovering from illness, braving the midday heat with only his hat and some medication (a cart was unthinkable for this Swedish Air Force Captain), Palm stoicly played nine holes, and resoundingly defeated his VBJ playing partner.<p>

<b>What? You just had Elvis Cong a year ago</b>...For $50 or $65 a seat, you too could have watched <b>Sting</b> perform for HCMC's masses in mid-October. Couldn't have watched his rendition of <b>"The Russians (love their children too),"</b> though. Banned.<p>

<b>How about throwing in some free lacquerware for anyone that visits?</b>...The number of tourists visiting Hanoi plummeted 39% this year, from 358,400 in '95 to only 190,000 through the first nine months of '96. Hanoi Tourism's director was perplexed: "We thought tourism growth would gain momentum by itself. We did not consider what tourists would like to see or experience when they were here."<p>

<b>Comings and goings</b>....Hello in HCMC to <b>Mark Hoffman</b>, head of <b>Mekong Films</b>, moved from Hanoi...<b>Nick Freeman</b>, now running Indochina research for <b>ING/Barings</b>, out of Bangkok...<b>Ted Osius</b>, of the US Charge D'Affaires office...<b>AP's</b> new Hanoi chief <b>Ian Stewart</b>, who transferred from suburban Kabul three days before it fell...and <b>Eric Rehmann</b>, back from Washington as President of <b>Vatico</b>...so long to <b>James Rockwell</b>, enjoying a new baby and home in Idaho, <b>Lufthansa's Klaus Schmidt</b>, who left HCMC for Cairo....<b>Kelly Sachsenmier</b> of <b>OpSmile</b>, goin' home to Georgia (Yankees Rule!) after two years in Hanoi, <b>DMJM's Julie Amato</b>, off to the states for a Ph.D...<b>Philip Colin</b> has left <b>Beta Fund</b>, although is expected to continue investing in Vietnam...<b>Shekhar Sawant, ANZ's</b> chief manager and Hanoi's most colorful expat for over two years, is off to ANZ in Madras India,...after a summer series of goodbye parties, <b>V-Trac's Paul Savage</b> also flew the coop. And <b>FEER</b> correspondent <b>Adam Schwarz</b> said farewell to Hanoi on Halloween. Spooooky!
