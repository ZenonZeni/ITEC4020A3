Lithium Studies and Manic Depression
</H1>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<B>Ronald R. Fieve, M.D., Chief of Psychiatric Research</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
This past year the Department of Lithium Studies continued to screen for mood disorders in new patients who came to the clinic from the neighboring community, New York City, and the surrounding states. We treated patients by giving them psychotropic medications that have been shown to correct alterations in brain chemistry and to address their social needs. In turn, we collected detailed data for our research projects that focus on the multifactorial causes of mood disorders. Our research encompasses the genetic, biological, psychogenic, and environmental factors and their interplay.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Once more we were reminded of the fact that the clinic model we have been using for over 20 years at the New York State Psychiatric Institute is presently the new focus of New York State's mental health system as it is emphasizing "preventive" psychiatric services at the community level (OMH News, September 1994) rather than treatment after an acute episode occurs. The "well-patient" community clinics, which Dr. Fieve and his team initiated in the early 1970s, are an effective and low-cost way of treating large numbers of patients who live at home and receive treatment on an outpatient basis.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our research this year was supported by the Marmot Foundation, the Milhauser grant, and the Depression Research Fund.

Our specialized clinic at Psychiatric Institute focuses on patients who otherwise would not have access to therapy because of their financial and socioeconomic status. The main goal was to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of subsequent affective episodes and make them functioning members of the community.

The Lithium Clinic's Head Research Nurse, Annemarie Schlegel, RN, participated in treatment, research, and clinical care of patients.

<B>Psychopharmacotherapy  </B>Projects during the year have included a study comparing a new third generation antidepressant paroxetine (Paxil) with a traditional tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (Tofranil) in depressed patients. There were no significant differences between the two drugs in alleviating the symptoms of depression. However, paroxetine appeared to have more beneficial effects on the anxiety symptoms that are frequently associated with depression when compared to imipramine. Side effects for paroxetine were typical of other drugs that enhance serotonergic function but different from those of imipramine. We found paroxetine to be an effective and safe medication for controlling depression especially in the elderly, whose treatment often is complicated by age and related comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We also continued our study on the effectiveness of fluoxetine (Prozac), the first of the new class of antidepressant compounds (the so-called, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in the treatment of major depressive disorder. We found Prozac to be as effective in treating depression as the standard tricyclic antidepressants. Patients taking Prozac experienced fewer side effects when compared with the traditionally used antidepressants. We demonstrated that Prozac can be prescribed to patients suffering from dysthymia, (the milder form of major depression) and obsessive-compulsive disorder, as well as to patients who suffer from bulimia.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Fieve's book Prozac: Questions and Answers for Patients, Family, and Physicians, published by Avon Books in April 1994, puts forth for the general public the current thinking of our research group about Prozac.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Using a longitudinal life-table model analysis, we assessed the prophylactic efficacy of lithium alone, administered within the context of a naturalistic clinical setting, by calculating the probability patients remaining free of an affective episode (manic or depressive) over a five-year course. In addition, for those who suffered a manic or depressive relapse, we attempted to analyze the subsequent course of patients who were then restabilized on lithium plus either a neuroleptic, carbamazepine, or a benzodiazepine, or lithium plus an antidepressant. Lithium alone offered an average 83% probability against an affective relapse after one year, 52% after three years, and 37% after five years. For patients who failed on lithium alone, it appeared that combination treatment offered greater protection against subsequent affective relapses than the initial course on lithium alone.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We also continued to investigate alternatives to lithium to help those patients who are not able to take lithium due to kidney disease, cardiovascular problems, severe lithium intolerance, or electrolyte conditions. Our studies show carbamazepine, valproic acid, and klonopin to be effective alternatives in many manic depressive patients. In addition, we examined personality traits before and after pharmacological treatment for depression. We concluded, based on our data, that the melancholic subtype of depression is associated with greater frequency of Cluster A personality disorders than the non-melancholics. The department's research was done in collaboration with The Foundation for Depression and Manic Depression and Dr. Fieve's team at Columbia University.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Genetics  </B>In a collaborative study with Dr. Miron Baron of the Department of Medical Genetics, we continued to collect epidemiological data from our Columbia University and Foundation patient populations. This study also included bipolar patients from other clinics in the US and abroad, thus making it the largest bipolar pedigree study reported to date. Results suggest that X-chromosome linkage can be applied to a small subgroup of bipolar cases; however, in light of conflicting findings and methodological uncertainties in studying a disorder with unclear phenotype and complex linkage data, an extension and re-evaluation of published data will be required to further an understanding of this intriguing hypothesis.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
We continue to educate the public at large as well as professionals at conferences <BR>
in the US and abroad. The staff was also available for Columbia students and for resident teaching.

Dr. Fieve appeared on CNN-"Sonya Live," on Channel 17-"Turning Point," Channel 1-"Good Day New York," and a number of radio shows discussing the affective disorders, in particular, depression and the effectiveness of Prozac and other SSRIs in treatment of this often debilitating illness. Two posters at the 33rd Annual ACNP meeting addressed the issues of the relationship between melancholia and personality and placebo response in depressive illness.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
At the sesquicentennial meeting of the American Psychiatric Association this past year, Dr. Fieve's work on lithium was considered one of several "milestones in American Psychiatry's first 150 years."
