<b>GEELONG & DISTRICT</b>
</FONT><br>
</center>
<p><br>
<BODY>
<FONT SIZE="+2">
Geelong is Australia's eleventh-largest city and one
of the country's leading industrial centres.
<P>
Geelong's resource-rich hinterland provides the raw materials
industry needs, while its combination of direct sea and land routes
give companies access to local, interstate and overseas markets.
 These natural advantages are backed by a highly-developed industrial
infrastructure which is complemented by a skilled and highly-productive
workforce.
</FONT>
<H2>Victoria's largest provincial city</H2>
<P>
Geelong is located just one hour southwest of Melbourne, on the
shores of Corio Bay.  Greater Geelong is Victoria's largest provincial
centre with a population of 197,000.
<P>
Geelong offers an excellent choice of housing, employment opportunities,
retailing and commercial services as well as a superb range of
educational, recreational and public health facilities.
<P>
For business, the benefits of diversity built up over a century
of manufacturing have led to the creation of an industrial and
commercial infrastructure offering almost total self-sufficiency.
<H2>Links with the world</H2>
<P>
Road, rail, sea and air services link Geelong and District with
the rest of the country and the world.  Geelong is situated at
the junction of five main highways, and more than 100 carriers
and transport companies are based locally.
<P>
Geelong Airport at Grovedale is just eight kilometres south of
the city.  Chartered flights in light aircraft are available to
Melbourne and other regional centres.  The airfield also operates
scenic flights and flight training.
<P>
AeroSpace Technologies of Australia's (ASTA) facility at Avalon
has a runway capable of handling the largest commercial aircraft.
 It has a world competitive military aircraft-building capacity
and commercial aircraft heavy maintenance facility.
<P>
Large land reserves are available to develop a world-class freight
handling and storage facility, and Avalon has the potential to
become the centre of a fresh food road freight complex processing,
packing, storing and consigning locally grown produce onto world
markets.
<P>
Geelong's rail links to Melbourne, Warrnambool and Adelaide have
been significantly improved by its inclusion on the
National Standard Gauge Railway Network. This will open up additional
avenues for increased trade.
<P>
The Port of Geelong includes eight major piers and wharves which
provide twenty-one berths to handle specialist and general cargo.
The installation of sophisticated full roll-on-roll-off dry bulk
handling facilities reflects the port's importance.
<H2>Business services</H2>
<P>
Geelong and District's businesses have access to a wide network
of highly developed professional and technical support services
such as information technology consultants and personnel recruitment
and placement agencies. They also have the support of locally
based trade organisations.
<P>
The region has specialised shops as well as branches of most major
national and metropolitan department stores, and is serviced
by all major financial institutions.
<H2>Well looked after</H2>

<P>
Geelong has three major hospitals, the Geelong Hospital, a 600-bed
public and training hospital with private and intermediate beds,
and two major private hospitals.  A number of specialist care
facilities serve Geelong, including the Grace McKellar Centre,
Kalkee, Shannon Park Spastic Centre and Karingal.
<P>
Educational institutions range from preschool to university level,
including the well-known Geelong Grammar, Geelong College and
Morongo.
<P>
Deakin University has facilities for the mature-aged, distance
education studies and courses for people lacking formal university
entrance qualifications.  Deakin is committed to strengthening
links with the commercial sector.
<P>
Gordon Technical College maintains close contact with Geelong's
industrial and commercial training needs by training apprentices
and trainees, creating industry specific courses, and presenting
management courses.
<p><H2>Manufacturing industries dominate</H2>
<center><img src="gifs2/ggrefin.gif"></center>
<P>
Particular strengths lie in textiles, and Geelong hosts two of
Australia's leading carpet manufacturers, Godfrey Hirst and Brintons.
<P>
The region is also strong in non-metallic mineral products (Geelong
Cement and Blue Circle cement works), basic metal products (Alcoa
Aluminium Smelter) and transport equipment (Ford).  The chemical
industry is well represented in Geelong by Shell and Rohm Haas.
<P>
Greater Geelong offers prospective firms an extensive labour pool.
 The population growth rate of Greater Geelong exceeds that of
Melbourne, and the trend is expected to continue.
<H2>Industrial land available</H2>
<P>
The region has available a range of differently-zoned, established
industrial sites.
<P>
Vacant industrial land is available for development in urban Geelong.
This ranges from partially serviced sites to those with the entire
infrastructure in place, at extremely competitive prices.
<P>
The City of Greater Geelong assists companies to obtain a location
tailored to their needs.
<P>
Industrial estates range in size from small coastal developments,
ideal for light industry, to areas such as Heales Road, Lara,
offering broadacre sites with ready access to major road, rail
and port handling facilities.
<H2>Research &amp; development</H2>
<img src="gifs2/gghang.gif" align=right>
<P>
Geelong's strong agricultural and manufacturing base has provided
the incentive to develop a number of research institutions. These
highlight Geelong's suitability as a location for R&amp;D.
<P>
The CSIRO, for example, is providing industry with the techniques
to pursue new developments in wool scouring and carbonising. The
Gordon Technical College is gaining wide recognition in the fields
of fluid power, pneumatics and hydraulics, while the Marine Science
Laboratories are working to capitalise on the potential for oyster
and mussel farming in Corio Bay.
<P>
The Australian Animal Health Laboratory's advances in biotechnology
are putting the region at the forefront in animal vaccines and
toxicology support for pharmaceutical companies and the Australian
rural community.
<P>
Deakin University's Centre for Research in Intelligent Systems
has developed the use of microwave sensors in areas as diverse
as road traffic control and rice grain inspection.
<H2>Recreational choices</H2>
<img src="gifs2/ggriver.gif" align=right>
<P>
The region has a wide range of recreational choices that offer
something for everyone, tourists and residents alike.  Over a
million visits are made to the region annually.
<P>
Tourists can walk in the cool fern forests of the nearby Otway
Ranges, or fish in Corio Bay, the rivers, or Bass Strait. Approximately
twenty picturesque golf courses are scattered throughout the region.
<P>
Leisurely drives along the rugged coastline take in one of the
world's great ocean drives -the Great Ocean Road.
<P>
Sports enthusiasts can follow the Geelong Football Club (The Cats),
or the National Basketball League games to watch Geelong's own
Supercats.  The Geelong Cricket Club has re-entered the Victorian
Cricket Association.
<P>
Art and culture lovers can enjoy excellent performances at the
Geelong Performing Arts Centre.  They can visit exhibitions at
Geelong Art Gallery and the many private galleries.
<P>
With over fifty attractions like the National Wool Museum or the
historical maritime town of Queenscliff, visitors are never short
of things to do.  In addition, a number of major tourist events
take place every year.  Bells Beach is the annual host to the
world surf championships during Easter, and the Australian International
Airshow, will be held again at Avalon in 1997 and 1999.
The Barwon River
is home to the annual Head of the River rowing regatta.
<P>
Greater Geelong and District is an ideal location for investment.
 Its well developed infrastructure, broad-based manufacturing,
increasing involvement in resource and processing industries,
commitment to R&amp;D, rapidly growing high-technology industries
and its people, combined with the area's natural beauty and man-made
amenities, offer excellent investment and development opportunities.
