<p><strong>The Challenges</strong>
<P>
For PV to meet its promise, both in terms of an energy technology and in terms of a domestic
industry, we must do two major things. 
<P>
First, we must ensure that the U.S. PV industry not only grows into a large domestic industry but
also that it remains competitive in the world PV markets. This means we must maintain the
technical superiority of our products. U.S. industry has been a leader in PV technology thanks to
the ongoing support of the National Photovoltaics Program and the tenacity of the U.S.
companies. To maintain this leadership, the program and the companies must continue their
close collaboration.

<TD><font color="#F79D00">The potential market for PV is staggering. Since 1988, the worldwide demand for PV has grown from 33 megawatts per year to 84 megawatts per
year, an increase of nearly 255%. During the same period, U.S. PV companies have increased
their module shipments by more than 310% and have increased their share of the world PV
market to 41%. Through close collaboration with industry, we intend to maintain this growth.</font></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
Second, for PV to be seriously considered as a major energy option, we must expand old
markets and enter new ones by making PV competitive in a wider variety of applications and
with more forms of electrical generation. 
<P>

<TABLE WIDTH=360>
<TR>
<TD><font color="#F79D00">Following its success in space, PV power came down to Earth in the
1970s to find other niche markets in the armed forces and a small number of remote-power
applications.  As these markets continued to grow, the 1980s witnessed a proliferation of PV-
powered consumer products.  In the 1990s, PV systems emerged into municipal applications in
the United States and began to power homes and communities in the developing world.  The
domestic utility market is now gradually opening up, with building-mounted and local grid
support expected to be well established by the year 2005.  Soon after that, PV electricity is
expected to be cost competitive for utility bulk power applications.</font>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
To accomplish both of these objectives, we must reduce the cost of PV systems while making
them more reliable, durable, and convenient to use. This has been the constant aim of the
National Photovoltaics Program.  Since 1980, we have worked with industry to reduce the cost
of PV-generated electricity to about 25 cents per kilowatt-hour and increase module lifetimes to
20 years. Continuing to do so will make PV systems as attractive to consumers as the next best
alternative for a wide spectrum of electric power applications.
