<H4>NAMI and Brain Disorders:  Open Your Mind <BR>
by Annie Saylor, NAMI President </H4> 
<P>
	Two people with dopamine-related brain disorders reside at my  
parent's home in Kentucky.  Both have lost some functioning in a  
portion of the brain--one's loss affects motor control and the  
other's loss affects control of thoughts and emotions.  Both take  
medications to relieve their symptoms.  Neither disorder is  
curable, nor are the causes of either's disorder completely known.  
 Both see specialists for their treatment, both need supports to  
make it possible for them to live at home, and both work at  
recovery and at learning to live with and surmount their disorders.  
 One has Parkinson's, and the other has been diagnosed with  
schizophrenia. 
 <P>
	Try to imagine a world in which these disorders have the same  
public acceptance and equality in insurance, treatment and recovery  
options, job training and opportunities, and housing.  Distance  
yourself just once from the "mental illness" mindset and envision a  
world in which our disorders are brain disorders, in which the  
steps are diagnosis, treatment, supports, and then getting on with  
life.  Picture not being stuck forever in the mental illness  
quagmire. 
	 <P>
Some would say this is an impossible dream, that the term brain  
disorder doesn't sound serious enough, and that we must cling to  
the word mental because somehow our disorders are different.  Our  
membership was divided 50-50 in the vote on this subject at the  
recent NAMI annual convention. 
 <P>
	Neither Parkinson's nor schizophrenia is fully characterized  
by the term brain disorder, for their impact on lives goes far  
beyond that.  Neither my sister with schizophrenia nor my mother  
with Parkinson's is completely described by the term person with a  
brain disorder.  Yet why should it be more acceptable to call  
Parkinson's a brain disorder and not schizophrenia?  To insist that  
schizophrenia is mental, psychiatric, or behavioral is equivalent  
to calling Parkinson's a motor control, a stiff-limbs, or a  
trembling disorder. 
 <P>
	Because of the discriminations we have experienced, the need  
for protected funding for mental illness has been important.  In a  
short time we have seen that eroded as managed care has taken over.  
 We will likely see more erosion as block grants are deemed the  
solution to necessary budget cuts.  Mental illness is being  
mainstreamed, whether we like it or not.  Which is more likely to  
be understood by our legislators as they make the difficult  
decisions?  Mental illness, which becomes confused with mental  
health and gets written off as too expensive?  Or brain disorders,  
which forces them to recognize the discrimination they are  
perpetuating if they do not support our efforts? 
 <P>
	I often compare my family's reaction when my sister was  
diagnosed with the reaction to my mother's diagnosis.  In my  
sister's case we felt the emotional equivalent of an atomic bomb  
and wandered like its victims through the rubble of our lives.  We  
were dismayed to learn of my mother's diagnosis, but we knew so  
much more about what to expect.  And the stigma was non-existent.   
I envision a day when the impact on a family of a mental illness  
diagnosis is no different from that of all other brain disorders;  
when the professionals treating these disorders are not viewed  
differently;  when the treatment and recovery supports for these  
disorders have parity.  One step toward this vision--Open your  
mind: mental illnesses are brain disorders.
