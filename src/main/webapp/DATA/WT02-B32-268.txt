<b><h3><center>NEWSNET ROARS INTO 1997</b></h3></center>

Bryn Mawr, PA (January 15, 1997)--NewsNet came roaring into 1997 with additional staff and brand new content, 
all designed to continue the tradition of excellence users have come to expect
from NewsNet.<P>

Experienced staff have been added to the customer support, sales, and 
marketing departments to meet growing demand for NewsNet services.  The 
company is experiencing unprecedented growth since the successful launch of 
NewsNet on the Web in October.<P>

NewsNet's Web product continues to soar as users warm to its easy-to-use 
interface and its affordable introductory subscription price.  "With an 
appealing price of just $19.95 per month for the basic plan, interest in 
NewsNet on the Web is very high" states Andrew S. Elston, NewsNet's president.
Once a user subscribes to NewsNet on the Web, the only other cost encountered 
is for full text or KWICs.  And, the cost of KWICs is "forgiven" when full 
text of the article is purchased.<P>


With NewsNet on the Web there are no connect fees, no search fees, and no 
charge for three-line briefs, or retrieval of hits.  All headlines display the
cost of full-text before a purchase is made.  In addition, subscribers can 
take advantage of Browse Headlines which allows browsing titles and tables of 
contents, at no charge. Or, users can partake of free "Hot" headlines of the 
day, and access to Quote.com for timely stock and securities information, 
again, all at no additional cost.<P>

During 1996, NewsNet increased content in its database by over 15% in the 
areas of telecommunications, environment, health and pharmaceuticals, and 
international business.  Moving into 1997 the company has set its sights even 
higher and is already off to a great start with many negotiations in progress.
Some of the new titles NewsNet users can look forward to in 1997 are: 
<I>Buyouts, Computerworld Philippines, Display Technology News, Europe Energy,
Europe Environment, Investor Relations Business, Private Label Card Bulletin, 
U.S. Department of Agriculture Trade Leads, India Business & Investment 
Report, Virtual Finance Report, and Mergers and Restructuring.</I><P>
