<H3>About <I>The Life Centered Career Education Curriculum (LCCE)</H3></I>
<I><BR> 
LCCE </I>is an education system designed to provide special education and other "at risk" students with the 
important skills needed to function successfully as productive workers in the school, home, and community. The 
LCCE materials are grounded in 15 years of research. They have been field-tested in schools across the country 
and adopted by many school districts as the preferred transition curriculum.<BR> 
     <BR> 
The LCCE approach addresses the question, "What skills must the individual have to become a participating 
member of society?" Based on extensive and continued research, 22 major skills or competencies have been 
identified as critical for students to acquire for adult success. The 22 competencies fall under one of three 
curriculum areas: <BR> 
     Daily Living Skills, <BR> 
     Personal-Social Skills, <BR> 
     Occupational Guidance and Preparation.<BR> 
     <BR> 
Instruction of the 22 competency areas is organized into four stages of career development in a scope and 
sequence that begins with career/self-
awareness and continues through career exploration, preparation, and assimilation. Although much of the 
instruction will occur in school, considerable home- and community-based experiences are emphasized. The 
curriculum includes over 1,100 lesson plans. Knowledge and Performance Batteries have also been developed to 
assess student performance.<BR> 
     <BR> 
The LCCE competency units satisfy functional objectives that are an important part of Individualized Education 
Programs and Transition Plans for students with disabilities. In addition, the specificity of the lesson plans 
enables teachers to easily implement the Life Centered Career Education approach in their communities and 
classrooms. <p>
