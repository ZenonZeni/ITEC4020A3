<b>Dr John Heap</b>, Director
<p>

When I took up the Directorial reins it was clear that my tenure
would be dominated by two issues: provision of space for expansion
of the Library and archives, and arriving at arrangements whereby
University officers on the Institute's staff could participate
more fully in the teaching mission of the University. There were
important and welcome developments on both these fronts during
the year.
<P>
Shortly after World War II it became apparent that a sea change
was likely to come over polar activity. The days of polar exploration,
in the sense of discovering new land, were moving towards a close,
and were being replaced by an era of polar scientific research
in the sense of explaining polar phenomena and relating the polar
regions to the rest of the planet. Perhaps that change is best
epitomized by the International Geophysical Year of 1957-58, which
began life as a proposal for a Third International Polar Year,
following those of 1882 and 1932. It also became apparent that
this change would be accompanied by a vast increase in polar information,
as many more nations become involved in polar research.
<P>
Dr Brian Roberts, then a Research Fellow in the Institute with
a part time appointment in the UK Foreign Office, foresaw this
increase in polar information and saw also the need for its collection,
as far as possible, in one place, and for its organisation in
accordance with a bibliographic system that other polar libraries
would be encouraged to adopt. Thus did the Institute become accredited
to the Federation Internationale de Documentation and developed
the Universal Decimal Classification for use in Polar Libraries.
By the early 1960s, the explosion in polar information had become
a reality, and the library storage capacity of the Memorial Building
promised soon to be overwhelmed. In the early years of Dr Gordon
Robin's directorship, the Ford Foundation responded magnificently
to the Institute's need, and in 1968 Dr Laurence Gould, a member
of the Ford Foundation and an Antarctic geologist, opened the
Ford Wing of the Institute. It was expected that the space thus
made available would meet the Library's needs to the end of the
century, but by the mid 1980s space was again becoming a problem,
which was partially relieved in 1988 by an addition during the
directorship of Dr Peter Wadhams.
<P>
By the beginning of the decade it was clear that to maintain the
Institute's position as the world's premier polar library required
that there should again be a forward leap of the same magnitude
as that which had been made possible by the Ford Foundation. It
was, therefore, with deep gratitude that we learned that the University
had responded to our need by promising &#163;350,000, on the understanding
that the Institute would raise a similar sum from outside sources,
and thus make possible the forward leap the Institute so sorely
needs. Over the same period it also became apparent that the Institute's
archive capacity was being stretched close to its limits and that
there was a need for photograph and film storage under closely
regulated environmental conditions that differ from those that
are appropriate for the storage of paper archives.
<P>
When the Ford Wing was built, it had been designed to accept a
further floor on top of the main part of the building. An architectural
feasibility study showed that such an addition would not provide
sufficient space, and that too much money would need to be spent
on strengthening the existing building to accept a further floor
with loading capacities sufficient to accept library usage. The
architectural study therefore suggested a three-part solution:
firstly, an extension to the basement area designed to house the
map collection, thus providing additional research space following
relocation of the maps from the top floor of the Ford Wing; secondly,
an increase in the space currently used by the general office
and library storage above it; and, thirdly, the building of a
three-floored library building in what is currently the car parking
space between the Institute and our boundary with the church to
the east. An elevation of this aspect of the planned development
is shown on the front cover of SPRI Review - 95. The approved
'tower' solution to linking the rectilinear Ford Wing with the
softer contours of the Memorial Building has been much appreciated
in both aesthetic and architectural terms. 
<P>
Lord Edward Shackleton, son of Sir Ernest, a lifelong friend of
the Institute, leader of the Oxford University expedition to Ellesmere
Island of 1934-35, and a great Parliamentarian, died on 22 September
1994. The opportunity to commemorate both Sir Ernest and Lord
'Eddie' by naming the new building the Shackleton Memorial Library
was immediately grasped and has been universally welcomed. Although
strictly lying outside the scope of this review, it is very good
to be able to report that we are already more than one-third of
our way towards realising the necessary funds from outside sources.
<P>
Departments in the University are reviewed on a roughly ten-year
cycle, and at other times in the event of an occurrence such as,
in the case of the Institute, the retirement of a director,
which makes a review opportune. Following reviews in 1979, 1983,
and 1987, the next General Board review was due in 1997, but following
the departure of Dr Julian Dowdeswell and Dr Robin Williams, reported
last year, it was agreed within the University that preparatory
work for that review should be brought forward. 
<P>
In 1979 the Council of the School of Physical Sciences reported
to the University <b>:</b>

<ul>
<li>There is a national need for the continuation of polar studies
in the United Kingdom, and the need is seen as likely to increase
rather than decrease in the future.

<li>An unparalleled concentration of institutions and individuals
with interests in the polar regions exists in Cambridge.

<li>In spite of the small number of its permanent staff, the
Scott Polar Research Institute has played a significant part in
polar studies on a worldwide basis and can be expected to continue
to do so.

<li>The work of the Institute is a worthy and proper use of the
University's hard-pressed resources and its position in the University
enables it to fulfil roles which it could not otherwise meet.
</ul><P>

The reviews of 1983 and 1987, following the retirements of Dr
Robin and Dr Drewry, respectively, from the directorship, warmly
endorsed these views. But all these reviews had another thread
in common, relating to the need for there to be a mechanism for
associating University officers in the Institute with relevant
undergraduate teaching departments 'for the mutual benefit of
both.' Changes in the government's funding model for universities,
from one predominantly historically based to one based on encouragement
of undergraduate teaching, has led to institutes, such as SPRI,
whose raison d'etre is oriented more to research than teaching,
and of which there are a multitude throughout the UK university
world, being in a financially exposed position. This development,
added to the well-attested academic arguments in favour of symbiosis
between teaching and research, has led to urgent consideration
of how best to achieve a steady continuation - and allow for expansion
- of polar studies in Cambridge, together with integration with
undergraduate teachings. It should be recorded in this context,
and particularly as it relates to the first of the 1979 views
quoted above, that the Higher Education Funding Council for England
notified the University during the year of a grant of &#163;90,000,
as a non-formula funding for polar studies in the 1995-96 funding
allocation.
<P>
While these developments relating to infrastructure and people
may seem to be more pregnant for the future than conclusive, they
are both strongly positive. While the proof of the pudding is
in the eating, the aroma is good and we look forward to the feast.
<P>
Meanwhile, the following pages will show that the Institute's
research activities, its library, and its other functions are
ensuring that it continues to play 'a significant part in polar
studies on a world-wide basis.'

<h2><a name="sig">Sea Ice and Polar Oceanography Group</a></h2>

<b>Dr P Wadhams</b>, Reader in Polar Studies<br>
Dr N.R. Davis, E. Aldworth, M.A. Brandon, D.R. Crane, M. Huddleston,
E. Prussen, D. Sheard, M.A. Tadross, S. Wells, M. Aitchison, F.

The research work of the Group is concerned with air-sea-ice interaction
processes in polar oceans and their role in climate, and also
with the dynamics and mechanics of sea ice. Activities during
1994-95 focused on research projects in the Greenland Sea, especially
in the central gyre region where winter convection occurs; in
the Beaufort Sea with studies of ice deformation; and in the Weddell
Sea in the Antarctic.
<P>
The largest research programme with which the group is involved
is ESOP, the European Subpolar Ocean Programme. This is funded
by the Commission for the European Communities under the MAST-II
(Marine Science and Technology) Programme, and is the fourth
largest of the 70 projects in MAST-II. The research involves
21 partners in seven countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden, and the UK) and the project is co-ordinated from
SPRI by Dr Wadhams. The purpose is to study ice-ocean interaction
in the Greenland Sea with special reference to the role of sea
ice in winter convection. In the central Greenland Sea, the ice
cover of the East Greenland pack frequently develops an eastward
tongue in the latiutide range 72-76&#176;N, where the Jan Mayen
Polar Current diverts cold water to the east. The tongue is due
to local ice growth, which occurs in the form of frazil and pancake
ice owing to extreme sea states. Salt rejected from the growing
sea ice contributes to the overturning of the surface water,
leading to convective plumes that carry water down to the deep
ocean. Evidence from tracers suggests that since 1982 convection
has failed to reach the deep waters and is now terminating at
depths of 1500 m and, latterly, less than 1000 m. This is having
a profound effect on the Greenland Sea deep water, which is becoming
warmer and more saline, and may also accelerate global warming,
since the convection process acts as a sink for carbon dioxide
carried down from the surface waters.
<P>
During 1994-95 the Group was involved in the analysis and interpretation
of data from field experiments, in continued work with remote
sensing imagery of the ice cover, in modelling studies, and in
synthesis of the results with the findings of our European colleagues.
Modelling work was carried out by Matthew Huddleston (Research
Student), who is funded by a CASE studentship between NERC and
the Meteorological Office (Dr Howard Cattle). His work on ice-ocean
modelling of the Greenland Sea involves interaction with the Meteorological
Office GCM (General Circulation Model) of the atmosphere, for
which purpose a computer link was established between SPRI and
the Met Office Cray computer. Remote sensing analysis involved
interpretation of ERS-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) imagery
and SSM/I (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) passive microwave
data from the Odden ice tongue in relation to data from field
observations. In October 1994 Dr Wadhams hosted a Mid-Term Science
Symposium at SPRI, where ESOP participants presented results of
the programme so far.
<P>
During the year the same group of European partners prepared a
successful bid to continue this project for a further three years
(1996-99) under the MAST-III programme, the new phase being known
as ESOP-2. Another success for MAST-III was a joint proposal with
Finnish and Norwegian colleagues called 'Ice State,' to study
ice mechanics and their effect on icebreaker operations. Both
new contracts will start in February 1996.
<P>
In the Greenland Sea, a second MAST-II project has been carried
out by the group, a collaboration between SPRI and Dr Flavio Parmiggiani
of IMGA-CNR, Modena, again with Dr Wadhams as coordinator. The
aim of this project is to spectrally analyse SAR imagery of the
Odden region to measure the wavelengths and propagation vectors
of the dominant ocean wave species entering the frazil-pancake
ice cover from the open sea. Theory developed by Dr Wadhams predicts
that wavelength should decrease in ice (and thus refraction will
occur if waves are incident obliquely) to an extent that depends
on the thickness of the frazil-pancake layer. By examining successive
subscenes it is possible to map the thickness of the ice in Odden
and thus achieve a better insight into the likely flux of salt
into the upper ocean. Others involved in the remote sensing analysis
were Mark Tadross (Research Student) and Eileen Aldworth (Research
Associate).
<P>
The main field work undertaken by the Group during 1994-95 was
in the Weddell Sea, Antarctica, where a sea-ice research programme
was run from HMS Endurance during February 1995. The project was
designed to match surface observations of sea ice properties with
aerial photographic swathes and satellite SAR imagery, in order
to elucidate the nature of the Antarctic ice edge in late summer
and its signature on SAR. The ship sailed from Punta Arenas, with
the SPRI participants being Dr Wadhams, Huddleston, and Stephen
Wells (Research Assistant). After a call at O'Higgins Base on
the Antarctic Peninsula in order to co-ordinate data acquisition
with the German SAR receiving station there, the ship entered
the northwest Weddell Sea through Antarctic Sound and carried
out a series of experiments during a seven-day period. On each
day the ship would run into the ice along a line that was being
covered by an ERS-1 SAR orbit, using her Lynx helicopters to land
the SPRI team on a succession of ice floes. On each floe the party
took an ice core, measured snow and ice physical properties, recorded
strain and accelerations due to ocean waves, and took CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth)
profiles through the uppermost 80 m of the water column to measure
melt water effects. Meanwhile the ship was carrying out CTD profiles
at 5-10 nml intervals. As near as possible to the exact time of
the satellite overflight a helicopter would carry out a 100 nml
aerial photography flight along the line of the orbit. By matching
these datasets from three levels (satellite, air_borne, surface)
we have been able to gain new insight into the radar reponse of
Antarctic sea ice, also making the discovery that late summer
sea ice in the Weddell Sea is covered with melt pools, a phenomenon
previously thought to be confiend to the Arctic. Strain and acceleration
measurements were also carried out on two tabular icebergs. The
team disembarked at Port Stanley.
<P>
In the Beaufort Sea the Group was involved in SIMI, the Sea Ice
Mechanics Initiative of the US Office of Naval Research (ONR).
The purpose is to understand the mechanics of sea ice deformation
in the Arctic on scales ranging from tens of km down to single
cracks and individual pressure ridges, in order to be able to
improve the parameterisation of these processes in large-scale
ice-ocean models. Having taken part in a series of ice camp experiments
during 1993-94, the group spent 1994-95 on data analysis, leading
to participation in the ONR Sea Ice Mechanics and Arctic Modeling
Workshop in Anchorage, Alaska, during April 25-28 1995, in which
results were discussed and compared. 
<P>
During the year Mark Brandon (Research Student) submitted his
PhD thesis, entitled Winter surface water mass modification in
the Greenland Sea, which was approved; he moved to a research
position with British Antarctic Survey. Two Research Associates
also left the group after several years of service: David Crane
(to join Wimpey Offshore) and Eleanor Prussen (to return with
her husband to the USA). Jeremy Wilkinson joined the group as
a Research Associate from IASOS (Institute of Antarctic and Southern
Ocean Studies) in Hobart, Tasmania. <P>

<h2><a name="rsg">Remote Sensing Group</a></h2>

<b>Dr W.G. Rees</b>, Assistant Director of Research<br>
M. Williams, K.A. Teleki, G.J. Marshall, A.W. Bingham,
D.L. Feltham, A.K. Braimoh, H. Wright
<P>
The Remote Sensing Group has continued its work of developing
methods for the analysis of satellite data and of applying them
to the study of polar environments. This work has three main strands:
land ice, sea ice and icebergs, and tundra areas.
<P>
During the year, Gareth Marshall (Research Student) submitted
his PhD dissertation on the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
data from the ERS-1 satellite in glaciological research, and has
now taken up a position at the British Antarctic Survey. I-I Lin
(Research Student) was awarded the PhD degree for her thesis on
fundamental study of the use of satellite image texture in glaciology,
using both SAR and visible-wavelength imagery, and she has been
appointed to a post at Singapore National University. The results
of both of these projects are now being built upon by Andrew Bingham
(Research Student), who is investigating the potential of synergies
between different satellite data sources in determining seasonal
and long-term changes in the properties of glaciers, ice caps,
and ice sheets. A field campaign on Finsterwalderbreen in Svalbard
(summer 1995) confirmed and refined the use of SAR and Landsat
data in combination to determine the position of the snow line,
and work is now in progress to incorporate satellite-derived surface
temperature data. Also during the year, Harvey Wright (MPhil Student)
successfully applied similar methods to a study of an Alpine glacier.
<P>
Work on IPAP (Ice Pilot Applications Project) continued during
the year, with the appointment of Kristian Teleki to a research
assistantship. IPAP is an international project, funded by the
Defence Research Agency (Farnborough), to demonstrate the possibility
of producing real-time data on sea ice and iceberg distribution
and motion using satellite radar data. During the year, the Remote
Sensing Group used data provided by the Danish Meteorological
Service to confirm the accuracy of the IPAP system in detecting
sea ice and determining its concentration and motion. The system
is now being commercialised.
<P>
An associated project was also begun during the year, with the
appointment of Daniel Feltham to a UK Meteorological Office Gassiot
PhD studentship. The aim of this project is to develop a detailed
analytical and numerical understanding of the mechanisms of brine
drainage and pressure ridge formation in sea ice. Such an understanding,
at present lacking, is important in modelling the thermodynamic
effects of a sea ice cover, and will ultimately lead to improved
meteorological models. 
<P>
The Remote Sensing Group's new departure into the study of tundra
environments was maintained with the continuation of the Kol'skiy
Poluostrov project. The aim of this work, which is funded by the
UK Department of the Environment through the 'Darwin Initiative,'
is to develop methods for studying the impact of industrial pollution
on tundra and forest vegetation using satellite methods. The work
is performed in collaboration with the Geography Faculty of Moscow
State University (led by Professor A.P. Kapitsa) and the World
Conservation Monitoring Centre. During the year, the results from
the 1994 field season were worked up, and a time-series (1978-92)
of satellite images of the area surrounding the Severonikel smelter
at at Monchegorsk (Russia), processed to show changes in vegetation
health, was produced. Analysis of this time-series has shown a
number of unexpected effects, and allowed, for the first time,
the long-term effects of pollution over a wide area of tundra
to be quantified. These results were confirmed during a field
trip in summer 1995, and presented by Dr Rees at a NATO Advanced
Research Workshop in Rovaniemi, Finland. 
<P>
This work is now developing in two directions. Firstly, a geographical
extension of the methods developed on the Kol'skiy Poluostrov,
into the Taimyr Peninsula, is planned. Dr Rees, Professor Kapitsa,
and Meredith Williams (Research Assistant) performed a preliminary
investigation of sites near the nickel smelter at Norilsk during
the summer, including a 500-kilometre aerial survey. Secondly,
the Remote Sensing Group began an investigation, in collaboration
with Professor P.J. Williams (Carleton University) into the detectability
using satellite data of oil spills on permafrost terrain. A preliminary
study by Dr Rees and Ademola Braimoh (MPhil Student) showed that
the huge oil spill that occurred in 1994 at Usinsk in the Komi
Republic (Russia) could be detected and quantified in SAR images
of the area. Professor Williams and Dr Rees obtained funding from
the US Army Research Office for a pilot project to study the effects
of spilt oil on permafrost, the scope for remote detection of
the oil and its effects, and the possibility of remediation.
<P>
<h2><a name="ssg">Social Sciences and Russian Northern Studies Group</a></h2>
<P>
<b>Dr P. Vitebsky</b>, Assistant Director of Research
<br>
J. Tichotsky, P. Fryer, M. Badger, M. Whittles, B. Seligman,
D. Anderson, T. Argounova, M. Gridina, M. Curran
<P>
The group continued to expand, with an increasing number of long-term
Visiting Scholars and complex joint projects with institutions
overseas. Dr Mark Nuttall, Dr Igor Krupnik, and Dr Nikolai Vakhtin
spent time at the Institute as ESRC-funded Research Associates,
while Ben Seligman joined as a Research Student and Marion Curran
as Secretary. Having long worked with Russian scholars, the Group
welcomed its first students from Russia, Marina Gridina and Tatiana
Argounova. They completed the MPhil course and Argounova will
stay on for a PhD. She is the first Sakha (Yakut) person to study
at Cambridge.
<P>
Members of the group carried out fieldwork-based research in several
sites in Russia: Chukotka, Yakutsk, Nyeryungri, Taimyr, Verkhoyansk
Mountains, Kazym, Syktyvkar, Yamal Peninsula, Norilsk, Lake Baikal,
and Vaigach Island. In Alaska they worked in Barrow, Fairbanks,
Nome, Bethel, and Indian Valley and elsewhere in the Arctic in
Inuvik, Banks Island, Varanger Fjord, Sisimiut, Karesuando, and
Karasjok. 
<P>
A major theme has been the importance of indigenous knowledge
in making sustainable development realistic. The project on 'Environmental
change and indigenous knowledge in Siberia and Alaska,' funded
by the ESRC and directed by Dr Vitebsky, compares the uses of
indigenous knowledge by local people in each of these regions
in their response to environmental change. 
<P>
Under this project, Dr Mark Nuttall (Research Associate) studied
the conflicting uses made of indigenous knowledge by government
agencies and native groups in Alaska. He showed how an advanced
legal system and the use of databases are making this knowledge
into a commodity, which is feeding back into the educational curriculum
and affecting the perceptions of native peoples themselves.
<P>
His counterparts in Siberia, Dr Nikolai Vakhtin and Dr Igor Krupnik
(Research Associates), studied indigenous ideas about human relations
with animals and their shared use of space in Chukotka. They established
that indigenous knowledge is now becoming a matter of individual
choice as a politicial statement. However, this attempt at revival
is not backed up by a corresponding development of laws and infrastructure.
<P>
One lesson of this project is that rapid changes in the social
environment are proving as disruptive as those in the natural
environment. In the Sakha Republic (Yakutia), Dr Vitebsky and
Sally Wolfe (Phoenix Counselling Practice) studied family dynamics,
gender, and kinship in the transmission of knowledge. Ms Wolfe
studied gender relations and psychotherapeutic problems associated
with rapid social change. Dr Vitebsky studied the impact of the
skewed 'market economy' on reindeer herders and their land and
the unofficial ways in which people are regrouping themselves
and activating dormant kinship links in order to utilise resources.
Arnt-&Oslash;ve Eikeland (Visiting Scholar) studied the recent
outbreak of suicide among young Saami in Karasjok in order to
place it in a comparative circumpolar perspective.
<P>
Dr Vitebsky and John Tichotsky (Research Student) spent a month
in Barrow, Alaska, working with the North Slope Borough's Department
of Wildlife to support two indigenous organizations in Chukotka
documenting the behaviour of whales. The project also involved
Academy of Sciences institutes in Moscow and Vladivostok and has
empowered 50 Siberian indigenous leaders to intervene as experts
in resource management issues at the local and national levels.
<P>
Dr Vitebsky also worked on shamanism, the religious heart of traditional
Arctic cultures. He published The shaman, a worldwide survey that
relates the forms of shamanism in Siberia and the rest of the
Arctic to other forms throughout the world. With Dr Anatoly Alekseyev
of Yakutsk State University (Visiting Scholar), he studied the
ritual of a 107-year old Evenk shamaness in Siberia. 
<P>
Another prominent theme was ethnicity. Dr Vitebsky hosted five
delegates from the new European University of St Petersburg for
a month's study of teaching and administration methods under
the progamme on 'Establishing ethnic research in Russia,' funded
under the EU's TEMPUS-TACIS scheme. Paul Fryer (Research Student)
spent six months in the Komi Republic studying the social implications
of a new university course on Komi language, history, and culture
with which it is intended to train a new generation of administrators.
David Anderson (Research Student) completed his thesis on emerging
ideas of ethnicity among the Dolgan and Evenk of the Taimyr peninsula,
showing the progression from the local multivariate identity to
a state-induced univariate identity. Martin Whittles (Research
Student) continued his research on the Inuvialuit of Banks Island
in Canada.
<P>
A further theme has been relating local sustainable needs to economic
development on the regional level, by finding common ground between
mineral resource development and local pastoral or subsistence
activities. Dr Vitebsky and Tichotsky served as staff members
of the Sakha-American Business Centre in Yakutsk, where they facilitated
a research and training programme in reindeer meat marketing that
enabled 20 indigenous people to train in Alaska in meat processing
and marketing and encouraged the Sakha Republic to use hard-currency
diamond earnings to purchase meat processing equipment. Working
with the University of Alaska, Tichotsky also organised a programme
on oil and gas capital market training, which sent 30 Sakha participants
to Alaskan petroleum facilities to study market-oriented project
design.
<P>
Tichotsky also continued work on his PhD thesis on the regional
economy of the Sakha Republic, the chief diamond-producing region
in Russia. He visited Alaska, Chukotka, and the Sakha Republic
to collect economic data. Tatiana Argounova (MPhil Student) studied
the legal basis of the federal relationship between the Sakha
Republic (Yakutia) and the Russian Federation in the negotiation
of autonomy and sovereignty. 
<P>
A further focus of the group's work was in environmental impact
and pollution control. Marina Gridina (MPhil Student) studied
Nordic initiatives to control pollution in Norilsk and the Kol'skiy
Poluostrov. Ben Seligman (Research Student) studied the evolution
of Russian Arctic gas pipeline design, construction, and operation,
paying special attention to environmental issues, such as pipeline-permafrost
interactions and the causes and consequences of pipeline deformation
and displacement.
<P>
Members of the group also studied a number of other topics. Mark
Badger (PhD student) continued his comparison of participatory
indigenous film-making among the Koyukon in Alaska and the Khanty
in western Siberia. Johnny-Leo Ludviksen (Visiting Scholar) studied
relations between reindeer herders and the oil industry in the
Nenets Autonomous Okrug. Profesor Wendy Arundale studied historical
sites and worked on an oral life history of a Koyukon elder in
Alaska. Dr Anna Sirina, of the Regional Museum in Irkutsk, worked
as a British Academy Fellow on traditional environmental knowledge
among the peoples around Lake Baikal.

<P>
<b>Dr B. Stonehouse</b>, Senior associate
<br>
P.K. Crosbie, P. Davis, A. Dey, D. Enzenbacher, A.J. Nimon
<P>
The work of this group has included ecological and environmental
issues in both polar regions, with particular emphasis on polar
tourism.
<P>
From late November 1994 to late February 1995 a team of four occupied
the Institute's Antarctic research station on Cuverville Island,
Danco Coast, Antarctic Peninsula. As in the previous season, Kim
Crosbie (Research Student) led the party. She was accompanied
by Amanda Nimon (Research Student), Amanda Ellerback, and Sean
Stephen (Engineer, Station manager). Dr Stonehouse visited the
station several times during the season. This season's work rounded
off studies of Cuverville Island and the Errera Channel area begun
in 1992, including topographic and botanical surveys; censuses
of penguin, skua, gull, shag, and tern populations; an examination
of ways in which the area was used by visiting tour parties; and
devising optimal strategies between penguins and visitors. On
the strength of the team's findings, the draft management proposals
for Cuverville Island and the Errera Channel have been updated.
At the end of the season, the station was removed and the site
cleared.
<P>
Between November and March, Dr Stonehouse made nine cruises with
several tour operators, investigating ship operations, developing
methods of cruise reporting, and surveying landing sites. Topographical
surveys were undertaken by Kenneth Blaiklock, a veteran surveyor
with many years' Antarctic experience, who has been collating
information from British Antarctic Survey and UK Hydrographic
Office archives. In the field, he developed a method of rapid
mapping using paired GPS receivers, a plane table, and other simple
equipment, to produce maps on scales of about 1:200. The ecological
survey work was assisted by Ms Jasmine Minbashian, a graduate
ecologist from University of Washington.
<P>
Results of these surveys are being accumulated on the Institute
landing site database, which currently holds details of 180 Antarctic
sites that are used or have been used for tourist landings. Draft
management recommendations, prepared for several of the most popular
sites where flora, fauna, or historic relics are considered to
be at risk, have been circulated to selected cruise operators
for comment and amendment during the 1995-1996 season. 
<P>
Forms designed to simplify cruise reporting were field-tested
by a team of experienced cruise staff, including Peter Speak,
Greg Mortimer, and Sylvia Stevens. Thomas Bauer, a senior lecturer
in the Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management at Victoria
University for Technology, Melbourne, are intended to help in
profiling cruise passengers and predicting the market for Antarctic
tourism.
<P>
Logisitic help for this season's work was generously given by
several cruise operators, notably Quark and Noble Caledonia.
<P>
From 1 December 1994 to 28 February 1995 a display of the group's
work was mounted at the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle, Geneva, in
an exhibition entitled 'The polar regions, the Alps and climatic
change,' presented by the International Committee for Cryosphere
Ecostystems. The exhibition covered environmental issues in both
polar regions and the European Alps, with emphasis on conservation
in changing environments.
<P>
In the course of the year, three research students, Debra Enzenbacher,
Pamela Davis, and Anity Dey, completed their doctoral research
and were awarded PhD degrees.<P>

<P>
During the year, the Polar History and Humanities Group and its
corresponding members continued with a wide range of research,
dealing with polar, maritime, and exploration history and Arctic
humanities studies.
<P>
Dr Beau Riffenburgh continued his research into the relationshps
among popular culture, nationalism, nineteenth-century European
imperial expansion, and the exploration of the Arctic and Africa.
In conjunction with members of the Faculty of History at both
Cambridge and Lancaster universities, he continued research into
the role of the British popular press in the creation, dissemination,
and effect of imperial heroic exploration myths in the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries. He also furthered his research
into the life and contributions of James Gordon Bennett Jr, one
of the major sponsors of exploration in the last third of the
nineteenth century.
<P>
In addition to three books written with Senior Associate Dr Elizabeth
Cruwys - all of which were published during the year - Dr Riffenburgh
continued his work on the edited diaries and journals of the nineteenth-century
American Arctic explorer George W. Melville, to be published as The 
Great Arctic Searches.
<P>
Dr Terence Armstrong (Senior Associate) continued his work on
the history of the Northern Sea Route as part of a collaborative
project with Norwegian and Russian scholars, under the International
Northern Sea Route Programme coordinated by the Fritjof Nansen
Institute in Oslo. This sea route, if viable on a commercial scale,
could revolutionise world shipping. David Anderson (Research Student,
Social Science Group) also wrote a report for this programme.<br>
<b>Dr Armstrong died on 21 February 1996</b>
<P>
Professor Ian Whitaker (Senior Associate) continued his studies
on trade between the European Arctic and Middle East during the
Middle Ages. He also conducted research on the changing patterns
of reindeer management among Saami of Karesuando.
<P>
Dr Janet West, in collaboration with Arthur G. Credland, wrote
Scrimshaw: the art of the whaler, the first British book specifically
devoted to scrimshaw. It was published to accompany an exhibition

1994/95 has witnessed the most extensive changes to the library's
computing infrastructure since the introduction of the SPRILIB
bibliographic database in 1985. Those familiar with the Institute
in recent years will recall that in 1985 the card catalogue was
replaced by a database loaded on innovatory Muscat information
retrieval software written by Dr Martin Porter. At the time, Muscat's
principal advantage was that, through relevance feedback and term
weighting, readers could conduct quite sophisticated subject
and author searches without having to be taught the intricacies
of Boolean logic. Dr Porter has since demonstrated Muscat's considerable
power and flexibility in numerous supplementary programs, for
example, in providing the SPRILIST current awareness service,
in typesetting camera-ready copy for Polar and Glaciological Abstracts,
and in reformatting records for addition to the Arctic and Antarctic
Regions CD-ROM and to MARC format for addition to the Cambridge
University Union Catalogue. During 1994/95, not only was SPRILIB
reloaded on updated Muscat software to offer a greatly improved
user interface together with integrated acquisitions, accessions,
and cataloguing modules, but, with the installation of the Institute's
network, it, together with a range of other information services,
may now be accessed from the individual workstations of Institute
staff, students, and visitors. In 1995/96, our intention is to
make as many of these services as possible also accessible to
the international polar research community by means of the Internet.
<P>
Of the special projects reported in last year's SPRI Review, good
progress has continued to be made with the Historic Antarctic
Bibliography Project and with collaborative compilation of the
Antarctic Bibliography with the Library of Congress. With regard
to the former, the second major phase involving the processing
of J.H. Roscoe's bibliography has now been completed and a start
made on the third phase centering on the 1951-1961 retrospective
bibliography originally compiled by the Library of Congress,
fittingly with extensive collaboration from the Institute. These
two major projects form part of a comprehensive strategy at the
conclusion of which all significant Antarctic literature will
be made available through the Arctic and Antarctic Regions CD-ROM
and Internet.
<P>
Other significant developments this year have included the adoption
of the Institute as an IGBP Regional Information Centre, one of
approximately 60 libraries receiving the full collection of IGBP
reports and publications. The Librarian has also continued to
gather material for his forthcoming book 'Keyguide to information
sources on the polar and cold regions' (London: Mansell 1997).
To date, by means of desk research and questionnaires, information
has been collected on approximately 2000 research institutes,
libraries, and museums with polar interests.
<p> 

<H3>Library acquisitions and cataloguing programmes</H3>

A total of 2300 items were added to the library, including 850
books. With no significant increase in funds available for purchasing
books and periodicals, the Library is only able to continue to
acquire so many items through the generosity of those who give
either books or money. Among the latter, Mrs E.A. MacDonald, the
Sexton family, and Mr John Wright have been particularly generous
in establishing bequests to preserve the memories of Captain MacDonald,
David Sexton, and Dorothy Fetherstonhaugh, respectively, all of
whom themselves contributed greatly to the Institute when living.
A generous grant was also received from the Friends. This year's
most significant donation of books was received from Mr Alan B.
Crawford, who presented his library of books and manuscripts about
Tristan da Cunha. Other numerous gifts were received from polar
organizations and authors. The Library is particularly grateful
to the latter, many of whom make a point of sending offprints
of their articles for addition to the collection and listing in
SPRILIB and Polar and Glaciological Abstracts. By the end of the
period covered, SPRILIB held 86,360 records, with 9751 records
added during the year. Approximately 14,500 monograph records
had been added to the Cambridge University Union Catalogue.
<p>

<H3>Library staff changes</H3>

All those who have had dealings with World Data Centre C for Glaciology
will be aware of the contribution made by Ailsa Macqueen. As WDC
Manager, Mrs Macqueen was responsible for building up a collection
covering all aspects of snow and ice that is without rival anywhere.
Itinerant glaciologists will remember Ailsa for the warmth of
her welcome, her diligence, and unflagging enthusiasm. The new
Manager, Oliver Merrington, brings his own skills and ability
to the post and we are fortunate to have been able to appoint
to this post an information specialist of his information and
scientific qualifications and general interest in glaciology.

<H3>Library volunteers and work placements</H3>

The Library continued to benefit greatly from work carried out
by its growing team of volunteers. During the year, Mrs Pat Little
completed a recataloguing project in the course of which all books
in the collection published up to 1880 were added to SPRILIB.
Given the uniqueness of the Library's early holdings, this is
a major achievement. Making these records available through SPRILIB
greatly enhances their accessibility not only to those searching
SPRILIB within the Institute but also to all those with access
to the Arctic and Antarctic Regions CD-ROM on which SPRILIB is
loaded. With the departure of Ailsa Macqueen, Ron Wilbraham took
over scanning The Times for items of polar interest, in addition
to his existing duties as Honorary Map Curator. In this context,
the work of A.G.E. Jones and many others who regularly send in
cuttings identified from a wide range of British and overseas
newspapers should be acknowledged with appreciation. Without their
help, the press cuttings collection would be restricted to items
in The Times. The Library benefited greatly from the presence
of Chuen-chi Brace (National Library of Australia). During a period
of three months, Mrs Brace processed all remaining card records
for Antarctic botany before turning her attention to the seals
and sealing monographs and then to the glaciological monographs,
for all of which SPRILIB records were created before her departure.
Marcus West kindly assisted in the processing of material relating
to Spitsbergen.
<P>
Work experience placements were found for Cheryl Stark, Jacob
Potter, Alistair Phillips, Stefan Starkie, and Susanne Steckel.
Ms Steckel's ability to provide excellent German translations
for the Historic Antarctic Bibliography Project proved particularly
helpful and led to her being employed subsequently on a casual
basis in order to complete this work.

<b>Oliver Merrington</b> (from 1.3.95)
<P>
Following a review of WDC-C's activities and services, the Royal
Society halved its funding. The Society has emphasized that whilst
it considered WDC-C 'to fulfil an excellent purpose,' wider considerations
forced a decision to reduce funding, so that on the retirement
of Mrs Macqueen, the post of Manager could only be filled on a
part-time basis. The Institute was fortunate to find a well-qualified
candidate in Oliver Merrington (MSc, C Biol, MI Biol, MI InfSc)
to take up this post. Merrington was previously Head of Library
Services for a large agribusiness research site. He also brings
to the post extensive Internet and World-Wide Web experience.
Acquiring the range of specialist skills and knowledge necessary
for discharge of all of the duties of WDC-C Manager cannot be
an overnight accomplishment, but progress has been made and a
notable development has been the establishment of the Ice and
Snow database consisting of more than 25,000 glaciological records
and the first Institute facility to be made accessible over the
Internet, see: <a href="http://www.muscat.co.uk/ccdp/spri/wdccg.html">
http://www.muscat.co.uk/ccdp/spri/wdccg.html</a>.<br>
Merrington is focusing his attention particularly on identifying
the best means by which WDC-C's unmatched collection and services
may be made accessible to all glaciologists, not just to those
based in the Institute or those fortunate enough to be able to
visit Cambridge. Among the latter, WDC-C has continued to attract
a stream of visiting scientists, this year's visitors coming from
Canada, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, the Russian Federation, and
the United States.

<br>
A. Billinghurst, P. Hogg, R. Wilbraham
<P>
The services of both the museum and archives continued to cater
to a very wide variety of inquirers. This was made easier and
more efficient because revenue continued to be available to employ
an assistant, Phillipa Hogg, on a regular basis. Much volunteer
help was provided by Mr Tony Billinghurst with the photographs
and Mr Ron Wilbraham with archival and museum work.
<P>
The occasion of the centenary of the International Geographical
Congress, which adopted the resolution initiating a major concentration
on Antarctic exploration, was commemorated by a colloquium in
Sandefjord, Norway. This provided another opportunity to reinforce
links with Norwegian activities, especially as the new Director
of the South Georgia Whaling Museum was also able to attend. The
occasion was also that of founding of an 'Antarktisk Forum' with
the object of centralising information held privately by several
families descendent from those involved in the exploration at
the beginning of this century. Copies of certain material held
at the Institute have been provided to Norwegian organizations,
and a list of archives held there is in preparation. Requests
to lecture aboard passenger vessels were again accepted, which,
as well as maintaining practical contact with the polar regions,
allowed direct experience of the changing state of affairs in
the Arctic.
<P>
The number of readers requesting documents and callers to see
artifacts was approximately the same as in the previous year.
Visitors came from many associated institutes, including representatives
from the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage, Terres Australes et Antarctiques
Fran&ccedil;aise (for Iles Kerguelen historical material), Estonian
Academy of Sciences, Russian Institute of Geography, and Roald
Amundsens Minne. Questions in correspondence continued to be voluminous,
although a proportion of inquirers were advised to visit to conduct
their own research.

<H3>Archives</H3>

A somewhat greater number of readers were accommodated than during
the previous year and, even with additional staff, the importance
of the booking system became apparent. A small increase in general
inquiries also occurred and the customary information requests
from Crown Agents and various others continued.
<P>
John B&eacute;chervaise's biography of John Rymill was published
in the spring, and the work by Admiral James Ross on the two polar
Rosses (John and James Clarke), based to a great extent on material
held by the Institute, appeared shortly afterwards. The regular
work in maintaining the Antarctic chronology also continued (it
now exceeds 3800 entries).
<P>
Several important acquisitions were made during this year, including
the research collections of Mr Alan Crawford, a most comprehensive
set of material about Tristan da Cunha, Gough Island, Bouvet&oslash;ya,
the Prince Edward Islands, and other parts of this region. These
papers came in excellent order, which allowed them to be catalogued
quickly. Rev Gavin White kindly gave his research papers concerning
the Canadian Arctic, which were also incorporated quite rapidly.
Gifts of original and copied manuscripts were received from several
other sources, which gave constant reminders of the generosity
of benefactors and their consideration of the Institute.
<P>
For many years papers from the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition
have been received from several sources. A review of these confirmed
that the principal set was correct and provided a reasonably complete
set of duplicates. These, with the consent of Sir Vivian Fuchs,
were offered to the New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme,
which is maintaining one of the original 'Scott Base' huts on
Ross Island, from where the New Zealand contingent of the expedition
worked. It is intended that these papers make their way to the
island to be part of the historical information available there.
<P>
The monitoring of environmental conditions and conservation work
continued. A new supplier of acid-free folders, suitable for the
document cabinets, was found. Contributions from the Friends of
SPRI for archival conservation were particularly useful.
<p>

<H3>Museum</H3>

Visitor numbers were slightly greater, particularly because of
the new 'Science at the Poles' exhibition maintained in cooperation
with the British Antarctic Survey. This was improved with large
colour prints generously provided by the Survey. The publication
of Admiral Ross' book was a timely excuse for a display on 'The
Polar Rosses.' This exhibited a range of published and manuscript
works, including a flag and a pennant that flew over the Arctic
and the Antarctic approximately 150 years ago. A small exhibition
to show some of the history of Scott Polar Research Institute
was arranged prior to the seventy-fifth anniversary commemorations.
<P>
Several visiting groups were again accommodated and a small increase
in booked school parties occurred. Attention was drawn to the
state of Edward Bransfield's grave in Brighton and 'redevelopment'
of the cemetery. Liaison with the Royal Commission on Historical
Monuments may help its preservation. The largest gift received,
from a physical aspect, was a portrait of the Arctic explorer
Frederick Jackson, given by his regiment. He appears in polar
clothing; the portrait awaits cleaning and display in a Franz-Josef
Land exhibition. Plates of some of the Institute's scrimshaw were
made available for a comprehensive work on the subject by Dr Janet
West, prepared in cooperation with the Hull Maritime Museum.
<P>
Useful revenue was received from the public donation box, but
there was one unfortunate occurrence. A large plate window was
smashed by thieves and the box robbed. Much stronger glass and
other precautions are now present. As for many years previously,
the contribution from several of the Friends of the Institute
in invigilating the museum and assisting with sales was invaluable,
especially during the busy summer and tourist season.
<p>

<H1><a name="polpubl">Polar Publications</a></H1>

Four issues of Polar Record were published, and the journal continued
its development under the editor, <b>Dr Beau Riffenburgh</b>, as an internationally
refereed journal of polar research for the science, social sciences,
and humanities. The April 1995 issue was a special double issue
dedicated to the proceedings of the 'Third circumpolar symposium
on remote sensing of Arctic environments,' which was held in Fairbanks,
Alaska, 16-20 May 1994. For the first time, this issue carried
extensive colour photography. The editor was greatly assisted
in the production of Polar Record by Dr Elizabeth Cruwys, Mrs
Ailsa Macqueen, Dr Peter Clarkson, and Stephen Wells.<br>
A long-awaited book, <i>Polar pundit: reminiscences about Brian Birley
Roberts</i>, was published in April 1995 after extensive efforts by
Mr H.G.R. King, Mrs Ann Savours, and the editor.

<h1><a name="scar">Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research</a></h1>

The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) of the International
Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) is housed within the Institute.
<b>Dr P.D. Clarkson</b> and Mrs P. Richmond continued as Executive Secretary
and Secretary, respectively, throughout the year.
<P>
In April 1995, Dr Clarkson represented SCAR at a workshop on 'Air
transport networks in Antarctica,' and presented a paper on Air
transport needs for science in Antarctica.' The workshop was organised
by the Standing Committee on Antarctic Logistics and Operations
(SCALOP) of the Council of Managers of National Antarctic Programmes
(COMNAP) in Washington, DC.
<P>
In May 1995, SCAR was represented at the XIXth Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meeting (XIX ATCM) in Seoul, North Korea, by Professor
A.C. Rocha-Campos, Dr D.W.H. Walton, and Dr Clarkson. The meeting
welcomed the offer made by SCAR and the COMNAP to hold two workshops
on the subject of environmental monitoring in the Antarctic. The
Executive Secretary attended and serviced the first of these workshops
held in Oslo, Norway, during October 1995.
<P>
Also during May 1995, Dr Clarkson serviced a workshop on Vostok
Lake, hosted by the Scott Polar Research Institute on behalf of
the French, Russian, and United States National Committees for
SCAR.
<P>
The SCAR Group of Specialists on Environmental Affairs and Conservation
held its meeting (GOSEAC VII) at the New Zealand Antarctic Programme
headquarters in Christchurch, New Zealand, during June 1995. Dr
Clarkson took part in and serviced the meeting.
<P>
The Executive Secretary also serviced the meeting of the SCAR
Executive Committee in Siena, Italy, during September 1995. A
major item for the meeting was the redrafting of the SCAR Constitution
and Rules of Procedure.
<P>
Four issues of <i>SCAR Bulletin</i> (nos 115-118) were published within
Polar Record and as separates during the year with the assistance
of Polar Publications.
<P>
SCAR continues its principal functions to initiate, promote, and
coordinate scientific research in the Antarctic, and also provides
scientific advice to the Antarctic Treaty System.
<P>

<h1><a name="igs">International Glaciological Society</a></h1>

<b>Dr Simon Ommanney</b>, Secretary General
<P>
The Society continued its service to the glaciological community,
its publishing activities, and the organization of symposia around
the world from its headquarters within the Scott Polar Research
Institute. Access to its office is now possible through the Internet
on the following email address: 
(<a href="mailto:100751.1667@compuserve.com">100751.1667@compuserve.com</a>).
<P>
In 1995 the Society published three issues of the <i>Journal of Glaciology</i>
and three issues of <i>ICE, the News Bulletin of the International
Glaciological Society</i>. Douglas MacAyeal (University of Chicago)
continued as chief editor of the Journal, with copy editing done
by Ray Adie and Ken Moxham. The proceedings of the 'International
symposium on the role of the cryosphere in global change' (Columbus,
Ohio, 1994) were published in July as Annals of Glaciology 21.
All publications are available from the IGS office.
<P>
The 'International symposium on glacier erosion and sedimentation'
was held in Reykjavik, Iceland, in August 1995. The overall organization
was done by the Secretary General, with local arrangements though
a Icelandic committee headed by Helgi Bjornsson. The proceedings
will be published as Annals of Glaciology 22, edited by David
Collins (University of Manchester).
<P>
The IGS is collaborating with the European Science Foundation
in publishing the proceedings of the 'EISMINT international symposium
on ice sheet modelling,' held in Chamonix, France, in September
1995. These are scheduled to be published as Annals of Glaciology
23, and will be edited by Kolumban Hutter (Technische Hochschule
Darmstadt).
<P>
Planning for future symposia continued. For 1996, the IGS is organizing
the 'International symposium on representation of the cryosphere
in climate and hydrological models,' in Victoria, Canada, from
12-15 August. It is a co-sponsor of a workshop on 'Changing glaciers:
revising themes and field sites of classical glaciology,' to be
held in Fjaerland, Norway from 24-26 June, and will publish the
proceedings of this meeting in the Annals of Glaciology. The IGS
is also co-sponsor of the 'IXth international symposium on the
physics and chemistry of ice,' being held at Dartmouth College,
Hanover, New Hampshire, 27-31 August.
<P>
In 1997 the IGS is organizing an 'International symposium on
snow and avalanches' in Chamonix, France, 25-29 May, and one on
'Antarctica and global change,' in collaboration with the Antarctic
CRC in Hobart, Tasmania, 14-18 July. For 1998 the Society has
accepted an invitation to meet in Sweden to discuss the interaction
between ice sheets and landscapes. 
<P>
The Secretary General attended the one-hundredth anniversary meeting
of the Comitato Glaciologico Italiano, in Torino and presented
a paper on 100 years of glacier observations in Canada, which
will be published in Geografica Fisica e Dinamica Quaternaria.
