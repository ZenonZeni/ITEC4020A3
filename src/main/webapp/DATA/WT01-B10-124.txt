<A  NAME="KAUAI"</A><H1>KAUAI: 
<BR>
The Healing, Garden Island</H1>
<H3>by Joan Levy</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<P><FONT SIZE=4>
Kaui is calling you. Can you hear her? A balmy, tropical island with breathtaking majestic beauty, peace and quiet. A healing place. To come to Kauai is to be nourished, to be deeply touched by an elemental healing energy that long flowered into powerful ancient Hawaiian healing traditions and the precious spirit of Aloha.</P>

<P>Over time, Kauai has called many practitioners to her shores to contribute their healing practices and gifts. <B>The Association for Healing Arts Practitioners</B> was formed to provide healing services, free information and referral. Whether it be a gentle, relaxing touch or a deep and penetrating therapeutic massage, skilled massage therapists, Native Hawaiian lomi lomi workers and bodyworkers can ease tired, sore muscles after a hike to the top of a mountain or down to the depth of a hidden waterfall. They can assist recovery from injury, relieve chronic pain, and release long-stored tension from a stressful life. </P>

<P>Chiropractors, acupuncturists, herbalists, nutritionists, kinesiologists, aroma therapists and colon therapists abound to support physical alignment, attunement and healing for the body. Mind/body psychotherapists are there to address your mental, emotional, physical and spiritual needs. Psychics, astrologers, Reiki, spiritual healing, advanced energy techniques and channels are also available to support you metaphysically. All these healers' skillful work is empowered by the healing energy of the land. You will also find various styles of yoga, tai chi, aikido, meditation, and breath therapy to help calm, center and balance you. Something for everyone!</P>

<P>Kauai invites you to come and re-establish physical, mental, emotional and spiritual balance in your life. With lasting effects that can enhance your whole life as well as your vacation, Kauai's Association for Healing Arts Practitioners can meet your healing needs.</P>

<P><B>LODGING ON KAUAI:</B>
<BR>
All three of the places listed here are affiliated with Kauai's Association for Healing Arts Practitioners, and can provide massage and other healing services on the premises, plus information and referrals for various other therapies.</P>

<P>Conveniently situated half-way between Kauai's Na Pali Coast and Waimea Canyon, <B>Keapana Center</B> stands on 3 acres of rolling hills overlooking the ocean and mountains. It's 5 minutes from Kapaa Village and Kealia Beach, a long, white sandy crescent safe for swimming and body serfing. The Center's grounds provide ample space for individual solitude and retreat. Guests are encouraged to lounge on rattan sofas, swing in the hammock or soak in the spacious jacuzzi overlooking magnficent mountain vistas. Keapana Center provides the perfect starting point for island-wide exploration. </P>

<P><B>Kai Mana</B>, the beautiful home of author Shakti Gawain, is set on a cliff surrounded by a panorama of ocean and mountains. Wake up to a leisurely breakfast and wind down with a soak in their hot tub on the spacious lanai. A cliffside trail leads to one of the most beautiful and secluded beaches in Hawaii. Counseling sessions with the best selling author are available when she is on the island.</P>

<P>Round out your stay on Kauai at <B>Tassa Hanalei</B>, a bed & breakfast retreat modeled after a Zen Buddhist center, and situated deep in the foothills of Hanalei. You will know you are getting near when you can see the silhouette of Bali Hai in the distance, and recognize the beaches where<I> South Pacific</I> was filmed. A communal hot tub and cold plunge are available for guests, as well as a swimming area in the waist-deep Wainiha River. At their Healing Temple you can arrange for various styles of massage and bodywork.</P>

<A  NAME="AHH, MEXICO!"</A>
<H1>AHH, MEXICO!
<BR>
A Guide to Little-Known Getaways
<BR> on Mexico's Tropical West Coast</H1>
<H3>by Allan Hardman</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<FONT SIZE=4>

<P>Ahh, Mexico. Land of romance and adventure . . . Land of luxurious beaches and tropical breezes . . . of wonderfully warm people and rich traditions. Oh, but wait! Maybe Mexico makes you think of malaria and Monteczuma's revenge, or revolutions and bandidos, and of phones that never work. Well, you might be partly right, but let me share with you some of the Mexico that I love. If you know Mexico, you might know some of these places, and if you have never been, well, let me encourage you.</P>

<P><B>PUERTO VALLARTA</B>
<BR>
"Vallarta" is probably the easiest gateway to the tropical Pacific Coast of Mexico, and one of the best destinations for a first trip. You can fly direct from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta in 3 1/2 hours. When you step out of the plane, juicy tropical air embraces you like you wish your lover did. Exquisite. Mariachi music drifts to you from somewhere. Palm trees sway in the breeze. You are in a different world.</P>

<P>Puerto Vallarta still has its cobblestone Mexican charm and small town warmth (along with its big American hotels and parasailing on the beach if you must), and English is spoken in most places. Stay in the old part of town<I> (El Centro)</I> and avoid the hotel strip. Hotel Posada Roger is clean and comfortable and costs under $20 a night. In addition to its beaches, there are lots of shops with beautiful silver jewelry and endless possibilities for shopping at reasonable prices, and a wonderful <I>malecon</I> (Mexican boardwalk) for strolling in the evening.</P>

<P>For do-ers, Vallarta offers activities like horseback rides to waterfalls, snorkeling, jeep tours, boat trips to secluded coves and to  nearby Yelapa, the roadless, phoneless hideout of many an American. The food in Vallarta is great. You'll find everything from street vendor mystery meat tacos to nice restaurants serving some of the finest seafood you may ever eat.</P>

<P><B>CHACALA & MAR DE JADE</B>
<BR>
If you are a seasoned traveler that speaks some Spanish, or a willing adventurer, grab a bus going north from Puerto Vallarta and get off after about 1.5 hours in Las Varas. Take a cheap taxi for an amazing half hour ride to Chacala and Mar de Jade. Chacala is a small fishing village on the sweetest little cove and beach you ever saw.</P>

<P><B>Mar de Jade</B> (Sea of Jade) is a modest American/Mexican project, part hotel and part social project. You can stay as a tourist, as Spanish student, do work exchange, hold your workshop there, be a doctor volunteer in their free medical clinic in Las Varas, or any combination thereof. Tourist prices are about $45 per day, including 3 great meals served on a patio overlooking the beach, and also including all the beautiful beach and tanning sun you could possibly want. It's a place to get very involved, or a place to go and be, to just hide out.</P>

<P><B>SANTA CRUZ</B>
<BR>
For the more adventurous, in Las Varas change buses for the rattling chicken-on-board ride up the beautiful jungle coast road to Santa Cruz, Nayarit (about 90 minutes, depending). The small village of Santa Cruz is set comfortably behind it's rocky beach, surrounded by tropical mountains covered with rambling jungle and banana plants. It is pure Mexico: cobblestone and adobe, and some of the friendliest people I have ever known.</P> 

<P>Except for the very comfortable motel Brisas Marina, which sprang up recently like a mushroom, accommodations are limited to rustic thatched <I>palapas</I>, or simple bare rooms. Restaurants are vague, mostly limited to tacos or ceviche on a card table, curbside (depending on the season). There's always fresh fruit, good beans and tortillas, and fresh fish and shrimp. (Note: there is no parasailing available in Santa Cruz!)</P>

<P><B>BARRA DE NAVIDAD</B>
<BR>
One more possibility worth suggesting for your perfect beach holiday is Barra de Navidad. I would recommend Barra for beginners or for seasoned travelers. (I've been sworn to secrecy about Barra by the aficionados that already love it, so keep this to yourself!)</P>

<P>You fly direct to Manzanillo (south of Puerto Vallarta) and take the Volkswagen shuttle bus north to Barra. Another quiet cobblestone village, this one is big enough to have several pleasant, low-key hotels and some very good restaurants. Some English is spoken. There is a nice beach for swimming and sunning, and a huge lagoon with little restaurants standing on stilts over the water. Romantic, warm and luscious!</P>

<P><B>ABOUT WEATHER, MONEY, ETC.</B>
<BR>
There are two seasons in coastal Mexico: wonderfully warm and very hot. Winter in the U.S. is a perfect time there (late October to early April). Summer in the U.S. is really summer there: very hot plus rain and mosquitoes. Consider visiting higher elevations in the summer, such as <B>Guadalajara</B> and its circle of colonial cities, or <B>Oaxaca</B>.</P>

<P>Mexico's reputation for being a cheap vacation place is still true, although it is no longer nearly free, like it once was. With the devaluation of the peso, the value of the tourist dollar went up considerably. Hurry, go before prices go up again. It's simple and hassle-free to travel to and in Mexico. Of course, a little Spanish helps, but take a phrase book and an open heart, and you'll find that your needs will be met, and then some.</P>

<A  NAME="JOURNEY"</A>
<H1>JOURNEY:
<BR>
A Cycle of Sacred Time</H1>
<H3>by Jan Boddie, Ph.D. & Marystella Church, B.A.</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<FONT SIZE=4>
<P>In the English language we sometimes interchange the words journey, trip and travel. There is, however, a quantum difference between taking a trip and being on a journey. We've all done some traveling, perhaps at times alone and at other times with others. Be it a commute to work, a weekend getaway, or a vacation in Hawaii, it's a common tradition in many countries to take trips. To go abroad and play at being a tourist is a familiar way to travel for many of us.</P>

<P>Yet being on a journey is quite different from traveling or being on a trip. It's as different as taking a picture of the ocean is from jumping in and experiencing it! For starters, traveling can be exhausting because there is so much to figure out: where to stay; how to find the cathedral or whatever you came to visit; fussing about the clothes you did or did not bring.</P>

<P>Journeying probes deeper than these thoughts that consume us. Being on a journey is going beyond what is on our mind and connecting with what is in it. Imagine the difference: You are on a tour of the Acropolis in Athens, overwhelmed with the magnificence of history and art and natural beauty, while also being concerned about time and your schedule for the rest of the day. Now imagine being at the Acropolis and following your inclination to stop on Mars hill where Socrates sat with his students, and taking the time to engage in a deep and meaningful dialogue with like-spirited companions.</P>

<P>There's a difference between keeping busy with seeing sights and taking pictures, and actually being present with what you are experiencing. Although each requires form and purpose, travel gives a focus to the doing-ness, while journey is balanced with actual being-ness. Journey goes beyond the restraints of physical time and space. Journey feeds the soul.</P>

<P>The word "travel" comes from "travail," which originally meant an instrument of torture, while "journey" is rooted in the name of the Goddess Diana and is related to both "deity" and "Day." One might loosely translate this as meaning "a cycle of holy time." In other words, to journey is to make a pilgrimage. People used to make pilgrimages to foreign and holy places, which were symbolic for reconnecting with the hidden and holy places within themselves.</P>

<P>But physical travel is not a prerequisite for journeying. We journey every night in our dreams, for example, during which a rich symbolism helps us to remember and even heal aspects of ourselves that have been buried below waking consciousness. We journey during guided meditations; even daydreaming is a form of journey.</P>

<P>When we travel, we literally carry baggage. Typically, we also carry the symbolic baggage of expectations and belief systems, of judgments and assumptions. In fact, we set ourselves up for disappointment and frustration by closing ourselves off from the adventure of discovery. It's impossible to be present in the unfoldment of each new moment when we've locked ourselves into the future by having a fixed agenda.</P>

<P>Embarking on a journey, be it in the dream world or the physical world, is like stepping out of the grid lines that limit our concept of reality. Patterns in daily life vanish as we step into the spaces between the dots, into the "places" where possibility and probability live.</P>

<P>When we open ourselves to experiences that are not dictated by logic and reason, and that are not structured by belief and judgment, we become aligned with what was always before us and what was always within us. This is a journey or pilgrimage. It is a movement toward wholeness or holiness, a cycle of time for entering the sacred.</P>

<P>Connecting with more of who we really are (that is, experiencing more of our innate wholeness) is also an opening for connecting more fully with others and with the Earth. When we journey, we waken to the knowing of our interconnectedness.</P>

<P>True journey, then, cannot happen in isolation. It is a contradiction in terms to set ourselves apart (whether out of fear or arrogance or unconscious beliefs) when the essence of journey is inter-relatedness. By remaining connected to ourselves, others and the Earth, our daily travels, our trips to foreign places, our dreams and flights of imagination are transformed into wondrous cycles of sacred time.</P>

<P>Although journey can be experienced in as many forms as there are personalities on this planet, we are all on the same journey. This is the new paradigm struggling to be birthed: a collective realization of our inter-relatedness in sacred time, and a remembering of our connection to things we do not yet know.</P>

<A  NAME="Sandy Bar"</A>
<H1>Sandy Bar Ranch,
On The Wild Klamath River</H1>
<H3>by Mark Dupont</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<FONT SIZE=4>

<P></P>Each Fall anglers and hikers along the Klamath River and its tributaries can witness one of nature's most exhilarating events--the return of the salmon from the ocean. The salmon and steelhead migration is a natural phenomenon on a par with the buffalo of the great plains--a massive movement of a species that once provided sustenance, fueled myth and inspired awe. Each year the great fish are called from the expanse of the Pacific to an arduous journey of hundreds of miles to the high mountain streams of their origin.
<P></P>Sandy Bar Ranch is located on the Klamath River, the sixth largest watershed in the Pacific Northwest. The river carries water originating high in the snow-capped Cascades past our cabins, and brings schools of migrating salmon and steelhead up from the Pacific to spawn in its tributaries. On any given day one can see osprey, river otters, bald eagles, deer, fox, great blue heron or even bear along its banks. 
<P></P>As our familiarity with the river has expanded beyond the short stretch of it that we call home, we have learned that our lives are intimately connected with its entire length.	
<P></P>Located in the Karuk Homelands, our small rural community of Orleans, CA encompasses a diverse community of Native Americans, organic farmers, Forest Service personnel, artisans and local business people. Sandy Bar Ranch serves as a gateway to the trails and rivers of the surrounding Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains, and as an educational facility offering workshops on a variety of topics. 
<P></P>On the Ranch you'll find an organic garden, a fruit tree nursery and home crafts. We are a collective enterprise dedicated to stewardship of the land and the sustainable management of natural resources held in trust for future generations.	
<P></P>Salmon and steelhead have always played a primary role in life along the Klamath River. For centuries Native Americans have relied on the salmon for sustenance, and still fish along the banks of the Klamath with traditional dip nets. Old-timers on the river tell of times when the salmon runs were so dense, a person could walk across the river on the backs of the great fish. Because the Klamath River is sparsely populated and has no major industries along its banks, it has long been recognized for its importance as an adromous fish habitat.	 <P></P>Encompassing over 10 million acres, the Klamath River watershed is the largest between the Columbia and the Sacramento Rivers. It is home to four Native American tribes, and supports more than one third of the commercial ocean fish catch between Fort Bragg, California and Coos Bay, Oregon.	
<P></P>Salmon and steelhead are indicator species. Because their life cycle encompasses so much of the watershed, from small tributaries all the way to the ocean, their presence and the stability of their numbers are a barometer which tells us about the health of our forests and rivers. The story being told now is an alarming one. We are on the brink of losing these fish due to a number of factors, including habitat destruction and low river flows.
<P></P>But despite the pressures and challenges, the Klamath remains one of the wildest rivers in the Pacific Northwest. In the fall of 1995 we witnessed the salmon return in record numbers. The sight of the mighty fish leaping through white water is truly awe-inspiring. Yet we are reminded by the Karuk Elders that the fish are but a fraction of their former numbers. 
<P></P>Pat Higgins, a Fisheries Scientist who worked on the Long Range Restoration Plan for the Klamath River and has led tours at Sandy Bar Ranch, states that the Klamath holds the most promise of any of the Pacific Northwest rivers for preservation and restoration of the salmon and steelhead. 
<P></P>We encourage you to visit this spectacular region. It is important to experience the salmon, the forests and wild rivers for yourself. The wilderness provides peace, adventure and inspiration for stewardship. We at Sandy Bar Ranch can connect you with conservation groups working to protect the Klamath region. We can also point you in the direction of wilderness trails,  arrange whitewater rafting trips, and organize EcoTours (for groups of ten or more).	
<P></P>Those of us concerned about our rivers and forests must make our voices heard. The salmon will continue to be called back from the oceans to spawn in the streams of their birth; it is up to us to make sure that the waters run clean for them. If we participate in shaping the future of our public lands and waters, then we can preserve the natural beauty that we now enjoy for generations to come. And maybe some day our grandchildren will walk across the river on the backs of salmon.

<A  NAME="Osmosis"</A>
<H1>Japanese Enzyme Bath:<BR>
Metabolic Rejuvenation
</H1>
<H3>by Michael Stusser</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<FONT SIZE=4>
<P></P>Ten years ago the Japanese Enzyme Bath was unknown in the United States. Now over 50,000 people have experienced this unique heat treatment, and many more have heard about it.
<P></P>What is it about the enzyme bath that draws so many people to use it? Most people say they feel transformed by the enzyme bath. After just one treatment bathers feel significantly renewed, their skin softened, smoothed and glowing with warmth. They report a sensation of profound relaxation and rejuvenation. It is especially soothing for the digestive and nervous system, excellent for detoxification, and highly beneficial for aches and pains, stress and fatigue. 
<P></P>Why is this?	 The enzyme bath works on the metabolic system by affecting enzyme activity throughout the body. The action of the enzyme bath imitates much of the work that is constantly being performed by the internal organs to produce both heat and enzyme activity inside the body. When the body is immersed in this bio-active medium, circulation and metabolism are stimulated from outside, giving a boost to the internal organs which usually perform these functions on their own. This is part of the reason the bath is both relaxing and energizing at the same time!	
<P></P>The heat in the enzyme bath is produced biologically by fermentation, nature's purification process, which requires the presence of over 600 active enzymes. The largest organ of the body, the skin, comes in direct contact with intense enzyme activity in the enzyme bath. The bath, in addition to heat, produces its own electro-chemical environment. There are over 3,000 different enzymes in every cell of living tissue. This combination of heat and energy influences the enzymes in your body in many ways.
<P></P>The enzyme bath works to break down body wastes in the subcutaneous layer of the skin. The surface of your skin, your pores, and even the cells themselves are thoroughly cleansed. By enhancing enzyme function in your body, the bath improves digestion and cleansing organ function, increases the exchange of oxygen from the lungs into the bloodstream, and balances the energy in the nervous system. 
<P></P>This treatment is not recommended for individuals with high blood pressure, women during pregnancy or following the consumption of alcoholic beverages. It is suggested for people seeking a powerful energetic shift in one session, and especially advisable for detoxification (a great way to end a fast), nervousness or stress, aches, pains and low back discomfort, or if you simply want to feel fantastic.	
<P></P>Osmosis Enzyme Bath and Massage in Freestone, California is the first and only enzyme bath in the USA. Ideally situated for the ultimate getaway, Osmosis is located in one of the most scenic valleys in Northern California. The facility has been optimized to create a complete healing sanctuary. 
<P></P>In addition to the bath, guests are served an enzyme tea in an exquisite Japanese garden upon their arrival. They are treated to personalized service and privacy throughout their visit, and have the option of receiving a 75-minute massage following their bath  from one of many exceptionally gifted bodyworkers. Massage is available either indoors or in the new pavilions in the outdoor garden sanctuary.	
<P></P>Michael Stusser came upon the Enzyme Bath while living in Japan over 10 years ago. The bath helped his sciatica and provided a personal transformation. He was so impressed with the overall effect of the enzyme treatment that he made it his mission to bring it back to America. He started the Osmosis Enzyme Bath in 1985.
