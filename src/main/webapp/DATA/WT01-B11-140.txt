<H2>Recognizing the Symptoms of Raccoon Rabies</H2>
</CENTER>

<B>What is raccoon rabies?</B><P>
	
It is a strain of rabies spread primarily by raccoons.<P>

<B>At present, raccoon rabies is not found in Ontario.</B><P>

Raccoon rabies, like all strains of rabies, is a viral disease carried in an animal's saliva.  Humans and other animals can be infected by a rabid animal through a cut or scratch, or through contact with the moist tissues of the mouth, nose or eyes.<P>

<B>What are the symptoms of rabies?</B><P>

Rabies can manifest itself as "dumb" or "furious" rabies.<P>

In dumb rabies:
<UL>
<LI>some animals may become depressed and retreat to isolated places
<LI>wild animals, especially skunks, may lose their fear of humans
<LI>animals may show signs of paralysis such as abnormal facial expressions, drooping head, sagging jaw, or paralyzed hind limbs
</UL>
In furious rabies:
<UL>
<LI>animals may show extreme excitement and aggression
<LI>animals may gnaw and bite their own limbs
<LI>animals may attack stationary things or other animals
<LI>bouts of furious rabies usually alternate with periods of depression
</UL>



<B>How long does it take for an animal to get rabies after it is infected?</B><P>

The time between exposure to the virus and the onset of symptoms can range from about two weeks to many months.<P>

<B>Can animals have rabies without showing any symptoms?</B><P>

Yes.  The rabies virus can be found in animal saliva days before any obvious symptoms develop.  However, all animals that have the virus will develop symptoms and eventually die of the disease.<P>
