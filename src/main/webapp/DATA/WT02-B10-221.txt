In 1994, we reaffirmed the threefold mission of the Psychiatric Institute: state-of-the-art research, outstanding clinical service, and excellent teaching. Although PI may be best known internationally for its research accomplishments, we continued to stress that all of our efforts ultimately serve one goal: to find and provide the best possible therapies for people suffering with mental illness.

  Construction of PI's new building has remained very close to schedule, thanks to the continued efforts of Dr. Oldham, Mr. Papp, and Ms. Corn. They have been assisted in this very complicated endeavor by many people, including Mr. Peter Reynolds and Mr. Hal Seligson. At every step of the way many things could easily have derailed this construction; each time these people have worked very hard to keep things on track. We now anticipate opening the building in slightly more than two years.

In l994, Dr. David Strauss filled in ably as Acting Clinical Director after Dr. Russakoff's departure. An important new committee was established, the Quality Improvement (QI) Council, chaired by Ms. Corn. The QI Council is charged with the responsibility of developing and monitoring an ongoing process of continuous quality improvement at Psychiatric Institute. Many QI projects have already been initiated, and each has involved staff from many disciplines. It is the aim of the QI Council and of the QI Cabinet that all employees at Psychiatric Institute play a major and ongoing role in identifying areas for improvement, helping to implement changes, and assessing the progress we are making.

In 1994, after many years of dedicated service to PI, Mr. Valerio Nuccitelli retired as director of our pharmacy. We were fortunate to have Mr. Stephen McMillan join us as the new pharmacy director. He has already made an outstanding contribution to the Institute.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The multidisciplinary approach is key to our clinical efforts. Under the direction of the President of the Medical Staff Organization, Dr. Ewald Horwath, we have seen our medical staff take a larger role in assuring the quality of our clinical care. Every discipline is involved including Nursing, directed by Ms. Marcia Michaelson, Social Work, directed by Ms. Jane Waters, Occupational Therapy, directed by Ms. Barbara Bouley, Recreational Therapy, directed by Mr. Matt Gold, and Pharmacy, directed by Mr. Stephen McMillan. Mr. Gold also directs our very important volunteer program and made important steps this year to strengthen it.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All of these disciplines work directly with our inpatient and outpatient services. Dr. Evelyn Attia led the Clinical Psychopharmacology service on PI7 which specialized in research involving patients with depression or eating disorders. The General Clinical Research Service, led by Dr. Lyle Rosnick on PI5, continued to hospitalize patients enrolled in several research protocols, including adolescents with suicidal behavior, patients needing ECT, and adults with suicidal behavior. In addition, patients with severe character disorders were also admitted to PI5. The Schizophrenia Research Unit, on PI4, had new leadership; Dr. Scott Clark stepped in to assume many of the unit chief responsibilities with the appointment of Dr. Strauss to the position of Clinical Director. Dr. Clark immediately began working to boost the census of PI4 and to solidify its relationship with its associated unit, the Schizophrenia Research Unit at Creedmoor Psychiatric Center. The latter came under the direction of Dr. Zafir Sharif in 1994. These two units form the foundation of the Developing Clinical Research Center that was funded in August 1994, by the National Institute of Mental Health.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All of our research outpatient clinics continued to provide both outstanding care and important training sites in 1994. Of particular note was the funding by NIMH of a Hispanic Treatment Program, directed by Dr. Michael Liebowitz. This development makes it increasingly possible for us to be responsive to our community.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Washington Heights Community Service continued to be a model care-provider for patients with serious mental illness. Operating both an inpatient unit (on PI6, directed by Dr. Ewald Horwath) and two outpatient clinics (the Audubon Clinic, directed by Dr. Pellegrino Sarti, and the Inwood Clinic, directed by Dr. Siobhan Coomaraswamy), the Washington Heights Community Service continues to reflect the vision and dedication of its director, Dr. Francine Cournos.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Our educational programs continue to be national resources. The residency education program, directed by Dr. Ronald Rieder, with assistance from Dr. Lisa Mellman, once again maneuvered successfully through the "Match," so that PI's residents continue to be among the best of any program in the United States. Dr. Rieder also continued to direct two NIMH-funded research fellowship programs. Medical students also continued to rate our educational programs very highly, thanks to the direction of Dr. Eric Marcus with assistance from Dr. Janice Cutler. We also continued major training programs in social work, psychology, nursing, and occupational and recreational therapy. For new and continuing employees we maintain many levels of educational programs, directed by Dr. Sandra Rosenblum.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
All of this work must take place in an environment that is safe and functions optimally. Here we recognize the efforts of Mr. Willie Herriott and our Safety Department and of Mr. Harold Jones and our Housekeeping Department. Resources are preciously few for these two departments, yet they continue to provide us with a very high level of service, for which all employees at PI are grateful.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
PI is only one year away from celebrating its 100th birthday, and it continues to provide a unique environment for the highest quality patient care, research, and education. This is because no matter how difficult things become, we have a group of clinicians, researchers, and support staff who are second to none, and who are dedicated to carrying out our nearly 100-year-old mission. <BR>
