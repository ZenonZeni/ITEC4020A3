Hua Hu received a B.S. degree in Earth and Space Science from 
University of Science and Technology of China in 1985, and a Ph.D. in 
Geophysics from University of Washington in 1994. 
From 1994.2 to 1995.4, she was a postdoc in Atmospheric Chemistry Element 
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
After May 1995 She became a Member of Technical Staff in Ocean Science Element at JPL.
The title of Hua's Ph.D. dissertation is "Global and local electrical phenomena in 
the stratosphere", focusing on effects of thunderstorms, lightning, fair-weather
electric fields, and cosmic rays on near-earth electrical environment.
Her graduate work involved extensive balloon-borne experiements which gave her 
lots of hands-on hardware and software experience. During her postdoc, 
she studied the variability of atmospheric trace gases, e.g., CO, CH4, N2O, 
and had participated in 45 ER-2 aircraft flights during a NASA ozone 
experiement. Hua's current research interest
focused on water vapor feedback in a global warming scenario, and heat and 
momentum transfer in the planetary boundary layer.
Hua received an Excellent B.S. Thesis
Award in 1985, and a NASA Group Achievement Award in 1995.
