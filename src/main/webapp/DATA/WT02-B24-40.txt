<h2 align=center>RESOLUTION</h2>

<h3 align=center>on<br><br>The Need for Federally Mandated Developmental
Neurotoxicity Testing  to Protect Human Health: Central Nervous System
Development </h3>

<p>The following resolution was adopted by the LDA Assembly of Delegates
on February 25, 1993. 

<p><b>Whereas: <br></b>
(1) The developing brain of the child before birth and in early life is
particularly vulnerable to insult from many substances; and, 

<p>(2) Neurotoxic effects in the developing brain can be both
quantitatively and qualitatively different from effects in mature adult
systems; and, 

<p>(3) Such toxicants can produce permanent alterations in brain
development and function, with subsequent effects on learning abilities
and behavior; and, 

<p>(4) At least 25% of industrial chemicals for which federal
occupational exposure limits have been met, have demonstrated neurotoxic
effects in adult systems; and, 

<p>(5) To date, only a small number of chemicals have been evaluated for
their potential to adversely affect brain development and function; and 

<p>(6) Many national and international organizations have called for
neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral testing for pesticides, food
additives, drugs, and priority chemicals; and, 

<p>(7) Collaborative behavioral teratology studies have provided evidence
of the validity and reliability of neurobehavioral test methods; and, 

<p>(8) Two federal agency reports to Congress have identified a number of
policy issues and options for Congressional action; 

<p><b>Be It Therefore Resolved: </b><br>
That the Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA) urges all
federal agencies, responsible for the regulation and safety of products
for occupational safety and health and for the public health, to require
neurodevelopmental test data as an integral part of safety evaluations
and in setting standards to protect human health; and, 

<p><b>Be It Further Resolved: </b><br>
That LDA urges the Congress to amend and strengthen the statutory
authority of these federal agencies to require the inclusion of
neurodevelopmental data in safety and health evaluations and to ensure
greater access to and exchange of toxicological information. 

<hr>
<p><b>Amplification--LDA Resolution</b><br><i>
(1) The developing brain of the child before birth and in early life is
particularly vulnerable to insult from any substances</i><br> 
A toxic agent can affect the developing nervous system in many ways,
including changes in cell structure, function, production, migration, and
differentiation; and/or with the processes of axon and dendrite growth,
neurochemical mechanisms, synapse formation, and myelination.[l-2] 

<p><i>
(2) Neurotoxic effects in the developing brain can be both quantitatively
and qualitatively different from effects in mature adult systems.</i><br>
In the case of neurotoxicity, children are not "little adults." A safe
exposure cannot be estimated by extrapolating from adult toxic exposures,
because the developing brain may respond quite differently to an
exposure, than does a mature adult brain.[3] 

<p><i>
(3) Such toxicants can produce permanent alterations in brain development
and function, with subsequent effects on learning abilities and behavior.
</i><br>
The American Academy of Pediatrics has noted that early exposure to low
levels of lead incurs a risk of sustained developmental delays and
impaired cognition even in clinically asymptomatic children They
recommend directing pediatric efforts to routine screening, prevention
practices and regulatory action.[4] The Director of the Center for
Research on Mother and Children at the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development (NICHD) has pointed out that prenatal exposure to
many drugs, xenobiotic agents and toxic substances can cause measurable
and permanent behavioral abnormalities in the absence of visible
structural change or measurable physiological change.[5] 

<p><i>
(4) "At least 25% of hazardous industrial chemicals for which
occupational exposure limits have been set, have demonstrated neurotoxic
effects"</i> [6]<br>
The safe exposure limits of 167 of 588 chemicals set by the American
Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists were set on the basis of
their neurotoxicity.[7] The 1984 report by the Office of Technology
Assessment estimates that about one fourth of the chemicals encountered
in industry have neurotoxic effects. [8] 

<p><i>
(5) To date, only a small number of chemicals have been evaluated for
their potential to adversely  affect brain development and function.
</i><br>
Reports from the Office of Technology Assessment and from the General
Accounting Office to the U.S. Congress make this point.[9-10]

<p>There are a few chemicals and one pesticide for which EPA has
developed Test Rules for developmental neurotoxicity, one of the first in
1986.[11] However, no reference dose has been established for
developmental neurotoxicity as yet, and no action or regulation has
resulted from these data. 

<p>Testing for structural malformations is now required, while testing
for injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) is not. Yet neurologic
damage is a much more frequent outcome of chemical exposure than physical
malformations are. The result of our present regulatory policy is that we
are testing agents for neurotoxicologic effects on human subjects without
their consent or knowledge.[12] 

<p>FDA cannot require any toxicity testing for cosmetics[9] and does not
require developmental neurotoxicity data in the evaluation of drugs or
food additives. 

<p><i>
(6) Many national and international organizations have called for
neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral testing for pesticides, food
additives, drugs, and priority chemicals. </i><br>
The World Health Organization recommended in 1984 that efforts were
needed to include neurobehavioral tests for routine use in developmental
toxicity evaluation.[13] The Interagency Committee on Learning
Disabilities, mandated under the Health Research Extension Act of 1985
reported to Congress in 1987. The report recommended that data on
developmental neurotoxicity are needed to protect health and
development.[14] Japan requires several tests for developmental toxicity,
including behavior, in the evaluation of chemicals, especially
pharmaceutical drugs.[l5]

<p>The U.S. Congressional Committee on Agriculture Report pursuant to the
FIFRA Act Amendment of 1988 requested that EPA intensify the degree of
neurotoxicity testing in its pesticide program, including testing related
to prenatal and neonatal effects. 

<p><i>
(7) Collaborative behavioral teratology studies have provided evidence of
the validity and reliability of neurobehavioral lest methods. </i><br>
A major study was conducted in this country to check the comparability of
a number of behavioral tests, across six different laboratories[16]; in
Europe, five laboratories in four countries collaborated in the
evaluation of the detection levels of different test methods[17]; both
showed comparable sensitivities for the behavioral test batteries,
automated test systems, and the neurochemical assays. 

<p><i>
(8) Two federal agency reports to Congress have identified a number of
policy issues and options for Congressional action.</i><br>
The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) Report to the Congress
discusses the risk posed by neurotoxic substances, and evaluates the
Federal research and regulatory programs now in place to assess these
risks. The OTA Report found that neurotoxic chemicals constitute a major
public health threat, and that the social and economic consequences of
adverse effects are potentially very large.[9] 

<p>The US General Accounting Office (GAO) Report to the Senate Committee
on Governmental Affairs identified 30 chemicals that are of high concern
for reproductive and developmental effects. The report found that there
was insufficient protection from current risk assessment decisions, and
that 2/3 of the decisions were not based on reproductive or developmental
(including neurodevelopmental) data. The GAO report states,<i> We believe
it is unlikely that regulation based on other diseases will protect
against  reproductive and developmental outcomes in all cases.</i>[10]
