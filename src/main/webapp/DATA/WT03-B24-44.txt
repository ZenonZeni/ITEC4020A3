adequate background in mathematical methods, computer technology, 
and business knowledge, the program requires three foundation courses.
<P>
<EM>These foundation courses are the following three
George Mason University courses, or equivalent:</EM>

<DD> <B>INFS 515</B> Computer Organization
<DD> <B>INFS 590</B> Program Design and Data Structures
</DL>
<P>  
and, one of the three courses listed below
<P>
<DL>
<DD> <B>ACCT 600</B> Accounting and Reporting

<HR>
<P>
When a prospective student applies to the MSIS program, he or she 
is asked to fill out a departmental self-evaluation form, indicating
whether previously taken courses may satisfy these foundation requirements. 
Upon acceptance, the student is advised of the necessary foundation courses 
to be satisfactorily completed, as articulated courses, to meet this 
requirement. Foundation courses do not earn credit toward the MSIS degree ;
however, a grade of B or better must be obtained in a foundation course. 

<P>
Students may take courses through the Cooperative Graduate Engineering 
Program in affiliation with the University of Virginia and Virginia Tech.
Appropriate courses may be transferred, with adviser approval, into this 
GMU degree program. Refer to the section on <I>Prograrns and Additional
Graduate Courses in the graduate catalog.</I>
<P>
Newly admitted students can obtain a catalog at the Admissions desk in Finley.
Others may purchase one from the Bookstore in Student Union II or by calling
