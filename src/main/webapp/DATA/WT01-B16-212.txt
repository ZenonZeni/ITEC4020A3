  This Issue: <b>W. JOHN DIAMOND, M.D.</b><p>
  <font size="+1"><b>Curing Chronic Fatigue with Homeopathy</b></font><p>
</center>

Here is an intriguing case with many layers and multi-system pathology, involving 14 years of illness and a dramatic outcome only 2 months after treatment.<p>
	When Rebecca, aged 38, first came to me, she had already seen 8 conventional physicians for her multifaceted condition. She had chronic fatigue, depression, joint, muscle, and low back pain, migraine headaches, and severe pelvic and anal pains. Often her knees hurt and her legs would feel heavy. Rebecca had been on antibiotics since she was 20 for pelvic inflammatory disease, but they failed to resolve this problem. She told me she had pain in her pelvis "all the time." <p>
Standard laboratory tests revealed that Rebecca had a low white blood cell count, indicating her immune system was seriously weakened; it also showed she had a high level of Epstein-Barr virus, which is often the case in chronic fatigue patients.<p>

<b>PROBING FAMILY HISTORY</b>. <p>
Rebecca had used 3 different antidepressants but none had lifted her depression. Earlier, a physician had put her on Synthroid, a standard drug for inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis). Rebecca also felt claustrophobic, had frequent panic attacks, was afraid of new medications, was chronically constipated, and had, in her own words, "no energy." She told me that all aspects of her problem worsened at the age of 24, which I later learned was when she got married to a man who already had 3 young children.<p>
Here is how Rebecca described her state: "When I get a bad pain attack in my back or pelvis, it comes over me in waves and I need to go and hide away in my bedroom and just get under the covers and rest. Sometimes it's for days. The energy just ebbs out of me. When I have no energy, my pelvis aches and throbs. I have to sit down to stop the pain. It feels like my uterus will just about drop out of me." <p>
Further, she had memory and concentration problems, craved salty foods, was usually very hot and sweaty while she slept, and woke frequently at night only to stare emptily at the bedroom wall just as she had done as a child, she told me. <p>
I asked her about her childhood. "It was terrible," she said with emphasis. Both parents had been alcoholics and addicted to drugs. Two older brothers were heavy drinkers and sexually abused her. Rebecca said her mother hated her because she was competition for her husband's affections. Rebecca's mother repeatedly told her she was a worthless child, that she was "a nothing, less than a dog." <p>
Beginning at age 6, Rebecca became a surrogate mother for the household since her mother was chronically drunk. Rebec-ca did all the chores around the house. Mean-while, her father was drunk most of the time and often violent. Her parents argued and fought frequently, and when they did, Rebecca would retreat to her bedroom and stare at the wall. In sum, she was extremely passive, quiet, and depressed as a child.<p>
At age 18, she had an abortion, about which she felt exceedingly guilty, and moved out of the family house. She began drinking steadily, and drifted around until she married at age 24 and moved to another town with her husband and his children. Consider what she did here: Rebecca duplicated the situation she had when she was a child. She became the surrogate mother again, which was, truly, the last thing she wanted to do. Eventually her biology decided this arrangement was not what she needed and shut her down with a mass of symptoms.<p>

<b>WHAT ELECTRODERMAL SCREENING SHOWS</b>. <p>
As part of my medical practice, I regularly use electrodermal screening (EDS) to identify hidden energy blockages in the body. It is also an effective way to get beyond times when a patient prefers not to admit a fact from their history or perhaps literally does not remember it; at such times, these hidden facts may be the key to a case.<p>
My electrodermal evaluation of Rebecca showed highly inflammatory conditions in her tonsils and pharynx. A "normal" EDS reading is about 50, but for Rebecca the needle hovered between 70 and 80. It also indicated trouble in her spleen, liver, kidneys, intestines, and uterus. <p>
In some instances there was a sudden change in the readings, from a high to a low value; in the electrodermal screening world, we call this an "indicator drop" and it is a bad sign. It suggests that the organ is leaking energy and may be undergoing severe degeneration, starting at an energy level and moving into a more tangible deterioration. <p>
On the basis of all the evidence I collected about her symptom picture, it seemed clear to me that there was a strong link between her history of childhood sexual abuse and her chronic pelvic problems. In my approach to homeopathy, I think the first time you see a patient, you need to give remedies that will get the physiological system working properly again. This means removing from the body all the obstacles to healing. Then, according to classical homeopathy, you can give a single remedy and see it work like a "bomb."<p>

<b>REMOVING THE OBSTACLES TO HEALING</b>. <p>
I prepared a remedy program for Rebecca consisting of 6 components. My prescribing philosophy in this case was to give her the strongest remedies possible. With 14 years of  not working correctly, her immune system needed major stimulation.<p>
First, I gave her a homeopathic nosode of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at a strength of 200C which she would take once weekly for a month. This would help her body start to eliminate the high levels of EBV in her tonsils, liver, and kidneys. <p>
Second, I gave Rebecca a nosode called Viricin to be taken once daily. This broad-based formula has all the main viruses including EBV but at a low potency. I wanted to be sure to catch all the virus problems. <p>
Third, Rebecca took Rehmannia 6, a remedy composed of Chinese herbs, to address the energy imbalance in her kidneys as evidenced by her night sweats. She took 3 tablets, 3 times daily.<p>
Fourth, I prescribed a homeopathic formula, in this case, for detoxification. This was a combination of 3 low-dose "drainage" remedies (called Liquiessences) for the lymph, kidneys, and liver in potencies of 1X and 2X. Rebecca took these drops 3 times daily.<p>
Fifth, I selected a single homeopathic remedy called Sepia 12C according to classical homeopathic prescribing. Rebecca took Sepia once daily. This remedy comes from squid ink and its maritime qualities (and other psychological and physiological factors) perfectly matched Rebecca's condition—even her choice of words such as "waves" and energy "ebbs." <p>
In fact, her expression that her uterus felt as if it might "fall out" is typical of the type of images that consistently are presented by patients needing Sepia. The sense of her uterus falling out, the sexual abuse, the abortion and the subsequent guilt—these are all connected. It was as if, on a psychological, or metaphorical, level, Rebecca wanted to get rid of her uterus, to push it out so the remembrance of the experience would be gone from her along with the organ that bore its memory. <p>
Sixth, I addressed her chronic constipation and years of excessive antibiotic intake by giving her Multiflora, a "friendly bacteria" or probiotics product. This blend contains Acidophilus and Bifidus cultures and fructo-oligosaccharides (which are helpful "fast food" for the beneficial bacteria). She took 2 capsules, 3 times daily to start restoring the normal population levels and balance of intestinal microflora previously destroyed by all the antibiotics.<p>

<b>CONFRONTING HER PAST</b>.<p>
Rebecca left my office with these 6 remedies and instructions to take them all concurrently, and didn't call me for a month. When she did, her report was highly encouraging. The first several days on the remedies the pelvic pain had worsened, followed by a copious vaginal discharge of in her words, a "smelly yellow liquid." This went on for 3 days, but when it stopped, she felt "so much better." <p>
A temporary worsening of symptoms followed by an often powerful discharge then rapid improvement is typical of how homeopathic remedies work. I interpreted the discharge as her body's way of getting rid of what was ailing in her pelvis. In a sense, her body materialized all the emotional toxins (from parental abandonment, sexual abuse, and other traumatic factors from her personal history) and forcibly expelled them from her body. <p>
While the vaginal discharge was under way, Rebecca was exhausted, but as soon as it was finished, her energy began increasing daily until she estimated about 80% of her normal energy level had returned, meaning how she once felt before she became sick. After a week, her sleep improved and her constipation gave way to normal, daily bowel motions. She stopped feeling cold and stopped craving salt; her panic attacks disappeared and she was no longer fearful about taking new medicines. (Initially, Rebecca had been highly resistant to the remedies and I had to persuade her that it was in her best interest to take them.)<p>
She said that emotionally she felt remarkably improved and that the pain had receded from her anus and pelvis and was localized over the bladder and uterus. Overall, the pain had decreased by 50%, but for me, this wasn't good enough. I was left with a woman whose physical symptom picture had markedly improved yet she still had 50% pain in her pelvis. Using electrodermal screening, I found that there was no evidence of Epstein-Barr virus anywhere in her system; the only organ carrying any imbalance was her uterus.<p>
To address these remaining conditions, I gave her a single homeopathic remedy called Staphysagria (larkspur seeds) at a medium strength of 200C. This remedy often helps break open a condition of internalized anger.<p>
Rebecca came to my office a month later with good and surprising news. The day after she took the Staphysagria, her anger welled up so strongly that she was mad at everyone in her life—husband, children, and parents. She telephoned the latter and directly confronted them with their neglect and abuse of her as a child. She had avoided speaking with them for years before this moment. Then she took an angle iron and smashed up her garage door until all the anger was discharged. From that moment, the remaining pelvic pain disappeared and has not returned. <p>
