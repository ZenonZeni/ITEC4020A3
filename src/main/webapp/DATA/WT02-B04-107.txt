CDT ANALYSIS OF REVISED EXON INDECENCY LEGISLATION
<p>
I.  OVERVIEW
<p>
A revised version of the Communications Decency Act (S.314) was<br>
added to the Senate telecommunications reform legislation as the <br>
reform bill was reported out of the Senate Commerce Committee. <br>
In an important improvement over the original version, several <br>
exemptions have been created to limit criminal liability of <br>
online services providers where they exercise no control over<br> 
content.  However, despite this significant change the bill is<br> 
still an unconstitutional intrusion of the free speech and<br> 
privacy rights of Internet users and all content providers in <br>
interactive media.   (The complete text of the bill interleaved <br>
into the current statute is attached at the end of this Policy<br> 
Post.)<br>
<p>
In simple terms, the Communications Decency Act would enshrine in<br>
statute a sharp distinction between the print medium and new <br>
interactive media.  The bill subjects interactive media to the <br>
same weak First Amendment protections that have evolved for mass<br> 
media.  Moreover, it places all speech that occurs on the<br> 
Internet and elsewhere in cyberspace under the jurisdiction of <br>
the Federal Communications Commission.  Both the interactive<br> 
media and the print media are arenas in which individuals and<br> 
organizations exercise core First Amendment free speech rights.<br>  
Thus, new interactive media -- which includes not only email and<br> 
Internet servicese, but also interactive TV, video on demand and <br>
distance learning -- must be protected by the First Amendment.<br>
<p>
The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) remains actively <br>
opposed to this bill.  With the help of Senator Leahy and other<br> 
civil liberties advocates in Congress, we will fight to keep it<br> 
from being enacted and continue to search for alternatives to<br> 
this dangerous legislation.  CDT believes that federal <br>
legislation is needed to solidify free speech rights and clarify<br> 
online service provider liability.  Without such legislation, a<br> 
series of state legislative proposed as bad or worse than the <br>
Exon/Gorton bill will proliferate.  Restrictive proposals already<br> 
under consideration in states such as Maryland, Oregon, and <br>
Washington must be pre-empted.  We will work with concerned<br> 
legislators and theInteractive Working Group (an ad hoc coalition<br> 
of public interest organizations, and computer, communication,<br> 
and publishing firms) to develop alternatives.<br>
<p>
II.  ANALYSIS OF CURRENT PROPOSAL
<p>
The Exon/Gorton bill was introduced to promote the important<br> 
purpose of protecting minors from access to controversial and<br> 
inappropriate sexually explicit material in interactive media<br> 
including the Internet, other commercial online services,<br> 
electronic bulletin board services (BBS's). However, because the <br>
proposed statute is grafted onto a twenty five year-old provision<br> 
of the Communications Act which was designed for a centralized <br>
monopoly telephone environment, instead of diverse, decentralized <br>
interactive media, it both fails to accomplish its goal and is<br> 
unconstitutional on its face.  In spite of the changes made by<br> 
Senator Exon, the bill still suffers the following critical<br> 
defects from the standpoint of users and content<br> 
providers:<br>
<p>
1.      SECOND CLASS FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS FOR USERS AND CONTENT <br>
PROVIDERS ON THE NET AND ALL INTERACTIVE MEDIA:  Even though many <br>
laud cyberspace as the new electronic gutenberg printing press<br> 
accessible to all, the Exon bill treats the Internet, interactive<br> 
television, and video dialtone systems as if they were one big<br> 
radio station whose broadcasts are constantly assaulting<br>
unwilling listeners.  Those who use these new technologies know<br> 
that this is not the case.  However, viewing interactive media as<br> 
an extension of broadcasting diminishes the First Amendment <br>
rights of all who use these systems and create content for<br> 
them.  For example, though an individual is allowed to go into a <br>
bookstore and buy a sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work<br> 
of art, one would not be able to access the identical information<br> 
over the Internet if this legislation is enacted. <br>   
<p>
2.      FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION JURISDICTION OVER <br>
ONLINE SPEECH:  The defenses to prosecution established in the<br> 
new version of the bill gives the Federal Communications <br>
Commission jurisdiction to establish rules governing distribution<br> 
of content online.  This will have a dramatic chilling effect on <br>
online activity and squelch the development of interactive media. <br> 
Regulation of indecency in this new medium is a bad precedent for<br> 
all kinds of speech in the interactive world.<br>
<p>
3.      CRIMINALIZATION OF BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MESSAGES THAT<br> 
ARE NOT OBSCENE: The Act criminalizes not only obscene, but also <br>
"lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent" communications, all of<br> 
which are protected by the First Amendment and cannot be banned. <br> 
<p>
4.      IMPERMISSIBLY INTRUSIVE MEANS OF ACHIEVING LEGITIMATE<br> 
GOAL: First Amendment jurisprudence requires that restrictions on<br> 
speech adopt the "least restrictive means" available for <br>
achieving a compelling purpose.Relying on technological<br> 
assumptions applicable only to 900 number services and a <br>
centrally-controlled telephone system, the Act fails to account <br>
for the fact that government restriction on content is<br> 
unnecessary in interactive media, where parents can control the<br> 
content that their children access.<br>
<p>
5.      FAULTY ANALOGY TO BROADCAST MEDIA: Proponents of the Act<br> 
have justified the constitutionality by improper reliance on<br> 
content restrictions found acceptable in broadcast media. These <br>
arguments fail to recognize that while broadcast media may<br> 
"assult" unwilling listeners, who may be in need of government<br> 
protection, interactive media enables users to control the<br> 
information that they receive.<br>
<p>
6.      INVASION OF PRIVACY:  By criminalizing the content of<br> 
private, non- obscene messages, the Act would force an invasion<br> 
of the realm of private electronic communications and end the<br> 
individual's ability to control the content of information he or<br> 
she chooses to access in private.<br>
<p>
Alternative means of achieving the goal of protecting minors from<br> 
access to material considered inappropriate by their parents<br> 
would include:<br>
<p>
1.      FEDERAL LEGISLATION ESSENTIAL TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH ON<br> 
THE NET: CDT believes that there mujst be federal legislation to <br>
solidify free speech rights and clarify carrier liability which <br>
pre-empts state legislation in this area.  Otherwise, as series <br>
of state legislative proposed where are as bad or worse than the <br>
Exon/Gorton bill will proliferate.  <br>
<p>
2.      MAXIMUM RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY TO EMPOWER PARENTS: <br> 
Interactive media offers parents and other users the ability to <br>
filter certain kinds of content.  Instead of relying on <br>
government censorship, or even government-imposed rating systems, <br>
parents should be able to block the delivery of certain <br>
information to their children on the basis of their<br> 
own individual tastes and preferences.<br>
<p>
3.      CLEAR PROTECTION FOR CONSTITUTIONALLY-PERMISSIBLE SPEECH: <br> 
Any alternative legislation must provide affirmative protection <br>
for constitutionally-permissible speech, even if it is lewd, <br>
filthy or otherwise controversial.  The First Amendment demands <br>
that offensive or disturbing speech must be treated separately <br>
than that which is clearly obscene and unprotected.<br>
<p>
4.      EMPHASIS ON ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING STATUTES:  Federal <br>
and state law already prohibits transportation of obscenity, <br>
child pornography, as well as, in many instances threats, <br>
stalking and harassment.  To the extent that there are obstacles <br>
to enforcing these laws in the new on-line environment, Congress <br>
should examine whether new law is required, or whether more <br>
resources for enforcement (including training for law enforcement <br>
in interactive services and cooperative efforts with the <br>
industry).<br>
<p>
5.      CODIFICATION SEPARATELY FROM EXISTING DIAL-A-PORN <br>
STATUTE: Modification of the existing ¤ 223, originally written <br>
for the analogue telephone system, to regulate new interactive <br>
media causes unnecessary confusion, both for the treatment of the<br> 
new technology and with respect to the stability of the<br> 
regulation of audiotext services. If new legislation is written, <br>
it should stand on its own. Moreover, Congress should consider <br>
which elements properly belong in the Communications Act and <br>
which in the Criminal Code.<br>
<p>
The regulation of speech, commerce, and privacy rights in new <br>
interactive communications systems raises many difficult issues <br>
of public policy and constitutional law.  Before proceeding with <br>
legislation, Congress must provide the opportunity for public <br>
hearings to identify clearly the problems that exist, and to <br>
identify solutions that are appropriate to the new technology. <br> 
Failure to do so will result in ineffective policy, years of <br>
constitutional litigation, and a disastrous chilling effect on<br> 
the development and growth of a very promising new communications <br>
medium.<br>
