COMING OF AGE IN PRAGUE

THE focus of attention this year  in the Czech Republic will inevitably
be on the parliamentary elections in the summer. Political
considerations have already hit an ambitious plan to sell minority
stakes in the country's 16 gas and electricity distribution companies
(eight of each), which has been postponed indefinitely. In the week
before Christmas Roman Ceska, head of the National Property Fund, the
state holding company, said there would be no further strategic
privatizations before the election.

The action, however, is likely to be elsewhere. The last quarter of
1995 saw what many feel could be the start of a new trend - a series of
takeovers, some of them hostile, and large investments by foreign
investors. Among the most notable are Bankers Trust's $250 million
purchase of stakes in two investment funds from Ceska Sporitelna (see
page 4), and the acquisition of stakes in seven leading industrial
companies by Stratton Investments in partnership with Viktor Kozeny's
Harvard fund management group.

Michael Dingman, the Bahamas-based US millionaire who owns Stratton,
has made much of the ground-breaking aspect of his investment company,
with some justification. Stratton's alliance with Harvard allows a
powerful and rich entrepreneur to team up with an equally powerful
entrepreneur with a good reputation for innovation but with little
financial firepower.

Stratton's strategy appears so far to be paying off. Daniel Arbess, a
senior Dingman associate, acknowledges that its original investment is
greater than the $140 million initially mentioned, and is "closer to
$200 million". But he says the stakes, before recent increases in two
of them, are now worth $240 million. Stratton and Harvard have also
gained control of Sepap, the paper group, and the glass holding company
Sklo Union, through boardroom reshuffles.

Bankers Trust's acquisition is the biggest deal yet on the Prague
capital markets. Although the opportunity was relatively rare - Ceska
Sporitelna was under pressure from the Czech National Bank and its
auditors to reduce the stakes it owns in the funds it runs - fund
managers are increasingly taking the view that this type of development
is both inevitable and desirable.

As an investor, Dingman says he sees less risk in the Czech market than
in a Dow Jones index above 5,000. Whether other investors feel that way
will depend on several issues that should be clarified in 1996.

The first is whether an amendment to the securities law is approved.
Tomas Jezek, author of the amendment and a proposed chairman of the PSE
from next summer, is proposing substantial reform of the market that
should offer greater protection to small investors, establish clear
rules for takeovers, and make the stock market more transparent.

But Jezek's proposal is ground down in parliament, which is not likely
to debate it until February, at the earliest. It is facing opposition
from fund managers anxious to preserve the secrecy that currently
surrounds share-dealing. Stratton and Harvard were able to exploit this
secrecy and lack of disclosure to the hilt in developing their alliance
and short term strategy for the companies they targeted. Jezek says he
is confident of having his amendment approved but does not yet know
when that is likely to happen.

The second crucial influence will be the attitude of the bank-run and
independent investment funds to the new wave of foreign money coming
into the market. Ales Barabas, director of capital markets at
Zivnostenska Banka, says fund managers have no objection in principle
to ceding control of their funds to new managers. But he doubts whether
the market is mature enough to ensure that the process is orderly.

He cites the example of Motoinvest, a financial conglomerate that
emerged in November when it made hostile takeovers for some bank-run
funds. Motoinvest's campaign was characterized by secrecy and elements
of greenmail, and its intentions are still not entirely clear.
Executives at the financial group strongly deny greenmail charges and
point out that the promise of more active management they offer has
simply caused larger fund managers to freeze them out.

Barabas says recent developments suggest that, far from being ready for
the next phase of development as a more mature market, recent
developments show the PSE still in "a privatization phase", where banks
are still keen to exert control of assets. There is the potential for
the so-called "third wave" of privatization, he believes, but not the
will among the main shareholders in the market.

Further pressure on the shareholding structure inherited from mass
privatization is likely to be exerted by a third factor that will come
into play in 1996 - Czech membership of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Analysts suggest that one of the first
results of membership will be a re-rating of the country as an
investment location, which could spark a fresh wave of capital for
longer term investment. Both Stratton and Bankers Trust are being
touted as examples of this development.

This in turn leads to a fourth consideration - of what action the Czech
National Bank takes on the koruna's exchange rate against the dollar
and deutschemark. Economists say they expect a move early in the New
Year to widen the band against which the koruna fluctuates - currently
half a percentage point either side of parity - to perhaps five points
either side. This could lead to an early but temporary revaluation, to
be followed by a more gradual move towards devaluation, perhaps
encouraged by the monetary authorities ahead of the election to boost
exports.

The Czech market is clearly at a turning point, with pressure building
on several fronts for more consolidation, a freer currency, and greater
transparency in its operations. Policy makers will have to play a
delicate balancing act between the demands of the market on the one
hand and political considerations on the other in what will be a true
test of the country's maturity as a grown-up member of the club of rich
nations.

ANALYSTS BULLISH ON 1996 PROSPECTS

Central Europe watchers think the Czech economy is poised to surge
ahead this year, building on the dynamic growth of 1995.

Industry has boomed, pushing third quarter 1995 GDP 6.3 per cent higher
year-on-year, mostly on the back of strong home demand. Analysts are
confident of further gains in 1996. "We should see growth of 4.7 per
cent in the light of the [1995] third quarter results, and [in 1996] it
will probably be between 5.0 and 6.0 per cent," says Pavel Sobisek of
Zivnostenska Banka. Real GDP for the first nine months of 1995 stood at
4.8 per cent, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU).

Scott Riedel, treasurer of Citibank in Prague, also expects strong 1996
growth but says the country is far from emulating levels seen in the
Asian Tiger economies. "We're looking at around the five per cent level
of 1996 and that's probably conservative. But this economy is quite
young still, and it's a long way behind Far East countries like
Malaysia in terms of sustainable high growth," says Riedel.

While the Czech Republic stands at the higher end of the East European
growth table, it has yet to attract the sort of huge foreign investment
that sparked rapid growth in Southeast Asia. To close the gap with the
rich Western economies more rapidly - something that many in Eastern
and Central Europe see as a primary goal - investment must accelerate,
analysts say. "It is necessary, but I'm just wondering whether we'll
see sustainable increases," says Riedel. The Asian tigers continue to
devour much of the foreign direct investment (FDI) earmarked for
emerging markets.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus hopes the feel-good factor arising from the
booming economy will win his centre-right coalition government another
term in office in this summer's elections. The Czech reform process has
been considerably more stable than in other former Soviet bloc
countries, with year-on-year inflation at eight per cent in November
and unemployment standing at 2.8 per cent. But official figures
compiled by the EBRD in its transition report for 1995 showed sharp
falls in real GDP in the first years of reform.

The EBRD recorded a 14.2 per cent drop in real GDP in 1991 followed by
further, but less spectacular, declines in the next two years, before
an upturn in 1994 when growth hit 2.6 per cent. Even with EBRD-
projected growth of five per cent in 1995, the organization put 1995
real Czech GDP at just 85 per cent of the level before the fall of
communism in 1989. It warned, however, that such comparisons should be
treated with caution because of conceptual and data collection problems
when comparing market and planned economies.

STRATTON MOVES INTO MEDIA

Stratton Investments, owned by the Bahamas-based investor Michael
Dingman, has made a further push into the Czech market with an
agreement in principle to buy a 15 per cent stake in Premiera TV, a
commercial television station.

Stratton said on December 6 it would buy the stake from Investicni a
Postovni Banka (IPB), one of the main commercial banks. If the purchase
is approved by the state broadcasting council IPB's stake in Premiera
will fall to 30 per cent. The bank has been seeking a buyer for the
stake for several months.

"The deal launches Stratton's investment in the media industry in
Central Europe and CIS countries. We look forward to working together
with IPB on this and hopefully other investments in the future,"
Stratton said. Terms were not disclosed.

It is also a departure for Dingman, who stormed into the market in
October, buying stakes in seven industrial companies from Viktor
Kozeny's Harvard fund management group. Premiera is the first
acquisition from a local investor other than Harvard.

Stratton said it was ready to provide Premiera access to "all world-
wide programming resources" and with "foreign experts with a high level
of broadcasting knowledge." Premiera currently reaches less than half
the nationwide audience and is seeking to expand in the teeth of fierce
competition from Nova TV.

Nova, majority-owned by Central European Media Enterprises, which is in
turn controlled by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, became eastern
Europe's first commercial TV station in early 1993. It has captured a
huge slice of the local advertising market with a successful mix of
imported mass-market series.

Earlier this year IPB was reportedly in talks with companies connected
to Turner Broadcasting and Capital Cities/ABC, the US media giants.
Scandinavian Broadcasting System, which is partially owned by Cap
Cities, has also been mooted as a buyer.

Separately, Stratton bought additional stakes in two of its original
seven investments from the fund management arm of Ceska Sporitelna, the
savings bank. These transactions took its stakes in Prazska
Telparenska, the heating utility for Prague, and in glass industry
holding company Sklo Union to 43 per cent and 66.5 per cent
respectively. The stakes are held jointly by Stratton and Harvard.

Stratton and Harvard have also taken control of the entire management
board of Sklo Union, appointing seven representatives of Harvard at a
shareholder meeting on December 5. The move is similar to the takeover
of the board of Sepap, the paper group now controlled by both
investment companies.

EBRD SELLS COKOLADOVNY STAKE

The EBRD has sold its 12.07 per cent stake in the confectionery company
Cokoladovny to Copart, a joint venture between Nestle of Switzerland
and Danone of France that already owns 56 per cent of the chocolate and
biscuit maker.

Terms were not disclosed but the EBRD said in a statement on December 6
that the sale and price of the shares to Copart was agreed at the time
of the privatization of Cokoladovny in 1992, when the EBRD first
acquired its stake. The stake has a market value currently of about $35
million.

Guy de Selliers, deputy vice president of banking at the EBRD, said in
the statement that the Cokoladovny stake represented the bank's most
mature investment in the country, and was also its first divestment.

Describing Cokoladovny as a successfully transformed company able to
compete and succeed in its markets, de Selliers said the sale was "a
natural departure for the EBRD." The bank expects the proceeds of the
sale to be used for other investment purposes in the Czech Republic as
its focus shifts to investing in post-privatization industry.

LIST OF BIDDERS FOR GSM GROWS

TeleDanmark and Telenor, of Denmark and Norway respectively, are to
make a joint bid for a 49 per cent stake in a GSM mobile telephone
licence, one of two being awarded by the government. The companies said
on December 20 that they would be "equal partners" in their joint
venture but that TeleDanmark would have a majority stake to abide by
rules of a tender for the stake.

Separately, the electricity generator CEZ said it would be making a
joint bid for the licence stake with RWE Telliance of Germany. A third
partner may join that consortium, but TeleDanmark and Telenor said they
would not be seeking a local partner.

The two alliances join a growing list of domestic and international
bidders seeking to win the stake in the licence. The domestic
technology group Ceske Radiokomunikace, which operates television and
radio signal transmission in the country, will own 51 per cent of the
licence.

The licence will cost about $15 million but developing a nationwide GSM
network is set to cost "several hundred million dollars," said Harald
Grytten of Telenor, the dominant Norwegian telecoms provider. Industry
analysts have put the cost of a new network at between $300 million and
$500 million. Most of the finance to develop it will be provided by the
selected partner.

A second GSM licence is being awarded to EuroTel, a joint venture
between the national operator SPT Telecom and the US groups Bell
Atlantic and US West. EuroTel was the first Czech/foreign joint venture
created after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and has been providing
mobile services since 1990 using low-frequency NMT technology
throughout former Czechoslovakia.

Other groups and consortiums bidding for the stake in the licence
include AirTouch of the US, France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom,
Mannesmann of Germany in partnership with the engineering group Skoda
Plzen, and a consortium of domestic energy distribution companies in a
probable alliance with Telecom Finland.

Bids for the stake, setting out development plans and a timetable for
creating the GSM network, are expected to be sought by the end of
January. A partner for Ceske Radiokomunikace should be chosen by next
March.

BANKERS TRUST BUYS INTO FUNDS

Bankers Trust has bought stakes of 40 per cent in two investment funds
owned and run by Ceska Sporitelna, the savings bank, in the biggest one-
off deal ever on Prague's fledgling capital markets.

The US bank is paying Kc 6.7 billion for the stakes and has said it
will seek to sell them on to other Western investors. It will pay for
the stakes by issuing five-year zero-coupon notes to the savings bank.
During the life of the notes Sporitelna will retain all dividends on
the shares and retain the voting rights on three quarters of each
stake.

Bankers Trust will repay the notes in cash or shares or a combination
of both, depending on whether it has been able to sell the shares in
the funds on to new investors. If it retains any shares in the funds
after five years these shares will be returned to Sporitelna to pay off
the notes.

Sporitelna has been under pressure from its auditors and the Czech
National Bank for some time to reduce the stakes it holds in its own
investment funds.  Under current legislation a bank cannot own more
than 10 per cent of any non-banking asset, including investment funds.

The bank acquired the shares when thousands of its clients defaulted on
loans it issued using individual shareholdings in its funds as
collateral following a slide on the Prague stock exchange during 1994.

Bankers Trust has been developing a relationship with Sporitelna for
several years and is understood to be planning an issue of global
depository shares for the savings bank as part of a long-term strategy.
But Sporitelna is regarded as the weakest of the big four Czech banks
because of its failure to diversify sufficiently away from its core
savings business.

Sporitelna is the biggest lender on the Prague interbank market and has
been hit hard by the instability of some of the country's smaller
banks. It has been exposed to two recent collapses; those of AB Banka -
which it subsequently acquired - and Ceska Banka, which is in
liquidation after collapsing in the autumn. The disposal of the stakes
in its investment funds should enable it to strengthen its balance
sheet.

POLITICAL JITTERS FOR STOCK EXCHANGE

Recent political events have taken their toll on the Warsaw Stock
Exchange. Its main WIG indicator has slipped by 7 per cent since the
last session on November 17, when investors were still confident that
Lech Walesa would win the presidential election.

The news that former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski had won by a
narrow majority took 3.8 per cent off the WIG and the market's slow
recovery in the weeks following was ended by another 3.5 per cent fall
on December 20 in the wake of a public accusation that prime minister
Jozef Oleksy was a Russian agent.

The setback, against the background of low morale on the stock exchange
dating back to before the summer, has caused companies hoping to profit
from stock exchange listings to have second thoughts. Examples include
Forte, a Polish-German furniture producer, which delayed its initial
public offer sine die, and chemicals producer  Boryszew, due to open
its IPO of 600,000 shares priced at Zl 15 at the end of November, but
which has now postponed it until January 10.

January will also see the public offer of 3 million shares in the Ocean
Company, a fledgling retail chain, and Lodzka Drukarnia Akcydensowa,
which specializes in printing for packaging, will be offering between
625,000 and 1.7 million shares priced at Zl 5. The issue by the
company, which has been owned by its management and employees since
1991, has been underwritten by Polish Development Bank (PBR) and the
Lodz-based Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy (PBG), which have agreed to take
300,000 shares for a 5 per cent fee.

Polisa, the private insurance company which came to prominence during
the presidential campaign when it transpired that the wives of both
Kwasniewski and Oleksy hold its shares (see FEE 5:23) has seen the
placement of 1.2 million of its shares in a public offer of between
800,000 and 3.2 million shares priced at Zl 8. Reportedly the
purchasers of around 60 per cent of the shares placed were Bel Leasing
and Forin, two companies controlled by Bank IG, which seems to be
planning to add an insurance arm to its group.

In another development Bank Handlowy has taken a 13.1 per cent stake in
the Wolczanka shirt producer. The stake comes from the bankrupt Bank
Przemyslowo Handlowy (BHK) in Katowice, which is currently being wound
up. The securities commission has given Heineken permission to purchase
BHK's stake in the Zywiec brewery, increasing its stake from its
present 24.9 per cent to 31.8 per cent. The Zywiec stock price has
fallen by 10 per cent recently in the wake of an announcement by Adam
Loewe, the brewery's chief executive, that he would be resigning in the
new year.

Bank Handlowy's move in taking a larger stake in Wolczanka reflects
part of a wider strategy towards the textile sector. Recently the BH
announced that it would be part of a consortium including Wolczanka,
Prochnik and Vistula which aims to bid for the DT Centrum chain of city
centre department stores which are to be privatized this year. Handlowy
has also taken a stake in the Poltex textile mill in Lodz, in exchange
for the company's debts. Meanwhile Wolczanka  is to purchase half of
Handlowy's Poltex equity and is to act as the bank's partner in the
venture.

MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUES PLANNED

Several cities were planning to issue bonds to finance infrastructural
developments as the year closed. Gdansk, which wants to raise Zl 90
million this way and has shortlisted three advisers, is the furthest
along the path.

Gdansk, which wants to help fund the construction of a wholesale goods
distribution centre for the city as well as improve its road link with
its local airport at Rembiechowo has shortlisted ING, the Bank PKO BP
and a group composed of Merrill Lynch, Bank Handlowy and Bank Gdanski
as potential advisers for the project.

Meanwhile Gdynia is considering giving a mandate to ING to raise Zl 28
million through bonds to finance the purchase of 50 Mercedes buses for
the city's transportation system. Lodz, which has yet to take final
decisions on the issue, is also talking of raising Zl 50 million for
new bus purchases.

Other cities considering bond issues are Krakow, which has pencilled in
the sum of Zl 5 million as an initial placement and Warsaw which has
said it would like to finance the construction of a new bridge across
the Vistula river through bonds. Meanwhile Wroclaw has appointed Bank
Handlowy as its financial adviser without specifying whether bonds or
loans will be used to finance its municipal needs. Ostrow Wielkopolski
is another potential bond player with a planned Zl 7.5 million issue.

Most cities are planning a private issue to avoid the costs and delay
accompanying a public placement.

ING, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan appear to be the foreign investment
banks which have targeted this sector of Poland's financial services
market as a speciality while locally Bank Handlowy and Bank IG are
hoping to serve municipal needs.

MPP GAINING MOMENTUM

The Mass Privatization Programme (MPP) is moving ahead as equity in a
further 99 state sector companies has been allocated to the 15 national
investment funds and coupons entitling people to shares in the funds
are trading at over double their initial price.

Some 2.5 million of the 28 million  people eligible have so far picked
up their coupons, which have been available since November 22. The
coupons, priced at Zl 20, are currently trading at between Zl 50 and Zl
60 and have even been reported as being accepted as common currency
(notoriously in one example by a "social agency", a local euphemism for
a brothel).

The allocations of the equity in the new companies brings the number
now involved up to 513 and the new tranche include valuable assets such
as the Nowiny cement works, the Gryf confectionery producer as well as
the successful Morliny meat processing works in Ostroda near Olsztyn.

Meanwhile the Solidarity-led opposition is keeping up a drum beat of
criticism of the scheme ahead of a referendum planned for February 19.
Poles are to be asked whether they are in favour of "enfranchisement",
Solidarity's word for Czech-style coupon privatization which the trade
union movement argues spread ownership more democratically than the
modes favoured by successive governments in Poland. Critics say Polish
privatization has so far supported efforts by the former Communist
nomenklatura in gaining control over the economy. This argument has now
gained some credibility after President Walesa's electoral defeat.

Deputies from the governing Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) have however
voted through parliament a number of additional questions to be asked
in the referendum. These include a query on the extension of the MPP by
adding more companies (the SLD's coalition partner the Polish Peasant
Party (PSL) was opposed on the grounds that the scheme should be given
time to prove itself before it is expanded). Other new questions dwell
on whether state assets now worth an estimated Zl 75 billion should be
used to capitalize pension funds envisaged under welfare spending
reforms as well as to compensate government employees and pensioners
who suffered unlawful wage cuts at the hands of the administration in
1991 and 1992. Finally the opposition Freedom Union (UW) managed to
force through an amendment which specified that privatization could
include "coupons", which helped to define the enfranchisement question
originally put forward by Solidarity and backed by Lech Walesa.

BUDGET LOOKS FOR $720M OF STATE ASSET DISPOSALS

Disposals of state-owned corporate assets in 1996 are expected to raise
Zl 1.8 billion ($720 million) according to the draft budget for the
year. This is slightly more than the Zl 1.7 billion raised last year
from sales of treasury-owned companies or 13 per cent more than the
figure written into the 1995 budget target.

At the same time the government intends to continue to squeeze
privatization advisory costs which ran to 5 per cent of revenues last
year down to 4 per cent of this year's inflows. This suggests that the
privatization ministry will continue to favour local companies in
tenders for advisory work.

However it can be expected that the sale of a minority stake in the
giant copper producer KGHM Polska Miedz SA will see the appointment of
a foreign adviser. A tender has been announced and bids have to be in
by January 23 for what could be the largest sale of the year through
both GDRs and the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

Other major sales will be DT Centrum, the state-owned chain of
department stores which controls a series of city centre sites in the
country's largest towns and Ruch, once the all powerful newspaper
distribution network. PHS, which is what remains of the state's
wholesale network is to be another "infrastructural" sale in 1996.

In all privatization minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek hopes to dispose of
around 90 companies to local and foreign investors. These will include
breweries in Tychy and Zabrze in southern Poland and Lezajsk in the
south east. A start is also to be made on the heavy chemical sector,
with three bidders shortlisted for two chemical producers,  Janikosody
and Soda Matwy. These are RhOne Poulenc, Brunner Mond and state-owned
chemicals and pharmaceuticals trader Ciech. Other sectors which will
see disposals according to Kaczmarek are cement, furniture and meat
processing.

The minister has also outlined a number of possible public offers which
could include the Celuloza paper works in Swiecie, three fertilizer
producers in Pulawy, Tarnow and Kedzierzyn Kozle. Also included are
Zelmer, a white goods producer in Rzeszow and Polar, which specializes
in washing machines and cookers in Wroclaw.

The list could be supplemented by any one of the three tobacco
producers in Krakow, Poznan or Lodz which the ministry still has on
offer after receiving unsatisfactory bids from investors who include
Philip Morris and Reemstma.

Impexmetal, the still state-owned metals trader which has purchased the
Konin aluminium mill and has plans to swap its debts for equity in the
Zawiercie steel mill, is also expected to be listed this year.

BANK GDANSKI IPO A SUCCESS

Bank Gdanski's privatization, which saw the first use in Poland of
GDRs, drew to a successful conclusion just before Christmas with 60.06
per cent of the equity in private hands and a slight upward trend on
the Warsaw Stock Exchange following the bank's listing at its initial
public offer price of Zl 24.

However the sale was only saved thanks to Bank IG, which took two-
thirds of the domestic tranche and ended up with a 24.07 per cent share
of Gdanski's equity. It was the first time that one of the new small
banks has forged a strategic link with one of the, larger, regional
banks hived off from the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in 1989.
Hitherto private sector banks have concentrated on buying up smaller
institutions to extend their branch network.

Bank IG's move, initiated by its founder and chairman Boguslaw Kott, a
46 year-old former finance ministry official, meant that 527,518 shares
were moved from the foreign to the domestic tranche leaving 7 million
shares or 35.7 per cent of Bank Gdanski's equity in local hands
alongside the treasury's 37 per cent stake.

The reduction in the foreign tranche which HSBC Investment Services,
the government's adviser for the sale, had originally set at between
5.9 million to 6.5 million shares (30 per cent to 33 per cent of the
equity) still saw foreign demand for the BG shares falling short of
supply. In the end HSBC and Daiwa Europe, who acted as joint lead
managers, and were backed by Schroders and Creditanstalt acting
together with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, SBC Warburg and MC Securities,
guaranteed a mere 4.8 million shares, which ended up with Bank of New
York as the security for the GDRs.

The underwriters took a 4 per cent fee for the service and have
reportedly placed the stock with institutions in Europe and North
America. The GDRs are currently traded at the issue price of $9.48 in
London through the SEAQ international trading system.

GSM AUCTION REMAINS TROUBLED

On January 3 the telecommunications ministry confirmed that three
consortia, all including both domestic and foreign firms, had placed
bids  for the controversial tender for two digital GSM mobile telephone
operating licences.

Telecoms and power equipment trader Elektrim heads one consortium, with
US West as the chief foreign partner, while state-owned chemicals
trader Ciech has teamed up with Stet of Italy in the second group. The
most domestic-ally oriented consortium seems to be the third, led by
the Petrochemia Plock oil refinery and includes KGHM, the domestic
copper conglomerate, PSE, the Polish Power Grid Company, and Tele
Danmark. Foreign partners are limited by the terms of the tender to no
more than 49 per cent of the equity in each group.

But problems and recriminations remain. France Telecom Mobile looks
likely to take the government to court, joining Ameritech, which has
already gone to arbitration to wrest one of the licences from the
authorities. Both companies are basing their claim on a letter written
by the government in 1991, when they won a tender to develop an NMT
mobile telephone system, promising them the GSM licence when the
requisite frequencies became available.

Under the conditions of the tender winning consortia will have to pay
an initial ECU 100 million licence fee augmented by annual payments for
a set period thereafter. The total investment costs of each project are
estimated at $1.2 billion. One factor which is worrying prospective
bidders is that the tender documents do not specify the size of the
interconnect fee the mobile operator will have to pay TP SA, the state-
owned land system operator, for connections with land-based
subscribers. This, according to the tender, will be negotiated with TP
SA once the winners of the bid have been chosen.

LUCCHINI IN MODERNIZATION PROJECT FOR HUTA WARSZAWA

Lucchini, the Italian private steel maker, which took over the Huta
Warszawa steelworks in Warsaw three years ago, has embarked on a three-
stage ECU 161.1 million modernization project for the works.

Lucchini's modernization project, which is financed by the IFC, the
EBRD and a consortium of Italian banks, has been delayed by problems
with establishing the tenure of the land on which the Huta Warszawa is
located. However the group expects to report an around Zl 20 million
net profit for the plant for 1995 following a Zl 1.5 million net profit
in 1994 and a Zl 2.7 million loss the year before. The ECU 65.2 million
first stage will see the steel mill refurbished using equipment from
Danieli of Italy.

In all the modernization programme which will be completed in the
autumn of 1998 will increase the plant's capacity to 1 million tonnes
of steel a year. Last year Huta Lucchini Warszawa produced 380,000
tonnes of steel products and this will rise to 400,000 tonnes this
year.

Meanwhile Stalexport, the listed steel trader, which was forced last
October to withdraw a new share issue which would have raised between
Zl 30 million and Zl 150 million, has completed the construction of a
Zl 155 million modern mini mill at its Labedy works in Silesia. This
will give the mill $30 per tonne savings in energy costs on an annual
output of 350,000 tonnes of semi finished castings. Labedy, which
Stalexport plans to take over when the steel sector is privatized,
specializes in supplies for the Polish coal mining industry.

The equipment for the mini mill was supplied by Mannesman-Demag as well
as Concast Standard from Switzerland and was 28 per cent paid for with
supplier credits as well as a loan amounting to 40 per cent of the cost
from Poland's Environmental Protection Fund (NFOS). The remaining 32
per cent came from Stalexport and the Labedy works.

Stalexport's prospects for a return to its planned new share issue
remain dim. Major existing shareholders like Bank Handlowy and the
Pioneer investment fund who paid Zl 34 per share at the initial public
offer are insisting that any new issues should be priced at around this
level. Meanwhile the company's current share price is languishing
around the Zl 24 per share mark and shows little sign of rising in the
near term. The share issue was to have included a placement abroad
through GDRs with HSBC Investment Services acting as an adviser to
Stalexport.

FRENCH PURCHASER FOR TOBACCO WORKS

The state-owned Radom tobacco works, which control around 13 per cent
of the domestic market, has been sold to Seita, the recently privatized
French cigarette producer. The sale follows the purchase of the
Augustow works by BAT Industries and leaves the government with a
further three companies in Krakow, Lodz and Poznan still on offer.

Seita has agreed to pay $64 million for a 33 per cent stake in Radom
with the option to purchase a further 32 per cent of the equity for a
nominal fee after completing a $40 million investment programme over
three years. Earlier BAT agreed to pay $88 million for a similar stake
in Augustow, which controls 12 per cent of the market and promised to
invest $70 million in the plant.

Market shares however are changing following a pre-privatization
government decision to have the country's cheaper brands, which were
once made throughout the industry, located in Radom and Krakow. Plants
in Krakow, Poznan and Lodz are the other three producers currently on
offer.

This decision means that Radom's market share will rise to around 24
per cent, according to a text in the Rzeczpospolita newspaper written
by the head of Burston Marsteller, a PR company retained by Philip
Morris which is bidding for Krakow. Krakow will also see its pre
allocation share of 35 per cent rise slightly although its expected net
profit of $26 million for 1995 is expected to fall to $24 million as a
result of the decision. The greatest loser, however, is Poznan whose
28.5 per cent market share will be hit and whose pre-allocation net
profit of $9.2 million will fall to around $6.4 million. Reemstma of
Germany is thought to be interested in taking Poznan over.

So far the government has judged offers for the three remaining plants
from bidders such as Philip Morris and Reemstma to be inadequate.
However the Burston Marsteller text would suggest that Philip Morris
values the Krakow works at between $286 million and $327 million and
thus would be willing to pay around $200 million for a 65 per cent
stake. The same text, written before the Radom deal was struck with
Seita, valued the Radom works at between $83 million and $78 million
while the price Seita paid valued the works at $98 million. This
suggests that the government will try to hold out to get PM to improve
its offer by around 10 to 15 per cent.

IMF DEAL IN SIGHT, BUDGET PASSED

Hungary reached the basis of an IMF agreement on a much-delayed 18-
month stand-by loan at the end of a mission in mid-December.

However - much to the anger of the trade unions and social security
officials - the agreement is conditional on parliament's passing
satisfactory budgets for the two state social security funds which
handle health and pensions payments. Parliament is not expected to pass
the budgets of the semi-independent funds before late February.

The unions and fund administrators say they are being blackmailed into
agreeing with finance ministry suggestions for the 1996 fund budgets as
otherwise they will be blamed for scuppering the IMF deal. Economists
say the IMF's condition should at least encourage an early solution to
what has been a highly contentious issue. The funds and the finance
ministry have been locked in discussions over spending plans for 1996
for some time.

Leslie Lipsitz, head of the mission, said the government and IMF had
agreed on the key economic targets until end-1997 and that he was very
hopeful an agreement could be reached and approved early next year. He
said another mission would not be necessary and that the loan could go
to board approval within a couple of weeks of parliament passing the
social security budgets.

Ever since a Socialist-led coalition took office in July 1994, Hungary
has been keen to secure an IMF stand-by to boost its standing on
international markets and with foreign investors. Central banks
officials have said that Hungary, which recently repaid some of its
earlier IMF loans ahead of schedule, may not even draw on the present
planned stand-by likely to be worth $300 million.

Lipsitz said Hungary aimed to bring down inflation to 20 per cent by
the end of 1996 and to 15 per cent by late 1997. GDP is forecasted to
rise by 2-3 per cent this year and by more than 3 per cent from 1997
onwards, up from an estimated 2 per cent in 1995. The budget deficit
for this year is put at 4 per cent and is due to fall to 3 per cent
next year. The target current account for this year is $2 billion and
is due to fall to $1.5 billion in 1997, down from more than $2.5
billion in 1995 and $3.9 billion in 1994.

MATAV RAISES A FURTHER $852M

After months of often difficult negotiations, Ameritech, the US
regional operator, and Deutsche Telekom have succeeded in their quest
to purchase a majority stake in Matav, Hungary's telecoms operator in
which they had held a minority cent stake since 1993. Matav becomes the
first national telecoms operator in the region to pass to majority
foreign ownership.

In late December, Magyarcom, the consortium formed by the two companies
two years ago, agreed to pay $852 million for a further 37 per cent of
Matav, bringing their total stake to around 67 per cent. The sale,
together with the US-German consortium's purchase of a 30.3 per cent
stake for $875 million in December 1993, is the region's largest
privatization to date and the largest foreign investment in Hungary.

However, the deal - the culmination of a spate of year-end sales by APV
Rt, the state privatization agency - nearly fell through at the last
minute. Ron Sommer, chairman of Deutsche Telekom's management board,
and Walter Catlow, Ameritech vice-president, flew into Budapest to sign
the purchase contract only to run into an eleventh-hour hitch requiring
further negotiations. The deal was finally clinched after delays of
several hours.

Sources said the Hungarian side failed to include all the consortium's
contractual rights in the purchase document and also sought guarantees
that Magyarcom would not exit its investment within a fixed period of
time.

APV Rt said the consortium, in which Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom
have equal shares, had undertaken to float the company and reduce its
stake from 67 per cent to 50 per cent plus one vote by the end of the
century.

The state is due to retain a 25 per cent plus one stake in Matav, one
of Hungary's leading blue chip companies, while management and
employees are to be offered up to 2.7 per cent. Hungary was advised on
the sale by CS First Boston.

In the summer, when Hungary appointed CSFB as adviser, most analysts
doubted Hungary would sell a majority stake to Magyarcom. State
officials also indicated they would prefer to bring in institutional
investors and float the company in line with a government policy to
boost the Budapest Stock Exchange through privatization when possible.

But the consortium consistently argued against an early public offer on
the grounds that the company would fetch more once it had completed a
three-year Ft 210 billion ($1.5 billion) investment and restructuring
plan begun last year. An offer at a lower price than the consortium
paid would also have forced Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom to write
down their investments at a loss.

Magyarcom also wished to have full control of the company. Although it
gained significant management control in 1993, including a power of
veto over some decisions, it frequently had to spend much time
negotiating issues with its Hungarian partners. It took several months,
for example, for the two sides to agree on a new managing director in
early 1995.

At the signing ceremony, Sommer said the consortium was committed to
developing further Hungary's telecoms infrastructure and to making
Matav, the region's leading telecoms company. As part of its successful
bid in 1993, the consortium agreed to make Matav an international
telecoms hub and to increase the number of telephone lines by 15.5 per
cent annually - a target it exceeded by some eight percentage points in
1995.

Matav has a monopoly on national long-distance and international calls
until 2001 and will also be the exclusive operator in 39 out of 54
local network regions during this time. In addition, it has majority
stakes in two out of three local mobile telephone companies.

Catlow said the company had decided to increase its stake in Matav as
the Hungarian telecoms sector was the most attractive for investment in
the region. Ameritech is in dispute with the Polish government which it
alleges has reneged on a promise to grant it a digital mobile telephone
licence.

SERVIER ACQUIRES MAJORITY OF EGIS

Servier, the privately-held French pharmaceuticals company, formed a
strategic alliance with and acquired a 51 per cent stake in Egis, one
of Hungary's leading pharmaceuticals producers, in late December.
Servier, France's third largest pharmaceutical supplier, acquired 30
per cent of the company from the EBRD and the balance from NatWest
Securities.

The purchase price was not disclosed. However, the company's market
capitalization at the end of trading on December 15, the last day
before the purchase, was $184 million. Peter Reiniger, joint head of
the EBRD's Hungary team, told FEE  that the bank, which paid $45
million for its stake in late 1993, had made a profit on the
transaction. He said the value of the deal reflected the company's
share price as well as a premium for the purchase of a controlling
stake.

Egis, Hungary's second largest pharmaceutical company after Richter
Gedeon, was the leader on the local market in 1994 with a 13 per cent
market share. Exports accounted for 44 per cent of total sales. The
company, which went public in June 1994, made a profit of Ft3.8 billion
($31 million) on turnover of Ft14.4 billion in the first nine months of
1995.

Last summer the state's remaining 28 per cent stake in Egis was sold to
NatWest Securities at a price of Ft2,550 a share, compared to Ft3,275
in December, making the company the first of the country's large
pharmaceutical companies to become 100 per cent private.

The sale to NatWest, however, caused considerable controversy after it
emerged that the EBRD had urged the government to sell its shares to
NatWest - whose corporate finance division had been appointed to advise
on the sale - rather than to rivals including CS First Boston.

Brokers say the sale to NatWest without a proper tender for the shares
was in contravention of Hungary's new privatization law, passed last
May. However, the EBRD insisted on the sale to a "friendly party" on
the grounds that its 30 per cent stake would be worth less unless sold
in tandem with the government's remaining stake. EBRD officials told
FEE they had initially urged the government to sell its stake later
once a strategic partner had been found but that APV, anxious to raise
privatization revenues, had insisted on divesting its stake in the
summer. Only then had the EBRD stepped in and ensured the two stakes
could still be sold together.

The sale is one of only two "exits" made by the EBRD - earlier in
December it sold on its stake in a Czech chocolate maker. Officials
said the two sales reflected the growing maturity and stability in
Hungary and the Czech Republic and were also textbook examples of the
role the bank was set up to play. In both cases the bank got involved
in the companies' privatizations, acting as a "bridge" between the
state and private buyers.

Analysts said the sale also reflected Hungary's leading role in the
regional pharmaceuticals industry. The deal came only days after the
launch of a $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a medium-sized private
drugs producer (see following article), and just weeks after the sale
of 78 per cent of Biogal, another former state-owned pharmaceutical
company, to Teva of Israel for $26 million (FEE 5:22). Sanofi of France
owns a majority stake in Chinoin while Richter Gedeon has been floated
(FEE 5:22) and is now majority-owned by institutional and local
investors.

The Egis acquisition is Servier's first in central and eastern Europe.
Servier officials said they had negotiated the purchase in just six
weeks and had not yet decided whether they would increase their stake
further.

BRISTOL-MYERS LAUNCHES OFFER FOR PHARMAVIT

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), the US pharmaceuticals giant, has launched
a $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a rapidly expanding local
pharmaceutical company, set up in 1988. The offer, which is for 100 per
cent of the company, is Hungary's first public takeover of a company
listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange and one of the first such
takeovers in the region.

BMS said it had already reached agreement to buy 77 per cent of the
company from its majority owners Dr Imre Somody, Pharmavit chief
executive and founder, and Genericon Pharma, an Austrian
pharmaceuticals company. Its offer to both majority and minority
shareholders is to be at the same price even though Hungary has few
regulations governing takeovers and ensuring minority shareholder
protection.

BMS has offered $62.35 per share or $12.47 per global depository share,
each representing one fifth of a share - a significant premium over the
company's stock market price. GDSs were trading at $7.25 in the London
OTC market the day before the offer was announced in December, down
from an offer price of $57.5 when the company went public in June 1994.

BMS said its offer which closes on January 26 was conditional on it
gaining 90 per cent of Pharmavit and that it intended to withdraw the
company from the BSE. The vast majority of the 23 per cent stake not
owned by the majority shareholders is held by foreign institutional
investors.

BMS is being advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK investment bank,
together with Creditanstalt Securities Budapest - the same team which
this year advised on the flotation of OTP, the national savings bank,
and on the placement of a further tranche of Richter Gedeon, Hungary's
largest pharmaceuticals company.

Pharmavit made pre-tax profit of Ft632 million ($5.7 million) on
turnover of Ft4.1 billion in 1994, up from Ft533 million on turnover of
Ft2.4 billion in 1993. It is Hungary's leading producer of vitamin
pills - mainly through its Plussz effervescent tables. Most of its
sales are in Hungary but the company also has sales subsidiaries in the
Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.

The company is one of a growing breed of eastern European companies,
set up at the beginning of market-led changes, which are now
sufficiently mature to attract the interest of a multinational company.

Since 1990 the company has also produced generic drugs and over-the-
counter medicines. Its main pharmaceutical product is Diclofenac, an
anti-inflammatory drug developed by Ciba-Geigy.

Before setting up Pharmavit, Somody, 37, was a director at Chinoin, the
local drugs company now owned by Sanofi of France. He will stay on as
head of BSM in Hungary - although Pharmavit is to retain its
independence. BSM intends to use Pharmavit, its first acquisition in
the central and eastern Europe, to expand further in the region.

Somody recommended that minority shareholders accept the offer. He
apologised for the company's change of strategy - Pharmavit had
previously indicated it would not seek a strategic partner - but said
BSM's offer was a good one.

GE CAPITAL, EBRD ACQUIRE BUDAPEST BANK

GE Capital, the financial services division of General Electric of the
US, and the EBRD have together acquired a 60 per cent stake in Budapest
Bank for $87 million, ending the bank's three years on the sale block.

Like Matav, however, the sale suffered a number of last minute hitches
as both sides rushed to meet a December 15 deadline. The deadline was
set in late 1994 when the government agreed to transfer Ft12 billion in
state securities to the bank - to make it more attractive ahead of
privatization - on condition it was sold by December 15 1995. In the
end, the deadline had to be extended for two weeks while the deal was
finalized. Senior GE and EBRD officials, including Christopher
MacKenzie, GE Capital's chief executive in Europe, flew into Budapest
with the expectations that a deal would be signed by the 15th only to
leave empty-handed. A technical hitch appeared which could only be
resolved by finance minister Lajos Bokros, who was away at the time. It
appears that liability for at least one court case involving Budapest
Bank had not been fully resolved in the sales contract, causing a three-
day delay in the signing.

Under the terms of the agreement, GE Capital, which will take a 27.5
per cent stake, will assume operational control of the bank. Together
with the EBRD, which has a 32.5 per cent, GE has an option to increase
its stake by 22 per cent within five and a half years. Until the sale
the state held an 82.6 per cent stake in the bank.

Hungary was advised on the sale jointly by Salomon Brothers and Lehman
Brothers. Salomon initially won the adviser's contract but was obliged
to share it with Lehman after much of its banking team left to join
Lehman.

The sale is a significant boost to government efforts to sell off state
banks, many of which have borne the brunt of the country's difficult
post-communist transition and have proved hard to privatize. The deal
is only Hungary's second sale of a large commercial bank to a Western
strategic partner. It follows the sale of a 25 per cent plus one vote
stake in Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank, the foreign trade bank, to
Bayerische Landesbank in mid-1994.

GE Capital, which is expanding aggressively into Europe through a
string of recent acquisitions, entered the bidding for Budapest Bank,
Hungary's fifth largest commercial bank, relatively late. It was not
one of the three companies which tendered for the bank in late 1994.
Then, Credit Suisse was named preferred bidder ahead of ING and Allied
Irish, only to withdraw abruptly in March after conducting due
diligence.

GE Capital and the EBRD signed a letter of intent to purchase the bank
in October and subsequently conducted due diligence. The buyers are
understood to have initially offered around $100 million but scaled
back their offer to $87 million after due diligence. Like other banks,
Budapest Bank has suffered from bad loans and in the middle of last
year had to make 15 per cent risk provisions. The bank has assets of
around Ft215 billion and 74 branches.

GE Capital, whose parent company is one of the biggest investors in
Hungary, said it would bring in new financial products and modern
technology. It is expected to keep on Bela Singlovics, the bank's chief
executive.

POLITICAL FEARS KEEP INVESTORS AWAY DESPITE BOOMING ECONOMY

For 1995, Slovakia should achieve the second-highest growth rate among
east Europe's emerging markets behind Albania, with gross domestic
product rising by 6 per cent. Economists expect a similar growth rate
in 1996 as key industries such as chemicals and steel continue to
benefit from booming export markets and as domestic demand grows.

Whether this rosy scenario leads to a reassessment of the country by
domestic and foreign investors will depend crucially on whether the
prime minister, Vladimir Meciar, is prepared to settle his damaging
constitutional row with President Michal Kovac. It is this power
struggle more than anything that has caused Slovakia to lag behind its
peers in the Visegrad group of countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland - in the eyes of foreign observers, to the detriment of its
reputation abroad.

There appears to be little likelihood of an early reconciliation, and
diplomats in Bratislava say they can see no way out of the deadlock.
"Meciar must make the first move, and he does not appear willing to do
so," one diplomat said before Christmas. Until he does, the diplomat
adds, Slovakia will remain in limbo.

So far, however, the political row has not had an adverse impact on the
economy. Indeed, there is much progress on all fronts, including
privatization, which has speeded up considerably since the government
abandoned coupon sell-offs early in 1995 and replaced them with an ad
hoc series of sales to a narrow group of owner/managers. The key
question in 1996, as privatization reaches a climax, is: What next?

There were good reasons for abandoning coupon privatization. It is slow
and can be an administrative nightmare. It results in widely dispersed
ownership and to be truly successful it requires the immediate
implementation of rules to protect small investors (which are not yet
forthcoming in, for example, the Czech Republic).

On the other hand, it has a measure of transparency and fairness in
that all adult citizens can participate, making it politically popular.

The government's main argument for abandoning the coupon plan was that
dispersed shareholdings meant there was no clearly identified owner.
There was also the unstated fear among the nationalists that the back
door would be opened to foreign investors to pick up assets on the
cheap.

Critics argued that these were excuses for abandoning privatization
altogether. In fact, the reverse has happened. The adoption of
"standard methods" of privatization has quickened the pace
considerably, with hundreds of sell-offs in the second half of this
year with an estimated book value of $1 billion.  These range from
small factories to a big chunk of the Slovnaft petrochemical group .

The speed of the sell-offs is admirable. About 65 per cent of gross
domestic product is now generated by the private sector, according to
official estimates. The vast majority of these sales have been made to
executives and workers at the enterprises involved.

Meciar defends the methods used to reduce state ownership: "Various
lobbies say our methods are undemocratic. We think they are necessary
and inevitable," he says.

Yet there are clear signs of a wider agenda in the current bout of
privatization fever. Assets are often sold at knock-down prices and
buyers have 10 years to pay for them. If the enterprise is deemed
important enough, a controversial and ambiguous law on strategic
enterprises enables the state to retain a golden share that allows it
to wield influence long after the stake has been sold.

Most contentiously, critics say assets are sold only to those deemed
loyal to Meciar's all-embracing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.

Eugen Jurzyca of the Centre for Economic Development, a think tank,
doubts the wisdom of what he terms "family circle privatization".
Selling companies on the cheap throws away money that could be used for
social spending and the relief of bad debts. It also promotes
inequality by concentrating potentially valuable assets among a narrow
group who can then sell them on at great profit to themselves.

There is also growing concern about how these assets are being paid
for, in a country chronically short of capital. Those managers who buy
the stakes will owe substantial sums to the state holding company, the
National Property Fund (NPF), over the 10-year period of the payment.
The fear is that company cash flow will be diverted in the form of
dividends to owners to make those payments.

Few Slovak companies have the cash flow to afford this. "The company is
paying for its own acquisition in the end," notes Jean-Christophe Ganz,
manager of ING Bank in Bratislava.

Economists play down the political dimension of privatization. For the
National Bank of Slovakia the important thing is that it is continuing,
says Elena Kohutikova, head of the independent central bank's monetary
policy unit. "It is difficult to decide which privatization policy is
the best one," she says.

So far the government's policy has not had an adverse impact on
inflation, but nor has it enabled substantial inflows of fresh capital
and know-how. This raises two further questions. The first is how the
cost of the bond issue will be met.

Each coupon holder is to receive a nominal Sk 10,000 ($345) bond backed
by the assets of the NPF. The bonds can be used for things like paying
for an apartment or contributing to a private pension scheme, requiring
early redemption, and they are also likely to be transferable.

The bonds are due to mature in 2001, requiring the NPF to have up to Sk
35 billion ($1.2 billion) available to pay out. Meantime there is
annual interest based on the discount rate (currently 9.75 per cent).
Although not all holders are expected to retain the bonds to maturity,
economists warn that the potential cost of the scheme could be as high
as Sk 50 billion ($1.7 billion). This is a giant mortgage on the NPF
that it must be able to discharge.

The second question is how industry will be restructured. Key companies
like Slovnaft and the big VSZ steel plant have largely modernized and
are helping to fuel economic growth. Many others await the kiss of
life.

Foreign investment is one obvious solution, and some observers expect a
push to attract it in 1996. This would be a volte face for the
government, but one that Meciar may be pragmatic enough to pull off.

POWER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURED

The EBRD is backing Ukraine's power sector with a loan of $61.9 million
to support the restructuring of the country's power sector. Following
an EU and UK Know-How-Fund commissioned study on Ukraine's power
industry, the government is set to re-organize the thermal power
sector, to include the creation of thermal generating companies,
broadly following the pattern established during the privatization of
Britain's power industry.

The loan will go to the country's four newly created thermal generating
companies to finance repair and maintenance at the largest thermal
power plants in order to improve the reliability of power generation.
The loan will also pay for more accurate meters, investments required
to start a wholesale electricity market, which is to be set up soon.
Funds will also pay for managerial assistance to provide modern
accountancy measures and financial management techniques.

The loan was signed during President Leonid Kuchma's official visit to
London in December, when the EBRD signed a total of $75 million in
funding to Ukrainian enterprises. In view of the continued operation of
the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which Western experts unanimously
want closed down, it is a top priority to help provide a more reliable
power industry to replace the Chernobyl plant.

"Perhaps the most urgent issue for Ukraine today concerns the country's
energy sector," said Kuchma during his London visit. "With the EBRD's
loan we can strengthen our existing resources, in this case thermal
power plants."

In the longer term, the project will include a "twinning" programme for
management with a Western power company. The actual company has yet to
be chosen.

$50M AGREEMENT SIGNED

President Kuchma's London visit saw the signing of an important project
aimed to grease the wheels of trade in Ukraine. The EBRD has signed a
$50 million trade finance agreement under which it will guarantee the
payments of participating Ukrainian banks to their foreign
correspondent banks. The Ukrainian Innovation Bank (Ukrinbank), a
private bank, is the first to sign up to the programme. Other banks are
expected to join the programme shortly.

The programme was first started in Russian and Macedonia. Day-to-day
trade is stifled by a chronic shortage of trade finance, covering both
exports and imports from the East European countries. Under the
programme, the EBRD guarantees six-month letters of credit issued by
selected financial institutions. This guarantee allows banks to
establish reliable reputations with Western financial institutions,
enabling them to adopt normal correspondent relations with banks in
Eastern Europe. The programme may be expanded later to cover banks in
Eastern Europe and in "lost" markets, such as India, where Ukrainian
enterprises used to export five years ago.

Under the programme, the Ukrainian bank informs the EBRD which foreign
bank it wants to deal with and pays the EBRD a fee to cover the
guarantee. The EBRD guarantees up to 80 per cent of the letter of
credit thus allowing importers and exporters to get out of the current
stalemate and re-establish trade on a normal footing.

EBRD INCREASES UKRAINE FUND CAPITAL

The EBRD is backing equity funding by increasing the capital base of
the Ukraine Fund, the first private venture funds to be established in
Ukraine. Set up two years ago, the fund has lent $5 million to 18
companies. The EBRD will now increase its capital base by a further
$6.5 million. Equity funding has been provided to companies
manufacturing medical equipment, construction materials and food
processing and distribution.

The fund was established with a group of international investors,
including Bank of Boston and Claflin Capital Management. Despite the
difficult economic conditions, the Fund was oversubscribed and
initially raised $12 million as against a target of $10 million.

The EBRD is backing further infrastructure investment with an
investment of $5 million to assist in the construction of a fertilizer
terminal, Transinvestservice at Odessa. The terminal is part-owned by
the Ukrainian State Property Fund, the Norwegian company, Norsk Hydro
as well as local investors. The terminal will be used mainly for the
export of fertilizers from Ukraine and other CIS countries to Latin
America and Asia.

These investments bring the value of signed commitments to a total of
about $312 million for this year. EBRD president Jacques de LarosiAre
noted that the bank is able to achieve this due to the improved macro-
economic situation in the country and the growth of the private sector.
This total compares favourably with the EBRD projects approved in 1994,
when Ecu 153.9 million was committed in only three projects.

TACIS FUNDS THREATENED

Technical assistance programmes to the CIS countries are under threat
following a top-level move to block funding from the European Union.
Spain is demanding tougher controls and greater participation in
awarding contracts under the TACIS programme, which funds technical
assistance programmes to the 12 CIS member countries.

No agreement has been reached to authorize the TACIS budget of Ecu 500
million for 1996. While this dispute will not stop the programme in its
tracks, unless there is a resolution soon, the effects will be felt in
the future.

"We have the legal base to operate by extending the present regulations
for one year, but the budget is unclear," said EU official, Per Winter.

Although TACIS officials agree on financial commitments within each
budgetary year, which runs to December 31, the drawdown period can
extend for up to three years. Winter added that there is always a rush
to complete commitments by the end of the year in order to spend the
full annual allocation. If there is agreement within the first few
months of 1996, then officials are confident that the programme will be
able to fulfil commitments for the year. Funding for the programme will
be discussed again early in 1996, when it is hoped that Spain and other
possible allies might be persuaded to authorize a budget.

Spain is objecting to the way TACIS is run, mainly because so far
Spanish companies have only won 2 per cent of the programme's
contracts. EU officials claim they have tried to interest Spanish
companies in the programme, but with little success. They point out
that Spain scoops the pool in Latin America, but have little experience
or language skills in Eastern Europe. Spain wants to introduce a new
system of monitoring contracts and reduce the financial threshold for
contracts that are tendered, proposals resisted by other Member States,
who fear it would create a larger bureaucracy and lead to delays.

The TACIS programme had earlier been attacked by the European Court of
Auditors for inefficiency and poor targeting of funds, criticism that
the PHARE programme, aimed at the Central European countries had
earlier suffered. PHARE has been re-drafted, changed its bureaucratic
structure and focus to enable it to prepare the Central European
countries for joining the EU.

At the Cannes meeting in June, the EU decided to change the funding
mechanism for PHARE from an annual budget system to a five-year budget
of Ecu 6.7 billion, to avoid the annual scramble to commit funds by the
end of the year. The civil service oversight was also changed from a
sectoral to a country basis. There are now country desks and these
officials hold monthly meetings in the countries' capitals to determine
the future programmes in agreement with the individual governments.

Contracts under the PHARE programme have also changed from a series of
technical assistance contracts to a cohesive pre-accession strategy.
There are three main strands of the PHARE strategy.

The primary aim is devoted to helping the countries prepare for
membership of the EU. Each country has to work out a programme of
action that includes passing new legislation, preparing and ensuring
its enforcement and introducing European technical norms and standards.
While the programmes are driven by the individual countries, if EU
officials feel that the programmes do not make a realistic contribution
to EU integration, then they can reduce the funds available.

The second priority for PHARE funding is for infrastructure in areas
such as telecommunications, environment, gass and electricity networks
and road and rail transport. In transport, the EU has designated Trans-
European Networks, which integrate Central Europe's roads and railways
with existing networks in Western Europe and in particular easing
bottlenecks at border crossings.

 PHARE has now expanded into also providing finance in order to
catalyse foreign investments. Typically this might take the form of
putting up the government's share in an investment programme. The first
time this was done was two years ago, when the World Bank and the
European Investment Bank were looking to the Polish government to kick
in 10 per cent of the money needed to upgrade the E20 railway line from
Berlin to Warsaw. The Polish government re-drafted its proposed PHARE
programme to allow the money available to be spent on the railway
project.

EU officials are confident that the accession of the Central European
countries will be the best prepared of any new Member States. The
timing of their entry remains in the air, and it is also undecided
whether they will come in singly or in groups. What is certain is that
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will be the first, with
officials speculating that the likely entry date is the year 2000.
Meanwhile, Slovenia, which would also qualify for early entry, has not
signed an Association Agreement yet, because of a dispute with Italy,
while Macedonia, having solved its dispute with Greece, now qualifies
for PHARE assistance. The eligibility of the other former Yugoslav
republics remains in limbo.
