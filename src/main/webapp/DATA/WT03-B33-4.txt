JONES DIGITAL STORE OFFERS ON-LINE
SHOPPING, EDUCATION, AND INFORMATION

Denver-Based Dixon Paper Stores Market
to the Home Office On-Line

Internet browsers looking to wrangle great bargains on
interesting products and services, register for an education
course, or enter a fun contest can now gallop over to the
Jones Digital Store, a World Wide Page which uses western-
style graphics. The service has been launched by Jones Digital
Century, an Englewood, Colo.-based electronic publishing
company.

The Jones Digital Store Web Page offers several trails to
follow including Merchants: store locations; Orders, which
takes the user directly to each store's order form; More Info,
information on how to become a Jones Digital Store vendor;
Trail Mix, a list of reciprocal web links; Fun and Games, a
chance for users to enter contests; Comments, an area to ask
questions and leave comments about the service; and What's
New, for new product entries.

At http://wwwjii.com/jds/dixon, Dixon Paper Store offers 170
of its most popular laser paper products.

"We have 11 retail outlets throughout the western United
States, but going on-line will give us the opportunity to
reach the burgeoning home office market on a national levee,"
said Cynthia Scaggs, Dixons Marketing Manager for Retail
Operations. "Customers with questions can enter information
through our storefront to receive an immediate callback from a
Dixon Paper Store representative."

Currently, customers purchase items from the Jones Digital

Dr. Bernard Luskin, president of Jones Digital Century, said
"Jones Digital Store is a key element of our long-term
business strategy to provide education, entertainment and
