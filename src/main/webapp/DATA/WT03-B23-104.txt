<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
The principal aim of the Crimes Compensation Tribunal (hereafter
called CCT) is to provide an informal, compassionate and efficient
forum for victims of crime. The fulfillment of such aims, particularly
in the area of sexual assault, requires awareness and understanding
of the sensitivity of the issues involved.
<P>
The 22nd Annual Report of the Crimes Compensation Tribunal, the
Report for the year 1993/1994 states that &quot;the principal
aim of the Crimes Compensation Tribunal is to provide an informal,
compassionate and efficient forum for victims of crime&quot;.
Whilst the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act 1983 does not specifically
set out the philosophy behind the legislation it is inherent within
the specific purposes of the legislation, the informality allowed
within the Tribunal, the lack of a requirement that there be a
conviction, and the presumption that hearings shall be in private,
all point to a philosophical underpinning. This philosophical
underpinning aims to ensure that the process for obtaining Crimes
Compensation that does not re-traumatise victim /survivors of
crime but rather is an acknowledgment by the state that the victim/
survivor has experienced an injury and in addition an acknowledgment
of such injury through financial award.
<P>
In August,1993 the Magistrates' Court of Victoria in conjunction
with the Project for Legal Action Against Sexual Assault, produced
and promoted a pamphlet entitled &quot;A Message to all Victorian
Women and Children who have been subject to Sexual Assault and
other forms of Violence about Crimes Compensation in Victoria&quot;.
This pamphlet was a concerted effort to inform and encourage sexual
assault victims to apply for and receive Crimes Compensation.
The first page of the booklet states &quot;The Community has a
responsibility to protect women and children from male violence.
Where it fails to do this, compensation is the only way to acknowledge
the pain, suffering and other expenses caused by the violence
....... the Victorian community must take care of victims of crime&quot;.
<P>
In December 1994 the Victorian Community Council Against Violence
released its report for it's inquiry into services for victims
of crime, which it carried out for the Attorney General and the
Minister for Police and Associated Services. In section 2 of its
report entitled &quot;The Voice of Victims&quot; it found that
Crimes Compensation &quot;was considered to be a very crucial
component of the Criminal Justice system's response to the victims
of crime&quot;. If a respondent to the survey was satisfied with
the Crimes Compensation Tribunal process it was generally on the
basis that the Tribunal member was attentive, caring, a good listener
and helped the victim to cope. If there was dissatisfaction with
the process it was generally on the basis of opposite reasons,
namely the process was too short or the Tribunal member didn't
seem to care about the victim or could not relate to them.
<P>
In this position Paper we will highlight a number of concerns
which serve to contradict the premise that the CCT is fulfilling
its 'responsibility to protect women and children from male violence'
or to provide a 'compassionate forum' to the victim/ survivors
of crime. Some of the major concerns discussed in this paper are
as follows:
<P>
1. Attitudes expressed by Tribunal Members during cases.
<P>
2. Recent Practice Directions which serve, in numerous instances
to further traumatize victim/ survivors of crime, with for instance,
the notification of alleged offenders, the pathologising of procedures,
and a movement away from an informal environment to a more rigid
adherence to the rules and procedures of a court which can be
daunting for victim/survivors particularly, as they will be confronting
a more adversarial context.
<P>
3. An increasing tendency of victim/survivors to withdraw or avoid
making applications.
<P>
4. The conduct of the proceedings.
<P>
5. The use of uncorroborated, often highly prejudicial police
briefs.
<P>
6. The increasing use of the 'public purse' argument which often
serve to denigrate the validity of the victim / survivor's harm.
<P>
7. The issue of funding.
<P>
Since researching this paper more areas of concern have arisen.
These will be raised under the heading &quot;Other Areas of Concern&quot;
at the end of this paper.
<H3>PREPARATION OF THIS PAPER</H3>

<P>
The Federation of Community Centres and the Violence Against Women
and Children Working Group became aware of some startling experiences
of victim / survivors in the CCT and decided to make further enquiries
as a consequence. This concern was raised in a letter to the Editor
of 'The Age' on the 8th June 1995 . The Attorney General responded
in a letter of 13th June 1995 stating that we should correspond
directly with her as she had not been informed of any problems.
To establish the extent of these problems a questionnaire was
prepared by the Federation of Community Legal Centres and sent
to a number of people who work directly in the CCT field. Over
the past three months the Federation of Community Legal Centres
and the Violence Against Women and Children Working Group have
been liasing with a number of private practitioners who work at
the CCT, with CASAS, Refuges, the DVIRC, and VicSpan. These organisations
have been providing feedback on client experiences before the
CCT. The Federation has also received feedback from many of its
own caseworkers in the CCT field that underline that there are
serious problems. This paper will refer to only some of the many
cases.
<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>

<P>
The voices of women who have been raped or assaulted in their
home have been heard in increasing numbers in recent years. The
passage of the Crimes (Sexual Offenses) Act 1991, the Crimes (Rape)
Act 1991, the insertion of Section 21A of the Crimes Act which
created the crime of stalking, amendments to the Crimes (Family)
Violence Act, the adoption by the Victoria Police of a Code of
Practice for Sexual Assault and Operating Procedures in relation
to Family Violence, and the introduction of victim impact statements
have all contributed to a climate of support for victims of crime.

<P>
The Attorney-General Jan Wade in introducing Victim Impact Statements
said in June 1994
<P>
&quot;As a community we have a responsibility to respond to the
needs and concerns of victims of crime. Many victims have voiced
concern that the effect of crime on their lives has not been acknowledged
by the courts. They have expressed dissatisfaction with the way
they have been treated by the criminal justice system. The Government
recongnises that victims of crime have sometimes been neglected
in the criminal justice system......&quot;
<P>
The criminal injuries compensation scheme has been embraced by
many victims and survivors of family violence and sexual assault
as an opportunity, to inform the community about their experience
and gain acknowledgment that their lives have been significantly
effected as a result of a criminal act. For some victim/survivors
the affirmation by the Tribunal of their experience has been of
therapeutic benefit. In addition the moneys obtained by them have
enabled women:
<P>
- to obtain counseling and other therapeutic or medical treatment,
<P>
- move to a new area and re-establish herself,
<P>
- install security alarms, security doors or other safety measures
<P>
The amount received by way of pain and suffering has provided
women with a token or solatium of the community's concern. The
level of compensation has always been modest and never intended
to truly &quot;compensate&quot; the victim for their suffering.
<P>
Women who have been sexually abused or victims/survivors of violence
in the home have in recent years been encouraged to turn to this
jurisdiction and had been doing so in increasing numbers. Some
publications included comments like: :
<P>
&quot;A message to all Victorian Women and Children who have been
subject to sexual assault and other forms of Violence. About Crimes
Compensation in Victoria&quot;, written and prepared by Project
for Legal Action Against Sexual Assault and the Magistrates Court
of Victoria. This was launched in 1994 by Chief Magistrate Mr.
Nick Pappas with Mrs. Jan Wade endorsing it; and
<P>
&quot;Crimes Compensation for Survivors of Violence in the Home&quot;,
published by Coburg Brunswick Community Legal and Financial Counseling
Centre, and launched by and applauded by the Attorney General
Jan Wade and Jelena Popovic.
<P>
This jurisdiction however, is set to fail victim/ survivors of
sexual assault and family violence unless the legislation is changed
and many of the practices of the Tribunal urgently addressed.
Any progress that has been made by the legal system to respond
to the concerns of victims will otherwise be eroded. Of particular
concern are:
<P>
1. The Tribunal's move to the Magistrates' Court;
<P>
2. Narrow and restrictive interpretations of the legislation inconsistent
with the spirit of the Act;
<P>
3. Undue emphasis on the medicalisation of the impact of sexual
abuse and violence in the home on women and children that demonstrate
a lack of understanding of such issues and
<P>
4. Increased use of section 7(7) and section 13 of the Act pursuant
to a recent Practice direction issued by the Chief Magistrate,
involving the calling of alleged offenders and the creating of
an adversarial forum.
<OL>
<LI><B>RECOMMENDATION:<BR>
</B>
</OL>

<P>
<B>THAT PRACTICES OF THE CCT NEED TO BE URGENTLY ADDRESSED SO
THAT THEY RESPOND TO THE NEEDS OF VICTIM/SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.
</B>
<P>
Allegations of violence in the home and sexual assault where the
offender is known to the victim/survivor are not easily made.
Victims/survivors who do proceed with public disclosure of the
abuse face: 
<P>
1. Fear of retribution by the offender or his family or friends
<P>
2. Disbelief by family, friends, police, juries and the community
<P>
3. Associations of guilt, e.g. she should never have gone back
to him; she lead him on; 
<P>
4. Shame - feelings of shame for self and other family members.

<P>
5. Loss of family and friends because of division of support between
the victim and the offender
<P>
6. Displacement because of all of the above and the need to move
away
<P>
7. Further trauma through her involvement as a &quot;witness&quot;
in the criminal justice system.
<P>
People who work with women who are victims and survivors of violence
see first hand the further victimisation these individuals face
in the criminal justice system, the Family Court system and the
civil jurisdiction. In the criminal justice system the benefit
of doubt lies with the accused and strict rules of evidence sometimes
prevent juries from hearing the full story. In the Family Court,
in relation to access and custody, the welfare of children is
the paramount concern. Where allegations of violence are made
the court only has to consider these allegations and make findings
in relation to them where the &quot;best interests of the children&quot;
require that this be done. Issues of violence and fault are not
relevant to property and divorce proceedings In the civil jurisdiction
limitation periods, costs and unenforceable judgments mitigate
against victims taking such action. 
<P>
Violence against women is a crime and a violation of a woman's
fundamental human right. The crimes compensation scheme is an
opportunity for the community to redress the disadvantage women
who are victims/survivors of criminal acts currently face within
the legal system. As a Tribunal interpreting and implementing
remedial legislation, it is our view that the scheme should be
administered in a way that promotes justice for victims. The spirit
of the legislation requires that in this jurisdiction the interests
of victims/survivors be put ahead of any need to protect the perceived
rights or interests of alleged offenders.
<P>
<B>2. RECOMMENDATION: <BR>
<BR>
<B>THAT CCT BE ADMINISTERED IN A WAY WHICH PROMOTES JUSTICE FOR
VICTIM/SURVIVORS.</B></B>
<P>
Many women that we see at Community Legal Centres choose not to
pursue a legal course of action. Reasons for this include fear
of retribution, guilt, shame, disruption and division caused to
families. The recent practice directions issued by the Tribunal
in relation to the notification of offenders pursuant to section
7 of the Act and the consequent opportunity of the alleged offender
to attend the hearing of the application , cross-examine witnesses
and have access to documents filed by the applicant including
medical reports, will again &quot;silence&quot; victims and survivors
of sexual assault and violence in the home. 
<P>
21 year old Marie (not her real name) made an application for
compensation for the multiple counts of rape she suffered as a
child by her older brother. Marie had disclosed the abuse to her
parents as a young child. The brother was banished from the family
and she was told not to tell anyone. Marie's brother returned
home several years later and she found it difficult to cope with
the distress and anxiety his presence caused. Marie secretly sought
help from counselors at the Centre Against Sexual Assault. Marie
has continued with counseling and has made an application for
compensation. She is unable to tell her parents about the counseling
or her application. She is now unable to proceed with the charges
against her brother. She could not cope with the responsibility
of again dividing her family, making her brother homeless and
vulnerable and disclosing the &quot;family secret&quot; and so
bringing shame to the family. Marie will not proceed with her
application for compensation if the Tribunal elect to notify her
brother or her parents of the application.
<P>
The Practice Directions reflect a regressive return to an outdated
belief that a woman's uncorroborated allegation of assault should
be treated with extreme caution. Justice Deane of the High Court
in 1989 acknowledged that charges of sexual offenses are not &quot;easily
made&quot; - the humiliation and embarrassment that so wrongly
falls upon victims and survivors is so extreme as to militate
against the making of many complaints. He added that such complaints
were however &quot;not hard to defend&quot;. (The Voice of the
Rapist, J. Scutt, page 38). Indeed research conducted by the Victorian
Law Reform Commission showed that in 1988-89 less than half of
those offenders charged were convicted of a rape offense. In a
third of cases, offenders were convicted of some lesser offense.
Thirty-four percent of people committed for trial by jury for
rape were not convicted of any offense. In addition, Victoria
Police statistics show that charges are laid against an offender
in approximately one third of incidents where a rape has been
reported. (page 5 Rape Law Reform Evaluation Project: Report No
1) 
<H3>RECENT PRACTICE DIRECTIONS</H3>

<P>
The Practice Direction issued by Nicholas Pappas, Chief Magistrate,
4th May 1995, provides as follows:
<P>
1. In certain circumstances the Tribunal may consider it appropriate
to give notification to &quot;any person who, in the opinion of
the Tribunal has or may have an interest in the determination
of the application&quot;.
<P>
2. The Tribunal will generally give notice only in the following
circumstances:-
<P>
(i) The identity of the alleged offender is known or can be established;
and/or
<P>
(ii) No Police charges have been laid either at the insistence
of the Applicant or because of a decision by the police or DPP
not to do so;
<P>
(iii) The Applicant's claim, on a reading of the file material
is not strong and another version of events unfavorable to the
Applicant is reasonably open; and/or
<P>
(iv) As a matter of fairness the alleged offender should be notified
of the application (see Smith's case A.A.T. 93/3780)
<P>
3. Where a Tribunal Member determines that notification should
be given to the alleged offender of the allegations made against
him/her, the following procedure will apply:
<P>
(i) The Tribunal will write to the Applicant or Applicant's solicitor
if there is a solicitor on the record advising of the decision
to notify the alleged offender pursuant to s7(7).
<P>
(ii) Fourteen days later the Tribunal will then forward by certified
mail a brief letter to the alleged offender setting out the nature
of the allegations and asking the alleged offender to advise within
14 days of the date of the letter whether he/she wishes to be:-
<P>
* advised of the hearing date of the application so that he/she
may attend the hearing and
<P>
* represented by Counsel at the hearing
<P>
(iii) An alleged offender has 14 days from the date of the certified
letter to reply. If no reply is received the matter is set down
for hearing. The Applicant is notified of the failure of the alleged
offender to respond to the Tribunal's notice of the allegations
made against him/her
<P>
(iv) If a reply is received the Applicant is notified of the alleged
offender's intention to appear. The Applicant is then requested
to advise the number and type of the witnesses the applicant may
call and give an estimate of hearing time and advise if the Applicant
wishes to use the Remote Witness facility at the Tribunal Court.
<P>
(v) The Registrar of the Tribunal will arrange for a Protective
Security officer to be present at the hearing in appropriate circumstances.
<P>
4. It is anticipated that Notice pursuant to s. 7(7) of the Act
will be given only to a limited number and class of persons. Generally
there should be sufficient material on the Tribunal file for a
Tribunal Member to make a determination on the material without
involving any hearing as to whether or not on the balance of probabilities
a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment has been committed
against the Applicant.
<P>
5. If an alleged offender elects to attend the hearing of the
application the Tribunal will:-
<P>
* notify the alleged offender of the date and place of the hearing;
and
<P>
* make available to the alleged offender a copy of the application
together with a copy of any statement made by the applicant setting
out the allegations made against the alleged offender.
<P>
An alleged offender or his/her legal representative will have
the right to peruse any police file in the possession of the Tribunal
as does the Applicant but will not be permitted to make photocopies
of any of the material contained in the police brief. The principles
of legal/medical privilege applicable in the civil law apply to
all material contained in the Tribunal's file.
<P>
6. The Tribunal will in accordance with S. 13(1)(a) of the Criminal
Injuries Compensation Act 1983 hear and determine the application
expeditiously and informally and &quot;having regard to the requirements
of justice and without regard to legal forms and solemnities,
and may act without observing legal rules relating to evidence
and procedure&quot;
<H3>THE DECISION TO NOTIFY AN ALLEGED OFFENDER</H3>

<P>
There is uncertainty and inconsistency between Tribunals as to
when and if the Practice Directions will be followed. Some Tribunals
are using the Tribunal's power to subpoena the alleged offender
rather than notifying the alleged offender pursuant to section
7(7). A trend toward notification is occurring in almost all cases
of family violence where the matter has not proceeded to charges
being laid and all cases of sexual assault where the alleged offender
is known to the Applicant.
<P>
It was the case of Smith that prompted the Crimes Compensation
Tribunal to issue this Practice Direction. The facts of Smith
however ,should be carefully considered whenever it is being used
as a precedent for notification. In this case the Applicant was
a very young child. Evidence of the alleged abuse therefore came
from third parties. In addition, there had been a very long and
acrimonious dispute between the child's parents in relation to
access and the abuse had been denied by the father. This should
be distinguished from applications made by adults who can give
personal accounts of the crime and subsequent trauma.
<P>
Given the nature of an application for compensation and particularly
a claim for compensation arising out of an incident where the
offender is known to the victim, any decision to notify an alleged
offender or any other person of the application must be exercised
with extreme caution. (see Smith v CCT, No. 93/13780, page 5)
<P>
<B>3. RECOMMENDATION: <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>A DECISION TO NOTIFY AN ALLEGED OFFENDER SHOULD BE USED RARELY AND SHOULD ONLY OCCUR IN EXCEPTIONAL OR EXTREME
CIRCUMSTANCES..</FONT></B></B>
<P>
In his Practice Directions, the Chief Magistrate states:
<P>
&quot;it is anticipated that Notice pursuant to s.7(7) of the
Act will be given only to a limited number and class of persons.
Generally there should be sufficient material on the Tribunal
file for a Tribunal Member to make a determination on the material
without involving any hearing as to whether or not on the balance
of probabilities a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment
has been committed against the Applicant&quot;
<P>
Despite the caution expressed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal
and the Chief Magistrate, it is becoming clear that in almost
all cases of assault in the home or sexual assault where the offender
is known to the applicant and where charges have not been laid,
the alleged offender is being notified. 
<P>
A.. applied for compensation for injuries suffered by her when
she was physically assaulted by her husband . A alleged that she
was punched in the chest, thrown to the floor, strangled and shaken
by the offender. The alleged offender panicked and rang the police
after the applicant &quot;blacked out&quot; The offender accompanied
the applicant to the hospital where injuries consistent with the
her version of the assault were observed and recorded. The police
attended the hospital and it was recorded by the attending police
officers on the Patrol Duty Record that the offender admitted
to police that he assaulted the applicant. The applicant made
a written statement in which she said that she did not want any
further action taken against her husband. In her application to
the Tribunal the applicant alleged that the alleged offender had
threatened to kill her if she had charges laid against him. The
police did not take a statement from the offender or lay any charges.
The applicant left the matrimonial home that evening and the parties
have remained separated. Although not notified pursuant to section
7(7) the alleged offender was subpoenaed to attend the hearing.

<P>
The above case illustrates that since the issue of the Practice
Direction, the Tribunal appears to be reluctant to determine applications
without having first notified the offender of the allegations
against him and giving him an opportunity to be heard. Section
21 of the Act expressly allows the Tribunal to make an Award whether
or not a person is prosecuted for or convicted of an offense.
Prior to the issue of these practice directions, notification
of the offender and/or his involvement in the hearing rarely occurred.
The Tribunal have heard and determined many applications by victims
where crimes had not been reported, charges had not been laid
or convictions had not been achieved. 
<P>
The Tribunal also appear to have little or no sensitivity or understanding
of the physical or psychological danger that victims are put under
or perceive themselves to be in when a decision is made to notify
an alleged offender. The decision can subject the victim/survivors
to physical danger and cause considerable fear, stress and anxiety
to the applicant. Many applicants have been threatened by the
offender with retribution or an escalation of violence if the
victim\survivor reports the assault. Whilst protections such as
remote witness facilities and security guards are offered at the
Tribunal on the hearing day no protection or security is offered
to victims/survivors between the date of notification or subpoena
and the hearing or indeed following the proceedings.
<P>
<B>4. RECOMMENDATION:<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THAT THE TRIBUNAL BE CONSCIOUS OF THE THREAT THAT
NOTIFICATION OF AN OFFENDER HAS ON THE SECURITY OF VICTIM/ SURVIVORS.</FONT></B></B>
<P>
Current applicants and potential applicants are unable to be clearly
advised whether or not notification will occur. The risk that
their application will not be confidential is of particular concern
to Victims/survivors of sexual assault and family violence. The
risk of this occurring has already resulted in a number of applicants
indicating to their solicitors and counselors that they are not
proceeding with their claims and other potential applicants electing
not to pursue claims. Those who choose to pursue their claims
are reporting increased anxiety and distress at the knowledge
that the alleged offender has or may be notified.
<P>
Jane who was assaulted by her former husband, chose to proceed
with her application despite the Tribunal's advice that the offender
was to be notified. She said to her solicitor, &quot; since you
told me he was to be made aware of the hearing I haven't left
the house alone. My son is only allowed to play out the back and
I watch him constantly.&quot;
<P>
Mary was raped. On being told by her lawyer that the alleged offender
had been notified Mary instructed her solicitor to withdraw her
application as she was afraid.
<P>
<B>5. RECOMMENDATION: <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE PRACTICE OF NOTIFYING ALLLEGED OFFENDERS BE
CURTAILED IN LIGHT OF RECENT WTHDRAWALS OF APPLICATIONS BY APPLICANTS.</FONT></B></B>
<H3>OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO DECISION TO NOTIFY</H3>

<P>
In our view, at the very least, the Applicant should be given
an opportunity to address the Tribunal about its decision to notify
the alleged offender prior to the notification occurring. Currently
no such procedure is available although we know of one case where
the Applicant did get such an opportunity and the Tribunal elected
not to notify the alleged offender. 
<P>
F. applied for compensation for the injuries she suffered during
her marriage to D. She alleged that D. had physically assaulted
her, unlawfully imprisoned her and threatened to kill her. F.
had not reported the assaults to the police during the marriage
or since. F. had not seen a doctor at the time of the assaults
and so had no evidence of the physical injuries. F. feared that
D. would kill her if she reported the crimes to the police, a
doctor or anyone else. At the hearing the Tribunal member challenged
F. about the incidents, challenged F. about her injury and challenged
her about her fear of reporting the crime to the police. F. was
a good historian and described her ordeal in detail. The Tribunal
member asked F. what was the worst thing that had happened during
the marriage. F. described in detail the time D. made her sit
at the kitchen table as he loaded his gun. She described how she
froze in terror as D. placed the gun in her mouth and demonstrated
to her how easy it was for him to kill her. The Tribunal Member
without hesitation accepted the truth of F's account.
<P>
In this case he Tribunal were initially hesitant about granting
an Award to F. but after hearing evidence from her an Award was
made. Similarly, a Tribunal may consider it unnecessary and undesirable
to notify an alleged offender of an application after hearing
such evidence from the applicant. It would certainly be the safer
and more protective option to allow the applicant to explain at
the outset why the alleged offender should not be notified where
the tribunal proposes such action.
<P>
<B>6. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THAT WHERE AN ALLEGED OFFENDER IS TO BE NOTIFIED,
IN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE APPLICANT BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY
TO ADDRESS THE TRIBUNAL ABOUT ITS DECISION PRIOR TO SUCH NOTIFICATION.</FONT></B>
<H3>OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND HEARING - SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST</H3>

<P>
The letter sent to offenders pursuant to the Practice Direction
in our view quite improperly invites the offender to indicate
whether or not the offender wishes to appear at the hearing and
be represented. The assumption is made by the Tribunal that the
Alleged offender has a &quot;substantial interest&quot; in the
application. The Act provides that the alleged offender is only
entitled to appear at the hearing and be represented if he is
determined to have a &quot;substantial interest&quot; in the proceedings
(Section 11(1)). The Tribunal in our submission should not form
an opinion as to whether or not the alleged offender has a substantial
interest in the proceedings unless and until it hears submissions
from the alleged offender. This should be determined as a preliminary
issue prior to the hearing and the Applicant given an opportunity
to put forward submissions against the alleged offender's involvement
in the hearing process. The fact alone that he is the alleged
offender should not in itself be sufficient to determine that
he has a substantial interest. We state this in the context of
the difficulties detailed earlier in this paper i.e the possible
exposure to dangers and trauma victim/survivors are exposed to.
If it was intended that being an offender alone gave them a &quot;substantial
interest&quot; then all alleged offenders would always be entitled
to attend the hearing and section 11 would say that explicitly.
The decision reached on this preliminary issue should be reviewable.
Currently decisions in relation to interlocutory steps are not
reviewable. 
<P>
<B>7. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE TRIBUNAL SHOULD NOT FORM AN OPINION AS TO WHETHER AN ALLEGED OFFENDER HAS A SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST IN THE PROCEEDINGS UNTIL IT HEARS SUBMISSIONS FROM THE ALLEGED OFFENDER AS A PRELIMINARY ISSUE PRIOR TO HEARING AND THE APPLICANT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PUT FORWARD SUBMISSIONS AGAINST THE ALLEGED OFFENDERS INVOLVEMENT PRIOR TO HEARING.THE DECISION REACHED ON THIS PRELIMINARY ISSUE SHOULD BE REVIEWABLE. CURRENTLY DECISIONS IN RELATION TO INTERLOCUTORY STEPS ARE NOT REVIEWABLE.</FONT></B>
<P>
It is our view that an alleged offender could rarely be regarded
as having an &quot;interest&quot; or &quot;substantial interest&quot;
in the proceedings so as to entitle them to be notified pursuant
to section 7 and/or be entitled to appear at the hearing pursuant
to section 11(1). An alleged offender does not suffer any loss
of liberty or property as a result of the determination of the
Tribunal, no order is made against him/her and he/she is not a
party to the action (unless he has also been convicted of a criminal
act, in which case the conviction is conclusive evidence that
the crime occurred). Similarly his rights or the rights of his
child or children to apply for or exercise access with him are
not effected per se by the Tribunal's findings. Any evidence before
the Tribunal is not admissible in any other proceedings. The Family
Court which has an entirely different focus will, makes its own
decision about the welfare of the children based on the evidence
before it. 
<P>
The &quot;right&quot; of the alleged offender to defend his name
has also been suggested as justification for this practice. The
Tribunal have the power to prohibit the reporting of any application
or decision. In addition it is our experience that victims and
survivors of sexual assault and family violence do not use decisions
to publicly humiliate offenders. The alleged offender always could
have recourse to civil proceedings for defamation if his reputation
was unjustifiably affected.
<P>
Terri obtained compensation in the crimes compensation tribunal
for the abuse she had suffered as a child from her step-father.
Terri had been raped. He pleaded guilty in the Court to having
indecently assaulted her and was placed on a good behavior bond
so the real story was never told. Her mother and brothers forgave
him and couldn't understand why she could not. Apart from her
family no one else in the small country town even knew about the
criminal charges. . Relatives and family friends wondered why
she didn't come home for holidays anymore and she was branded
a snob. Terri was hurt and angry and she made a lengthy statement
to the Tribunal but she didn't tell the town or family friends
and relatives because she knew it would hurt her mother and brothers
more than him.
<P>
At a forum on crimes compensation held 19th September 1995, Supervising
Magistrate, Ms. Ann McDonald indicated that since the Practice
Direction was issued approximately 50 notifications had been made.
She further stated that in only a few cases had the alleged offenders
responded to such notifications and in only a couple of cases
had the alleged offender chosen to attend the hearing. These figures
demonstrate an overwhelming lack of &quot;interest&quot; on the
part of alleged offenders to participate in this forum. The Tribunal
have the power to prohibit the reporting of any application or
decision. The Practice of notification has in our view no justification
whatsoever but is having the effect of discouraging applicants
from proceeding, dissuading potential applicants from applying
and for those who proceed, adding further trauma to their experience.

<P>
<B>8. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THE TRIBUNAL HAVE THE POWER TO PROHIBIT THE REPORTING OF ANY APPLICATION OR DECISION. THE PRACTICE OF NOTIFICATION HAS NO JUSTIFICATION WHATSOEVER BUT IS HAVING THE EFFECT OF DISCOURAGING APPLICANTS FORM PROCEEDING, DISSUADING POTENTIAL APPLICANTS FROM APPLYING AND FOR THOSE WHO PROCEED, ADDING FURTHER TRAUMA TO THEIR EXPERIENCE.</FONT></B>
<H3>OPPORTUNITY OF ALLEGED OFFENDER TO PERUSE THE DOCUMENTS FILED BY THE APPLICANT</H3>

<P>
Paragraph 5 of the Practice Directions provide:
<P>
5. If an alleged offender elects to attend the hearing of the
application the Tribunal will:-
<P>
* notify the alleged offender of the date and place of the hearing;
and
<P>
* make available to the alleged offender a copy of the application
together with a copy of any statement made by the applicant setting
out the allegations made against the alleged offender.
<P>
An alleged offender or his/her legal representative will have
the right to peruse any police file in the possession of the Tribunal
as does the Applicant but will not be permitted to make photocopies
of any of the material contained in the police brief. The principles
of legal/medical privilege applicable in the civil law apply to
all material contained in the Tribunal's file.
<P>
This direction will enable Respondents to peruse those medical
reports filed by the Applicant and which she intends to rely upon
in her case. These reports often contain detailed information
about the Applicant's physical and psychological medical history.

<P>
It is our view that this Practice be immediately reviewed. In
our view an alleged offender should never be given any opportunity
to challenge a victim or the victim's medical witnesses on the
issue of &quot;injury suffered&quot;. The Tribunal can and should
decide this issue on the balance of probabilities on the evidence
before it. If there is insufficient evidence an Award can be refused.
In our view little assistance can be provided by the Respondent
in this regard but much harm will be done to victims/survivors
by allowing such access to reports and allowing victims/survivors
to be cross-examined on this issue. 
<P>
<B>9. RECOMMENDATION:</B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>IT IS OUR VIEW THAT THIS PRACTICE BE IMMEDIATELY
REVIEWED. IN OUR VIEW AN ALLEGED OFFENDER SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN
ANY OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE A VICTIM OR THE VICTIM'S MEDICAL
WITNESSES ON THE ISSUE OF &quot;INJURY SUFFERED&quot;. THE TRIBUNAL
CAN AND SHOULD DECIDE THIS ISSUE ON THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES
ON THE EVIDENCE BEFORE IT.</FONT></B>
<P>
The Tribunal needs to be wary as access to these reports could
be used by the alleged offender in any subsequent prosecution.
Further issues arise as to when the alleged offender should obtain
such access. If early access is available an alleged offender
may use the crimes compensation procedures to obtain this information
for their own interest and use. Once the material is obtained
the alleged offender may choose not to attend the hearing at all.
This practice is operating retrospectively. In filing medical
reports and other material, applicants to date have done so without
considering the consequences to them of the alleged offender having
access to them. Such applicants should be given an opportunity
to withdraw materials previously filed.
<P>
<B>9. RECOMMENDATION:</B>
<P>
<B>IN FILING MEDICAL REPORTS AND OTHER MATERIAL, APPLICANTS TO
DATE HAVE DONE SO WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCES TO THEM
OF THE ALLEGED OFFENDER HAVING ACCESS TO THEM. SUCH APPLICANTS
SHOULD BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO WITHDRAW MATERIALS PREVIOUSLY
FILED.</B>
<H3>CONDUCT OF THE HEARING</H3>

<P>
The involvement of alleged offenders in the hearing process is
extremely problematic.
<P>
Section 13(1) provides that where the Tribunal decides to conduct
a hearing of an application 
<P>
&quot;it shall hear and determine the application expeditiously
and subject to section 12(1)(b), informally, having regard to
the requirements of justice and without regard to legal forms
and solemnities and may act without observing legal rules relating
to evidence or procedure...&quot;
<P>
The alleged offender's has of course the right to refuse to give
evidence on the grounds of self-incrimination. If he chooses not
to give evidence, then in the interests of Natural Justice to
the Applicant, he should be further excluded from the hearing
and his refusal be seen as demonstrating a lack of interest. His
presence at the hearing would thereafter be of little assistance
to the Tribunal in determining whether or not a criminal act or
whether or not an injury occurred. 
<P>
Another of our concerns is the role played by the Tribunal itself
in the hearing process when an alleged offender attends whether
represented or otherwise. 
<P>
George was subpoenaed to attend a recent crimes compensation tribunal
hearing. He attended unrepresented and agreed to give evidence.
The Tribunal took George through his version of the events in
a manner not unlike examination in chief. The Tribunal did not
at any time take the opportunity to challenge George about his
version of the events. George did not deny the assault but attempted
to minimise the violence that had occurred. George's version was
inconsistent with the Applicant's version and the medical evidence.
George was cross-examined by the Applicant's legal representative.

<P>
Whilst this procedure may not be objectionable, it is in sharp
contrast to the role the Tribunal takes when the Applicant and
her witnesses give evidence. 
<P>
The applicant Jenny in a sexual assault case, had made it clear
she had not proceeded to prosecute the alleged offender as she
was afraid of him. The applicant Jenny stated that she did not
want the shame of everyone knowing. Nevertheless, the Magistrate
stated that if she was not prepared to prosecute then Jenny should
not be compensated. Later the Magistrate changed her mind and
made an award. 
<H3>DEFINITION OF VICTIM AND INJURY</H3>

<P>
There is an increasing trend in this jurisdiction to narrowly
interpret the definition of &quot;injury&quot;. This trend is
evidenced by the Tribunal's increasing reliance on psychiatrists
or clinical psychologists to determine the injury and their requirement
of a diagnosis of a recognisable pathology or disorder.
<P>
It is our view that the definition of &quot;injury&quot; should
be immediately reviewed so as to validate and acknowledge the
nature and extent of the suffering of victims of violence in the
home and sexual assault.
<P>
<B>10. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THAT THE DEFINITION OF &quot;INJURY&quot; SHOULD
BE IMMEDIATELY REVIEWED SO AS TO VALIDATE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE
NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE SUFFERING OF VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE IN THE
HOME AND SEXUAL ASSAULT.</FONT></B>
<H3>REGIONALISATION OF TRIBUNALS</H3>

<P>
Originally, the Tribunal was located in an office in the city
and it then began operating from the Prahran Magistrate's Court
as well. When its sole location was transferred to Prahran, per
force all sexual assault cases were heard there, consequently
allowing Tribunal members to build up expertise in this complex
and difficult area. This practice was extended when all sexual
assault cases were then transferred to the Central Registry at
the Melbourne Magistrates Court. However a recent practice Direction
issued on the 4th of May this year has ceased this practice. The
application for the primary victim must be now lodged and heard
at the Tribunal Court closest to where the primary victim resides.
We are concerned that with the regionalisation of the Tribunal,
the applications of victim/survivors of sexual assault will no
longer be dealt with by Magistrates who are aware of the sensitivity
needed and the complexity of the issues involved. 
<P>
The Chief Magistrate is concerned that &<a href ="#ref1">quot;constant exposure
to the pain and suffering of severely traumatised victims of crime
can lead to either cynicism, </a>&quot;compassion fatigue&quot; <a href ="#ref1">or
a heightened sensitivity to the plight of the severely psychologically
damaged applicants</a>&quot; and consequently is keen to insure that
there is a &quot;<a href ="#ref1">spread of this work to bring from time to time
a fresh approach to this difficult area of work.</a>&quot;<a href ="#ref1"><super>1</super></a> While
we would not wish to see members of the Tribunal &quot;burnt out&quot;
we are concerned that a &quot;fresh approach&quot; not be at the
risk of comprising equitable treatment and outcomes for victim/survivors
of sexual assault. A cynical view would be that there is a call
for more hardened Magistrates as a means of having costs reduced
rather than taking heed of a range of organisations including
The Australian Law Reform Commission for greater sensitivity and
gender awareness in sexual assault cases. <a href ="#ref1">Such Reports have clearly demonstrated that insensitivity of the judiciary and magistracy only serve to revictimise.<super>2</super></a> Consequently, we would advocate strongly
that in the event of all sexual assault matters not being heard
at a single location, that training be provided for all members
of the Tribunal so as to best equip them for dealing with such
a complex and sensitive area. 
<P>
<B>11. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THAT IN THE EVENT OF ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT MATTERS
NOT BEING HEARD AT A SINGLE LOCATION, THAT TRAINING BE PROVIDED
FOR ALL MEMBERS OF THE TRIBUNAL SO AS TO BEST EQUIP THEM FOR DEALING
WITH SUCH A COMPLEX AND SENSITIVE AREA. </FONT></B>
<H3>MAGISTRATES ATTITUDES</H3>

<P>
Feedback from practitioners and the victim/survivors they act
for, indicates that some magistrates continue to display attitudes
which are dismissive of the experiences of victim/survivors of
male violence. Some magistrates fail to understand the well documented
difficulties faced by victim survivors in seeking legal redress
for the crimes committed against them. In some cases it appears
that they adhere to outdated notions that women lie about having
been sexually assaulted. This is despite the large amount of work
which has gone into improving the gender awareness of the Magistracy.
<P>
Victim/survivors have endured hostility from Magistrates who have
doubted their integrity in reporting to police, crimes of sexual
assault committed against them in their teens. Some police have
a belief that women report sexual offenses in order to get crimes
compensation and are there for not genuine reasons. It would seem
that some Magistrates also hold to this view. One Magistrate even
took it upon himself to comment that a rape committed by a boy
on his sister was a demonstration of a natural curiosity and youthful
exhuberance, and reduced her award accordingly.
<P>
There have been several reports where Magistrates have, without
question, accepted gratuitous comments by police in their reports.
Centres Against Sexual Assault report that where victim/survivors
are reluctant to go ahead with criminal charges because of the
inherent trauma and re-victimisation this often brings about,
police in turn, are writing in their reports that they do not
believe the victim/survivors. Magistrates are in turn taking on
this belief as reality and questioning the bona fides of applications.
The impact of this attitude has and will continue to discourage
victim/survivors from applying for compensation. 
<P>
Some Magistrates are making conscious inferences that applicants
can be believed or not believed according to whether the alleged
offender attends the hearing. Hence in one case the alleged offender
didn't appear so the Magistrate decided on that basis that the
application was genuine. If Magistrates infer the genuineness
of applications based on assumptions about alleged offenders decisions
to not attend, they could feasibly infer that a crime had not
occurred on the basis that an alleged offender choosing to attend.
This type of discretion was not the intention of the legislation
which is supposed to be remedial and in favor of the applicant.
<P>
One outraged victim/survivor reports that she felt that the presiding
magistrate had made up her mind that no crime had taken place
before hearing and without hearing all relevant evidence,
<P>
A I was questioned ( not in the witness box) as a token gesture
and not with the thoroughness warranted by the situation..) ...
Whenever I spoke, (the magistrate) cut me short and I feel that
I did not have free speech or a genuine hearing. Later the magistrate
suggested the victim/survivor had played the A fragile flower
in order to manipulate the support of a particular detective.
<P>
Insensitive comments such as A you're smiling ,so you're obviously
no longer distressed reflect prejudices about what is an appropriate
demeanor for a real/deserving (sic) victim, and fail to demonstrate
any awareness that some people smile as a nervous reaction to
a situation they are in, such as being in a court room. 
<P>
Magistrates have placed considerable emphasis on the fact that
awards of compensation come from the public purse, implying that
they should be kept to a minimum, making applicants feel they
are being weighed in the scales of justice. The message this gives
to victim/survivors is that they are not deserving of compensation,
and flies in the face of the rationale for the Criminal Injuries
Act. This will often further traumatize the victim /survivor by
trivialising their experience on the grounds of the &quot;public
purse&quot;.
<P>
One woman was told by a magistrate that A you cant just front
up here with a statement and five supporting statutory declarations
of and expect to get crimes compensation. The five statutory declarations
of witnesses accompanied a letter from the woman's refuge she
stayed in, a letter from a police officer and a psychologists
report.
<P>
The co-ordinating Magistrate appears to have a suspicion of social
workers. She told one applicant that many social workers push
women into going for crimes compensation and that she felt that
women go from a controlling husband to a controlling social worker.
This is both an insult to the social work profession and the applicant
for Crimes Compensation.
<P>
<B>12. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THAT MAGISTRATES BE EDUCATED SO AS TO RAISE THEIR AWARENESS AND THEIR SENSITIVITY AS TO THE HARM AND DILEMMAS FACED BY VICTIM SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.</FONT></B>
<H3>USE OF POLICE STATEMENTS BY MAGISTRATES.</H3>

<P>
The police report will often form part of the tribunal's file.
Three areas are of concern. They are:
<P>
1. The contents of the police reports.
<P>
2. Their use by Magistrates.
<P>
3. Access to the file.
<P>
The police briefs often contain comments about the applicant and
the circumstances surrounding the crime which are not backed up
by evidence, trivialise the event, or are purely supposition or
expressions of personal opinion. They are thus highly prejudicial.
<P>
Comments have been made by police in sexual assault cases like:-
<P>
&quot;It may have a lot to do with the fact that she hangs around
with the wrong groups of people' and 'she must have been an easy
woman given where the incident happened&quot;
<P>
Such comments have little merit, particularly, as in this instance
the officer making the report had had no personal contact with
the applicant he was discussing.
<P>
Other reports make similarly unwarranted conclusions without any
investigation occurring and rely again on no direct contact between
the officer making the report and the victim other than:
<P>
&quot; after discussions with hospital staff I...&quot;
<P>
The Rape Law Reform Evaluation Project No.1 on page 101quotes
other police comments that are of concern. For example :
<P>
&quot;Just as a passing comment I would guess that 2/3rds of the
alleged rapes which I have attended have been false reports&quot;.

<P>
More care needs to be taken by police about the contents of their
reports. 
<P>
Many of the comments by police are often made in the context of
their frustration with the victim's decision not to press charges
or the ingrained suspicion of officers who are accustomed to dealing
with suspects rather than victims. It is stated in the publication
&quot;Sexual Assault: Law Reform May 1995&quot; by the Office
of The Status Of Women at page 47 that:
<P>
'Similarly, it is evident that some police continue to treat sexual
assault victims with disbelief, especially where consent is the
major issue, and some victims have been actively discouraged from
proceeding with reports&quot;
<P>
Such decisions by victims not to proceed are often due to the
police's disbelief that an assault occurred, a fear of reprisal
by the alleged offender, a lack of confidence in the court system,
a concern about being identified, or an uncertainty about what
sort of behavior is legally defined as rape.
<P>
Police do not consistently keep records of attendance's at domestic
violence calls. This means where no charges have been laid it
becomes difficult for women to prove that police had attended
as in the case of one of the women who wrote to us. A I had not
charged my ex husband or even made a statement, the police did
attend three times but my solicitor and the tribunal could find
no record of police attendance, although one of the police officers
could remember attending and sent a brief letter stating such.
<P>
The Rape Law Reform Evaluation Project No.1 at page 100 notes
that directives in the Detective Training School notes( current
in 1993) and still the basis of CIB training states that officers

<P>
&quot;must remember at all times that complaints in sexual assault
cases are easily made. False allegations resulting in sexual neuroses,
fantasy, jealousy, spite or simply a girl's refusal to admit...&quot;

<P>
The personal opinions in police reports are therefore not surprising
given their police training. In Victoria in1991 the Law Reform
Commission in association with the Victorian Community Council
Against Violence examined a sample of official police crime reports
to gather information about reasons given for not proceeding with
cases. The main reasons given in the crime reports were that there
was insufficient evidence or that the police felt the woman was
not being truthful or made a false report. This is referred to
in &quot;Sexual Assault: Law Reform May 1995&quot; by the Office
of The Status Of Women at page 47. 
<P>
Having established the concern over what is written in police
reports the next issue is the weight that some magistrates attach
to them. Some magistrates have stated that they will rely on police
reports in the absence of an applicant. Some Magistrates will
defer to and give weight to these often unsubstantiated reports
rather than the victim's version because of the 'expertise' of
police - police who are not psychologists or counseling experts
but who will conclude that because of a victim's 'calm demeanor'
that she is 'unaffected'. A calm demeanor can relate to shock
or exhaustion of the applicant and a further examination by qualified
experts would have revealed this. This reliance on police reports
by magistrates places a heavy burden on the applicant's solicitor
and may serve to compound further the trauma of the applicant
which was the initial reason for the application.
<P>
There are still reports of the applicants or their solicitors
being refused access to the police file despite the new practice
directions and the protocols in place that notify police that
the material may be released. We have heard of instances in the
Heidelberg, Ballarat and Geelong Tribunals where applicant's solicitors
have been denied access. Clearly the Practice Directions are not
being applied uniformly. Given the prejudicial nature of the reports
it is vital for the applicant's case that they know, in advance,
what the often spurious conclusions by police are so they can
rebut them so as to avoid the risk of such reports coloring the
magistrate's determination.
<P>
In one instance, an alleged offender had all the tribunal's documents
including personal medical records in support of her claim and
the police reports under FOI. The applicant however, did not have
the same access to her own file. Does this enable the alleged
offender the opportunity to cross-examine the applicant? (it is
a reality that often an alleged offender will be represented whereas
an applicant will not be represented) Does the applicant have
a similar right to cross examine the alleged offender? Isn't this
moving away towards an adversarial setting which tribunals were
supposed to avoid? What the implications of access of the alleged
offender to these medical records will be for the applicants in
later court actions can only be feared, particularly, as a mental
disorder must be proven for an applicant to establish a non- physical
claim. In an adversarial court setting the 'disorder'( needed
to be proven to establish a claim before a tribunal) may discredit
the applicant's story when he/she is cross examined by an aggressive
defense barrister as 'unstable'.
<P>
In summary, the police need to be more responsible and cautious
in the contents of their reports and the Magistracy need to actively
disregard unsubstantiated, unsworn the police commentary. 
<P>
<B>13. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THAT THE POLICE NEED TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE AND
CAUTIOUS IN THE CONTENTS OF THEIR REPORTS AND THE MAGISTRACY NEED
TO ACTIVELY DISREGARD UNSUBSTANTIATED, UNSWORN THE POLICE COMMENTARY.
</FONT></B>
<H3>THE PUBLIC PURSE</H3>

<P>
Unlike other forms of community compensation, Crimes Compensation
is not funded by any insurance levies such as those which apply
for worker's compensation or transport accident compensation.
Crimes compensation is paid directly from the consolidated fund.
There are many anecdotal stories regarding the attitudes of Magistrates
when hearing Crimes Compensation Applications as they see themselves
as protectors of the public purse. It is an attitude which first
enables the Magistrate to first justify the low level of their
award, and secondly to make the victim feel undeserving, almost
to the point of their being an opportunity in applying to the
Crimes Compensation Tribunal. It is an attitude that is not uncommon
in other areas of compensation, but without the contribution of
insurance levies there is less room for the attitude of just deserts.
<P>
In representing the public purse, Tribunals take on an adversarial
position against the Applicant. If Tribunals intend to conduct
hearings using this adversarial method the Tribunal should always
be assisted by counsel so that they can listen to the evidence
without distraction and without any confusion as to their role.
<P>
The current shift to crimes compensation needs to be seen in light
of an obvious, although camouflaged aim of reducing the cost of
the Crimes Compensation Tribunal by making it more restrictive
and aiming to discourage categories of victims from applying for
compensation. Unfortunately the victims are , in our submission,
most deserving of compensation, namely women and children who
are the victims of violence and sexual assault. It is not the
police officers who not only make up the largest claimants who
are in paid employment but also have the added compensation avenue
of worker's compensation, who will be deterred from making claims
under the new directions.
<P>
In official statistics men are reflected in claims for crimes
compensation however, women and children who are often intimidated
or ashamed to report violence or sexual assault remain as the
hidden statistics. If the Crimes Compensation Tribunal continues
to conduct itself in the manner outlined in this position paper
then it will mean that it will become even more difficult for
the vulnerable express their plight and receive some form of acknowledgment
from the State of the harm they have suffered. 
<P>
<B>14. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B>THAT THE VICTORIAN GOVERNMENT INCLUDE A CRIMES COMPENSATION
FUND IN THE GUIDELINES FOR THE ALLOCATION OF THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT
FUND.</B>
<H3>WHERE SHOULD THE MONEY COME FROM?</H3>

<P>
It is the view of the VAWAC that there is a significant pool of
money in the community support fund raised from gambling revenue
at the Casino. This fund is said to receive $1m per week. (Sunday
Age 25th June 1995 p23)
<P>
After funds have been allocated to Arts, Tourism, Community Services,
Sport, Recreation and research on Gambling, there should still
be enough for other purposes which are of benefit to the community.
This could feasibly include a fund for Crimes Compensation.
<P>
Further reasons why the gambling money could fund Crimes Compensation
are that some crime will be committed as a result of gambling
addiction, there will always be an enormous pool of money in this
fund, it is not directly derived from individual offenders in
the courts most of whom would not have means to pay, and the community
has a moral obligation to compensate victims of crime
<P>
<B>15. RECOMMENDATION: </B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>THAT MONEY TO PAY COMPENSATION BE DEDUCTED FROM
THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT FUND RATHER THAN ALLOW CUTBACKS IN AWARDS
WHICH SERVE TO RECOGNISE AND REHABILITATE VICTIM/SURVIVORS OF
SEXUAL ASSAULT.</FONT></B>
<H3>SUMMARY</H3>

<P>
The current procedures , attitudes of magistrates, use of police
reports, and cost cutting arguments are undermining the very supportive
role the Tribunal should be exercising in its deliberations involving
victim/survivors of crime. The issues and problems highlighted
in this paper need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.
<H3>OTHER ISSUES OF CONCERN</H3>

<P>
Since the preparation of this paper other areas of concern have
come to our attention. In an effort to have this paper published
as soon as possible we will list other areas of concern which
are also in need of community focus and discussion. They are:
<P>
1. The reported refusal of some Tribunal members to pay for CASA
reports.
<P>
2. The refusal of Tribunal members to accept reports of experienced
and qualified people and therefore the further pathologising of
the Tribunals evidentiary basis.
