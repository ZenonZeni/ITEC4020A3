<p align="center"><font size="4"><b>DEAth In Colorado</b></font><b> <br>
Hemp Cultivation Killed By House Agriculture Committee</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 11,1996, Denver CO:</b>&nbsp;
Legislation (SB 67) that would have allowed Colorado to become
the first state to legally grow industrial hemp since World War
II was killed by the House Agriculture Committee by a stunning
8-5 vote.&nbsp; The vote came as a surprise to many who had watched
support for domestic hemp legislation grow in recent weeks,
including gaining approval from the full Senate. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Many witnesses attribute the outcome to a collective show of
force from law and drug enforcement officials.&nbsp; During the
four hour hearing, twelve law enforcement officials testified against
the bill, including regional DEA representative Greg Williams and
Colorado Bureau of Investigation Director Carl Whiteside.&nbsp;
Among their arguments, law enforcement testified that there is no
difference between industrial hemp and marijuana and that passing
the Hemp Industrial Production Act would send the wrong message
to young people.&nbsp; &quot;In the minds of many, ... [support
for] this will be perceived as a weakening of our anti-marijuana
message in our society,&quot; stated Special Agent Williams. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Fear and intimidation&quot; scared off support for this
bill in the Committee, said the bill's sponsor, Senator Lloyd
Casey (D-Northglenn).&nbsp; Hemp activist Laura Kriho of the
Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP) agrees.&nbsp; The
emotional pressure and scare tactics used by these law enforcement
agencies effectively strong-armed the state legislature, forcing
them to vote for the police and against the farmers of
Colorado.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">One legislator who voted against the measure, Rep. Russell George
(R-Rifle), explained in an interview immediately after the
hearing how the testimony of law enforcement influenced his decision.&nbsp;
&quot;The key factor in making up my vote was when the ... DEA
... testified and said that under no circumstances would [they]
issue any kind of registration or permit,&quot; he said.&nbsp;
&quot;That meant anything else we did with this bill was a waste
of time and was moot because the bill itself said that ...
farmer[s] couldn't go forward without a DEA registration.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The presence of the DEA at the hearing was especially troubling
to both Casey and hemp proponents who noted that, prior to the
April 11 hearing, representatives from the agency had been
cooperative with the bill's backers.&nbsp; In the past, the DEA
in Colorado had &quot;appeared helpful,&quot; noted Kriho.&nbsp;
&quot;We had even been told that ... the DEA in Washington, D.C.
[was] in the process of reviewing policies related to industrial
hemp production.&nbsp; ... [However,] after the DEA testimony at
the hearing, I believe it is safe to say that the DEA is not
working with hemp proponents.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite this setback, activists remain positive that domestic
hemp cultivation in Colorado remains a tangible goal.&nbsp;
&quot;We [still] have a lot of momentum and a lot of
support,&quot; Kriho stated.&nbsp; &quot;We are now in the
process of evaluating our strategies and determining our courses
of action.&nbsp; We have several interesting options and are
excited to be able to pursue them.&quot;&nbsp; Unfortunately,
though, any future efforts to legalize industrial hemp in
Colorado will be without the efforts of either Lloyd Casey or
Reps. Steve Acquafresca (R-Cedaredge) and Bill Jerke (R-
Lasalle), all of whom are stepping down after this year's
session.&nbsp; When asked by <b>NORML</b> if Casey foresees any legislators
in Colorado willing to carry the torch after he leaves, the
Senator's only response was: &quot;I hope so.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Initiative Enters Final
Week <br>
Activists Expect To Have Necessary Number Of Signatures</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b>&nbsp; An
initiative to legalize the medical use of marijuana appears to
have the necessary number of signatures to place it on the
November 1996 California ballot, reports Californians for
Compassionate Use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;When organizers across the state turned in their respective
estimates ... of signatures gathered for the Compassionate Use
Initiative of 1996, the [total] came to over 500,000,&quot;
reported the CCU on April 12, one week before the deadline.&nbsp;
The number needed to qualify the initiative for the 1996 ballot
is 433,269. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Activists note that an additional 120,000 to 140,000 signatures
were anticipated to have been gathered during the drive's final
week.&nbsp; Such a figure would be well over the amount needed to compensate
for any errors or invalid signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the medical use of marijuana.&nbsp; If the initiative is passed
by California voters this fall, the bill will become law
immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The 1996 initiative has been endorsed by the cities of San
Francisco, Oakland, and West Hollywood; the Santa Cruz and Marin
Boards of Supervisors; the California Nurses Association; the Los
Angeles AIDS Commission; the California Multiple Sclerosis
Society; the Orange County Register, and many other health and
community leaders and organizations. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Supreme Court Hears Arguments On Civil
Forfeiture</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp;
Oral arguments were heard before the Supreme Court in a case that
may determine whether seizing property from criminally prosecuted
drug dealers constitutes double jeopardy under the United States
Constitution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;Civil forfeiture has never been deemed so punitive ... as
to constitute a prosecution or punishment under the
[Constitution's] double jeopardy clause,&quot; contended Justice
Department lawyer Michael Dreeben on behalf of the Clinton
administration.&nbsp; The attorney urged the Court to overturn
two double-jeopardy decisions in which federal appeals courts in
Michigan and California found civil forfeiture following a
criminal prosecution to be unconstitutional. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;[This] is, in my mind, the single most important case
involving the government's forfeiture authority in the area of
narcotics, and possibly other areas,&quot; said Attorney Lawrence
Robbins of Washington, D.C., one of two attorneys arguing against
the government's controversial, double-barreled anti-drug
strategy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;If this looks like a punishment ... what then is the reason
for not treating it like punishment,&quot; asked Justice William
H. Rehnquist during the procedures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, no
one may be &quot;subject for the same offense to be twice put in
jeopardy of life or limb.&quot;&nbsp; The Supreme Court has
interpreted this provision to prohibit multiple punishments for
the same crime. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The Court is expected to rule on this issue sometime in June. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Cincinnati Buyers Club Founder To Face Grand
Jury</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Cannabis Buyers
Club -- one of an estimated 30 underground clubs located across
the country that supplies marijuana as a therapeutic agent to
seriously ill patients who possess a physician's recommendation --
has been subpoenaed to testify before the Grand Jury of Kenton,
Kentucky on April 19 in connection with a February raid by law
enforcement officers on the club's headquarters.&nbsp; Although Evans
admits to having had two marijuana seedlings growing at the
headquarters at the time of the bust, officials failed to seize
the plants or issue a warrant for his arrest. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans anticipates that the state's latest action is an attempt to
interrogate him about details of the club's activity, such as
membership and suppliers.&nbsp; Evans informs <b>NORML</b> that
he has been advised and intends &quot;to take the Fifth&quot; at
tomorrow's hearing.&nbsp; Evans further insists that he will begin
a hunger strike if the State decides to incarcerate him following
tomorrow's proceedings. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am sick of living in a country where I can't be
free,&quot; Evans adamantly summarized at a press conference last
February.&nbsp; &quot;Give me liberty or give me death.&nbsp; We
are going to have a cannabis buyer's club. <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Assembly Committee Votes For
Tougher Pot Penalties</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 16, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp; The
California Assembly Public Safety Committee slammed the door on
drug reformers by soundly defeating a bill to lessen penalties
for medical marijuana and approving another measure to increase
marijuana prison sentences. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The committee, whose complexion has shifted sharply to the right
with the Republican takeover of the Assembly this year, turned a
deaf ear to the pleas of medical marijuana patients, physicians and
AIDS support groups by rejecting a medical marijuana bill
sponsored by Rep. John Burton (D-San Francisco).&nbsp; The Burton
bill (AB 2120) was a heavily watered-down version of legislation introduced
last year by Assemblyman John Vasconcellos to allow for the
prescribed use of marijuana for the sick and terminally ill. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Despite the bill's concessions, Burton's proposed legislation was
defeated handily by a vote of 7-1, signifying a major reversal in
the committee's attitude regarding medical marijuana.&nbsp; In
the past, the committee had been receptive toward the medical
marijuana issue and had approved legislation allowing for it's
use three years in a row.&nbsp; This year, Burton's measure was
actively opposed by the California Narcotics Officers
Association, the Governor's Department of Health, and Attorney
General Lungren, who argued that the legislation undercut the
established system of drug regulation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Meanwhile, the committee eagerly approved a measure introduced by
Assemblyman Charles Poochigan (R-Fresno) to enhance prison
sentences by three years and up for marijuana convictions
involving a kilogram or more. Two Democrats joined Republicans in
approving the bill, which was strongly backed by the Narcotics
Officers and District Attorney's associations.&nbsp; &quot;The committee
appeared indifferent to the costs of imprisoning more offenders
for non-violent crime,&quot; stated California NORML State
Coordinator Dale Gieringer, who had opposed the measure.&nbsp; &quot;Throughout
the day, it routinely approved all other penalty enhancement
bills with no regard as to whether the offenses were violent,
serious, or victimless. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Drug-law reformers hope to derail AB 2764 in the
Democratic-controlled State Senate, Gieringer noted. <br>

<p align="center"><b>Assemblyman Vasconcellos Introduces Medical
Marijuana Bill<br>
For Second Year In A Row</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April, 1996, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
California Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, who last year introduced
a medical marijuana bill that made it all the way to the
Governor's desk before being vetoed, has once again introduced a
measure that would spell some relief for users of medical marijuana.&nbsp;
This year's measure would allow a person suffering from AIDS,
cancer, multiple sclerosis, or glaucoma to offer their medical
condition as a defense in a California courtroom if charged with
cultivation or possession of marijuana.&nbsp; The bill will be
considered by the California Assembly Public Safety Committee on
April 23.</p>
