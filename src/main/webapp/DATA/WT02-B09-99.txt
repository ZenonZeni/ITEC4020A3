<font SIZE=+1>An Inside Look at Air Pollution Complicated public policy
issues are at stake </font>
<p>by Ken Sexton </p>

<p>On particularly smoggy days, small children and people with respiratory
illness are encouraged to stay indoors to avoid health risks from air pollution.
While this may be good advice if the goal is to reduce exposures to, let's
say, ozone, there is substantial evidence that concentrations of many airborne
pollutants are often higher inside buildings and vehicles than outside.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that being indoors, as, for example,
in a residence, office, or automobile, can offer protection from exposure
to some airborne agents, while at the same time increasing exposure to
others. </p>

<p>Concerns about the healthfulness of indoor air are driven by six major
factors. First, it is now widely recognized that most people spend more
than 90 percent of their time indoors. Groups potentially more susceptible
to the effects of air pollution, like infants, the infirm, and the elderly,
are inside virtually all the time. Because most of us spend so much time
inside, indoor pollution concentrations, even if they are uniformly lower
than outdoor levels, make a significant contribution to our average exposure
over a day, week, season, or year. </p>

<p>Second, modern indoor environments contain a complex array of potential
sources of air pollution, including synthetic building materials, consumer
products, and dust mites. Airborne emissions also occur because of the
people, pets, and plants that inhabit these spaces. Efforts to lower energy
costs by reducing ventilation rates have increased the likelihood that
pollutants generated indoors will accumulate. </p>

<p>Third, monitoring studies inside buildings and vehicles have consistently
found that concentrations of many air pollutants tend to be higher indoors
than out. Indoor air has been shown to be a complex mixture of chemical,
biological, and physical agents, only a small fraction of which has been
characterized adequately. This complexity is illustrated by the fact that
more than 4,000 different compounds have been identified in tobacco smoke
alone. </p>

<p>Fourth, scientific reports indicate that indoor measurements are often
better than outdoor measurements for classifying, estimating, and predicting
human exposures to many air pollutants. This is true even for some agents
that are primarily of outdoor origin. A promising approach to more realistic
exposure estimation is the development and refinement of models that combine
information about pollutant concentrations in both indoor and outdoor settings
with data on time-activity patterns. </p>

<p>Fifth among the factors driving indoor air concerns, complaints about
inadequate indoor air quality and associated discomfort and illness are
a burgeoning problem in our society. Reports of illness outbreaks among
building occupants, particularly office workers, with no secondary spread
of the illness to others outside the building with whom affected individuals
come into contact, have become commonplace. EPA classifies these reports
into two general categories. Building- related illness refers to episodes
when symptoms of diagnosable illness are identified and can be attributed
directly to airborne contaminants in the building. In contrast, sick-building
syndrome is defined as situations in which building occupants experience
acute health and comfort effects that appear to be linked to time spent
in the building, but no specific illness or cause can be identified. </p>

<p>The so-called chemical sensitivity syndromes, which may be caused only
partially or not at all by chemicals, are a different, although potentially
related matter. Broadly defined, &quot;multiple chemical sensitivity&quot;
(MCS) is postulated to be development of responsiveness, including manifestation
of often disabling symptoms, to extremely low concentrations of chemicals
following sensitization. A controversial and emotional topic, the concept
of MCS as a distinct entity caused by exposure to chemicals has been challenged
by the medical and scientific communities, and there appears to be consensus
that substantially more study is needed before MCS should be considered
as a clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, many sufferers of MCS continue to
believe that their conditions are either caused or exacerbated by indoor
air pollution. </p>

<p>And sixth, exposures to many indoor air pollutants are known or suspected
to occur at levels sufficient to cause illness or injury. Scientific evidence
suggests that respiratory disease, allergy, mucous membrane irritation,
nervous system effects, cardiovascular effects, reproductive effects, and
lung cancer may be linked to exposures to indoor air pollutants. </p>

<p>Scientists consistently rank indoor air pollution at or near the top
of environmental health risks in the United States. EPA reports on risk-based
priority setting, like Unfinished Business (1987), Reducing Risk (1990),
and the Regional Comparative Risk Projects (1989-92), all ranked indoor
air pollution as a high- priority risk to human health. Public opinion
polls, however, continue to find that most Americans do not perceive the
risks of indoor air pollution to be great. </p>

<p>The specter of potential public health risks from contaminated indoor
air presents decision makers with a dilemma. Is the problem serious enough
to warrant intervention, and, if so, what preventive or remedial actions
are most appropriate? </p>

<p>The significance of indoor air exposures for acute and chronic health
effects remains uncertain in most cases. Nevertheless, there is ample reason
for concern and caution. For example, it has been estimated that exposures
of nonsmokers to ETS (Environmental Tobacco Smoke) may cause as many as
3,000 lung cancer deaths annually in the United States, as well as contribute
to a wide range of noncancer diseases, including pneumonia, bronchitis,
and asthma. Findings from several studies suggest that indoor concentrations
of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and respirable particles can exceed
the National Ambient (Outdoor) Air Quality Standards set by EPA to protect
public health. And results from many studies show that a plethora of volatile
organic chemicals and pesticides known to be toxic and/or carcinogenic
can occur indoors at concentrations significantly higher than levels that
create concerns in outdoor air. </p>

<p>Designing effective and efficient indoor control strategies requires
an understanding of several pertinent factors. Contaminant characteristics
need to be considered, including factors like concentration, reactivity,
and physical state. Emission source configurations (e.g., area or point
sources) must be taken into account, and it is necessary to determine whether
discharges are continuous or intermittent. It is also important to understand
the dose-response relationship for the contaminant of interest so that
informed decisions can be made whether individuals are to be protected
from short-term exposures to peak concentrations or from long-term exposures
to relatively low concentrations. And, of course, the type of indoor enclosure
(e.g., residence, office, car) has ramifications for which approaches and
methods are viable options. </p>

<p>But providing and maintaining healthful indoor air quality is more than
just a complex scientific and technical issue. Realization that contaminated
indoor air may pose an unacceptable health hazard raises complicated policy
questions about the proper role of government in safeguarding people's
health inside public and private spaces. </p>

<p>Because concerns about adverse health consequences from air pollution
have focused traditionally on outdoor and occupational exposures, federal
and state government programs concentrate on protecting public health from
outdoor air pollutants or protecting workers' health from dangerous air
pollutants in the industrial workplace. As mentioned earlier, EPA sets
and enforces National Ambient Air Quality Standards that are designed to
protect the general public to within an adequate margin of safety. The
Occupational Safety and Health Administration enforces consensus standards
for industrial work environments, which are designed such that no employee
will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity. However,
federal responsibility and authority for indoor air quality in the nonworkplace
are less well defined. </p>

<p>There is ample precedent for government authority and responsibility
to protect public health and welfare inside buildings. It is common practice,
for instance, to regulate construction and operation of public buildings
to ensure that adequate provisions are made for health and safety. Government
inspectors routinely enforce building codes, health regulations, safety
rules, and fire ordinances. While government has an obligation to protect
public health in indoor as well as outdoor environments, the justification
for direct government intervention varies according to the characteristics
associated with different types of indoor settings. </p>

<p>Creation of a regulatory framework for protecting indoor environmental
quality poses special policy issues. Promulgation of indoor air quality
standards and other regulations must acknowledge that individuals, especially
in private residences, are already making decisions about their own air
quality. Development of effective and reasonable policy requires an appreciation
of the scope for private action, as well as consideration of the likelihood
that public intervention will foster improved private choices. </p>

<p>This is not to suggest that rules and regulations have no part to play
in safeguarding indoor air quality. This form of intervention is, however,
not necessarily optimal or even desirable in certain types of indoor environments.
There are, of course, many different types of indoor environments--for
example, occupational settings, both industrial and nonindustrial; nonoccupational
settings, including residential, commercial, institutional, and public;
and transportation microenvironments, such as automobiles, airplanes, subways,
and trains. </p>

<p>The role of government varies according to the &quot;publicness&quot;
of a particular space as well as the nature of air-pollution health risks,
either voluntary or nonvoluntary. Understanding the diversity of nonindustrial
indoor environments is an important step in the design and implementation
of practical and cost-effective control strategies. </p>

<p>The rationale for government regulation of outdoor air pollution is
based in part on a definition of outdoor air as a &quot;public good&quot;
and on the realization that those who suffer the effects of such pollution
are neither compensated by, nor powerful in influencing, polluters. The
situation is quite different for some indoor environments, especially private
residences, for both the costs and benefits of pollution control are internalized
with households. </p>

<p>If occupants foul the air in their home, they are forced to breathe
it. If they attempt to improve its quality by increasing ventilation or
installing air-cleaning devices, they bear the costs and enjoy the benefits.
For some contaminants, such as tobacco smoke, odorants, and water vapor,
benefits are readily recognizable through improvements in perceptible air
quality and reduction of corrosion, soiling, and molds. </p>

<p>The closed-loop, cost-benefit cycle within residences suggests that
individual decisions are important determinants of indoor air quality.
However, unlike residential energy consumption, where monthly bills from
the local utility company provide periodic feedback to consumers, indoor
contaminants may be below irritation or odor thresholds. Thus, although
individuals are certainly making decisions about their own air quality,
it is not clear that these are &quot;informed&quot; decisions. Government
actions aimed at improving personal decisions about indoor air quality
may be preferable to rules and regulations (e.g., simple warning devices,
product labeling, or information programs). </p>

<p>It has been suggested that the Clean Air Act be amended to give EPA
authority to control indoor air pollution in much the same way that outdoor
air pollution is currently controlled. However, setting and enforcing strict
indoor air quality standards, similar to existing National Ambient Air
Quality Standards, would be impractical because of the prohibitive monitoring
costs and the difficulty of enforcement within approximately 82 million
residences in the United States. </p>

<p>Perhaps the most serious impediment to implementing a regulatory approach
is public antipathy towards this form of intervention inside the home.
Restriction of indoor pollution sources, certification of &quot;safe&quot;
indoor concentrations, product emission standards, disclosure of potential
sources upon transfer of ownership, and specification of minimum ventilation
requirements are examples of government actions that are likely to be less
costly and more effective than indoor air quality standards. </p>

<p>Not all buildings are residences, and not all residences are owner-occupied.
The rationale for direct government intervention aimed at improving indoor
air quality is much stronger in public, as opposed to private buildings.
Air quality in large public buildings, for instance, displays many characteristics
of a public good. A person sensitive to tobacco smoke would not rationally
pay the costs of cleaning the air in a large convention hall. The costs
would greatly exceed any personal benefits an individual might derive from
smoke-free air, and those who did not contribute could not be excluded
from enjoying the benefits. In this situation, the rationale for regulation
is similar to that for outdoor air pollution. </p>

<p>There is also substantial justification for regulatory intervention
in private and public buildings where occupants do not have control over
their own environment--for example, modern high-rise office buildings.
Typically, building managers are responsible for operation and maintenance
of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. Occupants
of the building, including both employers and employees, often have little
or no direct control of temperature, fresh air input, and ventilation rate.
Because HVAC systems are normally operated to minimize energy costs, the
health and comfort of tenants rarely become an issue unless a significant
number of complaints are reported. </p>

<p>Because health risks in this situation tend to be nonvoluntary, government
may have a responsibility to safeguard public health by defining what constitutes
acceptable indoor air and taking steps to ensure that those criteria are
met. Examples of government actions that might be warranted include specification
of minimum ventilation rates necessary to achieve healthful indoor air
quality, establishment of emission limitations for building materials,
and development of indoor air quality guidelines or standards for important
contaminants. </p>

<p>As a practical matter, however, development of a comprehensive federal
approach to address problems of indoor air pollution awaits resolution
of important public policy and public health questions about the proper
role of government in safeguarding the air quality inside public and private
spaces. </p>
