<H4>Vehicle performance</H4>There are many myths connected to electric vehicles. One is that electric cars are inherently low performing in actual traffic. This view is however related to the earlier commercially available technologies, that to a large degree came from the area of vehicles and devices of material handling
within industry. As a contrast, the dedicated electric car technologies developed in the 1990s are very different from the earlier developments with respect of overall performance, battery life, power-to-weight ratios, and peak range capability.




<P>Good electric cars (i.e. semi-conversions or purpose-built) have the potential to fulfil the needs of many fleet operators even with the commercially available battery technologies of today (lead-acid and Nickel-Cadmium), and with the technologies on the verge of commercialisation (e.g. Nickel-Metal Hydride and Lithium-ion), these cars will be attractive even for private car ownership. With battery
technologies presently in the "laboratories'" (e.g. Lithium-Solid-Polymer), range will no longer be a problem. Cost issues still have to be resolved, though, but as in many cases of technological change, we can never in advance know how far costs can be cut by actors on a real market. 
</P>







<P>A hybrid vehicle can be tailored to imitate or exceed the range, torque etc. of a conventional car. An EV should rather be viewed in its own light. </P>

<H5>The battery is the most decisive factor for EV performance.

<H4>Operational functionality</H4>In the Swedish city projects, EVs have operated since 1993, reaching as much as 37 000 km in two and a half years of circulation for some vehicles.





<P>For heavy vehicles and cargo transport, hybrid systems offer the highest potential due to the energy needed for a full working day. Regarding bus operation, passenger opinions and factors like the &#148;environmental appeal&#148; of new vehicle technology are important to fleet operators apart from hard facts on emissions and life cycle improvements.
</P>




In the present project running at KFB regarding electric and hybrid buses, several bus types are evaluated from different angels. As bus buyers are fewer, buy vehicles by the dozen rather than single and see vehicle cost as a smaller portion of total expenses, there is an openness towards environmentally sound propulsion technology, manifested for example in the ethanol and natural gas buses becoming increasingly popular by public transport authorities.

<H4>Traffic performance and safety
</H4>

<P>EVs and hybrids must be granted performance to comply with city traffic tempo. This is achieved for the various demonstration vehicles, receiving positive remarks on acceleration and handling from vehicle drivers. Dealing with the negative aspects of EV soundlessness, no accidents or even close encounters have been reported. Part of the explanation may be that everywhere EVs operate, virtually soundless bicycles may also appear, forcing pedestrians to turn their heads regardless of traffic noise.</P>





<P>When this is written, only regular steel-bodied EVs with proven crash safety features run in KFB supported projects. However, there is a clear indication that EVs and hybrids may profit from lighter bodies, mostly due to the potential in extending range through weight reduction. Light vehicle structures is traditionally viewed as less safe by customers and national vehicle certification agencies, and the challenge to produce and market  safe, light vehicles remains. In all cases all vehicles running on swedish roads must conform to applicable safety certifications.
