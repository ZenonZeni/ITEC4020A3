How To Make An Aluminum Wheel</H1>
</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Start with the styling. Then, in the case of Alloy Wheels International Ltd.'s operation in Cardiff, which has an annual production capacity of about 700,000 wheels per year, it is onto a CAD system for the design; they're using CADDS 5 from Computervision. Next, the solid model created in that system undergoes stress analysis with Mechanica software from Parametric Technology and then casting analysis with ProCAST software. The objective, of course, is to make sure that the tooling is designed so that the wheel as designed can be produced. Alloy Wheels sources its tooling for the casting process from a sister company, P.M.P., which is located nearby. The tooling firm makes use of the CAD file generated by the Alloy Wheels engineers.

<P>After requisite testing, it is a matter of casting, X-raying the castings (an issue with aluminum wheel production is the possibility of porosity, which is unacceptable), then machining. It is necessary to turn the rim, drill and finish the bolt holes and the center bore, and drill the valve stem hole. Then there is a surface coating process (aluminum does oxidize, so protection is required).

<P>Looking for a competitive edge in an extremely competitive market, Alloy Wheels is bringing up a new process for wheel production, Alulite, which is said to produce wheels that are 10 to 15% lighter than those made with conventional processes. Essentially, the wheel is cast pretty much in the ordinary manner. The front surface of the wheel looks normal. But looked at from the side, the casting is squatter. The cast wheel is heated to a temperature on the order of 350 to 400&#186;C, then moved into a Leico flow forming machine. There are three rollers within the machine that roll out the rim to the requisite size. The machine has a one-minute cycle time. The first customers for Alulite wheels are Jaguar and Rover. It is expected that Fiat and GM will follow, in the `98 model year.

<P>Alloy Wheels is developing a production process that is beyond Alulite. It's called &quot;press-split-roll.&quot; Instead of casting, the process begins with a flat aluminum blank from which a circular shape is stamped. The features of the wheel are formed on the face of the blank. That's the &quot;press&quot; portion. In order to produce the rim, the blank is split from the edges to the point where the outer diameter of the face begins. The top half of the split material is removed. How the splitting is performed is apparently the trick of the process, as the people at Alloy Wheels wouldn't divulge the method. The wheel-in-becoming is placed in a spinning machine where the rim is formed. It's said that the mechanical properties created 
are superior with this process. Work on productionizing the 
process is still underway.</I>

Too Much

<P>Want to talk about an over-capacity situation that is driving those that want to survive to be lean, mean, innovative and/or deep-pocketed? Check out the alloy wheel suppliers in Europe.

<P>There are 15 suppliers with a total capacity of 24 million wheels. More than half of the companies in that group make a million wheels per year or fewer. The largest, Hayes, produces 2.5 million. In the U.S., Hayes produces 7.1 million. These numbers are according to Alloy Wheels International (which has a European capacity of 2.1 million wheels).

<P>About that 24-million wheel capacity: the number of aluminum wheels required by European carmakers is 18 
million. Which means that there is 25% over-capacity.

<P>The real action for aluminum wheels is in the U.S. market, where there is a total capacity of 38 million wheels and a sales total of 33 million. Because Alloy Wheels wanted to be a player in North America, it has recently purchased from Volkswagen a wheel manufacturing facility in Barrie, Ontario, Canada.<P>

<B>One of the biggest difficulties for carmakers that he sees in Europe, one which he maintains accounts for the comparative higher prices for cars there as compared within the U.S., is, in a word, &quot;fragmentation.&quot; There are, he points out, 34 companies trying to get a piece of the market in the United Kingdom (he anticipates 1996 vehicle sales in the U.K. of over 2 million). Of the 34, there are 20 that have less then 1% of the total.

<P>&quot;Being lean,&quot; in terms of manufacturing, he says, &quot;is necessary, but it is not enough.&quot; He thinks that in order for some European auto companies to prosper, there ought to be some that simply don't survive. 
That is, he thinks there needs to be higher volume production runs by fewer companies rather than lower volume runs by the existing companies. &quot;In order to get lower prices, the car makers need greater volumes,&quot; Rhys says.<BR>
Speaking of Wheels...</B>
<P>Quick: <BR>
Which of the Big Three uses the most aluminum wheels? <BR>
No, not the biggest carmaker, GM, but Ford, according to figures from Alloy Wheels International. <BR>
Ford installs 10.5 million aluminum wheels; <BR>
GM uses 9.8 million; <BR>
Chrysler: 4.1 million.
