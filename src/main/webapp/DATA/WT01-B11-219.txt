PETERBOROUGH -- The Ministry of Natural Resources, Trent University and Sir Sandford Fleming College today signed a new Partnership Agreement, focusing on the goals and mandates common to the three organizations, particulary in the areas of natural resources, environment, ecosystems management and related operations.<P> 

"Partnerships are key to achieving the ministry's primary goal of sustainable development of natural resources," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson.  "This partnership with Trent and Sir Sandford Fleming has been a priority for the ministry.  It is an excellent example of the spirit of cooperation the government wants to foster in building relationships with private and public agencies," Mr. Hodgson added.<P>

"Partnerships with the public and private sectors are an important priority for Trent as a means of strengthening our research and teaching capabilities," said Trent University President Leonard Conolly.  "Given Trent's recognized expertise in environmental studies, this new partnership makes perfect sense for the university and brings tangible benefits to all three organizations," Dr. Conolly added.<P> 

"This agreement provides an opportunity for Sir Sandford Fleming College to expand and enrich these relationships in ways which will better serve its students, the community and the citizens of Ontario," said Sir Sandford Fleming President Dr. Brian Desbiens.<P>

The Partnership Agreement is a statement of intent by the organizations to undertake ongoing discussion, maintain working committees, identify potential efficiencies and explore partnership opportunities in five broad categories:  strategic business development, community development/social integration, training/education, sharing resources and information, and co-operative research.<P> 

Initially, the agreement will be for five years, and may be renewed for another five years.<P>
