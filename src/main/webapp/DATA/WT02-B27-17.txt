<HR NOSHADE>



Altman is worried. He has no job prospects and he has little 

to show for a year of work in Francis Crick's laboratory

in Cambridge, England. Crick was the co-discoverer of DNA, the

molecule that encodes the genetic information that tells

cells how to function and grow. It's an incredible honour for

Altman to be invited to this famous laboratory. The year is 

1970, an unusually warm June day. At the moment, this laboratory

is probably the best place in the world for genetic

research, but Altman has only two weeks left before he must

leave. And he has no idea where he will go or 

what he will do next. 

<P>

Altman is working on mutant cells

with malfunctioning t-RNA (transfer Ribonucleic Acid)--a

substance that is part of the machinery in a cell that decodes

instructions in DNA. For about the thousandth time, Altman

picks up a thin layer of gel on a glass plate. But this one is 

special. Altman was trying a new experiment, something no one had

ever tried before. If he could just isolate a special type of RNA

called precursor-RNA it would explain everything else.

<P>
After putting a few drops of material prepared from

the mutant cells onto the gel, Altman places the plate into

a strong electric field--a standard technique for separating

chemical compounds called electrophoresis. Different compounds

move across the gel at different speeds because of the electric

field. Altman waits several hours, and then lays photographic

film on top of the gel. Tiny amounts of radioactive tracer atoms

in the RNA emit X-rays that will leave characteristic bands on the

film.

<P>
With a friend, Altman takes this latest piece of film into the

darkroom to develop it. Within minutes the two young scientists

both see it. It's just a white splotch on the negative

but it gives Altman one overwhelming thought, "Now I know I can

ultimately get a job." He had taken the first step in 

a long series of experiments that would ultimately lead to the

discovery of catalytic RNA.

<P>

Altman was hired for one more year in Crick's lab, then became a

biology professor at Yale University in USA. His discoveries 

over the next two decades have resulted in a Nobel prize

and could possibly even lead to a cure for the common cold. 

He is still working on aspects of the same molecular biology

system today.

<B>History</B>

</UL>


Sidney Altman grew up in the NDG suburb of Montreal.

As a boy he loved books. He liked sports and writing, too, but

the library was one of his

favourite places. He read everything: novels, sports books, and

science. His parents could always find the money if he wanted

to buy books. "I read everything I could get my hands on," says 

Altman. He spent a lot of time alone in his room reading.

<P>



When he was 12 years old someone gave him a book called "Explaining

The Atom" by Selig Hecht. The book showed Altman the

power of science to predict things. From then on he was a 

confirmed scientist. 

"I wasn't interested in Biology at the time. I liked nuclear physics,"

says Altman.

<P>

One saturday afternoon while Altman was still in high-school a

friend of his said, "Why don't you come with me to McGill. I'm

going to take the American SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Tests)." 

These tests are a required part of any application to an American

university. Altman always thought he would go to McGill for

University, but on a whim he wrote the SAT tests that afternoon

with his friend. They both applied to MIT (Massachusetts Institute

of Technology) and as it turned out, Altman got in but his friend

did not.

<P>

Altman's family had to scramble to get the money together to 

send him to this great American school, and he wasn't even sure

he wanted to go. There was a big debate in the Altman household. 

But Altman says, "Within three weeks at MIT I knew

I wanted to stay." He was impressed by the high caliber of the

other students and he really enjoyed living away from home.

At MIT he received a BSc. Then he:

<UL>

<LI>Went to the University of Colorado medical school where he got

a PhD in Molecular Biology and met Leonard Lerman.

<LI>Lerman introduced Altman to Francis Crick & S. Brenner in England.

<LI>Altman won a fellowship to work in Crick & Brenner's lab.

<LI>There, he made early discoveries that lead to the principle of Catalytic RNA.

<LI>Came back to USA and became a professor at Yale University.

Molecular biologists study the thousands of chemical reactions

that go on inside cells to create and sustain life. Altman specializes in the

chemical processes involved in copying information from DNA and

using it to make proteins, the building blocks of cells. Information 

is copied from DNA (Deoxy-riboNucleic Acid) by a molecule called 

RNA (RiboNucleic Acid). DNA and RNA are long twisty chain-like 

molecules. Actually, there are about six different types of RNA

involved in the transcription process. 

<P>

In Crick's lab, around 1970, Altman was investigating part 

of this complex process. He discovered an enzyme called "RNase P"

that chops a little "tail" off the end of an intermediate molecule 

of RNA called "precursor-tRNA". Enzymes are special protein molecules

that make chemical reactions go faster--a process called "catalysis".

They usually do this by holding or

bending a target molecule in a certain way so that one of its

chemical bonds breaks more easily. It took about a decade, but

Altman eventually discovered that the enzyme he was after was not your

average enzyme. Instead of being a protein like

all other enzymes, it was made of two 

parts--one strand of RNA and one protein. Furthermore it was the RNA portion 

that provided the catalysis. 

<P>

This was a significant discovery because RNA molecules are much

more primitive than protein molecules. Besides offering an 

explanation for how life might have begun billions of years ago

before proteins existed, it also hints at a way to beat a very troublesome

primitive life form: the virus for the common cold. It may be

possible to design catalytic RNA-based vaccines that kill cold

viruses by chopping up the RNA on which they are based.

Altman feels that perhaps the biggest mystery to be solved by the next
generation will be the understanding of the human brain.
