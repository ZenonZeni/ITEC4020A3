<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Technologies for capturing, using, and disposing of carbon dioxide (CO2) need to be considered as part of an overall strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming.  Systems that integrate coal gasification with combined-cycle power generation, combined with CO2-capture technologies, are an important option for future coal-based electricity supplies.  Integrated gasification/combined cycle (IGCC) systems feature high energy conversion efficiency.  Also, as shown by field studies, IGCC systems produce very low levels of sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides, which cause acid rain and other pollution problems.
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
Argonne National Laboratory's work emphasizes IGCC systems combined with CO2-capture technologies.  The entire fuel-cycle was considered, from mining the coal through CO2 pipeline transport and sequestering.  Commercial CO2-capture technology provided performance and economic baselines for comparing innovative technologies.

By taking an overview of the fuel cycle, it was possible to compare the overall impact of each stage of the cycle and assess its relative importance.  Process evaluation included contact with commercial vendors to refine the engineering assessments for available technologies.  These assessments identified potential problem areas and development needs, evaluated key process tradeoffs, and estimated costs for the technologies.
<P>
Commercial processes based on CO2 solubility in amines, glycol, and methanol were studied, as well as facilitated transport membranes (a still non-commercial technology).  Also considered were high-temperature technologies (for example, calcium- or magnesium-based sorbents and molten carbonate membranes).  CO2 recovery was set at 90%, and the combustion turbine was fed a high hydrogen-content fuel.  From the IGCC plant, a 500-km pipeline took the CO2 to geological sequestering.

<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
Results showed that the base IGCC plant was cheaper and more efficient than conventional pulverized coal-fired boilers.  However, Argonne found significant reductions in the IGCC plant's net electric power production.  For a 458-MW base case, these reductions ranged from 73.6 MW to 185.1 MW with a 0.29-0.53 kg/kWhe CO2 release rate (after considering makeup power).  Life-cycle CO2 sequestering costs were $113-201/ton of CO2, resulting in electricity costs that are 74-113% higher than the base case.

<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
Argonne will continue actively monitoring development of U.S. environmental policy related to greenhouse gases.
