As civil societies continued to blossom in the Americas, the press took its watchdog role seriously 
in 1995, helping to unravel corruption, impunity and abuse of power in the region.<BR>
<BR>
But in doing so, the news media became targets of retaliation from the corrupt ruling 
classes, politicians and criminals who often were the focus of their stories. During 
the year, 10<STRONG> </STRONG>
journalists were killed because of their work, and one other murder is unconfirmed; 
and in at least 60 other incidents, journalists were imprisoned, beaten, shot at 
or threatened with death.<BR>
<BR>
The level of violence against the press was not as high as it had been in previous 
years, but the involvement of organized crime became a worrisome new trend, especially 
in Guatemala, Colombia, Mexico, Brazil and Paraguay. Even in Canada, where criminal 
biker gangs have built up a profitable market in barbiturates, a reporter was shot 
in the knees by gang members angered by his coverage of their drug dealing.<BR>
<BR>
In countries like Guatemala and Colombia, where criminals have acted with impunity 
for decades as a result of the judicial disorder caused by civil strife, many attacks 
against the press were carried out with the knowledge or participation of corrupt 
army and police officers. Guatemalan army officers known to have committed human rights 
violations during the civil war, for instance, have stepped into criminal rings of 
kidnappers, car thieves and drug traffickers. Journalists who took on these issues 
faced abuses that were sometimes filed away as common crimes but which ultimately were 
tied to their work.<BR>
<BR>
A similar pattern evolved along the U.S.-Mexico border, where cases of overnment officials 
are the suspected assassins or intellectual authors of the killings. All the murders 
occurred in the interior of the country--further evidence that although a free and robust press works unabated in principal cities, provincial reporters work with 
little protection.<BR>
<BR>
In Brazil, where four journalists were killed for uncovering corruption and environmental 
abuses, policemen and local government officials are the suspected assassins or intellectual 
authors of the killings. All the murders occurred in the interior of the country--further evidence that although a free and robust press works unabated in 
principal cities, provincial reporters work with little protection.<BR>
<BR>
The governments of Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile tried to introduce legislation 
restricting the news media. In Argentina and Chile, where the press has won considerable 
leverage, these efforts were thwarted by public protests from influential media organizations. At year's end, the government of Colombian President Ernesto Samper, 
who continued to rule despite serious allegations that he received money from drug 
cartels, imposed press restrictions that forbade the media from carrying any statements 
made by leftist guerrillas, drug traffickers and common criminals. <BR>
<BR>
By the end of 1995, Peru was the only country in the hemisphere with imprisoned journalists. 
Eight who were unfairly accused of collaborating with terrorists remain in jail, 
serving sentences of up to 20 years.<BR>
<BR>
Good news came from Costa Rica, where the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional 
the licensing of journalists. The decision ended a 30-year reign by the Colegio de 
Periodistas, which had ruled that only journalists with a Costa Rican university 
degree could work legally in the country. Costa Rica's licensing model is one that has been 
in use or under serious consideration in several other Latin American countries, 
and it is hoped that the court ruling will encourage other nations to reconsider 
the licensing issue.<BR>
<BR>
In another positive development, journalists in several countries organized to combat 
attacks on the media. Most of these efforts were modeled after the Peruvian Institute 
of Press and Society (IPYS), which, since its inception in 1994, has helped reduce 
press abuses in Peru with timely intervention and international backing. In Colombia, 
a group of journalists led by Nobel laureate Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez created a press 
defense committee at a meeting co-sponsored by CPJ. And in Cuba, independent journalists created their own press agencies and fought for the right to publish their work 
outside the country since the state-run media will not accept stories from reporters 
blacklisted by the government.<BR>

<H5>SPECIAL REPORT</H5>

<A NAME="Cuba"><H2>Cuba: Seeds of a Free Press</H2></A>

by Ana Arana<BR>
<BR>
Ever since the Cuban revolution 36 years ago, the Castro government has viewed the press as its mouthpiece; media 
censorship has been as much a part of Cuban life as food lines. But that notion is 
being challenged by a group of out-of-work, independent journalists who were fired 
from their official jobs because of irreverent thinking about the revolution and its future.<BR>
<BR>
They have begun to market stories in the United States and Europe about their nation 
via the Bureau of Independent Press of Cuba (BPIC), a sort of clearinghouse that 
was founded by the journalist Yndamiro Restano, who was recently released from prison.<BR>
<BR>
Independent journalism, even for overseas audiences, remains a dangerous task. In 
October, as President Fidel Castro wined and dined in New York City during the United 
Nations' 50th anniversary celebrations, Olance Nogueras Roce, a 27-year-old reporter 
working for BPIC, was detained four times, placed under house arrest and threatened 
with a prison term for spreading news that allegedly undermined "international peace." 
Nogueras' offense was writing a story that was widely distributed by BPIC on the 
potential safety problems at Cuba's Juraguas nuclear plant. Nogueras was told to leave 
the country or face persecution. He refused, and his colleagues fear that his case 
will be used as a test by the government as it attempts to control them.<BR>
<BR>
Still, Restano maintains that Castro has given independent journalism some room to 
operate. "It is very small, but we must keep it open," he says. One thing that has 
changed, despite the danger, is the building of an esprit de corps among the journalists. In recent months, in an effort to create a semblance of a free press, they have formed 
or revitalized small, loosely organized journalists' groups with names like Havana 
Press and Cuba Press. And throughout the Nogueras episode, for example, Rafael Solano, who runs Havana Press, continued filing stories through BPIC about Nogueras' situation. 
(Solano had been at the pinnacle of Cuban journalism, writing news for Cuba's most 
important radio station, when he was fired in early 1995.)<BR>
<BR>
Restano's release from prison in June 1995 was the catalyst for the new solidarity 
among independent Cuban journalists. Back in 1985, Restano had challenged the concept 
of state-controlled media and was banished from official journalism, forcing him 
to work menial jobs. He went on to found Cuba's first nonofficial journalism organization 
in 1987. He later founded a human rights movement seeking peaceful political change 
and was sentenced to prison for distributing information about it. A campaign by 
the Committee to Protect Journalists and other press freedom organizations and the direct 
intercession of Danielle Mitterrand, wife of France's former president, led to his 
release. Afterwards, Restano traveled in Europe and Latin America and found there 
was great interest in the little-known world of dissident Cuban journalists. At the annual 
meeting of the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) on Oct. 15, leading Latin 
American and U.S. publishers accepted the journalists' application for membership. 
Several IAPA members have since published articles by the dissidents. "We believe that 
our support for their cause at this moment is elementary for their future survival," 
says David Lawrence, Jr., publisher of the <CITE>Miami Herald </CITE>
and the new president of IAPA.<BR>
<BR>
Restano and his colleagues hope that eventually they will be able to launch an independent 
radio station or newspaper<CITE> inside </CITE>
Cuba. "That's the goal that keeps us going," he says. Cubans in general have lost 
respect for state news, but the alternatives are generally not politically independent 
either. Most of the population listen to Miami radio stations, which are often owned 
or operated by hard-line Cuban exiles. Even the U.S. government-sponsored Radio Mart&iacute; 
has as its chairman Jorge Mas Canosa, the controversial Cuban exile who opposes any 
opening to Cuba while Castro is in power. <BR>
<BR>
Can an independent press project survive in Cuba? Restano and his colleagues believe 
so. "It is the only way we can help change our system from an authoritarian government 
to a democratic one, without violence," he says. "A free press could help keep the 
good things the revolution brought to our society and get rid of the bad ones."<BR>
