No matter what the technical safety or health issues-from fire
and emergency training required at 29 CFR 191038 and .157 to the
proposed standard for TB-OSHA expects the employer to provide a
basic level of safety education and training to exposed
employees. This expectation is reflected in the last four
elements that make up OSHA&#146;s 1989 voluntary <i>Guidelines
for Safety and Health Program Management</i>, which we have been
reviewing the past editions of <i>Today&#146;s Workplace</i>.</p>

<p>At the minimum, employees must understand the hazards to which
they may be exposed and how to prevent harm to themselves and
others. This understanding helps employees accept and follow your
established protections for specific hazards. For example, it is
hard for employees first entering the healthcare professions to
understand the need for all of the personal protective
equipment-masks, goggles, gloves &amp; gowns-which are standard
protocol. Education concerning the vectors of disease
transmission between patient and caregiver provides the
foundation for training on exactly when and how to use such
equipment.</p>

<p>While all employees need hazard awareness education and
training, supervisors and managers require added information.
Supervisors should be given special training to help them in
their leadership roles. They need to be taught to look for hidden
hazards, to insist upon the safe maintenance of their work areas,
and to reinforce employee hazard training through performance
feedback and, when necessary, fair and consistent enforcement of
organizational rules.</p>

<p>Managers must understand their own responsibilities for safety
and health. They may not need to attend classroom training on
hazards. However, organizations should provide their managers
with multiple sources of information that will raise safety and
health awareness. Seminars, workshops, information bulletins,
newsletters and vides are suitable.</p>

<p>Is your plan for safety and health education and training
up-to-date? Is it responsive to each employee&#146;s exposures,
duties and position within your facility? Your SIS loss control
consultant can help you evaluate and design appropriate training
strategies. In addition, SIS can schedule specially designed
workshops for your management and supervisory staff. Call your
SIS loss control consultant and ask for the &quot;On-Site
Educational Programs&quot; information.</p>
