<I>The Weekly Money Report (continued)<BR>
July 29, 1996</I>

<P>



The slowdown in the high technology sector is of greater important than in the
past because of the role which it has played in sustaining growth since 1994 as
demand for autos and housing slowdown.<p>
Business expenditures on office and computer machinery now accounts for about
1.8% of real GDP compared to 0.6% during 1990 and less than 0.2% during the
early 1980's.  Its nominal share of GDP is about 1.0% compared to 0.7% in 1990
and 1.1% in 1984.  According to Hewlett Packard, the nominal growth rate of
computer spending could slow to 0-5% by the first quarter of 1997.  Under such
a scenario, the real growth rate would drop to about 5-10% from 30-40% during
1995 and early 1996.  While such a slowdown will represent a major negative
swing from the sector's previous growth rate, it is by no means an
unprecedented adjustment.  During the mid-1980's, the growth rate of office and
computer equipment spending fluctuated in a range of plus 80% at annual rates
to only slightly positive growth.  In the 1990 recession, real spending
actually fell by over 20%.<p>
<p>
The other investment sector which has enjoyed buoyant during recent years is
communications equipment.  It's share of real GDP has expanded to .95%  from
.7% during 1992 and a previous peak of just under 1.0% during the mid-1980's.
The growth rate of communications equipment investment has already slowed from
25% during mid-1994 to 6-7% recently.<p>
<p>
<i>Since the economy's two most vulnerable high technology sectors account for
less than 3.0% of GDP, they will not be able to change the economy's overall
direction if other sectors are enjoying moderate growth.</i>   The correction
occurring in high technology capital investment is a far more important
phenomena for the stock market than for the economy because of the leadership
role which technology companies have played in the market during recent
years.<p>
<p>
As a result of the buoyant outlook for corporate profits and the high level of
capacity utilization rates, other capital spending sectors should continue to
enjoy moderate growth this year.  Industrial equipment accounts for about 1.8%
of both nominal and real GDP.  It has already slowed from a growth rate of over
15% during late 1994 to about 6-7% recently.  The truck and bus sector of
equipment investment is highly cyclical and has already experienced a major
adjustment.  Its growth rate has dropped from a peak of nearly 40% in late 1993
to only 2-3% recently.  The sector has a history of experiencing sub-cycle
contractions even during periods of steady growth in the economy, so it could
continue to decline during the second half of 1996 and then could rebound
during 1997 (as it did during the sub-cycle of the mid-1980's).<p>
<p>
The arguments for the Fed to tighten in the face of these risks to final demand
growth center on inflation expectations in the private sector and the
uncertainty which exists about the magnitude of any late 1996 slowdown in the
midst of a financial environment which appears to be highly supportive of
growth.<p>
<p>
The Fed has been able to fine tune the economy during the 1990's without
risking a recession in part because of the confidence which it enjoys among
investors and business decision makers.  If they saw the Fed remaining passive
in the face of rising wages in order to sustain a prolonged period of full
employment, they would start to increase their forecasts of the intermediate
term inflation outlook.  While the adjustments might be small at first, there
would be a clear and increasing tendency for analyst to assume a core inflation
rate closer to 4.0% than 3.0% by late 1997.<p>
<p>
While there are numerous reasons why final demand could slow in some important
sectors during the next nine months, <i>the financial environment in the U.S.
remains so buoyant that it is difficult to imagine a prolonged period of output
growth below 2.0%.</i>  Banks are competing so aggressively to make loans that
most small business owners can now chose between four and five potential
lenders if they have to finance a new investment or a sale of their business.
The boom in the stock market and the expansion of the mutual fund industry has
produced a very buoyant environment for new equity IPO's and the sale of
non-investment grade bonds.  The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the
first half of 1996 compared to 573 during all of 1995, 571 during 1994, and a
peak of 665 during 1993.  These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2 billion during the
first half of 1996 compared to $28.9 billion last year, $22.9 billion during
1994 and $34.0 billion during 1993.  The peak for I.P.O. financing during the
1980's, by contrast, was $17.7 billion during 1986.  The search for higher
yields also has helped to revitalize the so-called junk bond market.  In the
first half of 1996, Wall Street sold 92 new non-investment grade bond offering
compared to 159 during 1995, 190 during 1994, and 343 during 1993.  The funds
raised were $17.1 billion during the first half of 1996, $28.8 billion during
1995, $31.5 billion during 1994, and $54.4 billion during 1993.  The previous
peak in non-investment grade bond financing was 218 deals worth $30.5 billion
during 1986.  <p>
<p>
It is difficult to imagine a self-reinforcing slowdown when capital is so
readily available to the entrepreneurial companies responsible for most of
America's job creation.  Meanwhile, the appreciation of the stock market has
boosted the net worth of the household sector by almost $2 billion since 1994.
If the household sector spends only 5% of its capital gains, the potential
boost to consumer spending is $100 billion.  The correction now occurring  in
the equity market will inhibit new wealth creation but the market has been
robust for so long that wealth losses are unlikely to be a depressing influence
on household spending until next year.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u><b>Are the Financial Markets Focusing on the Election?</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The major focus of media commentary about the stock market during July was the
risk that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates.  <i>But equity
investors were probably also concerned about the continuing poor performance of
former Senator Robert Dole in the presidential opinion polls.</i>  Dole has
performed so poorly in the polls that there is growing concern about the
ability of the Republican Party to retain control of Congress.  Wall Street has
long perceived the president to be a superior campaigner but investors had
expected Dole to benefit from the conviction of the Governor of Arkansas  for
corruption in June as well as his resignation from the Senate.  Clinton's
seeming immunity to his scandals has so unnerved the Republicans that they are
about to announce a major tax cut program in order to bolster Dole's electoral
appeal.  As Dole has devoted his whole career to reducing federal deficits and
criticizing supply side economists, it is far from clear that the new strategy
will work but his new tax proposals will at least allow him to reinvoke the
optimistic message of Ronald Reagan during the early 1980's.<p>
<p>
<i>The August political conventions will provide the next important test of
investor sentiment about the election.</i>  As political conventions focus
great media attention on candidates, they typically give a boost to the
challenger who is attempting to establish credibility as an alternative to the
incumbent.  As Clinton is already 15-20 points ahead, investor concern about
Dole will evolve into alarm about both the presidential and congressional races
if he does not emerge from the convention narrowing the gap with Clinton by at
least 10 points.<p>
<p>
The prospect of the Republicans losing control of Congress is potentially
disturbing to Wall Street for three reasons,<p>
<p>
<i>First, the 1996 election poses a unique historic challenge for both
parties.</i>  No Democratic president has won two consecutive elections since
Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930's.  The Republican Party has not controlled the
Congress for  two consecutive terms since the 1920's.  If the Republicans lose
control again in 1996, it will suggest that the public is turning away from
their themes of deficit reduction, slowing growth of entitlement spending, and
promoting lower marginal income tax rates.<p>
<p>
Secondly, there has been a profound change in the character of the Democratic
Party in the Congress as a result of recent Republican victories.  <i>The
Republican Party now has 77 of the 125 house seats of the old southern
Confederacy compared to 48 in 1992, 34 in 1972 and 6 in 1960.</i>  On the basis
of pending Democratic retirements, the Republicans may even be able to claim
control over two thirds of the seats in the south by next year even if they
lose their overall majority.  As a result of the Republican takeover of the
south, the Democrats now depend far more upon the urban centers of the
northeast, the middle west and California for their congressional membership.
<i>This geographic shift in the composition of the parties suggests that future
Democratic committee chairman would be far more supportive of federal spending
programs and other forms of government intervention in the economy than both
the current Republican chairmen and past Democratic chairmen.</i><p>
