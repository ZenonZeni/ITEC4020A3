<p><strong>Funding & Milestones</strong>
<P>
In one sense, this collaborative program is guided by representatives of all its participants in
national laboratories, industry, and universities. More specifically, PV Program managers in
DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, and in the <a href="rescen.html">national laboratories</a>, develop comprehensive operating plans based on strategic, multiyear plans that
respond to the broad policies for energy R&D determined by the executive and legislative
branches of the federal government. 
<P>
Through sound management practices and continual fine-tuning, program managers ensure that
the budget allocations, direction, and individual elements of the National Photovoltaics Program
meet the objectives of the nation and stay on target. Individual project and research managers at
the national laboratories and DOE's field offices administer both in-house research and cost-shared R&D contracts with the private sector. Federal funding for the PV Program was $60
million in fiscal year 1996. Industrial partners typically cost-share the contract research efforts
50-50 in the program. In addition, private-sector investments in developing manufacturing
facilities exceed the government investment in R&D by a factor of 2 or more. Other investments
and new financing are also crucial to our success. Large national and multinational projects
require the participation of international development and financing organizations.

research and development, technology development, and systems engineering and applications.
