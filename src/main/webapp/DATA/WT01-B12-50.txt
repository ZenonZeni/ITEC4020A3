 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> INNER ACT</H2>

<P>Herbs  have  been used  since  creation  to provide for our health and well being, for entire civilizations for that matter. The Bible tells us that we were given herbs for healing and cites many examples of their usage.  Main stream modern technology is now finally beginning to focus on herbs and natural plant therapies.  This is usually referred to in the literature today  as phytotherapy.  We probably never will understand many of the secrets regarding how many natural extracts and concentrates work, but that is no reason to not take advantage of their benefits now.</P>
<P>  To our knowledge, Life Plus is the only company that manufactures and distributes the unique kinds of herbal-based-products we do by combining high quality herbs from all over the world with other synergistic nutrients known to work toward the same specific   nutritional   goals.  These synergistic nutrients include vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, bioflavonoids, phytonutrients, anti-oxidants, and, at times, concentrated tissue nutrients.  By combining modern technology with classical herbal knowledge, the Life Plus herbal-based-products are second to none anywhere in the world.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> UNIQUE COMBINATION</H2>
<P>  INNER ACT is a unique combination of herbs and herbal extracts, which can be a very important product if you need it. The lack of fiber in the diets of most individuals today often results in the muscles of their colons not receiving adequate "stretching" because of a lack of bulk.   As a result, they do not get enough stimulation for contraction which can result in too slow movement of food through the lower digestive tract. This is usually referred to as a sluggish colon.</P>
<P>  INNER ACT contains ten herbal ingredients. They include Rhubarb Root, Licorice Root, Fennel Seed and Anise Seed. The Irish Moss in INNER ACT contains a high proportion of a natural gum that lubricates and soothes the colon and absorbs toxins. A small amount of dehydrated Prune Concentrate is also included.</P>
<P>  Prune Concentrate contains a high percentage of natural compounds that are known to be good detoxifiers and cleansers and it also helps to stimulate peristalsis (movement of the muscles in the colon helping the process of elimination). Parsley is a natural cleanser and works well with the other herbs in this preferred preparation.</P>
<P>  The predominant herbal ingredients in INNER ACT are Cascara Sagrada Bark and Senna Leaf Powder. These two herbs have been used for many decades as natural herbal laxatives.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
 <P> INNER ACT is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus PhytoZyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.
  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO USE INNER ACT</H2>
<P>  A high percentage of older people love INNER ACT because they often have sluggish colons.   They comment that they have more energy and feel better when they take steps to ensure that their lower digestive tracts (colons) stay cleaned out.  Many of them do not have  regular elimination.    But  many  younger people have the same problem, including teenagers.</P>
<P>  It is strongly recommended that almost everyone use <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> every day and then take INNER ACT when needed. In general, it is a good idea to take INNER ACT for one or two days each month. Some people may need it weekly. You will have to be your own judge and tailor its use to your needs.</P>
<P>   Usually two to four tablets are taken at one time. It is recommended to take them at bedtime.  Usually an elimination will occur the next morning. It is not recommended to take them in the morning or afternoon as elimination may occur during the day.</P>
<P>  In the past it has been thought that consistent use of INNER ACT could result in dependence. This, of course, is of consideration when it, or any other laxative, is used on a daily basis, over a long period of time.  We have not seen this to be a problem and recommend that you concentrate on eating a natural diet as much as possible, take <A HREF="mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A> daily, walk a reasonable amount each day and take Life Plus INNER ACT as needed.</P>

Suggested Use:  Two to four tablets at bedtime as needed to produce a gentle elimination the next 
morning. Some individuals may need more. </P>
