<h4>Revision of the "Use By" Guidance Notes</h4>

The UK food labelling  regulations require all prepacked foods which are microbiologically highly perishable and which, as a result, are likely to pose an immediate danger to human health to be marked with a "use by" date.  The Ministry has produced guidance on the use of this mark to ensure a uniform approach by industry and to avoid consumer confusion.
<p>
The notes were last revised in 1993.  The latest draft takes into account the provisions of the Food Safety (Temperature Control) Regulations 1995.  The Ministry has asked for comments on the draft revised notes by 1st November 1996.

<h4>Proposed Amendments to the Plastic Materials and Articles in Contact with Food Regulations 1992</h4>

Following the adoption of a further EC Directive (96/11) on plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (which amends the earlier Directive (90/128)), proposals have been issued for its implementation into UK legislation.
<p>
The main effects of the amendments are:
<ul>
<li>to add to the incomplete list of additives
<li>to amend the list of monomers and other starting substances
<li>to extend the life of some list B monomers and other starting substances until 1 January 2002, and
<li>to amend the prohibition from "trade in and use" to "manufacture and importation into the Community" to take into account long life plastics made with list B substances
</ul><p>
It is proposed to issue amendment Regulations late in 1996 to come into effect on the 1 January 1997.

<h4>Draft Retail Industry Guide to Good Hygiene Practice </h4>

The 1995 Food Safety (General Food Hygiene) Regulations allow for the issuing of Codes of Good Hygiene Practice which are recognised by the Ministers as providing guidance on the action to be taken to comply with the requirements of the Regulations.  This type of document is based on provisions in Article 5 off the Directive on the Hygiene of Foodstuffs (EEC/93/43).
<p>
A Draft Retail Industry Guide to Good Hygiene Practice has now been circulated for comment.  It has been prepared by a Working Party consisting of the British Retail Consortium, National Association of Master Bakers, Scottish Grocers Federation with input from LACOTS and the Department of Health.
<p>
The draft is based on a "template" for such Codes produced by the Department of Health.  In addition to providing guidance on the General Food Hygiene Regulations, it also provides guidance on compliance with the 1995 Food Safety (Temperature Control) Regulations.
<p>
The British Retail Consortium is leading the Working Group and copies of the draft are available from them at Bedford House, 69/79 Fulham High Street, London SW6 3JW.  The consultation period ends on 29 November 1996.

<h4>Proposed Meat Products (Hygiene)(Amendment) Regulations 1996</h4>

The Ministry is proposing to issue Regulations which would amend the Meat Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1994.  Many of the proposed amendments result from the adoption of Directive 95/68 agreed in December 1995 and which amended Directive 77/99.
<p>
The Ministry letter indicates that there are 4 main aspects to the proposed changes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Some deregulatory measures (e.g. a provision to allow the disinfection of transport vehicles at a site away from the meat products premises, and a derogation from requiring offices to be provided in plants where the enforcement officer is not required to be permanently present).

<li>Measures which have already been introduced on an administrative basis by guidance etc. (e.g. allowing unwrapped/packaged products which are sold in bulk to bear the health mark on the bulk container and the accompanying documentation).

<li> Other measures (e.g. acceptance that in areas where dry mixing of products is performed cleaning and disinfection processes need not make use of water,)

<li> Corrections (e.g. correction of a typographical error and the removal of references to the Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulations 1984).
</ol>
<p>
The consultation period ends on the 25 September with Regulations expected later in the year.

<h4>Enforcement Codes of Practice</h4>

Two new enforcement Codes of Practice (numbers 19 and 20) have been issued under Section 40 of the Food Safety Act and a revised version of Code number 8.
<p>
<b>Code of Practice No. 19: Qualifications and Experience of Authorised Officers and Experts.</b>
<p>
This Code sets out the obligations on food authorities which are necessary to meet the requirements of the Additional Food Control Measures Directive (93/99) which supplemented the controls contained in the Official Control of Foodstuffs Directive (89/397).  Article 2 of the Directive 93/99 states:<br>
	"<i>Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities have, or have access to, a sufficient number of suitably qualified and experienced staff, in particular in areas such as chemistry, food chemistry, veterinary medicine, medicine, food microbiology, food hygiene, food technology and law so that the controls referred to in Article 5 of Directive 89/397/EEC can be adequately carried out.</i>"
<p>
The Code requires the authorities to ensure that all officers are qualified and experienced and then goes on to indicate which qualifications are considered appropriate.  It also points out that officers need to have a sound knowledge of the general principles in criminal law and enforcement practice which would include the due diligence/reasonable precautions defences and the rules which relate to interviewing persons.  Guidance is given on the continued employment of officers who do not have the specified qualifications.
<p>
<b>Code of Practice No 20:  Exchange of Information between Member States of the EU on Routine Food Control Matters</b>
<p>
As with Code 19 above, this Code arises out of the requirements of Directive 93/99.  Article 6 of the Directive requires Member States to provide assistance in the supervision of food law and in all proceeding for infringements of food law.  It also requires the appointment of a single liaison body which will assist and co-ordinate communication.
<p>
LACOTS has been designated as the UK liaison body but central government will maintain a supervisory role and will be responsible for action for certain matters.  Information is given on the action to be taken by a food authority when they receive a request for assistance and when they require assistance from another Member State.
<p>
The Code indicates the important procedures to be followed when obtaining information which could be used as evidence in court proceedings.  In these cases, the provisions of the "European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters" apply (with the exception of Ireland) and consent must be obtained via the UK Central Authority which is part of the Judicial Co-operation Unit of the Home Office.
<p>
<b>Code of Practice No 8 (Revised):  Food Standards Inspections</b>
<p>
This revised Code emphasises the role of enforcement officers in advising food businesses on how to comply with the law; sates the need to ensure that such officers are properly qualified; and the co-ordinating role of bodies such as LACOTS and local authority liaison groups.  It includes an "inspection rating scheme" which is considered appropriate for allocating a risk to premises and, based on the risk, it indicates a minimum frequency of inspection.  For the purposes of this code, "food standards" means legal requirements covering the quality, composition, labelling, presentation and advertising of food and of materials or articles in contact with food.

<h4>Proposed Amendment to the Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula Regulations 1995</h4>

The Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula Regulations 1995 (SI 1995/77) implemented the EC Directive on the subject (91/321/EEC).  An amendment to the Directive was adopted in early 1996 (96/4/EC) and the consultation letter contains details of how the amendment will be implemented into UK legislation.
<p>
It is proposed to issue Infant Formula and Follow-on Formula (Amendment) Regulations later this year to be effective from 1 January 1997.  The main changes are:
<ul>
<li>changes to the labelling
<li>changes to compositional criteria
<li>new reference values for nutrition labelling for foods intended for infants and young children
</ul>
<p>
There is intended to be a transitional period until 31 March 1999 during which time infant formula and follow-on formula which met the requirements of the Regulations before amendment, can still be sold.

<h4>BSE - Government Statement Relating to Sheep</h4>

Douglas Hogg, Minister of Agriculture at MAFF made the following statement on transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE's) to Parliament today.
<p>
"Scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of sheep and goats, has been known for over 200 years.  There is no evidence that it is linked to Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease (CJD) in humans.  CJD occurs at approximately the same level in countries with and without scrapie.
<p>
"I have recently received advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) that BSE could, theoretically, become established in the sheep flock.  They note that in experiments (the results of which have been published) one out of six sheep experimentally challenged orally with BSE brain material succumbed to an encephalopathy; and that when their brain material was tested in mice the same strain type as BSE was found.  They note also the possibility that some sheep could have been exposed to feed contaminated with the BSE agent before the ruminant feed ban was introduced in 1988.
<p>
"The Committee point out that there is no evidence of BSE occurring naturally in the sheep flock. However the SEAC concern is, whilst there is no evidence to this effect, scrapie might be masking BSE in the sheep flock.  On the basis of present knowledge SEAC have made three recommendations.
<p>
"Firstly, that the Government should consider this issue further with EU partners.  We have started that process.  We are keeping in close contact with the French Government, whose scientific committee equivalent to SEAC has made certain recommendations on the basis of the laboratory evidence about BSE in sheep, and of concerns about scrapie.  At the Agriculture Council on 22 July Commissioner Fischler announced that the Commission intends to formulate proposals for the removal of certain offals of sheep, goats and deer from the human and animal food chain.  These proposals are to be considered initially by the Standing Veterinary Committee in early August, and then by other EU expert committees.
<p>
"SEAC's second recommendation was that the Government should give early consideration to removing the brains of sheep, whatever their source, over six months, from the human food chain.  The agriculture departments are today issuing for consultation a proposal for the heads of all sheep and goats to be removed and destroyed in the same way as specified bovine material. This measure would go rather further than SEAC suggested, taking into account the practical difficulty of distinguishing the age of sheep at slaughter.  It should not have a major economic impact as the vast majority of sheep's heads are already destroyed.  It is worth noting that sheepmeat for human consumption comes predominantly from young lambs under 12 months.
<p>
"We intend to reach a final decision in the light of responses to this consultation and to progress of EU discussion.  Action on this issue at EU level would be preferable, but it is desirable that these measures are put in place promptly.  There is no direct threat to human health; the action now being proposed is precautionary, to respond to what appears no more than a theoretical risk.
<p>
"SEAC's third recommendation is that further research should be done to establish the levels of scrapie occurring naturally in sheep and to further investigate the risks of BSE transmission to the UK sheep flock.  We accept this.  Some relevant research has already begun.
<p>
I emphasise that these steps are being taken out of an abundant of caution.  There is no direct threat to human health.  With the exception of the consumption of brains, there is absolutely no reason for anybody to change their eating habits.  I repeat: there is no evidence at all that in field conditions BSE has got into the national flock; but as that possibility cannot be wholly excluded we are proposing to take these precautionary measures.
<p>

<h4>MEAT HYGIENE SERVICE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 1995/96</h4>
 
The Meat Hygiene Service's Annual Report and Accounts for 1995/96 have been published. This is the Agency's first Annual Report. It includes a factual account of the functions, activities and achievements of the Agency during its first year of operation, summarises future plans and includes fully audited Accounts.
<p>
Mr Johnston McNeill, Chief Executive of the Meat Hygiene Service said "The Meat Hygiene Service has been in existence for just over a year.  The Annual Report and Accounts documents the tremendous progress made by the Agency during this first year of operation. The successes of the first year, and the laying of a sound foundation for the future, are a reflection of the quality of the Agency's staff ".
<p> 
Exceptionally, the Annual Report also includes a section on BSE which describes the enforcement role of the Agency. The State Veterinary Service (SVS) carries out frequent, unannounced visits to all beef plants to monitor the work of the MHS in ensuring that Specified Bovine Material (SBM) controls are rigorously enforced. This section documents the failures, many of which are of a relatively minor nature, identified by the State Veterinary Service in the enforcement of SBM controls since September 1995. In view of its front-line position in enforcing BSE controls in licensed premises, the MHS wishes to keep all its customers informed of the actions it has taken to ensure rigorous enforcement of the controls in beef slaughterhouses.
<p><i> 
Background Notes</i>
<p>
The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS), an Executive Agency of  the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF), was launched on 1 April 1995. It took over from some 300 local authorities responsibility for enforcing meat hygiene, inspection and animal welfare at slaughter legislation in 1,875 licensed fresh meat premises in England, Scotland and Wales. Public health and animal welfare are safeguarded in plants by Official Veterinary Surgeons and Meat Inspectors working as inspection teams. The MHS headquarters is based in York and there are six Regional Offices located at Cambridge, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Taunton, Wolverhampton and York.
<p>
The MHS is also responsible for enforcing BSE controls, notably the enhanced specified bovine material (SBM) controls in licensed beef plants, and supervision of the Over Thirty Month and Calf Processing schemes.
<p>
The State Veterinary Service (SVS) carries out frequent, unannounced visits to all beef plants to monitor the work of the MHS in ensuring that SBM controls are rigorously enforced. These audits have identified a number of failures. Many are of a relatively minor nature and relate to problems with staining or with record keeping.  As such they would not present a direct risk to public or animal health. There has been a dramatic and sustained reduction in the number of unsatisfactory SVS visits to inspect SBM controls in beef plants since September 1995.
<p>
Copies of the MHS's Annual Report and Accounts 1995/96 may be purchased from branches of HMSO.

<h4>Amendments to Bread and Flour Regulations</h4>

The Government has issued the Bread and Flour (Amendment) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996 No 1501).  They amend the Bread and Flour Regulations 1995 (SI 1995 No 3202) so as to remove the controls on the use of enzyme preparations in the manufacture of bread.

<h4>Deregulation (Improvement of Enforcement Procedures)(Food Safety Act 1990) Order 1996</h4>

Using powers contained in the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 (DCOA), the Government has issued an Order which requires enforcement authorities to issue a "Notice Prior to Service of an Improvement Notice" before issuing an Improvement Notice.
<p>
This notice will give food business proprietors a period, specified in the notice (a minimum of 14 days has been suggested , but is not stated in the Order), in which they will have the right to make either written or oral representations to the enforcement authority about the proposed enforcement action before an improvement notice can be served.  If the proprietor wishes to make oral representation, he or she will need to contact the enforcement authority within a fixed period of days (a minimum of 7 days has been suggested) to arrange the necessary meeting.
<p>
The Ministry letter states that "the Order formalizes good enforcement principles which are already recognized by many local authorities and serves to make these a legal obligation.  It also reflects the Government's policy to extend the provisions of the DCOA to all enforcement areas, bringing food safety into line with arrangements already made in other areas such as the Health and Safety at Work Act."
<p>
The Order comes into force on the 19 July 1996.

<h4>Consultation on Draft Guidance on Information about Infant Feeding</h4>

The Department of Health has issued a draft of a booklet which will offer guidance on two issues arising from the adoption of the EC Directive 91/321/EEC on Infant Formulae and Follow-on Formulae which was implemented in the UK by the Infant Formulae and Follow-on Formulae Regulations 1995 (SI No 77).
<p>
The Directive requires that "Member States shall ensure that objective and consistent information is provided on infant and young child feeding for use by families and those involved in the field of infant and young child nutrition".  The booklet will provided detailed guidance on how this should happen in the UK.
<p>
Regulation 21 of the UK Regulations includes reference to "guidelines drawn up the Secretary of State" on the donation of equipment and/or informational and educational materials by manufacturers and distributors of infant formula.  The booklet will set out the circumstances under which such donations can be made.
<p>
The Department has asked that comments on the Guidance should be made by September 10th.

<h4>Amendments to Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995</h4>

Regulations to amend the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 were laid before Parliament 1 July 1996. They are intended to come into force on 22 July.
<p>
The main features of the regulations (the Dairy Products (Hygiene) (Amendment) Regulations) are:<br>
<ul>
<li>an  upper limit of 2 million litres per year for businesses benefiting from structural and equipment derogations in the Regulations;
<li>introduction of certain conditions (such as keeping of records) for businesses benefiting from these derogations; 
<li>introduction of the EC list of third countries approved for the export of milk and milk based products to the European Union
</ul><p>
The Regulations implement EC Commission Decisions 95/165 and 95/340. They also make minor corrections to the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations.

<h4>New Lot Marking Regulations 1996</h4>

New Food (Lot Marking) Regulations 1996 come into force on the 1 July 1996 (SI 1996 No 1502).  The Regulations revoke and replace the Food (Lot Marking) Regulations 1992.  The new Regulations implement Directive 89/396 as amended.  They continue the requirements that food which has been produced, prepared or packaged as part of a lot is marked or labelled so as to enable the lot to be identified.  The Regulations have been made with a view to simplifying the 1992 Regulations.<p>
<hr>
<a name="96-13"></a><i>1 July 1996</i>

<h4>New Food Labelling Regulations 1996</h4>

New Food Labelling Regulations (SI 1996 No 1499) have been issued and came into effect on the 1 July 1996.  They consolidate and replace:<br>
<ul>
<li>the Food Labelling Regulations 1984
<li>the Food Labelling (Scotland) Regulations 1984
<li>the Milk Labelling (Scotland) Regulations 1983.
</ul>
<p>
The main purpose of the Regulations is to implement Council Directive 79/112/EEC but they also incorporate the requirements of :<br>
<ul>
<li>Commission Directive 87/250/EEC on the indication of alcoholic strength by volume in the labelling of alcoholic beverages for sale to the ultimate consumer,
<li>Council Directive 89/398/EEC relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses,
<li>Council Directive 90/496/EEC on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs, and
<li>Commission Directive 94/54/EC concerning the compulsory indication on the labeling of certain foodstuffs of particulars other that those provided for in Council Directive 79/112/EEC
</ul>
<p>
Since the new Regulations also contain reserved descriptions for some cheeses and creams which had been contained in the Cheese and Cream Regulations 1995, the latter are repealed from the 1 July 1996.
<p>
The Ministry has also issued some additional information as "Food Labelling Regulations 1996: Guidance Notes".
