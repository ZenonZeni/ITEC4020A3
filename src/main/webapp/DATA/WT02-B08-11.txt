<H3>RFA CHALLENGES CONSUMER REPORTS ON IRRESPONSIBLE 
"FUELS ANALYSIS"</H3>
</center>
<BR><BR>

Washington, D.C. -- Responding to the "fuels analysis" of new gasolines contained in Consumer Reports November issue, Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), criticized Consumer Reports for its unscientific and narrow review of new, clean gasolines.  "It is patently irresponsible for Consumer Reports to make any claims on today's cleaner burning fuels on such a limited analysis, which is based on a single test of five fuels in a single vehicle," said Vaughn.<BR><BR>

The Consumer Reports study tested regular and premium 1996 grades of California Phase 2 reformulated gasoline (RFG), federal Phase I RFG blended with MTBE and ethanol, and oxygenated fuel blended with ethanol in an attempt to assess the environmental and performance benefits of new, cleaner gasolines.  The report concludes that the new fuels provide equivalent acceleration and fuel economy to conventional gasoline, but maintains that the new fuels do not provide promised emissions reductions, and challenges whether the new fuels are worth the cost to consumers. <BR><BR>

In its "fuels analysis," Consumer Reports failed to look at the following:<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI>Consumer Reports failed to properly determine the fuel specifications of the tested gasolines.  As a result, we do not know the oxygen content, the aromatic content, sulfur level, or olefin content, all of which can have an impact on emissions.<BR><BR>

<LI>Consumer Reports failed to include evaporative emissions in its emissions tests.  The federal RFG program is intended to reduce both exhaust emissions and evaporative emissions, which occur during refueling and engine cool-down.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) expects to find a greater mass reduction in volatile organic compounds from evaporative emissions rather than from exhaust. <BR><BR>

<LI>Consumer Reports acknowledged that new fuels are intended to reduce toxic emissions, but did not include an analysis of toxic emissions reductions in its review.  Consumer Reports did not compare the fuels for toxics, such as benzene, a known carcinogen.  <BR><BR>
 </UL> 
Finally, Vaughn challenged why Consumer Reports did not study the comprehensive database on emissions from these fuels that was developed by the EPA, the Auto/Oil Research Program, the California Air Resources Board, and numerous other state and industry sources.  "Before making allegations concerning the environmental benefits of today's cleaner fuels, Consumer Reports should have reviewed the plethora of emissions test data that is available on these fuels.  The overwhelming consensus of these tests is that RFG and oxygenated fuels provide significant air quality benefits at a cost-competitive price," concluded Vaughn.
