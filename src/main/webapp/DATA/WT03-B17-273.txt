<PRE><P>
The imported fire ant IFA (Solenopsis invicta<!--Solenopsis invicta-->)
is believed to have come into  the  USA  sometime around 1930
in a port of Mobile,  Alabama.  This species  of ant is very different
then it's American cousin. IFAs are  much more  aggressive with
the ability to sting many times with a  toxic  venom. These  little
guys will not take a no for an answer and will attack you  if
you  are in their way or if you have stepped on their mounds.
The IFA  also build  bigger, more powerful colonies, with an extensive
underground  system  of tunnels  that can reach 50-100 feet in
any direction from their main  mounds, which  have  been  known
to be as tall as three feet!  These  guys   though natives  to
 Argentina, hadclaimed 27 millions acres  by  1957,  and  230
million acres since 1985. In 1995 have begun to move into California
and Arizona. They have attacked and taken over territories normally
claimed  by their American counter parts.
<P>
When  they  first arrived they were given help in the form of
 the  US governments  efforts to eradicate them. The government
funded  wide  spread spraying  of pesticides heptachlor and mirex
during the 1950's and  1960's. Well  guess what, while the sprayings
killed off millions of the  ants,  it also  killed off any competition
allowing the remaining IFAs to  expand  at will. The sprayings
were stopped but not until it was to late and IFAs were here
to stay. They then quickly spread into eight southern states,
into Oregon, and Washington, then recently into Arizona and now
into California.
<P>
Millions  of  people  are stung every year by IFAs  making  them
 very dangerous  to  those people that are allergic to their bite.
 At  least  50 people  die  each year due to allergic reactions
to IFAs bite. Many  can  be prevented with immunotherapy with
whole-body extracts of the IFAs. Since up to 60% of any urban
population is bitten by IFAs, this precaution is a very important
 step to take. If you are one of these folks who are allergic
 to IFAs bite then see your doctor. IFAs  have  been  known to
attack people in their homes,  gardens  and almost any place where
humans and ants meet. This is a very different  case then living
together with harmless ants. To make matters worse (if they can
get  worse),  these  ants no longer fight amongst themselves
for  food  or territories, instead they have gone from a single
 queen per colony ( which fought  other  colonies) to multiple
queen colonies  which  have  lost  the ability  to distinguish
between themselves and the ants of other  colonies, so they live
together and share in the food gathering, etc..
<P>
Where a single queen  colony would contain 200,000 ants per colony,
with about 50 colonies per  acre (in urban areas, as much as 20
colonies would have fought over  a single  1/4 acre lot!), a multiple
queen colony would have as many  as  400 multiple  queens  colonies
 per acre ( or as many  as  100  multiple  queen colonies per
1/4 lot!) will be living together in peaceful existence!  With
this  type of multiple queen set up, IFAs can with stand greater
 cold  and are  able  to come back faster from pesticide attacks
by humans, with  very few animals or other creatures being able
to withstand their onslaught.
<P>
Another problem is that the red imported fire ant (IFA) and the
black imported  fire  ant  (Solenopsis richteri<!--Solenopsis richteri-->)
 are  interbreeding  creating  a stronger  hybrid which is even
more tolerant of pesticide attacks and  more resistant  to cold
(they can live farther north then before).  One  of  the fire
 ants  natural  enemy,  is  the South  American  Phorid  Fly,
is  being considered  as a possible control alternative but if
lessons  in  the  past have  been  learned. More study is needed
before this fly is imported  into the USA.    The  methods described
will work against the IFAs just as  well as against any other
types of ants. Boric acid will kill them just as  surely as it
will kill off other ants. Just remember that the  strength of
the boric acid<!--boric acid--> must be strong enough to kill
them but not so strong that the ants cannot take this mixture
back to their colonies and eventually  to their queens.
