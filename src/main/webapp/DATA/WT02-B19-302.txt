Dear Ms. Pearce: <P>
Thank you for your inquiry on the Individual Education Program (IEP) in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  The reauthorization of IDEA is an opportunity to increase our commitment to provide quality educational services to children with disabilities by well-trained professionals.  We hope that by the end of the reauthorization children, parents, teachers and others will agree that we have legislation that further meets the twin goals of providing a free, appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment for all children with special needs.<P>
As you are well aware, the IEP is a critical component in providing children with disabilities with individually tailored educational services.  It is an important document for various reasons: it embodies the school's commitment to educating a child with a disability consistent with his or her needs, it symbolizes the partnership between the parents and schools, the IEP assists teachers in measuring the progress of the child throughout the year, and it acts as a written agreement among parents, teachers and others on the best course of action in the education of a particular child. The IEP is meant to be developed with the parents of the child and to promote dialog between the school and family.   <P>
CEC fully supports the revolutionary concept and goals of the IEP and worked vigorously for inclusion of the IEP in P.L. 94-142.  As written in statute however, there have been unexpected consequences to the IEP.  Special education teachers have noted the increasing amount of time they are having to devote to "paperwork", time taken from teaching and preparation.  Furthermore, with more inclusive placements, special education teachers report they need additional time to jointly plan, consult and collaborate with regular education teachers.   CEC has urged Congress to eliminate the "short-term objectives" currently required in the IEP that were causing unnecessary documentation of lesson planning.   We are pleased that S. 1075 and the House draft bill would eliminate this requirement.  We have been very concerned, however, that both the Administration's bill and the House draft bill would expand existing requirements in the content of the IEP and add new components.  Both bills would also add factors that should be considered in the development of the IEP.  <P>
CEC is also very concerned with language in S. 1075 that would require justifications for any other placement other than the regular classroom.  There is also added IEP requirements throughout S. 1075 and the House draft that suggest that only the general education curriculum can challenge students to meet high standards.  While CEC wholeheartedly supports the regular classroom and the general education curriculum for the many children with disabilities for whom it is appropriate, there are also children with disabilities who benefit from other settings and life skills curriculums.  Indeed, there is already strong language in IDEA that requires the education of a child with a disability to occur with his or her nondisabled peers unless the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.<P>
We urge the Senate to respect the continuum of placements of children with special needs in the least restrictive environment in which they can receive an appropriate education.  The additional requirements in S. 1075 and the House draft unnecessarily require justifications and explanations for other types of placements and curriculums and should be eliminated.  While the goals of the additional language supports the need for greater inclusion, the additional burden of this documentation will result in less time for the critical collaboration, consultation, and
planning between special education and regular education teachers that research shows makes inclusive placements work.        <P>
We urge the Senate to return to the content required currently in an IEP with three main changes:<P>
1)<B>Eliminate the Requirement for Short Term Objectives</B>.  CEC believes that by eliminating this requirement there will be a significant increase in the time educators have to teach by reducing labor
intensive paperwork.  The IEP should focus on the annual goals (written in measurable terms) and a clear articulation on what the special education and related services will be to achieve those goals.<P>
2)<B>Specify the Extent of Student Participation in National and State-wide Assessments.</B>       Many children with disabilities have been uniformly excluded from participating in the various national and state-wide<BR>
<DL><DD>assessments administered to their non-disabled classmates.  As a result of these exclusions, assessment result are skewed and children with disabilities are not held to the same high standards and expectations as their peers.  Thus, CEC believes the past exclusion from assessments, warrants a new IEP component that would require a statement describing the extent of student participation in national and state-wide assessments and the accommodations and/or modifications needed for such participation.</DL><BR>
3)<B>The Age in Which Transition Planning Should Begin Should be Changed from 16 to 14.  </B>Currently, a transition plan must be developed by the IEP team by the time a student is 16, or when determined appropriate for the individual, beginning at age 14 or younger.  The majority of IEP teams, however, do not approach the subject of a student's transition from school into his or her adult life until the team is required to at age 16.  Unfortunately, many students with disabilities drop out of school before they reach 16 and do not have transition plans.  Lowering the age for mandated transition planning will increase our ability to keep students with disabilities in school by providing students with an opportunity to understand that they are learning skills that will lead to a job, to further education and to living independently. <P>
We believe that other factors including the transfer of rights at the age of majority, braille literacy, and behavior management plans may be factors that need to be considered in the development of the IEP but not required to be apart of every child's IEP.  We also believe that in developing any IEP the IEP team should consider the child's strengths, parental concerns and the results of the initial evaluation or most recent reevaluation.  <P>
Thank you again for providing CEC with an opportunity to express our support for the IEP process and our recommended changes.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further assistance.<P>
<BR>
Sincerely,<P>
<BR>

          <BR>

<DL><DD>(C)a statement of the specific educational services to be provided to such child, and the extent to which such child will be able to participate in regular educational programs,<P>
<DD><I>(D)a statement describing the extent of student participation in national and state-wide assessments and the accommodations and/or modifications needed for such participation,</DL> <BR>
     (E)</I>a statement of the needed transition services for students beginning no later than age <STRIKE>16 </STRIKE><I>14 </I>and annually thereafter <STRIKE>(and, when determined appropriated for the individual, beginning at age 14 or younger)</STRIKE>, including, when appropriate, a statement of the interagency responsibilities or linkages (or both) before the student leaves the school setting,<P>

<I><DL><DD>(G)</I> appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and schedules for determining, on at least an annual basis, whether instructional objectives are being achieved.  </DL><BR>
In the case where a participating agency, other than the educational agency, fails to provide agreed upon services, the educational agency shall reconvene the IEP team to identify alternative strategies to meet the transition objectives.     <BR>
