U.S. APPEALS COURT AFFIRMS RULING THAT INDIANA COAL LAW IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has affirmed a lower court ruling
that struck down portions of an Indiana law that encourages the state's
electric utilities to find ways to burn high-sulfur coal and still comply
with the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.
   In a Dec. 22 ruling (Case No. 95-2065), the appeals court said parts of
the 1991 law, passed in response to the Clean Air Act and strongly
supported by an Indiana high-sulfur coal industry that feared an influx of
low-sulfur Western coal, violate the Interstate Commerce Clause of the
Constitution and therefore are unconstitutional.
   Under the Indiana Environmental Compliance Plan Act (ECPA), the state
Utility Regulatory Commission can pre-approve a utility's Clean Air Act
compliance plan, but only if several criteria are met. One of the key
provisions is whether the utility will continue or increase its use of
Indiana high-sulfur coal.
   In challenging the legality of the law, the Alliance for Clean Coal
(ACC), a coalition of Western coal producers and railroads, has argued that
such a provision amounts to illegal protectionism and violates the
Constitution.
   Last March, U.S. District Judge John Tinder found that portions of the
Indiana law violate the Interstate Commerce Clause and should be
invalidated (UER, 14 April '95, 3).
   The appeals court concurred, saying a utility compliance plan that has a
negative impact on Indiana coal is ``subject to continuing annual
surveillance'' by the URC under the Indiana law.
   As a result, those portions of the ECPA ``discriminate against
interstate commerce based solely upon geographic origin...the clear intent
of the statute is to benefit Indiana coal at the expense of Western coal,''
the appeals court said.
   The fact that the Indiana law ``merely encourages'' utilities to use
high-sulfur coal does not make it ``any less discriminatory,'' the appeals
court said. The result, the court added, is ``discriminatory state action
that is forbidden by the Commerce Clause.''
   Concluded the court: ``Despite the fact that low-sulfur Western coal may
be a more efficient compliance option, the ECPA clearly attempts to prevent
Indiana electrical utilities from switching to low-sulfur coal. This
amounts to discriminatory state action that is forbidden by the Commerce
Clause. The defendants have not discharged their burden of demonstrating
that the statute serves a legitimate and compelling interest unrelated to
economic protectionism.''
   A spokesman for the Indiana Coal Council, a major supporter of the
Indiana law, said he was not surprised by the ruling. Indiana is not
expected to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Terry O'Connor, vice president of government relations for ARCO Coal, an
ACC member, said the group expects to win a similar lawsuit it filed late
last year in Ohio (UER, 29 Sept '95, 1).
   Asked what the ACC hopes to gain by the Indiana victory, O'Connor said
the rewards would not be immediate. ``We recognize that utilities in the
various Midwestern states have already made their Phase-One [compliance]
decisions'' under the acid rain rules, he said.
   However, ``to the extent that those decisions may have been skewed by
the Indiana protectionist law, we're hopeful that those utilities will now
feel free to revisit those fuel decisions and look westward to inexpensive,
low-sulfur coal.''
   In the long run, the ACC hopes to pick up additional business when
Midwest utilities finalize Phase-Two compliance plans. ``With this decision
now hopefully behind us, we are optimistic that as Illinois, Indiana and
Ohio utilities prepare Phase-Two compliance plans for submission [to
regulatory agencies] in the next year or so, they will look favorably on
Western coal as a viable option,'' O'Connor said.
   A spokeswoman for PSI Energy, which is building a Phase-One scrubber at
its 3,149-MW Gibson plant near Princeton, Ind., doubted the appeals court
ruling would have much impact on her company.
   ``Since we didn't rely on the [ECPA] for Phase One, the ruling probably
won't have a great effect on PSI for Phase-Two plans,'' she said. ``But it
might eliminate some steps in the future that we might have had to go
through.''

CALIF. PUC TO STUDY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF RESTRUCTURING ORDER

   The California Public Utilities Commission has decided to conduct an
environmental impact report to assess potential environmental damage from
the move to a competitive electric power industry.
   In issuing its final electric restructuring order last month, the PUC
agreed to conduct an EIR under the California Environmental Quality Act.
``The magnitude of our proposed electric policy favors reviewing the
possible environmental impacts of a new industry structure,'' the PUC
stated.
   The PUC responded to a motion filed by the Natural Resources Defense
Council in June 1994 for determining whether CEQA applied to the
commission's electric restructuring proceeding. The PUC noted that parties
disagreed whether electric restructuring fit within the CEQA definition of
a project and thus triggered the CEQA requirements for an EIR.
   While the California Supreme Court has interpreted CEQA's definition of
a project as not requiring a finding of a direct physical effect on the
environment, the courts have not clarified whether policy actions without
direct environmental effects are CEQA projects. ``We cannot make a finding
at this time about whether electric restructuring constitutes a CEQA
project,'' the PUC conceded. ``However, we can anticipate that there is no
harm, and abundant good, in moving forth with analysis under CEQA at this
time.'' The commission cautioned that delaying the preparation of an EIR
could severely hamper restructuring efforts, which it deemed vital to the
state's economy.
   In its restructuring order, the PUC adopted president Daniel Fessler's
proposal to create simultaneously an independent system operator to control
transmission, a wholesale power exchange and direct access phased-in over
five years beginning Jan. 1, 1998.
   The PUC established a five-year transition period to a competitive
industry, with a non-bypassable competitive transition charge, or CTC, on
all retail customers to ensure utilities full recovery of their stranded
investments by 2005.
   The PUC determined that preparation of an EIR rather than a negative
declaration was necessary because electric restructuring may potentially
impact the environment in several ways. The PUC cited NRDC's concern that
electric restructuring may reduce energy efficiency incentives and restore
the linkage between utilities' profits and sales volumes, which have been
decoupled by the Electric Revenue Adjustment Mechanism.
   The PUC also cited Pacific Gas and Electric's observation that electric
restructuring may result in shifts in energy production, resulting in a
different mix of energy resources with a potential for creating
environmental impacts.
   The PUC directed its commission advisory compliance division within 100
days to issue a notice of preparation of an EIR and retain the services of
an environmental consultant to be approved by the commission. The
consultant will work with the commission to prepare an EIR that will
analyze the environmental impacts of electric restructuring, compare
environmental effects of alternative policies and identify mitigation
measures for potential significant impacts.
   Given the broad restructuring policy, the EIR will contain a more
general discussion of impacts, alternatives and migitations than a
traditional site-specific environmental assessment, the PUC noted. Hence,
it will attempt to anticipate future scenarios that may develop under the
commission's restructuring policy.
   Moreover, the EIR may incorporate or refer to the environmental impact
statement the the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is preparing under
the National Environmental Policy Act for its mega-notice of proposed
rulemaking on open access, the PUC said.
   The PUC also committed itself to maintaining the state's resource
diversity and developing policies that promote development of new renewable
energy resources in a restructured electric services industry. ``We
continue to believe that a minimum renewables purchase requirement is the
best approach to meet our resource diversity goals,'' the PUC said.
   However, the commission acknowledged that it had not determined whether
the renewables requirement should be imposed on retail suppliers or
generators. Accordingly, the PUC delayed consideration of this question
until its implementation phase and called upon its working group to provide
further guidance.
   The PUC stated its preference for setting the renewables purchase
requirement at the same level for all electric utilities statewide, but it
acknowledged that a transitional strategy may be appropriate given the
utilities' current resource portfolios.
   To provide flexibility in meeting the renewables requirement, renewables
``credits'' would be tradable similar to pollution credits under the
federal Clean Air Act Amendments and the South Coast Air Quality Management
District's Regional Clean Air Incentives Market.
   The PUC set a target date of January 1998 for establishing minimum
renewables levels continuing through 2000, at which time the commission
would review the requirement for possible modification. As with the Clean
Air Act and state air quality permit programs, the PUC plans to establish a
``meaningful penalty'' for noncompliance.
   This market-based approach would eliminate the need for a surcharge to
fund renewables development by allowing buyers and sellers to secure the
best bargains on renewables and include the costs in their prices, the PUC
said.
   By contrast, establishing a surcharge to fund renewables development
would require the PUC to administer and disperse the funds to ensure
compliance. However, after its disastrous experience with the ill-fated
Biennial Resource Planning Update independent power auction, the commission
stressed that it was extremely reluctant to do so.
   ``The minimum renewables requirement approach will allow the market to
provide the most cost-effective renewable resources, without our
intervention,'' the PUC predicted. Moreover, allowing providers to trade
renewables requirements could serve to minimize stranded costs from
qualifying facility contracts by providing new markets for QFs' power, the
PUC said.
   This approach would also likely stimulate research and development of
renewables as existing renewables are replaced by new resources to meet the
increased demand for electricity, the commission predicted.
   The PUC's renewables standard is being welcomed by officials at the
American Wind Energy Association, who with the Union of Concerned
Scientists and others, helped sell the PUC on the idea.
   ``There had been an expectation of a tax on generation, with the
revenues used to support the renewables industry,'' AWEA executive director
Randall Swisher said. ``That is one way to go, but from our perspective a
standard is less bureaucratic and more market oriented.''
   Swisher said the minimum renewable capacity requirement should be placed
on sellers, not generators, so that the state--not FERC--would have
oversight authority. The standard should be set at around 11.5% of total
capacity, the current share of the California market provided by
renewables, Swisher said.
   Sellers with no renewable capacity could purchase credits from another
company that owned renewables capacity or that had excess renewable energy
credits, he said.
   With a portfolio standard, ``you just set the minimum standard and sit
back and let the market do the rest,'' Swisher said.

EPRI ANALYSIS SAYS ELECTRICAL WORKERS HAVE 10-20% MORE RISK OF BRAIN
CANCER

   A new Electric Power Research Institute study that assessed research on
workplace electromagnetic fields has found that electrical workers are
about 10% to 20% more likely to develop brain cancer than other workers.
   But because no clear relationship can be found between the amount of
exposure to EMFs and the level of risk, researchers cannot conclude that
EMFs cause brain cancer, the analysis said. The study found that ``the
apparent lack of a clear pattern of exposure and risk substantially
detracts from the hypothesis that measured magnetic fields in the work
environment are responsible for the observed excess of risk.''
   In other words, according to coauthor Dr. Patricia Buffler, who is dean
of the University of California at Berkeley, School of Public Health,
``there is something about employment in [the studied] occupations'' that
may or may not have anything to do with EMFs. She argued that the observed
association between work in electrical occupations, a broad category that
includes electricians and power plant operators, and elevated cancer risk
likely has more to do with limitations in the studies than any kind of tie
to EMF exposure.
   The study, published in the December issue of the Journal of
Occupational and Environmental Medicine, reexamined more than 50 previous
studies and pools the results of 29 of them for a new statistical analysis.
The pooled data showed a slightly elevated risk of brain tumors (10-20%)
for workers in the electrical occupations category, a result with
sufficient statistical strength to be considered reliable. Higher risks
were seen for some more specific job categories and for one subtype of
brain cancer, gliomas.
   The authors, who in addition to Buffler included Dr. Leeka Kheifets of
EPRI, and Dr. Abdelmonem Afifi and Zhong Zhang of the University of
California at Los Angeles, School of Public Health, assessed their findings
against three possible hypotheses on EMFs and cancer.
   First, they concluded that the analysis ``provides some evidence against
the hypothesis of no association between occupational exposure to EMF and
the risk of cancer.'' On the second possibility--a small but pervasive
cancer risk--they found ``some evidence to support the hypothesis.''
The third possibility is that ``the true EMF effect is large'' but only
impacts individuals who are in some way predisposed to develop cancer or
who are exposed simultaneously to another factor. On this count, the
researchers concede that their study ``provides no clues that could help to
identify a circumstance or condition'' to explain such a risk.
   Overall, the researchers found ``it is not possible to conclude that EMF
is causally associated with the observed excess of brain cancer in workers
employed in electrical occupations.''
   About one-third of the studies reviewed in the EPRI report were
conducted in the United States, another one-third in Scandinavia and the
remainder in Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Germany and other countries.
The earliest study was published in 1983, while the largest number of
studies, six, appeared in 1991.
   About half of the studies included follow-up before 1984 and were
published before 1990. Study designs used by the investigators included
proportional mortality, case control analysis of death certificate data,
case control and cohort studies.
   The U.S. and other studies showed relative risk increases of 40% or
higher compared to those with no occupational exposures to EMFs. The
Scandinavian studies, almost all of which were cohort studies based on
incident risk, showed the lowest relative risks for brain cancer. The
reasons for the lower relative risk reported in the Scandinavian studies
``are not exactly clear,'' the EPRI study said.
   A 1994 study of Canadian and French electric utility workers showed a
doubling of brain tumor risk by some measures, for example, but the result
was not statistically significant (UER, 1 April '94, 1).
   A large study of U.S. utility workers, funded by EPRI and completed
early last year, found a statistically significant increase in brain cancer
risk for those with the highest exposures (UER, 20 Jan '95, 1).

CALIFORNIA RETREATS, BUT MASS. GOV. WELD HOLDS FIRM, ON EV MANDATES

   Massachusetts Gov. William Weld (R) reaffirmed his commitment to the
state's zero-emission vehicle program, which includes a 2% electric vehicle
sales mandate beginning in 1998, despite recent action by the California
Air Resources Board to drop its own EV sales mandate that would have begun
in the same year.
   Bowing to pressure from the auto industry, CARB Dec. 21 said it will
lift the state's landmark mandate requiring auto makers to sell about
22,000 EVs in California beginning in 1998. CARB directed its staff to
finalize a plan by March 1996 to lift the mandate requiring that 2% of
vehicles sold in California have zero emissions by 1998 and 5% by 2001.
   The air board decided not to impose the mandate until 2003, at which
time 10% of vehicles sold in California will have to be exhaust-free in
order to achieve a statewide reduction of 14 tons/day of nitrous oxide and
hydrocarbons.
   In the interim, auto makers must aim to sell up to 3,700 EVs in the
smog-laden Los Angeles and Sacramento basins during the first three years
of the program--750 in 1998, 1,500 in 1999 and 1,500 in 2000. Based on auto
makers' reports, CARB estimated a statewide annual production of 5,000 EVs
in 1996 and 1997 and 14,000 in 1998.
   Massachusetts' EV plan is modeled closely on the California plan, and
that state has also faced tremendous pressure from automakers to drop its
minimum EV sales requirement.
   But Weld said Dec. 22 he thought CARB made the wrong decision to weaken
its program and noted ``that decision does not bind Massachusetts.''
Edison Electric Institute director of electric transportation Rick Tempchin
called the CARB decision ``a significant mistake,'' adding that EV
technology, consumer readiness and infrastructure are on track to launch EV
sales in California in 1998.
   ``What is missing is the political will to stand up to automakers, oil
companies and others who insist that token EV rollouts will ensure the
success of this technology,'' Tempchin said.
   CARB officials stressed that under the new plan, car makers must still
meet air pollution reduction goals through production of cleaner cars with
reduced exhaust, evaporative and refueling emissions.
   The air board adopted the zero-emission vehicle rule in 1990 to reduce
air pollution from passenger cars and light trucks. The mandate currently
applies to the seven largest auto manufacturers, with sales of more than
35,000 vehicles a year in California. By 2003, all auto makers that sell
more than 3,000 vehicles a year in the state will have to comply with the
mandate.
   The air board plans to hold a public hearing and vote on the revised
plan in March. However, CARB chairman John Dunlap said the air board had
reached consensus on lifting the mandate.
   CARB directed its staff in November to devise an alternative proposal
after the Battery Technology Assessment Panel reported auto makers'
conclusions that existing lead acid battery-powered EVs would have too
limited a sales demand to meet state pollution reduction goals (UER, 24 Nov
'95, 1).
   The air board received more than 200 comments to three staff proposals:
1) a market-based approach; 2) changing the zero-emission vehicle mandate
for early years but maintaining the rules intact for later years; and 3)
keeping the same basic format but reducing the 2% mandate for 1998.
   CARB agreed with auto makers that advanced lithium and nickel-based
battery technology for EVs--currently the only zero-emission vehicle--will
not be commercially viable until 2001. The auto industry contends that
existing lead-acid batteries have limited range and are too costly, making
them unattractive to consumers.
   Forcing manufacturers to introduce unaffordable vehicles that are
technologically unreliable would poison the fledgling EV market, CARB said.
``If you see them sitting in storerooms and no one buys them it sends a
negative message,'' said a CARB spokesman. ``No one wants to poison the
market.''
   In the interim, automakers will be allowed to build only the number of
zero-emission vehicles they think they can sell, which manufacturers
estimate at 2,000 to 3,000 in 1996 and 1997 and 14,000 a year after that,
Martin said. The 2% mandate would have amounted to about 22,000 EVs.
   Auto makers will be required to sign a memorandum of agreement
committing to a ``Cal/Big 7 Technology Development Partnership,'' to
continue research and development of advanced batteries and EVs.
Manufacturers would be given a market incentive for early production of
exhaust-free and longer-range vehicles through 2003. The state of
California would purchase some EVs each year.
   The revised mandate will not relieve auto makers from meeting their air
pollution reduction requirements based on their percentage of total vehicle
sales in California. However, CARB gave each vehicle manufacturer
flexibility to design their own individual plan for meeting their emission
reduction requirements.
   CARB directed its staff to prepare a proposal by March for meeting
statewide pollution reduction goals in lieu of the zero-emission vehicle
mandate. ``There will be absolutely no loss of pollution reduction,''
Martin stressed. ``They will individually be held accountable for them.''

THE CLOSE OF 1995 SIGNALS BEARISH SENTIMENT IN MARKET IS CONTINUING

   The sulfur dioxide emission allowance market ended the year with its
steepest monthly decline of the year, as prices nosedived in December,
oddly enough, due to the presence of a buyer.
   Bidding in a request for proposal from Illinois Power seeking 15,000
1995 allowances for immediate delivery was ``very aggressive,'' said Lynda
Clemmons of Enron Capital and Trade Resources. IP passed up prices that
``would have been leapt on'' three weeks earlier, said Carlton Bartels, a
director at Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage Services. The winning
bidder, which was named Dec. 18, 1995, was thought to have offered prices
in the range of $105-110/ton.
   As a result, the Utility Environment Report SO2 Allowance Market Prices
have dropped to $105-$107/ton for Phase One and $100-102 for Phase Two (see
box, page 3). This is well below end-of-November prices of $119-121 for
Phase One and $118-120 for Phase Two.
   One observer noted that, with more than 3 million allowances out there,
an enormous supply was ``chasing Illinois Power's demand for 15,000.''
   Opinions varied, however, on the relative importance of an RFP the size
of Illinois Power's. One player argued that trades of 15,000 are ``not all
that large'' anymore. Another countered that a straight-out purchase of
that amount for the end of the year is still a ``pretty big deal.''
   There were few factors that could explain the increased market activity
that has been seen in recent weeks. The end of the year was having, at
most, a psychological effect, some said. There was no indication that
utilities had decided that they needed additional allowances for 1995
compliance.
   The most common explanation was that buyers are being motivated by
prices that are now ``just too good to pass up,'' and sellers may be
worrying that prices will continue to fall. One player suggested that
sellers were already anticipating a negative impact on prices from the
EPA's next auction in March.
   Cantor Fitzgerald's market price index for Phase One allowances was
$108.87 at the end of December 1995, down from $116.89 a month earlier.
Similarly, Emissions Exchange of Denver moved its value for 1995 allowances
to $105 and for 2000 allowance to $100, also a sharp drop from November
1995.
   Attention now is focused on how much lower prices will go. The market is
``pretty close to the bottom,'' Bartels argues. ``We are getting more
feedback from people who are saying that this is ridiculous, that they're
not going to sell at that price.''
   While some pessimistic studies in the past have shown that allowances
were worth less than they were trading for, Bartels noted that no reliable
study has put their value below current prices.
   Others see no evidence of the slide ending, however. ``Every seller who
has waited has done worse,'' said one player who declined to be named. The
$100 mark is a weak psychological barrier that ``is not going to stop the
downward trend,'' he said, and the barrier will likely be breached whenever
the next significant buyer comes along.
   ``It is not clear what would provide support to the market at this
point,'' said Bill Babcock, a consultant with Putnam, Hayes & Bartlett in
Cambridge, Mass. The marginal cost of producing these allowances is near
zero, he said, and demand for allowances for near-term use is almost
nonexistent.
   The partial government shutdown, meanwhile, was drawing complaints from
traders. With the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency essentially closed,
allowance transactions were not being processed. Contracts can still be
signed, one trader noted, but deals cannot be completed. The greater
uncertainty will come if the impasse drags on closer to the true-up
deadline at the end of January.

KEY TEXAS REP. SIDES WITH GAS INDUSTRY, CALLS FOR FUEL-NEUTRAL NSPS FOR
NOX

   Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) lined up on the side of natural gas in that
industry's escalating battle with the coal industry over a proposal by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to establish a fuel-neutral new source
performance standard (NSPS) for nitrogen oxide emissions.
   EPA is pondering a 0.15 lb./million Btu standard for NOx, a standard
that gas-fired power plants could achieve with relative ease but that many
coal-fired units would be hard-pressed to meet.
   The coal industry has argued for a standard based on fuel types, which
the industry said would allow coal to be competitive with gas.
   But in a Dec. 21, 1995 letter to his congressional colleagues, Barton
called EPA's proposed standard ``welcome news and sound and equitable
approach'' to preventing additional NOx pollution from new sources.
   ``Single standards would treat all fuels and technologies equally,''
said Barton, who chairs the House Commerce Committee's oversight and
investigations subcommittee. ``It will focus future industrial and utility
output in an efficient and competitive manner while minimizing the impact
on our nation's environment..''
   Last year, Barton hosted a number of hearings on Clean Air Act issues
and is heading a group of House Republicans expected to introduce
amendments to the air statute sometime this spring.
   Barton said a fuel-neutral standard ``will enable all combinations of
fuel (coal, oil, and natural gas) and technologies to effectively compete
for new markets. Although reliable technology exists today, this
competition will spur the development of more efficient domestic
technologies that will allow operators to meet this standard even more cost
effectively in the future.''
Barton stressed that EPA should make the new standard apply only to future
plants and not to existing facilities.
   ``While we support the fuel-neutral standard, we strongly urge the
agency to apply the standard prospectively only,'' he said. ``This `new'
standard should not apply to existing equipment. The shift to competitive
fuel-neutral standards should not penalize anyone, only invigorate
competition among suppliers for new boiler markets.''
   If a full fledged battle breaks out over the issue, Barton will find
himself pitted against coal industry allies in the Wyoming and West
Virginia delegations, to name a few, who will try to pressure EPA to base
the new NSPS standard for NOx on fuel types.
   Barton urged EPA to consider only relevant information, and not
politics, in determining the form of the new standard.
   ``[W]e encourage the agency to determine an appropriate numerical
standard based on a thorough consideration of all available and relevant
information,'' Barton said. ``The Clean Air Act amendments define the
agency's responsibility on this matter, and we trust the agency to
promulgate a standard that meets those requirements.''
   The new standard, required under a court-ordered schedule, is not
expected to be issued in draft form before September. A final rule is due
by November 1997.

SIERRA CLUB SEEKS INJUNCTION TO ORDER PS COLORADO TO CUT HAYDEN EMISSIONS

   The Sierra Club has petitioned the U.S. District Court at Denver to move
more expeditiously in assessing penalties against three utilities for
alleged air pollution standards violations at the 446-MW Hayden Generating
Station in northwest Colorado (UER, 18 Aug '95, 4).
   The group asked the court, pending determination of a final ruling, to
issue an injunction against the companies to stop ``excessive and illegal''
emissions at the plant operated by Public Service of Colorado. PacifiCorp
and Salt River Project also own interests in the Hayden facility.
   Judge Lewis Babcock found last August, in response to a Sierra Club
complaint, that the plant had exceeded Clean Air Act emission standards
more than 19,000 times in the past five years. The utilities are liable for
a total of $493-million in fines. However, the court asked the parties to
negotiate a settlement to correct the excessive emissions.
   In its latest filing in the case (No. CV-93-1749), the Sierra Club said
negotiations with PS Colorado have broken down, and it requested the court
to issue an injunction within 60 days ordering the company to take
corrective action at once.

B&W ACQUIRES JOY ENVIRONMENTAL TO BOOST POLLUTION CONTROL WORK

   Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation has acquired the assets of Joy
Environmental Technologies (JET) from its parent company, Harnischfeger
Industries, for an undisclosed amount. B&W, based in Barberton, Ohio,
expects the acquisition to expand its pollution control work in the power
industry.
   JET, with offices in Houston and Malvern, Pa., specializes in
environmental technologies used in the utility industry. Product lines that
B&W Power Generation will acquire from JET include acid mist precipitators,
electrostatic precipitators, dry flue-gas desulfurization systems and
baghouses. In addition, Diamond Power Specialty, another B&W subsidiary in
Lancaster, Ohio, will obtain JET's ash handling system business.
   B&W, which is a unit of McDermott International, already markets
environmental controls, along with steam generation equipment and
engineering/construction services. The company also has a 50% stake in four
independent power projects that produce 160 MW and is building projects in
China and Pakistan.

CALIF. AIR DISTRICTS APPROVE PG&E NOX PLANS FOR DROPPING SCR REQUIREMENTS

   Pacific Gas and Electric expects to save $150-million after negotiating
new rules with three California air quality districts that provide low
cost, short-term solutions for reducing nitrogen oxide emissions at six
power plants.
   The company said by combining its NOx retrofit program with PG&E's
regular maintenance outages, the final NOx rules provide a ``more workable
compliance schedule through 2004.''
   At issue, PG&E said, were local and state rules that ``effectively
mandated the use of costly selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology
to achieve NOx emissions of 10 parts per million. By using front-end,
low-NOx combustion systems (LNCs) the company can reduce emissions,
previously ranging from 150 ppm to 300 ppm, to as low as 20 ppm to 30 ppm,
while future improvements in technology could lower the figure even
more.''
   The new rules apply to the Morro Bay plant in the San Luis Obispo Air
Pollution Control District; the Moss Landing plant in the Monterey Bay
Unified Air Pollution District; and the Contra Costa, Hunters Point,
Pittsburg and Potrero plants in the Bay Area Air Quality Management
District.
   Bev Alexander, an environmental attorney who serves as NOx strategy
project manager for PG&E, said, ``This was a win-win situation because PG&E
was able to propose additional amendments that would use pollution
prevention technology to achieve strict air-quality standards with greater
business flexibility and at a lower cost.''
   PG&E's NOx team began working in 1994 with state regulators on rules
originally scheduled to require significant NOx reductions by 1997. They
would have forced the company to either retrofit or retire most of its
fossil-fueled units by that year.
   SCR is a back-end method that cleans up NOx after it has formed, using a
chemical reaction involving ammonia. Use of the system requires
transporting ammonia to power plants, storing it on-site and emitting some
into the atmosphere. The system also requires construction of costly
facilities to house the heavy equipment involved.
   LNC is a front-end pollution control that reduces NOx formation by
precise flame control within the boiler. Ammonia is not required. The
company said for one of PG&E's generating units in the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District, the cost of retrofitting the boiler would be
$5-million to $12-million for LNC compared with $20-million for SCR.
   The amendments adopted by the three air districts cover all of PG&E's
power plants except the Humboldt Bay plant, which is in a district that
already meets air quality standards.
   The successful installation of LNC at the Morro Bay plant was a major
reason why the local air districts approved of PG&E's proposal. Emission
figures from the Morro Bay facility influenced the district boards in their
favorable decisions, the company said.

PA. UTILITIES APPLAUD DEP MOVE TO MAKE STATE'S RULES NO STRICTER THAN
EPA'S

   Electric utilities in Pennsylvania are enthusiastically backing an
effort by the state Dept. of Environmental Protection (DEP) to streamline
regulations and ensure that they are no more stringent than federal
standards.
   DEP began the ``Regulatory Basics'' initiative in August at the
direction of DEP secretary James Seif, who said he wanted to overhaul
regulations that exceeded federal standards, as well as those that imposed
disproportionate economic costs, lacked clarity or were redundant or no
longer necessary.
   The department asked for comments to be filed toward the end of 1995,
and investor-owned utilities filed jointly through the Pennsylvania
Electric Association (PEA). The initiative is undocketed and no public
hearings are planned, though hearings might be scheduled later, a DEP
spokesman said.
   In its comments, PEA applauded Seif for ``attempting to minimize costs
on the regulated community, encourage performance-based outcomes and to
create a level playing field for Pennsylvania businesses.''
   The utilities complained that DEP has relied on a ``belts and
suspenders'' approach to environmental regulation, or using multiple
assumptions about environmental impacts. ``While this certainly ensures
that the goal of environmental protection is met, the regulated community
has incurred tremendous costs, often with little or no attendant
environmental benefit,'' PEA said. Aside from affecting the utilities, this
approach has helped drive out industrial firms and repelled new investment
in manufacturing.
   Specifically, PEA criticized DEP's water quality-based effluent
limitations as being based on a ``steady state'' model that assumes
worst-case scenarios and is far too restrictive. The group noted that each
condition measured in the model has a low probability of occurrence, while
the combination of conditions would rarely or never occur. PEA prefers
``dynamic'' models, which account for variations of flow, effluent and
environmental conditions, and which determine the actual probability that a
water quality exceedance will occur.
   PEA also complained that DEP applies human health criteria at the point
of discharge, instead of at the point of withdrawal for drinking water
supplies. This exceeds the requirements of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, as well as Pennsylvania's own written regulations, it
pointed out. PEA also contended that DEP applies aquatic life standards
when there are no substantial populations in streams.
   Regarding air pollution issues, PEA said that the state DEP uses a
broader definition of pollutants than EPA for requiring Title 5 permits
under the Clean Air Act. The state also does not follow federal standards
relating to permit revisions and flexibility, and does not allow an
``emergency defense'' for unforeseeable events. The utilities also think
the $37/ton permitting fee may be higher than necessary to fund DEP
programs, and they would eliminate the $14/ton fee for actual emissions
because it violates the federal Clean Air Act.
   The department also forbids the use of emission reduction credits (ERCs)
for compliance with nitrogen oxide ``Reasonably Available Control
Technology'' (RACT) standards, despite EPA efforts to develop emissions
trading, the group said. They also fear that ERCs generated from
over-compliance will not be applicable to future reduction requirements for
NOx.
   While utilities agree heartily with the direction of the Regulatory
Basics proceeding, the Sierra Club condemned the move to roll back DEP
standards to the federal level. Jeff Schmidt, government liaison in the
Harrisburg, Pa. office, told Utility Environment Report, ``The minimum
federal standards are just that--minimums. They are meant to provide a
safety net, but states should be able to design more protective standards
based on specific regional and climactic conditions. Federal standards are
a floor below which you should not go, but the administration seems to want
to make them a ceiling.''
   Schmidt also criticized Seif for developing many of the changes among
his staff, without allowing public access to records. He estimated that the
changes could take 18 months, and ``the cumbersome regulatory process
usually rewards economic interests.''

CALIF. COURT THROWS OUT SUIT CLAIMING SOCAL ED EQUIPMENT EMFS CAUSED
CANCER

   A California Superior Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit against
Southern California Edison brought by three people with cancer who claim
that strong electromagnetic fields from the utility's equipment caused
their diseases.
   In an order last month, Judge Warren Siegel wrote that summary judgment
must be granted in favor of the defendants because the plaintiffs ``cannot
show causation by any generally accepted scientific principle in the
medical community.''
   The only witnesses that the plaintiffs offered to address the question
of what caused the cancers, according to the order, were experts on
statistical studies of EMFs and cancer. The judge found that they were not
qualified to address the medical issue of whether the particular
individuals' cancers were caused by EMFs.
   The judge wrote that the plaintiffs were, therefore, ``relying on
statistical analysis to express a medical opinion that EMF may cause
certain types of cancer.'' This, he ruled, was insufficient to allow the
case to go to trial.
   The plaintiffs intend to file a motion with Siegel requesting a new
trial, according to their attorney, Annee Della Donna of the Wylie A.
Aitken law firm. The decision to dismiss was ``unbelievably erroneous,''
Della Donna said. The judge ruled on the sufficiency of the causation
witnesses, Della Donna argued, when he was supposed to be ruling on the
admissibility of the witnesses under various evidentiary rules governing
scientific testimony.
   If the request for a new trial is rejected, she said, the plaintiffs
will seek a writ from the appeals court. ``This is a clear violation of our
due process rights'' she added, since the judge ruled on something without
giving proper notice that the issue was up for consideration.
   John Tinker, senior counsel with SoCal Ed, countered that ``the judge
has recognized that there is no sound scientific evidence to bring this
before a jury.'' He added, ``The company and the industry are very pleased
with this result.''
   The three plaintiffs with cancer in this case all worked in a real
estate office on the ground floor of a 14-story office building in Orange
County, Calif. The office had unusually strong EMFs because it is directly
above a vault containing transformers, switching gear and distribution
circuits for the building. The building owners and the real estate company
are named as defendants in the case in addition to SoCal Ed (Johsz et al.
vs Koll Company et al., Case No. 726765).
   Two other individuals with cancer who also worked in the office have a
similar lawsuit pending against the same defendants. It is before a
different judge and was not directly affected by the dismissal of this
case.
   Della Donna, who is handling the second case as well, has said that the
excess incidence of disease among workers in the real estate office
constitutes a cancer cluster.

TVA'S FINAL IRP INCREASES COMMITMENT TO RENEWABLES, ENERGY CONSERVATION

   The Tennessee Valley Authority said it has increased its commitment to
renewables and energy conservation in a final version of its integrated
resource plan made public in late December.
   TVA said the changes were made in part as a response to comments from
conservation and environmental groups, which had called on the federally
owned utility to adopt more aggressive policies in these areas.
   Among the short-term actions in the final plan, TVA said it would
intensify research into the use of wind energy and carry out at least one
wind project in its service area during the next two years.
   At the same time, TVA will begin tests this year of co-firing of biomass
waste products at its large coal-fired plants and then in 1997 move ahead
with the first commercial biomass co-firing project.
   In a third effort, TVA will step up reviews of ways to increase use of
coalbed methane and landfill methane to produce power in the region. TVA
hopes to sponsor an initial test of a fuel cell-landfill methane system.
   On energy efficiency programs, TVA said it is now committed to add 650
MW of demand-side resources by 2002 and as much as 2,200 MW by 2010. It
said this was an increase of 750 MW over previous versions of the plan.
   Also as part of the IRP, TVA detailed a longer term research plan for
renewables and conservation that will cover the use of photovoltaics for
service to remote areas and for cutting residential energy costs, electric
vehicle infrastructure development and use of communication techniques for
energy load management.
   Because TVA took an approach in its IRP that uses a portfolio of
options, the plan contained no set estimate of environmental impacts,
especially over the long term. But TVA said the need to comply with federal
and state regulations would create a ``safety net'' effect against
increased environmental impacts as different options were implemented.
   Outside groups will make one final round of comments on the TVA plan in
mid-January, after which it will be approved in final form by the TVA board
in February.
   TVA has moved ahead in the last two months to start up two nuclear
reactors at its Watts Bar and Browns Ferry sites, over strong protests from
the environmental community. It remains to be seen whether improvements in
the IRP will bridge the differences over nuclear policy.

MISSOURI IOUS, STATE UNIVERSITY CREATE ENERGY COLLABORATIVE FOR RENEWABLES

   Missouri's investor-owned utilities and the University of
Missouri-Columbia, College of Engineering have formed the Missouri Electric
Utility Renewables Group (MEURG), an organization dedicated to identifying,
gathering information, researching and testing the feasibility of renewable
generation opportunities in the state.
   Participating utilities include Empire District Electric, Kansas City
Power & Light, St. Joseph Light & Power, Union Electric and UtiliCorp
United.
   The group will give member utilities a forum to discuss integration of
renewable energy into the state's electric power generation mix.
Technologies will include wind, clean biomass, photovoltaic, solar thermal
and low-head hydroelectric.
   MEURG will evaluate the potential benefits of renewable energy to
utilities and their customers and communicate renewable energy information
to the public. The university may also coordinate workshops, symposia and
seminars and seek federal and private funding for renewable energy
research.
   James Thompson, dean of the College of Engineering, said, ``We are
pleased to participate in this important initiative to explore renewable
energy resources for the state of Missouri. This collaborative effort has
strong potential to benefit the environment and conserve energy resources
by providing an efficient means for exploring renewable energy
resources.''
   Gary Huber, UE's representative in the group, said the university's
involvement offers research advantages. ``It also offers a vehicle for
leveraging research dollars and reducing costs associated with developing
renewable energy projects,'' he said.

IP&L EYEING LANDFILL METHANE-FIRED PROJECT IN INDIANAPOLIS THIS YEAR

   Indianapolis Power & Light could give final approval this month for a
renewable energy project in which an internal combustion engine fired with
methane gas from a landfill would generate 3.5 MW of electricity.
   Dan Melvin, IP&L principal engineer in systems planning, said the
project is in the utility's budget for 1996. If final approval comes this
month, the project is expected to be in operation later in the year. Melvin
told Utility Environment Report., ``We looked at using used equipment. We
are now evaluating proposals from vendors.''
   IP&L included the landfill gas project as part of its ``short-term
action plan'' in an integrated resource plan it recently filed with the
Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.
   In the IRP, the utility said the purpose of the project is to ``utilize
the favorable economics and environmental benefits that are sometimes
available with renewable energy systems.''
   The project would be located at the Southside landfill in Indianapolis.
The current landfill operator already burns some methane to heat a
greenhouse on the site. Under Indiana law, all landfills that accept leaves
and yard waste for disposal must be equipped with methane burners.
   Melvin estimated there is enough methane at the Southside landfill to
last for 10 to 15 years.
   The Southside landfill could set the stage for similar type projects by
IP&L. Melvin said IP&L is negotiating with Allison Engines, one of its
customers, to purchase an 11-MW gas turbine that could be installed at a
site by the late 1990s.

STATE ENVIRONMENTAL OFFICIALS BACK ELEMENTS OF NHA RELICENSING PROPOSAL

   A national organization of state environmental officials said they
support key elements of a proposal by the National Hydropower Association
to revamp the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's project relicensing
procedures, but said the NHA plan needs ``more explicit accommodations for
settlement provisions.''
   The Environmental Council of the States (ECOS), a national, non-profit
organization composed of environmental officials from 50 of the 55 U.S.
states, territories and the District of Columbia, praised the NHA proposal,
filed with FERC in September 1995.
   FERC in October called for comment on the proposal (Docket No. RM-16),
indicating it planned to undertake a rulemaking on relicensing issues. NHA
last month said a formal negotiated rulemaking would allow for timely
reform of the commission's relicensing procedures.
   ECOS praised the NHA proposal's emphasis on reducing the overall time
for reviewing FERC license applications, eliminating redundant reports and
involving all stakeholders at the earliest time possible in the
environmental review process.
   Nevertheless, ECOS said FERC should include provisions to assist states
in settling disputes among stakeholders.
   ``We strongly believe that more explicit accommodations for settlement
initiatives need to be provided by FERC beyond the encouragement given in
the NHA proposal,'' ECOS said, adding that many of its concerns likely
could be resolved by administrative reforms and would not necessarily
require additional rulemaking.
   ``Specifically, there should be provisions to ensure that formal
regulatory positions from involved agencies are not solicited by FERC on
draft [National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)] documents during ongoing
settlement negotiations,'' ECOS said. ``The outcome of negotiations can
greatly accelerate NEPA reviews. Conversely, the quest for reasonable
settlement terms could also be undermined by the continued pursuit of
formal regulatory positions that might constrain the flexibility of
participants in modifying their positions to work toward agreements.''
   FERC could include ``an escape clause'' that would allow the commission
to defer on regulatory steps during ongoing settlement negotiations, ECOS
said.
   ECOS agreed with NHA that the commission's ex parte rules on FERC
communications with participants in the licensing process are another area
in need of reform.
   ``Staff interpretations of ex parte constraints can be extreme and
result in a stifling of communications and early resolution of issues
between FERC and other agencies and participants,'' ECOS said.
   ``Other agencies of government, including our own, are sensitive to ex
parte concerns and yet are able to find ways to do business without
incurring these problems. Any reform proposal for hydropower licensing must
deal with this issue.''
   ECOS questioned the NHA provision that strongly encourages FERC to enter
into a memorandum of understanding with other agencies to coordinate input
on relicensing proceedings, saying that NHA makes no clear statement on why
such an MOU is necessary.
   Alternatively, ECOS suggested that regulations could mandate the
consolidation of federal agency input into hydropower relicensing in a
coordinated time frame.
   In addition, ECOS said the proposal would benefit from ``specific
provisions that facilitate comprehensive river basin planning by providing
financial and/or technical support.''
   ``Such planning is critical to providing a clear and reasonable context
to any cumulative impact assessment in river basins,'' ECOS continued. ``It
is essential to provide a vision of what agencies and the public want in a
river basin and not just the more traditional regulatory view of what they
don't want. This should be extremely valuable to power producers seeking to
secure their future in a given basin.''

WIS. UTILITIES OPPOSING BILL REQUIRING FREE SPARK GAS ISOLATORS FOR
FARMERS

   Wisconsin utilities are opposing a move by a state legislator to require
electric companies to provide spark gap isolators for farm customers who
raise livestock and believe they are experiencing stray voltage problems.
   Rep. Don Hasenohrl recently introduced Assembly Bill 725 that mandates
utilities to install spark gap isolators at no charge if a livestock farmer
hires an electrician who certifies that the farm electric system is wired
so that installation will not create ``a significant safety hazard'' to
persons, livestock or property at the site.
   The bill further provides that if the farmer requests it, the electric
utility must use spark gap isolators with a minimum breakdown voltage of
1,000 volts. A customer may bring action in any court to compel compliance
with these provisions, the bill reads.
   Isolation occurs when the physical connection is broken between the
neutral conductor of the utility system and the neutral conductor of the
farm's electrical system. The National Electric Safety Code states that if
this connection is broken, a device must be installed that reconnects the
conductors at low resistance to enhance safety if a fault occurs or
lightening strikes either the farm or utility system.
   According to Chuck DeNardo, senior engineer at Wisconsin Electric,
utilities oppose A.B. 725 on two major counts. First, it allows the
customer to initiate the decision to break the neutral connection without
evidence that the utility is contributing to the stray voltage problem and
without an understanding of what isolation means.
   Second, the bill eliminates use of lower-voltage reconnection devices
now used by utilities and replaces them with higher-voltage spark gap
isolators. DeNardo explains that the lower the reconnection voltage, the
safer the device. The ``electronic switching'' devices currently used by
utilities have reconnection voltages of about 25 volts, while the bill can
require spark gap isolators with minimum reconnection voltages of 1,000
volts.
   A spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Utilities Association said utilities in
the state have very serious concerns about the use of spark gap isolators
and will be opposing the proposed legislation. A.B. 725 was originally
referred to the Assembly Committee on Agriculture, but an effort is now
under way to have it transferred to the Committee on Environment and
Utilities, whose members are believed to have ``a greater appreciation for
the safety considerations involved,'' the association said.

TUCSON ELECTRIC, NEW WORLD POWER JOINT IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS CHOSEN

   Projects developed by Tucson Electric and New World Power to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries were among eight projects
selected to join the U.S. Initiative on Joint Implementation (USIJI), a
pilot program aimed at finding cost-effective ways to cut emissions and
promote sustainable development.
   Joint implementation, in which companies from developed nations team
with partners in developing countries to reduce emissions, is seen as a key
weapon in the Clinton administration's program for reducing U.S. emissions.
While participating companies may not now claim credit against future
requirements for emission reductions achieved overseas, U.S. treaty
negotiators hope to include amendments that will allow credit for such
projects.
   The eight projects, announced Dec. 19, 1995 in Washington by
undersecretary of state for global affairs Tim Wirth, represent private
sector investments that could top $200-million when the projects are fully
implemented.
   They were selected after a technical review and evaluation of how they
conformed with U.S. joint implementation guidelines by a panel of senior
officials from the Dept. of Energy, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
and six other federal agencies.
   This is the second round of projects to be included in the USIJI
program, which began in October 1993 as part of President Clinton's climate
change action plan. A first round of projects, representing more than
$40-million in private investment, was selected in February 1995 (UER, 17
Feb '95, 10).
   New World Power and its two Costa Rican partners will build a 16-MW
hydropower plant using the Puerto Viejo River and Quebradon Creek in
northern Costa Rica. The project will displace thermal units that burn
high-sulfur diesel fuels, bunker fuels and other fossil fuels.
   New World Power will participate in a second project, also in Costa
Rica, to develop a 20-MW wind power plant. The project will displace
fossil-fuel fired generation, and power will be sold to the Costa Rican
Institute of Electricity.
   Nations Energy, a subsidiary of Tucson Electric, will participate in a
project to develop a 10- to 15-MW biomass plant in Guaimaca, Honduras.
Sawmill and logging residues, currently burned in an uncontrolled manner
and left to decompose on the forest floor, will serve as the fuel source,
making the use of trees for fuel unnecessary and not cost-effective.
   The International Utility Partnership, an industrywide initiative, also
will participate in the Honduras project, whose power will be sold to the
Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica, the Honduran national utility.
   The other projects selected are a carbon sequestration project in Costa
Rica, a geothermal plant in Nicaragua, a second wind plant in Costa Rica, a
forestry management project in Costa Rica, and a project to capture
fugitive methane emissions in Russia.

CANADA DECIDES TO CONTINUE VOLUNTARY GREENHOUSE GAS PROGRAM UNTIL NOV. '96

   Canadian officials have decided to continue using a voluntary program to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, despite a recent plea from the federal
Dept. of the Environment for more aggressive measures to ensure that Canada
stabilizes emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000.
   Canada's greenhouse gas program, called the Climate Change Voluntary
Challenge and Registry (VCR),was launched in 1994 by the federal and
provincial governments and is operated by Natural Resources Canada.
   Resistance to mandatory emission reduction measures is headed by the
province of Alberta, the heart of Canada's fossil-fuel industry, which
emits 30% of Canada's greenhouse gases. The three major utilities in
Alberta strongly favor voluntary approaches over traditional regulatory
plans.
   At a meeting late last year of Canada's federal and provincial
environment and energy ministers in Edmonton, Alberta, officials decided to
continue Canada's reliance on the VCR until November 1996, when ministers
will reassess the greenhouse gas emission picture. This is even though the
federal National Action Program forecasts that emissions will increase 13%
by year 2000 under the VCR.
   At the meeting, federal environment minister Sheila Copps argued that
``without a stronger plan from provinces like Alberta, we're not going to
be there. Alberta's plan is not going to work.''
   But Ty Lund, Alberta's minister of environmental protection, argued that
Alberta was the first province to register a plan with the VCR, and that
firms responsible for 70% of Alberta's greenhouse gases have either joined
the VCR or declared their intent to enroll.
   Alberta energy minister Anne McLellan added that the VCR is rapidly
gaining industry support, including from the Canadian Electrical
Association and the trade associations of the petroleum, natural gas and
coal industries. Initial responses to the VCR have been ``very
encouraging,'' she said, noting that over 475 companies and institutions
have expressed a commitment to participate.
   In the absence of any mandatory control program, Canada's greenhouse gas
emissions have increased by 4.9% from 577 million metric tons in 1990 to
605 million metric tons in 1994. The largest increases were in Saskatchewan
(24%) and Alberta (15%).
   The coal-fired plants of TransAlta Utilities, Alberta Power and Edmonton
Power account for 35% of the provincial emission total. TransAlta, Canada's
largest investor-owned utility with 3,676 MW of coal-fired capacity,
announced a plan last year to cut greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000.
The plan is considered the most advanced in Canada.
   Gordon Lambert, TransAlta's director of sustainable development,
acknowledged that achieving the stabilization goal will be challenging for
TransAlta Corp., the owner of TransAlta and TransAlta Energy. This is
because greenhouse gas emissions from TransAlta Corp.'s Canadian
operations, which include two natural gas-fired, combined-cycle
cogeneration plants in Ontario, are forecasted to increase up to 15% over
1990 levels by 2000 to meet growing customer demand.
   TransAlta Corp. expects to achieve its stabilization target from
renewable energy purchases (13%), customer efficiencies (16%), internal
efficiencies (32%) and domestic and international offsets (41%).
   But Robert Hornung, climate change director of the Alberta-based Pembina
Institute for Appropriate Development, claimed that TransAlta is buying
renewable energy only because such purchases are required under Alberta's
Small Power Research and Development Act. Customer demand-side management
programs are behind schedule and are being scaled back. The agricultural
offsets planned by TransAlta in Saskatchewan are ``not credible,'' added
Hornung.
   The utility's Saskatchewan Soil Enhancement Project involves a
soil-tilling technique using ``low-disturbance direct seeding'' to increase
the carbon dioxide storage capacity of the soil. TransAlta claims the
project can offset up to 1.1 million metric tons of CO2.
   However, Hornung argued that the same logic should apply to TransAlta's
extensive coal mining operations and wetland drainage, which release
greenhouse gases to the atmosphere but are not included in the utility's
greenhouse gas inventory. Moreover, no nation has yet quantified the
changes in soil carbon content arising from human activities.
   TransAlta also is looking for a 13% contribution from international
offsets, which Canada cannot count toward meeting its commitment to
stabilize greenhouse gases, Hornung said. International offsets before the
year 2000 are not credited under the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change.
   In general, Hornung said the VCR is flawed because governments have not
implemented supportive regulatory and fiscal policies.
   Nonetheless, Lambert said that by submitting an action plan, TransAlta
Corp. is making a ``visible commitment to Canada's international obligation
to address greenhouse gases.''
   The Pembina Institute examined 189 VCR submissions by corporations and
governments and reviewed 73 action plans. The review determined that 80% of
companies failed to provide the basic information needed to assess the
credibility of their plans; 37% did not provide a greenhouse gas inventory;
and 72% did not project emission levels by 2000.
   Saskatchewan Power, also a coal-based utility, emits 35% of the
province's total greenhouse emissions. SaskPower's system has 1,997 MW of
coal-fired capacity, but Saskatchewan has not yet developed a CO2
stabilization plan.

TVA PCB WASTE EXCHANGE

   The Tennessee Valley Authority said it was able to save $20,000 in
disposal fees for polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) wastes under an innovative
exchange agreement with the Dept. of Energy's Oak Ridge weapons plant.
   Under the deal, TVA transferred 75,000 gallons of oil with slight PCB
contamination to Oak Ridge's K-25 plant site where it will be used to rinse
three 22,500 gallon tanks that had previously contained PCB wastes and are
now being decontaminated.
   Since the PCB level in the TVA oil is much lower than what had been in
the tanks, flushing with the TVA oil will be a useful initial step in the
decontamination process.
   According to Oak Ridge officials, without the oil from TVA they would
have had to spend up to $80,000 for new oil that would end up becoming
contaminated.
   Oak Ridge has a toxic waste incinerator at the K-25 site that is
licensed to destroy PCBs. It will eventually dispose of the TVA oil in the
facility at no extra cost to TVA or itself.

N.Y. CHANGES OFFSET RULES

   The New York Dept. of Environmental Conservation has changed two rules
affecting the use of nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compound
``offsets.''
The first change, which amends Subpart 231-2 and Part 621 of New York's
Title 6 regulations, requires applicants for permits to construct air
contamination sources, such as power plants, to identify the source of the
NOx and VOC emission offsets prior to issuance of the final permit to
construct. Previously, applicants had to supply the information at the time
the application was submitted to the department.
   The DEC also has proposed extending the deadline for reporting
reductions of NOx and VOCs. Reductions prior to Oct. 14, 1994 would have to
be reported by Oct. 14, 1996, instead of 1995, as originally planned.
Reductions after Oct. 14, 1994 would have to be reported within two years.

PSE&G BERGEN REPOWERING

   Public Service Electric & Gas expects significant emission reductions
and water benefits at its 650-MW Bergen Generating Station, which went back
into service with more efficient equipment.
   The station, built in 1959 to burn coal, was converted to oil and gas in
1970. In the $360-million repowering project, four combustion turbines were
installed, along with a waste-heat recovery boiler that uses heat from the
turbines to produce more power.
   Although the station will produce an additional 40 MW, nitrogen oxide
emissions will be reduced by 96%, or 10,000 tons/year, while carbon
monoxide will be cut by 63%, and carbon dioxide by 30%. PSE&G already is
marketing its NOx ``credits'' from this and other projects to businesses in
New Jersey and elsewhere in the region (UER, 9 June, 1).
   Along with the air benefits, PSE&G will cut water use and eliminate
thermal discharge at Bergen. The station will use treated waste water from
a county sewage treatment plant instead of water from Overpeck Creek, and
it will recycle the waste water back to the treatment plant instead of
discharging it into the Hackensack River.

VA. SCC COMPETITION PROBE

   Virginia's State Corporation Commission said that as part of its formal
investigation into electric power industry restructuring, it will examine
its environmental policies ``to determine if they are compatible with
desirable competition'' (Case No. TUE950089).
   The SCC said its probe, which could lead to a plan for expanding
competition among utilities and other power suppliers, will include ``an
analysis of whether increased competition will impact a utility's
willingness to take appropriate steps to address environmental concerns.''
Environmentalists in other states moving toward competition have expressed
concerns about the impact those changes would have on conservation efforts,
the development of renewables and the use of dirtier coal-fired plants to
generate cheap power.

EX-KAN. MUNI OFFICIAL SENTENCED

   The former superintendent of the Stafford Municipal utility in Kansas
has been sentenced to six months of home confinement and fined $3,000 in
connection with the illegal dumping of nine capacitors filled with
polychlorinated biphenyls.
   William Kirkpatrick originally was indicted on two counts by a federal
grand jury, one involving ordering the illegal disposal and a second of
failure to report it (Criminal No. 94-10094-01) (UER, 2 Sept '94, 10). The
former charge was dropped after he pleaded guilty to the latter, the U.S.
Attorney's office in Wichita said.
   The original charges carried a maximum penalty of four years in prison
and a $275,000 fine. The revised charges could have cost Kirkpatrick
$250,000 and three years in prison.
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney said Kirkpatrick will be
electronically monitored during his home confinement.
