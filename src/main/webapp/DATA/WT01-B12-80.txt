<H2> EXOTIC BLEND </H2>

<P>   JUNGLE ADE is an exotic blend of tropical fruits that grow in the pristine Amazon Rainforest -- rich in vitamins, minerals and all kinds of phytonutrients that can be found nowhere on earth other than in this diverse incredible ecosystem.  These exotic fruits, Camu-Camu, Passion Fruit, Guava, Cashew Fruit and Cupuacu are full of important nutrients as nature intended and contain many synergistic phytonutrients never before seen.</P>

<H2>TOTALLY ORGANIC</H2>
<P>   As North American agricultural methods, which utilize synthetic fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, continue to destroy the balance of our soils and disturb the natural balance of nature, the fruits and vegetables growing in the totally natural environment of the Amazon basin in South America become more and more important. The fruits used in the JUNGLE ADE formula are 100% totally organic and free of chemical contaminants.</P>

<H2>NEVER BEFORE</H2>
<P>   RAINFORCE JUNGLE ADE includes several new and delicious fruits, never before offered in North America or Europe, which have been harvested in the Amazon Jungle by indigenous tribes and local communities. These exotic fruits have been juiced and then dried by a new and proprietary process, which preserves their valuable phytonutrients, preserving everything that nature intended in a convenient dry granular form that is easily mixed with water in your home to make a delicious and nutritious beverage.</P>

<H2>CAMU-CAMU</H2>
<P>   One of the rainforest's newest discoveries is a delicious fruit by the name Camu-Camu. It is included in Life Plus JUNGLE ADE for its high nutritive value and pleasant taste. This small lemon-sized fruit is presently the highest known source of natural Vitamin C on the planet and grows wild in the Amazon Rainforest. Camu-Camu, also known as Rumberry·, provides 3,000% of the Vitamin C, 300% of the Niacin, 200% of the Riboflavin and 150% of the Phosphorous than oranges.</P>

<H2>CASHEW FRUIT</H2>
<P>   In addition to Camu-Camu, JUNGLE ADE contains Cashew Fruit, also known as Cajueiro, Cupuacu, Maracuja and Guava fruits. Unlike the well known cashew nuts that are so popular all over the world, Cajueiro is a highly nutritious fruit.  It is very peculiar and really isn't a fruit at all.  It is actually a swollen peduncle that grows behind the real fruit, which is the cashew nut. This large pulpy and juicy part of the plant is actually referred to as a pseudo-fruit with a fine sweet flavor and aroma. The cashew nut grows externally on one end of it in its own kidney shaped hard shell.  Interesting Amazonian folklore include the cashew juice as an aid for flu and colds, a sexual stimulant, and other things.  Cashew fruit contains five times the amount of Vitamin C as oranges, too.</P>

<H2>CUPUACU</H2>
<P>   The Cupuacu fruit is in the chocolate family and looks much like the fruit of the chocolate tree. The Life Plus RAINFORCE makes Cupuacu fruit available for the first time in North America and Europe. Rich in phytonutrients with a delicious exotic taste, Cupuacu has been a primary food source in the rainforest, both for the indigenous people and animals alike. It is about the size of a cantaloupe and is highly prized for its creamy, exotic tasting pulp throughout the Amazon basin. it is used throughout Peru and Brazil to make fresh juice, ice cream, jam and tarts.</P>

<H2>PASSION FRUIT</H2>
<P>   An important constituent of JUNGLE ADE is Passion Fruit. A certain species known as Maracuja, is the type that grows in the Amazon Rainforest and is the one included in JUNGLE ADE. Maracuja juice has been used a wonderful source of power packed phytonutrients as well as a good tasting fruit.</P>

<H2>GUAVA</H2>
<P>   Guava, also known as Goiaba, is enjoyed as a sweet treat by indigenous people throughout the rainforest. It has traditionally been recommended as a natural fruit for diabetics and for those needing to maintain consistent blood sugar levels. It tastes great and contains a high concentration of health-supporting plant enzymes.</P>

<H2>HELPING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
 <P>  All of the natural fruits contained in JUNGLE ADE have been ecologically harvested using indigenous tribes to help protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Providing education and a new income source derived from harvesting a sustainable natural resource like all five of the delicious fruits found in JUNGLE ADE and herbs in other Life Plus RAINFORCE products, helps provide an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforest resource. For instance, world renown ethnobotanist, Mark Plotkin states that " a forest stand of Camu-Camu is worth twice the amount to be gained from cutting down the forest and replacing it with cattle." He believes the rational nurturing and harvesting of medicinal herbs and the nutritious fruits contained in JUNGLE ADE holds real economic promise for local Amazon communities. The Life Plus RAINFORCE is proud to be the first to make this important new resource available to North America and Europe and is dedicated to be the leader in helping to create an economical alternative to destroying the rainforest.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to preserve the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>


<H2>HOW TO USE JUNGLE ADE</H2>
  <P>  Stir, shake or blend one or more teaspoonfuls of JUNGLE ADE concentrate, according to taste, per each eight ounce glass of clear, contaminant-free  drinking  water  to  make  a  super-tasting, phytonutrient-rich, health beverage. It can be mixed one glass at a time or by the quart or half gallon.  Store in refrigerator after mixing. JUNGLE ADE can be used just as a nutritious, enjoyable beverage or can be used to swallow supplement tablets for the synergistic phytonutrients it contains.  JUNGLE ADE is great to use in mixing with powdered protein drinks like <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mpromax.htm">PROMAX</A> and for preparing <A HREF="http://vitality.simplenet.com/mcolodyn.htm">COLODYNE</A>. For milk lovers, a fruit creme can be easily made by mixing JUNGLE ADE about 50/50 with milk.   Think of JUNGLE ADE as a replacement for carbonated soft drinks and sugary childrens' drinks as well.</P>
