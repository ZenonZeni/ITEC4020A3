The Subtleties of Closed-End Fund Rights Offerings </H2><P>
<HR>

Since mid-1991 there have been an unprecedented number of rights offerings by closed-end funds. Three took place in 1991, 18 in 1992, 33 in 1993, and 20 were completed  by mid-1994. Diversified domestic equity, sector, single country, taxable bond, and municipal bond funds have all had rights offerings.<P>


The proliferation of closed-end fund rights offerings has prompted numerous questions from shareholders and responses from financial writers. Do shareholders really benefit or is it mainly the management who profits (since management fees are paid as a percentage of assets)? The answer depends on the timing and other details of the individual offering and whether or not the shareholder takes action.<P>


Unlike mutual funds, closed-end funds do not have a continuous cash inflow from new share issuances. This can be frustrating to a successful manager who would like an infusion of additional money into the portfolio. There are two ways closed-end funds can raise additional money; a rights offering and a secondary public offering. The former is far more common than the latter. Rights are used to raise more money from existing shareholders at what management feels is an appropriate time, commonly--but not always--during a bull market.<P>


The basics of closed-end fund rights offerings were covered in "Closed-End Fund Rights Offerings: What They Mean for Shareholders" by Seth C. Anderson and Pat Eason (AAII Journal, June 1994). However, the complexity of the subject warrants a closer look at the subtleties of these offerings. In addition, the class-action suit filed in early 1994 by a Nuveen Premium Income Municipal Fund shareholder against the fund claiming that its rights offering was dilutive, demands that we examine the meaning of the word "dilution," as well as the different ways in which a rights offering can be structured.<P>


Let's begin with a brief review of the fundamentals.<P>


<H3>How Rights Offerings Work</H3>


Shareholders are usually issued one right for each share held--for instance, a shareholder with 100 shares would receive 100 rights. The rights can be used to purchase additional shares at a predetermined subscription price, commonly 5% to 10% below the fund's market price (or average price) as of a particular date. A right is a short-term option. Most closed-end rights offerings allow shareholders to exercise their option within several weeks. When the rights expire, they are worthless.<P>


Normally, several rights--typically three or more--are needed to acquire each new share. The subscription ratio depends on how many shares are now outstanding as well as the number to be issued. Here's a simple example. If Fund A has 9 million shares and wants to issue an additional 9 million shares (a 100% increase), the subscription ratio would be 1:1. Usually the subscription ratio is higher than 1:1, however. In a more typical case, if Fund A wanted to issue 3 million shares, three rights (9 million ÷ 3 million) would be required to buy each new share.<P>


It's important to recognize that the higher the subscription ratio, the smaller the percentage increase in shares outstanding. A 5:1 subscription ratio would result in a 20% increase in shares whereas a 20:1 ratio would increase shares by only 5%.<P>


The value of a right "rights on," when the rights and stock sell together as a package (i.e., prior to the stock going "ex-rights"), can be calculated with the formula appearing in Table 1. When the stock goes ex-rights its price falls by the value of one right and the denominator in the formula becomes "N" (rather than "N + 1"), as illustrated in Table 1.<P>



<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table 1. Valuing a Right</STRONG>
<PRE>
<STRONG>Formula</STRONG>


                M - S
R (rights on) = -----
                N + 1


   where:

   R = theoretical value of one right

   M = market price of fund

   S = subscription price

   N = subscription ratio



<STRONG>Example</STRONG>


M = $10.00, S = $9.00, and N = 3


Value of a right "rights on":


                ($10.00 - $9.00)
R (rights on) = ----------------
                     (3 + 1)

              = $0.25


Ex-rights market price:


Ex-rights price = ($10.00 - $0.25)
                = $9.75


Value of a right "ex-rights":


                ($9.75 - $9.00)
R (ex-rights) = ---------------
                       3

              = $0.25

<H3>Shareholder Dilution</H3>


Rights offerings dilute the positions of shareholders who don't participate when the fund trades at a discount. The size of the pie (total assets) grows but its slices (net asset value per share) shrink because there are more shares. It's important to recognize that the dilution affects only those shareholders who don't exercise their rights or sell them (if they are transferable).<P>


Here's an example. The hypothetical Discount Fund has 10 million shares and wants to add two million more. The fund trades at $8.50, 15% below its $10.00 net asset value. The subscription price is set at $8.00, almost 6% below the market price. If the offering is fully subscribed, Discount will raise $16 million, ignoring any fees. Its assets increase to $116 million and it now has 12 million shares. Its net asset value falls from $10.00 to $9.67 ($116 million ÷ 12 million), a 3.3% dilution, as seen in Table 2. The market price would also be expected to decline, as it typically does with a rights offering. Dilution can be a major problem when a fund trades at a deep discount and the amount of money raised is small in proportion to the number of new shares.<P>



<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table 2. The Effect of NAV: Discount Fund Example</STRONG>
<PRE>
Net asset value = $10.00; Market price = $8.50; Subscription price = $8.00


new capital = subscription price x new shares 
            = 8.00 x 2,000,000
            = $16,000,000



                  Before            New           After
                 Offering         Capital       Offering

---------------------------------------------------------

Assets ($)     100,000,000      16,000,000    116,000,000

Shares (No.)    10,000,000       2,000,000     12,000,000

NAV ($)           10.00              --           9.67

</PRE>
<HR>
<BR>
Conversely, if a fund trades at a sufficient premium, a rights offering can actually increase net asset value. Premium Fund has total net assets of $100 million and 10 million shares outstanding. Management wants to offer two million shares to existing stockholders. The fund trades at $11.00, 10% above its $10.00 net asset value. The subscription price is set at $10.50, a 4.5% discount from the market price. <P>


How will the offering affect shareholders' net asset value? Ignoring fees, Premium Fund will raise $21 million if the offering is fully subscribed. Its total assets increase to $121 million and it will have 12 million shares. Net asset value rises from $10 to $10.08 ($121 million ÷ 12 million), as seen in Table 3.<P>



<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table 3. The Effect on NAV: Premium Fund Example</STRONG>
<PRE>
Net asset value = $10.00

Market price = $11.00

Subscription price = $10.50


New capital = subscription price x new shares
            = 10.50 x 2,000,000
            = $21,000,000


                    Before          New            After

<HR>

The near-term effect is beneficial for shareholders because the fund traded at a 10% premium. Nevertheless, the ultimate test of the offering's success is how profitably the $21 million of new capital can be put to use.<P>


<H3>Important Difference Among Offerings</H3>


Many closed-end rights offerings are non-transferable--the rights can't be sold separately from the stock in the open market. Conversely, transferable rights can be sold in the secondary market during the "ex-rights" period by shareholders who choose not to exercise them. Non-transferable rights offerings have been called coercive by critics, since shareholders may not realize that they do not need to add to their holdings to realize their value. We'll explain later how shareholders who don't want to increase their investment can still derive the value from non-transferable rights.<P>


Arbitrageurs may seek to profit from a transferable rights offering. These large traders would sell short shares of the fund at its market price and buy rights for each share shorted, based on the subscription ratio. Shorting the stock would push its price down allowing the arbitrageurs to profit while the shareholders' value is reduced. You might also have arbitrage with a non-transferable rights offering, according to the manager of a large fund that had a non-transferable offering in 1993.<P>


Rights offerings are completed in one of the following two ways:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Internally administered by the fund company.<P>


<LI>Underwritten by an investment banking syndicate.<P>
</UL>

Underwritten offerings involve significant fees and commissions paid to firms that promote them to their retail customers. These costs, which range from 2% to 4% of the capital raised, diminish shareholders' value. Over half of the closed-end fund offerings in 1993 had these extra fees. Funds that choose the underwriting route tend to be members of large complexes that have a significant number of initial public offerings, and want to remain on good terms with their underwriters. Unfortunately, however, you as a shareholder have to absorb this cost, which is dilutive, even if you participate in the offering. Incidentally, underwriting fees were a factor leading to the shareholder's class-action suit in the Nuveen case.<P>


A good argument can be made that solicitation fees are an unnecessary expense. Morningstar data indicate the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Of the 33 rights offerings in 1993, 5 were undersubscribed.<P>


<LI>Of those 33, 12 carried no solicitation fees and all 12 of those were fully subscribed.<P>
</UL>

Internally administered offerings such as those of Adams Express, Baker Fentress, Bergstrom Capital, Royce Value Trust, and Tri-Continental, seem to be successful and cost their shareholders little in the form of fees.<P>


Duff & Phelps Utilities Income had much better experience with its $249 million internally administered offering in 1994 than it did with its $93 million underwritten offering in 1992. The first offering was undersubscribed; the more recent offering was oversubscribed. The earlier offering allowed shareholders to subscribe at net asset value (which was below market price since the fund traded at a premium) whereas the more recent offering was priced at a 10% discount to the lower of net asset value or market price, thereby passing along the benefit to the shareholders rather than the underwriters. Shareholders also received more advance notice of the second offering from Duff & Phelps, which also contributed to its greater success, according to the management.<P>


<H3>The Ideal Rights Offering</H3>


The ideal rights offering has four characteristics:<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is fully subscribed, enabling the fund to raise all the money it intends.<P>


<LI>It is successfully completed without the payment of extra fees to have broker-dealers manage the offering.<P>


<LI>It is perfectly timed and occurs in a market environment where the proceeds could be invested in securities that offer outstanding appreciation potential.<P>


<LI>It does not lead to the "strategy-dilution effect."<P>
</UL>

The fourth point refers to the fact that a rights offering may generate proceeds that the fund manager decides to invest in a type of security that the portfolio does not ordinarily focus on. For instance, a small-cap manager may invest in larger stocks if there are insufficient opportunities in small caps at the time the proceeds become available. Strategy-dilution is not common, but it can happen.<P>


Fund companies might prefer to issue rights when their shares trade at a premium to avoid dilution. But some do it when their shares are at a discount and they see good values in the stock market. Royce Value Trust, Emerging Mexico, and Latin America Investment are examples of funds that have done this. Their loyal shareholders benefited as the undervalued markets and funds subsequently rebounded. Incidentally, Royce Value Trust has had a rights offering every year since 1989 so shareholders can "dollar-cost average." Manager Charles Royce tries to increase the assets by 5% each year, using a 20:1 subscription ratio. By keeping the offerings small Royce minimizes dilution to net asset value.<P>


<H3>Be Prepared to Act</H3>


Never, never, never let a rights offering catch you off guard! First, you need to read the prospectus describing the offering carefully. The worst scenario is to do nothing. One way to be prepared is simply to have a reserve of liquid assets sufficient to participate, if you feel the conditions are right for adding to your investment.<P>


But suppose you're strapped for cash or you simply don't want to increase your dollar commitment to the fund because you feel it's not the best time. Or perhaps your fund is held in an IRA and you can't invest more. If the rights are transferable you can sell them on the open market. Do so quickly, as the stock typically declines during the offering period. This is one way to minimize your dilution.<P>


If the rights are non-transferable you can do your own arbitrage to capture at least some of their value:<P>


Assume you own 3,600 shares of a fund that has a non-transferable rights offering. The subscription ratio is 3:1, so your 3,600 shares allow you to subscribe to 1,200 new ones. The subscription price is $9.00 and the market price is $10.00. These are the same assumptions used in Table 1, where each right was found to be worth $0.25.<P>


Ignoring commissions, you could simply sell 1,200 of your shares (based on the subscription ratio) at the "ex-rights" price of $9.75 ($10.00 - $0.25), for a total of $11,700, then exercise your rights and purchase 1,200 new shares for $9.00 each, or $10,800.<P>


The result? You are $900 better off than if you had done nothing--in other words, you have made $900 before commissions and taxes, and you still hold 3,600 shares. The sooner you arbitrage, the more value you are likely to lock in.<P>


A recap of the arbitrage appears in Table 4.<P>



<HR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Table 4. Shareholder Arbitrage: What to do if Rights are Non-Transferable</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI>Original position: 3,600 shs. @ $10.00 = $36,000<P>


<LI>Receive 3,600 rights; 3:1 subscription ratio @ $9.00 price<P>


<LI>Sell 1,200 shs. @ $9.75 "ex-rights" price, netting $11,700<P>


<LI>Subscribe to 1,200 shs. @ $9.00, $10,800 total cost<P>


<LI>Arbitrage profit: $11,700 - $10,800 = $900<P>


<LI>Position After Arbitrage: Value of stock $35,100 (3,600 shs. @ $9.75) + Arbitrage profit $900 = $36,000<P>


<LI>Position without Arbitrage: 3,600 shs. @ $9.75 = $35,100<P>
</UL>

<HR>



Of course, the sale of shares is a taxable event if they are held outside a tax-deferred account, and you have to pay commissions. But the sale of transferable rights would also involve a commission and be taxable, since rights have a zero cost basis.<P>


<H3>Advantages of Rights Offerings</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Rights offerings can be good for the fund and its shareholders. By raising capital in sensible amounts at opportune times the fund can build its portfolio and perhaps even lower its expense ratio a bit. Management can add new positions without having to sell off existing holdings to raise money.<P>


<LI>The offering can give you the chance to increase your ownership at a favorable price, if its terms are attractive and the fund appears to have good investment potential.<P>


<LI>Rights offerings can create buying opportunities for those who aren't shareholders. If the offering exerts sufficient downward price pressure it can result in an attractive discount for the vigilant bargain hunter.<P>


<LI>You can benefit from the oversubscription privilege if you want even more shares than you were originally entitled to. Most offerings include an oversubscription privilege, which provides for the pro rata allocation of shares for which rights were unexercised to interested shareholders at the subscription price.<P>
</UL>

<H3>Disadvantages of Rights Offerings</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Rights offerings can be dilutive. Once an offering is announced, the fund's share price tends to drop in anticipation of the dilution. Rights offerings dilute the holdings of shareholders who don't act. If the fund sells at a discount of 10% or more, dilution can be considerable.<P>


<LI>Rights offerings handled through investment bankers can be costly, since the extra broker-dealer fees can be as high as 4%. High fees can dilute all shareholders--those who participate as well as those who do not--since the fees come out of the fund's assets.<P>


<LI>Critics call them coercive. But, as we've seen, they need not be. If the rights are transferable you can sell them. If they are non-transferable you can simply sell some shares (in accordance with the subscription ratio) at the current market price and exercise your rights to restore your original position.<P>


<LI>They might be made when the market is near its peak--and the fund trades at a premium. New capital would be invested in a pricey market, even without dilution.<P>


<LI>Managements can be criticized for being greedy--using the rights offering simply to increase assets and total management fees.<P>


<LI>There can be a strategy-dilution effect if the management invests the new money in a type of security in which the fund does not normally invest.<P>


<LI>Rights offerings can be confusing to unsophisticated investors. Investing in closed-end funds requires more knowledge and homework on the part of the investor than investing in mutual funds.<P>
</UL>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>


All closed-end fund investors should understand rights offerings, even if they've invested in a fund that has never had one. You never know when you might experience one since their usage has increased dramatically during the past few years. Trying to predict whether or not a fund will have a rights offering is almost like trying to predict what the stock market is going to do.<P>


Rights offerings are relatively complex and you should think carefully if your fund presents you with the opportunity. Be sure you understand all the facts. Also, if your shares are held in street name be sure your broker contacts you about the offering; some may not.<P>


Inaction is the biggest mistake you can make.<P>
