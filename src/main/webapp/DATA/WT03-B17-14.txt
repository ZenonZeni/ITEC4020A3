<font size=+3><b>PVC Firm Only So Flexible</font></b>
</center>

<hr>
<i>by Joshua  Levine</i><p>

<img src="../caps/acap.gif" align=left border=0 alt="A">mong the HCMC firms to have caught the eye of equity-seeking investors is Binh Minh Plastco, owned by the Ministry of Light Industry and first established as a private company in 1972. The HCMC firm was one of six that had initiated steps toward equitization several years ago, (along with other HCMC firms REE, Legamex, Hiep An Shoe Factory, Vifoco and Gemadept), although it has since backed away, so as to access necessary capitalization.<p>

The firm, which enjoyed 50% growth for the last six years despite a long-time lack of capital, is considered a competent, focused business that stands out in its field.<p>

Last year the firm employed 220 and held assets worth $2 million, including working capital of $500,000.<p>

Binh Minh mainly produces PVC-based pipes and tubing used in construction, telephony and water drainage, made according to international standards. In 1995, its estimated output was about 5,000 tons, compared to 3,600 tons in 1994 with a turnover of $6 million and profits of $590,000. Binh Minh is known for producing high-quality goods compared to the about 20 other firms which undercut their price.<p>

Despite this success, the company found its three year preparation for equitization an excessive burden. Ironically, its status as a promising company grooming itself for sophisticated private financing prevented it from qualifying for any financing at all. While the company needed a new production line costing up to $5 million, it could not borrow long-term capital in that transitional status, until the National Assembly passes legislation allowing for such loans to be made prior to equitization.<p>

Finally the company withdrew from the equitization process to qualify for a loan. Said Ms. Nguyen Kim Bich at a recent public business meeting in HCMC, "The Government recently consented to lend our company more than $6 million to import a new production line allowing us to increase competitiveness."<p>

Binh Minh's dilemma was typical of other state-owned enterprises considering equitization.
Soon after it received the $6 million loan, the firm bought shares of a recently formed State-owned telecom operator, Saigon Postel. The purchase made Binh Minh Plastco a better candidate for success as an SOE than it perhaps would have been as an equitized company open to foreign investors.<p>
