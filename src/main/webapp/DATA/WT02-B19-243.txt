The National Training Program for Gifted Education at The Council for Exceptional Children is
funded under the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program, U.S.
Department of Education.  This 3-year project has provided continuing education opportunities
for teachers, administrators, and other professionals who are involved in the education of gifted
and talented students.  Specific goals included:

<ul><li>Advancing the education of gifted students by providing research-based, state-of-the art
training and materials that increase the capability of school systems and personnel to identify
and provide educational services to this population.<P>

<li>Advancing the education of all students by making the pedagogy of gifted education more
accessible to professionals in the broader education community.<P>

<li>Extending the options available to trainers in gifted education in state, regional, and local
educational agencies, and in other institutions by providing an organized base of training
materials and informational products for use in new or established training programs.</ul><P>

<b>PROJECT ACTIVITIES AND FOCUS</b><P>

activities to diverse audiences:

government, and business.<p>

educators, administrators, supervisors, and other personnel involved in preservice and inservice
