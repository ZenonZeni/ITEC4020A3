Technologies</title>

<h2>Part II.	Parental and User Control Technologies Available Today 
to Screen Unwanted Content</h2>
<p>
<p>
<h3>Overview -- Dealing With Inappropriate Material in Cyberspace Through Technology</h3>
<p>
Interactive media such as the Internet and commercial online services 
such as America Online and Prodigy offer users tremendous control over the 
information that they and their children receive. Unlike traditional mass 
media which "assaults" viewers with content, interactive media requires 
users to seek out information from any number of the millions of available 
World Wide Web sites, online file archives (ftp, and gopher), and from any of 
the more than 3000 Usenet newsgroups.
<p>
The vast majority of the content available on interactive media is 
related to normal every day topics such as politics, educational resources, 
sports, consumer information, shopping, to name just a few. In addition, 
millions of people use the Internet every day to conduct business, socialize, 
organize political activities, and communicate on issues of interest to them. 
However, just like in the terrestrial world, there are areas of cyberspace which 
may contain materials that are not appropriate for children. 
<p>
Preventing children from successfully gaining access to such material is 
an important issue which must be addressed. However, because cyberspace is 
a global network with millions of users, active policing of content by 
governments, besides the obvious implications for free speech and privacy 
rights, is simply not a practical or effective solution.
<p>
There is a growing market for applications that empower users and 
parents to control their children's access to inappropriate materials on the 
Internet and commercial online services.  This document provides an 
extensive (though by no means exhaustive) overview of some of the 
technologies currently available.  All but two of the tools mentioned here are 
currently available to consumers across the country.
<p>
Four categories of technological options are examined here, each 
provides a slightly different, but equally effective, point of intervention.
<p>
<b>1.	Commercial Online Services Parental Control Features</b>
<p>
The Parental Control Feature of three of the most popular commercial 
online services (America Online, Prodigy, an Compuserve) are illustrated. 
These features are embedded in the service and are available to all subscribers 
of these services at no additional charge.
<p>
<b>2.	Features for the Home PC and Direct Internet Access</b>
<p>
For families that do not subscribe to one of the commercial online 
services but instead receive direct access to the Internet, there are a variety of 
products that run right on the home PC (SurfWatch, NET NANNY, and 
CYBERsitter). Some of these products are also compatible with and can run in 
addition to the parental control features available on the commercial services.
<p>
<b>3.	Applications for Schools and Businesses</b>
<p>
Schools and corporations can employ server based technologies such as 
the Netscape Proxy Server and WEBTrack to prevent users from accessing 
inappropriate content while in the classroom or at the office.
<p>
<b>4.	Proposals for the Future</b>
<p>
In addition to these examples of products currently on the market, 
there is a innovative proposal being offered by Nathaniel Borenstein and 
Darren New. KidCode, a proposed Internet protocol, is a voluntary rating 
system that can prevent children from accessing content that may not be 
appropriate.
<p>
<p>
<h3>A. 	Child Protection in Commercial Online Services</h3>
<p>
Commercial online services such as America Online, Compuserve, 
and Prodigy offer technologies that allow parents to block their children's 
access to certain online forums where children might be exposed to 
inappropriate content.  Other services run filtering software which 
automatically screens messages posted to public forums that contain language 
inappropriate to children.
<p>
<b>1.	America Online Parental Control Features</b>
<p>
America Online (AOL), one of the large commercial online service 
providers, contains a feature which allows parents to prevent their children 
from accessing interactive discussion forums (a.k.a. "Chat Rooms"). A small 
minority of these forums, which are areas provided by America Online and 
are accessible only to AOL's subscribers, sometimes contain language and 
other discussion which may not be suitable for children. Parents are 
empowered to prevent their children from accessing these areas simply by 
selecting a menu option and entering a password. The block out function 
cannot be de-activated without the password. 
<p>
America Online also offers parents the ability to block access to Usenet 
newsgroups based on keywords, subject matter, or specific newsgroups. For 
example, parents can configure their system to block access to newsgroups 
containing the word "sex", or can block access to specific news groups such as 
"alt.sex.binaries.pictures". This mechanism is not exclusive to sexually 
explicit materials -- the software can be configured to block access to groups 
based on any keyword. Configuring this system is as simple as clicking a 
button and describing the keywords or groups to be blocked. 
<p>
Concerned parents, even if they are less computer literate than their 
childnre, have easy access to these control features.  AOL provides telephone 
help, detailed instructions and advice for parents. There is no additional cost 
for this service, and, like the other parental control features on AOL, the 
feature cannot be turned off without a password known only to the parent.
<p>
Finally, on July 17, 1995, America Online announced that they had 
entered a partnership with SurfWatch Software (described below).  Starting in 
the fall of 1995 AOL will provide SurfWatch as part of is regular service, 
preventing children from accessing sites on the Internet known to contain 
sexually explicit material.  SurfWatch will run continuously, unless disabled 
by the parent, and will provide a further layer of protection for children who 
use America Online.
<p>
<b>2.	Prodigy Internet access restrictions</b>
<p>
Prodigy runs special screening software that monitors messages posted 
to public bulletin boards and chat rooms on the Prodigy network, and 
automatically blocks messages which contain language  (such as the "seven 
dirty words"), and other content deemed inappropriate for children.
<p>
Like all the major commercial online services, Prodigy offers users 
access to the Internet. Prodigy will not provide customers access to the 
Internet without the authorization by the head of the household (the 
principal account holder). The authorization is made at the time of the 
account setup and requires credit card verification. This additional child 
protection feature is designed to ensure that parents are aware that their child 
has access to the Internet where Prodigy cannot control the content.
<P>
Finally, Prodigy offers parents the ability to monitor which sites their 
child has visited on the World Wide Web.  Each time a site is visited, the 
Prodigy software records that site in a log which can be displayed at a later 
time.  Parents can keep track of where their children have gone in cyberspace, 
and can instruct their children not to visit sites which may contain 
inappropriate materials (based on their own personal values).
<p>
<b>3.	Compuserve: Internet in a Box for kids</b>
<p>
Compuserve, another of the large commercial online services, recently 
announced a partnership with SPRY Inc. (makers of the popular "Internet in 
a Box") and is currently developing two child protection features: Internet In 
a Box for Kids, and KidNet.
<p>
Internet In a Box for Kids contains a program called Crossing Guard, 
which will allow parents to control their children's access to the by blocking 
access to sites that may contain inappropriate materials. Crossing Guard will 
also allow parents to monitor their children's online activities and set timers 
to control when and how long their children can surf the net.
<p>
Parents who purchase Internet In a Box for Kids will automatically 
become subscribers to KidNet, an electronic community designed specifically 
for kids. The site will allow members to congregate, chat, exchange 
information, shop, and play interactive games. All content on KidNet will be 
closely monitored to ensure that it is appropriate for children. The area will 
also be designed to offer teachers and adults access to educational sites, school 
networks and other resources for education and information geared to kids. 
KidNet will also include a home page builder that will allow kids to develop 
their own Internet resources.
<p>
The product will begin shipping in the Fall of 1995. Information 
is currently available at the Compuserve/Spry Home Page: 
http://www.spry.com
<p>
<h3>B.	Parental Empowerment Applications for the Home PC and 
Direct Internet Access</h3>
<p>
Although many parents subscribe to commercial online services such 
as those mentioned above, access to the global information highway is not 
limited to commercial online services. Many parents, educational 
institutions, and corporations choose to access the directly through an 
Internet Access Provider.  Unlike commercial online services, access 
providers generally do not provide any of their own content.  Because of this, 
parental control features must be initiated on the Home PC. 
<p>
There are a variety of software developers working on parental control 
features for this market. Some of these applications can be used in 
conjunction with commercial online services, over and above the parental 
control features provided by commercial services, while others are designed 
specifically for direct access.
<p>
<b>1.	'Surf Watch'</b>
<p>
Surf Watch Software is designed to provide parental control for 
families who do not subscribe to commercial online services.  SurfWatch 
allows parents to block their children's access to Usenet newsgroups, World 
Wide Web sites, gopher and file archives (ftp sites) which are known to 
contain sexually explicit material.  When activated with a private password 
held only by a parent, Surf Watch completely prevents any user from 
accessing these areas. The program is launched when the computer is started 
up, and operates when the parent is not present.
<p>
SurfWatch employs a group of professional "net.surfers" to find out 
and log sites on the where sexually explicit material is located. Sites are 
reviewed by a group of concerned parents and educators to determine the 
nature of the content, and those sites which meet specific criteria are added to 
a list which is embedded in the program.
<p>
SurfWatch software resides on the home PC. When activated, the 
program cross-checks every attempt to access Usenet newsgroups, world wide 
web, gopher, and ftp sites. Sites which are included on the list are blocked 
automatically.  Because the new sites are constantly appearing on the net, 
SurfWatch provides a subscription service that automatically updates the list 
of sites to be blocked, without any intervention required from the user. 
Subscribers can receive updates as frequently as they choose.
<p>
Surf Watch Software maintains the list of sites the program will block, 
and will make custom lists available if requested. SurfWatch will also soon 
provide users the ability to add an delete sites to their own custom lists  
<p>
SurfWatch is available now for under $50.00. Information on 
SurfWatch is available on the world wide web: 
http://www.surfwatch.com/
<p>
<b>2.	NET NANNY</b>
<p>
NET NANNY, developed by Net Nanny Ltd. of Vancouver BC Canada, 
is designed to prevent children from accessing areas on the Internet that a 
parent deems inappropriate, prevent children from giving their name, 
address, telephone number, credit card, or other personal information to 
strangers via email or chat rooms, and can log off an online service or shut 
down the computer when the child attempts any of these activities.
<p>
The program contains a dictionary in which the parent can enter the 
names of sites known to contain sexually explicit or other[1] material (e.g., the 
Usenet newsgroup "alt.sex" hierarchy, or the web site http://www.playboy.com). Parents may also enter phrases such as "what's 
your name?", "what's your phone number", "where do you live", or "are 
your parents home?". If anyone attempts to ask these questions, NET 
NANNY will automatically log off the network or shut down the computer.
<p>
NET NANNY can also be configured to block access to files on the PC's 
hard drive, floppy drive and CD-ROM, to prevent a child from accessing and 
altering the parent's financial records, work related files, and programs and 
files intended only for adults.
<p>
Finally, the program keeps a log of all activity that occurs on the 
computer, allowing parents to monitor their children's use of the computer.  
By using this feature, parents can determine if their children are using the 
computer to access inappropriate material, and can then augment the 
Dictionary to prevent further access.
<p>
NET NANNY is compatible with commercial online services and 
direct Internet access providers. The program is launched when the computer 
is started up, and operates when the parent is not present.
<p>
The program is available for Windows users for $49.95. More 
information can be found on the World Wide Web: 
http://www.netnanny.com/netnanny
<p>
<b>3.	'CYBERsitter'</b>
<p>
CYBERsitter, developed by Solid Oak Software in Santa Barbara 
California, allows parents to monitor their children's computer activity and 
can prevent a child from downloading image, sound, and video files. It will 
also prevent children from accessing files on the home PC hard drive such as 
financial information, business related files, CD-ROM titles, and anything else 
a parent determines their children should not have access to. The program is 
launched when the computer is started up, and operates when the parent is 
not present.
<p>
CYBERsitter keeps a log of all activity on the computer, including 
access to the, commercial online services, and local files on the hard drive, 
CD-ROMs and floppy disks, enabling parents to monitor their children's use 
of the computer.
<p>
CYBERsitter is available for $29.95. More information, and a free 
demonstration version of the product (for Windows) is available 
on the world wide web: http://www.solidaok.com/~solidoak
<p>
<h3>C.	Solutions in the Schools and Businesses -- Server Based 
Applications</h3>
<p>
In addition to the commercial online services and home access 
environments, may schools (from K-12 to universities) and corporations are 
beginning to provide access to the Internet. Many of these organizations are 
becoming increasingly concerned about the availability of not only sexually 
explicit materials, but also games, sports information, gambling sites, and 
other areas which may not be appropriate for access during school and work 
hours.
<p>
Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server and WEBTrack provide 
schools and businesses the ability to block specific sites from access by all uses 
on the network, and to track an monitor use of the Internet.
<p>
<b>1.	Netscape Proxy Server</b>
<p>
The Netscape Proxy Server, developed by Netscape Communications 
Corporation (the developer of the popular World Wide Web browser), allows 
schools and business to block access to specific sites on the Internet, 
individual computers (IP addresses) and other information.  The Server 
operates in the background and does not require teachers or employees to 
have sophisticated programming knowledge or configure any feature. The 
systems administrator is responsible for operating the server and for 
maintaining the list of sites to be blocked.
<p>
The Server can be configured to block access to specified World Wide 
Web, file archives (ftp), and Gopher sites on the for users on the network on 
which the server is deployed. In other words, a school or business which runs 
the Netscape proxy server can prevent students or employees from accessing 
sites known to contain sexually explicit materials, information about drugs, 
gambling, sports, games, and anything else determined to be inappropriate for 
users on the network.
<p>
<b>2.	WEBTrack</b>
<p>
WEBTrack, developed by Webster Network Strategies in Naples 
Florida, allows businesses to block access to certain pre-determined sites on 
the Internet. The product gives businesses the capability to restrict access to 15 
categories of World Wide Web, Gopher, and ftp sites (including sexually 
explicit material, games, gambling, job search information, drugs, online 
merchandising, sports, humor, and others), while allowing full access to a 
wide variety of resources. The product is designed to promote the use of the 
Internet for business purposes while restricting recreational use.
<p>
On July 17, 1995, Webster Network Strategies announced that it would 
provide its software free to K-12 schools, ensuring that all of America's 
children who access the Internet from the classroom will not be able to 
stumble upon inappropriate material.
<p>
WEBTrack also allows corporate systems administrators to monitor 
employee use of the network in order to determine if an employee is using 
the to access materials which violate stated corporate policy.
<p>
WEBTrack is available for most major network servers, and 
costs approximately $7,500.  Updates of the site list are available 
on a subscription basis for $1,500 per year.
<p>
<b>D.	Future Applications and Protocol Solutions</b>
<p>
<b>1.	Information Highway Parental Empowerment Group</b>
<p>
A consortium assembled by Microsoft, Netscape Communications, and 
Progressive Networks recently announced plans to develop technical 
standards to enable voluntary rating of a variety of content available through 
the Internet and other online services.  These standards would enable content 
creators to voluntarily label their own content so that individuals and 
families can block the material, if they chose.  In addition, the Information 
Highway Parental Empowerment Group (IHPEG) will create standards to 
allow "third-party" rating of content online.  Much as TV Guide rates TV 
shows on broadcast television, IHPEG would enable multiple third-party 
rating of content available online.
<p>
<b>2.	KidCode</b>
<p>
Among the more innovative of proposals on the drawing boards is 
KidCode, currently being developed by Nathaniel Borenstein and Darren 
New. KidCode, a proposal for an Internet protocol designed to block access to 
sites based on a common voluntary rating system, is in the early stages of 
development, but would be compatible with all of the parental control 
applications currently on the market. 
<p>
KidCode is a proposed convention for labeling World Wide Web and 
other sites on the Internet as containing material which may not be suitable 
for children. There are an infinite number of possible categories (e.g., sexually 
explicit material, violent material, drug related material, etc.). 
<p>
Content providers and individuals who create web 'Home Pages' could 
voluntarily incorporate a standardized KidCode tag in the address of the site. 
Browser applications would be configured to read these tags and determine if 
the content on the site is appropriate for the viewing.
<p>
In addition, KidCode can accommodate third party ratings, age 
verification, and other factors. Finally, because KidCode is a voluntary rating 
system that may not be employed by every content provider on the, it can be 
configured to block access to sites that do not contain KidCode tags. In other 
words, if a site chooses not to use KidCode, a child using a KidCode enabled 
program would not be able to access that site regardless of the content it 
contains.
<p>
The Borenstein-New KidCode proposal is still in the early stages 
of development and has not yet been deployed. Further 
information can be obtained automatically by sending email to 
nsb+faq@nsb.fv.com. 
<p>
<h3>Prospects for the future</h3>
<p>
The products described here represent only a fraction of what is 
currently available to empower parents to protect their children from 
inappropriate material on the Internet.  Moreover,  these are only the 
beginning, as the industry is committed to developing more and better 
solutions, and the open nature of the Internet provides a wealth of 
possibilities for parental empowerment tools that may not yet have been 
imagined.
<p>
The availability of material on the Internet which may be 
inappropriate for children is a serious issue and one of `legitimate concern,  
However, because the Internet is a global network with millions of users, top-
down, command and control content restrictions simply cannot effectively 
control the availability of such materials.  The only effective way to protect 
children from inappropriate material on the Internet is to encourage the 
continued development and deployment of tools that empower parents to 
control their children's online activities based on their own individual tastes 
and preferences. The products descried here provide parents these tools, and 
can do so without the need for burdensome legislation or government 
imposed content restrictions.

<i><b>Footnotes</i></b>
<p>
1 NOTE: The list of blocked sites is entirely determined by the parent. The parent can block access to sites that contain any materials they do not wish their children to access, including but not limited to games, drugs, rap music, violence, or guns. A Net Nanny spokesman indicated that pre-programmed lists will be available from the company soon.
