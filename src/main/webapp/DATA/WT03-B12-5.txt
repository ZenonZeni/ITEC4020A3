WARREN PUBLISHING ACQUIRES WASHINGTON TELECOM NEWSWIRE

     We're very proud to announce that Warren Publishing has
purchased Washington Telecom Newswire, a unique daily news service
covering the telecommunications industry.  As a wide variety of
Communications Daily subscribers already know, Washington Telecom
Newswire can be a very powerful complement to the Daily.

     Newswire subscribers receive, via fax or e-mail,
Washington-based telephone industry news stories throughout the
business day, usually within an hour of the event.  FCC and
congressional hearings, corporate press conferences and major
telephone industry developments are reported in Washington Telecom
Newswire before they appear anywhere else -- including "on the
Internet."

     The Newswire was purchased from Editor and Publisher Christine
Valmassei, who began the service in 1993 and will continue as
editor and publisher.  The Newswire will remain separate from Comm
Daily, with a separate editorial staff.

     Beginning in 1945, Warren Publishing pioneered first in
weekly, then daily and now almost hourly coverage of
communications.  As the pace continues to pick up in the industry,
we're ready for the next 50 years.

     We eagerly invite you to sample Washington Telecom Newswire at
no cost or obligation.  Simply call Warren Publishing Circulation
Manager Betty Alvine at 202-872-9200.

FCC SHUTDOWN MAKES IT DOUBTFUL JAN. 18 AGENDA MEETING WILL BE HELD

     Scheduled FCC agenda meeting on Jan. 18 now is very much in
doubt because of extended govt. shutdown over budget fight between
Administration and congressional Republicans.  It's Commission
policy that staff items to be considered at open meetings be sent
to commissioners by bureaus and offices involved 21 days before
meeting (CD Oct 23 p4), although that deadline can be waived by
commissioners.  Jan. 18 date hasn't been canceled formally, but FCC
sources told us it surely will be.  Other Commission matters also
will be delayed when govt. returns to work, they said, because no
one has been around to work on issues, digest comments, etc.

     Agency had scheduled Jan. 30 en banc session on spectrum
issues to be chaired by Comr. Ness because of her special interest.
At that meeting, new ways to allocate spectrum were to be discussed
by invited witnesses.  Commission is required by law to meet at
least once each month and there's now talk that Jan. 30 session
will be considered as meeting for month.  However, since agency
legally can't put out notices or news releases during
budget-mandated shutdown, any decisions must await its formal
return to work, according to sources.

     Among hardest hit by shutdown have been contractors, such as
maintenance, security, vending, transcription services.  Martin
Clark, pres. of ITS Inc. document service, said he's losing $20,000
daily and has laid off all but 10 of his work force of 45.  A few
are on board because auctions generated small amount of business,
he said.  Clark said he kept his employees on payroll during
week-long shutdown in Nov. but couldn't afford it in Dec. layoff.
He said he doesn't expect to recoup losses because experience has
shown his average daily revenues of $20,000 "don't change" after
snow days and other shutdowns.  ITS paid employees for Christmas
Day because "I just had to," Clark said.  "I'm angry, very angry
about this.  Millions of people across the United States that do
work for the government are hurt by this shutdown."

     Although most FCC employees were sent home because of lack of
funds, some were permitted to continue working on such things as
auctions, court arguments and international matters (CD Dec 19 p2).
FCC's Block C PCS auction began Dec. 18, first day of shutdown, and
ran through Dec. 21, when it took holiday recess.  Specialized
Mobile Radio (SMR) auction also continued week of Dec. 18.  SMR
auction resumes Jan. 2, Block C auction Jan. 5.  Auction staff
continued to work last week.  Call to Auction Div. Fri. revealed "7
or 8" employees were on board along with Wireless Bureau Chief
Michele Farquhar and Assoc. Bureau Chief Rosalind Allen in front
office.

     We're told couple of staffers from Office of Legislative &
Intergovernmental Affairs were in briefly Thurs. but were were gone
next day.  Gen. Counsel's office was staffed week of Dec. 18
because 2 court arguments were held that week.  Common Carrier
Bureau now is nearly empty, with only one employee classified as
essential to oversee network reliability;  same is case with Mass
Media Bureau.  "I am literally the only person on this floor," said
FCC employee on 8th floor Fri.

     Some commissioners have been seen entering and leaving
building from time to time during 2-week shutdown, not staying
long, but according to law their personal staffs aren't permitted
to work.  However, during Nov. shutdown, commissioners' staffers
continued to work by telephone, mostly from their homes, and in at
least one case met in Va. home of Jane Mago, senior legal adviser
to Comr. Chong, on children's issue in approval of Westinghouse
takeover of CBS (CD Nov 20 p1).

     Likely to be delayed by shutdown is approval of Disney Co.'s
$19-billion purchase of Cap/ABC, which had been expected to be on
agenda for Jan. 18 meeting.  Numerous deadlines for filing comments
have passed while Commission has been closed, including on AT&T
request to be reclassified as nondominant carrier for international
services, Southwestern Bell request to be classified as nondominant
provider of interstate services and Ameritech request to assess
end-user common line charges to resellers.  In addition to
comments, FCC will be hit with avalanche of petitions, complaints
and applications once agency reopens.  One lawyer said stacks of
petitions cover table in his firm's conference room, all waiting to
be filed.  "I can't imagine the long lines that will form" at FCC
filing rooms once shutdown is over, PCIA Regulatory Dir. Robert
Hoggarth said.

     Meanwhile, on Fri. President Clinton resumed meetings with
Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Gingrich
(R-Ga.) in effort to resolve budget issues.  Meetings were expected
to continue through New Year's weekend.

HILL SAYS BROADCASTERS WON'T GET 'GIVEAWAY'

     Republican congressional sources close to negotiations on
budget and telecom bills said Fri. that staff-level negotiations
have rejected White House proposal for broadcasters' early return
of analog spectrum in exchange for digital spectrum.  Sources said
no deal has been reached on spectrum issues as high-level talks
continued at White House.  They also said that there would be "no
giveaways" to broadcasters as part of final budget deal.  Statement
contradicted assertion by Senate Majority Leader Dole (R-Kan.), who
was reported by Reuters Thurs. as objecting to what he called
"giveaway" of spectrum to broadcasters.  Dole also said there were
problems with telecom bill, but he wouldn't elaborate.

     Sources said some published estimates of value of analog
spectrum to be given back after conversion of broadcasting services
to digital technology have been wildly exaggerated.  While some
reports have put value of spectrum as high as $70 billion, sources
said figure is more in neighborhood of $6 billion.  That amount,
they said, wouldn't include costs to society of having industry and
consumers convert to new technologies before either is ready.
Negotiators also rejected White House proposal for $1-billion
subsidy to consumers to help them adjust to conversion through
purchase of set-top boxes.  Forcing consumers and industry in short
term to use technology that market hasn't found to be ready could
short-circuit development of advanced TV (ATV) services, Hill
sources said, adding that FCC has wide discretion to determine
whether ATV licenses should be awarded and what conditions should
be attached, including disposition of analog spectrum.

     Dole's assertion that there were "3, 4 or 5 provisions" in
bill that needed fixing also raised intriguing situation of having
him contradict rest of Senate leadership, including Commerce
Committee Chmn. Pressler (R-S.D.) and senior committee Democrat
Hollings (D-S.C.), who said deal is in final form.  House
Republicans haven't accepted that, and still were working to make
changes, principally in sections that had been removed from bill
and that they wanted restored.

     For example, House sources said that Senate wanted removal of
provision that would preclude FCC from regulating Internet,
provision that was in House bill but not in Senate's.  House
measure, sponsored by Reps. Cox (R-Cal.), Wyden (D-Ore.) and White
(R-Wash.), passed by 420-4 as part of wider piece of bill also
aimed at combating cyberporn.  Republican sources said debate on
regulation provision revolved around argument that there's no
telling what services Internet would carry in future, whether it be
common carrier, mass media or video now regulated by separate
titles of Communications Act.  It didn't make sense to "preempt
regulation in perpetuity," sources said.  Sponsors were working to
have clauses restored.

     Similarly, Rep. Oxley (R-O.) would like language revived that
would lift restrictions on foreign ownership of common carrier
licenses.  Sources said there was no agreement between House and
Senate on measure, so it was dropped because Senate language that
would allow FCC to revoke licenses of foreign owners of U.S.
businesses was "worse than nothing."  Conferees will begin to
receive conference report this week after returning from break.
But some senators not only received it, but signed it, before
leaving for Christmas.  It will be up to parliamentary experts to
determine status of conference report if lawmakers have signed,
believing it to be final version, while others say it's still open
for discussion.  House sources said bill isn't final until majority
of conferees have voted for it, but at same time they don't expect
major changes.

     House sources said that bill "substantially reflects the work
of the House" in conference, noting particularly requirement for
facilities-based competition pushed by Commerce Committee Chmn.
Bliley (R-Va.), and checklist concept of Telecom Subcommittee Chmn.
Fields (R-Tex.).  Other parts, however, were "watered down by the
Senate," sources said, although Bliley believed that final product
should be supported.  Sources said House Speaker Gingrich (R-Ga.)
hasn't directed that specific changes be made, although meetings
this week may cover those subjects.  Gingrich and Majority Leader
Armey (R-Tex.) have said that problems with bill need to be
resolved.

CELLULAR MARKET GROWS 71.4% WITH ACCELERATED EXPANSION IN SOME
NATIONS

     Worldwide cellular market expanded 71.4% to 71.1 million from
mid-1994 to middle of last year, fueled by triple-digit gains in
emerging markets and healthy growth in industrial nations of
Europe, Asia, U.S. Commerce Dept. said in annual survey.  Through
6 months, growth was 35.6% globally, up from 52.4 million at end of
1994.  U.S. accounted for 43% of subscribers, followed by Japan
with 7.5%.  Scandinavian countries accounted for highest
penetration rates, in excess of 10%.

     "Midyear worldwide cellular subscribers reveal that the market
is still growing at an incredible rate," said Stephanie McCullough,
telecom analyst in Commerce's International Trade Administration
(ITA).  "There are developments on the horizon which will surely
accelerate that growth in several countries."

     Competition in Japan and Israel spurred double-digit growth --
122% in Japan and 110% in Israel, she said, as 2nd networks
accelerated subscriber base.  Similar trends are likely when
Belgium, Ireland, Korea, Taiwan and Poland introduce competition
this year, she said in report.  Indonesia ended 25% import duty on
cellular phones, which should cut prices from current $800-$2,500
range and accelerate growth, McCullough said.

     Small countries posted phenomenal growth "where the
introduction of wireless service is one way to meet the vast
pent-up demand for telephones," she said.  Colombia (1,666%),
Lebanon (1,100%), Bulgaria (723%), Ukraine (542%) and Belarus
(500%) led world, but markets of Greece (162%), Spain (93%), Norway
(76%) and Sweden (71%) also boomed, she said.

     Million-user group includes U.S. (31 million), Japan (5.3
million), U.K. (4.5 million), Germany (2.93 million), Italy (2.86
million), China (2.5 million), Australia (2.4 million), Korea (1.4
million) and France (1.1 million) as of mid-1994.  Poised to join:
Thailand (983,000), Norway (800,000), Brazil (750,000), McCullough
said in report, available only on Internet on ITA homepage
(http://www.ita.doc.gov).

     Latest survey, issued as govt. shutdown began, said Chinese
market could be most interesting this year, with UniCom building
out Global System for Mobile network to compete with provincial
networks.  Country will offer analysts opportunity to test dynamic
of 2 govt.-owned systems in competition.  "China, too, holds huge
potential for cellular growth," McCullough said.  Delays in
awarding licenses in India retard access to huge market, and use of
GSM technology could limit U.S. exports somewhat, she said.

     National breakdown showed govt. delays in Haiti have pushed
back award of national cellular license from late Sept. until early
this year, and in Austria collapse of ruling govt. threatened delay
in GSM tender offer.  In Australia, Spectrum Management Authority
is phasing out analog network with conversion to all-digital
technology by Jan. 2000, report showed, with users encouraged to
shift to Telstra, Optus and Vodaphone GSM networks.

     City of Baltimore has complained to American Personal

     City of Baltimore has complained to American Personal
Communications (APC) about interference from company's new PCS
service.  In Dec. 27 letter that also was sent to FCC, Md. Attorney
General's office said APC's PCS service is harming communications
service that supports Baltimore's mass transit system.  Utilities
Telecom Council (UTC), trade association that represents microwave
incumbents, said letter "validates the concerns that incumbents
have long expressed over the potential interference and severe
service disruption" that PCS could cause to microwave operators.
City said that on at least 2 occasions, APC created such serious
interference that Baltimore's communications links had to be
rerouted to telephone lines.  In both cases, it said, APC
transmitter was tuned improperly to interfering frequency.  City
said communications interruptions "posed a grave threat to public
safety," particularly since police communications also were
threatened.  Letter comes as APC is negotiating with Baltimore to
relocate city's communication system.  City said in letter that it
wants reimbursement for costs it incurred "as the result of APC's
negligent failure to properly tune and operate its transmitter."
Reimbursement can be either condition of future relocation or
separate payment if relocation agreement isn't reached, city said.

     CompuServe Pres. Robert Massey said Fri. he doesn't expect to
encounter opposition from other on-line services as result of
company's decision to block access to 200 Internet-based bulletin
boards at request of German prosecutors.  In interview on CNBC,
Massey said:  "CompuServe will comply with the law.  You will get
no argument from other on-line service providers over that.  This
is a major issue we are all wrestling with.  It's a very
controversial issue."  Massey said that although some members have
posted comments critical of CompuServe's actions, he hasn't heard
of any subscribers' dropping service.  He said CompuServe was in
unique position compared with other on-line services because half
of its subscribers are outside of U.S.  List of banned sites
circulating on Internet included several containing pornographic
photos but appeared to be based on words in their title rather than
content.  Some of banned areas include:  (1)
Alt.sex.bestiality.barney, reference to children's program
character.  (2) Alt.sexy.bald.captains, homage to Star Trek
character Capt. Jean-Luc Picard.  Several have discussions of gay
issues.
