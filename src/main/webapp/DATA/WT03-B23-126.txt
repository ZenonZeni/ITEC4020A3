<P>
Although Tucker Anthony is a full-service investment firm like the
large national firms, it has stayed very close to its roots by
remaining small and financially solid, with an emphasis
on addressing clients' needs. As a small, cohesive organization, Tucker Anthony
ensures cost-control while maintaining its ability
to quickly and effectively adapt to changes in the market. Our
financial strength ensures that we will continue to meet your
investment needs not only during the good times, but during the
bad times as well. What really sets Tucker Anthony apart from
its large competitors is how we service our customers.

<P>
In the old days on Wall Street, brokers were called "customers'
men." Their role was to serve their clients' needs,
rather than to distribute products as they do today.
We like to think that Tucker Anthony Investment Executives are
"customers' people." Rather than have a client
fill out a computerized questionnaire that will purportedly enable
the client to set up an automatic investment program designed
to meet their exact investment needs, we believe it's better
to sit down with our clients and discuss in more detail their
investment objectives and concerns -- we like to know our clients
 firsthand. But don't just take our word for it. 	<A HREF="listen.htm">Listen to What Our Clients Say About Us!</A><BR>
