<H2><I>C. </I>Energy-Efficient Appliances and Equipment Provide Significant 
Energy Savings</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a number of states established 
efficiency standards for major home appliances, and appliance 
manufacturers petitioned the federal government to establish uniform 
preemptive national standards. These were enacted as the National 
Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987. There are now national 
efficiency standards for most categories of home appliances and equipment. 
The U.S. DOE periodically reviews and updates these standards. Although 
efficiency measures add a small extra cost to products, the efficiency 
standards are set at levels where the extra costs are rapidly offset by 
energy savings.<a href="#228" name="r228"> [ 228 ] </a><BR>

 of Selected Appliance Standards<br clear=all><hr></I></h3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>     Residential appliance standards alone are already saving consumers 
$1.9 billion annually, and ultimately will save consumers $132 billion net 
over the lifetime of products purchased by 2030, providing a ratio of 
total benefits to costs of 3-to-1.<a href="#229" name="r229"> [ 229 ] </a>Past and necessary future appliance 
and equipment standards could cut residential electricity use 7 percent by 
the year 2015, saving about 80,000 gigawatt-hours and 21,000 megawatts of 
capacity annually<a href="#230" name="r230"> [ 230 ] </a> - which represents approximately 50.6 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide reductions per year.<a href="#231" name="r231"> [ 231 ] </a>
