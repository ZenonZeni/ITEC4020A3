<H1>Climate change <BR>
and the Geneva Convention<BR>
on Long-Range Transboundary Air 
Pollution</H1>
<HR>
<B>Although drafted in response to acid rain, the Geneva Convention is potentially 
relevant to climate change.</B> The treaty was adopted in 1979, when greenhouse 
gases and their effects on climate were not yet a major issue. It seeks to control the 
emission and cross-border flow of "air pollutants", defined as substances which, when 
released into the air, have harmful effects on human well-being and on flora, fauna, and 
ecosystems. This broad definition does not envisage the greenhouse effect as such, but it 
can be applied to a number of greenhouse gases and their precursors. The Geneva 
Convention was adopted under the auspices of the UN Economic Commission for Europe 
(ECE) and is limited in scope and membership to European and North American 
countries. It entered into force in 1983. As of January 1993, 35 states and the European 
Community are parties to it. <P>
<B>The Convention provides a general framework for the control of air 
pollution.</B>  More specific obligations are set out in the accompanying protocols. The 
Convention’s Executive Body reviews the progress that party states are making on their 
commitments under the Convention<P>
	to endeavour to limit and then, as far as possible, to reduce air pollution; <P>
	to attempt to develop "without undue delay" policies and strategies to  combat air 
pollution;<P>
	to initiate and coordinate research on the causes and effects of air pollution and on new 
technologies for reducing emissions;<P>
	to exchange information on scientific research, policies, and measures relating to air 
pollution;<P>
	to hold consultations between upwind "polluter" states and downwind "victim" 
states.<P>
<B>The four protocols adopted within the framework of the Geneva Convention 
have some relevance to climate change.</B> The 1988 Sofia Protocol on nitrogen 
oxides (NOx) and the 1991 Geneva Protocol on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) both 
seek to limit emissions of substances which are precursors of the <A HREF = 
"fs002.html">greenhouse gas</A> tropospheric ozone (O3).1 
The 1985 Helsinki Protocol aims to limit sulphur emissions. As the presence of sulphates 
in the stratosphere tends to promote global cooling, this may also have some impact on 
climate change. Under the EMEP programme, governed by the 1984 Geneva Protocol, 
data on air pollution are collected and monitored.<P>
<B>Parties to the Sofia Protocol must stabilise nitrogen oxide emissions.</B>  The 
Protocol entered into force in 1991 and, as of January 1993, has 20 Parties.  It imposes 
the following obligations:<P>
	to stabilise the emissions or cross-border flows of nitrogen oxides at 1987 levels. This 
must be done by 1994 at the latest, and should represent just a first step. Parties  are free 
to choose a base year from before 1987;<P>
	to apply national emissions standards to major new emissions sources. States must also 
introduce pollution control measures for all major existing stationary sources;<P>
	to start negotiations on further reductions of nitrogen oxide emissions;<P>
	to facilitate the exchange of information and technology for reducing nitrogen oxide 
emissions;<P>
	to make unleaded fuel for vehicles equipped with catalytic converters available  within 
two years of the Protocol’s entry into force;<P>
	to review the Protocol regularly as new scientific and technical information becomes 
available;<P>
	to carry out research and to develop national policies and strategies for implementing the 
Protocol. <P>
<B>The 1991 Geneva Protocol provides that annual VOC emissions must be 
reduced by at least 30% by 1999.</B>  It sets 1988 as the base year, but Parties may 
choose a different base year from between 1984 and 1990.  Parties with low 1988 
emissions levels (specified in the protocol) must at least stabilise emissions by 1999.  The 
Protocol also obliges states to apply emission standards to all new sources of VOCs and 
to products containing solvents, use the best available technologies that are economically 
feasible, review the Protocol regularly and negotiate further emissions reductions, establish 
a mechanism for compliance monitoring, set up national programmes to fulfill their 
obligations, and co-operate in the exchange of technology and information.  It also 
specifies that compliance with its provisions does not relieve parties from fulfilling other 
international obligations, including those related to combating climate change.  The 
Protocol was signed by 23 states and will enter into force upon ratification by 16 
states.<P>
