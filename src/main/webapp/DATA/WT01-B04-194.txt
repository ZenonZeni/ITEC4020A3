<h3><A NAME = "Individual Educational Plans">Individual Educational Plans:  Identifying Individual Student Needs</A></h3><P>

In developing Individual Educational Plans (IEPs) for students with
disabilities, a variety of factors are taken into consideration to determine
which regular and special education services are needed by the individual
student.  The same factors are used for placement in a VE class.  This section
provides a brief description of the factors.  These factors can be readily
translated into guidelines appropriate to the specific use of the VE model in a
district or school.<P>

<h4>What are the factors? </h4><P>
<b>At what level is the child currently functioning?</B><P>

<h4>Functional level/Curriculum Needs</h4>
<p>
Review the child's level of achievement or           
functioning for all of the specific developmental    
                          domains, and academic or vocational areas.  Use      
                          both standardized test scores and reports of         
                          classroom teachers.  Only current test results       
                          that are considered to be a valid reflection of      
                          the child's achievement should be used to            
                          determine the functional level.  Frequently,         
                          group-administered achievement tests do not          
                          accurately reflect the capabilities of exceptional   
                          students.  
<p>
Observations of classroom behavior and    
                          input from the child's current teachers can          
                          provide critical information.  A review of both      
                          regular and special education classroom              
                          performance should be taken into account.            
                          Determine how well the student functions in a        
                          large group situation; how well the student can      
                          meet the demands of homework, independent            
                          assignments, and the social and behavioral           
                          expectations of the environment.
<P>
<h4>Curriculum needs and Pupil-Progression Plan</h4>
<p>
Determine if the child's needs are best met through the requirements of the regular              
                          pupil-progression plan or through the special        
                          pupil-progression plan for exceptional students.     
                          This will involve selecting the type of curriculum   
                          and, for secondary students, selecting the type of   
                          diploma.   Generally, the academic curriculum has    
                          been effective for exceptional students who are      
                          considered high-functioning or mildly handicapped.   
                          The functional life-skills curriculum is generally   
                          selected for low functioning students.               
<P>
<h4>Medical needs/Physical Impairment</h4>
<P>   
Determine need for any support services for medical needs or accessibility requirements due to   
                          physical limitations.                                
<P>
<h4>Behavior and Independence</h4>              
<P>
Consider the child's capacity for functioning independently in the school;  review the child's     
                          history in terms of self-regulation and behavior     
                          control.  

<p>Can a behavior management plan be          
                          reasonably implemented in the targeted setting?      
                          How will the child's behavior impact the others      
                          already in the classroom?  

<p>Can the child make        
                          appropriate decisions independently?  Is a crisis    
                          intervention teacher needed?                         
<P>
<h4>Social Skills</h4>             
<p>
Determine the child's capacity for functioning in    
                          a social environment;  review the child's            
                          relationships with peers and adults.  

<p>
Is a  separate social skills class appropriate for the  student?                                             
<P>
<h4>Long-range Career Plans</h4>   
<P>
For high school students, review career goals and    
 objectives to determine appropriateness of  secondary school placement.                          
<P>
<h4>Parent and Student Input</h4>  
<P>
Input should be obtained from both parents and       
                          students regarding these factors.  Both can          
                          provide information regarding their perceptions of   
                          the student's readiness for the proposed placement. 
<P>
<b>What special services are needed?</b>

<P>
<h4>Related Services</h4>
<P>          
Determine if any related services are required.      
                          This may include counseling, medical services, or    
                          other educationally related services.                
<P>
<h4>Course Modifications</h4>      
<p>
Review the need for course modifications,            
                          including modifications to time, communication       
                          modes, instructional techniques, or assessment       
                          procedures.   
<p>
Determine if needed technology is      
                          available to support the performance of the          
                          student.   
<p>
Consider the use of the Mainstream Cost   
                          Factor to suport consultation between regular        
                          education and ESE teachers.                          

<P>
<h4>Multiple Program Needs</h4>    
<p>
Consider the need for services from exceptional      
                          student education programs, such as speech,          
                          physical or occupational therapy, as well as other   
                          educational programs including Chapter 1, English    
                          for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), or           
                          vocational education.                                
<P>
<h4>Transition Services</h4>       
<p>
For high school students, review transition plans.   
                          This may include involvement of other agencies,      
                          such as Developmental Services from Health and       
                          Rehabilitative Services, and Vocational              
                          Rehabilitation from the Department of Labor.         
<P> <b>What are the placement options?                                                  </b>
<P>
<h4>Least Restrictive Environment</h4>        
<P>
Select the most normal educational setting in        
which the exceptional student can profit from the    
                          instruction.   To the maximum extent appropriate,    
                          exceptional students should be educated with         
                          nonexceptional students.  Encourage attendance at    
                          the student's home school, if possible.              
<P><h4>Availability of Delivery Models</h4>
<P>
Review the continuum of delivery models currently    
 available in the district.    
<P>
<h4>Availability of Support Personnel</h4>
<p>
Input may be           
                          obtained from the potential receiving teacher(s)     
                          and district staff.  This should include a           
                          description of the delivery models and               
                          characteristics of students served in each.          
                          Information regarding the  availability of           
                          curriculum and support services should be            
                          provided.                                            
<p>
Determine the ease of providing support personnel,                    if needed, in the targeted setting.

<p>
Open lines of communication must be maintained to    
                          ensure parent support.  When parents have input      
                          into the process, they will be more likely to work   
                          in a partnership with the school.                    
<P>

<h3>Conducting Successful Annual IEP Reviews</h3>
<p>
The following suggestions are provided to exceptional student education
teachers to help them prepare for successful IEP review meetings.<P>
<ul>
<li>Come with <i>recommendations</i> for proposed goals and objectives.

(i.e., to set educational goals for their student for the next year).<br>
<li>Have all participating teachers make positive comments about the student's
past performance.<P>
<li>Have each participating teacher explain the proposed goals for the student.
Make sure the parents and student understand the goals and give them the
opportunity to add others.

sure parents are aware of the configuration of the classroom and the rationale
for placing their student in this setting.
<li>Listen carefully to what the parents and student are saying.  Add additional
information, if appropriate.  You may recommend strategies you have found
successful that can be used at home.
<li>Express any concerns you have in a positive manner.
<li>Thank the parent and student for attending and end the conference with a
positive comment about the student.
<li>Remember:  Follow through on any promises that were made at the conference.

<h3>
<A NAME = "Dealing with Parental">Dealing with Parental Concerns</A></h3><P>

The State Board of Education Rule requires parental notification when a student
is assigned to a VE class. Beyond that, there should be a close working
relationship between the parents of an exceptional student and the teacher in a
varying exceptionalities class. The parents should be informed about the
characteristics of and the circumstances within the class, including the class
size, the functional levels of the students, and how this may relate to the
progress of the child.  <P>
<b>How can participation of the parents be encouraged?</b>
<p>
Frequent conferences should be held to discuss the student's progress, and the
parent should always be requested to attend. Parents need an opportunity to
share their ideas and concerns with the school.  If face-to-face conferences
are not possible, telephone conversations may be used.  Stay away from written
communication only.  Keep communication positive in nature.  Keep parents
informed about opportunities for participation in school activities.  They may
be interested in attending group functions such as:<P>
<ul>
<li>Parent Information Night
<li>Field Trips
<li>PTO/PTA participation
<li>School Advisory Councils<
<li>Parent Advisory Councils
</ul>
<p>
Here's a program that works to keep parents involved in the instruction of their children.
<p>
Call the parents of each student in the class at least once before
Thanksgiving.  By dividing up the students by class periods, all parents can be
contacted within a 3-5 day period. If a student has no phone, use a handwritten
letter to communicate.  The calls concentrate on the child's strengths.   The
teacher asks about the student's interests, hobbies and special
accomplishments.  Areas for improvement are then discussed.  Parents can make
excellent suggestions and certainly appreciate the communication.  Laying the
positive background makes it much easier to deal with concerns that might
occur. <P>
(from <i>Doris Wayte, Pinellas County</i>)<P>

<b>How can parents' concerns about the varying exceptionalities class be
addressed?</b><P>
<ul>
<li>Invite the parents to visit the VE classroom.
<li>Encourage parents to spend time talking about the class with the students and
the teacher.
<li>Encourage the parent to talk with other parents of students already in the
class.
<li>Make all curriculum materials available for parental review.<
<li>Create brochures explaining the different types of delivery models.
<li>Present  various delivery models at the parent support group meetings to
foster a smooth working relationship with parents.
<li>Create a parent library.
<li>Ask the parent to serve as a volunteer.
<li>Suggest that they seek advice from local or state parent support groups.
<li>Refer them to the Bureau of Education for Exceptional Students/Clearinghouse
Information Center or their local FDLRS center for resources and information.</UL></DL><P>
