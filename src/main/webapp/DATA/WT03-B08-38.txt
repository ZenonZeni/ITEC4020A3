From The Editor's Desk

This month's issue of Surface Modification Technology News includes
a wide variety of topics.  Although there is no "lead" or special
article on a particular process or new material, several items are
key to the future of surface modification.

We review a new process called Jet Vapor Deposition.  Its
co-founders claim that this evolutionary procedure has several key
advantages in thin film deposition: low cost, uniformity, and high
throughput.  According to all reports, it bears watching in the
future.

Following on our feature in the April issue, we again discuss the
use of the laser for surface modification.  A short but important
article features laser chemical vapor deposition for
microelectronic packaging operations.

Continuing our efforts to keep on top of various diamond film
developments, we describe the epitaxial growth of diamond on a
nickel substrate accomplished by researchers in Japan.  In addition
we include another article on the use of diamond coating for
erosion protection.

We are continually searching for new developments in surface
modification and materials.  Again, we welcome any input our
readers have on these subjects.  Please let us hear from you.

Modelling of Chemical Vapor Deposition

Researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New
Mexico, are working on the modelling of isothermal deposition in
single fiber bundles.  They believe this will aid in producing
high-quality ceramic-matrix composites.  A model has been developed
that takes into consideration the growth, and eventual overlap, of
deposition fronts about individual fibers.  In addition, a
mathematical model for woven fiber bundles has been developed.
With these models, the effects of changes in operating conditions
and weave architectures can be investigated through simulation.
Spatial variations in composite density can also be estimated.

New Thick- and Thin-film Coating Method

Through the use of supercritical fluids, researchers at the
University of Colorado in Boulder have developed a new method of
applying a variety of thin- and thick-film coatings.  The process
consists of mixing a coating compound with the supercritical fluid
and then spraying the mixture onto a heated surface where a
chemical reaction forms a stable coating.  Carbon dioxide or
nitrous oxide are the supercritical fluids used.  The mixture is
sprayed through a nozzle onto a heated surface.  The pressure and
temperature of the surface depend on the coating.  The ratios of
the metal precursors can be controlled somewhat precisely to form
films such as mixtures of metal oxides.

New Low-Temperature CVD Process for TiN Coatings

Injection molding dies for plastics is one of the leading
applications of a patented low-temperature CVD process developed by
Liburdi Engineering of Canada.  The lubricity of the TiN coating
improves plastic flow and reduces sticking during the injection
molding process.

The even coating of complex shapes, deep crevices, and runner
passages in the dies is a major advantage of this new method. In
addition, the low coating - temperature (500-650 Degree C)
maintains tool hardness and minimizes distortion which can occur
with conventional CVD at 1000 degree C.  No postcoating heat
treatment is needed.

The low coating-temperature is achieved by using a subchloride of
titanium, TiCl3, to produce the TiN.  The TiCl3 is made in the
reaction chamber by chlorination of Ti pellets in a reducing
atmosphere.  The coatings can be made more adherent as well as more
corrosion- or wear-resistant by controlling the gas flow rates, the
total pressure, and the chlorinator and coating temperatures.

Other applications for these adherent and wear-resistant coatings
are carbide inserts, stainless steel turbine compressor blades, and
dies used in metal forming operations.  An investigation to
establish correlations between coating parameters, composition,
structure, and properties is now going on with the objective of
improving the ability to tailor the coatings for specific
applications.  The company is interested in providing coating
services to the plastic-molding and metal-forming industries and
are also looking at joint development of new applications for these
TiN coatings.

Highway 6 North, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada L9J 1E7.  For coating
services information, contact Liburdi at 23565 Outwood Drive,
Southfield, MI 48034.

Jet Vapor Deposition Ready to Compete with CVD, PVD

Jet Process Corporation, New Haven, Connecticut, was started in
1984 by two Yale University graduates.  Co-founders Richard E. Hart
and Jerome J. Schmitt claim that the jet vapor process brings many
advantages to thin film deposition.  They include low cost, great
uniformity and high throughput.  Unlike CVD and PVD, jet vapor
works in a rough vacuum at low temperatures, and doesn't use toxic
gases.  The largest part of the JVD system is a standard,
fan-cooled mechanical pump.

An R&D model is expected to cost about half as much as other
deposition methods, according to Mr. Hart.  Right now, they are
working with a small group of companies and are acting as custom
fabricators.  It took four years to get the first JVD patent and an
R&D unit should be ready this year.  Production units may be
several years away.

In addition to CVD and PVD, the jet system may compete with e-beam
systems used for evaporation.  Compared to e-beams, JVD can operate
at much higher pressure, but in a low vacuum, and still produce
good results.  Mr. Schmitt added that since JVD doesn't need high
vacuums, it also doesn't require long pump down times.

JVD works with a mix of known principles of compressible gas
dynamics, fast flow systems, high temperature processes, plasma
chemistry and film deposition.  A supersonic jet flow of inert
carrier gas is formed by a nozzle.  This flow is directed into a
low vacuum chamber.  This chamber is continuously evacuated by a
high-speed mechanical pump.  Depositing vapor molecules are seeded
into the jet flow from a vapor source positioned within the nozzle.

Finally, the jet transports the vapor species to the prepared
substrate's surface, where a hard, dense, adherent coating is
formed.  This process is distinct from plasma spray methods where
droplets of molten metals or various ceramics are deposited.

The founders say that JVD offers important advantages for the
fabrication of integrated circuits and to the broad applications in
optics and aerospace.  Whether this process can obtain sufficient
market share from the current entrenched deposition methods remains
to be seen.

More on Lasers for Surface Modification

Several issues ago we featured the use of lasers for surface
treatment.  Although a small part of the overall picture at the
present time, this technology is expected to increase in volume in
the near future.

We were recently attracted to a discussion about laser chemical
vapor deposition. It is one way of depositing metals on substrates
and is being used in microelectronics packaging.  In a reaction
chamber containing gaseous precursors that are inert at room
temperatures, a focused laser beam is introduced to selectively
heat regions of the substrate.  Only in these heated regions will
the gaseous precursors react with each other.  The precursors are
carefully chosen so that the desired metal is the only solid
reaction product.

For packaging applications, some metals are of particular interest.

They include aluminum, copper, gold, and tungsten.
Tungsten is an attractive choice because it is compatible with many
other metals and dielectrics, does not corrode, and is
cost-efficient.

Even though laser CVD requires placing the workpiece in an
exhausted environment, as it usually involves hazardous gases, it
can be a cost-effective solution for some applications.  IBM, for
example, recently disclosed that it is using laser CVD of metals in
the manufacturing of its System/390 computers.  IBM researchers at
Almeden, California, had previously developed laser CVD processes
for several metals including gold.

Ceramic Coatings Possible for High Temperature Auto Parts

Automobile manufacturers are becoming more interested in using
thermal-barrier coatings (TBCs) on engine components that are
subjected to high exhaust temperatures, as well as excessively
abrasive conditions.  TBCs have been used for many years on
aircraft gas-turbine engine components.  Plasma-arc thermal
spraying is used to apply coatings of zirconium oxides containing
various stabilizers such as calcia, magnesia, yttria, ytterbia, and
ceria.

Diesel engine applications are very attractive to auto makers.
Zirconia TBCs offer many advantages including:

 Retaining heat in the combustion zone to improve efficiency.

 Reducing component surface temperature for protection from
 thermal shock and oxidation.

 Controlling heat loss to temperature-sensitive components.

 Providing improved wear-resistance.

Ceramic coatings can provide wear resistance, depending on the type
of mechanical loading involved.  Sliding wear, typically found in
valve stems and piston rings, requires a coating having  a low
coefficient of friction, such as aluminum, bronze or titanium
dioxide.  On the other hand, cam lobes and crankshafts need a
coating with a combination of high compressive strength and bond
strength, such as tungsten-carbide and chromium-carbide coatings.
The advent of higher exhaust-gas temperatures has led to research
of other types of ceramic coating methods.  A two-layer ceramic
coating for the inner passages of the ductile-iron exhaust
manifolds of diesel engines has been developed by researchers at
Hino Motors Ltd. and Hitachi Metals Ltd.  Coating is done by
passing a ceramic slurry containing a water glass binder through
the manifold.  Good adhesion between the iron substrate and the
coating is ensured by a layer of magnetite (2Fe0-Si02), which is
formed on the coating prior to coating.

The two-layer coating applied to the manifold is designed to
withstand cracking and peeling caused by the thermal shocks of
high-temperature exhaust gases. Testing of coated diesel-engine
manifolds confirms that oxidation is reduced and reliable operation
is obtained without cracking or peeling at temperatures to about
800 degree C.  But higher temperatures cause the coating to shrink.

This limits use of the coating to the temperature range experienced
by conventional, uncoated iron manifolds.  Coatings capable of
higher operating temperatures are needed if iron manifolds are to
compete successfully with stainless steel parts.

Additional research and development efforts are needed if auto
makers are to realize the protection from high temperatures
afforded by ceramic coatings.

Researchers Grow Diamond on Nickel Substrate

The epitaxial growth of diamond on a nickel substrate has been
accomplished by Japanese researchers at STA's National Institute
for Research in Inorganic Materials (NIRIM) and Onada Cement Co.,
Ltd.

The researchers used a nickel single-crystal substrate, over which
they circulated a 0.5 percent methane gas mixture at a temperature
of approximately 880 degree C.  This produced epitaxial growth of
diamond crystal on the substrate crystal and is claimed to be the
first hetero-epitaxial growth of diamond on a substrate material
other than cubic boron nitride.

According to both organizations, the researchers have yet to
produce a single-crystal film of diamond, but NIRIM confirmed that
epitaxial growth is indeed possible on a cobalt single-crystal
substrate.  In addition, reports indicate that a copper single-
crystal substrate may be used because of its suitable crystalline
structure.

Diamond Coating for Erosion Protection

The Science and Technology Center of Westinghouse Electric Corp.
has developed a diamond coating process for the protection of zinc
sulphide and zinc selenide soft windows, used in infrared sensors,
from erosion caused by rain, dust, or sand.

It should be noted that previous attempts to deposit diamond
directly onto optical surfaces have been unsuccessful due to
diamond's chemical and mechanical incompatibility with the
substrate material, and to the fuzzy image created by the
unevenness of the grown film surface.  The Westinghouse method
eliminates these problems by first depositing a diamond film onto
another material using microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor
deposition.  The diamond-coated material is embedded in a
chalcogenide glass bonding layer, and the glass is sandwiched
between the zinc compound and diamond film.  The outer surface,
which is the original substrate, is removed and exposes the diamond
nucleation surface.  The bonding process is independent of the
method used to deposit the diamond film. An immediate application
targeted for this process is the protection of infrared optics.
Quality optics in the visual range requires further work to reduce
a slight residual fuzziness caused by scattering, but visual image
distortion has been almost eliminated.  The company has filed for
a patent on its optical brazing technique.

Westinghouse researchers have coated windows up to about 40 mm (1.5
in.) in diameter.  Work on coating larger windows and curved
surfaces is under way.  The program is funded by the U.S. Naval
Weapons Center, China Lake, California, and Westinghouse.

According to the company, future applications could include
multispectral windows that pass both visual and IR wavelengths, for
missles and spacecraft, protection of photovoltaic cells in space,
shatterproof plastic eyeglasses, and scratch-free watch crystals
and mirrors.

For more information, contact Westinghouse Corp., Science and
Technology Center, 1310 Beulah Road, Pittsburg, PA 15235.
Corrosion-Resistant Carbon Steel for Producing Process Equipment

The Kemira Engineering Company of Finland has developed a technique
for bonding ordinary carbon steel and special metals together to
produce a fully corrosion-resistant coated steel.  The major
application for this kind of steel is the production of pressure
vessels and other types of process equipment.  The coating may be
a layer of acid-resistant or stainless steel, zirconium, titanium,
or tantalum.

The technique is called Chemface cladding.  Cost reductions of 30
to 50 percent are estimated over conventional designs using
expensive metals.  The company claims that the properties imparted
by this technique include absolute adhesion, vacuum integrity of
linings, and good mechanical strain resistance.

Depending on the temperature, the bond strength is estimated to be
ten to twenty times that needed for operation under vacuum.
Another application being considered for Chemface linings is the
replacement of vitreous enamel and other more conventional linings
to reduce maintenance costs.

Toyota Develops Material with Controlled Hardness

A material that can be stimulated by an external voltage to
increase its hardness without increasing its volume has been
developed by the Toyota Motor Company.  The new material is
composed of cobalt polymethacrylate particles dispersed in a matrix
of isoprene rubber.  When the external voltage is applied, the
binding forces between the entangled chains of particles increase,
reducing the elasticity of the chains and hardening the material.
There are no visible external changes and the volume of the
material remains constant.

The hardness of a 1 mm-thick film of this material can be adjusted
from 0.1 to 1.0 MPa.  Since the changes do not involve the
absorption or release of water, the material could be used in the
elctronic suppression of irregular vibrations in car engines and
bodies.

Research and Development Laboratories, 1 Toyota-CHO, Toyota City,

Zinc Coating On Site

Zinc coating can now be done on site without having to dismantle
structures, according to Galvatech Ltd. of the United Kingdom.
Described by the company as a "unique" anticorrosion product, Zinga
zinc coating can be applied by brush or spray.  It is a liquid
component which when dry contains at least 95 percent electrolytic
zinc that bonds to steel or iron, even if mildly rusted, to provide
maximum corrosion protection.

Zinga actually provides cathodic protection.  The zinc coating
rusts instead of the steel or iron base.  If the zinc coating is
scratched, the rust cannot creep under the coating and cause
bubbling.  Worn hot-dip galvanizing can be recoated.  It is not
necessary to dismantle structures like barriers, fencing or pylons.

Existing coatings of Zinga can be renewed and the new surface will
resemble its original condition.  There will be no separation
between the layers.  The company says that structures do not have
to be grit-blasted again after coating.  Mildly rusted structures
can be recoated without grit-blasting.

For more information contact Galvatech Ltd., 193 John St., London

INDUSTRY NEWS - Spire Corporation Announces First Quarter Sales and
Earnings

On May 14th, Roger G. Little, President and Chairman of the Board
of Spire Corporation, announced sales and revenues of $4,136,000
for the quarter ended March 31, 1991.  This compared to $4,836,000
recorded for the first quarter of 1990.  Results of operations
showed a profit of $1,000 or $0.00 per share, compared to net
earnings of $155,000 or $0.04 per share for the first quarter of
1990.

Mr. Little stated, "The decline in revenue that we experienced was
due primarily to reduced government R&D funding, principally
because of procurement delays.  This was anticipated.  We took
steps to cut nearly $2,000,000 per year in indirect expenses during
the latter half of 1990.  These cuts allowed us to break even for
the quarter with reduced revenues."

Mr. Little also said, "Our backlog has grown to $11 million.  We
have booked $5 million in new business since the beginning of 1991.

Included are major new government programs for optical component
and laser diode development as well as significant commercial
contracts.  With this increased backlog, we hope to be able to
improve quarterly revenues throughout the remainder of the year.
Improved revenues with continued cost containment could be
reflected in the Company's overall performance."

Spire produces unique epitaxial wafers, offers production ion
implantation processing services, and sells photovoltaic and
semiconductor processing equipment and related technology.  Spire's
customers span the biomedical, electronics, aerospace, defense and
energy industries worldwide.

Spire Wins Army Research Contract for Advanced Surface Texturing

In late May, Spire Corporation and the U.S. Army Materials
Technology Laboratory signed a $5 million research and development
contract, the largest in Spire's history.  It supports a three year
program to explore uses of SPI-TEXTTM surface texturing technology
for stray light suppression in advanced Army sensor systems.

Optical sensors are of vital importance to the next generation of
Army interceptors, designed to guard against ballistic missiles.
Since their mission requires extreme sensitivity and
discrimination, these sensor systems must have exceedingly dark
interior surfaces, or optical baffles, to achieve adequate stray
light rejection and pointing accuracy.  Baffle materials must
maintain their optical performance in the face of the shock loads
of interceptor launch and maneuver.  In addition, baffle materials
cannot introduce contamination which would compromise the sensor
system's signal-to-noise performance.

Today's commercially available baffle materials consist of either
black paints or acid-bath anodized metals.  The best baffle
materials have highly textured surfaces to create low reflectivity.
But these surfaces are fragile and easily damaged by incidental
contact during handling.  They also shed particles under flight
vibration.  A critical examination of failure mechanisms in current
materials suggested an innovative approach to producing superior
baffle materials.  Essentially, this approach is to texture the
metal surface directly, creating millions of light-trapping pores
and cones per square centimeter.

This leaves a sturdy metal surface without minute, fragile
interfaces subject to mechanical failure.

In an earlier research program with the Army Materials Technology
Lab, Spire developed SPI-TEXT ion beam texturing technology to
produce extremely dark surfaces which are immune to damage from
ordinary handling.  This program, sponsored by the U.S. Army
Strategic Defense Command and the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative
Organization, produced textured aluminum surfaces as dark as the
best commercial baffle materials without compromising mechanical
hardness.  In simulated launch vibration tests, this material
produced no detectable contamination on adjacent catcher plates.
Accoring to Dr. Edward A. Johnson, Spire program manager, "SPI-TEXT
offers a technological breakthrough to meet the stray light
suppression needs of advanced sensor systems."

Roger Little, President of Spire, said, "Spire is extremely proud
of the progress made to date in this important technology
development effort and of our contribution to the Army strategic
defense program.  We believe that our approach to hardened baffle
materials technology development has provided the Army with
substantially improved materials quickly and cost effectively.  We
are eager to continue our cooperation with the U.S. Army Materials
Technology Laboratory to develop advanced material solutions to
meet the stray light suppression requirements of present and future
Army strategic defense systems."

U.S. Navy Chooses American Cyanimide Aluminum Core

Aluminum honeycomb core from American Cyanimide in Wayne, N.J. has
been chosen by the Navy to replace the present core material
because of its superior corrosion resistance.  The honeycomb core
is phosphoric-acid anodized and primed.

Test samples were exposed to 100 percent relative humidity, and 6
to 8 percent salt spray at 140 degree F for a period of 30 days.
They were then subjetced to various kinds of damage such as dents,
cuts and holes that went through the core.  After being exposed for
an additional 60 days, they still showed no corrosion.

The PAA-Core is fabricated by laminating aluminum sheets and
expanding to form hexagonal cells.  With corrosion eliminated,
lighter structures are possible.  The end-results include extended
service life and reduction in repair costs and downtime.

Spray Deposition: A Fundamenatl Study of Droplet Impingement,
Spreading and Consolidation.

Prepared by D. Apelian, A. Lawley, and P. Mathur.  Drexel
University Department of Materials Engineering, Philadelphia, PA.

This report summarizes the objectives, approach and salient results
of a program on spray casting.  Spray casting via the Osprey<191>
process is emerging as a promising technology to produce
near-net-shaped components of advanced materials.  The process
involves the sequential stages of gas atomization and droplet
consolidation on a substrate to produce a disk, billet, tube,
and/or strip.  The major advantage of spray casting is the ability
to produce uniform, fine grained materials at deposition rates in
the range 0.25-2.5 kg/s in a single operation from the melt.
Composite materials can be manufactured by injecting second phase
particles into the spray of droplets, or by in-situ reactions
between the droplets and the gas during flight.  The objectives
were to develop a scientific understanding of the physical and
thermal phenomena that are active during spray casting and which
govern the shape and microstructural integrity of the preforms and
to evaluate the Osprey process for processing bulk high-strength
low-alloy steels.

invention available for U.S. licensing and, possibly, for foreign
licensing.  Copy of application available from NTIS.

This patent application provides a method of making a diamond thin
film that will be characterized by high thermal-conductivity, large
band-gap, and high electron-mobility, or the properties that are
desired for electronic devices.  A thin diamond film is prepared by
immersing a substrate in a liquid containing carbon and hydrogen
and then subjecting the substrate to at least one laser pulse.

Laser Assisted Cladding of Refractory Materials

Prepared by R.D. Creehan, Physical Sciences Inc., Andover, MA.

The objective of the study is to establish the feasibility of using
high-power lasers in a novel thermomechanical process for cladding
of high-melting substrate alloys without producing excessive
melting or thermal damage to the underlying substrate or cladding
foil.  By heating the interface of the clad material and substrate
alloy to the eutectic temperature of the binary alloy, a superior
metallurgical bond is produced with minimal melting and heating.
With the process, only a very narrow region of the clad-substrate
interface is actually fused and the clad surface retains a smooth
texture which does not require subsequent machining.  The coverage
rates which can be obtained with the process are one to two orders
of magnitude higher than reported in the literature for laser-
assisted fusion cladding processes in which the entire clad layer
is fused.

Chemical Cleaning of Aluminum Alloy Surfaces for Use as Vacuum
Materials in Synchrotron Light Sources

Prepared by N. Kaufherr, A. Krauss, D.M. Gruen, and R. Nielsen,
Argonne National Laboratory, IL

Photon and electron desorption from the vacuum chamber walls of
electron storage rings such as the proposed Advanced Photon Source
(APS), are sometimes responsible for the production of large gas
loads during operation even in systems with very good static
vacuum.  The gas released by beam-induced desorption results in
scattering of the beam electrons, and a consequent reduction in the
beam lifetime.  In extreme cases, the beam-induced outgassing may
cause so much scattering that it is not possible to obtain the
design goals with regard to obtainable beam current.  Consequently,
it is important that the surfaces which are exposed to the electron
beam and photon fluxes contain as little trapped gas as possible,
and that the gas burden during operation be kept as low as
possible.  The current study investigates the effectiveness of a
chemical cleaning tratment developed at CERN for the LEP storage
ring, as applied to the 6063 alloy to be used in APS.
Additionally, depth profiling of the chemically cleaned samples and
samples which were vapor-degreased only, provides new insight on
the cleaning process as it applies to the alloy proposed for use in
APS.  14 refs., 8 figures.
