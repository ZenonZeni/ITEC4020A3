NASA Working on
Chelation Follow Up

NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Pasadena, CA) has proposed a
method of quantitative analysis for metal-ion contaminants in solid
and aqueous environmental samples.  The metal ions would first be
chelated, then extracted from the samples and carried through a
suitable restrictor to a gas-chromatograph/mass-spectrometer (GC-
MS) by using a suitable supercritical fluid.

When fully developed, the method might be implemented in a field-
portable apparatus for the detection and quantification of metals
in various matrices without a need for elaborate preparation of
samples.  The apparatus could be used, for example, to analyze soil
samples for toxic metals.

A GC-MS apparatus could be used to analyze samples of soil for
organic materials, but not for metals. Traditionally there was no
way to extract the metals form soil samples and present the metals
to the mass spectrometer in the required gaseous form.  It would be
quite cost effective if both metals and organic compounds could be
analyzed by the same technique of mass spectrometry.

The key step in the proposed technique would be the chelation,
which would convert the metal from an ionic form that is
essentially insoluble in a typical supercritical fluid to a
chelated form that is soluble in a supercritical fluid.  Because
metal chelates extracted via a supercritical fluid are effectively
in the gaseous state, they can be introduced directly into a mass
spectrometer for analysis.

On the basis of their demonstrated ability to form metal chelates,
8-hydroxy-quinoline, acetyl acetone, dialkyldithio-carbamates, and
ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) have been selected for
investigation of their suitability as chelating agents in the
proposed technique.  The investigation will also address the use of
tetralkyl ammonium ions to increase the solubilities of metal
complexes.

The work was done by Mahadeva P. Sinha of Caltech for NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.  The invention is owned by NASA, and a
patent application has been filed.  Inquiries concerning non-
exclusive or exclusive license for its commercial development
should b addressed to the patent counsel, NASA Resident Office-JPL;

Bayer Looks Into
Biocatalytic Synthesis

Enzymes are known for their ability to selectively catalyze
reactions in both aqueous and non-aqueous media. There is a growing
interest in the biocatalytic synthesis of specialty polymers since
such an approach can generate additional properties such as
chirality and biodegradability.  Biologically synthesized polymers
have been applied as absorbents, biodegradable materials, chiral
adsorbents, liquid crystals, and perm-selective membranes.

Bayer Corp. (1 Mellon Bank Ctr., Pittsburgh, PA 15258; Tel:
412/394-5500, Fax: 412/394-5534) has discovered a process for the
production of polyesters reacting a diol with an acid or acid ester
in the presence of a solid enzymes and supercritical fluids (US
Patent 5,478,910).

Low molecular weight linear aliphatic oligoesters that are hydroxy
terminated have commercial significance for use in the manufacture
of polyurethane resins. The current commercial process is based on
acid/base catalyzed condensation polymerization between a
diacid/diester and a diol. The use of traditional catalysts is
limited because such catalysts tend to have an undesirable effect
on the subsequent polyurethane synthesis.

Supercritical fluids have been described as extraction solvents,
have been used in various industrial extraction processes, and have
been suggested as being useful for a variety of enzyme catalyzed
reactions. With supercritical fluids as the reaction medium, enzyme
enantioselectivity can be manipulated by the pressure of the
system.

In both enzymatic and non-enzyme catalyzed synthesis of oligoesters
and polyesters, it is difficult to control product molecular weight
in a predictable manner. All techniques described to date depend
upon changing the reaction time in order to manipulate molecular
weight. In the case of non-enzyme catalyzed oligo- and polyesters,
the final product typically contains cyclic ester by-products and
small amounts of residual catalyst, both of which can adversely
affect properties of products produced from those oligo- and
polyesters.

The Bayer innovation overcomes most of the above difficulties and
allows for the production of a wide variety of polyesters where it
is relatively simple to produce a material of a desired molecular
weight by merely varying the pressure under which the
polyesterification or polytransesterification reaction is
conducted.

Pesticides Removed
from Fruits, Veggies

Two recent publications describe the removal of pesticides from
vegetables and fruits using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE).
Both studies found SFE an acceptable method for the removal of
pesticides from produce for analysis.

Steven J. Lehotay and Konstantin I. Eller of the Beltsville
Agricultural Research Center of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(Environmental Chemistry Laboratory, Bldg. 7, Rm. 224, Beltsville,
MD 20705-2351; Tel: 301/504-6078) developed a method for analyzing
the levels of 46 pesticides in grapes, carrots, potatoes, and
brocolli.  The multiresidue method used SFE in conjunction with gas
chromatography/ion-trap mass spectrometry in order to extract and
analyze residues.

The SFE was performed at 320 atm and 60oC, and the extracts were
trapped on solid-phase media.  Silica gel bound to octadecylsilane
was found suitable for this purpose.  The trap was then eluted with
acetonitrile.  Next, the chromatographic analysis was performed.
Greater than 80% recoveries were achieved for 39 of the 46
pesticides.  The recoveries of the other pesticides, with the
exception of methamidophos and omethoate, were more than 50%.

Both incurred and fortified samples were used in a subsequent
analysis to evaluate the method.  The blind experiment showed that
this method resulted in recoveries similar to results from seven
laboratories using solvent-based extractions with traditional gas-
chromatograph detectors.

Lehotay tells HTSN that the focus of his work is pesticide analysis
of agricultural commodities, and SFE is one of the primary methods
of extraction being developed by the laboratory.  The study was
published as "Development of a Method of Analysis for 46 Pesticides
in Fruits and Vegetables by Supercritical Fluid Extraction and Gas
Chromatography/Ion Trap Mass Spectrometry" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3), 821-830,
1995].

In a similar study, scientists in Spain used a simple SFE method to
remove pesticide residues from fresh pepper, cucumber, and tomato
samples.  Under moderate conditions, commercial SFE equipment
extracted methamidophos at a level greater than 70%, as well as
chlorpyrifos, endosulfan, and procymidone.

The fresh samples were mixed with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
Methanol was used as a modifier for the carbon dioxide fluid.
Extraction conditions were a pressure of 300 atm and a temperature
of 50C.  The authors recommend further development of this method
for the extraction of multiple residues.

A. Garcia-Valverde, A.R. Fernandez-Alba, A. Aguera, and M.
Contreras of the Pesticide Residue Research Group of the
Universidad de Almeria (Facultad de Ciencias Experimentales, Spain)
published "Extraction of Methamidophos Residues from Vegetables
with Supercritical Fluid Carbon Dioxide" in the Journal of the
Association of Official Analytical Chemistry [78(3), 867-873,
1995].

Synthetic Proteins
Behave Like BABS

Creative BioMolecules Inc. (35 South St., Hopkinton, MA; Tel:
508/435-9001) has been issued a patent for the development of a
family of synthetic proteins that have affinity for a preselected
antigen (U.S. No. 5,476,786). The Creative BioMolecules proteins
are characterized by one or more sequences of amino acids
constituting a region that behaves as a biosynthetic antibody
binding site (BABS). The sites comprise:

     non-covalently associated or disulfide bonded synthetic VH and
VL dimers,

     VH-VL or VL-VH single chains wherein the VH and VL are
attached by a polypeptide linker, or

     Individual VH or VL domains.

Antibodies are proteins belonging to a group of immunoglobulins
elicited by the immune system in response to a specific antigen or
substance that the body deems foreign. Antibodies can both
recognize and bind that antigen and are involved in a number of
effector reactions such as complement fixation and allergic
responses.

There are five classes of human antibodies that have the ability to
selectively recognize and preferentially bind a specific antigen.
Each antibody class has the same basic structure, or multiples
thereof, consisting of two identical polypeptides called heavy or
H chains (molecular weight in IgG approximately 50,000 d each) and
two identical polypeptides called light or L chains (molecular
weight approximately 25,000 d each).

Each of the five antibody classes has a similar set of light chains
and a distinct set of heavy chains. A light chain is composed of
one variable and one constant domain, while a heavy chain is
composed of one variable and three or more constant domains. The
variable domains determine the specificity of the immunoglobulin,
and the constant regions have other functions.

Amino acid sequence data indicate that each variable domain
comprises three hypervariable regions flanked by four relatively
conserved framework regions. The hypervariable regions have been
assumed to be responsible for the binding specificity of individual
antibodies and to account for the diversity of binding of
antibodies as a protein class.

Monoclonal antibodies, or homogeneous antibodies of identical
genetic parentage and binding specificity, have been useful both as
diagnostic and therapeutic agents. They are routinely produced
according to established procedures by hybridomas generated by
fusion of mouse lymphoid cells with an appropriate mouse myeloma
cell line.

Human monoclonal antibodies are difficult to produce by cell-fusion
techniques since, among other problems, human hybridomas are
notably unstable, and removal of immunized spleen cells from humans
is not feasible as it is for rodents. Monoclonals, which have
specificities of significant therapeutic value, are generally of
murine or rat origin, and are therefore immunogenic to the human
immune system.

The binding domains comprise linked CDR and FR regions, which may
be derived from separate immunoglobulins. The proteins may also
include other polypeptide sequences that function as an enzyme,
toxin, binding site, or site of attachment to an immobilization
media or radioactive atom. Methods are disclosed for producing the
proteins, for designing BABS having any specificity that can be
elicited by in vivo generation of antibody, and for producing
analogs thereof.

SELEX Method
Prepares Ligands

Larry Gold and Diane Tasset of Nextstar Pharmaceuticals Inc.
(Boulder, CO) have determined methods to identify nucleic acid
ligand solutions to thrombin (US Patent 5,476,766).  The invention
utilizes the SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands for EXponential
enrichment) method for identifying and preparing RNA ligands to
thrombin.  Included are modified nucleotide sequences based on the
sequences of the RNA ligands identified. The modified RNA ligands
to thrombin exhibit increased in vivo stability.

Most proteins or small molecules are not known to specifically bind
to nucleic acids. The known protein exceptions are those regulatory
proteins such as repressors, polymerases, activators, and the like
that function in a living cell to bring about the transfer of
genetic information encoded in the nucleic acids into cellular
structures and the replication of the genetic material. Small
molecules such as GTP bind to some intron RNAs.

The individual components of proteins, the 20 natural amino acids,
possess sufficient chemical differences and activities to provide
an enormous breadth of activities for both binding and catalysis.
Nucleic acids, however, are thought to have narrower chemical
possibilities than proteins, but to have an informational role that
allows genetic information to be passed from virus to virus, cell
to cell, and organism to organism. In this context nucleic acid
components, the nucleotides, possess only pairs of surfaces that
allow informational redundancy within a Watson-Crick base pair.
Nucleic acid components need not possess chemical differences and
activities sufficient for either a wide range of binding or
catalysis.

Some nucleic acids found in nature do participate in binding to
certain target molecules and even a few instances of catalysis have
been reported. The range of activities of this kind is narrow
compared to proteins and more specifically antibodies.  Double-
stranded DNA has a well-known capacity to bind within the nooks and
crannies of target proteins whose functions are directed to DNA
binding. Single-stranded DNA can also bind to some proteins with
high affinity and specificity, although the number of examples is
smaller.

While not bound by a theory of preparation, systematic evolution of
ligands for exponential enrichment (SELEX) is based on the
inventors' insight that within a nucleic acid mixture containing a
large number of possible sequences and structures, there is a range
of binding affinities for a given target. A nucleic acid mixture
comprising, for example, a 20 nucleotide randomized segment can
have 420 candidate possibilities. Those that have the higher
affinity constants for the target are most likely to bind.

After partitioning, dissociation, and amplification, a second
nucleic acid mixture is generated, enriched for the higher binding
affinity candidates. Additional rounds of selection progressively
favor the best ligands until the resulting nucleic acid mixture is
predominantly composed of only one or a few sequences. These can be
cloned, sequenced, and individually tested for binding affinity as
pure ligands.

In many cases, it is not necessarily desirable to perform the
iterative steps of SELEX until a single nucleic acid ligand is
identified. The target-specific nucleic acid ligand solution may
include a family of nucleic acid structures or motifs that have a
number of conserved sequences and a number of sequences that can be
substituted or added without significantly effecting the affinity
of the nucleic acid ligands to the target. By terminating the SELEX
process prior to completion, it is possible to determine the
sequence of a number of members of the nucleic acid ligand solution
family.

Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease that has important
procoagulant and anticoagulant activities. As a procoagulant
enzyme, thrombin clots fibrinogen, activates clotting factors V,
VIII, and XIII, and activates platelets. The specific cleavage of
fibrinogen by thrombin initiates the polymerization of fibrin
monomers, a primary event in blood clot formation. The central
event in the formation of platelet thrombi is the activation of
platelets from the "pnonbinding"n to the "sbinding"d mode, and
thrombin is the most potent physiologic activator of platelet
aggregation.

As a procoagulant, thrombin plays a key role in the arrest of
bleeding (physiologic hemostasis) and formation of vasoocclusive
thrombi (pathologic thrombosis).  The formation of the thrombin-TM
complex converts thrombin from a procoagulant to an anticoagulant
enzyme, and the normal balance between these opposing activities is
critical to the regulation of hemostasis.

Chemical Sensor
Detects Reactions

Fisons plc (Ipswich, UK) and GEC Marfoni Ltd. (Ipswich, UK)  have
developed chemical sensors for detecting antibody-antigen binding
reactions (US Patent 5,478,756). The sensor is characterized in
that the surface of the piezoelectric support, including the region
bearing the electrode, is covered by a layer of dielectric material
of thickness 0.5 to 20 microns. The piezoelectric support is
preferably a single crystal. The dielectric layer may be of silicon
dioxide or a suitable polymer and preferably has a thickness of
between 0.5 and 5 microns.

Antibodies are molecules that protect an organism from disease
and/or infection. When an organism is exposed to an antigen, the
organism creates antibodies that provide binding sites to which the
antigen may be bound and immobilized.

Many known antibodies exist and can be used to detect specific
antigens. Detection of such antigens is effected by providing the
appropriate antibody and determining whether binding takes place.
For example, an antibody may be provided on a surface of a support,
the support may be immersed in a liquid thought to contain an
antigen, and a physical characteristic of the surface and/or the
support is monitored to determine if binding (indicative of the
presence of the antigen) has taken place.

One form of support that has been used is a piezo-electric crystal
in which surface acoustic waves (SAW) are generated. Binding of
antigen to antibody on the surface of the support is detected as a
decrease in wave velocity.

A problem that occurs with known SAW sensors is that considerable
penetration occurs if the acoustic wave into the environment is to
be sensed. If the environment is gaseous, this problem is not
unduly onerous. However, if (as is usually the case for analysis of
biologically originating samples) the environment is liquid, then
the penetration of the wave into the environment causes
considerable damping. This in turn reduces the sensitivity of the
device.

Devices have also been described that utilize shear horizontal
waves. These offer a number of advantages over SAW devices: 1) bulk
waves suffer lower propagation losses than SAW (under liquids); 2)
bulk waves have higher velocities and can therefore be used at
higher frequencies than SAW; and 3) bulk waves have superior
temperature coefficients to SAW in both quartz and LiTaO3. These
bulk wave devices suffer from the disadvantage of a limited mass
sensitivity due to poor surface energy confinement.

The new invention is an improved form of chemical sensor of
particular utility in the detection and/or determination of an
analyte species in a sample that is liquid, as is generally the
case for samples of biological origin, and that overcomes or
substantially mitigates the disadvantages associated with known SAW
and bulk wave devices.  The sensor is advantageous in that the
layer of dielectric material increases the coupling coefficient and
reduces the insertion loss of the wave. Also, and very importantly,
the device may be totally immersed in a liquid with little
attenuation occurring in the intensity of the guided surface wave.

Other advantages of the sensor according to the invention include
its relatively simple construction and the fact that the whole
surface of the device may be used for sensing, which increases the
sensitivity. The dielectric layer may also reduce the temperature
coefficient of delay. Further, by appropriate choice of dielectric
material, e.g. derivatized silica, the need for an adhesion layer
for the immobilization of reagents on the surface can be
eliminated.

The device, according to the invention, is conveniently a two-port
waveguide sensor having spaced-apart input and output electrodes.
Alternatively, the device may be a one-port resonator having a
single electrode with a reflective metallic grating on either side.
The gratings reflect the acoustic waves, a resonant cavity being
formed between the gratings. Also, the gratings affect mass loading
of the surface. For this latter purpose, a grating may be included
in the two-port device, between the input and output electrodes.

In use, the device is immersed in a liquid to be tested, or a drop
of liquid is applied to the surface of the layer of silicon
dioxide. If the liquid contains the species that binds with the
reagent immobilized on the surface of the layer, a change in mass
occurs at that surface. This slows the acoustic wave and alters the
phase of the output signal. The change in phase provides a
quantitative indication of the presence of the analyte in the
sample.

New Modified Laser
Fluorometric Detector

In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in capillary
electrophoresis (CE) for separations of a wide variety of
compounds.  The high efficiencies that can be obtained for most
separations are very beneficial and can alleviate some difficulties
associated with the separation of complex samples. Brian Clark and
Michael Sepaniak of the University of Tennessee (Dept. of
Chemistry, Knoxville, TN 37996-1600) published information on the
development and evaluation of modified capillary electrophoresis
instrumentation with laser fluorometric detection. This allows for
the convenient and precise translation of the detection zone along
the length of the separation column, according to the Journal of
Microcolumn Separations  [7(6), 593-601, 1995].

There are several anomalies that can limit efficiency and, hence,
resolution in CE.  Among these are anomalous effects associated
with electroosmotic flow, sample injection, temperature gradients,
and non-uniform field phenomena.  Investigations of the
aforementioned anomalies are difficult because detection is
commonly performed at a single detection point.  Many events that
can have a profound impact on the separation process and occur
prior to detection cannot be accurately studied.

There have been several attempts to develop instrumentation capable
of multi-point interrogation of separation systems.  Most involve
a high level of instrumental complexity and high cost due to the
use of several detectors in series. The development of a cost-
effective, experimentally simple device could benefit many
fundamental studies in CE, as well as address certain practical
problems associated with optimizing the signal/noise ratio and
minimizing separation time.

The newly developed instrumentation is used for fundamental studies
of band dispersion, analyte mobility alterations, sample stacking,
and the determination of diffusion coefficients.  The feasibility
of using this instrumentation to improve the signal/noise ratio and
decrease analysis time is presented.  DNA restriction digest
separations employing soluble polymer buffer systems with on-column
fluorescent labeling was used to illustrate the unique advantages
of this experimental design.

Continuous Separation
of Solids, Liquids

For the continuous separation of liquids and solids, TEMA has a
unique centrifuge called the Conturbex.  The Conturbex can handle
flow rates that range from 6 gpm to 440 gpm.  They also have a
solids-discharge capacity of up to 132,000 pounds per hour.  This
machine is capable of generating forces of more than 2,000 g's.
The Conturbex is used for particles in the 60 micron and above
range. Tema Systems (7806 Redsky Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45249-1632;
Tel: 513/489-7811, Fax: 513/489-4817) manufactures and services the
complete line of horizontal axis continuous centrifuges.

Tema also manufactures a Decanter centrifuge for particles in the
5-100 micron range, and on particles with a different specific
gravity than the mother liquid.  The Pusher centrifuge is used for
applications where a high amount of product washing is desired.
While the Conturbex also offers product washing, the Pusher
provides the highest amount of washing effect available in a
continuous centrifuge.

For applications that de-water very well, the Turbo-Cascade
sliding-discharge centrifuge is used.  This centrifuge works well
on particles of uniform size and will accommodate solids of
approximately 0.5 mm and larger.

Tema Systems is the exclusive North American manufacturer for
Siebtechnik design centrifuges.  Siebtechnik GmbH has been a
leading European manufacturer for more than 60 years.

Isothermal Method
Separates Zeolite Y

The changes in component concentrations in the liquid phase are
important for the nucleation and crystal growth of zeolite species
and have been reported by several researchers.  The greatest
portion of the liquid phase in the initial reaction mixture for
zeolites X and Y is involved in the gel phase, and the separable
amount of the liquid phase is significantly smaller than that from
the well-crystallized one.

Akira Yoshida of the Kyushu National Industrial Research Institute
(Inorganic Materials Dept., Shuku-machi, Tosu-shi, Saga-ken 841
Japan) has undertaken an analysis of the liquid phase during the
course of crystallization of zeolite Y using an isothermal
centrifugal separation technique.  Results of the study have been
published in Zeolites [15, 739-744, 1995].

Yoshida examined the concentrations of components in the liquid
phase during the course of crystallization using a centrifugal
reaction tube with an intermediate filter plate.  Using these
concentration data and the amount of dissoluble species from the
solid portion by washing, the component concentrations in the
nearest liquid layer to the surface of the solid portion were
estimated, and the amount of Na+ ions at the dangling bonds of
silicate structure were evaluated.

The first filtrate, which must have similar component
concentrations in the liquid phase obtained by the usual
filtration, has lower concentrations of silica and Na+ ions, and
consequently, a lower specific gravity than those in the other
filtrates.  The weight ratios of silica and sodium ions and the
Na/Si molar ratios in the second, third, and fourth filtrates were
nearly the same.

The Na/Si molar ratios in the nearest liquid layer was
conspicuously higher than those in the filtrates because of the
dissolution of Na+ ions from dangling bonds of the aluminosilicate
framework.  The washed solid portion also had excess Na+ ions.
These excess Na+ ions at the surface of growing crystals and
amorphous precursor decreased linearly with the increasing
crystallinity.

Westinghouse Isolates
Erbium Isotopes

A continuous, steady-state chromatography process for the
simultaneous separation of isotopes of erbium (Er) has been
prepared by scientists at Westinghouse Electric Corp. (Stanwix St.,
Pittsburgh, PA 15222; Tel: 412/244-2000).  Thomas S. Snyder reports
that an ion-exchange resin serves as the stationary phase, an
aqueous solution of ions based on a mixture of Er isotopes is the
feed phase, and an aqueous acid eluant solution is the mobile
phase.  The process involves the mobile-phase eluting or desorbing
the Er isotope solute adsorbed on the stationary phase under
conditions such that each of the naturally occurring isotopes of Er
is eluted in a distinct volume.

Er is used in nuclear fuel assembly designs as burnable poison with
a high neutron capture cross section.  Its overall characteristics
are comparable to those of boron.  Er's chemical properties are
similar to those of gadolinium (Gd) except that Er(III) is a
slightly more acidic ion than Gd(III) in solution.  As a result,
its separation chemistry should be more powerful than that of Gd in
similar eluents.

The key issue in the design of a system for Er isotopic enrichment
chemistry is that the important fractions of the high cross section
isotopes are embedded in undesirable isotopes.  This requires
multiple extraction trains when using separations technologies such
as solvent extraction or fixed-bed ion-exchange columns, which
produce "heads" and "tails" fractions but nothing in the "middle."


As a result, multiple trains are required to dissect the fractions
until the desired head or tail emerges from the column as the sole
constituent of the product fraction.  This enrichment problem,
coupled with the requirement for complex chemistry and hardware to
separate Er from ores, leads to several issues that must be
addressed by a process technology capable of recovering Er from raw
ore and refining it to an isotopically pure product for use in
nuclear fuel assembly design.

The separation of Er from other rare earth elements and impurities
in the ore leachate requires a large number of multistage
extraction circuits because of the relatively low specificity of
the distribution coefficients for most extraction solvents.  A
large number of large, awkward, and expensive stages per extraction
unit are required, and hazardous mixed wastes are generated as a
result of the organic solvents.  Peripheral purification operations
are also required to refine the Er and prepare it for isotopic
enrichment.

The new Westinghouse process uses a continuous annular
chromatograph.  Erbium oxide dissolved in an aqueous mineral acid
is fed to the chromatograph.  The stationary phase is a cation-
exchange resin, and the mobile phase is normally aqueous
hydrochloric acid.  Chelants, complexants or ligands may be added
to enhance the separation.  U.S. Patent 5,437,795 covers the
Westinghouse invention.

New Process
Purifies FDP

Anion-exchange chromatography can be used to purify fructose 1,6-
diphosphate (FDP), according to researchers at Unitika Ltd. (4-1-3
Kyutaro-Machi, Chuo-Ku, Osaka 541, Japan; Tel: 6-281-5712, Fax: 6-
281-5563).  After desalting, the resultant FDP is used in
pharmaceuticals, reports Tatsuo Katayama.

Several processes exist for the production of FDP.  One involves
its synthesis from glucose and phosphoric acid through the
fermentation of yeast cells.  Another technique uses glucose in the
presence of acetate kinase-containing cells or extracts, and acetyl
phosphate.  Additional purification is required to produce a
product of pharmaceutical-grade quality.

Although cation-exchange chromatography may be used, such a process
makes the FDP solution acidic.  Proteinous materials contained as
impurities in the solution are denatured and precipitated, and the
precipitate obstructs the passage of the FDP through the cation-
exchange column.  One alternative is to remove the proteinous
impurities from the FDP solution prior to the cation-exchange
treatment using heat or a hydrochloric acid-based technique.  The
problem with this approach is that during this pretreatment step
some of the FDP is also denatured and lost, reducing the final FDP
yield.

The Unitika scientists improved FDP yields by using anion-exchange
chromatography and a subsequent desalting separation such as
electrodialysis (ED) or reverse osmosis (RO). Suitable ED membranes
are manufactured from hydrocarbon-based, fluorine-containing  high
polymer materials.  Polyamides are normally used for the RO
membranes.  U.S. Patent 5,434,255 further details the Unitika work.

Large-Scale Method
Purifies Proteins

Advantages of immobilized metal affinity chromatography or IMAC
include the optimal control of ligand density.  Binding sites are
energetically homogeneous with respect to each adsorbing species,
and selectivity is high, producing 3000-fold purification in a
single step.  The separation of proteins can be achieved with
minimum denaturation, it is relatively easy to maintain sterile
conditions during operation, and solvents are cheap and
environmentally friendly.

Large-scale immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC)
techniques intended for the purification of proteins and peptides
were devised by scientists at Purdue University (School of Chemical
Engineering, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1283; Tel: 317/494-4050).
Kamran Khan, Zidu Ma, Segal Patel, and N. H. Linda Wang report that
the research team determined the adsorption isotherms of imidazole,
His-Ala dipeptide, chicken egg-white lysozyme, and horse heart
myoglobin using single- and multiple-step frontal chromatography.

Protein adsorption in IMAC is a complicated process involving a
series of steric, chemical, kinetic, and thermodynamic variables.
It can be further complicated by multi-site binding and
heterogeneity in binding.  One of the more important quantities
needed for competition studies and understanding of the dynamic
adsorption behavior is the equilibrium adsorption isotherm.

Breakthrough curves under column overload conditions in high-
performance liquid chromatography can be used to obtain the
isotherm information.  Although direct measurement of the
competition between adsorbed molecules is complicated in IMAC
systems, studies on the maximum capacity of a protein in the
presence of imidazole at a constant concentration can provide
information on the competition as well as simplify data analysis.

In the Purdue research, the capacity for copper, or Cu(II), ions
was quantified.  Imadazole isotherm measurements were determined
for metal-charged and metal-free columns, and dipeptide isotherms
were measured.  The Purdue scientists described their work at the
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) 1995 Annual
Meeting in Miami Beach, FL.

Multipurpose Device
Combines Operations

A multipurpose laboratory electrophoresis device built by Sumeet
and Kuldeep Verma (3509 Crofton Court, Raleigh, NC 27604; Tel:
919/878-6625) is said to combine several procedures in the same
apparatus, eliminating the need for moving a gel between analytic
jobs.  Electrophoresis, horizontal and vertical electroblotting
and/or electroelution, vacuum blotting, capillary blotting,
ultraviolet (UV) observation of ethidium bromide labeled specimens,
UV photography, and UV crosslinking may all be performed.  Features
of the apparatus include buffer circulation, light opaque
enclosure, DNA band compaction, and DNA elution without cutting the
DNA band.

Gel electrophoresis remains a key analytical tool in molecular
biology and clinical sciences.  The electrophoresis of DNA and
other organic molecules under the influence of an electric field
involves the casting of a semisolid gel of agarose or
polyacrylamide in a mold to produce a thin, rectangular slab.
Wells, or depressions, are formed in the upper surface of the slab
along a line at one end.  The gel slab is placed in chamber with
electrodes at each end, and the chamber is filled with a buffer
solution to a level higher than the gel.  Some wells are filled
with a solution containing the sample, and a high-gradient electric
field is applied to the gel through the buffer solution.  The
molecules in the sample separate into bands by migrating through
the gel slab toward the oppositely charged electrodes at different
rates depending on their mobility, a function of molecular charge
density and size.

Gels are fragile.  Manipulation can rip or distort them, resulting
in unreliable test results.  The usefulness of electrophoresis
depends on producing thin, well-defined molecular sample bands.
Such definition depends partially on the manner in which the
molecular sample migrates from the sample well along the gel.

The sample well, the distribution of the sample in the well, and
the electric field influence band definition.  A sample once
deposited in a well migrates horizontally through the gel as a
vertically oriented rectangle.  The sides of the sample rectangle
tend to migrate slower than the central portion, resulting in a U-
shaped dispersed band.  A macromolecular sample deposited in the
front corner of the well migrates horizontally as a compact line
through a comparatively small volume of gel, resulting in narrow,
straight, well-defined bands.  An operator must exercise extreme
care in loading the sample to obtain a well-defined band.  The
problem is that, despite such care, electrophoretic results are
often diminished by the presence of U-shaped, dispersed,
macromolecular sample bands.

The new device, fully described in U.S. Patent 5,449,446, is a
single, integrated apparatus capable of the execution of molecular
separation in a gel, subsequent molecular transfer to a membrane,
and photography of the results.  The unit includes a power source,
an electrophoresis-electroblot-transilluminator, a viewing hood, a
camera hood, and UV-radiation sources for sample detection and
crosslinking.

The unit can horizontally separate sample molecules within a gel
and the subsequent vertical or horizontal transfer of the molecules
to an adjacent membrane by electroblotting, capillary-blotting, or
vacuum-blotting techniques.  The UV-radiation source irradiates the
gel to cause fluorescence of the sample.  The UV-radiation source
crosslinks the separated sample to the membrane.

Assay Offers In
Vitro Evaluation

The gel mobility shift assay is a useful tool for rapid and
economical evaluation of chemicals in vitro for DNA-damaging or
promoter effects.  The Molecular Toxicology Group at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory has investigated the risks of human exposure to
radiation and chemicals using the newest molecular biology-based
procedures.  The group identifies new biomarkers, designs and
evaluates new in vitro assays.

Advances in the molecular biology of cancer are providing a unique
opportunity to design more reliable assays to evaluate human health
risks.  These assays can provide rapid, economical, and reliable
evaluation of the potential carcinogenicity of genotoxic and non-
genotoxic chemicals.

DNA-damaging and cancer chemotherapeutic agents increase p53-DNA
site-specific finding in treated cells.  The Oak Ridge scientists
conducted p53-gel mobility shift assays on NOVEX (11040 Roselle
St., San Diego, CA 92121-1222; Tel: 800/456-6839 or 619/452-6634,
Fax: 619/452-6635) 6% DNA Retardation Gels to identify chemicals
that damage DNA or affect enzymes that modify DNA.  Cells are
treated with a suspected DNA-damaging agent for a short time (two
to four hours).  The cells are lysed and extracts containing p53
are incubated with the [32P]-end labeled p53 consensus binding
sequence.  Gel mobility shift assays are performed on NOVEX 6% DNA
retardation gels with 1/2x TBE as the running buffer.

Chemicals that mimic estrogen's growth-stimulating activities have
been called environmental estrogens or xenoestrogens.  Estrogen-
like promoters can be identified using gel-mobility shift assays.
For example, pesticides, dyes, and pollutants increase binding of
the estrogen receptor (ER) to the estrogen response element (ERE).
The ER-ERE complexes were separated by electrophoresis on a NOVEX
6% DNA retardation gel.  Human breast cells treated with estrogen
or DDT show increased amounts of ER complexed to the ERE;
therefore, gel-mobility shift assays performed on NOVEX pre-cast
gels can rapidly identify potential environmental estrogens.

The use of NOVEX pre-cast gels for these procedures simplifies the
assay, makes them more user friendly, and decreases the time
required to perform them.

Pall Changes
IV Concept

A new concept in intravenous (IV) fluid filtration has been
developed by Pall Biomedical Products Co. (25 Harbor Park Drive,
Port Washington, NY 11050; Tel: 516/484-3600, Fax: 516/484-3637, E-
mail: custsvc@pall.com).  The Pall DUO96 Set Save Extended Life
Disposable Filter incorporates a new dual-chamber design that is
for use with intermittent medications in oncology and intensive
care.  The smaller chamber (0.5cc) is ideal for fluid-restricted
patients such as neonates.

In addition to its clinical benefits, the DUO96 filter provides
cost savings.  When the Pall IV filter is used, the interval for
routine IV set change can be extended up to 96 hours, resulting in
a reduction in set use and costs.  Nursing time associated with
intravenous administration (set changes, restarts, and problem
resolution) is also reduced.

The DUO96 filter contains a Posidyne 0.2 micron Nylon 66 membrane,
a hydrophilic filter medium that is easily wetted and easily
primed.  Position insensitive hydrophobic membranes automatically
vent air.

Osmonics Holding
More of the Dirt

Increased dirt-holding capacity (DHC) or contaminant loading of
filters has been a continuous goal of filter manufacturers and a
continuous desire of filter users.  This is because increased DHC
results in more economical filtration.  However, it is difficult to
achieve higher DHC without compromising the efficiency of the
filter.

Most filter manufacturers have devised increasing DHC by improving
the filter media.  The amount any filter medium can hold is
directly proportional to the void volume or open area in the media.
Over the years, millions of dollars have been spent on developing
media that will hold more contaminant.  It is a difficult task
because in any given medium, if you increase the void volume, you
decrease contaminant-removal efficiency.

To increase DNC without compromising removal efficiency,
manufacturers have altered the structure of the media.  Despite
using finer fibers, greater loft, more entanglement, and multiple
layers, or by forming asymmetric pores and creating greater pore
density, filter media manufacturers have been able to achieve only
modest increases in DNC.

Spiraltek rolled-cartridge filters from Osmonics (5951 Clearwater
Drive, Minnetonka, MN  55343;  Tel: 612/933-2277,  Fax: 612/933-
0141) represent a new concept in filtration.  The filter was
developed using a knowledge of crossflow technology.  In crossflow
filtration, the media is continuously cleaned by the process fluid
that flows across the media surface.  The fluid flow is
mechanically restricted downstream, such that a portion of the flow
passes through the media, while the remainder passes beyond the
restriction. The portion that did not go through the media contains
a concentrated level of contaminant.

Spiraltek filters employ the basics of crossflow filtration, but
the downstream restriction is entirely closed.  The result is a
fluid flow that continuously cleans the media surface without a
secondary stream containing concentrated contaminant.  As
contaminant is pushed towards the sealed end of the filter, the
contaminant packs against itself in a non-porous section of the
filter.  Restriction to flow increases very slowly and the filter
operates steadily for a longer period of time.  The end result is
less dependence on the void volume of the media for increased DNC
and a quantum increase in DNC based on the filter construction.

The new filters have been successfully applied in the field and
subjected to unbiased, head-to-head comparison testing.  Test
results show that Spiraltek filters hold three to six times more
contaminant per square foot of filter media when compared to other
pleated filters.

Sugar-Containing
Solutions Softened

A cation-exchange resin-based process for softening aqueous
solutions such as sugar juice or molasses has been investigated.
Michael Saska of the Louisiana State University (LSU, Chemical
Engineering Dept., Baton Rouge, LA 70803; Tel: 504/388-3327)
reports that the sugar cane and sugar beet industries produce large
quantities of non-crystallizable sugar juice, or "sugar factory
molasses."  This molasses has a high sugar content and is treated
to extract the sugars.

Such conventional treatment involves subjecting the molasses to an
ion-exclusion chromatography process using a fixed support of a
strong sodium (Na) or potassium (K) cation resin.  The problem is
that magnesium (Mg) and/or calcium (Ca) salts dissolved in the
molasses and, as charged Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions, replace the Na+ and
K+ ions during the chromatography operation, reducing the
separating power of the technique.  As a result, the chromatography
operation is interrupted periodically to regenerate the cation
resin.

Regeneration reagent is consumed, and productivity is reduced.  One
approach to overcome the problem involves the elimination of the
Ca2+ and/or Mg2+ ions prior to the chromatography step.  Such a
technique also requires the use of a regeneration reagent and has
the additional disadvantage of producing wastewater-containing
sugar, reducing the yield from the overall process.

In the new process, the sugar juice is softened by bringing it into
contact with Na+ and/or K+ cation-exchange resins in a conventional
manner.  The key to the new technique is the regeneration part of
the process, which makes clever use of one of the liquid effluents
in a sugar factory.  The raffinate generated during the
chromatographic separation and charged with Na+ and/or K+ ions is
normally discarded.  The researchers concentrated the raffinate and
used it to regenerate the resin used in the primary separation.
U.S. Patent 5,443,650 covers the new technique.

Japanese Team Turns
Attention to Lithium

Researchers at the Shikoku National Industrial Research Institute
(2217-14 Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu 761-03, Japan) and Sophia
University (7-1 Kioicho, Chiyodaku, Tokyo 102, Japan) have studied
lithium isotope fractionation properties on five kinds of inorganic
ion exchangers with different ion-sieve properties.

Because of its low nuclear cross section for thermal neutrons, 7Li
is useful for the control of corrosion and the pH of coolant waters
in nuclear reactors.  Lithium isotope fractionation by two-phase
chemical exchange has been extensively studied in systems with a
lithium amalgam, lithium metal, an ion-exchange resin, and a
macrocyclic polyether.  However, there have been only a small
number of studies on lithium isotope fractionation with inorganic
ion exchangers since the first pioneer work by Tayler and Urey with
aluminosilicate.

Inorganic ion exchangers have attracted attention owning to their
remarkably high selectivity for certain metal ions or groups of
ions.  The specific characteristics of inorganic ion exchangers
arise partly from their rigid structure, which undergoes little
swelling or shrinking in the aqueous phase.  This brings about a
strong steric effect or an ion-sieve effect for various ions,
depending on the hydrated or dehydrated size of the adsorbing ions.

In the Shikoku/Sophia study, published in Separation Science and
Technology [30(20), 3761-3770, 1995], the lithium isotope
separation factors were determined batchwise in a LiOH or (LiCl +
LiOH) solution at 25C or 20C, respectively.  The separation
factor increased in the order birnessite-type manganese oxide <
hollandite-type manganese oxide <spinel-type manganese oxides <
cubic antiomonic acid in the LiOH solution.

It was dependent on the pore radius of the ion sieve.  The
difference in the separation factor could be well explained by
considering two factors; the difference in hydration circumstances
of Li+ between the ion exchanger and the solution phase, and the
influence of Li+ stabilization in the solid phase.

Characterization of
SPLITT's Personality

SPLITT fractionation (SF) is a relatively new family of separation
techniques primarily, but not exclusively, applicable to
macromolecules and particles.  The efficacy of SF requires an
absence of hydrodynamic mixing between laminae constituting the
thin liquid film streaming through a SPLITT cell, and it requires
structural elements capable of splitting the film evenly along
streamplanes.  These requirements were examined, both
experimentally and by numerical analysis of flow properties near
the inlet splitter, by a team including C. Bor Fuh, Edward M.
Trujillo, and J. Calvin Giddings of the University of Utah (Salt
Lake City, UT 84112).

As reported in Separation Science and Technology [30(20), 3861-
3876, 1995], the SF techniques utilize a thin ribbon-shaped flow
cell and achieve fractionation by differential transport across the
thin (transverse) axis of the cell.  Since the cell is only a few
hundred microns thick, the separation path (which cannot exceed but
may be less than the channel thickness) is extremely short and
separative transport is correspondingly rapid.  Separation is
typically accomplished in only a few minutes.  This is a
particularly valuable feature for fragile biological species that
must be fractionated rapidly to avoid degradation.

SF is capable of continuous operation and is thus useful as a
preparative technique for processing gram, kilogram, or larger
quantities of materials.  The separation is rigorously controlled
by adjusting the two inlet flow rates and the two outlet flow rates
and, in some cases, by altering the strength of the field or
gradient driving the separative transport.  The simplicity of the
SPLITT cell leads to rather rigorous theoretical guidelines on the
conditions necessary to achieve a given level of separation.

The principal transverse driving forces used in SPLITT cells
include gravity, centrifugation, diffusion, and electrical
potential gradients.  However, except for moderate curvature in the
centrifugal SPLITT cell, the geometry of the different cells is
similar.

Among the various topics explored by the University of Utah team,
the one of greatest practical interest is the partial delineation
of a range of flow conditions in which SPLITT fractionation can be
carried out without concern for hydrodynamic disturbances.  The
ability to achieve effective fractionation under these conditions
is supported by experimental results showing that SPLITT cell
performance is in reasonable agreement with theory.

This work also begins to answer the question of how far flow
conditions can be pushed before fractionation is degraded by
hydrodynamic disturbances.  A tentative boundary has been found for
both squared-off splitter edges and tapered edges such that
performance at higher Reynolds numbers and flow asymmetries is
suspect.  Performance beyond these boundaries has not been
significantly tested.

Technetium from
Alkaline Solutions

Technetium (Tc) can be extracted from alkaline solutions of nuclear
waste using a new process formulated by scientists at the
Department of Energy (DOE).  The technique involves contacting the
solution with a solvent containing a crown ether in a diluent.  The
technetium-containing solvent is separated from the solution, and
the Tc is then stripped from the solvent, reports Bruce A. Moyer.

Fission products resulting from the irradiation of nuclear reactor
fuels require long-term storage in an insoluble form.  About 1.8
metric tons of technetium is contained in 60 million gallons of
high-level radioactive wastes stored at Hanford, WA.  These wastes
are highly alkaline, with a pH of at least 13, and are concentrated
in alkali metal nitrates, such as sodium nitrate.  Removal of Tc
from such wastes is a good idea because of safety considerations
and the environmental problems associated with its long-term
storage. These wastes provide a resource from which Tc can be
recovered for experimental uses.

Although crown ethers have previously been considered for the
extraction of technetium under alkali conditions, the impact of
high concentrations of alkali metal nitrates on the distribution
coefficient of technetium has not been addressed.  The DOE
researchers found that the concentration of sodium nitrate in the
waste solution plays a key role in determining the efficiency of
extraction and stripping.  Suitable diluents for use in the DOE
process include aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon, ketone,
pyridine, ether, nitrile, phosphoryl, or alcohol solvents that are
water immiscible and inert.  The technique is covered in U.S.
Patent 5,443,731.
