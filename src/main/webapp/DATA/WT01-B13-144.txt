<I>Will Investors Or The Government Benefit From Inflation Adjusted Treasury Bonds? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
The need for state and local governments to play a greater role combating the
causes of America's new income inequality at a time when the federal government
is promoting devolution of other programs suggests that governors and
legislatures are going to face more formidable challenges during the decade
ahead than at any other time in the modern era.  Their policies in sectors such
as education will not simply affect the economy of their state.  They will also
have a major impact on the wage and employment trends which are driving the
national debate about trade policy, tax policy and federal regulation of the
labor market.  Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to say that the struggle
over America's place in the new global economic order will depend as much on
the policies of state governments as the national government.<p>
<p>
The strength of the national economy and the growth of tax receipts should
permit state governments to manage these challenges during 1996 and 1997.  But
when the U.S. economy experiences another recession, state governments will
have to confront the triple challenge of faltering tax receipts, increased
spending on the unemployed and the impact of new federal block grant system on
the capacity of Washington to help them fund social programs.  In such a
scenario, the deficits of state governments could rise sharply and force them
to curtail spending on capital investment and other services, including
education.<p>
<p>
How will state governments cope with the fiscal hazards posed by devolution and
recession during the late 1990's?  There will be no simple answers because the
U.S. no longer enjoys a broad social consensus about the role of government at
either the federal or state level.  But one obvious solution which could appeal
to both the political left and right would be for state governments to raise
money by privatizing various assets which could be operated more effectively by
the private sector.<p>
<p>
During the past decade, privatization has been a dominant theme for economic
reformers in both the old industrial countries and the developing countries.
The British government privatized its utilities, water systems and airports
during the 1980's.  China, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines are
encouraging the private sector to develop an extensive network of toll roads.
Many Asian countries are also privatizing ports, electric systems, and phone
companies.  Argentina privatized its utility companies during the early 1980's
and is about to privatize its water companies.  In the U.S. private companies
supply about 85% of electricity but the public sector still owns practically
all of the airports and waterworks.  Toll roads played an important role in
America's early infrastructure development but today they account for only
about ten percent of the national highway system.  In 1994, toll roads
collected about $4.6 billion of revenue compared to $71.4 billion of government
receipts from highway user taxes. While it is difficult to put a precise value
on state and local government enterprises, the Reason Foundation has produced a
report suggesting they have a potential market value of about $227 billion.<p>
<p>
A few cities, such as Indianapolis, have promoted the privatization of public
services on the grounds of efficiency but the overall rate of change in the
U.S. has been very modest compared to other industrial countries because state
and local governments have not been confronting fiscal problems on a scale
large enough to require dramatic action. The U.S. federal tax system also
subsidizes public ownership of enterprises, such as airports and water systems,
by permitting state and local governments to sell tax exempt securities.<p>
<p>
Despite the great policy changes occurring in Washington today, state and local
governments enjoy a healthy financial position as a result of both the
economy's benign performance and the large increase in federal assistance which
occurred during the Bush administration.  But they should not permit their
current surpluses to lull them into complacency about the challenges which lie
ahead.<p>
<p>
If the Republicans retain control of Congress, there will be continuing
pressure to lower the federal deficit through reduced financial assistance to
the states.  If they win the White House, the odds would also increase of a
dramatic overhaul of the federal tax system which could jeopardize existing tax
allowances, such as the exemption on state and local government securities, as
a quid pro quo for reducing marginal income tax rates. If the Democrats win,
they will move more slowly to curtail federal spending but they will also be
unable to resist the demographic pressure for cuts in discretionary spending
programs over the long-term.  Devolution and the movement towards block grants
will be manageable for the states during periods of economic growth but when
the economy finally experiences a recession, they will have to finance large
increases in social spending without the support which has traditionally come
from the federal government.  If the federal tax allowance for state and local
securities are  eliminated, they will also have to pay higher interest rates on
their bonds.<p>
<p>
There is no way to predict exactly when these  pressures will converge in a new
crisis.  The timing of any future economic shock will depend upon political and
business cycle factors which are still unfolding.  But the basic thrust of
public policy is very clear.  The federal government will attempt to cope with
the coming upsurge in its entitlement spending for the elderly by shifting more
responsibilities onto the states.  The states will be able to cope with
devolution when the economy is prosperous but the caps on federal block grants
will cause future recessions to increase the pressure on their fiscal positions
by more than other economic downturns in the modern era.  As a result, the odds
are high that devolution will someday be looked back upon as the first stage of
a more comprehensive restructuring of the American public sector which
culminated in the widespread privatization of state and local government
enterprises during the early years of the 21st century.
