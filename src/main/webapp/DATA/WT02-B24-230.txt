</CENTER>

<P>	This guide presents a variety of information about requirements
and bureaucratic matters relating to the Ph.D. program in economics.  It
is important to remember that a number of funding possibilities outside
the University require students to be advanced to candidacy and/or to
have successfully defended a proposal and/or completed a Master's
degree.


<P>     Any questions in regards to the graduate program, particularly
material not covered in this guide but which should have been, should be
addressed to Mary Braun in Room 250 Lorch.  Also ask those questions that
remain about the material covered.  Now just sit back, relax, and
discover the wonderful world of bureaucracy.

<A NAME="Prelims">
<H3>Prelims</H3>
</A>

<P> 	Prelims are given twice a year, May and September.  All students must
register if they are going to take either a field or theory prelim by the
deadline, which is typically a month or so before the exam.  The
registration and deadline are announced via e-mail and posted on flyers
outside the Graduate Student Lounge and Room 250.  It is necessary for
students to register in order to be assigned a number (the prelims are
graded blindly) and in the case of field prelims, to determine which field
committees need to be formed.  There is no penalty for registering and
then not taking the exam.  It is best to inform Mary Braun if you will not
be taking the exam so that no one is kept waiting for you to show up, but
even that is not required.  Prelims must be passed on the schedule
outlined in the <A HREF="rules.html">&quot;Rules and Regulations of the
Graduate Program&quot;</A>.  You are encouraged to take advantage of every
opportunity you have to take a prelim. 

<P> The number under which you registered will be on the copy of the exam
that is given to you.  You use that number on your bluebook (you're
responsible for bringing the bluebook, not the department) instead of your
name as well as the name of the field and the date. In the case of the
macro and micro prelims, you are asked to answer each question in a
separate bluebook.  This is not necessary for the field prelims.  The
prelims are often photocopied to be read by faculty outside of Ann Arbor
(particularly during May) so you are encouraged NOT to write on both sides
of the page, to use ink, and to write clearly. 

<P> Prelim results are announced in a letter from the Director of Graduate
Studies or the Chair.  This letter is held in Room 250 to be picked up for
about two days (announcement that the letter is available goes out on
e-mail).  Any letters not picked up in that time are mailed out to the
address left with Mary Braun.  You can also call or e-mail her for results
if you wish.  Students who know they will be out of Ann Arbor before the
results are available can have their letter mailed immediately.  You can
also request your letter be picked up by whomever you designate. 

<P> Prelim grading timelines vary considerably across fields and across
individual committee members.  Results have been announced in as soon as a
day and as long as four weeks.  Individual results are not posted. 
Pass/fail rates are posted. 

<P> Students can pick up copies of past prelims for review at any time in
Room 250.  The micro and macro theory prelim answers are also available. 
Written answers to the field prelims are not prepared and therefore not
available. 



<A NAME="Cogs">
<H3>Cognates</H3>
</A>

<P>     Every student advanced to candidacy and/or awarded a Master's
degree in Economics must complete two cognate courses.  This is a
Rackham requirement.  Econ 673 counts as one cognate since it is
cross-listed as Stat 505.  You do not need to register the course as
Stat 505 to get cognate credit.  Most LS&amp;A departments give graduate
credit for any 400-level course they offer to students outside their own
discipline.  You may need to register for that course for graduate
credit, however, to have it count as a cognate.  Sometimes, taking a
400-level course for graduate credit involves additional work.  Students
should check with the department that is offering the course to confirm
that the course 1) is approved for graduate credit and 2) if there is
additional work required of students taking it for graduate credit.


<P>     Any undergraduate course that has been approved for graduate
credit, any graduate course in another department, or a cross-listed
graduate-level economics course will fulfill this requirement.  The
requirement is to complete 4 hours of cognate work.

<A NAME="MA">
<H3>Master's Degree</H3>
</A>

<P>     Students have finished a Master's degree in Economics if they
have taken two theory courses (601-604); Econ 653, 654, 673, and 674 or
the equivalency exam in those courses; two cognate courses; and two
field courses.  The field courses can be either a sequence or two
distinct fields.  You must have 30 credit hours on your transcript to be
awarded a Master's and have at least a B (5.00) GPA.


<P> 	Students are encouraged to apply for a Master's as soon as the
appropriate course work is complete.  Many fellowships offered outside the
department and summer internships require applicants to have completed a
Master's degree.  In addition, you will want to note on your CV (resume),
that you have completed a Master's degree.  You can only do this if it is
posted on your transcript.  <EM>It is only posted on your transcript if
you applied and received it.</EM> If you do not apply for it when you
first complete the coursework, you can still apply any term after that. 
However, the date you apply for the degree is the one posted on your
transcript; it will not be back-dated to the date you actually finished
the Master's degree course requirement. 


<P>     Application forms are available by the bulletin board outside
Room 250 Lorch and should be turned into that office.  If the
application is turned in less than two months before the degree is
granted, you will still receive the Master's, but your name will not be
printed in the Convocation program.  Degrees are awarded for April,
August, and December.


<A NAME="Reg">
<H3>Registration after you've completed the required coursework but
before candidacy</H3>
</A>

<P>     All students working as a Graduate Student Research Assistant,
Graduate Student Instructor, or Staff Assistant must be registered for at least
six hours during the term of their appointment, regardless of the
fraction of that appointment.  If you have completed all the required
coursework but are not a candidate, you can register for Econ 990 with a
selection from 1 to 8 hours.  If you don't want to enroll for anything
but Econ 990, you would register for 6 hours.  If you have one course to
take, you can register for 3 hours of Econ 990 which brings your
registration for that term to 6 hours.  Again, you have to fill in the
<A HREF="#Fac">section number</A> of the faculty you will be working on your
pre-dissertation research.  You should both have the same understanding
of just what this pre-dissertation research will encompass during the
term since the faculty will be turning in a grade sheet at the end of
the term for this course.


<A NAME="Fac">
<H3>Faculty Section Numbers</H3>
</A>

<P>	Every faculty has a section number assigned and a list of those 
numbers is posted on the bulletin board across from room 250 Lorch.


<A NAME="Ind">
<H3>Independent reading course</H3>
</A>

<P>     Any student who has worked out an independent reading course
with an appropriate faculty member registers for Econ 700, the 
<A HREF="#Fac">section number</A> of the faculty, and a selection of 1 to 8 
credit hours (typically 3 credit hours).


<A NAME="Visit">
<H3>Visiting a course</H3>
</A>

<P>     You can enroll in any graduate economics course as a visit
instead of credit.  Each faculty determines the parameters of the visit
status for their own course and it is important that you talk to the
faculty prior to enrolling.  Your transcript will list the course grade
as VI.  The VI never turns into a grade or figures into your grade point
average.  The same tuition charge is assessed for a visit as it is for
courses taken for credit.

<A NAME="Inc">
<H3>Incompletes</H3>
</A>

<P>     Individual faculty are responsible for setting the incomplete
policy for their own course. You must talk to the faculty to come to an
understanding that an incomplete will be given for any particular course
and just what remains to be completed.  There is no time limit for
completing the work unless imposed by the faculty.  The faculty turns in
an I on the grade sheet and that I appears as the grade on your
transcript.  Once the work has been completed, that I is crossed out on
the transcript and the grade you received is posted beside it.

<A NAME="Trav">
<H3>Travel Grants</H3>
</A>

<P>     Rackham provides some travel grant money for students who are
delivering a paper at a conference.  The money for this program is in the 
process of being transferred to the department and details about the 
program will be publicized when they become available.  The Department 
will award $150 plus 1/2 of the remaining travel expenses up to $300 if a 
student is presenting a paper at the meeting of a recognized economic 
organization.  The department travel award is available only once to
students over the course of their program and can't be used to give or
attend seminars at other universities.


<A NAME="RAs">
<H3>Research Assistantships</H3>
</A>

<P>     Research assistants are hired on an <I>ad hoc</I> basis by individual
faculty using whatever criteria they feel are appropriate.  Research
assistants at .25 fraction and above receive a full tuition waiver,
GradCare health insurance, and a stipend based on their fraction.  Most
research assistants are hired by word of mouth among the faculty and
they are the best source of information about who among them have such a
position available.  Occasionally, a research assistant position will be
posted on e-mail, outside Room 250 Lorch, or outside the office of the 
faculty advertising the position.

<A NAME="GSIs">
<H3>Graduate Student Instructors</H3>
</A>

<P> Graduate Student Instructors are hired by the graduate program in the
procedure outlined in the <A HREF="rules.html">
&quot;Rules and Regulations of the Graduate Program&quot;</A>.  
GSIs are hired by term.  Applications are typically available outside of
Room 250 Lorch early in April for the following fall term.  If you are
interested in teaching only in the winter term, check with the graduate
program office in October.  There are only a few GSI positions available in
the Spring or Summer term and only those with prior teaching experience
are eligible. 

<A NAME="Hour">
<H3>Graders and Hourly Employees</H3>
</A>

<P>     Faculty often advertise for Ph.D. students to work as hourly
employees or graders. Graders differ from GSIs because they are not
working the same set of hours every week of the term.  Many times an
advertised research assistant position is really a temporary hourly
position. Although the duties fall under a research assistant title, the
position is only funded to allow a student to be paid <I>X</I> number of
dollars per hour and the student turns in the number of hours worked on
a bi-weekly basis.  If you are offered either of these positions, you
must complete the necessary paperwork in the Main Office, Room 238 Lorch
before you can be paid.

<A NAME="Cand">
<H3>Candidacy</H3>
</A>

<P>     To be advanced to candidacy, Ph.D. students in economics must
have the following requirements completed:

<OL>
    <LI>Passed the micro theory prelim

    <LI>Passed the macro theory prelim

    <LI>Passed two field prelims
    
    <LI>Completed Econ 653, 654, 673, 674 with a grade of B- or
	above or passed the equivalency exam

    <LI>Completed two cognate courses with a grade of B- or above.
	If you have taken Econ 673, this counts as a cognate since it is
	cross-listed as Stat 505.  You do not have to be registered in Stat 505
	to get credit for this as a cognate.

    <LI>Completed a course in either Econ 675, 677, 775, 776, or
	75X with a grade of B- or above
</OL>


<P>     The graduate program office prepares the paperwork for Rackham
for students to be advanced to candidacy.  It is a good idea to let the
office know when you have completed the requirements (or within a term
of completing) just to make sure that the paperwork is being done.


<P>     The term you get advanced to candidacy, you register for 8 hours
of Econ 995.  The <A HREF="#Fac">section number</A> should be the faculty 
member who is the chair of your committee.  (The list of faculty and their 
numbers is posted on the bulletin board across from Room 250 Lorch.)  Since 
few folks know who this is the first term they are advanced to candidacy,
you should enroll with a faculty member in your major research field.
Always check with the faculty you have chosen before you register.  Each
faculty has their own expectation of what dissertation research involves
in any given term.  Since the faculty turn in a grade sheet (marked
S-satisfactory or U-unsatisfactory) at the end of the term, <B>it is very
important that both of you understand just what constitutes satisfactory
progress during the term</B>.


<P>     If you are registering before your candidacy paperwork has been
processed through Rackham, you must register for 8 hours of Econ 990
with the same section number procedure outlined above.  Once the
registrar gets notice via the computer from Rackham's database, your
election will automatically be changed to the correct Econ 995
registration.


<P>     Why get advanced to candidacy as soon as you can:  to save
money.  Candidacy fees are substantially less than out-state tuition.
Even if you are not picking up the tab, graduate students who are
candidates are much more attractive hires for faculty recruiting
research assistants since the tuition charge is less.  In addition,
several fellowship programs and internships require applicants to be
candidates.  The department encourages students to become candidates as
soon as possible in their academic careers.


<P>     Candidates can enroll for one free course every term.  You can
take this free course for credit or as a visit.  Candidates are
encouraged to enroll for the field seminar that is most appropriate for
their research interest each term.  If there is a term in which the
candidate enrolls only for dissertation research, you can enroll for two
free courses in any subsequent term.  You can not register for two free
courses the first time you become a candidate with the expectation that
you will not take any courses in the next term.  If a student enrolls
for Econ 995 and two courses in the first term of candidacy or when they
have not &quot;banked&quot; a course from a previous term, the student
will be charged full-time out-state tuition.

<A NAME="Def">
<H3>Proposal Defense</H3>
</A>

<P>     All students must defend a proposal by September 30 of the year
they go on the job market.  What is a proposal?  It is whatever your
committee, and particularly your committee chairperson, says it is.  The
proposal defense is entirely within the province of the department.
Therefore, you do not need to be registered for the term in which you
defend your proposal. There is, however, a proposal defense form that
your committee completes and returns to the graduate program office. The
student must also turn in a copy of the proposal to the graduate program
office.


<P>     The graduate program recommends that all members of the
dissertation committee attend the proposal defense.  However, this is
often not the case.  Many proposal defenses do not include one or more
members of the committee due to scheduling difficulties or uncertainty
over the cognate member.  The dissertation chair determines what
constitutes appropriate attendance at the proposal defense.  The advice
of the graduate program office would be to caution the student that it
is important that all members of the dissertation committee be clear
about the topic and the direction of your research.


<P>     A proposal defense can be graded as a Pass; Pass II, subject to
approval of suggested minor changes; Provisional Pass, subject to
approval of major changes; and Rejection.  A student expecting to go on
the job market must have obtained either a Pass or Pass II at their
proposal defense.


<P> 	In order to remain in Group 1 for a graduate student instructor
position, a student must successfully defend his or her proposal by the
beginning of the fifth year. 

<A NAME="Comm">
<H3>Dissertation Committee Membership</H3>
</A>

<P>     All dissertation committees must have at least four members.  At
least two of those must be faculty in the economics department.  You can
have as many committee members (over the four required) that you think
appropriate.  However, you should be aware that the more committee
members, the greater the likelihood of encountering scheduling difficulties.
You must have one cognate member on your committee.  The cognate member
must have a regular appointment in a Rackham department.  You can have
members of your committee that are not associated with the University or
with a Rackham department, but they can not be the sole chair of the
committee or the cognate member.  Every member of your dissertation
committee must have a Ph.D.


<P>     Your dissertation committee must be approved by Rackham.
Typically, the graduate program office completes the paperwork once you
have defended your proposal using the names listed on the proposal form.
However, if you defended your proposal without a complete committee,
this can't be done.  There is no notification to your dissertation
committee members that they have been nominated or approved for this
service.  A dissertation committee can be changed at any time.  Rackham
requires all students to have their dissertation committee approval
forms completed prior to a format check.
