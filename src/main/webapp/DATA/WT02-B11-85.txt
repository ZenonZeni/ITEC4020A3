<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   Menem kept his promise to take on powerful union
interests, announcing a package of labor  reforms. Intended to make businesses
less hesitant to hire workers, the measures include important changes to
severance pay and union health plan funding.  &#167;  The IMF sees an optimistic
6% GDP growth in 1997 and appears to have softened its position on budget
balance.  &#167;  Congress has watered down the economy ministry's revenue-
boosting package and delayed approval.  Page 2</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   Privatization of mining giant Vale do Rio Doce
could begin in February under a three-stage plan  disclosed by the national
development bank, but debate rages over how to price the mega-deal.  &#167; 
Even as President Cardoso's favored candidates stumble badly heading into
municipal elections, the president's supporters are turning to old-fashioned
radio and television concessions in an effort to convince legislators to grant
him a shot at second term as president.  Page 3</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>  &#167;   Environmentalists are gaining force after
authorities rejected the environmental impact study for  Endesa's Ralco
hydropower plant, a setback that will likely delay the project by as much as a
year.  &#167;  Massad may still slip in as central bank chief if negotiations to
revive his candidacy succeed.  &#167;  The central bank projects the economy
will slow to a still-solid 5.5-6% growth in 1997.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   Abandoned by his vice-president, facing a
weakening economy and a new guerrilla offensive,  Samper is digging in his heels
even though a revival of his severely eroded authority seems ever  less likely.
&#167; The finance ministry has drawn the ire of the business community over a
mandatory war bond proposal intended to raise $420 million to fight the
guerrillas.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;  Since it appeared in late June, the EPR guerrilla
group has become an enigma, more important for its  potential impact on
politics, financial markets and the Zedillo presidency than for its actual
military strength.  The government is maintaining tight fiscal and monetary
policies, resisting the temptation to boost spending in hopes of inducing faster
growth.   Page 6</P>
<P><B>PERU</B>  &#167;   Shifting to a hands-on industrial policy, President
Fujimori announced tax incentives to boost economic  activity, especially
exports and used-car import conversions, in the undeveloped south.  &#167; 
Japan came through with $615 million in yen-denominated soft loans for
infrastructure.  &#167;  Fujimori has won congressional approval to run for a
third presidential term, but faces a constitutional tribunal challenge.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA  </B> &#167;   Though it has declared the banking crisis over,
the government is still picking up the pieces  and seeking congressional
approval of an $800 million fund to keep banks on the recovery track.  &#167; 
Aluminum- producing heavyweights are lined up for a chance to buy CVG aluminum
properties as government officials work to resolve the dispute with Japanese
investors in Venalum that has kept the sell-off on hold.  &#167;  High oil
prices may completely close this year's budget gap.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>REGIONAL OUTLOOK</B>  &#167;   Prospects for economic growth in Latin
America in 1997 are merely mediocre,  failing to bear out the optimism that will
have lured over $63 billion in international capital to the region this year.
Though projected 3-4% average growth is not bad, it's not good enough to protect
governments from underlying political rifts like ongoing turmoil in Mexico and
Colombia. Wise investors will also be wary of presidential re- election dreams,
which may sidetrack meaningful economic reform in Brazil.  Pages 9-10</P>

<H1>Endesa's Hydropower Plan Fails Environmental Test, Faces Months of Delay</H1>
<P>Environmental concerns are slowing another important development project,
this time in the electricity sector. The Ralco hydropower plant, Chile's biggest
electricity generation project, has failed to win approval for its environmental
impact study. As a result, it faces serious delays. Environmental authorities
are taking a hard line with the project, partly in answer to critics who say
they are nothing more than a rubber stamp. The 580 MW plant, a keystone of power
generator Endesa's development plan, also faces local opposition. This is the
second major development in Chile (following plans for an ambitious forestry
project in Tierra del Fuego) to be slowed by environmental issues  (LL 8/30/96).</P>
<P><B>Data Deficient. </B>Endesa received the bad news that its environmental
impact study for Ralco, submitted in March, had been found wanting.
Environmental authorities maintain that the assessment does not follow the
agreed-upon terms of reference, omits important parts of the project,
underestimates the area of impact and does not include a resettlement plan for
the Pehuenche Indians who will lose their homes when the reservoir is filled.
</P>
<P><B>Back To The Drawing Board. </B>The ruling means that Endesa must now
undertake a major rewrite of the study and will face a delay of up to a year
before the project can be approved. The company hopes to have the plant
operating by 2002. While technically the Ralco plan began before the new rules
requiring impact studies were imposed, Endesa would still find it difficult to
finance the $460 million project without official approval. The company has
already touched a nerve by beginning preliminary work on Ralco, even without
that approval. Endesa has also upset officials with the same behavior at a
gas-fired plant project in Santiago. </P>
<P>The Ralco plant is particularly important for Endesa as a way to  maintain
or even increase its current 60% share of the generating market while retaining
its identity as a hydro-based company. The company argues that the plant is a
competitive alternative to gas-fired generation, which will make its debut next
year. Ralco is also a necessary complement to the company's nearly com pleted
450 MW Pangue plant, slightly downriver from Ralco's location on the Bio-Bio
River in the south. </P>
<P><B>Local Population Problem. </B>Some 70 Pehuenche Indian families live in
the area to be flooded and all will need to be resettled. They are protected by
legislation that prevents their being moved against their will. So far, the
Indians have not accepted the resettlement terms offered by Endesa.  </P>
<P><B>Bad For The Economy?</B> Local opponents are more worried about the
plant's negative impact on the local economy than its environmental effects.
Another region where Endesa has operations is cited as a case in point. That
area is estimated to have lost half its population over the last 20 years,
despite the existence of three Endesa plants. Ralco itself is expected to create
1,600 jobs during the construction phase of the project, but this would drop to
less than 50 once operations begin.</P>
<H2>Wrangling Continues Over Central Bank Post</H2>
<P>Carlos Massad may still get his chance as president of the central bank (LL
7/19/96). Massad, a respected economist, has been caught in the middle of a
power play between the government and the congressional opposition over the
broader issue of central bank autonomy. After the senate loudly rejected his
nomination last month, negotiations have continued behind the scenes (LL
8/30/96). </P>
<P><B>Stacking The Deck. </B>Each of the three previous appoint ments to the
central bank have been drawn from the government coalition's own ranks or its
sympathizers. Massad, who would have been the fourth, was the last straw for the
opposition senate majority, even though the rejecting senators acknowledge that
his qualifications were never in doubt. The government argues that the
opposition is motivated by petty political interests. Privately, it has been
forced to admit to its own role in the contretemps and is now trying to patch
things up. Meanwhile Massad is in political limbo, having stepped down as health
minister to be eligible for the central bank appointment.</P>
<H3>ECONOMY TO SLOW IN 1997</H3>
<P>The central bank's annual report on the economy projects the economy will
slow slightly in 1997, but maintain solid growth. As tight monetary policies and
lower export prices begin to bite, growth is expected to slow from 6.5-7.0% in
1996 to 5.5-6.0% next year.</P>
<P><B>Copper Prices Hurt. </B>The bank predicts the trade deficit will widen
from $600 million this year to $950 million in 1997. The current account gap is
projected to be around 4% of GDP. One important factor is the anticipated drop
in the price of copper. The central bank's estimates of an average price of
$1.04/lb for this year and $0.95/lb next year are more optimistic than those of
many market analysts. </P>
<P>The bank projects inflation will fall to 5.5% in 1997 from 6.5% this year.
This reflects the official goal of bringing Chilean inflation down to that of
industrial ized countries by 2000.</P>
