<BR>

<BODY>

Why leave the delivery of your government check to chance?  By

filling out a single form, you can avoid those time-consuming

trips to the bank and rest assured that your check won't be stolen,

lost or delayed in the mail. If you receive a Social Security

check or other government payments on a regular basis, you've

probably been contacted in recent months about having your checks

deposited directly into your bank account

<P>

<B>A trend of the future</B>  

<P>

The U.S. Treasury Department this summer announced that

all Social Security recipients who apply for benefits after August

1, 1996, will have their checks automatically deposited into their

bank accounts whenever possible.  In addition, by 1999 all federal

payments, including salaries and other benefits such as those

paid to veterans, will be issued electronically.  Jim Hagedorn,

the Treasury Department's director of public affairs for the financial

management service, reports that converting to electronic payments

could save the government as much as $500 million over the next

five years and eliminate about 100,000 check thefts and forgeries

a year.

<P>

<B>Kemper Funds can help</B>

<P>

As an alternative to your bank account, consider having your government

checks deposited directly into your Kemper Money Funds account.

 Kemper Money Funds offer the opportunity to earn higher yields

<I>and</I> easy access to your money - as of September 5, 1996,

Kemper Money Market Fund's current 7-day yield was 5.04% while

the average bank money fund yield was 2.65%* - and many checking

accounts don't pay interest. Of

course, unlike bank products, no money fund is insured or guaranteed

by the U.S. government and there is no assurance that any fund

can maintain a $1.00 share value. Bank products offer fixed or variable 
rates and principal is fixed and may be insured. 

<P>

Once your government check is deposited into your Kemper Money

Fund, you can write an unlimited amount of checks (for $500 or

more) each month free, or use our EXPRESS-Transfer service to

transfer as little as $100 into your bank savings or checking

account.  You can also exchange a portion of the deposit to another

Kemper fund for long-term income or growth opportunities.  Plus,

you can make and verify account transactions 24-hours a day via

our automated phone service, KemperACCESS.  

<P>

Kemper's three money funds offer you these services and attractive

yields while maintaining a conservative investment philosophy

that emphasizes quality and consistency, not risk-taking.

<P>

To receive a Government Direct Deposit form, contact the government

agency that issues your checks.  Or, call Kemper Shareholder Services

at 1-800-621-1048.  Our representatives can provide the necessary

form (ask for Form 93) and answer your questions about Kemper

Money Funds' performance and services. 

<P>

* Yield shown is the average annualized net investment income

per share.  Past performance is historical and is no guarantee

of future results.  Yields will fluctuate.  Bank interest rate

shown is for the 100 leading banks and thrifts as of 9/5/96 according

to <I>Bank Rate Monitor</I>.
