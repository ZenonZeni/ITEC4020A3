CUS RELIEVED BY IRS' RULE OVER DEBT REPORTS

The Internal Revenue Service's final rule on reporting of discharge
of indebtedness is much more acceptable to the lending industry than the
proposed regulation, which ran into a firestorm when published for comment
in 1993.
        Tim Pryor, director of NAFCU's regulatory compliance office, told
Credit Union Accountant the IRS' rule is significant for credit unions
because it eases the paperwork burden in two areas: when bankruptcies are
filed and when a debt is discharged by state law.
        The amount of debt written off isn't the most important aspect, the
debt loss will be the same despite this rule, Pryor said. The rule is most
significant because it reduces the amount the paperwork, he said.
        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, require
financial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C information
returns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600
or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders because
they say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven in
excess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.
        Lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigating the
need to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRS for
several years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need to
forgive debt.
        Pryor said the final rule is "a very big issue for credit unions
because the previous rule would have required a credit union to file a 1099
when a debtor went bankrupt." And since bankruptcies are on the rise and
expected to increase, credit unions would have been inundated with
paperwork. (See related story page 4).
        According to Wayne Winegarden, a NAFCU staff economist, "a rise in
bankruptcies since December 1994 is evident in the call report data, and
other preliminary data supports the idea that the December 1995
bankruptcies will increase even further."
        The previous rule, Pryor said, would also have required a credit
union to file a 1099 whenever a debt was discharge by state law--something
he said is next to impossible for a credit union to assess. He said it's
difficult for a credit union to figure out the statute of limitations on
each debt and the actual date the debt was discharged. "Operation of state
law only applies when it is raised as a defense," he said.
        The final regulation says that disclosure to the IRS of debt
forgiveness will be required only when one of the following "identifiable
events" occur:
         The failure of the borrower to make any payments on a debt for
three years with no significant collection activity by the financial
institution.
         A contractual modification or discharge between the financial
institution and the borrower.
         Discharges in bankruptcy of business loans, but not for consumer
loans.
         The successful assertion in court by the borrower of the statute
of limitations as a bar to collection.
         The cancellation of a debt by receivership, foreclosure, or
probate proceedings.
         The expiration of the statutory period for commencing a proceeding
on a judgment.
        Credit unions must comply with these requirements for discharges
occurring on or after Dec. 22, 1996.
        It's important for credit unions to note, however, that the IRS has
provided several exceptions to the list of "identifiable events," said
Cornelia Schneider, the National Association of Federal Credit Union's
associate director of taxation and accounting.
        "Specifically, discharges in bankruptcy are not reportable unless
the credit union knows that the member incurred the indebtedness for
business or investment purposes," Schneider said. "A credit union will not
have to report a discharge of indebtedness upon the expiration of the
statute of limitations if a member's affirmative defense is upheld in a
financial judgment or decision of a judicial proceeding and the period for
appealing has expired. In addition, the final regulations do not require
interest to be included in the reporting of amounts discharged."

SAR, CTR EXEMPTION LIST MIGHT EMERGE MARCH 1

The new Suspicious Activity Report form, reported by sources last
week to be due out by Feb. 1, will most likely come out March 1 at the
earliest, and might contain a threshold for money laundering, a Treasury
official told Credit Union Accountant.
        Banks will begin using the forms when the final regulation becomes
effective.
        The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) also hopes to
release a preliminary Currency Transaction Reporting exemption process in
conjunction with the SAR.
        As proposed, the SAR had no threshold for suspicious activities
involving money laundering. As a final rule, a FinCEN source said on Jan.
17 that, in response to comments received from the industry, Treasury may
include an as-yet unspecified threshold for money laundering. This is the
only threshold the regulators say will possibly change from what has been
previously proposed.
        The SAR, to be administered by FinCEN and federal regulators, is
proposed to be used to report suspicious transactions of bank fraud,
insider abuse, etc. involving a specific customer if $5,000 or more is
involved. If no particular individual can be identified, the threshold will
increase to $25,000.
        The form replaces the old Criminal Referral Form and a box on the
Currency Transaction Report. The form will be required to be filed with
FinCEN only rather than with a number of agencies.
        "It is unlikely that the new SAR will be out by Feb. 1," said a
FinCEN official. "Each of the agencies has to finalize its own regulation,
the database which accepts the suspicious transactions has to be up and
running, and the form has to be ready. FinCEN's reg is in the clearance
process, as well as are the other agencies' regs, I believe. The form
itself is close to being final and the database is operational.
        "The instructions on the form, telling you when and what to file
are subject to change, since the instructions are driven by the reg itself,
which has still to be issued as final."
        A preliminary exemption list for Currency Transaction Reporting is
also expected to be released in conjunction with the SAR release, said an
agency official.
        "There is a two phase approach," said the source. "The easy stuff
will be a (not-specified-yet) existing list--something like the stock
exchange list that people can refer to by opening up a newspaper and lists
businesses that are already exemptible under current regulation. Phase two,
the rest of the exemptions of local places, we are still working out. My
guess is that the second list will come as a proposed rulemaking, up for
comment."
        "Law enforcement, regulators and the industry all agree that there
are too many CTRs, but we need to finalize the process, which will reduce
burden, without impeding law enforcement." --Lisa Troshinsky

EXAMINERS GET LIBERTY IN CUSO LIMITS

NCUA has said that for purposes of CUSO loan and investment
limitations, an examiner can decide on a case-by-case basis to value a CUSO
either at original cash investment or by an equity method of accounting.
        The regulator said even though these limitations are statutorily
derived, it gives its examiners leeway because statutory and regulatory
history provide no clear answers.
        Michael L. Miller, assistant vice president for compliance at
Indiana FCU, Indianapolis, wrote to NCUA Sept. 11 and asked several
questions concerning the loan and investment limitations for CUSOs in
Region IV.
        Miller first asked if the 1% investment limit in a CUSO is based on
the original cash investment or the equity method. He explained that in
January 1994, Indiana FCU invested $100,000 in Indiana Members Financial
Services Inc., a wholly owned CUSO that is the sole owner of three other
CUSOs--a mortgage company, a vehicle leasing company and a collection
company. During the first year, Miller said, IMFS lost $36,000. He asked if
IFCU's CUSO should use the original investment of $100,000 or the equity
method balance of $64,000 to calculate the investment for the 1% limit.
        In legal opinion letter No. 95-0930, dated Dec. 13, Richard
Schulman, NCUA's associate general counsel, told Miller that IFCU should
use the aggregate cash outlay figure of the original investment of $100,000
to calculate the CUSO investment limitation. Schulman noted, however, that
for measuring a credit union's investment to a CUSO in financial
statements, GAAP should be followed. GAAP uses a cost method, equity method
or consolidated financial statements as measurements.
        Miller also asked if IFCU's original cash investment in the IMFS
subsidiary companies be included in the calculation or should it use the
equity method's balance.
        Schulman replied that IFCU's original cash investment, being the
aggregate cash outlay, in the other CUSO's should also be included in the
calculation. He said this is what is meant by "aggregate" limitation.
        Miller then inquired whether IFCU's lines of credit to the mortgage
CUSO and leasing CUSO were considered a loan to a CUSO for the 1% limit
since these organizations are not directly owned by the credit union. He
explained that when IFCU owned the second tier CUSO directly, lines of
credit to the mortgage CUSO and leasing CUSO were established. The lines of
credit are to fund loans and leases until the underlying loan or lease
instrument is sold back to IFCU or another investor. --Melanie Waddell

BRIEFS


Fed To Issue Study
On Check Fraud
        The Federal Reserve Board has asked financial institutions to
comment on a proposed one-time check fraud survey that will help it fulfill
the congressional mandate to report on the advisability of modifying the
Expedited Funds Availability Act.
        The changes to the EFAA, which is implemented through Regulation
CC, would extend the maximum permissible hold period for local checks as a
way to decrease losses related to check fraud.
        Comments are due to the Fed by Feb. 20. Data collected from the
survey will cover the period Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 1995.
        Congress has also directed the Fed to study:
         Whether a pattern of significant increases in losses related to
check fraud at depository institutions attributable to the provisions of
the EFAA exists.
         Whether an extension by one day of the period between the deposit
of a local check and the availability of funds for withdrawal would be
effective in reducing the volume of losses related to check fraud.
         Whether to make recommendations for legislative actions.
        The survey will gather information about the relationship of all
funds availability schedules mandated in the EFAA to check-fraud losses as
well as specific information about the types of check fraud and the causes
of check fraud losses at depository institutions.
        A copy of the proposed survey and instructions, the Paperwork
Reduction Act Submission (OMB 83-1), supporting statement, and other
documents may be requested from Mary M. McLaughlin, Federal Reserve Board
clearance officer at (202) 452-3829, Division of Research and Statistics,

Hawaii Auditing Firm
Acquired by Big-Sixer
        A Honolulu-based accounting firm that specializes in credit unions
was acquired by a CPA giant earlier this month, creating an extended
auditing base on the West Coast and Hawaii.
         Kwock & Co. CPA Inc., in the Aloha State, was taken over by KPMG
Peat Marwick LLP Jan.1. The move allows KPMG to provide services for the
first time in Hawaii.
        "They absorbed me," said Steven Kwock, said head of the CPA firm
that bears his name.
        Kwock added the merger allows for more resources in the future.
        "I'm looking to the year 2000. I'm also looking ahead technology
wise as well including the Internet. Credit unions are moving from on-line
services to in-house (operations)," Kwock told Credit Union Accountant.
        Kwock said he works exclusively as a credit union auditor, and
since the merger, his position becomes the director of credit union
accounts in Hawaii and the Pacific Southwest region for KPMG Peat Marwick.
        Kwock said he audits 65% of the credit union audit market in
Hawaii, which totals $3.1 billion. Until now, KPMG had no share of that
market. Before the merger, the Big Six firm served 69 credit unions
totaling $17 million in assets.

NAFCU's Tech '96 Show
Set for San Jose, Calif.
        At a time when many institutions are trying to beat the ever-
ticking technology clock, NAFCU has chimed in with a conference and trade
show in Silicon Valley to showcase the latest in high-tech creature
features for credit unions.
        Credit unions of the 21st century, new financial systems and
technology issues will be featured Feb. 8-9 in San Jose, Calif., as CU
executives and vendors gather for NAFCU's Tech '96 trade show and
educational program.
        "We want to have a forum to provide technology to those who have
already implemented technology," said Ken Robinson, president of the
National Association of Federal Credit Unions.
        Robinson added the conference has an added value because the
technology experts can point to some of the pitfalls technological services
occasionally bring to the marketplace.
        Highlighting the show will be Keynote Speaker Richard Stroth, the
executive director of CSC Vanguard, the research and advisory arm of
Computer Sciences Corp. Stroth is a strategist on the application of
emerging information technologies.
        For conference registration information, call (703) 276-2772.

CU Auditing Firm
Acquired by Insurance Co.
        A credit union auditing firm has been acquired by an insurance
company--a move the auditing firm hopes will help it break into the
insurance business.
        American Indemnity Co. Ltd., a firm based in the British West
Indies, acquired a 54% controlling interest in International Standards
Group Ltd., a Florida-based company that specializes in supervisory audits
for more than 300 credit unions through agreements with several leagues.
        "This is the first step in our overall plan to expand into the
insurance business," said Joseph Lents, president and founder of ISG, in a
recent statement. Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit union
services.
        A source within the industry told Credit Union Accountant that ISG
is attempting to expand into insurance because it's not making any money
from supervisory committee audits.
        Attempts to reach ISG were unsuccessful.

COURT: MEMBERS CAN'T SHIRK STUDENT LOAN DEBTS

An important legal ruling handed down in Massachusetts could calm
fears of credit union CFOs and strengthen the long arm of debt collection.
        In the case, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said CU members
can't use bankruptcy as a method to avoid paying off student loans. The
December ruling also is significant because, for the first time, a court
said that federal credit unions are "government units" for purposes of
having educational loans nondischargeable.
        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy
proceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofit
organization.
        The ruling stemmed from a suit brought by T.I. Federal Credit Union
in Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.
DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case went
before the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definition
of both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for these
loans.
        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.
        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylaws
provided that shareholders get a dividend," Koban said. He won this point
in bankruptcy court.
        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its case
to U.S. district court, which ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.
        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the
"government unit" status, so the case was appealed. The 1st Circuit said
federal credit unions are, in fact, government units, so it didn't see the
need to address whether it was also a nonprofit.
        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning of
this section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)
offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.
        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpayments
are nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifying
as a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,
insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor's
loans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters of
either provision," the 1st Circuit said.
        Koban, reached by Credit Union Accountant, asked rhetorically
whether this ruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bank
is a "government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested the
law should simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period.
This ruling is counter intuitive."
        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn't
address the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress is
the only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, not
the courts.
        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'
educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.
        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.
        According to the brief of the case, T.I. federal credit union
advanced loans as part of its special educational loan program. This
program differs from standard loan programs in that it allows for lower
interest rates, gives borrowers longer repayment periods and allows loans
to be aggregated in maximum amounts greater than those permitted under
personal loan programs. The program also enables borrowers to
simultaneously borrow additional funds and refinance outstanding balances
on previous loans.
        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times for
assistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into a
single promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes
$32,618.
        His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but his
lawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely. --Ken Reed

CREDIT UNIONS AND STUDENT LOANS, A YEAR-END BREAKDOWN

One-third of all credit unions that give student loans offer only
Guaranteed Student Loans (FFELs), one-third offer only other types of
student loans and a third offer both, year-end 1994 CUNA data show.
        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage of
credit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.
Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a credit union that lends
FFELs, and 37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lends
other types of student loans, CUNA said.
        FFELs are generally preferred because a larger portion of the risk
is shared with the government.
        A study by the National Association of Federal Credit Unions found
that, of the 336 member CUs responding to its survey, the average credit
union offering student loans has $240 million in assets while the average
credit union not offering such loans has $103 million in assets.

FOCUS ON FASB


AcSEC To Explore
Balance Sheet
        The Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is considering a new
project to determine when various types of securities transactions should
be recorded on the balance sheet.
        Currently, these transactions can be settled in regular ways, in
accordance with normal market practice, or with delayed delivery, where the
counterparties agree on a settlement date. There are also more contingent
transactions, such as those in the mortgage market, which are referred to
as "to-be-announced" trades.
        The issue AcSEC will consider is whether each of these types of
transactions should be recorded on the balance sheet on the trade date or
on the settlement date. Until now, there has been diversity in practice as
to when these transactions are recorded, which has raised questions among
users of the instruments.

FASB Extracts Leases
From Hedging Project
        The Financial Accounting Standards Board narrowed significantly the
scope of the hedging and derivatives project Dec. 21 when it decided that
leases would not be included.
        The project, in its current form, provides the option of marking
derivative instruments or all financial instruments to market. While other
financial instruments may suffer this fate, the current method to account
for leases will not be affected by the outcome of the project.
        "One reason the Board decided not to include leases was that it
would expand the scope of the project considerably," said Jennifer Clark, a
FASB staffer. "The Board decided to remain narrower and deal with the
issues that most concern hedging and derivatives."
        Robert Conklin, one of the three FASB staffers in charge of the
project, said in the meeting that the Board previously had decided not to
include leases in the scope of two other FASB statements due to the
difficulty in separating the value of the monetary portion of the lease
from the nonmonetary portion. The same reasoning applies to the hedging
project, he said.
        He also noted that the staff was concerned about the lack of
valuation methodologies for leases, another one of the numerous complicated
issues relating to leases. So instead of including leases in the
derivatives project, the staff recommended considering a new project on the
capitalization or valuation of all leases.
        The Board also agreed that the interest component of a change in
the value of a derivative financial instrument, other than an option,
should be recognized in earnings in the period the change occurs, and that
the interest rate to be used would be the current market rate.
        In addition, the initial premium, or the time value component,
related to written or purchased options should be amortized into earnings
on a straight-line basis over the life of the option. Further, any gain on
a purchased option should be recognized in earnings to the extent that
expense has been recognized for the option premium paid.

Comprehensive Income
Takes Tiny Step Forward
        The Financial Accounting Standards Board debated Dec. 22 how to
report accounting adjustments, comprising prior-period adjustments and
cumulative-effective adjustments, and concluded that they should be
reported in the same place. Which place, however, remains unclear.
        The decision represents at least another minor step forward in
FASB's comprehensive income project, which began deliberations in late fall
and seeks to define a new location for items currently not reported in the
income statement. The board began discussing the project on Nov. 29 when it
tentatively decided that all recognized items of comprehensive income
should be reported in one or more statements of income for financial
performance.
        The Board began discussing precisely what those items are by
examining prior-period adjustments and cumulative-effect adjustments, of
which only the latter is currently included in net income. The matter
becomes complicated because some changes in principle are reported as
cumulative effect adjustments in certain situations and prior-period
adjustments in others.
        To clarify the matter, the Board requested the staff to develop
examples illustrating the three different approaches for reporting
accounting adjustments, which the staff has already outlined. The first one
is the "comprehensive income approach," which would interpret comprehensive
income strictly and exclude accounting adjustments. The second approach,
referred to as "all-inclusive income," would interpret comprehensive income
broadly, equating it with the all-inclusive income concept, and excluding
accounting adjustments. The final "compromise" approach would report both
comprehensive income and all-inclusive income, with accounting adjustments
being displayed as the difference between the two.
        The staff, headed up by project manager Todd Johnson, said that any
of these three approaches would be workable if they were applied
consistently over time. The staff also said that the current status quo
approach not be adopted as an official standard, as it is not consistent
with either a strict interpretation of comprehensive income or the all-
inclusive concept.
