<H2>Introduction</A></H2>
<P>
The Cabot Market Letter, published since 1970, has developed a
growing, faithful following of individual investors as well as
banks, mutual funds, and other institutions. For the most part
these investors are not interested in a short-term trading approach
where only the tax man and stockbroker benefit. They are interested
in taking positions in growing situations where some rather substantial
profits can be accumulated over a period of months or even years.
<P>
This Momentum Analysis report will introduce you to some new ideas
of stock selection. You will find out why certain companies, with
no apparent investment following, began to turn into growing successful
enterprises. And, you will be exposed to several former most-admired
blue chip stocks where the forward momentum began to slacken months
before the realization of problems by the investing public. UNCEASING
CHANGE, FOR THE BETTER OR WORSE, IS WHAT THIS REPORT IS ALL ABOUT.
<H2>Don't Ignore The Market!</H2>

<P>
There are two distinct aspects in investing that should never
be forgotten. The first is market timing. Never, never, never
invest in stocks until you have established that the market direction
is up. This is of prime importance. NO MATTER HOW FAVORABLE THE
FUNDAMENTAL FACTORS APPEAR FOR AN INDIVIDUAL STOCK - IT SHOULD
NOT BE PURCHASED IF THE MARKET TREND IS DOWN. When the market
is in a downtrend, all stocks, the blue chips as well as the cats
and dogs, go down together.
<P>
When you invest with the guidance of Cabot's long-term market
timing indicators, you will be fully and aggressively invested
in bull markets. That's when you'll accumulate your big profits.
But in other periods, when a defensive posture is indicated, you
will gracefully move to the sidelines with most of your funds
and wait for an improvement in the investing climate. And that's
when you'll avoid losing money!
<H2>Successful Companies.....Problem Companies</H2>

<P>
Over the years, we have given a lot of thought to the various
elements that make companies succeed and fail:  improved management,
a new or unique product, increased competition, poor cost control,
lack of new products or changing tastes and desires of customers.
And we have come to recognize companies as successes and failures.
Naturally we want to invest in successful companies and get out
of the problem companies before they are generally acknowledged
as such.
<P>
So how do you determine whether a company is a success or a failure?
The stock market! The stock market is measuring, day by day, all
of the thousands of pieces of information it receives in the form
of buy and sell orders for a given company. These bits of information
are reflected in the price of the stock faster than most investors
realize.
<P>
This information then, as it is pieced together day after day,
starts forming a momentum trend giving us the first indications
of a change in the fortunes of a given company. The study of these
changes in company fortunes (and hence stock trends) is what we
have chosen to call Momentum Analysis.
<H2>Companies Have Life Cycles</H2>

<P>
Here's another way of looking at it. All living things have life
cycles. They grow, mature and then finally die. We see this all
around us in many different forms: in flowers, animals, trees
and people. BUT WE ALSO SEE IT IN ORGANIZATIONS. Organizations
grow and mature. They develop strengths and weaknesses for a variety
of reasons. And many of them die, either through bankruptcy or
merger. 
<P>
The manner in which a company gains or loses momentum can be the
result of a few major inputs or dozens of subtle inputs. Positive
inputs might arrive in the form of improved top management, increased
demand for the company's product or even improved manufacturing
efficiencies. Negative inputs could materialize in the form of
poor cost controls, increased competition or the lack of new products.
Frequently, the reason for the change in momentum is not at all
obvious to many at the time it's happening.
<P>
The typical investor receives many conflicting stories concerning
the company in which it has an interest. And he has an extremely
difficult time establishing the real story. Take IBM, for example,
when the stock's momentum turned down in 1985 at a price of 130.
At the time everything seemed wonderful. By the time the correct
story was available to the investor, the stock had plummeted to
50. Similar experiences could be cited in the cases of Boeing,
U.S. Surgical, Merck and many others. These were cases where the
stock's momentum turned down many months before the unfavorable
fundamental story was available to the public.
<H2>Why Momentum Analysis Works</H2>

<P>
YOU CAN'T HIDE A COMPANY'S RECENT PROBLEMS OR ITS NEW SUCCESSES
UNDER A BUSHEL BASKET!!! As soon as a significant change (for
the better or worse) takes place, it is bound to be reflected
in the price of the stock. And remember, it doesn't have to be
headline news. It might not even be reported to the press. But
slowly and surely, the actions of knowing investors will result
in the stock's momentum being affected.....for better or worse.
More often than not, this change in momentum is the forerunner
of a significant change in stock prices.
<H2>Measuring Momentum</H2>

<P>
Cabot uses a graphical tool called Relative Performance (RP) to
measure the action of a stock. Relative performance continually
answers the question: &quot;How is my stock doing when compared
to the market as a whole?&quot;
<P>
The stocks we are most interested in are those whose relative
performance lines continually and persistently move ahead on a
positive steep slope with a minimum of corrections. Of course
RP lines, like people, have their own personalities. Some are
fiery and dynamic, and others are composed and consistent. The
important feature to look for is that the RP line has an established
uptrend, and is thus outperforming the stock market as a whole.
<H2>What are the Fundamental Criteria of a Successful Company?
</H2>

<OL>
<LI>It's a small company, with sales between $20 million and $500 million.
<LI>It has a revolutionary product or service with a major benefit.
<LI>It has high barriers to competition, such as patents or market dominance.
<LI>It has large recurring income from disposable products or services.
<LI>It has excellent, innovative management.
<LI>It has no debt or little debt.
<LI>It has huge mass markets.
<LI>It has strong positive momentum.
<LI>It has growing sales and earnings.
<LI>It has substantial ownership by management.
</OL>

<H2>When Is It Time to Buy A Stock?</H2>

<P>
Don't buy a stock - even though the fundamentals look good - until
the RP line has established a strong, positive uptrend for at
least 13 weeks (one quarter). Naturally, when possible, you should
try to buy on a minor pullback of two, three or four weeks. But
this is not always possible. If the issue is particularly strong,
you may find yourself waiting a long time before the stock pulls
back.
<H2>The Advantages of Momentum Analysis</H2>

<UL>
<LI>It identifies the strongest issues, even in weak markets,
thereby assisting you in your selection process.
<LI>It provides you with STAYING POWER, the persistence to remain
with an attractive position - for several years if warranted -
rather than selling it simply because you have a profit. IT TRAINS
YOU TO SIT TIGHT AS LONG AS THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE LINE IS IN
A HEALTHY UPTREND. After all, if you know you are in a great issue,
why change?
<LI>It provides the continual monitoring required for stock market
success. It induces you to compare your holdings periodically,
and without hope or wishful thinking being a factor, it forces
you to take the necessary action. CONTINUAL VIGILANCE IS A DEFINITE
REQUIREMENT AS THE FORTUNES OF COMPANIES CONTINUALLY CHANGE THROUGH
THE MONTHS.
<LI>There is a big psychological advantage in using RP lines.
IT TRAINS YOU TO WATCH YOUR STRONG STOCKS GROW AND IT TRAINS YOU
TO HOPE THEY GROW MORE, not being fearful that you might lose
what profit you have.
<LI>It trains you to put more emphasis on the time element and
less on the absolute price. With RP lines you find yourself being
less concerned with the absolute price of your stock as long as
it recently hit new RP highs.
<LI>AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL, IT TRAINS YOU TO SELL
YOUR WEAK STOCKS - a continual weeding out process - because it
emphasizes that they are doing worse than the averages. INDEED,
IT TRAINS YOU TO FEAR THAT THE LOSS MIGHT GET LARGER. Realistically,
it places the emphasis for action where it belongs, with your
potential losers, not with your winners that are continuing to
grow.
</UL>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
In summing up these ideas we can say that the principal objective
of this Momentum Analysis approach is to keep your funds invested
at all times in the best performing stocks. If you weed out your
poorer stocks on the first sign of RP weakness, you will automatically
be cutting your losses short and at the same time letting your
profits run. This process of letting your profits run in order
to accumulate significant long-term profits is of primary importance.
