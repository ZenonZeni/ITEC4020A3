     Two-Phased Flow and Heat Transfer: The work in progress is focused on the
development of mechanistic models based on the two-fluid formulation which follows the
developing flow regimes along the flow field.  Such formulation will result in better prediction
of the two-phase flow characteristics. <p>
     The above-mentioned approach is presently under detailed mathematical formulations
and experimental verifications to predict <br>
(a) The critical two-phase flow in suddenly decompressed saturated and subcooled liquids and <br>
(b) The pressure drop in diabatic two-phase flow in vertical and horizontal flow channels. <p>

     Cooling of surfaces using liquid sprays: Experiments are being conducted to measure the
heat transfer between heated solid surfaces and impinging liquid droplets and sprays. 
Measurements are made of droplet evaporation rates using a computer based image analysis
system, the variation of surface temperature is recorded by a thin film temperature sensor, and
the dynamics of impact of a single droplet are studied by means of short duration flash
photography.  Droplets of water, hydrocarbon fuels, and liquid nitrogen have been used in the
experiments.  The results of the experiments give information useful in the design of industrial
spray cooling applications, and offer insight into the mechanism of boiling heat transfer. <p>

      Advanced laser photothermal instrumentation and measurement science applied to depth
profilometry and scanning tomographic imaging of industrial materials, is currently moving in
two distinct directions:  <br>
<ol>
<li> Analytical, numerical and experimental progress in the thermal-wave
inverse problem, producing depth-profiles of thermal diffusivity in surface-processed materials
non-destructively (e.g. metals, nuclear pressure tubes, plasma sprayed surfaces);  <br>
<li> The measurement of thermal transport properties of thin metallic samples using time-gated laser
thermal excitation and conduction heat transfer transient capture (aimed at on-line metal
manufacturing quality control);  and <br> 
<li> scanning thermal-wave imaging and tomography for near-
surface defect mapping (sub-surface imaging).

     Most fluids have a positive non-linearity inherent in their behavior.  This non-linearity
is often quantified using the so called fundamental gas derivative.  It is the positive nature of
this non-linearity that gives rise to such phenomena as compression shockwaves while
disallowing their rarefaction counterparts.  However, in some fluids there are areas of the phase
plane that exhibit a negative non-linear behavior.  These substances are referred to as BZT fluids. 
Because of the unusual thermodynamics of these fluids many kinds of typical flow phenomena
are substantially altered.  For example; BZT fluids can sustain a rarefaction shock but not a
compression shock.  There are two areas of interest concerning BZT fluids:  <br>
<ol>
<li> proving the existence of these fluids and exploring their flow behavior under a variety of conditions, and <br>
<li> investigating the possibility of using these types of fluids in typical thermal cycle applications.

     One of the most important problems in Kraft Recovery Boilers used in paper industry is
the deposition and sintering of materials on the tube banks in the upper part of the boiler. 
While theoretical studies of fluid flow and heat/mass transfer in the lower parts of the boiler
have been carried out rather extensively, little attention has so far been given to the prediction
of particulate deposition in the upper parts of such boilers.  This works aims to study the
mechanisms leading to the deposition of carry over on the steam tube banks in a Kraft Recovery
Boiler. <p>
     The mechanisms affecting the particle trajectories and their deposition are numerous and
their relative significance depends on a number of parameters including the particulate size and
the flow conditions.  In this work, a mathematical model is formulated for the prediction of the
turbulent flow, temperature, and concentration fields in flows between parallel plates.  Particle
trajectories and temperature histories are then calculated and the effects of turbulent dispersion
on the particle deposition on the plates is studied. <p>

     There is now great interest in the possibility of processing certain materials in
earth-orbiting laboratories.  Under this circumstance the gravitational intensity approaches 10-6
g.  As a result, new questions of fluid stability arise.  For example, if the two fluid phases of a
substance were present in a cylindrical container and were subjected to normal gravitational
intensity, the phases would be separated with the denser liquid phase at the bottom of the
container.  If the same system were subjected to a gravitational intensity of 10-6 g, then new
thermodynamic properties play a role in determining the configuration that the system will
adopt under equilibrium conditions.  These properties include the surface tension of the
liquid-vapour, solid-vapour and the solid-liquid interfaces.  Depending on the value of these
properties, the equilibrium configuration for the system can be one in which the liquid
completely encapsulates the vapour phase.  The research in this area concentrates on developing
methods for predicting the equilibrium configuration for such a system and on experimentally
examining these predictions.  The experiments are initially designed to be conducted on an
aircraft (KC-135) flying Keplarian parabolas, and if the experiments are successful there, then
further experiments are proposed that are to be performed during either a rocket flight or on a
space shuttle flight. <p>
