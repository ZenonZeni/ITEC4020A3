<H2>Schizophrenia: The Current Basic Science</H2>
<A HREF="#kane"><H4>by John M. Kane, M.D.</H4></A>
 <HR>
	It has been apparent from twin, family, and adoption studies that schizophrenia is a disease with important genetic factors.  The recent advances in molecular genetic technology are now permitting much more rapid and precise analysis of potential linkages between specific chromosomes or regions of chromosomes and schizophrenia.  Although there are as yet no proven linkages, there have been a number of interesting leads.  Important developments that will facilitate further progress in this area are the mapping of the entire human genome and the establishment of large national and international data bases derived from persons with schizophrenia and their families.
<P>
	The fact that schizophrenia may not be a single disease with one cause makes finding the potential genetic factors more difficult.  It is possible that environmental factors (e.g., infectious agents) and other prenatal events may contribute.  It is likely that some aspect of the brains' actual development is affected in individuals with schizophrenia.  Potential evidence for specific problems include the possible effects of "unstable genes" similar to those observed in some neurologic diseases.  In these instances, genes fail to work properly and lead to abnormalities in the way the brain develops.  Another area of possible dysfunction is the way nerve cells grow together and along the right pathways.  Investigators are beginning to identify molecules that may be important in this process and that might be altered in some way in schizophrenia.  It has also been established that brain maturation involves the "pruning" of neurons, a normal process of eliminating extra nerve cells that occurs during adolescence.  This is a process that might be abnormal in schizophrenia and, if so, would help to explain why the disease usually becomes apparent in late adolescence or early adulthood.
<P>
	Molecular genetic techniques have been applied to the "dopamine hypothesis" of schizophrenia.  Since all proven-effective antipsychotic drugs block some type of dopamine receptor, new studies now being performed are attempting to link or associate the genes coding for specific dopamine receptors and schizophrenia.  Some groups, for example, have been able to predict clozapine response from studying genetic information relating to dopamine receptors in patients treated with this drug; however, other groups have not replicated those findings.  
<P>
	The fact that multiple dopamine receptors exist has been well established. In addition, there are other receptors in the brain that may be important in the etiology and/or treatment of schizophrenia.  The serotonin receptors have received increasing attention because of clozapine's effects.  There are now at least seven subtypes of serotonin receptors that can be studied.  Other receptors that may be important include norepinephrine, GABA and NMDA.  Studies of these receptors are now contributing to the development of new generations of drugs to treat schizophrenia that will have greater or lesser effects on specific receptors.  For example, a recent study suggesting that oral glycine might improve negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia supports the possible role of the NMDA receptor.
<P>
	Studies of brain structure and function have also advanced rapidly, benefiting from new technology in imaging techniques as well as post-mortem investigations.  Studies of first-episode patients at the onset of the illness (and prior to any medication treatment) have shown differences in specific brain regions as compared to control subjects.  Now such studies are even showing possible alterations in the functioning of cell membranes.  Such membranes are involved not only in how cells communicate with each other, but also in the energy metabolism on which cell survival depends.
<P>
	Studies employing other imaging techniques have shown alterations in brain metabolism in specific regions.  In some cases these abnormalities have correlated with the severity of specific symptoms.  Investigators have also found relationships between brain imaging measures and performance on tests of memory and thinking.
<P>
	Techniques for measuring brain waves or electrical impulses in the brain have also demonstrated abnormalities that may be related to the difficulty many patients have in processing sensory inputs and integrating them with or distinguishing them from their own thoughts.
<P>
	It is apparent from the findings in genetics, imaging, neuropsychology, and neurochemistry that there are biologically based core abnormalities in schizophrenia that are in all likelihood present before the obvious onset of the disease.  The fact that the human brain is so complex and that we are probably not dealing with a single disease under the heading of schizophrenia adds to the challenge of research in this area.  Nevertheless, enormous progress is being made, and the rate of advance is likely to increase.
