KENNEDY, D'AMATO ADD LIBYA TO IRAN OIL
SANCTIONS BILL
Bill lacks the real teeth that proponents claim

The Senate on December 20 passed the Iran Oil Sanctions Act of 1995
(S. 1228), a bill sponsored by Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) to
impose discretionary sanctions on  foreign companies that invest over
$40 million in the Iranian oil industry in any year.  The bill is a
watered-down incarnation of other foreign sanctions bills advanced by
D'Amato earlier in the year, and is unlikely to be enforced frequently
enough to ignite disputes with U.S. trading partners.  In a last-minute
maneuver, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) made Libya an additional
target of the sanctions bill.

The Senate passed the bill with the blessing of the Clinton administration,
which had opposed previous D'Amato proposals to cut off all U.S. trade
with foreign companies that pursue trade with Iran. The purpose of these
proposals was to bring bout an international embargo against Iran by
forcing foreign companies to choose between trading with the U.S. and
trading with Iran.

The new bill is much narrower-both in terms of the activities that trigger
the sanctions and the sanctions themselves. The administration would be
obliged to impose at least one of the following sanctions against foreign
companies that invest over $40 million in the Iranian oil industry in one
year:

*  Denial of U.S. Export-Import Bank assistance;
* Denial of export licenses for products to be shipped to sanctioned
persons;
* Prohibition on loan assistance from U.S. financial institutions
exceeding $10 million in any 12 month period; and
* Ban on the operation of financial institutions that contribute to Iran's oil
development

According to Senator D'Amato, several major European corporations will
be affected by the measure.  These companies include but are not limited
to Repsol-Spain, Agip-Italy, Total-France, Petrofina-Belgium,
OMV-Austria, and Veba-Germany.

According to Washington, D.C. attorney Eric Hirschhorn, a partner at
Winston and Strawn, the bill represents a victory for the Clinton
administration, which can now avoid the political heat of vetoing a bill
that purports to punish terrorist states. "They were going to go off a cliff
on this one," said Hirschhorn, "this is a short drop compared from the
legislation that started.  Do I like it?  No.  It is a pointless exercise and
may cause retaliation from overseas, but it could have been a lot worse."

Here's what the bill does not do and where it has been narrowed:

* It only applies to "investments" (not just trade) of over $40 million in a
12 month period;
* It no longer denies entry into the United States of executives who work
for companies subject to the bill's sanctions; and
* It no longer prohibits the importation into the United States of items
from companies subject to sanctions

The amended version of the bill was fittingly passed on the eve of the
seventh anniversary of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland.  "Despite U.N. economic sanctions which have been
in force since 1992, the Government of Libya has refused to turn over
suspects, and the two suspects remain in Libya under the protection of
Colonel Qadhafi," said Kennedy on the Senate floor when introducing his
amendment.  As with Iran, the sanctions will not prohibit foreign
companies from doing business in Libya.

Hill sources claim that the House will consider similar legislation but
may attempt to make it stricter, most likely by lowering $40 million
trigger and by including import sanctions against any foreign company
that trades with, not just makes investments in, Iran.

But any attempts to beef up the bill may be more trouble than they are
worth. Administration sources say that though the administration was
originally not very excited about the bill, the final product is about the
type of bill they expected, and is one they will support.  Further, the
administration expects that the House version will closely resemble the
Senate bill.

CWC-FREE AT LAST!
Senate expected to ratify by late spring '96

Responding to pressure from exporters, the  Clinton administration and
the press, Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC) has agreed to consider allowing
Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty, a
ground-breaking arms control agreement that Helms has kept bottled up
for months in the Senate Foreign Relations committee, which he heads.
Helms was keeping the CWC, along with other critical foreign policy
items-like ambassadorial nominations and the START II treaty-hostage to
his plans to downsize the State Department and its affiliated agencies, the
Agency for International Development and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.  It was unclear whether Helms had secured
concessions from the Clinton administration in return for his about face.

In a brief statement, Helms asked that the treaty be placed on the Senate
calendar by May 1 unless his committee reports it out before then.
Furthermore, he pledged to begin committee hearings on the treaty in
February.  Although Helms in the past has pilloried the treaty for weak
enforcement provisions and the possibility of non-compliance by Russia,
his committee will almost certainly deliver the treaty to the Senate floor
with a recommendation for ratification.

Republican presidential front-runner Bob Dole, eager to show deft
foreign affairs leadership, promised speedy Senate action on the treaty.
Ratification, which requires approval by two-thirds of the Senate, should
be a mere formality.

Reaction from industry was swift.  "We finally got a date certain," said
Mike Walls of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA).  Fred
Webber, CMA president, applauded the move: "[t]he Senate has cleared a
major hurdle and opened the way for the United States to join 44 other
nations in ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention early next year,"
he said in a press release.  "We are, today, one step closer to realizing the
treaty's goal for a future free of chemical weapons."

BXA gearing up for implementing regulations

Imminent ratification set off sirens at the Commerce Department's
Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), which must coordinate treaty
compliance with U.S. chemical companies.  Larry Christensen, BXA's
regulatory guru, said that his reg-drafting team will step up its CWC work
in January and February. Christensen's office must churn out a set of
regulations that mirror the CWC's host record keeping and reporting
requirements.  Christensen said his goal is to finish the regulations
quickly to allow industry to gear up for compliance.  The sample
compliance forms that BXA has already circulated have drawn a
favorable response from chemical companies.

Had Helms not relinquished his control over CWC, U.S. producers would
be burdened with controls parallel to those that will be put on pariah
nations such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and North Korea.  Of equal
importance, the United States will now be a participant, rather than an
observer, on inspection teams.  United States officials will also be eligible
to hold positions on the CWC's Secretariat when it is established.

The treaty is widely recognized as one of most comprehensive arms
control agreements ever negotiated. It not only bans chemical weapons
,but also asserts strict control over the production and trade of chemical
warfare precursors, which include commonly traded commercial
chemicals used to make consumer goods such as clothing and paint. The
jurisdiction of the treaty is so broad, in fact, that its compliance
requirements bind companies that do not produce chemicals but merely
use them as inputs in manufacturing.

Politically, the newly pronounced action on CWC will save the United
States from international embarrassment-it was the United States that
initially led the charge for the treaty.  Once the Senate gives its
ratification, other countries will be sure to follow, pushing to ratification
total safely above the 65 countries needed for the treaty to enter into
force.  Currently, 43 countries have ratified the treaty.

But the challenge of ratification is trifling compared to the treaty's
calling: Stemming the spread of chemical weapons.  As calamities in the
Middle East and Japan over the past decade have shown, chemical
weapons are the equal opportunity equalizer of poor, technologically
backward terrorists and two-bit dictators the world over.  The CWC,
despite its lofty aims and well-conceived provisions, can no more hope to
stop rogues from acquiring chemical weapons precursors than to prevent
them from acquiring the rudimentary scientific expertise to convert them
into chemical weapons.  The hope, however, is that the treaty will act a
deterrent by strengthening the chorus of international condemnation of
chemical weapons.

ENCRYPTION AT A CROSSROADS-THE FIRST OF MANY
Industry calling for more liberal export criteria

Industry and government officials went at it again over encryption export
criteria this month at a December 5 meeting at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST).  After the government bureaucrats
and industry techies had said their piece, and the banter was finished, it
was not difficult to tell exactly what came out of the meeting. Though
there was an admirable exchange of thoughts and comments between
government and industry, one left the NIST center feeling that the whole
day there was a fruitless exercise with little impact on how the
government will control the export of sensitive encryption software.

According to one industry source who requested anonymity, despite the
change in the proposal's language (see last month's Practitioner for the
most recent draft), the government is basically sticking with its August 17
proposal as the answer to the matter and will not accept anything else.
"Basically, that is the deal" said the source.  The two sides will certainly
clash again before any final resolution is reached.

64 Bits Just Won't Do It

The most critical issue remains the number of key length bits that the
government will allow producers to export.  The debate centers around
requirement number seven of the government's latest draft for key
escrow encryption export criteria.  Requirement number seven reads as
follows:  "7.  The product's key escrow cryptographic functions shall use
an unclassified encryption algorithm with a key length not to exceed
sixty-four (64) bits."

Industry is becoming increasingly more insistent that the government
increase the permissible export level to at least 80 bits, if not more.  To
put all this in context, it is important to understand the industry standard
for judging encryption.  Industry generally considers 40 bit length
encryption as "weak" encryption; 64 bit encryption is "good" encryption;
and "strong" encryption is considered to be encryption key lengths of 80
bits or more.  This includes Skipjack, 80 bits, and triple DES, with
approximately 112 bits depending on which operational mode you use.
Note that since the French broke the Netscape Navigator's 40 bit
encryption system in November, 40 bit encryption has not even been
considered "weak" encryption by many.

This all brings us back to industry's request to increase the level of
encryption key length bits that can be exported.  Banks, for instance, need
to protect millions of dollars in overseas financial transactions. The
chemical and petroleum industry have similar interests.  Though the two
sides can discuss the exact procedures regarding how a key escrow agent
will interface with government law enforcement agents, and other
logistical issues, the government, the National Security Agency in
particular, will not show any public willingness to go above  64 bits.

Other problems with the 64 bit level involve issues concerning
competitiveness rather than security.  For instance, under the latest draft's
requirements, U.S. industry will be at a great competitive disadvantage
when facing competition from unescrowed systems with over 64 bits
manufactured overseas.  Moreover, there has been a greater demand for
triple DES, a feature that is prohibited under requirement number eight in
the latest draft.

At least one industry source in the know, however, indicated that
government officials have privately expressed a willingness to consider
larger symmetric encryption key lengths.  This is conditioned, of course,
that the encryption system and the accompanying escrow arrangements
are hardware-based products that are designed to make them
tamper-proof.  Trusted Information Systems (TIS), of Glenwood, MD has
requested that the government consider for export a hardware-based
system with key lengths up to 128 bits when it is accompanied with such
a tamper-proof system.  TIS claims that the government has expressed a
willingness to discuss the request, but has not gone much further than
that.

As the debate over key length intensifies, it is becoming more apparent
that 64 bits will not satisfy industry's concerns.  In any event, encryption
software producers may be well advised to take the best arrangement they
can get from the government and start marketing their products to see if
they will actually be able to sell them.

European Officials Meet to Discuss Encryption Issue

In a related development, European industry representatives and
European government officials met at a two day conference in
mid-December to devise a global encryption policy.  It was the first time
leading European business associations and government officials
discussed the growing number of encrypted electronic messages sent
internationally.  At the conference, officials analyzed the use and
safekeeping of keys to encrypted messages, and the conditions under
which governments will be allowed to access the messages.

The two sides also attempted to assign the liability in the case of misuse
or material loss  under any encryption methods.  OECD government
officials participated in the conference along with representatives of the
International Chamber of Commerce, the Business and Industry Advisory
Committee of the OECD, and information technology associations
covering Europe, Canada, Japan, and the United States.

Both U.S. government and industry officials would be well advised to
keep abreast of their European counterparts' activities.  Once all sides
have finished their bantering, any rules adopted in the United States will
need to be consistent with procedures overseas.  If U.S. criteria end up
being more liberal than other country's criteria, it will be of little use
because U.S. producers will have nowhere to sell their product.  If U.S.
criteria is too stringent, then U.S. producers will not be able to compete.

WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT (A.K.A. "NEW FORUM") TO TAKE
PLACE OF COCOM
The United States and its allies commence post cold war export control
regime

The United States and 27 other nations, on December 19 reached final
agreement on a new trade control agreement to restrict the transfer of
weapons to rogue states.  The  group includes Russia and nations of the
former Soviet Union.  The arrangement was first called the "New Forum"
when its countries announced in September that they had agreed in
principle on a regime.  But naming an international regime "New Forum"
begged the question: What do you call the treaty ten years from now?
The Old Forum, The Aging Forum, The Adolescent Forum?

This must have been on the top of the drafters' minds as they crossed the
t's and dotted the i's on the new export control regime's final declaration.
Now given the lengthy title of The Wassenaar Arrangement on Export
Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies,
the agreement will replace the now-defunct Coordinating Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM).  The agreement is known simply
as The Wassenaar Arrangement: a ten word title does not easily lend
itself to an acronym.

The length of the treaty's title was almost as long as the text of its final
declaration.  It is obvious from the declaration's few sentences that there
is more work to be done, said one administration source.  The declaration
only named the member countries and announced that each of the
countries would submit initial elements of the new arrangement to their
respective governments for approval.  The declaration also established a
preparatory committee that will begin work in January 1996.  The
Secretariat will be located in Vienna, Austria, and the first plenary
meeting will be in Vienna on April 2 and 3, 1996.

Impact for shippers

Though the administration can declare victory for the agreement, there is
little practical impact for exporters.  The agreement does not provide a
specific list of countries to whom members cannot ship goods.  Rather,
the agreement prohibits the shipment of arms and dual-use items to the
four generally recognized pariah states: Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and
Libya.  But even these seemingly politically uncontroversial parties are
not named in writing.  It is difficult to fathom member countries agreeing,
much less committing, to prohibit exports to other countries.

No list of controlled goods, well there is a list, it just is not public.

Enforcement mechanism: The Wassenaar Arrangement (one Freudian
slip and it's the Weimar Arrangement) lacks the type of system under
COCOM where member countries reviewed sensitive exports to pariah
countries.   Though this might change, there is no strong enforcement
mechanism as of yet.

State Department officials hail the agreement as a long overdue
replacement of COCOM, and as an agreement more suitable and
responsive to the post-cold war world.  The arrangement will aim to
respond to new security threats posed by rogue countries.  Indeed, a
central part of the regime is its members' commitment to stop the
acquisition of armaments and sensitive dual-use items by such countries.

Building on the lessons of the Iraq war, the Wassenaar Arrangement
seeks to prevent the accumulations of conventional arms around the
world.  "The Iraq war taught us that indiscriminate exports of
conventional weapons and sensitive dual-use technologies can pose
serious threats to our interests, foreign policy goals, and to international
security," said a State Department fact sheet.

Little burden on exporters

The Wassenaar Arrangement will require exporters to furnish little, if
any, additional information, said a State Department official.  Though
there may be some items that will require reporting in the future, for the
time being most of the information will be captured through
congressional reporting requirements, the licensing process, and
Shipper's Export Declarations.  There may be a very small set of general
license items that will have to be reported in the future. High
performance computers, for example, are one likely target of the regime's
reporting requirements.

Any new reporting requirements will be published in the Federal Register
by the Bureau of Export Administration.  These new regulations will
most likely require shippers to send in a summary of the designated items
on a periodic basis (e.g. quarterly). The Wassenaar Arrangement's
dual-use and munitions list essentially parallel U.S. law, so there is really
no need for exporters to be aware of additional lists.

The central goal of these new reporting requirements is for each member
nation to have information at its disposal to share with other member
countries.  The regime provides  a context where countries will be privy
to information to which they previously did not have access.

Administration cautiously optimistic on regime

The regime meets the Clinton administration's goals of moving forward
and beginning cooperative efforts with other countries.  Administration
officials are generally pleased with the results, though they candidly
acknowledge that they would have preferred a setup that featured
stronger restraint provisions and more mechanisms for openness and
transparency.  In any event, sources say, the Wassenaar Arrangement will
provide a context and mechanism where such matters can be debated at
greater length.  And debated they will surely be.

ANTICIPATING THE FINAL FORMAT OF NEW BXA
REGULATIONS

While it may cripple national parks and museums and delay issuance of
government paychecks and entitlements, the federal shutdown has not
blanketed the dank halls of the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
in a black haze of dormancy.  Nope, as this Practitioner goes to press,
BXA's regulations policy group is working away, churning through
interagency comments, to bring you the revised version of the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR) by January 1996, as well as trying to
hammer out the much-anticipated computer decontrol that President
Clinton announced on October 7, 1995.  Because the government is
closed and official meetings between important inter-agency players are
hamstrung, these regulatory changes are not expected in the Federal
Register before the end of the year, and may even not be out until much
later.

A sign of recent progress, however, did appear in the mailboxes of the
ever-shrinking ranks of Distribution Holders in the form of a December
15, 1995 letter from Acting Office of Export Licensing (OEL) Director
Eileen M. Albanese.  The letter authorized DL holders to adopt the major
reforms in computer export controls and raise the level of computer
eligibility on their special licenses.

Using the grouping of countries that President Clinton gave, the
following is a breakdown of how the countries will be grouped:

* Country Group A-no CTP restrictions:  Japan, U.S., Australia, Austria,
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, The
Holy See, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco,
Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, San Marino,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the U.K.;

* Group B-CTP up to 10,000 Mtops:  Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Brunei,
Chile, Colombia, The Czech Republic, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Hungary,
Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Poland, Peru, Philippines,
Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea,
Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Uruguay, Venezuela; and

* Group C-up to 2,000 Mtops, and for civil end-users only, up to 7,000
Mtops are permitted under the Distribution License, as long as shippers
meet certain conditions and the procedures are updated appropriately in
the Internal Control Program:  Afghanistan, Algeria, Andorra, Angola,
Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, India, Israel, Kuwait, Morocco,
Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates,
Vanuatu and Yemen.

These conditions are similar to the supercomputer safeguards plan from
the current regulations and are as follows:

For all three groups-(1) No physical or computational access may be
granted to nationals of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Syria,
Sudan, and Somalia.  (2) Appropriate measures and checks must be
established to ensure that physical and computational access to the
computer and computer using facility will be limited to authorized
persons.  (3) The computer may not be used for military (Weapons of
Mass Destruction), cryptography, or clandestine activities.  (4)
Appropriate monitoring of the use of the computer (any indications of
improper or unauthorized use or requests for runs will be promptly
reported to the government of the importing country).

* For Group A-No reexport outside Group A.
* For Group B and C-No reexport or intra-country transfer without prior
written authorization from the Bureau of Export Administration.
* For Group C-Security measures will be established to protect the
computer against theft or unauthorized use at all times.

The current regulations, which prevent delivery of higher level computers
for destinations not eligible in this listing for these higher level computers
without an approved individual validated license or "other appropriate
export authority," remain in effect.

This notice should provide a good hint of what the final computer
decontrol will look like.

In another harbinger of how upcoming regulations may affect exporters,
BXA on December 7 notified DL holders that the regulatory reform
effort would include the new Special Comprehensive License, which will
expand the slate products and countries eligible for special license
exports.

Deborah Kappler, head of special licensing and compliance at BXA,
noted that when the new EAR is adopted, there will no longer be several
distinct special licenses, such as the DL, the service supply license, the
project license, and so on. Instead, these licenses will be consolidated into
one Special Comprehensive License (SCL).  DL  holders should refer to
part 752 of the EAR draft, which will be effective upon publication in the
Federal Register.  No changes in action or use of current special licenses
is required for 12 months.  But after that time, holders who wish to
continue will be switched to the SCL and will have to go for a new
pre-license consultation, reapply on new forms, and submit a copy of
their Internal Control Programs.

PARIAH RESTRAINT
Sanctions and Sanctimony on the Banking Committee
by E.J. Prior and Michael Schaffer

Score one for democracy.  With a vote balance resembling the majorities
commanded by Brezhnev in the Supreme Soviet, and a public hearing
which made the politburo look like a rancorous debating society, Senator
Alfonse D'Amato's Senate Banking Committee this month took a
courageous stand, they say, against dictatorship.  Making up in
self-congratulation and blatant bandwagon opportunism for what the new
bill, sponsored by D'Amato (R-NY) and ranking committee Democrat
Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), lacks in political daring, the Banking Committee,
with the passage of the Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions Act of 1995 (S. 1228),
has further tightened the thumbscrews on a reliably crowd-pleasing foe:
Iran.

The committee's December 12 hearing was not burdened with intricate
legislative maneuvering or political nuances.  Foregoing the
number-crunching details of a traditional public mark-up, D'Amato,
Sarbanes, and the paltry two other committee members who bothered to
attend instead rushed through fifteen minutes of pro forma gushing
before adjourning in time for the Senators to listen to Israeli Prime
Minister Peres' address to Congress.  The hearing proceeded as follows:
Committee chair D'Amato inveighed against Iranian terrorism and
praised Sarbanes' assistance in crafting and pushing this crucial piece of
legislation.  Sarbanes inveighed against Iranian terrorism and praised
D'Amato's leadership on the committee.  D'Amato, digressing briefly to
inveigh against Iranian terrorism, then praised Senator Barbara Boxer
(D-CA) for her crucial assistance with the bill.  Boxer, for her part,
inveighed against Iranian terrorism before launching into an adulatory
speech about D'Amato that may even have outdone her Democratic
colleague.

This celebration of committee backslapping and groupthink was a fitting
harbinger of the uncontested December 18 Senate vote that passed the
Iran Oil Sanctions Act. Still, Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) added a
dose of drama the next day when he sponsored an amendment pulling
Libya, another oil-rich pariah, into the sanctions party.

All of this was timed perfectly to coincide with the seventh anniversary
of the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
and the same-day announcement that a Scottish businessman had been
indicted in Boston for selling over $250,000 worth of U.S. computer
equipment to Libya.  Rhetorical politics at its best: two terrorist birds
with one legislative stone.  Clearly, this is one bill whose target
constituency is unconcerned with the details, just so long as the bad guys
are getting it.

But what does all this mean for industry?  Lost in the posturing and
hoopla were the details of the bill, and what it suggests about future
government involvement in trade with politically profitable yet
economically marginal foreign targets. (Tremendously profitable China,
like Iran a dictatorship and an irresponsible world citizen, would never be
singled out for such treatment.)  Fortunately for exporters, the bill will
not require the imposition of U.S. trade sanctions against foreign
companies that do any trade-even in sweaters and garden hoses-with
Iran, as was previously contemplated. Removed from the bill were bans
on imports from any country that dealt in oil equipment with Iran, and a
ban on travel to the United States by executives of companies engaging in
such activity, two measures that would have signaled a drastic change in
American policy.  Also, the bill only penalizes those who invest more
than $40 million supporting oil refining procedures in either country over
any 12 month period.

So much for the good news.  The bill still requires the President to
impose one of four types of sanctions: Deny assistance from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank; Withhold export licenses of the foreign corporations
U.S. subsidiaries; prohibit commercial bank loans above $10 million;
and/or ban the operation of financial institutions that support oil
development projects in Iran or Libya.

The Iran Foreign Oil Sanctions Act of 1995 should alert industry that
they need to keep a watchful eye on Congress.  Though the stigma of
arguing against punishing pariah nations such as Iran and Libya could be
damaging from a public relations standpoint, industry should have
lobbied much harder against the measure, lest next time they are not so
lucky.

Senator D'Amato's stated goal-a laudable one-is to stop Iranian
terrorism. The problem is that this bill bears no relation to its fulfillment.
Instead, it will be greeted with rolled eyes by a domestic and foreign
public already cynical about U.S. policy's being subject to unpredictable
lurches to and fro at the whim of publicity-minded legislators, making
people still more unsure of what American policies really are, and less
likely to take us seriously when we do something we mean.  Usually The
Practitioner would skewer such a measure as an unreasonable
extraterritorial assertion of U.S. law that will end up hurting U.S.
industry.  But we won't waste our time on this one. That's because the
bill will be passed, signed by President Clinton and then tucked away in
the drawer of some mid-level NSC bureaucrat and forgotten for good.
The only folks that will hear about it again are the voters of New York
State, who will hear that their senator's impossible-to-implement
sanctions bill underscores his nails-man approach to Middle East
terrorism.

VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE
Third in a four-part series

The Export Practitioner has asked three leading practitioners to provide
their thoughts on four hypotheticals involving voluntary disclosure of
export violations.  Each of these individuals has asked to remain
anonymous so as not to affect cases they are handling for their respective
clients.  Their advice contains general legal guidance and should not be
construed as specific legal advice.

Subscribers are welcome to contact The Practitioner directly if they have
any specific questions regarding these essays.  The Practitioner again
thanks each of the three authors for the time and thought they have taken
in preparing these essays.

For eight years, Knowledge, Inc. a Huntsville, AL.-based computer firm
has been supplying general purpose computers to Enhanced Production
Concepts Inc. (EPCI), an Indian research firm.  When Knowledge filled
its first order to EPCI, it completed a comprehensive customer profile and
learned that EPCI was a reputable firm that assisted Indian companies
with enhancing their manufacturing operations.

Accordingly, Knowledge has made over 40 computer shipments to EPCI
since 1988 and has enjoyed a warm relationship with EPCI's principals.
Staff at the two companies routinely trade E-mail messages on topics
ranging from curry chicken and seafood gumbo to Himalayan treks and
how to buy gifts for people who have everything.  The E-mail traffic
omitted mention of export controls, for Knowledge's computer shipments
always fell under the Commerce Department's export licensing
thresholds.

However, a recent E-mail from EPCI set off the export compliance sirens
at Knowledge:  An EPCI engineer revealed that for the past three years
the company had been working on a project with the Indian government
to enhance the production of its line of Prithyi ballistic missiles.

Knowledge's export compliance officer, John Noblinders, plunged
immediately into a tizzy of panic.  He recalled the time at a 1992 BXA
seminar when Bill Clements scared him and his peers with his discussion
of Commerce's "know" controls, which require licenses for any shipment
that the exporter "knows" is destined for illicit weapons activities.
Noblinders comforted himself with the notion that he did not know about
the EPCI contract.  Then he E-mailed the entire sales staff and told them
to put on hold any new contracts with EPCI.  He got a response from the
South Asian sales manager saying that EPCI had briefed him on their
missile contract two years ago.  The manager added that some of the
recently shipped computers may have assisted with this project.

Is there a violation that merits voluntary disclosure by Knowledge, Inc.?

Essay number one

Knowledge, Inc. definitely has a problem that demands self-disclosure,
but the situation may not be as bad as its export compliance manager,
John Noblinders, believes. Clearly, Knowledge, Inc. has been violating
the Export Control Regulations by doing business with the Indian
company, Enhanced Production Concepts, Inc. (EPCI) for the past two
years, ever since Knowledge's South Asian sales manager was briefed on
the nature of EPCI's business.  Obviously, the incriminating information
passed on to the sales manager, who was an officer of Knowledge, Inc. at
the time, is the equivalent of "knowing" that EPCI was a company to
which any computers shipped would require a license, since any
knowledge gained by any officer can be imputed to the corporate entity.

Nonetheless, while low performance computers may have helped EPCI in
its design work on Prithyi ballistic missiles, it can be argued that they
were not at all integral to that work, and they did not advance the design
or production of such missiles in any unique way.  Therefore, the
self-disclosure-which should be made promptly and in full detail-could
argue that while there was a technical violation of the Export

Administration Regulations (EAR), the violation was incidental and
inconsequential.

Recent changes in the EAR/EPCI regulations recognize that not all
shipments to prohibited sites and prohibited activities are equal, that the
shipment has to in some way advance the design or production of the
proliferation-related product.  Particularly, in today's world, where
computers have been all but decontrolled (with only very high
performance supercomputers having any restrictions at all), it could
easily be argued that the computers that were shipped to EPCI over the
past two years were no more significant to the production of ballistic
missiles than other word processing and calculating devices, such as
pencils and slide rules.  While that argument may seem bizarre to those of
us who practiced export controls during the Cold War, it would be
difficult for a Government that has just decontrolled almost all computers
to almost all destinations around the world to argue that somehow these
particular low performance computers shipped by Knowledge, Inc. pose a
danger of undermining the antiproliferation objectives of the United
States Government.  This is not to claim that Knowledge, Inc. did not
violate the EAR, only that the penalty should fit the crime (which in
today's world is insignificant).

Essay number two

Knowledge, Inc. may have violated the EAR and, if so, is required to
disclose such violations to the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA)
and the Census Bureau.  Under the Enhanced Proliferation Control
Initiative, an exporter must obtain a validated license for products
otherwise eligible for general license treatment only if BXA informs the
exporter that a validated license is required because there is an
unacceptable risk of use or diversion to missile projects (15 C.F.R. sec.
778.7(C)(2)); or if the exporter "knows" that the products are destined for
a missile project listed in Supplement 6 to Part 778 (15 C.F.R. sec.
778.7(C)(1)(i)); or if the exporter "knows" that the products will be
"directly employed" in the design, development, production, stockpiling,
or use of missiles (15 C.F.R. sec. 778.7(C)91)(ii); 58 Fed. Reg. 68029,
68030 (1993)).

BXA never informed Knowledge that a validated license was required for
exports to EPCI.  The Prithyi project is listed in Supplement 6 to Part 778
but, assuming that EPCI employed the computers at EPCI's facility and
not at the Prithyi facility, the products were not "destined for" a listed
project.  Nevertheless, Knowledge may be deemed to have had the
requisite "knowledge" that EPCI's computers would be directly
employed in missile design, development, or production.  The theory of
such violation would be that Knowledge's failure to inquire after seeing a
"red flag" constituted impermissible self-blinding.  If the goods in fact
were to be directly employed in missile design, development, or
production, Knowledge would be deemed to have had knowledge and
hence to have violated the EAR by exporting the products to EPCI under
a general license.

For the past two years, Knowledge's South Asian sales manager has
known that EPCI was assisting the Prithyi missile project.  Even
assuming that the sales manager did not have actual knowledge that EPCI
was "directly employing" Knowledge's products in the project, he had
sufficient information to raise a "red flag" concerning EPCI's activities.
Because the sales manager's knowledge almost certainly would be
imputed to Knowledge, this gave rise to a duty on the part of Knowledge
to inquire further.  If EPCI in fact was using the products to enhance the
production of missiles, a violation of the EAR occurred when Knowledge
shipped computers to EPCI after the sales manager learned about EPCI's
activity on the missile project.

Knowledge has stopped exports to EPCI and hence has no prospective
duty to inquire under the "know" provision of the nonproliferation
regulations.  But Knowledge probably has a duty to inquire under another
provision of the EAR.  Section 778.5(a)(3) requires exporters to notify
BXA and other cognizant agencies upon receipt of "information which
would lead a reasonable prudent person to believe that a change of
material fact or intention [previously represented to a federal agency] has
occurred."  This requirement is separate from and additional to the
nonproliferation validated license requirements of Parts 771 and 778.

When Knowledge exported its products to EPCI, Knowledge presumably
submitted Shipper's Export Declarations (SED) to the Census Bureau
(through the Customs Service) stating that the products were eligible for
export under general license.  Although Section 787.5(a)(3), like the
nonproliferation rules, is triggered by knowledge (i.e. "has occurred")
rather than such lesser thresholds as reason to know or reason to believe,
the presence of the "red flag" could constitute "knowledge" for purposes
of this provision in the same manner as for the nonproliferation
provisions.  That is, the "red flag" information gained by the sales
manager would mean that Knowledge must inquire whether the goods
required a validated license (and thus made "general license"
representation on the SEDs inaccurate).

If the inquiry yields positive information about such use, there is a
change in previously represented material fact or intention and Section
787.5(a)(3) requires Knowledge to file an amended SED with the Census
Bureau and to also advise BXA as well.

Essay number three

The EPCI "catch-all rules" present perhaps the stickiest of all voluntary
disclosure questions.  At this point, it is not yet clear whether Knowledge,
Inc. has committed a violation, but the facts indicate a strong possibility.
The question is whether the provisions of EAR 778.7(c) (1) were
violated; did someone in Knowledge, Inc. know that they were exporting
products that would be used in a listed missile project in India or that
would be used in design, development, production, or use of missiles in
or by India.  BXA published very helpful guidance on the catch-all rule
on December 23, 1993, clarifying that one must "know" that such
activities are transpiring for such a violation to occur.  (58 Fed. Reg.
64550; knew about EPCI's missile contract, and said that some of the
recently shipped computers "may" have assisted with the project.  A
more thorough investigation is required to determine whether they were
directly employed in such missile activities and whether anyone from
Knowledge knew this.  Careful interpretation of this murky law applied
to the facts learned is in order.

Knowledge, Inc. needs to take the following basic steps:

*  place further shipments to EPCI on hold pending results of the
investigation
*  alert the general counsel, CFO, or other appropriate person pursuant to
the company's compliance program so that a decision can be made at
appropriate levels of "shared responsibility" on this delicate matter;
*conduct a more thorough investigation (under the auspices of counsel to
retain the privilege) to determine whether there have in fact been any
violations;
* set up some type of screening program so these questions can be
ferreted out in advance, not two years after they should have arisen;
* train sales and other appropriate personnel on the EPCI catch-all rules,
instructing them to refer any questions to Noblinders, as export
compliance administrators are otherwise unlikely to know about such
information to supply their screening checklists effectively.

Whether or not there was a clear violation, Knowledge, Inc., should
seriously consider whether making some sort of voluntary disclosure is
nevertheless in its best interests.  The adverse publicity from dealing with
a missile manufacture can cause much worse collateral damage to a
company's reputation and thereby its sales and even its stock
performance than the potential export control law penalties.  If the
investigation shows clearly that employed in applicable missile activities,
so there was no violation of law, a report to BXA can help demonstrate
this fact and also show concern of the "good citizen" corporation in
bringing the matter to the attention of appropriate government officials
become a cause celeb, such a disclosure and consultation could provide
useful cover for the company and put it in a better posture than having no
action.

Unfortunately, a disclosure of no violation can also have the practical
effect of putting all future sales to EPCI on hold until BXA responds with
the requested advice, which could take a very long time (years in a few
cases).  The various agencies addressing EPCI problems have not
developed a sound process for answering these hard questions in the four
and a half years that the catch-all rule has been in place if there is a
problem, but the application is unclear, or they do not want to disclose
sources and methods of intelligence gathering.  Thus, if one wants to do
business with entities like EPCI, it is often better to make your own
decisions and thoroughly document your files than to file an end-user
check with BXA and see whether they are allowed by other agencies to
provide a meaningful response.

Clearly, this is a sticky wicket.  All advice in prior hypotheticals applies.
Further advice should await discovery of all the facts, and application of
the judgments of experienced counsel based on the benefits and
detriments of disclosure versus nondisclosure as applied to that company.

FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT

BXA Enforcement Heads Declare Victory on Efforts in 1995

In 1995, the Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) set a new high
water mark for enforcement of export control regulations, according to
John Despres, BXA's chief enforcement official. Despres commended
enforcement field agents and his higher-ups in the Clinton administration
for a record year both in terms of fine totals and related convictions for
export control violations.

But what does a successful 1995 mean for '96?  For starters, BXA plans
to hire new investigators in its various field offices.  Also, enforcement
officials plan to target foreign representatives of U.S. companies with a
hard-hitting message: Just as in 1995, export control violations in 1996
will bring dire consequences for their perpetrators.

Computers and Software Remain Targets for '96

Continuing a sift begun immediately after the conclusion of the Cold
War, BXA's enforcement efforts in 1996 will focus on nonproliferation
controls.  Despite the administration's imminent liberalization of controls
on computer hardware and technology, the Office of Export Enforcement
(OEE) will ply the country's ports for diversion of computer technology
to pariah nations such as Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, all of which
remain subject to U.S. embargoes.  This claim has credibility in light of
the recent arrest and indictment of a Scottish businessman for attempting
to send computers to Libya (See related story below).

So how can enforcement agents tell the difference between a 486
computer and one that operates in thousands or tens of thousands of
MTOPS?  Simple: They compare information from computer
manufacturers with information from shippers and other sources.

Of course, no way is as good as two of the most historically tried and true
methods:  Following the money, and the anonymous tip. The first of these
has been particularly helpful, says Despres, in cases involving high-grade
encryption software.  Any party interested in purchasing such software
generally seeks a continuing relationship with its supplier. The mere fact
that encryption software may be available on the Internet as freeware is
almost meaningless.  If a company wants reliable encryption software it
will buy it from a company, not download it off CompuServe.

Voluntary Disclosure a Mitigating Circumstance

Though it may never appear in writing, OEE wants exporters to know
that it welcomes voluntary disclosures and will consider them a
mitigating factor in enforcement cases.  "There is a strong and recurrent
interest on the part of exporters to know what the advantages are for
disclosing infractions," says John Despres. "We encourage this."  In
recent years, exporters have pressed OEE for written guidance on how
voluntary disclosures will be considered. Barring a reversal of existing
policy, OEE will not issue such guidance, but Despres said that the
awards of voluntary disclosure "will be very substantial."

Frustrated by industry pleas for concrete data on mitigation levels, Frank
Deliberti, BXA's deputy assistant secretary for enforcement, pointed to
the commendable record of voluntary disclosure mitigation. "There is a
real piece of information that could put this to bed," said Deliberti. "Over
99.8% of the cases end up in a warning letter, an information letter, or a
do-nothing letter."

AES Predeparture Certification Requirement Key to Enforcement Efforts

The big hang-up for Customs' Automated Export System (AES) is the
debate over its predeparture approval procedure.  Exporters are
convinced it will hang up their shipments.  Customs, for its part, says
they have nothing to worry about.  For BXA's enforcement folks,
moreover, AES-and especially predeparture certification-is a valuable
enforcement tool.  And Deliberti notes that the threat of having shipments
held up "is nothing new, and it could still be held up based on current
regulations."

In whatever way AES is implemented, it will provide critical information,
potential leads, and answer questions for investigations in a more timely
manner.  As opposed to the current system, under which agents sift
through piles of paper SEDs, they will now have at their disposal a much
more comprehensive and timely set of information to be used in
investigations and enforcement actions.  Industry doesn't want to hear
this, and will let the government hear it vociferously once the first
shipment is unnecessarily delayed and an exporter loses business as a
result.

Scottish Businessman Stung Trying to Ship Computer to Libya

David McKeeve had no idea what he was in for when he traveled from
Scotland to Boston to clear up some paperwork problems with the Boston
seaport supervisor. McKeeve explained to the official that an October
1995 shipment of computers were destined for Cyprus or Ethiopia. After
McKeeve signed documents swearing to this, the seaport supervisor
revealed his true identity-a Customs enforcement official-and arrested
McKeeve for conspiring to export computers to Libya in contravention of
the U.S. embargo.

The indictment, unsealed on December 19, charges that McKeeve, along
with associates of his company, McNeil International, attempted to export
$335,000 worth of computers from Boston to Libya in October by
falsifying the ultimate destination of the shipments.

U.S. Attorney Donald K. Stern, who is prosecuting McKeeve, praised the
Customs Service for its action: "The Customs Service did an excellent
job in getting him back into this country, so that he cold be arrested and
face an American court." If convicted, McKeeve faces a maximum
penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $550,000.  The computer
equipment is also subject to forfeiture.

Filtration and Pumping Equipment Manufacturer Hit with Antiboycott
Violation Penalties

An administrative law judge this month affirmed Commerce Department
charges against Illinois-based Serflico, Ltd., a commercial filtration and
pumping equipment manufacturer and its President, Jack H. Berg, for 25
violations of the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration
Regulations.  Serflico was penalized $118,000, while Berg was set back
$90,000 in civil penalties.  The judge also barred Serflico for one year
from exporting to Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, the United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of
Yemen.  Mr. Berg could not be reached for comment.

The judge found that between January and July of 1989, Serflico and
Berg had violated the antiboycott prohibition by furnishing business
relationship information in responding to a boycott questionnaire from a
distributor in Iraq.  Serflico also failed to report to Commerce its receipt,
on seven different occasions, of boycott-related requests.  The antiboycott
regulations require companies to report all such requests to the
Department of Commerce or be subject to civil penalties and denial of
export privileges.  The antiboycott provisions also prohibit providing
information on a company's business relationship with a boycotted
company, or with any person known or believed to be restricted form
conducting business with a country that participates in the Arab boycott
of Israel.

LOGISTICS LOG

Harbor Maintenance Fee Collection Prohibited-But Court Stays its
Decision

The New York-based Court of International Trade will allow the Clinton
administration to continue collecting the Harbor Maintenance Fee
(HMF), a levy that it struck down in October as an unconstitutional tax
on exports, until the administration's appeal is heard.

The appeal may take years, and in the meantime exporters should follow
one of two courses to have their HMF payments refunded. First, continue
to file quarterly HMF statements and pay the appropriate fees.  Then file
for a refund in accordance with Customs' refund filing procedures.
When Customs denies this request, file a formal protest with Customs.
Once the formal request is denied, file directly with the Court of
International Trade.  Under the alternative approach, file directly with the
Court of International Trade.

In addition, the judge handling the case will entertain briefs on whether
interest should be refundable along with the fees, and, if so, when the
interest should begin accruing.  According to Munford Page Hall II, a
partner at Dorsey and Whitney in Washington, D.C., who represents an
interested party in the case, the judge will have to decide whether interest
will start accruing for the prejudgement period, the postjudgement period,
both, or neither.

AES Team Remains Unfazed by the Court's Decision

For Customs' Automated Export System (AES) Team, it is business as
usual.  Though HMF collection was once trumpeted as one of AES'
greatest benefits, Customs is moving ahead regardless of the court's
decision.  This decision is as much budgetary realpolitik as a defense of
the HMF.  AES officials are convinced that even if the court's decision is
upheld on appeal, Congress, obsessed more than ever with tax revenue,
will not tolerate the loss of HMF revenue.

To make up the difference, AES officials think that lawmakers will draft
an HMF that will withstand constitutional scrutiny.  The long-term view
is to build a system to collect fees because Customs is sure that there will
eventually be a "legislative fix," says Peter Baish, Customs' Outbound
Process Director.

Editor's Note:  Almost immediately upon announcement of the trade
court's decision, opponents of HMF universally changed its language and
began calling it HMT.  The "T" standing for tax rather than "F" for fee.
In accordance with the industry standard, and to emphasize the
Practitioner's support of the court's ruling, the Practitioner will from this
point forward use the convention HMT when discussing the issue.

AES Hints at Plan for Early '96

Customs will be conducting random checks on business travelers to
verify compliance with export controls on hand-carried items such as
laptop computers and cellular phones. The compliance checks will focus
on flights to countries where demand for high-tech products is great and
that are subject to tight U.S. export restrictions.  Customs will be
examining whether such checks are worth the effort-a determination
that will take one year to make.

Through AES, Customs will also reportedly attempt to "help" smaller and
uninformed companies prevent unintentional violations.  It remains to be
seen whether this is a public relations effort or whether Customs is being
a truly charitable government agency.  In another effort, Customs hopes
to use AES to identify odd transactions.  One place that AES will help,
explains Baish, is when there is a suspect export of, for example, farm
equipment from the Bronx to Columbia.  Having such information
available electronically rather than on a paper SED will enhance
enforcement efforts.

Discussing another long-range '96 plan, Dorleen Pilachowski of the AES
Team confirmed that Customs will attempt to include all export forms
into the AES system, such as export licenses.   The idea is to present "one
government face" to the export community, says Pilachowski.  They will
reportedly do this, however, only after a lot of inter-agency consultation.

Customs had better start consulting soon: Bill Reinsch, The Bureau of
Export Administration's chief export official, is already on record in last
month's Practitioner as saying that even though he supports the general
notion of AES, he would be against it if Customs attempts to include
license applications in the system.  "We think that a system to file export
licenses would be a bad idea," said Reinsch.

INSIDE BXA

What Shutdown?

Yes, the government is shut down and its employees furloughed until
further notice.  But as the public goes without its national parks and the
Vermeer exhibit, BXA, like the pink Energizer Bunny, just keeps going
and going and going with what is little more than a skeleton crew.  Credit
for BXA's continued operation lies squarely with its Under Secretary,
William Reinsch, who has been charged with the multiple-hat duties of
emergency export license administrator, enforcement agent, public
relations officer, etc.  If you place a call to BXA while the shutdown is
still in effect, don't be surprised if the BXA chief answers the phone too.

Nevertheless, according to Reinsch, the shutdown has had a severe
impact on export licensing.  BXA typically approves an average of 35
licenses a day at a value of  $32.5 million.  Each day they also receive
over 400 calls for information.  During the shutdown, none of that is
happening.  Additionally, 1,027 pending license applications worth $2.3
billion are in administrative limbo because they are not being acted on.
"I object in principle to holding hostages," said Reinsch in an interview,
"The President is prepared to negotiate to achieve the result everybody
wants.  [Congress'] actions are incomprehensible."

Other than licensing issues, BXA has held onto its computer personnel,
two assistant secretaries, and its enforcement agents.  BXA's enforcement
agents are deemed essential, just as any other federal law enforcement
personnel.  So your chances of sneaking unlicensed goods out of the
country are the same as they are in normal times.

The biggest change in BXA's game plan for the shutdown this month-as
compared to handling last month's shutdown-was its retention of the
11-member export regulation rewrite squad.  As the deadline for the new
Export Administration Regulations (EAR) neared, BXA went to its
official-in-the-clutch to get the job done in time for January's big
event-the exporter's Super Bowl-Update West.  With the clock running
out, BXA sent EAR veteran Larry Christensen, sidelined during last
month's shutdown, dashing onto the regulatory playing field to lead the
rewrite team to San Jose with something to show: a new EAR.

Christensen was not quite able to get the new regulations out by BXA's
initial goal of January 1, and had to bring the agency's efforts into
overtime so that participants at Update West would have a new EAR to
take home with them.  The unofficial revised goal of getting the new regs
to the Federal Register is now set for January 12.  It is not yet known
whether the EAR will be in hard copy format or on diskette.

In addition to its presentation at Update West, BXA is preparing outreach
presentations around the country to explain the new regs to exporters
(See schedule at bottom of this column).  The presentations will include
written training materials, charts, visual materials and the like.  It is yet 
to be determined if these materials will be mailed out to interested persons
or whether the parties will have to attend the presentations

In any event, the rewrite has undergone no further adjustments of great
magnitude since the  November draft version.  "There are no deal killers.
Nothing will torpedo it," said one BXA source.  According to Eric
Hirschhorn, a partner at Winston and Strawn law firm in Washington,
D.C., the new regulations will make life easier for the first-time exporter,
but they will disorient veteran exporters steeped in the arcane ways of the
long-standing regulations. Further, foreign reexporters face an even more
difficult task with the new regulations, which will not even include a
chapter to reexports, as the current regulations do.

Control List Makes Switch to EU Numbering System

The Euro trend has reached the untrendy world of export controls. As
part of an interim rule to overhaul dual-use export control regulations, the
Bureau of  Export Administration (BXA) will convert all Export Control
Commodity Numbers (ECCN) in the Commerce Control List (CCL) to
the format used by the twelve countries of the European Union.

To assist exporters in bridging the transition between the two formats,
BXA will place a "slashed-out" version of the current ECCN entries
alongside the new Euro versions. The most obvious difference between
the two versions is plain to see: The European ECCNs are one character
longer than the long-standing CCL versions. Still, the new ECCNs should
scarcely pose an intellectual challenge even for the most blockheaded
exporter. For example, the current ECCN 3A01A under the new format
will be 3A001.

In other changes to the CCL, BXA is adding entries to CCL category 10
(Miscellaneous) covering items on the International Atomic Energy List
(a.k.a. the "Trigger List"). Also, the "related controls" and "related
definitions" sections have been added to every entry. If neither applies to
a particular entry, the term "N/A" is used.

Executive Order Expedites
Licensing   Sort of

On December 5, President Clinton dusted off and then signed Executive
Order 12981, a year-old initiative that purports to streamline the
interagency processing of export license applications. "Early on, this
Administration committed itself to a broad interagency review process,
but one which provided accountability," said Bill Reinsch.  "This
Executive Order accomplishes both of those goals.  It is good for U.S.
business and the American people."

For exporters, the order promises a more responsive export control
regime, as it reduces to 90 days from 120 days the government's deadline
for reaching decisions on export license applications. If a decision is not
passed down within the deadline, the case is automatically referred to the
president for final resolution. The order's effective date is February 6,
1996.

The order allows all federal agencies access to export license applications
submitted to BXA on the condition that the agencies deliver their
recommendations within 30 days of receipt. Should they fail to issue a
recommendation, BXA may assume that they support the application.
BXA officials argue that the inclusion of all agencies in the licensing
process will protect national security, foreign policy and nonproliferation
interests.

In the event that an agency recommends denying  a license application, it
must clearly state the recommendation's statutory or regulatory basis.
The order also requires agencies to adhere to strict review deadlines.
Here's a quick look at the time frame under which agencies will have to
operate:

Within nine days of registration:
* additional information must be requested if needed
* the license must be referred interagency
* it must be Returned Without Action (RWA) in the event a license is not
needed
* an intent to deny must be issued
* classification of an item must be verified and the license must be
granted if there is no referral

Other agencies that request referrals will have only 10 days to request
additional information and 30 days to recommend approval or denial.  An
interagency review board will resolve disputes among the relevant
agencies. Under the order, a subcommittee of  the Advisory Committee
on Export Policy (ACEP), which consists of representatives of the
departments of State, Defense, Energy, and the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency, must resolve disputes over applications within 14
days. The subcommittee's decisions may be appealed to the ACEP chair,
the Under-Secretary of Export Administration, who must make a final
decision within 5 days of the decision.

If an agency fails to give its recommendation in the allotted time frame,
the agency will be considered to have no objection to the issuance or
denial of a license.  In other words, acquiescence is acceptance.

The interagency review process will need some fine tuning, however.
According to Eric Hirschhorn, former head of what is now BXA, the
order still does not apply to the Central Intelligence Agency, which is the
biggest dilatory culprit when it comes to license applications. In addition,
licenses that under the old system would be reviewed in less than 10 days
may now take longer, as various agencies get in on the act of reviewing
the dwindling number of applications submitted to BXA.


New Computer Regulations Near Completion

The computer export decontrol announced by President Clinton in
October will appear as a final rule in the Federal Register by early
February, according to BXA officials (see related article page 8).
Implementation of the decontrol has reportedly been hung up over a
dispute with Japan over whether the decontrol violates the 1991
U.S-Japan agreement to jointly regulate exports of supercomputers.
President Clinton introduced the initiative as a unilateral measure after
Tokyo balked at approving the radical level of decontrol that it set forth.
According to administration sources, however, recent negotiations with
Tokyo have patched up the differences.

BXA to Play Role in CWC Implementation

With the Chemical Weapons Convention now moving through Senator
Helms' Foreign Relations Committee (see related article page 5), BXA
will now be responsible for developing and maintaining a database of
domestic chemical production, says Bill Reinsch.  In addition, BXA will
be preparing the treaty's regulations so that exporters will be able to
prepare for the treaty's requirements.  BXA will also be responsible for
organizing the logistics for approximately 15 to 20 regular inspections
(inspections with advance notice) per year.  They expect two or three
challenge inspections (inspections without notice) per year.  The
Bureau's officials will accompany inspectors and will organize outreach
efforts.

Commerce Includes Software and Semiconductors Under General
License GLX

The Commerce Department announced on December 13 that it has
expanded eligibility for General License GLX to include commodities
such as virus protection software and semiconductor items.  The
expansion also includes mobile telephones that contain encryption
technology, a change that eliminates cumbersome validated licensing
requirements for U.S. exporters. GLX authorizes license-free exports of a
wide range of dual-use commodities for civil end-users in China, the
former republics of the former Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe.

Industry applauded Commerce's announcement.  "This modernization of
export controls on semiconductors will greatly reduce needless and costly
licensing delays and burdensome paperwork," said Thomas W.
Armstrong, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).

Producers had long claimed that such items were widely available in the
international marketplace and that U.S. restrictions hampered their efforts
to compete globally.  Statistics show that less than one-third of some 139
billion semiconductors and 33 billion integrated circuits were made in the
United States.  Mobile telephone producers-such as Motorola and
Nokia-will benefit from the change.

"This expansion of the GLX category is a prime example of our efforts to
eliminate controls that are no longer necessary and to help U.S. business
compete globally," said BXA chief Bill Reinsch.  "This expansion will
lead to new export opportunities for U.S. businesses, and increased
opportunities for U.S. businesses and increased exports mean a stronger
U.S. economy and jobs for our citizens."
