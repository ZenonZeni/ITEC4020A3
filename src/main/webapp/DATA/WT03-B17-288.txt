       The  Invisible Gardeners of America operates to provide its
members  information  on natural alternatives  to  chemicals
used  in pest control as well as information on alternatives
to  chemicals  for the homeowner, farmer and  professional.
IGA  operates  to  provide  information  via  The  Invisible
Gardener's  advice  to  his  members,  newsletters,  videos,
workshops, radio and internet web site. His advice  is  free
to  all  active  IGA  members.  IGA publishes  an  electronic
newsletter every month, 2 printed newsletters and 1  special
edition every year. Members are encouraged to visit our  web
site and download or view our newsletter online! IGA members
 can also upgrade their book free by downloading the latest
chapters from Natural Pest control or Don't Panic It's Organic
 Book due out next month. Nonmembers must pay either for
 membership or $1 or $2 per chapter (cost will be announced
 when we figure it out!).   IGA provides
members The Organic HotLine, a special phone number that you
call  to  talk directly with Andy  and  get  his
advice.  Andy  receives hundreds of calls per  month  (  not
counting  email  and  faxes). With the development  of  the
Organic  InfoBank, IGA members now can access a vast  amount
of information arranged into a easliy accessible manner. Now
you  can  help  yourself and if you still need personlized  help
send us email.

IGA also provides resources on local events services in your area.
As a IGA member, you can represent your local area and send
us information about your areas resources and we will post it on our
web site and in our printed newsletter and in our book.
Lifetime membership is only $55! ($Senior $35 with proof)<BR>


Welcome to the club!
