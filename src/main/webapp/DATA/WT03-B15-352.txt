<H2><A NAME="HDRNEW42" HREF="icsurmst.html#ToC_3">What's new in Version 4.2</A></H2>
<P>
Enhancements for this version include
additional function and programming language support, as well as
performance improvements.
<DL>
<P><DT><B>Enhanced scalability using OS/390 workload management facility
</B><DD>This support allows the Internet Connection Secure Server to establish policies to
manage application workload.
Workload management modifies the server environment to achieve
the best overall results.
Increased server throughput is achieved by using the workload
management facility to spread the total server workloads among
several multi-threaded server processes, minimizing cross-thread
serialization and removing the hard ceiling on the total number
of threads that can be started by the server.
<P><DT><B>Customized response based on requesting browser
</B><DD>Your server can now automatically
detect the type of browser making a request and
return Web information that is
appropriately formatted for the particular browser.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Counter and date/time image support for Web pages
</B><DD>You can enhance your Web pages with
a user-access counter and the date and time as graphical images.
See the section on customizing your Web site in the
<CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Enhancements to logging and generating reports on server activity
</B><DD>This version offers
a new Java Graphical User Interface (GUI).
You can log and analyze activity on your server
based on URLs, host names, methods, or return codes.  You can generate
tailored reports based on associations such as URL hits by host, host
hits by URL, return codes by URL, and methods by URL.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>HTTP Version 1.1 compliance
</B><DD>Support for HTTP now includes HTTP 1.1 compliance, which
provides for persistent connections and virtual hosts.
Persistent connections allow the server to accept multiple requests
and to send responses over the same TCP/IP connection.  Virtual
hosts allow one IP address to serve multiple files instead
of requiring different IP addresses for different files.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Expanded Common Gateway Interface (CGI) support
</B><DD>CGI support now includes the Java programming language
in addition to the other languages already supported,
such as C, REXX, and Perl.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Year 2000 support
</B><DD>The Internet Connection Secure Server makes the transition into the 21st century a smooth
conversion with reliable support for the year 2000 and beyond.
<P><DT><B>Performance improvements
</B><DD>Dramatic improvements in single and multiple processor
environments coupled with significant CPU requirement reductions
provide higher throughput and shorter response time.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Web site content rating support
</B><DD>Based on the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS),
you can use an independent rating service to rate the content of
documents served through your Web site, or you can act as a rating
service for your own or other Web sites.
Users who request the ratings can then
evaluate the Web pages for acceptable content before viewing them.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Client authentication and other enhancements to SSL support
</B><DD>The vast majority of users are choosing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) protocol for their secure transactions instead of S-HTTP, so
SSL is where we're putting our efforts as well.  We've removed S-HTTP
support in this and future versions of the Internet Connection Secure Server, and we will continue
to enhance our support of SSL.  Our support of SSL V3 now includes
client authentication, which is a security enhancement that
allows the server to verify, with a high degree of
confidence, that any client is who it says it is.  Our support of
SSL V3 also includes server authentication, data encryption, and
additional Message Digest Hashing algorithms.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>SOCKS support and SSL tunneling
</B><DD>Clients can now connect directly to a SOCKS server, instead of
using an interim server, which lowers response time.  SSL tunneling
allows the server to act as a proxy server for secure transactions.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Online access to server performance and status information
</B><DD>
Through your browser,
you can use the Server Activity Monitor to
observe performance and status information about your server and
the network.
Access log entries are also displayed.
See the section on managing your server in the
<CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Internet Connection Application Program Interface (ICAPI) support
</B><DD>Improvements include expanded diagnostic capability with additional
trace capability and additional messages.  Users may use
existing HTTP methods or tailor them to their needs.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Java servlet support
</B><DD>Java 1.0 support provides Sun Microsystems, Inc., standards
for servlets.  Servlets typically offer significant performance
enhancements over CGI programs.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Proxy authentication
</B><DD>You can set up password protection for your
proxy server independently
of the password protection at the destination server.
See the <CITE>Webmaster's Guide</CITE> for details.
<P><DT><B>Book title change
</B><DD>Our <CITE>Up and Running</CITE> books of previous releases have
been renamed <CITE>Quick Beginnings</CITE>.  The focus remains the
same:  to provide the minimal, essential information for planning for,
installing, and starting to use your server as quickly and easily
as possible.
<P><DT><B>Year 2000 support
</B><DD>The Internet Connection Secure Server smooths the transition into
the 21st century with reliable support for the year 2000 and beyond.
