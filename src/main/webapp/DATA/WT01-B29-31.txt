<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>V -- THE STRAITS SETTLEMENTS OPIUM COMMISSION<br>
</h2>

<p>FROM time to time, certain people in England apparently have
qualms as to Great Britain's opium traffic, and from time to time
questions are raised as to whether or not such traffic is morally
defensible. In February, 1909, apparently in answer to such
scruples and questionings on the part of a few, a very
interesting report was published, &quot;Proceedings of the
Commission appointed to Enquire into Matters Relating to the Use
of Opium in the Straits Settlements and the Federated Malay
States. Presented to both Houses of Parliament by Command of His
Majesty.&quot; This document may be found in the New York Public
Library and is well worth careful perusal. </p>

<p>This Commission consisted of about a dozen men, some English,
some natives of the Straits Settlements. They apparently made an
intensive and exhaustive study of the subject, carefully
examining it from every angle. Countless witnesses appeared
before them, giving testimony as to the effects of opium upon the
individual. This testimony is interesting, in that it is of a
contradictory nature, some witnesses saying that moderate opium
indulgence is nothing worse than indulgence in alcoholic
beverages, and like alcohol, only pernicious if taken to excess.
Other witnesses seemed to think that it was most harmful. The
Commission made careful reports as to the manner of licensing
houses for smoking, the system of licensing opium farms, etc.,
and other technical details connected with this extensive
Government traffic. Finally, the question of revenue was
considered, and while the harmfulness of opium smoking was a
matter of divided opinion, when it came to revenue there was no
division of opinion at all. As a means of raising revenue, the
traffic was certainly justifiable. It was proven that about fifty
per cent of the revenues of the Straits Settlements and the
Federated Malay States came from the opium trade, and, as was
naively pointed out, to hazard the prosperity of the Colony by
lopping off half its revenues, was an unthinkable proceeding. </p>

<p>The figures given are as follows. </p>

<p>1898. Revenue derived from 0pium....45.9 percent </p>

<p>1899 44.8 </p>

<p>1900 43.3 </p>

<p>1901 53.2 </p>

<p>1902 48.3 </p>

<p>1903 47.1 </p>

<p>1904 59.1 </p>

<p>1905 46. </p>

<p>1906 53.3 </p>

<p>There was one dissenting voice as to the conclusions reached
by this Opium Commission, that of a Bishop who presented a
minority report. But what are moral scruples against cold facts
that there's money in the opium trade? </p>

<p>This Commission made its report in 1909. But the opium
business is apparently still flourishing in the Straits
Settlements. Thus we read in the official Blue Book for 1917,
&quot;Colony of the Straits Settlements &quot; that of the total
revenue for the year, $18,672,104, that $9,182,000 came from
opium. What per cent is that?<br>
