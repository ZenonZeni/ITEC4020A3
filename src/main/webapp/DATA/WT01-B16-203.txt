 <i>As supermodel, actress, and mother of 3, Kelly LeBrock knows how alternative medicine can help her take charge of her family's health—and she's on the road telling other mothers about it.</i><p>

<br>


Who would have guessed that the alluring Woman in Red of film fame or the star of the "Don't hate me because I'm beautiful" Proctor & Gamble shampoo commercials would become an impassioned crusader for alternative medicine?<p>
When she's not acting or modeling, Kelly LeBrock tours the country, extolling the benefits of homeopathy for children. She tells  audiences how and why she regularly uses alternative medicine to maintain her health and that of her 3 children. In effect, her new message is a rewrite of what made her famous, but with a twist—"Don't hate me because I'm healthy."<p>
Kelly's commitment to health came out of a desire to find better medical solutions for her children. She had lost faith in antibiotics and the other drugs of conventional medicine. "We need to be taking more charge of ourselves and our children," she says. "True health should begin at home and not in the doctor's office."<p> 
Kelly knew if she wanted answers she'd have to find them herself. She did her homework and after extensive research found the solution in homeopathy. But she didn't stop with her family. To make it easier for other mothers struggling to find alternatives for treating their children's health, Kelly developed—and now actively promotes—a kit of simple but effective self-care homeopathic remedies for children. This is perhaps fitting for a woman who once thought of becoming a doctor.<p>

<b>HEALING HER DAUGHTER'S EAR INFECTIONS AT HOME</b><p>
Instead, Kelly became an internationally regarded model and then actress, appearing in The Woman in Red with Gene Wilder, Weird Science, and Hard to Kill, in which she costarred with her former husband, Steven Segal.<p> 
It was Segal who introduced her to alternative medicine. A regular user of acupuncture, Segal showed her the benefits firsthand in his own health and, when she tried it, she saw them in hers, too. Acupuncture and traditional Chinese herbs relieved the dizziness and fatigue she was experiencing from overwork. But it wasn't until Kelly had her first child that she began to rely on alternative medicine and use it as a mainstay in maintaining her family's health.<p> 
For her first few years, Kelly's daughter Anna Lisa suffered from the recurring ear infections so typical of childhood. "Like everybody else, I put her on antibiotics," says Kelly. "They didn't work, so I said, 'There has to be something else out there.'" That "something else" was homeopathy. The beauty of homeopathy is that it lends itself to both practitioner prescribing and low-dose self-care, depending on the condition involved.<p>
Kelly gave her daughter a homeopathic remedy and homemade ear drops (olive oil heated with fresh garlic). Kelly also put Anna Lisa on Acidophilus because she had learned that when there is an imbalance in the ear, it is generally due to an overgrowth of yeast in the intestines. A yeast overgrowth means there is probably a deficiency in "friendly" bacteria such as Acidophilus (necessary for intestinal health), so supplementation is prudent.<p>
Anna Lisa's ear infection cleared up quickly, she stopped getting ear infections, and her overall health and resistance improved. The experience filled Kelly with confidence in her ability to treat her children's health problems with homeopathy. When she had 2 more children, Kelly treated them also with homeopathic remedies from the start.<p> 
Today Dominic, 6, and Arissa, 3, are healthier than her firstborn, Anna Lisa, Kelly notes, which she attributes to the fact they have never had antibiotics. When any of her children start to come down with a cold, flu, fever, or sore throat, Kelly says she can usually reverse the symptoms in a day.<p> 
Recently, all the children in the local school were out sick, including Anna Lisa, now 9, who had swollen glands in her neck and a bad cold. Kelly treated her with low-dose homeopathics for one day and Anna Lisa was back in school the next, while all the other kids were still lying on their backs.<p> 
There are actually many homeopathic remedies suitable for colds, depending on the particular symptoms, but in Kelly's "Natural Medicine for Kids" kit the remedies blended together for cold symptoms are Apis Mellifica (from the common bee), Gelsemium Sempervirens (yellow jasmine), Kali Bichromicum (potassium bichromate), Pulsatilla (meadow anemone flower), and 6 others.<p>
Homeopathy also impressed Kelly in its ability to reduce fever. Arissa had a fever of 103.5°F. "I gave her Belladonna and within 20 minutes her fever was down," reports Kelly. "I know if I had given her aspirin or Tylenol instead they would have shut down the mechanism of healing in her body. Homeopathics, in contrast, actually help to stimulate the immune system." Belladonna, from the plant of the same name, is well-indicated for sudden high temperatures (over 102°F), intense thirst, and red hot face and lips—classic fever symptoms.<p>
In the process of educating herself on health and medicine, Kelly got a political education as well. She began to see the politics behind the medicine. "The American Medical Asso-ciation and the FDA have a lot to answer for," she states. "Illness and death directly related to the use of conventional drugs should be considered one of the leading diseases in the U.S. Did you know that 28% of all hospital admissions are from drug-related illnesses?"<p> 
Kelly points out: "Many people die every year due to the toxicity from medications, yet I've never heard of anyone dying from taking a homeopathic remedy. Why is it that people only turn to alternative medicine after being told orthodox medicine can no longer help? By the time homeopaths get the patient, they have to act as 'cleaning agents' to undo all the damage pharmaceuticals have done."<p>
With views such as these, it's not surprising to learn that Kelly hasn't taken her children to a conventional doctor in years. "I'm not 'pooh-poohing' doctors," she says. "Doctors have done some phenomenal things, but I think parents need to be more responsible for their children's health," and in Kelly's view, that means doing as much self-care as you safely can.<p>
Kelly credits the long-term health of her own children to homeopathy and herbs, both of which, along with love and good food, are now a consistent part of their lives. "Health is about what you put in your body," says Kelly. "I don't buy anything that isn't organic, and I will not give farmers the money to keep buying pesticides. I want some kind of environment left for my children."<p>

<b>SHARING HER MEDICAL RESEARCH WITH FRIENDS</b><p>
There is a great deal more to alternative medicine than homeopathy and Kelly has delved deeply into other options for health. With an impressive avidity, Kelly has investigated many therapies on the progressive edge of alternative medicine, such as hyperbaric oxygen, chelation, colonics, and placenta and glandular extracts. She's also visited cancer clinics to learn their alternative approaches. While on site, Kelly talked to patients conventional medicine had given up on, yet whose tumors had disappeared or shrunk to a size that no longer caused them pain.<p> 
Her research enabled Kelly to help a friend find relief for his cancer at one such clinic. According to Kelly, thanks to the alternative therapies used, the 26 tumors in his right lung and 18 tumors in his left were reduced to only 1 and 2 respectively—"basically through nutrition, diet, and herbs," says Kelly.<p>
She's seen similarly remarkable results with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. When a friend of the family became ill with a neurological disease that attacked her nervous system and left her a paraplegic within a year, the only treatment that worked was hyperbaric oxygen, or pure oxygen delivered to the body in a special pressurized chamber. She went from being wheelchair-bound to being able to walk after only 1 week of daily treatments in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.<p> 
     True to her unflagging medical curiosity, Kelly tried the chamber herself. She wanted to see if she felt any different after saturating her body with oxygen. She did. "I felt energized, my skin was alive, I felt alive."<p> 
Kelly also discovered chelation therapy in her wide-ranging research. Unfortunately, relatives of hers died of heart attacks before she was able to persuade them to get chelation, which has proved effective in improving blood circulation by helping to remove toxins. For some, new therapies are a hard sell, even if it could restore their health, she admits.<p> 
"They're all so brainwashed into surgery," Kelly says. "When people are confronted with the fact they might die, they generally go with what everybody else has done. I just went through this with a friend of mine who is 70. He had 6 bypasses. He now has back the same pains that he had before he had the bypasses. If he'd done chelation, he'd be jumping around instead."<p>
To her credit, Kelly's mother was one who did act on the health information Kelly offered her. She had had numerous surgeries over the years, including the removal of her gallbladder, and was not doing well; she was prediabetic and subject to blackouts. Kelly observes that her mother was a "very emotional person" and would be likely to respond well to homeopathy, which can balance the emotions and the body.<p> 
Through a  combination of  homeopathy, acupuncture, and Chinese herbs, Kelly's mother regained her health. That was 12 years ago and Kelly is convinced that, without these treatments, her mother would be dead by now. "She's another person—she's healthy," says Kelly.<p>
When it comes to her own health, Kelly gladly tries new approaches that her research indicates are sound. When she developed a thyroid problem, Kelly traveled to a clinic in Switzerland that specialized in treatment with bovine or sheep placenta and glandular extracts. Her treatment consisted of injections of thymus extract derived from sheep to stimulate her underfunctioning thyroid combined with the placental extract which is regarded by some as a youth serum. The approach got her thyroid back into balance.<p>
Colonics and intestinal cleansing is another topic well-researched by Kelly. "I'm a great believer in colonics," she says. "People clean their house and cars and try to 'clean' their minds, but not their bodies. A lot of disease comes from having an unclean colon. If you keep your colon empty and clean, you keep your body clean."<p> 

<b>CREATING A HEALTHY FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN</b><p>
"Health is an ongoing process, a way of life," says Kelly. She stresses the importance of caring for the mind as well as the body and advocates "taking time for yourself, to go for walks, to try and find peace in the day." For Kelly, this is often a walk in the woods on her remote ranch in the Santa Ynez Valley in Southern California.<p>
But when she leaves her ranch for her many speaking engagements, Kelly feels she is on a mission to spread the word to other mothers. There is a safe, inexpensive, and effective alternative to conventional medicine, she tells them, and that is homeopathy. Kelly worked closely with Boiron, a major manufacturer of homeopathic remedies, based in France, to develop a kit of 6 useful formulas. Kelly says she donates a portion of the profits to charity and insists that getting across the message of self-care with homeopathy is the reason she's doing all this.<p>
"It's not about making money. It's about opening the minds of mothers," she says. Getting mothers to feel comfortable about taking more charge of their children's health with nontoxic homeopathic remedies could be an important step in creating that healthy future for our children, she says.<p> 
To make things easy and comfortable for mothers, the 6 formulas in Kelly's "Natural Medicine for Kids" address common childhood ailments such as teething, fever, cold symptoms, sleeplessness, motion sickness, and bumps and bruises. As with most homeopathic remedies, the formulas come in the form of essentially tasteless little white pills in a plastic dispenser. But don't be deceived by the unassuming nature of the remedies: just a few pills will usually do the job.<p>
Kelly notes that she hears from a lot of mothers that they sometimes feel distrustful of homeopathy because they can buy it so easily over the counter. It's as if they can't believe something this easy to get can be effective. "They think if you can't get it from your doctor there must be something wrong with it. Yet homeopathy is FDA-approved. I really am passionate because I have been in their place—that of mothers not knowing and not understanding."<p>
On the whole, Kelly finds that people are more open to alternative medicine now than they were when she first began her research about 10 years ago. "They're more open because they're fed up," she says. "They're fed up with dealing with all the side effects and not feeling better." Her hope is that people will follow her example and educate themselves about the alternatives so they can "take charge of their own health and that of their children."<p>
