<h1>Glossary of some learning disabilities terms</h1>

<p><b>ACCOMMODATIONS.</b> Techniques and materials that allow individuals
with LD to complete school or work tasks with greater ease and
effectiveness. Examples include spellcheckers, tape recorders,
and expanded time for completing assignments.

<p><b>ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY.</b> Equipment that enhances the ability of
students and employees to be more efficient and successful. For
individuals with LD, computer grammar checkers, an overhead
projector used by a teacher, or the audiovisual information
delivered through a CD-ROM would be typical examples.

<p><b>ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER (ADD).</b> A severe difficulty in focusing
and maintaining attention. Often leads to learning and behavior
problems at home, school, and work. Also called Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

<p><b>BRAIN IMAGING TECHNIQUES.</b> Recently developed, noninvasive
techniques for studying the activity of living brains. Includes
brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM), computerized axial
tomography (CAT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

<p><b>BRAIN INJURY.</b> The physical damage to brain tissue or structure
that occurs before, during, or after birth that is verified by
EEG, MRI, CAT, or a similar examination, rather than by
observation of performance. When caused by an accident, the
damage may be called Traumatic Brain Injury  (TBI).

<p><b>COLLABORATION.</b> A program model in which the LD teacher
demonstrates for or team teaches with the general classroom
teacher to help a student with LD be successful in a regular
classroom.

<p><b>DEVELOPMENTAL APHASIA.</b> A severe language disorder that is
presumed to be due to brain injury rather than because of a
developmental delay in the normal acquisition of language.

<p><b>DIRECT INSTRUCTION.</b> An instructional approach to academic
subjects that emphasizes the use of carefully sequenced steps
that include demonstration, modeling, guided practice, and
independent application.

<p><b>DYSCALCULIA.</b> A severe difficulty in understanding and using
symbols or functions needed for success in mathematics.

<p><b>DYSGRAPHIA.</b> A severe difficulty in producing handwriting that is
legible and written at an age-appropriate speed.

<p><b>DYSLEXIA.</b> A severe difficulty in understanding or using one or
more areas of language, including listening, speaking, reading,
writing, and spelling.

<p><b>DYSNOMIA.</b> A marked difficulty in remembering names or recalling
words needed for oral or written language.

<p><b>DYSPRAXIA.</b> A severe difficulty in performing drawing, writing,
buttoning, and other tasks requiring fine motor skill, or in
sequencing the necessary movements.

<p><b>LEARNED HELPLESSNESS.</b> A tendency to be a passive learner who
depends on others for decisions and guidance. In individuals with
LD, continued struggle and failure can heighten this lack of
self-confidence.

<p><b>LEARNING MODALITIES.</b> Approaches to assessment or instruction
stressing the auditory, visual, or tactile avenues for learning
that are dependent upon the individual.

<p><b>LEARNING STRATEGY APPROACHES.</b> Instructional approaches that focus
on efficient ways to learn, rather than on curriculum. Includes
specific techniques for organizing, actively interacting with
material, memorizing, and monitoring any content or subject.

<p><b>LEARNING STYLES.</b> Approaches to assessment or instruction
emphasizing the variations in temperament, attitude, and
preferred manner of tackling a task. Typically considered are
styles along the active/passive, reflective/impulsive, or
verbal/spatial dimensions. 

<p><b>LOCUS OF CONTROL.</b> The tendency to attribute success and
difficulties either to internal factors such as effort or to
external factors such as chance. Individuals with learning
disabilities tend to blame failure on themselves and achievement
on luck, leading to frustration and passivity.

<p><b>METACOGNITIVE LEARNING.</b> Instructional approaches emphasizing
awareness of the cognitive processes that facilitate one's own
learning and its application to academic and work assignments.
Typical metacognitive techniques include systematic rehearsal of
steps or conscious selection among strategies for completing a
task.

<p><b>MINIMAL BRAIN DYSFUNCTION (MBD).</b> A medical and psychological term
originally used to refer to the learning difficulties that seemed
to result from identified or presumed damage to the brain.
Reflects a medical, rather than educational or vocational
orientation.

<p><b>MULTISENSORY LEARNING.</b> An instructional approach that combines
auditory, visual, and tactile elements into a learning task.
Tracing sandpaper numbers while saying a number fact aloud would
be a multisensory learning activity.

<p><b>NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION.</b> A series of tasks that allow
observation of performance that is presumed to be related to the
intactness of brain function.

<p><b>PERCEPTUAL HANDICAP.</b> Difficulty in accurately processing,
organizing, and discriminating among visual, auditory, or tactile
information. A person with a perceptual handicap may say that
"cap/cup" sound the same or that "b" and "d" look the same.
However, glasses or hearing aids do not necessarily indicate a
perceptual handicap.

<p><b>PREREFERRAL PROCESS.</b> A procedure in which special and regular
teachers develop trial strategies to help a student showing
difficulty in learning remain in the regular classroom.

<p><b>RESOURCE PROGRAM.</b> A program model in which a student with LD is
in a regular classroom for most of each day, but also receives
regularly scheduled individual services in a specialized LD
resource classroom.

<p><b>SELF-ADVOCACY.</b> The development of specific skills and
understandings that enable children and adults to explain their
specific learning disabilities to others and cope positively with
the attitudes of peers, parents, teachers, and employers.

<p><b>SPECIFIC LANGUAGE DISABILITY (SLD).</b> A severe difficulty in some
aspect of listening, speaking, reading, writing, or spelling,
while skills in the other areas are age-appropriate. Also called
Specific Language Learning Disability  (SLLD).

<p><b>SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY (SLD).</b> The official term used in
federal legislation to refer to difficulty in certain areas of
learning, rather than in all areas of learning. Synonymous with
learning disabilities.

<p><b>SUBTYPE RESEARCH.</b> A recently developed research method that seeks
to identify characteristics that are common to specific groups
within the larger population of individuals identified as having
learning disabilities.

<p><b>TRANSITION.</b> Commonly used to refer to the change from secondary
school to postsecondary programs, work, and independent living
typical of young adults. Also used to describe other periods of
major change such as from early childhood to school or from more
specialized to mainstreamed settings.
