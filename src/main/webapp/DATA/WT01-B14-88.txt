  Despite the economic weakness in the major G-7 countries, bond yields rose all over the world during the first quarter. Yet, the odds are high that there will be further monetary easing in much of continental Europe while Japanese monetary policy will probably remain on hold until at least the autumn.  

<P>

  Many pundits have suggested that the Bundesbank has delayed easing because of strong M3 growth <B>but the real reason is concern about Germany's wage negotiations.</B> Wage bargaining is now underway in the chemical, metal and construction industries while negotiations will begin next month in the banking and insurance sectors. Some of the unions are asking for 6% wage hikes and the Bundesbank wants employers to resist such demands because of the large employment losses now occurring in many German industries. (Manufacturing accounts for over a third of German GDP compared to 20% in the U.S.) If the negotiations produce moderate outcomes, the Bundesbank will probably ease further in late April or May. Monetary easing will be positive for the German financial markets but bond yields could continue to carry a large risk premium to compensate for uncertainty about the future of European monetary union. Many investors fear that Chancellor Kohl will attempt to pursue monetary union even if the key countries fail to achieve their Mastricht targets for deficit reductions. Alternative scenarios are also potentially dangerous for the markets. <B>Kohl, for example, could face so much resistance from his party and coalition partners that he would be forced to call a general election on the issue of monetary union and lose.</B> In such a scenario, a Socialist-Green coalition government could emerge at a time when Germany needs profound restructuring of its rigid labor market and costly welfare state.  

<P>

  The financial market in Tokyo were positively surprised by government reports of strong fourth quarter GDP growth. The resilience of final demand suggests that the economy has turned despite a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. The Ministry of Finance intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market during February and also used moral suasion over major players, such as multinational corporations, to discourage repatriation of capital during the final weeks of the fiscal year. As the Japanese current account surplus has fallen sharply from the levels of one year ago, the yen should be able to stay in its current trading range if the Japanese institutions resume exporting capital during April. In the second half of 1995, Japanese investors were net sellers of U.S. bonds but were large purchasers of Eurobonds as well as Australian bonds. In January, they made modest purchases of U.S. bonds but sold Australian bonds. The great uncontrollable factor for the MOF is large swings in demand for yen by hedge funds and other highly leveraged investors. Such investors borrowed yen to buy dollar bonds during late 1995 but they were startled by the weakness of the U.S. bond market and the threat of a yen rally in February. The MOF has tried to work with such investors by providing more information about its intentions but such relationship building will count for little if there is a sudden change in market perceptions of the economic outlook. The coming upturn in the U.S. economy should help to bolster confidence in the dollar and encourage more Japanese demand for U.S. securities, but sentiment towards the dollar could turn negative if the upturn produces a sharp widening of the trade deficit or a correction in the bond market so severe that U.S. equities also fall sharply. The dollar also could suffer if the opinion polls suggest the Democrats might regain control of the U.S. House.  

<P>

  To summarize, the U.S. economy appears poised for a moderate growth rebound during the next few quarters. While severe winter weather and the government shutdown have delayed completion of the inventory adjustment in many sectors, there is sufficient resilience in final sales to suggest that inventory demand will emerge as a positive growth factor during the second quarter and boost output growth to 3.0-3.5%. Such a rebound will prevent further monetary easing in the U.S. but the Fed will not tighten policy unless it perceives that growth will remain at levels high enough to push capacity utilization back towards 85.0% and revive inflationary pressures. If, by contrast, output growth returns to the 2.0-2.5% range during the autumn, monetary policy could remain on hold through year-end. The U.S. dollar should benefit from improved perceptions of the American economy but it will be vulnerable to renewed capital outflows by U.S. mutual funds as well as an inventory driven rebound in the trade deficit during the second half of the year.
