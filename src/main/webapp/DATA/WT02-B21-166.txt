<H1>Coert Olmsted's Home Page</H1>
Coert Olmsted is a Senior Programmer Analyst at the Alaska SAR Facility and a Scientific Consultant for the Arctic Region Supercomputing Center. Dr. Olmsted has a background in data analysis, numerical algorithms, geophysics, oceanography, and computer systems. His specialties include scientific computing, data management, applied mathematics, simulation, computer graphics/cartography, solar wind-magnetosphere interactions, image processing for remote sensing, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). 
<P>
He has been working at the ASF in algorithm development for SAR processing, particularly in SAR image terrain correction and SAR signal processing on parallel computers. He has written a general information document for scientific SAR users that has been well received by investigators and students in the field of SAR remote sensing. At ARSC he has been awarded a Cray University Research and Development Grant to develop a massively parallel version of Antonius Otto's fluid and MHD supercomputer codes. These projects have applications in magnetospheric simulation.
