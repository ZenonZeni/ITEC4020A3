House Small Business Panel Finishes SBA Review

     With the House Small Business Committee's
initial review of all SBA programs complete, staffers
say the committee is starting to form its own
proposals to cut the agency.
     Everything is on the table and undecided,
committee sources say, but they are hoping to release
their proposal by mid-May. Other key players will
be the Budget Committee, which sets the
authorization for the agency, and the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and
Judiciary, which divvies up the funds. The House
Small Business Committee proposal will most likely
be the starting point for legislation.
     SBA recently made its own proposal, which
would eliminate the government's subsidy for the
small business loan programs, the agency's costliest
program, and consolidate local SBA offices and
centers. These changes would reduce the agency's
fiscal year 1996 budget by almost a third, providing
nearly double what the House committee proposed.
     But it is unlikely the House Small Business
Committee will stop there. Chair Jan Meyers, R-
Kan., has repeatedly said she believes the 8(a)
program is "duplicative" with the new SDB and
price preference program created as part of last year's
federal acquisition bill. The Small Business
Investment Program has also been pointed to as a
program that could be cut, possibly privatized.
     House aides indicated the committee is concerned
about SBA's proposal to reduce the government's
subsidy loan cost to zero through increases in fees to
banks and borrowers. Several members have
worried additional loan fees would put SBA loans
out of reach of smaller businesses.
     Members, including Meyers, also voiced
concerns about an SBA plan to close local SBA
offices, which might affect their districts. The
proposal would consolidate regional offices with
their district counterpart and eliminate many local
offices, leaving most states with just one SBA office.
Due to their concerns, committee members are
working closely with SBA officials on this matter.
     If Meyers' committee rejects or pares down these
two proposals, as it seems they might, it could mean
cuts may need to be found in other SBA programs,
though no one program will yield as much savings
as the loan program.
     SBA hopes it will have a champion in freshman
Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y. and a member of the
House Appropriations Subcommittee, which has
jurisdiction over SBA funding. Forbes is a former
director of congressional affairs for SBA and
regional administrator for the Northeast Region.
Staff aides say he is a strong advocate of the agency
as a whole.

Clinton Defends Preferences, Hopes to Diffuse Anger
President May Look at Helping Non-Minorities

     Republicans and Democrats may be looking for
ways to help broaden the base of programs for the
disadvantaged, but for very different purposes.
     Republicans hope to promote economic
disadvantage over race as a better way to help lift up
poor Americans than affirmative action. The Clinton
administration appears to be hoping to deflect anger
away from affirmative action, by looking for ways to
help non-minorities.
     In a speech to the California Democratic Party,
Clinton said Democrats should not retreat on those
affirmative action programs that work, but, rather,
should look to what we can do for those hurt by
downsizing and other structural changes in the
economy.
     It was the President's first indication he may take
the initiative on affirmative action. But other reports
have implied the administration's review may call for
additional review and the creation of a bipartisan
committee to study the matter further.
     If the administration lets conservatives take the
lead, it could result in the substitution of economic
for racial preferences. Clint Bolick of the Institute for
Justice, one of the think tanks behind the GOP attack
on affirmative action, has suggested the use of
economic disadvantage-based programs and
specifically targeted aid to help expand opportunities
for those in poor areas.
     For instance, he suggested the Small Business
Administration should narrow its focus to target only
those areas of the nation, namely inner cities, where
the barriers to small business success are highest.
     But a large-scale attempt to help the poor is
unlikely when the federal government faces a
massive deficit. At a panel discussion sponsored by
the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity,
Randall Kennedy of the Harvard Law School warned
that a move to replace economic for social
disadvantage would require more money and
possibly end up unfunded.
     Michael Dyson of the University of North
Carolina said that to truly help the poor masses
would require raising taxes on the rich and increasing
the minimum wage.
     He contended that affirmative action programs
actually cost very little and their elimination would
only help the poor if funds for affirmative action
were being diverted from anti-poverty programs.
     Affirmative action opponents' suggestion to
redirect these programs to target the poor specifically
seems particularly inconsistent when Congress is in
the process of cutting anti-poverty programs,
Kennedy said.
     Kennedy and Dyson were not completely
opposed to changes in affirmative action, particularly
when it came to the subject of whichgroups should
receive such preferences. Asked whether some
distinctions should be made between new immigrant
groups and those groups, such as African Americans
and Native Americans, who suffered historically at
the hands of this nation, Dyson said he was not as
interested in preserving programs in their current
state.
     But, he added, affirmative action should not be
thrown out just because "some of the beneficiaries
are suspect."

Washington Insider

     Federal officials, at first seemingly caught off-
guard by attacks on affirmative action, are now
strongly promoting it as a sign of good business
sense. At a recent conference, Postmaster General
Marvin Runyon, head of the U.S. Postal Service,
said that supplier diversity "is good for the nation
because it gives small, developing businesses a fair
chance. Organizations with strong minority supplier
programs say these small businesses are often able
to respond better and faster to their specific needs.
Encouraging supplier diversity encourages the best
from our country."
***
     But attacks on affirmative action programs on the
state level continue. According to The Los Angeles
Times, California Governor Pete Wilson is expected
to announce the elimination of all state affirmative
action programs not mandated by state law.
Although this will not affect California's major
affirmative action programs in education, hiring, and
contracting, it will mean abolishing several state
advisory boards and councils charged with
monitoring state compliance with those laws.
     Wilson, who also backs a ballot initiative
repealing all state and local affirmative action
programs, rejected diversity initiatives in his hiring
and judicial appointments. According to the Los
Angeles Times, his overall percentage of hires and
appointments of minorities have hovered around
17%, not coming near the percentage of minorities
comprising the state's labor force (39%) or its
population (43%).
***
     Some interesting facts regarding minority set-
asides and the 8(a) program...According to a recent
study done by the SBA Office of Advocacy, the six
largest federal prime contractors receive more
government contracts than do all small, minority-,
and women-owned federal contractors. And critics
say the 8(a) program is concentrated among a few
firms...Also SBA Administrator Phil Lader and his
Deputy Cassandra Pulley, at a recent hearing, cited
the fact that only 3% of the SBA's budget and 10%
of its personnel are devoted to running the 8(a)
program.
**
     For a hearing on a relatively obscure program, a
recent House government programs subcommittee
hearing on the Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) program was unusually well-attended, noted
subcommittee chairman Rep. Peter Torkildsen, R-
Mass. The surge in spectators was explained by the
presence of a dozen SBIR program managers,
wanting to see what subcommittee members were
going to do to their program.
***
     The Energy Dept. last month named Percy
McCraney as deputy director of the Office of
Economic Impact and Diversity in charge of the
Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business
Utilization (OSDBU). McCraney is an attorney and
former college business instructor originally from
Louisiana.
***
     Where was Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., at the
recent Senate Small Business Committee hearing on
the 8(a) program? Kerry, who was the main sponsor
of the Senate 8(a) reform bill last year, did not even
make a quick appearance. The hearing set up at the
request of Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was
expected to question the whole existence of the
program, but Chairman Christopher Bond, R-Mo.,
seemed more bent on reform.
***
     The U.S. Agency for International Development
(AID) will host three one-day Business
Opportunities Conferences for small, minority-
owned, and women-owned businesses, historically
black colleges and universities, and private voluntary
organizations (PVOs) controlled by minorities and
women. The conferences will be May 3 in Miami,
Fla., and sometime in June in Indianapolis, Ind., and
Denver, Colo. The conferences will feature
workshops, counseling sessions, procurement and
subcontracting opportunities, and marketing tips on
doing business abroad. For registration information,
contact Gus Palmer, Thorpe International Inc., 202-
857-7835.
***
     NASA and Boeing Co., prime contractor for the
International Space Station, will host a small
business symposium May 18 at the Capitol Hill
Hyatt in Washington, D.C. Speakers give an
overview of the space station to date and discuss
near-term opportunities in mechanical/electrical
manufacturing, electrical/power/avionics,
mechanical/structural/thermal engineering, and
miscellaneous services. Pre-registration is required.
Contact Kevin Howard, NASA Small Business
Manager for International Space Station Alpha, 713-
280-7409.
***
     Although most congressional Republicans seem
to support continuing the Small Business
Administration's loan programs, Rep. Dick Chrysler,
R-Mich. and a member of the House Small Business
Committee, has characterized the program as
"corporate welfare". Others agree with him. The
Competitive Enterprise Institute has recently issued a
statement advocating the elimination of SBA and its
loan programs. The groups seems to reject the idea
that financial institutions are turning away small
businesses, particularly minorities and women,
because these loans don't offer the same returns as
bigger loans. Instead, they say that most of the small
businesses receiving SBA guarantees have a "poor
credit history." The group also believes SBA accepts
inadequate collateral, allowing borrowers to value the
collateral with no outside verification.

     The SBA Region VI Office in Kansas City has a
new phone number: 816-374-6380. So does the
Region III Office in King of Prussia, Pa.: 610-962-
3700.
***
     Senate Small Business Committee Chairman
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., has named Paul Cooksey,
a former SBA deputy administrator during the Bush
administration, as the committee's deputy chief
counsel. He has also served as a deputy assistant
secretary for administration at the Dept. of Treasury.
***
     Terminology watch... The Defense Dept. has a
polite way of saying that it disagrees. It uses the
word "nonconcur."

What's on your mind?

Q: My company is an SDB. Can you give me any
advice on winning subcontracts from primes?
***
A: As part of last year's Federal Acquisition
Streamlining Act, the federal government set a 5%
SDB contracting goal for all federal agencies, with
agencies negotiating subcontracting goals with
primes that can be either above or below this 5%
threshold.
     Subcontracting with primes, however, is actually
no different than contracting directly with a
government agency, except that primes may be more
motivated to work with you. Many primes are
worried about fulfilling their subcontracting goals
and, in fact, some even have problems locating
capable minority-owned firms in their particular
subcontracting niche. In some cases, primes can
even lose their contract if they cannot meet
subcontracting goals. So many primes may be quite
interested. But, just like with the federal agencies,
you will still need to provide a capabilities statement
and make a competitive bid. And, of course, not all
primes have problems finding SDBs.
     In any case, there are ways to improve your
chances for subcontracting with primes. As with all
government contracting, relationships are vital. Once
you have identified those primes that do work in
your field, call the main switchboard and ask for the
name of the person to contact. Most large primes
have a department or a person designated to help
them locate qualified small and minority businesses.
Look for the small business liaison officer or a
similar title. If they have a subcontractors list, request
to be added to it. But remember this is just a first
step.
     Because some contracts require primes to
specifically name the minority firm they will using, it
is important to make them aware of your firm early.
Try and schedule a meeting with the contact person
to give them a brief presentation of your firm's skills,
pertinent prior experience, and key personnel.
     The liaison officer will be able to give you
valuable information, such as what company
locations may need your service or product. They
can also help put you in touch with the prime's buyer
if they think you are qualified.
     Once you have successfully worked for a prime,
it will be much easier to get additional subcontracts
from the prime. So it is worth all the hard work to
get that first subcontract, even if it isn't very big.
***
Q: When will I be able to take advantage of the 10%
price preference for small disadvantaged businesses
contained in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining
Act?
***
A: The regulations, which tell government agencies
how to administer the new rules, must be in place by
October 1995. So you must wait until final rules are
in place--which could be earlier than the October
deadline, but don't count on it.

Congress Agrees to Paperwork Reduction Bill

     Before adjoining for their Easter/Passover recess,
the Senate and House approved the Paperwork
Reduction Act, clearing the measure for President
Clinton, who is expected to sign the bill.
     The bill was heavily supported by small business
lobbies, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
National Federation of Independent Businesses, and
National Small Business United. It is estimated that
small businesses spend one billion hours annually
filling out government paperwork at a cost of nearly
$100 billion.
     The legislation, which is part of the GOP Contract
with America and aims particularly to lessen the
paperwork burden on small business, will:
     * require a 10% reduction in government
paperwork for two years and 5% for four years after
that;
     * allow individuals and small businesses to
ignore paperwork requirements if the issuing agency
did not obtain public input in developing them; and
     * reauthorize for six years the Office of
Management and Budget's (OMB) Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs, which is the
primary review arm for reducing government
paperwork.
     The second and most controversial provision of
the bill would excuse the public from filling out
government forms that do not have OMB-issued
control numbers. The lack of such a number means
the federal agency issuing the form did not receive
OMB approval for the information request. If this is
the case, the public is legally excused from any fines
or repercussions as a result of not complying,
including the denial of government benefits.
     The bill is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1, once the
president signs it.

GSA May Contract Out More, Less

     The reorganization of the General Services
Administration (GSA) may result in more
contracting out for some services but less for others.
     GSA has divided its operations into 16 "business
lines" and over the next year will study each of them
for ways to save money and increase efficiency.
     The first two up for review are internal computer
operations and brokerage services.
     Computer operations include 22 data processing
centers, which are staffed largely by contractor
employees. The review found the centers to be two-
and-a-half times less efficient at data processing
compared to private industry.
     GSA spends about $65 million a year in salaries,
contracts, and equipment and facilities rent to run its
internal computer operations.
     To save money, data processing will be
consolidated into two large centers, which GSA
believes will operate more efficiently.
     Older computer equipment will be phased out
rapidly and two large computer services contracts
will be allowed to lapse in 1996 and 1997. Then,
GSA will consider if it can bring service in-house
using commercial software.
     GSA employs about 850 people in brokerage
services to manage the 7,700 buildings which the
agency owns or rents space in for federal workers.
     The agency spends about $94 million a year to
manage $2.4 billion in property leases. About 70%
of leases are considered "small leases" for 10,000
square feet or less.
     GSA takes 200-400 days to complete a lease
transaction, and has begun a pilot program in three
regional offices to cut 100 days from that process.
     In the review, GSA will look at whether it would
be cheaper to contract out for commercial brokerage
services or to keep performing it in-house.

Audit Says Defense Unit Awarded Too Much to
8(a)s

     The Defense Construction Supply Center
(DCSC) awarded a "disproportionate share" of its
construction contracts to 8(a) firms, according to a
Defense Dept. Inspector General's audit.
     The audit looked at DCSC contract awards made
from Oct. 1, 1990 to June 30, 1994, when the center
awarded 95 construction contracts worth $27.1
million. DCSC's procurement budget for the same
period was about $2.4 billion.
     An Ohio contractor's complaint that DCSC paid
"substantially" more than fair market value for the
installation of a sprinkler system by awarding a
contract to an 8(a) firm without competition and gave
the 8(a) "preferential treatment" sparked the audit.
     Auditors determined that the contract was
awarded properly, but said DCSC concentrated its
8(a) awards in the construction industry (defined as
work under SIC Codes 15, 16, and 17) at the
expense of other firms.
     DCSC awarded 97% of the value of its
construction contracts to 8(a) firms. All but four of
the contracts awarded to 8(a)s were awarded as sole-
source contracts, which, the audit said, cost more
than contracts awarded competitively.
     For all other industries, DCSC awarded 2% of the
value of contracts to 8(a)s, the audit reported.
     Congress set the Defense Dept. a goal of
awarding a minimum of 5% of the value of contracts
to small disadvantaged businesses. DCSC, according
to the audit, established an unwritten policy of
relying on awards to 8(a)s in construction to help
achieve its 5% goal. DCSC officials told auditors
they believed it was easier to locate qualified 8(a)
firms in construction than in other industries.
     Auditors recommended that DCSC monitor its
contract awards more closely, so 8(a) awards are not
concentrated in just a few industries.
     The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), of which
DCSC is a part, said it would begin publishing a
quarterly report listing SDB awards by SIC Code.
     DLA disagreed with the audit's findings, however
DCSC has never met the 5% SDB goal and
therefore, could be argued, that DCSC should
increase its 8(a) awards to meet the goal.
     DLA also said all of DCSC's sole-source awards
followed long-established government rules. It added
that auditors did not count millions of dollars in
construction contracts the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers awarded for DCSC requirements which,
if included, would lower the share of contracts going
to 8(a)s.

SBIR Sails Through Congressional Hearing

     Except for a few minor recommendations, the
Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
program emerged from a congressional hearing
showered with laurels.
     The hearing, held by the House Small Business
government programs subcommittee, was the last in
a two-month series that examined programs
administered by the SBA.
     SBIR was lauded for creating jobs and generating
tax revenue while adding little or no extra
administrative cost. Congress created the program in
1982 and requires federal agencies with annual
research and development (R&D) budgets of more
than $100 million to devote a percentage to funding
proposals for new and innovative technologies they
solicit from small businesses. The goal of the
program is to develop a product for the commercial
marketplace.
     Subcommittee Chairman Peter Torkildsen, R-
Mass., said  he would consider just a few changes to
the SBIR program.
     Suggestions offered included:
     * reducing paperwork and developing standard
procedures for submitting and evaluating proposals;
     * reining in solicitation topics that one business
owner described as too "far out" for people to
propose a commercially viable product in SBIR's
limited time frame; and
      * designing a computer system to verify SBIR
participation and prevent duplicate awarding of
grants.
     Few cases of multiple awards for the same
proposal have been proven, but SBIR funding was
increased beginning in fiscal year 1993 and the
General Accounting Office (GAO) raised concerns
that more companies could try to take advantage of
the system. 
     SBA officials said a computer system to verify
SBIR participation much quicker than the system
now in use should be available in the next three to
four months.
     SBIR is promoted as a program that helps small
businesses develop new and useful technologies with
little government investment. It's a three-phase
process: In Phase I, companies receive up to
$100,000 over six months to see if their proposal is
viable. In Phase II, companies get up to $750,000
over two years to refine a product or service. No
government money is offered in Phase III,
commercialization.
     All grants are awarded competitively.
     Other suggestions touched on the types of
assistance agencies can offer to SBIR grant
recipients. The legislation allows agencies to provide
technical assistance, but program officials said
recipients appear to need more help in marketing
their products commercially. The Energy Dept.
created a business assistance program, funded with
non-SBIR money, to do that.
     Dr. Samuel J. Barish, the Energy Dept. SBIR
program manager, recommended that a small
percentage of SBIR money, possibly 1%, be
permitted for business development assistance. This
would require an amendment to SBIR legislation.
     Rep. Cleo Fields, D-La., asked about minority
participation in SBIR programs. No recent studies
have been done, but SBA officials said they believe
minorities are underrepresented as a whole, receiving
about 10% of SBIR awards. GAO backed up SBA's
estimate.

DOE Awards Contract to Run Rocky Flats
     Small Business to Get 15% of Contract's Value

     Small and minority-owned businesses will win
more than a half-billion dollars from a major new
Energy Dept. contract.
     DOE earlier this month awarded a $3.5-billion,
five-year contract to Kaiser-Hill Co. for cleanup of a
former nuclear weapons plant at Rocky Flats, in
Golden, Col.
     Kaiser-Hill, a joint venture between ICF Kaiser
and CH2M Hill, two leading environmental
management companies, will take over the Rocky
Flats contract July 1, 1995. The incumbent contractor
is EG&G Rocky Flats Inc.
     In its proposal, Kaiser-Hill set a goal of awarding
15% of the contract's total value, $525 million, to
small businesses. The company said it intends to
award at least $262 million in professional and
technical services contracts to small firms and more
than $130 million to small disadvantaged businesses.
     Kaiser-Hill's proposal beat out one submitted by
Parsons Rocky Flats Corp. and promises to save
$1.2 billion over the life of the contract. The Rocky
Flats contract was the second  awarded competitively
