<P>
Endometriosis is a disease primarily of the female reproductive
system that is often misdiagnosed, and the result of a misdiagnosis
can have devastating consequences to the sufferer. &quot;Endometriosis
is defined as the abnormal growth of endometrial cells - the same
cells that make up the lining of the uterus and are shed monthly
in the menstrual process - outside the uterus&quot; <CITE>(Schrotenboer
and Subak-Sharpe, 74).</CITE>  These wayward cells can position themselves
in the lower abdomen on areas such as the female organs and the
stomach, and occasionally they can be found in such remote places
as the lungs.  On these locations the cells act as though they
are uterine cells, adjusting to the changing hormone levels of
the menstrual cycle.  But, unlike uterine cells, they have no
passage-way out of the body so they stay where they are and continue
their cycle, causing scarring and adhesions as the body attempts
to protect itself from the harm. <CITE> (Schrotenboer and Subak-Sharpe,
et al., 74-76).</CITE>  It is estimated that 5.5 million women have endometriosis
in the United States and Canada. <CITE> (Nezhat, xi)</CITE>
<P>
Endometriosis is categorized and diagnosed in four stages
based on location(s) affected: Stage I, or minimal, disease (superficial
endometriosis, filmy adhesions); Stage II, or mild, disease (superficial
and deep endometriosis, filmy adhesions); Stage III, or moderate,
disease (superficial and deep endometriosis, filmy and dense adhesions)
and Stage IV, or severe, disease (superficial and deep endometriosis,
dense adhesions).  Even though the stages may seem similar, the
sizes and number of areas diseased indicate diagnosis.  <CITE>(Breitkopf
and Bakoulis, 59)</CITE>
<P>
Since misdiagnosis often occurs with endometriosis, a woman
should be concerned if she exhibits the symptoms associated with
the disease.  Symptoms can include pelvic pain, painful intercourse,
inability to get pregnant, atypical periods, nausea, vomiting,
exhaustion, bladder problems, frequent infections, dizziness,
painful defecation, lower backaches, irritable bowels, other stomach
problems, and low-grade fever.  These disturbances are usually,
but not always, cyclic in conjunction with menstruation.  It would
seem that these symptoms should help to ensure a proper diagnosis,
but there could be different reasons for the discomforts other
than endometriosis.  It is also important to note, at this point,
that not all women with the disease suffer from symptoms, even
in Stage IV. <CITE> (Ballweg, et al., 16) </CITE> For example, some women don't
discover that they have the disease until they try to get pregnant
and cannot, or their doctor discovers the disease's presence during
an unrelated type of abdominal surgery such as tubal ligation
(a voluntary procedure that prevents women from getting pregnant).
<P>
Even though some women with endometriosis are asymptomatic,
pain plays a large role in a significant percentage of women with
the disease.  Therefore, it is important to give special recognition
to this, at times, crippling pain.  Kay Ellen Hurlbutt, R.N.-C,
M.S.N., F.N.P., states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pain was reported to interfere in some way with all aspects
of activities of daily living.  Most frequently reported, 78 percent,
was interference with sleep.  Woman frequently reported difficulty
falling asleep because of the pain or being awakened from sleep
by the pain.  This finding is significant because fatigue tends
to potentiate the severity of pain. <CITE>(Hurlbutt, 269)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
She writes more on the pain caused by endometriosis:  A questionnaire
distributed to 100 randomly selected members of the Endometriosis
Association, and participated in by 68 of the 100, showed the
following results: pain reported by 100%;  1-2 days prior to cycle
71%; mid-cycle 47%; other times 40%; pain throughout 20%; and
intermittent pain with no pattern around 7%.  Since the onset
of pain, 81% reported pain was progressive.  The pain was mostly,
but not exclusively, abdominal. <CITE>(Hurlbutt, 268) </CITE> Not only can
this pain be tormenting, it manifests itself  in other ways:
<P>
Respondents were asked to describe their moods and feelings
when experiencing pain.  Eighty-four percent reported feeling
depressed, 75 percent irritable, 63 percent experienced mood swings,
54 percent reported feeling anxious, 53 percent angry, 51 percent
negative, 43 percent helpless, 35 percent fearful and powerless,
32 percent worried, 31 percent insecure, and 19 percent hopeless.
<CITE> (Hurlbutt, 270)</CITE>
<P>
This is one woman's experience:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I have always had problems with my periods.  Till I was diagnosed,
I never knew when I would get my period.  I would always know
how it would be.  It always lasted seven days, severe cramps,
back aches, headaches, leg cramps, bloating.  Incredibly heavy
flow, with a lot of clotting.  My gyn would only pat me on the
back and tell me I was just one of the unfortunate ones.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Endometriosis has been called <I>husbanditis</I>.  Bedridden
sufferers of the disease were thought to be refusing their husband's
affections.  These women were often treated with medications for
relaxation and to relieve their discomfort.  In more extreme cases,
they were given hysterectomies.  Today small improvement has been
made.  Despite the fact that diagnosis is more prevalent today,
it is usually found in the late stages when damage has already
been done.  Many women are still being told that their symptoms
are all in their head, and when the disease is properly diagnosed
it is usually after other physicians have missed the diagnosis
over a long period of time as told in this woman's story <CITE>(Maleskey
and Inlander, 116-117):</CITE>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
I can tell you, I went to 10 doctors and had 10 different
diagnosis until one came up with endo.  You can't believe how
relieved I was!  I had everything from a pulled muscle, to &quot;you
need to have a baby or a hysterectomy,&quot; to bladder infections,
to kidney stones, to &quot;it's just cramps,&quot; to ovarian
cysts... the list goes on.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Barbara Eck Menning, Founder of RESOLVE, The Infertility Support
Group, writes, &quot;Even though endometriosis is a disease seen
in older women, it may have been present for years, causing painful
periods.  Doctors used to pat women on the head and tell them
that menstrual discomfort was normal and a small price to pay
for eventual motherhood&quot; <CITE>(Menning, 54)</CITE>.  One woman writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Around [the age] 21 or 22, I was referred to a psychiatrist
that dealt in psychosomatic pain as my S.O. [significant other]
(at the time) and my doctor didn't see a &quot;real&quot; basis
for these new pains.  A week or so after the first psychiatrist
appointment, I had a laparoscopy [diagnostic surgery discussed
later] &quot;just to check&quot; and they found the endometriosis.
 I refused to go back to the psychiatrist now that my pain was
acknowledged as real.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There can also be financial repercussions associated with
a diagnosis of endometriosis as told by another woman:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At some point a couple of years ago I toyed with the idea
of filing a malpractice suit against that first doctor.  I'm not
a litigious money grubber.  But I have been financially hurt to
a great degree (I only had insurance off and on during those early
years: I was a college student with no insurance).  Danazol [treatment
medication] is expensive!  Biopsies are expensive!  Not to mention
that had this been caught sooner (when I knew there was something
worse wrong with me more than hemorrhoids), things might have
been different.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Looking at the presence of pain, pain with intercourse, symptoms
of pelvic inflammatory disease and/or infertility, may help gain
some insight into why endometriosis is difficult to diagnose.
<P>
Menstrual cramps are a common complaint for many women, but
it is difficult for a physician to decide just how bad the cramps
are, and what could be causing them.  Even severe pain does not
denote the presence of endometriosis.  Because of this, diagnostic
surgery to investigate cause for pain may be delayed.  <CITE>(Breitkopf
and Bakoulis, 68).</CITE>
<P>
Pain with intercourse is also difficult to diagnose, because
it is relative, can be emotional, can be physical, or it can be
all of the above.  The doctor must decide if the patient is experiencing
a change in her life such as a new partner after years in the
same relationship or some other personal anomaly. <CITE> (Breitkopf
and Bakoulis, 68-69)</CITE>
<P>
Endometriosis can be mistaken for pelvic inflammatory disease.
 Dr. Kathryn Schrotenboer writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In some instances, the signs of endometriosis may be similar
to those of pelvic inflammatory disease, a serious infection involving
the pelvic organs.  It is not unusual for a woman to undergo antibiotic
treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease and later discover that
the problem is really endometriosis.  Therefore, if a woman is
treated for pelvic inflammatory disease without improvement, she
should be examined for endometriosis.  <CITE>(Schrotenboer and Subak-Sharpe,
77-78)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The only problem with this train of thought is that if a woman
has symptoms of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) and is treated,
she may feel better leading her and her doctor to believe she
is better.  But endometriosis, as we've learned, is cyclic.  The
symptoms may pass anyway, and the patient still has not been properly
diagnosed.  Testimony from a woman with endometriosis reveals:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>During the years before my diagnosis of severe and aggressive
endometriosis, I was treated numerous times for pelvic inflammatory
disease.  My follow-up examinations always indicated that the
tenderness in my abdomen had improved and that the medications
prescribed must have worked.  However, results from my laparoscopy
revealed that I did not show any evidence of infection, past or
present.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Endometriosis can be suspected if a woman has trouble getting
pregnant, but infertility itself is a perplexing condition.  A
patient may have no physical findings, yet cannot become pregnant.
 Endometriosis is among various problems that can cause infertility.
 <CITE>(Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 69) </CITE>This is how one woman described
her experience with her doctor:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>He kept telling me I had &quot;irritable bowel&quot; syndrome.
 Then I got a positive pregnancy test - followed by 6 weeks of
bleeding.  It turned out to be a luteal cyst causing a fake hormone/positive
pregnancy test.  However, I didn't know this until a year or so
later and at the time my GP kept saying, &quot;Well at least you
know you can conceive.&quot;  I tried for another 6 months and
then went to my doctor, thumped the table and said, &quot;Why
can't I get pregnant?&quot;  Only then would he refer me on to
a gynecologist.  Within 6 weeks I had a laparoscopy and confirmed
endometriosis, adhesions and blocked tubes.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
So how do doctors diagnose endometriosis?  This question is
important because, as with any disease, early diagnosis can help
to prevent or delay its damaging affects.  There are several ways
doctors establish the presence of the disease.
<P>
Doctors may suspect endometriosis if a woman's pelvic exam
and biography indicate a possible problem. During the exam a doctor
may discover small lumps on the uterus and near the lower area
of the large bowel, and the patient may experience discomfort
when these areas are touched.  However, these symptoms can also
be signs of other non-cancerous uterine growths. <CITE>(Stewart, et
al., 649-650).</CITE>  Timing of pelvic exams is also important:
<P>
Since the symptoms of endometriosis vary considerably from
woman to woman, as do the physical manifestations, definite diagnosis
generally requires a more extensive procedure than the usual pelvic
examination.  Even so, a pelvic examination - especially at some
point during the menstrual period, when the condition is its most
exaggerated - may find typical signs pointing to endometriosis.
<CITE> (Schrotenboer and Subak-Sharpe, 77)</CITE>
<P>
Betty Jennings, R.N., C.N.M., M.S.N., contends, &quot;Pelvic
findings may be typical of endometriosis.  On the other hand,
minimal disease can result in a perfectly normal exam&quot; <CITE>(Jennings,
123).</CITE>  However, this is not always the case.  A doctor does not
always feel abnormalities characteristic of <I>Stage IV</I> endometriosis,
even when informed by the patient of symptoms being present. 
Here is one woman's story:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Turns out that I had a chocolate [blood filled] cyst inside
my left ovary and it had ruptured, tearing my ovary open in the
process.  Oddly, I had had a pelvic exam just two weeks earlier
and was pronounced just fine.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is also important for a woman to find a doctor that she
feels comfortable talking with and who will listen to her concerns
and symptoms.  However, this does not always ensure an accurate
diagnosis if the doctor does not understand the disease. For this
reason it is important that women educate themselves on their
symptoms and seek a second opinion if necessary.  The medical
community plays an important role as well:
<P>
Whenever a woman complains of abnormal cycles, several possibilities
must be considered: pregnancy with first trimester bleeding, cervical
pathology, endometrial pathology, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory
disease, coagulopathy, and hormonal imbalance resulting in dysfunctional
uterine bleeding.  After all pathology has been excluded and a
woman's overall health status ascertained, women may be reassured
as to the wide range of normal that characterizes the menstrual
cycle.  <CITE>(Betty Jennings, 107)</CITE>
<P>
(Pathology is defined in <U>Webster's New World Dictionary</U>
as the branch of medicine that deals with the nature of disease...
any abnormal variation from a sound condition.)
<P>
An ultrasound device, used vaginally by a skilled physician
or technician, can be indispensable in diagnosing large cysts
and other characteristics of progressing endometriosis.  The ultrasonic
sound waves can be projected through the pelvic area in search
of possible abnormalities.  The device can locate masses compassing
2 cm. to 18 cm.  Even though severe cases of endometriosis may
not be clear using the ultrasound due to congestion, abnormalities
will still be present.  Because implants of endometriosis can
be smaller than 2 cm., ultrasounds can miss some instances of
the disease.  <CITE>(McDonough, 258-262) </CITE> But as an inexpensive and
pain-free procedure the ultrasound, performed by a competent medical
person, is well worth the time as told here:
<P>
(Around this time [right before her diagnosis], I joined the
Endometriosis Association and was reading all I could find about
endo.)  The specialist's next appointment was in a month.  Meanwhile,
I had an ultrasound, which showed a 13 cm cyst (about 5 inches
in diameter).  The ultrasound technician must have been surprised
at how happy I was to see such a bona-fide abnormality in my body.
 It's undeniable now, I thought.
<P>
Researchers are looking into a blood test to assist in examining
women with symptoms of endometriosis.  CA-125 is a cell surface
protein found in pelvic organs that appears to be elevated in
cases of moderate or severe endometriosis.  Some studies disclaim
these findings, but as Sue Deutsch writes, work done at the Bowman
Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, found
an increased level of the protein in 73% of women with moderate
disease and 100% of women with severe endometriosis.  It was also
found that there was less CA-125 in treated cases of the disorder.
 (Deutsch, 232)  It should, however, be noted that <I>any</I>
ovarian cyst can have high levels of CA125.  Dr. Mark Perloe at
the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre believes CA125 testing
shows the most promise in cases of severe disease and in instances
where there reoccurrence of endometriosis is supected after treatment.
<P>
The laparoscope is a surgical tool that can be used for definite
diagnosis of endometriosis.  It is a slender, unbending fiber-optic
tube approximately one foot long with a lens that allows doctors
to view the pelvic cavity and surrounding areas.  Laparoscopy,
when used correctly, is usually 100% accurate in diagnosing endometriosis.<p>
 The procedure does, however, require anesthesia, some incision(s)
and a period of recuperation.  (Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 70-71)
 When discussing surgery, there is also a question as to which
method of removing the disease is more effective, excising or
lazoring, once endometriosis is found.  The patient then needs
to decide whether or not to begin hormonal therapy following a
positive diagnosis, which does have some side affects.
<P>
As seen so far, endometriosis is not an easy disease to diagnose,
and the only definite diagnosis is made though surgery.  Despite
the fact that surgery is intimidating for most people, diagnostic
laparoscopy can detect actual disease, and in the cases where
abnormalities are present, surgical correction can be done at
the same time as the procedure.  The discomfort of surgery is
usually accepted for physical evidence of symptoms:
<P>
For most women with endometriosis, simply having their case
diagnosed brings immense relief, emotionally as well as physically.
 After suffering for years from a condition with vague symptoms
and no name, patients are relieved to gain at least some understanding
of what the mysterious disorder is and to know that treatment
will alleviate some of the painful symptoms.  <CITE>(Breitkopf and Bakoulis,
85-85)</CITE>
<P>
A woman writes, &quot;Previous to surgery I was never diagnosed
as having endo.  It was a word unlike the many other diagnostic
words that had been hurled at me over the years (Ileitis, Crohn's
Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and more, many more).&quot;
<P>
The cause of endometriosis is an enigma.  It is not known
why some woman suffer with endometriosis while other woman appear
to be perfectly healthy: 
<P>
One of the most baffling things about endometriosis is that
no one knows how it starts - how or why substance resembling the
lining of the uterus and having a specific function within that
organ grows in other parts of the body where it clearly is not
needed.  This is one of the first questions most patients ask
me, and I can respond only by telling them the theories of what
may cause endometriosis.  If doctors could tell their patients
why it occurs, we would certainly be a lot closer to understanding
how to prevent and treat the condition. <CITE> (Breitkopf and Bakoulis,
39)  </CITE>
<P>
Following are theories as to why some woman are more susceptible
than others:
<P>
There is the retrograde bleeding theory.  This theory implies
that retrograde (backward) bleeding through the fallopian tubes
during menstruation causes endometriosis.  &quot;Studies today
show that women who have obstructions of the lower genital tract
that might cause menstrual &quot;back up,&quot; such as vaginal
and uterine infections, have higher rates of endometriosis than
the general population of woman&quot; <CITE>(Breitkopf and Bakoulis,
42). </CITE> But since a majority of women experience some degree of
retrograde bleeding and don't get endometriosis, this theory could
not be proven. <CITE> (Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 42-43)</CITE>
<P>
There is the change in cells theory whereby a change in cells
causes endometriosis.  Like retrograde bleeding, these changes
could be a result of chronic infections.  This theory is also
supported in the cases of men with endometriosis who were taking
large amounts of estrogen, and estrogen can cause cell changes.
 There is also more incidence of endometriosis in females whose
mothers were treated with the DES (diethylstilbestrol) hormone
during pregnancy and in women who have pain with menstruation.
 It is the elevated amount of estrogen typical in these two circumstances
that may cause endometriosis.  Research is currently being done
on other conditions that could cause cell changes.  <CITE>(Breitkopf
and Bakoulis, 45-46) </CITE>
<P>
Some researchers theorize that cell changes caused by external
chemicals can induce endometriosis.  Research has been done on
women who have had surgery, such as Cesarean, but studies were
inconclusive as to whether this exposure could cause the disease.
<CITE> (Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 46-47)</CITE>
<P>
Some researchers suggest that women with susceptible immune
systems from birth may be more vulnerable to endometriosis.  This
theory is further supported by hereditary  factors that seem consistent
with the disease.  Lyle J. Breitkopf, M.D., and Marion Gordon
Bakoulis write:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this theory ever proves true, the fact would form the &quot;missing
link&quot; in completing Sampson's retrograde bleeding theory.
 As we have suggested, if retrograde bleeding occurs in most women,
then most of them must also have a built-in mechanism that rejects
endometrial fluid outside the uterus - otherwise most women would
develop endometriosis.  <CITE>(Breitkopf and Bakoulis, 48)</CITE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Because of the emotional and physical damage caused by endometriosis,
improvements on the doctor/patient level need to be made.  Following
is one example of the complications that can result from endometriosis:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was under [surgery] for 5 hours because I had Stage IV endo
*everywhere*.  Paul [her husband] was so worried in the waiting
room because we thought I'd only be under for an hour.  Sorry
for the graphical nature of this, but my intestines were kinked
and grown to my chest wall and all my organs were *glued* together
and covered with scar tissue.  My ovaries were grown to my uterus
and completely obscured, my uterus was grown to the back wall,
my intestines were grown to my sides.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Another story resounds the importance of doctor/patient discipline:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
It's clear from the damage to my reproductive organs that
the endo had been going its route for some time.  Why couldn't
my caretakers have suspected this from the symptoms that I presented?
 Why wasn't I better informed so I would have suspected myself
that something bad could potentially be happening with my body?
 It just isn't a fair disease.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Like most diseases, endometriosis is not fair.  As we have
seen, it can rob a woman of her ability to have children, it can
cause pain that severely interrupts everyday existence, and these
heartaches are further frustrated by the numerous misdiagnoses
that appear to be almost acceptable in the medical community.
 For this reason, woman need to become more aware of their bodies
and doctors need to listen better to the symptoms of endometriosis.
 It is also vital that women take an active role in the medical
treatment they are receiving and force doctors to heed concerns.
 The more women speak out, the more powerful they become.  For
the fight against rampant misdiagnosis of endometriosis, women
must be armed with knowledge or the continued injustice served
its victims will keep the apathy alive and well.
