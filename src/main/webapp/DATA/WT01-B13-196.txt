<H3>KEMPER ROLLS OUT EXECUTIVE PLUS - A RETIREMENT PLAN SOLUTION FOR KEY
EXECUTIVES</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (November 28) - Kemper today announced the introduction of
Executive Plus, a new turnkey nonqualified deferred compensation program
for key executives that can offer a solution to the sometimes
restrictive requirements of qualified retirement plans.
<P>

"Executive Plus is a retirement option for 401(k) plan sponsors looking
to provide additional tax-deferred investing opportunities to key
executives," said Ed Miner, first vice president of Kemper's qualified
plans area. Last year's tax code changes lowered the maximum
compensation on which qualified plan benefits can be based to $150,000,
making it difficult for executives to accumulate desired retirement
assets in traditional qualified plans. Additionally, many sponsors have
had to further reduce executive 401(k) salary deferral levels below the
$9,240 limit in order to pass nondiscrimination tests.
<P>

"Under Executive Plus a participant may defer compensation on a pre-tax
basis until those dollars are needed for retirement. Contributions and
any investment earnings generally are not taxable to the participant
until they are received," Miner said. 
<P>

"In addition, the employer also may contribute to the nonqualified plan
on behalf of the participant. These contributions, as well as
compensation deferred by participants, are not tax-deductible until they
are paid to the participant, usually at retirement."
<P>

Some of the benefits of Executive Plus include:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
A flexible plan agreement
<P>

<LI>
Safe harbor model rabbi trust
<P>

<LI>
Corporate trustee services through Trust Company of America, Inc. (Not
affiliated with Kemper. The trustee services will be provided through a
separate agreement with that company.)
<P>

<LI>
Convenient contribution submission options
<P>

<LI>
Accurate and efficient record keeping through the KemFlex system
<P>

<LI>
The Kemper Mutual Fund Family
<P>

<LI>
Opportunity for current Kemper qualified plan clients to combine
nonqualified plan assets with assets in a Kemper qualified plan to
produce pricing breaks.
</UL>

<BR>

Unlike qualified plans, nonqualified programs have no contribution
dollar limits or employee coverage, eligibility or participation
requirements. As a result, their sponsors avoid complex reporting and
compliance testing necessary for qualified plans. Generally, reporting
involves only a one-time filing with the Department of Labor. Plan
adoption is easier because a sponsor avoids many of the formal set-up
requirements of a qualified plan. 
<P>

Usually, nonqualified plans are sponsored by C corporations. Because the
owners of S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships are
taxed as pass-through entities, nonqualified deferred compensation plans
do not provide effective deferral of compensation for owners of these
entities.
<P>

Program costs vary by provider but typically involve fees for legal
counsel corporate trustee services and the plan's funding mechanism. For
more information about Executive Plus, employers should talk with their
financial representative or call Kemper Sales Support at 1-800-621-5027
to order information.
