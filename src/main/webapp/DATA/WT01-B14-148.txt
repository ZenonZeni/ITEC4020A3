OPEN LETTER TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY<P>

May 2, 1996<P>

Dear friends:<P>

As an Internet user, you are no doubt aware of some of the hurdles the
federal government has put up that limit the growth and full potential of
exciting, emerging technologies.  One of the most egregious of these has
been the governmentally set limits on so-called "encryption" technologies.
 Today I am introducing a bill to address this major problem for
businesses and users of the Internet.<P> 

If the telecommunications law enacted this year is a vehicle to achieve
real changes in the ways we interact with each other electronically, my
bill is the engine that will allow this vehicle to move forward.  The bill
would promote the growth of electronic commerce, encourage the widespread
availability to strong privacy and security technologies for the Internet,
and repeal the out-dated regulations prohibiting the export of encryption
technologies.<P>

This legislation is desperately needed because the Clinton administration
continues to insist on restricting encryption exports, without regard to
the harm this policy has on American businesses' ability to compete in the
global marketplace or the ability of American citizens to protect their
privacy online.  Until we get the federal government out of the way and
encourage the development of strong cryptography for the global market,
electronic commerce and the potential of the Internet will not be
realized.<P>

The last thing the Net needs are repressive and outdated regulations
prohibiting the exports of strong privacy and security tools and making
sure that the government has copies of the keys to our private
communications.  Yet this is exactly the situation we have today.<P>

My new bill, the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era
(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996, would:<P>

- Allow for the unrestricted export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and
popular World Wide Web browsers.<P>

- Require the Secretary of Commerce to allow the unrestricted export of
other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
generally available outside the United States.<P>

- Prohibit the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
encryption policies on the domestic market and limit the authority of the
Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.<P>

Removing export controls will dramatically increase the domestic
availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security products and
encourage the use of the Internet as a forum of secure electronic
commerce. It will also undermine the Clinton Administration's "Clipper"
proposals which have used export restrictions as leverage to impose
policies that guarantee government access to our encryption keys.<P>

The Pro-CODE bill is similar to a bill I co-authored with Senator Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, except that it highlights the importance of encryption
to electronic commerce and the need to dramatically change current policy
to encourage its growth.  My bill does not add any new criminal provisions
and does not establish legal requirements for key-escrow agents.<P>

Over the coming months, I plan to hold hearings on this bill and encourage
a public debate on the need to change the Clinton Administration's
restrictive export control policies.  I will need your support as we move
forward towards building a global Internet that is good for electronic
commerce and privacy.  I look forward to working with the Internet
community, online activists, and the computer and communications industry
as this proposal moves through Congress.<P>

I'd like to hear from you, so please join me on two upcoming online events
to talk about the new bill.  The first is on America Online in the News
Room auditorium at 9 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 6.  The second will
be on Hotwired's Chat at 9 p.m. EDT on May 13.<P>

In the meantime, I need your help in supporting the effort to repeal
cryptography export controls.  You can find out more by visiting my web
page http://www.senate.gov/~burns/.  There you will find a collection of
encryption education resources that my Webmaster has assembled.  I trust
that the entire Internet community, from the old-timers to those just
starting to learn about encryption, will find this information useful.<P>

This bill is vital to all Americans, from everyday computer users and
businesses to manufacturers of computer software and hardware.  I very
much look forward to working with you on this issue.<P>

Conrad Burns<BR>
United States Senator<P>
