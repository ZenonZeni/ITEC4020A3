<BLOCKQUOTE>It is expected that research on gene therapy will progress hereafter, so that the subcommittee for confirming safety of gene therapy products has been newly organized under Biotechnology Special Session of Subcommittee of the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council. Furthermore, the former subcommittee for Confirmation under Guideline for Manufacturing Drugs by Application of Recombinant DNA Technology has been changed to Subcommittee. <P>

Contents are as follows.<P>

1.The name of Subcommittee<BR>
(1)Subcommittee for Gene Therapy Products (2)Subcommittee for Recombinant DNA Technology Application Drugs<P>

2.A mission of;<BR>
(1) Subcommittee<P>

It is to prepare the guideline for evaluating quality and safety of Gene Therapy Products and improving the guideline as technology advences. Furthermore, according to requests from companies to conduct therapy, it is to confirm whether the gene therapy products to be scheduled fits the guideline.<P>

(2) Subcommittee<P>

It is to confirm whether recombinant DNA technology application drugs fit Guideline for Manufacturing Drugs by Application of Recombinant DNA Technology according to requests from manufacture companies.<P>

(reference)<P>

1.Biotechnology Special Session<P>

It is provided in rules of Subcommittee of the Central Pharmaceutical Affairs Council that Biotechnology Special Session is to examine and consider appropriate use of Guideline for Manufacturing Drugs by Application of Recombinant DNA Technology and important matters on biotechnology concerned with pharmaceuticals. <P>

Above important matters are to prepare the guideline for evaluating quality and safety on gene therapy products before clinical study, and confirm whether gene therapy products to be scheduled fit the guideline according to requests from companies to conduct clinical trial.<P>

2.The relationship with Central Assessment Committee for Gene Therapy<P>

Central Assessment Committee on Gene Therapy is to evaluate comprehensively scientific appropriateness and ethics of a working plan for clinical study on gene therapy from the view point of an expert, when a head of a working institution to conduct gene therapy asks a opinion from the Minister of Welfare.<P>

Biotechnology Special Session is to confirm suitability of safety, manufacture method and quality of gene therapy products according to requests from companies to conduct gene therapy.<P>

"The decision of investment and financing items for fiscal 1994"<P> 

March 8, 1995<BR>
The Organization for Drug ADR Relief, R&D Promotion and Product Review (reference)<BR>
Investment and Financing Division, R&D Promotion Department Toshiaki Kondo<BR>
9F Shinkasumigaseki Bldg 3-2, 3-chome Kasumigaseki Chiyoda-ku Tokyo 100 TEL:03-3506-9541<P>

1.The Organization for Drug ADR Relief, R&D Promotion and Product Review has decided one item for investment(the amount;30 million yen) and two items for financing(the amount;45 million yen). <P>

2.These items are the results of selection from candidates applied from September 16 to 30, 1994, after careful consideration. This choice of the investment item made 12 corporations as total corporations invested by this organization which contained 11 corporations selected from fiscal 1987 to 1993. But in the cases of 2 corporations the investment should stop in March,1995 so that 10 corporations will continue from April, 1995. The choice of two financing items made 27 corporations which contained 25 selected from fiscal 1987 to 1993.<P>

3. The outline of investment item is as follows.<P>

The theme name of research; Research on gene therapy products. The name of corporation; DNAVEC Research Inc. Participating companies; Hisamitu, kyowa, Sankyo, Shionogi, Yamanouchi, Sumitomo and Tanabe.
The outline of research theme;<BR>
Gene therapy is expected very much to apply to, cancers whose usual therapies have been ineffective, and chronic diseases or hereditary diseases whose medicinal treatment have not been satisfactory and whose treatment is necessary for all one's life.<P>

This research is focusing on establishment of gene transfer method as most suitable, and making a process practicable on gene therapy against various diseases.<P>

For above purpose, this research is to develop new vectors, control method of gene expression and vectors production technology on a large scale.<P>

4. The outline of financing two items are as follows.<P>

The theme name of research; Development of drugs for IgA nephropathy. The outline of research;<BR>
This research and development is focusing on development of monoclonal antibodies against IgA nephropathy for therapy.<P>

The theme name of research; Research on desage form and efficacy on herbal medicines. This research is focusing on analysing the relationship between preparation methods and efficacies or medicinal actions in herbal medicines. <P>

5.Contents of research on gene therapy products.<P>

1)Present state and necessity;<P>

Gene therapy has been desiged as a fundamental therapy to hereditary diseases and intractable diseases, and in 1990 a first trial in the world was applied to hereditary immunodeficiency disease(adenosine deaminase deficiency disease) as therapeutics.
As a result, a dramatic efficacy was recognized so that clinical studies has been widely applied, for example, against cancers whose mortal rate is higher. In the world, more than 90 sorts of clinical studies on gene therapy were granted permission, and more than 200 cases in fact have been in force. Furthermore, hereafter, it's number is expected to increase. On the other hand, in Japan, "An expert committee on gene therapy" was established by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in October, 1991, and " Guideline of clinical study on gene therapy" was approved in April, 1993. Furthermore, "Central Assessment Committee for Gene Therapy" was established in February,1994 and possibility on application of gene therapy has been started to examine in Japanese medical institutions. In some medical institutions, applications on clinical studies using virus vectors developed by foreign venture companies were already submitted to an ethics committee in each institution.<P>

Thus, everyone expects much from gene therapy. However, a clinical study on gene therapy in Japan is following in the footsteps of the foreign countries because of using virus vectors introduced from foreign venture companies. These existing virus vectors
are unsatisfactory from the view points of cell specificity in gene transfer, the rate of gene transfer and the gene expression rate, so that it is very difficult to conduct gene therapy with a wide use.<P> 

Therefore, this research is focusing on developing new types of vector constructions on original gene therapy and their production methods, which have high efficiency and safety in order to anchor forthcoming gene therapy in Japan with a highly wide use and
high safety.<P>

2)Technical development;<P>

This is to develop new types of vectors with higher therapeutic value than existing vectors by two types of basic approaches, "study on construction of new vectors on gene therapy" and "search on reinforcing efficacy on new gene therapy.<P>

1]Study on construction of new vectors on gene therapy; This is to develop new types of vectors with gene transfer metods with target cells specificity, high transfer rate and high physical stability.<P> 

2]Search on reinforcing efficacy on new gene therapy; This is to develop control methods of gene expression on gene therapy for high rate of gene expression, organ specificity and irritability of gene expression(region, time control). It is also to conduct applied research of new therapeutic gene to reinforce remedial value. <P>

3]Study on production of new vectors on gene therapy; This is to develop production technology for above vectors on gene therapy. It is also to establish technology for quality guaranteed on gene therapy.<P>

3.Expected effectiveness;<P>

1]It is expected to develop new vectors on gene therapy with higher efficiency than existing vectors.<BR>
2]It is expected to develop new and effective therapeutic method by new gene therapy<BR>
with high efficacy, against incurable diseases, cancer or viral diseases.<BR>
3]Above results are expected to apply widely to autoimmune diseases such as chronic articular rheumatism, chronic diseases such as hyperpiesia, incurable diseases such as Alzheimer disease and senile dementia.<P>

4.Outline of new corporation;<P>

The name of corporation;DNAVEC research Inc. Corporations investing;Hisamitsu, Kyowa, Sankyo, Shionogi, Sumitomo, Tanabe and Yamanouchi. The total amount of investment;48.2 million yen, the amount invested by this organization;30 million yen.<P>
