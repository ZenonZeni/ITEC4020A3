<H2>Start-up Meeting for Completion/Extension Project</H2></CENTER>
<P>Following the A1 grading given to the proposal to complete and extend the
E3ME model by the Commission's independent evaluation committee, a start-up
meeting was held on 27-28th February 1996 in Brussels to discuss the various
areas of work.  The project is divided into seven identifiable workpackages
which are briefly described below:</P>
<H4>Workpackage 1: Completion of the `core' model</H4>
<P>This workpackage is sub-divided into three groups</P>
<UL>
<LI>Collection of data</LI>
<LI>Validation of equation parameters</LI>
<LI>Validation of base-line scenario</LI></UL>
<P>It is envisaged that this workpackage will be completed by the end of
September 1996.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 2: Extension to the new EU Member States, Norway and
Switzerland</H4>
<P>The enlargement of the EU at the start of 1995 justifies the inclusion of
the new Member States in E3ME.  This work will follow the three tasks identified
in workpackage 1.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 3: Completion of energy/environment systems</H4>
<P>It is intended that energy and emissions in E3ME be modelled using an
approach which is based more on energy and emission abatement technologies. 
This work area also includes revisiting the relationships between energy,
environment and economy.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 4: Developments and innovations in economic modelling</H4>
<P>Research will be undertaken on the supply-side of the model focusing on
output.  The introduction of forward-looking variables and solutions in E3ME is
envisaged.  Research will seek out ways of introducing limited rational
expectations behaviour in key areas of the model.  Other areas of research will
focus on completion of the international sector of E3ME, in particular the trade
equations.  The investment equations are to be extended to cover investment by
asset and new equations estimated.  The consumption equations are to be updated
with an allocation structure for private consumption by use of a more
disaggregated energy module.  Input-output coefficients are to be analysed with
the aim of endogenising the currently fixed set of coefficients in E3ME.  The
economic/institutional treatment in E3ME is to be completed with re-estimation
of economic relationships taking place.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 5: Base scenarios (by region)</H4>
<P>This workpackage involves the validation of assumptions and an assessment of
the short-term growth rates in output.  This workpackage also involves a base
case projection with validation.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 6: One-region solution</H4>
<P>The Chambre de Commerce et d'Industrie de Paris are involved in the
application of E3ME to the French economy, thus enabling the model to solve for
one region alone.</P>
<H4>Workpackage 7: User-friendly software</H4>
<P>The objective is to make E3ME easier to use.  Cambridge Econometrics is
currently investigating alternative software packages for processing of
assumptions and presentation of results.</P>

<H4>Key dates and deliverables</H4>
<P>It is intended to update the existing version of the model with new data,
parameters and a model solution (E3ME12) by the end of September 1996.  The
extension of the new member states, and incorporation of developments and
innovations in economic modelling is expected by the end of 1997, by which time
a new model solution (E3ME21) will be made available.</P>

<H2>Results from Model Simulations</H2></CENTER>
<P>A recent paper by Terry Barker and Ben Gardiner entitled `The Direct Effects
of Energy-Saving R&amp;D on International Competitiveness and Employment in the
European Union', makes use of the E3ME model.  A 10% increase in total business
R&amp;D across the EU was allocated across industries in proportion to their
energy costs.  The increase in energy-saving R&amp;D expenditure was assumed to
be financed by a reallocation of the public sector expenditure on military R&amp;D,
so that there was no change in total R&amp;D spending.  This financing was
assumed to determine the allocation across member states, so that France and the
UK, with the largest military R&amp;D budgets, would also have the largest
increases in energy-saving R&amp;D. The paper describes in detail the components
of such a policy exercise: the effect that R&amp;D in general might be expected
to have on different areas of the economy; the size of the different R&amp;D
budgets and the design of the scenarios to reallocate these budgets; and results
from the model solution showing the <I>direct</I> effect on employment and
competitiveness (both domestic and internationally) that the R&amp;D policy will
have.  The paper concludes that significant and permanent reductions in energy
demand and improvements in international competitiveness are likely if R&amp;D
budgets are switched towards energy-saving by industrial enterprises.  The
effects on employment are mixed, but overall employment is expected to be
higher.</P>
<P>The results for the EU11 are summarised in Table 2.  This shows percentage
differences from base solutions for 9 variables in E3ME for the years 2000, 2005
and 2010.  These are the <I>direct effects</I> of the extra R&amp;D.  A full
model solution would include further interaction effects, which could be twice
are large as those reported.</P>

<H2>Other E3ME Modelling Activities</H2></CENTER>
<H4>Telecommunications Project</H4>
<P>Title:   <B>Impact on employment of liberalisation/privatisation in the
Telecommunications sector.</B></P>
<P>Project number:   <B>V/CO24/94</B></P>
<P>The data and equations of E3ME are used in the project is to run a variety
of simulations to the year 2005.  The simulations look at various aspects of the
telecoms liberalisation process and their effects on industry prices,
competitiveness, and ultimately employment creation/destruction.</P>
<H4>The Internal Market and Employment Project</H4>
<P>Title:   <B>The effect of the intra-EU trade on manufacturing employment
and labour costs due to the Internal Market programme.</B></P>
<P>Project number:   <B>XV/95/42/A
</B></P>
<P>This project uses the E3ME model to analyse the effects of the Internal
Market programme (IMP) on the EU labour market.  Two interim reports and a final
report has been submitted thus far.  For the final report the baseline and
antimonde simulations were developed with research focusing on possible changes
to the modelling structure in the light of a literature review on
trade-employment linkages.  The changes mainly involve the labour-market
equations but other areas, eg trade-investment causality, were also
investigated.</P>
<H4>Fiscal Instruments Project</H4>
<P>Title:   <B>Potential impact on employment creation of fiscal instruments
(namely of a reduced VAT rate for selected sectors).</B></P>
<P>Project number:   <B>XXI/96/CB-3001</B></P>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics was awarded a contract to analyse the potential
effects of the fiscal instrumentation on employment creation.  A final report
has been submitted.  The study uses the E3ME model to establish a counterfactual
scenario, ie if the changes in taxation had not occurred, and compare this with
baseline model simulation results for employment in the UK, Italy, Belgium,
Spain and Germany.</P>
<H4>ERECO Projections</H4>
<P>Title:   <B>Europe in 2001, Economic Analyses and Forecasts</B></P>
<P>The E3ME model was used to provide an initial sectoral forecast to 2001. 
The baseline was guided by a macroeconomic growth pattern for the components of
GDP to ensure a consistency between the meso and macro levels.</P>
<H4>Environmental Fiscal Reform</H4>
<P>This project is concerned with the equity aspects of substantial
environmental fiscal reform.  Five aspects are to be considered: first, the
income distribution of household expenditure on environmentally-sensitive goods
and services, such as electricity consumption, spending on petrol; second, the
effect of any extra employment and reductions in unemployment on the incomes of
the low-paid and of low-income households; third, the income distribution of
those who suffer damage from environmental costs; fourth, the effects of reform
on vulnerable demographic groups, such as the retired population; and fifth the
effects on rural versus urban households.  E3ME is to be used as a framework for
the statistics being collected and used by the project.</P>
<P>The project is being co-ordinated by the Department of Applied Economics,
University of Cambridge (Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DE, UK, tel +44 1223
335289, fax +44 1223 335299).  The set-up meeting of the project took place in
late January.</P>
