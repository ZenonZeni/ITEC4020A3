<H3>CHANGING DEFINITION OF RETIREMENT:
<BR>
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS EXPECT TO WORK DURING RETIREMENT,  ACCORDING TO
KEMPER-ROPER RETIREMENT MONITOR
</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (June 15) - A majority of working Americans believe they will be
forced to continue to work during retirement in order to make ends meet
and maintain their desired standard of living, according to a poll
released today by Kemper and Roper-Starch Worldwide.
<P>

The "Kemper-Roper Retirement Monitor" polled 2,086 randomly selected
Americans about their attitudes and expectations regarding retirement.
The survey included representation from demographic age groups
including: 20-Somethings (aged 20-29), Baby Boomers (aged 30-49),
Pre-retirees (aged 50-64) and Retirees (aged 65 and older). The survey
has a margin of error of plus/minus two percent.
<P>

"For Americans under the age of 50, the word "retirement" has taken on
new meaning," said William E. Chapman II, executive vice president of
Kemper. "When America's younger generations hit retirement age, it won't
necessarily mean the end of their working years - especially if they
want to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. Their challenge is to plan
carefully in an environment that is much more dynamic than their parents
had to contend with."
<P>

<B>Wages to replace Social Security, savings shortfalls</B>
<P>

"The old yardsticks by which current retirees measure their success in
funding a comfortable retirement no longer apply to younger Americans,"
noted Chapman. "These younger generations will try to fill the gap left
by what they expect to be limited Social Security benefits, diminished
health-care support and the lack of their own savings with wages earned
during retirement," Chapman predicted, and pointed to a number of
findings to support that claim:
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
A vast majority of the two younger generations surveyed - 71% of Baby
Boomers and 81% of 20-Somethings - believe that Social Security will not
be there for them. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Some 65% of Baby Boomers and 74% of 20-Somethings acknowledged that
they were not saving enough for retirement. Paying off a mortgage,
reducing credit card debt, and the costs of raising children are cited
as barriers to saving more.
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Despite their pessimistic expectations about government benefits they
might receive in retirement and their inadequate level of savings, 61%
of 20-Somethings and 68% of Baby Boomers believe that they will have
enough to live comfortably during retirement. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Nearly six out of 10 of working Americans surveyed believe that they
will need to work - at least part-time - during their retirement years.
Fortunately, perhaps, the same amount of respondents said they <B><I>want</I></B> &nbsp;to
continue working after retirement, regardless of their financial status.

<P>

<B>20-Somethings, Boomers and Pre-retirees seek more advice</B>
<P>

"Clearly, most Americans understand the importance of carefully planning
for retirement, so attitude is not the problem," Chapman said. "Rather,
changing political and economic conditions are causing uncertainty.
Despite the dearth of information available on retirement planning,
Americans are still clamoring for help." 
<P>

An overwhelming majority of 20-Somethings (69%), Baby Boomers (65%), and
Pre-Retirees (65%) said that their respective generations need more help
planning for retirement. Roughly one in three of 20-Somethings and Baby
Boomers and one in five Pre-Retirees feel "uncertain" or "at a total
loss" when it comes to planning for their own retirement.
<P>

When asked who they did or will turn to for advice on most of their
retirement planning, Americans cite a number of sources: a broker or
financial advisor (39%); spouse (37%); friends (24%); parents (23%);
other family members (15%); personal finance magazines (12%); research
publications (6%); and on-line financial services (3%).
<P>

Six out of 10 Americans felt they need a broker or financial advisor to
help them cut through the clutter and deal with all the information out
there about investments. Yet most weren't very confident in their
ability to chose a broker or financial advisor. More than half of the
20-Somethings and Baby Boomers feel either "uncertain" or "at a total
loss" when it comes to knowing how to select a broker or financial
advisor. 
<P>

<B>Among the survey's other key findings:</B>
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
When asked what one piece of advice they would give younger generations
about saving for retirement, retirees said "start saving early" (62%),
and "take advantage of company sponsored savings plans (18%). Few
mentioned "save more money" (8%). Not surprisingly, 47% of retirees said
they did not start saving early enough for retirement. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Only one in four retirees said they were able to accurately predict
their financial needs before they retired. 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Americans across all groups named company sponsored plans - including
401(k)
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
(52%) and 403(b) (4%) plans - as their top retirement savings vehicle,
followed by savings accounts (44%), mutual funds (40%), life insurance
(39%) and IRA or Keogh accounts (39%). 
<P>

<LI TYPE=CIRCLE>
Roughly two out of three Americans say that they share the
decision-making about investing for retirement with their spouse.
