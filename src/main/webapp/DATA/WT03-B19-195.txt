<h1>Education</h1>
<p>
Victoria has eight universities which provide an extensive range of 
under-graduate and post-graduate courses, including all those 
which are of direct relevance to business and the professions. Its 
well-educated workforce has the highest number of university 
degrees per person of any State in Australia. 

<p>
Kindergartens and schools at primary and secondary levels are run 
by the Government, by church organisations and privately. Many 
schools offer the International Baccalaureate, a means of entrance 
to most international universities. 

<p>
The school year of four terms begins in early February and ends in 
mid-December for the summer vacation.

<h1>Health care</h1>
<p>
Top-class public and private hospitals and clinics are located in 
Melbourne and major regional centres. 
Universal standard medical and hospital care is provided under 
Medicare, Australia's national health scheme. Private insurance is 
available to cover additional services and facilities.
Victoria is at the forefront in medical research and development 
with world-renowned research establishments based in Melbourne.
