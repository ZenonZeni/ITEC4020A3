<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Cognitive Apprenticeship Glossary</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#SG">Sue Gerber</A></FONT><BR>
<HR> 
There are several principles or aspects of learning and the learning process that are incorporated in cognitive apprenticeship models.  An overview of several of these aspects is given below, with specific attention to how they relate to cognitive apprenticeships.  Pertinent references and resources are also listed in the references section.<BR>
<DL>
<A NAME=Context></A>
<DT><LI> Context.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> This principle asserts that learning is not context free, but rather situational (click <A HREF="cogref#SC">here</A> for references on situated cognition).   Learning is not accomplished in a vacuum; all learning is done within a context and for a purpose.<BR> 
<BR>
For instructional purposes, certain contexts are more effective than others.  Teachers must consider this in planning their lessons, and strive to organize learning situations accordingly.   Tasks must be as "real world" and as relevant to the students as possible,  for instance.   Care must be taken, however,  to maintain the educational significance of the tasks.  (This can be accomplished by incorporating the articulating, reflecting, exploring factors of learning.)<BR>  
<BR>
Additionally,  one cannot reduce learning to isolated situations, so the teacher must also work to make connections between concepts and to facilitate an understanding of underlying principles (see the generalization entry in this glossary).<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=Coop></A>
<DT><LI> Cooperation and dialogue.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> In the "real world," very little learning is done in total isolation.  Rather, learning is often a goal directed and cooperative effort of individuals seeking to achieve some tangible objective.  <A HREF="../Coop/Coop.home">Cooperative learning</A> has been studied extensively in teaching situations, and there are several reasons proposed for its superiority.  Some of those relevant to cognitive apprenticeships include the supposition that  by working with others, students are exposed to different, often contradictory, thought processes and conceptions. Through negotiation, discussion, dialogue,  and reflection (see entry in this glossary)  individuals must examine the reasons behind their concepts, articulate them, and in that process gain a deeper understanding  of the constructs involved.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=Expert></A>
<DT><LI> Expert vs. novice.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> The distinction between experts and novices is obviously fundamental to the cognitive apprenticeship view of teaching and learning.  There has been a good deal of research related to these differences.  Initially, research studies focused on simply delineating the differences in performance, memory, and use of cognitive strategies between members of these two groups.  More recently, the focus has been on examining the process by which individuals move from novice to expert.   These latter studies will be of particular interest to teachers and others interested in instructional design.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=Generalization></A>
<DT><LI>  Generalization.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> This is one area in which traditional apprenticeships and cognitive apprenticeships differ.  In the former, learning is accomplished when the skill (usually physical) is attained.  The learning is tied to the task, in other words.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> Although it is recognized that learning is situational, some degree of transfer is also required for learning to be successful in the cognitive apprenticeship.  For example,  if a student learns the concept of adding fractions only in conjunction with slices of pizza, there is a danger that he or she will not be able to apply the abstracted principles to another situation.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><LI> Global understanding first,  then local aspects.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> Under the cognitive apprenticeship model, the teacher focuses first on the global aspect of the task and then on the separate aspects.  In other words, students are aware of the goal, or "finishing state."  This knowledge of the big picture facilitates a more complete understanding of the purpose underlying the separate tasks.  The global portion of this process is accomplished through the modeling or observation stage of cognitive apprenticeships.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=Reflection></A>
<DT><LI> Reflection.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> Reflection is a hallmark of expertise (see expert vs. novice entry).  Cognitive apprenticeships are designed to give the student a basis and an opportunity to develop such reflective strategies.  The modeling phase, during which the student observes the teacher, provides him or her with a conceptual model of the process on which to draw, and with which to compare and evaluate his or her own cognitive development.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=Scaffolding></A>
<DT><LI> Scaffolding.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> The teacher provides the student with support.  Vygotsky used this term in conjunction with the "Zone of Proximal Development" (ZPD).  The ZPD refers to a child's current level of ability of functioning.  An individual cannot perform tasks that fall within his or her ZPD without assistance, but can do so with the help of a more capable peer or a teacher.  Through support, guidance,  and practice, an individual masters more tasks, and moves farther ahead on the continuum toward total mastery.  Thus, the ZPD moves as well; as certain tasks "fall out" of it, other, more advanced tasks,  enter.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=Simple></A>
<DT><LI> Simple first, then complex.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> 
In traditional apprenticeships such a tailoring, the novice tailor may begin by sewing buttons, but never by creating an entire shirt.  The reason is obvious; the task of sewing a shirt is complex, consisting of many individual tasks each of which must be mastered  before the procedure can be successful.  The only way to do this is to concentrate on perfecting the simple tasks, and then gradually adding on to them, making them more complex, until they represent the process of creating an entire shirt.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> The same is true in the case of cognitive apprenticeships. A student cannot perform integration in  calculus, for example, without knowledge of basic algebraic principles.  This notion is very similar to scaffolding  (see entry in this glossary) and controlling the cognitive load.  At the beginning of learning a process,  the teacher assumes much of the cognitive load.  That  is, he or she organizes the learning environment so as not to overwhelm the student with tasks that are simply too advanced based on the child's prior knowledge and level of cognitive functioning in a given area.   At first, the student is required to perform relatively simple tasks alone.  Gradually, the simple tasks will should then be integrated with one another.  Eventually, the complex process which represents the educational objective can be accomplished.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME=Strategies></A>
<DT><LI> Strategies.<BR>
<BR>
<DD> In many ways, much of the processes that the teacher models are control or regulatory, and are referred to as <A HREF="../Metacog/Meta.home">metacognitive strategies</A>.  This is especially evident in <A HREF="cogexam#RT">reciprocal teaching</A>, a method for increasing  reading comprehension developed in the cognitive apprenticeship framework.
