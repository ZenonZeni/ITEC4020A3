<blockquote><font size=+1>
January, 1997<p>

Dear Friends:<p>

The next time you're in Ho Chi Minh City and have a few late-afternoon hours to spare, wander down to the waterside park just in front of the Majestic Hotel. When the varied hawkers approach you, listen for the voices offering the boat trips up and down the silty Saigon River. Choose a boat that looks relatively sturdy then head downstream.<p>

As you weave through the moored tankers and container ships loading and unloading at the docks along the riverbank, you will get an up-close look at a key to Vietnam's future economic success. If Vietnam is to match the growth of its neighbors, it will have to promote export-oriented industries and liberalize its trade policies.<p>

In December the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) emphasized the importance of trade reform in a report titled "Catching Up." The authors urged Hanoi to level the playing field between state and private traders, and to end the use of restrictive quotas and export-import licenses. The <a href="../february97/coverstory.html">cover story</a> in this edition of the VBJ Online looks at how two companies -- one an importer, the other an exporter -- navigate through some of these challenges.<p>

Since our print edition went to press, Hanoi took a dramatic step in line with the UNDP recommendations. The Ministry of Trade announced that for the first time, Vietnam's lucrative rice-export business would be officially opened to private traders. If implemented, the move will help make Vietnam's rice trade more efficient, improve its reputation among international buyers, and most importantly, allow farmers the chance to sell at better prices. It is a turn down the right road -- one which we believe Vietnam will continue to follow.<p>

As always, we look forward to hearing your ideas, thoughts and comments. Please feel free to send me a message at <a href="mailto:cmoore@viam.com">cmoore@viam.com</a>.<p>


Sincerely,<p>
Christopher Moore<br>
