<p>The VORTEX vehicle's on-board electronics system only performs
basic control of engines and sensors; all the vehicle control
software is located on a surface computer. The control software
is a real-time, object-oriented system based on a C++ approach;
object classes are applied to the vehicle's different types of
subsystems: sensors, actuators, control laws, filters. The
operating system is VxWorks. Two kinds of control laws are
applied: basic and complex control tasks: Basic control tasks:
control of the vehicle's main state variables, governing the
vehicle's internal state and enabling it to reach and maintain a
given state. Complex control tasks: higher-level vehicle control
laws for performance of different missions; these use data
provided by sensors to perform specific tasks (wall following,
target detection and tracking). A mission is defined by a set of
scheduled actions, each one modeled as a control task with functional
and behavioral aspects; mission behaviour is event-driven, i.e.
its definition (start, end, task activation, recovery...) entails
defining a set of signals for handling. The synchronous
programming of reactive systems is performed through the use of
the Esterel Language. The proposed top-down architecture is
composed of different modules: Interpretation module: reads the
plan written by the operator via the user interface and, by
translating instructions, acts as an interface between the
operator and other modules. Knowledge data base: contains all
data related to the robot and the environment, as well as models
of actions and the representation of actions in progress; it also
contains some particular conditions which must be checked before
an action can be performed. Inference module: supervises the
execution of actions by checking their associated rules.
Execution module: constitutes the interface between the control
system and machine actuators and sensors; it manages
communications between the different modules and translates
messages and commands into orders, which are interpreted and
executed by the machine. </p>
