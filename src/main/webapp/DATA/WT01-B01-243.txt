There is often a  bunk open for visiting scientists on SEA Semester
cruises. This is available to interested scientists who wish to
conduct research that fits with the academic and research programs
of that cruise or who wish to learn more about SEA's programs.
All research capabilities of <I>Westward </I>or <I>Corwith Cramer</I>
can be made available, under direction of the chief scientist
of that cruise. The visiting scientist is expected to involve
the students aboard the vessel in their work as appropriate and
to function as an active member of the cruise. There is no charge
for ship time, but the visiting scientist must provide their own
transportation to and from the vessel.
