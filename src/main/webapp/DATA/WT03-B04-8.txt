ITRI OPENS BERLIN OFFICE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Bonn, Sept. 13 (CNA) The Industrial Technology Research Institute
(ITRI),  Taiwan's  largest independent research institute, has set up
an  office  in  Berlin  in  a bid to expand exchanges and cooperation
between Taiwanese and German enterprises and academic bodies.

    ITRI  Vice  President  Chen  Ling-yuan made the announcement here
Thursday at a conference sponsored by ROC economic missions and trade
groups based in central Germany.

    In   line  with  the  government's  internationalization  policy,
domestic  research  institutes  also  need  to  establish strongholds
abroad  to boost international technology interflow with Taiwan, Chen
said,  pointing  out the ITRI has so far opened offices in the United
States, Japan and Russia.

    The initial target of the Berlin office, Chen said, is to upgrade
Taiwan-Germany  cooperation  in  machinery, and then expand bilateral
exchanges to optical-electric and energy sectors.

    The  ITRI  office  in  Silicon Valley in California is focused on
recruiting high-end electronics know-how, while its Russian office is
aimed at aerospace technology, he added.

TAIWAN-JAPAN JOINT VENTURE FORGED FOR MANUFACTURE OF CIRCUIT FOIL


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA) The state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp. Friday
sealed  a  joint-venture agreement with three Japanese enterprises to
build a circuit foil plant in Taiwan.

    The  plant, estimated to cost NT$2.25 billion (US$81.81 million),
is  scheduled  to  come on line before the end of 1997, with a yearly
output of 5,100 metric tons of circuit foil.

    The  production  facility will be located in the Toliu Industrial
Park, central Taiwan, occupying an area of 3.1 hectares. Construction
of  the  plant  is slated to begin in July. The investment project is
pending the final approval of the Economics Ministry.

    Taisugar  will  hold  a  45  percent  stake  in the joint-venture
project  while  Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. will control a 25 percent
interest  and  Nichimen  Corp.  and  Circuit  Foil  Japan will own 20
percent and 10 percent, respectively.

    "The  design  of  the  plant and manufacturing technology will be
provided  by  Circuit  Foil Japan," Taisugar President Chien Pin-tsai
said,  adding  that  except  for  some  machines,  the  bulk  of  the
manufacturing equipment the plant needs is available in Taiwan.

    According  to Chien, Taiwan consumes about 25,000 tons of circuit
foil a year, 12,000 tons of which relies on import. Circuit foil is a
key  material  used in circuit boards and a wide range of electronics
products.

    Masaya  Imayi,  standing  board director of Furukawa Electric and
who  was  present  to ink the agreement, said the investment decision
was  prompted  by the booming development of the electronics industry
in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Asian region.

    "Taiwan is expected to play a pivotal role in Furukawa Electric's
global operation strategy," Imayi said.

    Furukawa  has been manufacturing and marketing circuit foil since
1961 and has emerged as the largest supplier of foil used in printing
circuit boards in Japan.

    Furukawa has NT$160 billion (US$5.81 billion) in annual revenues,
while  Nichimen,  one of the top eight trading firms in Japan, boasts
NT$2 trillion. Of the 10,000 tons of circuit foil Taiwan imports from
Japan each year, 50-70 percent is transacted through Nichimen.

TAICHUNG EPZ EXPORTS UP IN FIRST 8 MONTHS


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  The  Taichung  Export  Processing Zone
exported  US$536  million worth of products in the first eight months
of  this  year,  up from US$526 million in the same period last year,
according  to  statistics released Saturday by the EPZ Administration
under the Economics Ministry.

    The  zone  imported  US$287  million  worth  of materials between
January  and August, down from US$293 million in the same period last
year, the statistics showed.

    The  precision  machinery  industry  led  others  with exports of
US$265  million,  accounting  for  49.41  percent of the zone's total
outbound shipments.

    Electrical/electronics machinery manufacturing ranked second with
exports of US$216 million, or 40.42 percent of the total.

    Most  of  the zone's exports went to Japan, which absorbed US$253
million,  or  47.21 percent, of the zone's total exports, followed by
Hong  Kong  with  US$104  million,  or  19.56 percent, the statistics
showed.

    Japan also was the leading source of imports. Taichung EPZ bought
in  US$228  million  worth  of  goods  from  Japan in the eight-month
period, accounting for 79.42 percent of total imports in the zone.

    A  total  of 45 enterprises were operating in the Taichung Export
Processing  Zone  at  the  end  of August, with cumulative investment
topping US$221 million, EPZ Administration officials said.

    Booming  exports  and  imports in the zone indicate manufacturers
have   full   confidence  in  the  zone,  which  is  developing  high
technology, high quality, high value-added products.

LOUISIANA HOPES TO RESUME CROCODILE MEAT EXPORTS TO TAIWAN


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Houston,  Sept.  13  (CNA)  The  Louisiana state government hopes
Louisiana  can  resume  exports  of  crocodile  meat  to  Taiwan, Roy
Johnson, director of market development under the state's Agriculture
and Forestry Department, said Friday.

    Johnson said Taiwan once imported 10 containers of crocodile meat
from  the  United States in 1992, but the meat was banned from import
in 1993 because of wildlife protection issues.

    He  said  crocodile meat produced in the US comes from farms that
also raise chickens and cows, so the crocodile meat, like chicken and
beef, has nothing to do with wildlife protection.

    Hong Kong, Britain, Belgium, and Germany also import US crocodile
meat,  while  South  Korea,  Hong  Kong, Singapore, Italy, and France
import crocodile leather.

    American  businessmen  once  tried  to  export  crocodile meat to
Shanghai, but the deal fell through because of price differences.

    Resumption  of  crocodile meat exports to Taiwan was raised while
Lin  Yung-loh,  director-general  of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Boston, was visiting Louisiana.

'NEW TAIWAN EXPERIENCE ERA' HAS BEGUN, SAYS LEE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept. 14 (CNA) President Lee Teng-hui said Saturday that
a  "new  Taiwan  experience  era"  began  when  the Republic of China
completed  the  first popular presidential election in 5,000 years of
Chinese history in March.

    The pivotal task for Taiwan now is to ensure a solid existence of
the  Republic of China in the face of a volatile future, Lee said. To
reach  that  goal,  he noted, "We must stabilize society, broaden our
international   horizons,  and  accelerate  exchanges  with  mainland
China."

    Addressing  the  Third  National  Management  Forum  which opened
Thursday  at the Grand Hyatt Taipei, Lee called on the Taiwan public,
particularly  the  business  sector  to  "avoid  jumping  the gun and
exercise  patience"  in the face of a renewed economic offensive from
mainland China.

    Lee  said Beijing has recently stepped up its economic offensive,
a  strategy designed to gain political aims through commercial means.
While luring Taiwan civilians and businessmen to press the government
to adopt policies in its favor, Beijing is also trying to agitate the
society of Taiwan, he pointed out.

    Lee  told the forum, which pulled together more than 400 business
and industrial leaders of the country, that the government will spare
no effort to improve Taiwan's investment climate.

    He said he will ask related government agencies to see to it that
all   investment   barriers,   including   the   difficulty  in  land
acquisition,  are  addressed within six months to expedite investment
here at home. A special desk will be established soon exclusively for
handling land-related problems, and the processing for each case will
be handled in no longer than two months, Lee promised.

    Outdated  and  inefficient regulations must go to create a better
investment  environment,  he  added.  Taking Japan as an example, Lee
said  that  despite  government's  efforts to cut interest rates, the
Japanese  economy  has not been able to break out of its recession in
seven  or  eight years because superannuated regulations and statutes
there have blocked the way and choked off investment willingness.

    During  the  three-day  forum,  Taiwan's  business and industrial
leaders  expressed  confidence  in the country's future and agreed to
pitch  in  more  than NT$100 billion (US$3.6 billion) in the next two
years for investment projects on the island.

TAIWAN 'KAMIKAZE SQUAD' VOWS TO BLOW UP DISPUTED LIGHTHOUSE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Six men with criminal records Saturday
formed  a  death  squad  and  pledged  to destroy the lighthouse they
claimed  was  erected illegally by a Japanese right-wing group on one
of the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.

    The  six  men,  all of which received diving and bombing training
when  they  served  in  the  army,  met  the  press and displayed the
testament they signed.

    The  group  guaranteed  they  would  blow  up  the  solar-powered
lighthouse  set  up  on one of the Tiaoyutais in the middle of May by
the Japan Youth Federation.

    The uninhabitated islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan, lie in
the  East  China Sea about 200 kilometers northeast of Taiwan and 300
kilometers west of Japan's Okinawa Island. Taiwan, mainland China and
Japan all lay sovereignty claims over the islands.

    "Should  any  one  of  them  die of natural disaster or any other
reason  on  their  voyage  to  the  Tiaoyutais,  their families would
receive  NT$600,000  each,"  said  Tung Nien-tai, head of a center to
provide  services  to  former  inmates.  Tung said he would raise the
money from the public, if needed.

    The  blitz  plans  are  underway,  Tung  said,  adding  that  the
operation would be launched soon.

    Tung said that under his draft plans, the group would swim ashore
after  being  brought  by a boat to waters about a nautical mile from
the lighthouse.

    No government officials were immediately available for comment.

    Saturday's  announcement  came  as the international dispute over
the  Tiaoyutais  was  escalating.  After  the  lighthouse was set up,
another  Japanese  ultra-right  group,  the  Senkaku  Islands Defense
Association, in mid-August planted a wooden Japanese flag and erected
a war memorial on the largest of the islands.

    The  provocative moves  have  triggered  a  strong  response from
Chinese  communities  in the United States, mainland China, Hong Kong
and  Taiwan.  While  some  groups  protested  to  Japanese government
officials stationed in their area, others have called for an alliance
of  the Chinese throughout the world to stand tough against what they
called a "Japanese invasion" of Chinese territory.

    In  Taipei,  the  government  of the Republic of China, saying it
wants  to  settle  the  dispute with Japan peacefully, has repeatedly
urged  the  Japanese  government  to  restrain its people from taking
further provocative actions.

NO CONSENSUS IN US-TAIWAN MEDICAL EQUIPMENT CONSULTATIONS


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  While Taiwan has just been told by the
United  States  that  it  will  be  removed  from  the  "Special 301"
blacklist  for  having achieved satisfactory progress in intellectual
property  rights  (IPR)  protection,  it may face a fresh threat from
Washington over its new medical equipment pricing policy.

    No  consensus was reached Saturday in a US-Taiwan consultation on
Taiwan's pricing policy for medical equipment, and whether Washington
will  list  Taiwan  under  its  "Super  301" bill for trade sanctions
remains to be seen.

    David  Burns,  chief officer in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs at
the  office  of  the  US Trade Representative (USTR), on Saturday met
with  officials  from the Department of Health (DOH) and the National
Health  Insurance  Bureau (NHIB) on NHIB's pricing policy for medical
equipment and related products.

    The  two  parties  failed  to reach any consensus, and decided to
meet again on Monday for another round of talks.

    The  USTR  office  was  reported earlier this week to have listed
Taiwan  as a "priority country" under its annual "Super 301" bill for
trade   sanctions   after   the   US  Health  Industry  Manufacturers
Association filed an accusation saying Taiwan's new medical equipment
pricing policy is "non-transparent and discriminates against American
suppliers."

    Burns   said  Taiwan's  implementation  of  the  national  health
insurance  program  is  highly  commendable.  But it takes effort and
expertise  to  ensure  the  public's  access  to quality medicine and
medical  equipment.  He  said  American  medical equipment comes with
quality,  and  Taiwanese  patients  have  the  right  to  use quality
products.

    USTR  officials will continue to exchange views with DOH and NHIB
officials  in  the  next two weeks on the pricing policy, Burns said,
adding  that  his office will not make any decision until Sept. 30 on
whether to recommend a "Super 301" listing for retaliation.

    Yeh Chin-chuan, general manager of the NHIB, said the new medical
equipment  pricing  policy  is consistent with the national treatment
principle  set by the World Trade Organization, as it applies to both
local and foreign suppliers.

    Foreign  suppliers  can  file  their complaints to Taiwan if they
want  to  challenge  the  policy, and the NHIB will review the policy
periodically, Yeh added.

    Yeh  hoped  that all misunderstandings will be solved in the next
round of talks on Monday. If not, he said, NHIB officials will travel
to the United States later this month for further talks.

CHANG ASKS JAPAN TO EXERCISE RESTRAINT IN TERRITORIAL DISPUTE


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Foreign Affairs Minister John Chang on
Saturday  reiterated  his  call  for  Japan  to exercise restraint in
handling  the  territorial dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands, or the
Senkakus to the Japanese.

    Chang,  however,  would  not  comment  on the report that Beijing
authorities,   faced  with  mounting  pressure  from  its  people  to
safeguard  the  Tiaoyutai Islands, have asked activists to cool their
activity.

    Chang made the remarks after attending a reception in celebration
of  the  175th  Independence  Anniversary  of  the  five countries in
Central America.

    Vice  Foreign  Affairs  Minister  Cheng  Chien-jen  said  the ROC
government's position on the issue is crystal clear. "The ROC insists
on  sovereignty  over  the islands, but is hoping to settle the issue
through  peaceful means and is not planning to cooperate with Beijing
on the matter."

    Observers  from  here  and  abroad have urged Taipei and Beijing,
which  are  still  technically at war since 1949, to work together in
negotiating with Japan.

    The  Tiaoyutais  lie  in  the East China Sea about 200 kilometers
northeast  of  Taiwan  and  300  kilometers  west  of Japan's Okinawa
Island.  Taipei,  Beijing  and  Tokyo  all claim sovereignty over the
uninhabitated islands.

    Chang  also  declined  to  comment on  the  report  that  a local
rightest  organization  is  planning to send a death squad to blow up
the  lighthouse erected by a Japanese group on one of the islands. "I
have no knowledge of the report," Chang said.

    Cheng  said  he  could understand the patriotism some people have
toward  the  country,  but  he  stressed  that calmness is definitely
needed to settle the issue.

    He  also  urged the public to have faith in the government. "From
the  government's  point of view, the priority we always have in mind
is what is in the best interests of the country and people."

    Cheng said Tokyo is expected to propose a date for a second round
of  talks  on a fisheries agreement. The two sides held a closed-door
meeting in Taipei on Aug. 3., but did not arrive at an agreement.

5 CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES CELEBRATE INDEPENDENCE DAY


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  Five Central American countries held a
cocktail party and opened a painting exhibition in Taipei Saturday to
celebrate the 175th anniversary of their nations' independence.

    Many  ROC  government  officials  and foreign envoys attended the
celebration activities sponsored by El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
Costa Rica, and Guatemala.

    ROC  Foreign  Minister  John  Chang said at the party that Taiwan
shares  close  and  friendly relations with the five Central American
countries,  and ROC President Lee Teng-hui will visit Central America
next year.

    Despite  difficulties each of the Central American countries have
faced,  their  pursuit  of  democracy  and constitutional politics is
admired around the world, Chang said.

    Chang  said  the ROC and its diplomatic allies in Central America
have  the  same  political  ideals  and goal of peace, adding that he
hopes  freedom,  democracy, and equitable distribution of wealth will
arrive as early as possible.

    The  painting  exhibition,  which  featured  100  works by modern
painters  from  Central  America,  as  well as 29 masterpieces from a
Costa  Rican  museum,  will  help  boost  cultural interflows between
Taiwan  and the five countries. The art show is being held at the Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall Sept. 14-25.

    Also  present  at  the  party  were  Control  Yuan President Wang
Tso-jung, Deputy Secretary-General to the President Chen Hsi-fan, and
art figures from home and abroad.

DPP GROUP TO DRUM UP WORLD SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S UN BID


from CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (Taiwan), September 14, 1996

    Taipei,  Sept.  14  (CNA)  A  senior official from the opposition
Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP)  will lead a DPP mission abroad
Sunday  to drum up international support for Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations, sources from DPP headquarters said Saturday.

    Trong  Tsai, a member of the DPP Central Standing Committee, said
the  15-member  DPP mission will visit the United States, Germany and
nations  unnamed  to promote Taiwan's campaign to gain a place in the
international community, particularly the United Nations.

    The  sources  said  Tsai  and his DPP comrades will stage a press
conference  in  New  York  on  Sept. 17, when the UN General Assembly
