<title>Lighting Retrofits Cut Error Rates and Improve Productivity</title>
<table><tr><td><blockquote><H3>2. Lighting Retrofits Cut Error Rates and Improve Productivity</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Lighting accounts for 19 percent of all electricity sold in the United 
States.<a href="#173" name="r173"> [ 173 ] </a>Every kilowatt-hour of lighting not used prevents emissions of 
5.8 grams of sulfur dioxide, 2.5 grams of nitrogen oxides, and 1.5 pounds 
of carbon dioxide.<a href="#174" name="r174"> [ 174 ] </a>The best light bulbs on the market use only a 
quarter as much energy as conventional incandescent light bulbs and last 
ten times longer, preventing the burning of up to 400 pounds of coal, and 
saving consumers a net $35 on their electricity bills over the life of the 
improved bulb. <BR>
<p>     If energy-efficient lighting were installed everywhere profitable, 
America's demand for electricity would drop by more than 10 percent. This 
would result in annual emission reductions of 1.3 million metric tons of 
sulfur dioxide, 600,000 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 202 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide. Those reductions would be equivalent to 
taking 44.5 million cars off the road,<a href="#175" name="r175"> [ 175 ] </a>and represent 12 percent of all 
U.S. utility emissions.<a href="#176" name="r176"> [ 176 ] </a><P>
<B><I> <p>     EPA's Green Lights Program.</B></I> Although lighting 
represents only about 10 percent of the available electricity savings 
potential in the U.S. economy, lighting represents one of the easiest ways 
to save electricity.<a href="#177" name="r177"> [ 177 ] </a>The Environmental Protection Agency's "Green 
Lights" Program has brought together more than 1,600 organizations<a href="#178" name="r178"> [ 178 ] </a>to 
upgrade their lighting with state-of-the-art technologies. In 1994, Green 
Lights participants saved more than 1 million megawatt-hours of 
electricity, which reduced electricity bills by more than $92 million<a href="#179" name="r179"> [ 179 ] </a>
and cut carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 633,200 metric tons.<a href="#180" name="r180"> [ 180 ] </a>
The typical Green Lights upgrade yields an after-tax internal rate of 
return of 20 to 40 percent. Unanticipated benefits often include increased 
employee productivity and morale improvements from better lighting 
quality. Full implementation of Green Lights upgrades by current 
participants could save $15.8 billion and 12.2 million megawatt-hours of 
electricity annually, while cutting carbon dioxide emissions by more than 
7.7 million metric tons per year.<a href="#181" name="r181"> [ 181 ] </a>If that $15.8 billion were reinvested 
in jobs and enhanced productivity, by the year 2000, Green Lights could 
result in more than 220,000 new jobs.<a href="#182" name="r182"> [ 182 ] </a>
<BR>
<p>     <B><I><A NAME="LawrenceBerkeleyNationalLaboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory<a>.</B></I> Since the 
mid-1970s, the DOE has invested some $70 million at Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory (LBNL) for research and development of advanced 
energy-efficient building technologies, software, and standards. That 
investment has helped spawn a $2.4 billion U.S. market for key 
products - including energy-efficient lighting. <BR>
<p>    <p>      Lighting costs U.S. businesses and consumers nearly $40 billion 
each year. The strategic use of federal research dollars can trim billions 
from this annual bill. LBNL's early work on the electronic ballast 
illustrates the potential payoff from lighting research and working with 
industry. <BR>
<p>    <p>      The electronic ballast has developed from a laboratory curiosity 
to a highly successful energy-efficient lighting technology. By 1993, 
electronic ballasts had captured 23 percent of total ballast sales. They 
will likely replace magnetic ballasts in more than 75 percent of 
applications by 2015 because of utility and other incentive programs and 
federal programs and standards. The federal investment in electronic 
ballast research and development is about $3 million. Cumulative energy 
savings attributable to electronic ballasts from 1988 to 1993 alone were 
$400 million. Businesses and consumers will ultimately save a net $700 
million from electronic ballasts installed through 1993, which could grow 
to $13 billion for technologies installed through the year 2015. By 2015, 
electronic ballast technology could avoid 142,400 metric tons of sulfur 
dioxide, 130,600 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 66.2 million metric 
tons of carbon dioxide.<a href="#183" name="r183"> [ 183 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="Boeing">Boeing</A>.</B></I> Substantial inroads have been made in 
cutting lighting electricity demand. For example, Boeing, headquartered in 
Renton, Washington, has been an EPA Green Lights participant. Lighting 
upgrades have cut electricity use by 25 to 90 percent in several million 
square feet of its facilities, with a 53 percent annual return on 
investment. Boeing's upgrades have saved 130,000 megawatt-hours, have paid 
for themselves in just two years, and have cut carbon dioxide emissions by 
18,070 metric tons per year. Other air pollutants have also been reduced, 
including 4,536 metric tons of sulfur dioxide and 1,815 metric tons of 
nitrogen oxides each year. The new lighting has improved workers' 
abilities to detect defects by 20 percent. The savings from catching 
errors early, according to Lawrence Friedman, Boeing's conservation 
manager, while difficult to measure, are estimated to exceed greatly the 
cost of the energy-efficient upgrades.<a href="#184" name="r184"> [ 184 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="PennsylvaniaPower&Light">Pennsylvania Power & Light<a>. </B></I>Pennsylvania Power & 
Light's drafting engineers had been working in a 12,775-square-foot room 
prone to "veiling reflections," a form of indirect glare. A lighting 
upgrade - consisting of high-efficiency lamps and ballasts fitted with 
parabolic louvers to reduce glare - in a 2,275-square-foot portion of 
the shop floor brought impressive results. Building superintendent Russell 
Allen notes, "Generally speaking &#138; we converted from general lighting 
to task lighting. As a result, more of the light is directed specifically 
to work areas and less is applied to circulation areas, creating more 
variance in lighting levels which upgrades the appearance of the space." 
The total net cost of the lighting upgrade was $8,362. Energy use dropped 
69 percent, and annual operating costs fell 73 percent from $2,800 to 
$765. With these savings, the investment would have paid for itself in 4.1 
years, a 24-percent return. But the resulting 13.2 percent boost in 
productivity, worth $42,240 a year, turned a 24 percent return on 
investment into a 540 percent return with payback in just 69 days. 
Absenteeism and error rates dropped and morale rose, changes worth at 
least another $50,000 per year. All told, the return on investment 
exceeded 1,000 percent.<a href="#185" name="r185"> [ 185 ] </a>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="AT&T">AT&T</a>. </B></I>AT&T in Columbus, Ohio slashed its energy 
costs by $4.5 million over 14 years by installing state-of-the-art metal 
halide light bulbs, improving insulation, and installing variable-speed 
drives on heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning fans.<a href="#186" name="r186"> [ 186 ] </a>The light 
bulb retrofits alone saved roughly 1,000 megawatt-hours of electricity per 
year - which slashed electricity bills 50 percent - while increasing 
light levels 70 percent. Workers in assembly areas, where small parts are 
handled, reported that they can see better now that old-style fluorescent 
lighting has been replaced with metal halide bulbs. Assembly errors have 
dropped, resulting in a marked improvement in productivity. The lighting 
retrofits alone cut carbon dioxide emissions by 820 metric tons annually. 
<a href="#187" name="r187"> [ 187 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="HydeTools">Hyde Tools<a>. </B></I>Hyde Tools, a Massachusetts-based 
manufacturer of cutting blades, installed a lighting upgrade of 
sodium-vapor and metal-halide bulbs in the early 1990s. The retrofit cost 
$98,000 (including labor), with $48,000 of that covered by the local 
utility. Annual energy savings came to $48,000, yielding a payback of 
about one year. Substantial productivity improvements resulted 
unexpectedly. Doug DeVries, the company's purchasing manager, initially 
installed the upgrade in only a small portion of the factory floor. At 
first, several workers complained because the new lights cast an orange 
hue. After six months, he gave workers the option of restoring the 
original lighting on the principle that no amount of energy saved would be 
worth making his operators dissatisfied. But according to DeVries, "When 
we experimented by turning the old fluorescent lights back on after six 
months, there was a near riot of disapproval." The new lights had made it 
possible to see tiny specks of dirt on each blade during their 
manufacture. Unless detected, the dirt caused product defects. With the 
new lighting, DeVries says, "The quality of work improved significantly 
because we could see things we couldn't see before." DeVries estimates 
that the improved quality was worth another $25,000 a year to the company. 
DeVries notes that every dollar saved on the shop floor is worth $10 in 
direct sales - and thus the improved quality from the efficient 
lighting was the equivalent of a $250,000 increase in sales.<a href="#188" name="r188"> [ 188 ] </a>
<B><I><BR>
 <p>     <A NAME="UnitedAirlines">United Airlines<a>. </B></I>The United Airlines Maintenance 
Operations Center at San Francisco International Airport could save an 
estimated $100,000 annually due to a lighting retrofit recently completed 
by <A NAME="ParkeIndustries,Inc.">Parke Industries, Inc.<a> United wanted to improve productivity in an 
important maintenance and repair area by enhancing the quality of light. 
Workers in this area regularly service aircraft, parts and components for 
the airline's entire fleet flying both domestic and international routes. 
The lighting project is expected to cut 1,022 megawatt-hours of 
electricity annually, saving $51,000 off annual electric bills - about 
half the original $100,000 annual operating cost. The project payback is 
1.09 years. Additional benefits include another $48,000 in savings from 
reduced maintenance requirements. Carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 
350 metric tons each year.<a href="#189" name="r189"> [ 189 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     The <A NAME="WorldTradeCenter">World Trade Center<a>. </B></I>New York's World Trade

$834,000 cash incentive and is offering a shared savings deal on the 
$991,000 balance. Yearly demand and consumption of electricity will be 
reduced by approximately 828 kilowatts and 5,121 megawatt-hours, resulting 
in an annual savings of nearly $330,000 while reducing annual carbon 
dioxide emissions by 2,406 metric tons.<a href="#190" name="r190"> [ 190 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="LockheedMartinDefenseSystems">Lockheed Martin Defense Systems <a> </B></I>Lockheed Martin 
Defense Systems in Pittsfield, Massachusetts upgraded more than 8,000 
assorted fluorescent fixtures to high-efficiency electronic ballasts and 
energy-efficient T-8 lamps, saving 3,400 megawatt-hours of electricity per 
year and reducing annual energy bills by $188,100 (a 113 percent internal 
rate of return). Carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 2,250 metric 
tons per year, which is equivalent to taking 496 cars off the road each 
year.<a href="#191" name="r191"> [ 191 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     Ashton Elementary School.</B></I> Ashton Elementary 
School in Sarasota, Florida retrofitted its lighting from 4,444 T-12s and 
20 incandescent lamps to 2,222 T-8s and 20 compact twin-tube lamps, which 
improved the quality of classroom light while reducing electricity 
consumption by 246 megawatt-hours per year at a savings of $17,236 - an 
annual internal rate of return of 50 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions 
were cut by 144 metric tons annually, equivalent to taking 32 cars off the 
road per year.<a href="#192" name="r192"> [ 192 ] </a>
<P>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="ShellOil">Shell Oil<a>. </B></I>Shell Oil implemented a lighting 
upgrade at its Anacortes, Washington refinery, replacing 7,730 150-watt 
incandescent lamps with 7,520 70-watt high pressure sodiums and 240 T-8 
lamps. The retrofit cut electricity demand by 1,803 megawatt-hours per 
year, saving $127,346 in energy costs - a 25.5 percent internal rate of 
return. Greater efficiency from the lighting upgrade reduced annual carbon 
dioxide emissions by 250 metric tons, equivalent to taking 55 cars off the 
road each year.<a href="#193" name="r193"> [ 193 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="UniversityofCaliforniaatBerkeley">University of California at Berkeley<a>. </B></I>University 
of California at Berkeley's five-year, $6 million lighting upgrade project 
renovated the lighting in 60 campus buildings by installing 91,000 
high-efficiency ballasts, 18,000 reflectors, and 3,000 occupancy sensors. 
Electricity saved amounted to 12,116 megawatt-hours each year, at an 
energy cost savings of $909,000 annually - a 20 percent internal rate 
of return. Annual carbon dioxide emissions were reduced by 4,156 metric 
tons, equivalent to taking 915 cars off the road each year.<a href="#194" name="r194"> [ 194 ] </a>

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="TennesseeValleyAuthority">Tennessee Valley Authority<a>. </B></I>The Tennessee Valley 
Authority set an example for other public agencies by replacing 524 
incandescent fixtures with compact fluorescents and 190 incandescent exit 
signs with LED exit signs at its Knoxville Office Complex. TVA also 
replaced 9,400 old fluorescent fixtures with T-8 lamps, electronic 
ballasts, and parabolic lenses and installed 1,200 occupancy sensors to 
control lighting. The upgrade cut TVA's electricity demand by 3,100 
megawatt-hours, saving $210,000 each year while reducing annual carbon 
dioxide emissions by 1,879 metric tons - equivalent to removing 414 
cars from the road each year.<a href="#195" name="r195"> [ 195 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="Nike,Inc.">Nike, Inc.<a> </B></I>Nike upgraded 1,545 T-12 lamps to 
1,545 8-foot T-8 lamps, all with electronic ballasts, at its Western 
Division Distribution Center in Wilsonville, Oregon. It also upgraded 44 
exit signs from 20-watt incandescent lamps to 2-watt LEDs. After the 
upgrade, Nike found it was spending half the amount on energy while 
getting twice the lighting level. Electricity demand dropped by 331 
megawatt-hours per year, saving $16,553. Annual pollution reduction 
benefits included 22 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 13 metric tons of 
nitrogen oxides, and 35 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Said Nike, "There 
are always ways to <I>Just Do It </I>better."<a href="#196" name="r196"> [ 196 ] </a>

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="CompaqComputerCorporation">Compaq Computer Corporation </a>. </B></I>Employees at Compaq 
Computer's Houston, Texas headquarters were pleased with a lighting 
upgrade that reduced both glare and reflections, while saving money and 
reducing the company's environmental impact. The company retrofitted older 
fixtures with two 40-watt enhanced T-10, 3,700 lumens, 80 CRI with 
24,000-hour life. Lighting energy usage fell 39 percent. Overall 
electricity consumption dropped by 1,307 megawatt-hours per year, saving 
$83,493 annually in energy costs. Annual pollution reduction benefits 
included 193 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 120 metric tons of nitrogen

install 10,300 T-8 lamps, 105 energy-efficient exit sign lamps, and 500 
occupancy sensors in its Tulsa Research Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Energy 
savings totaled 1,197 megawatt-hours per year, a cost savings of $124,883 
annually. Pollution reduction benefits include 34 metric tons of sulfur 
dioxide, 46 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 907 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide each year.<a href="#198" name="r198"> [ 198 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="WashingtonTimes,The">Washington Times<a>. </B></I>The Washington Times 
upgraded its headquarters facility in Washington, D.C. with 6,360 T-8's, 
1,151 compact fluorescents, 145 occupancy sensors, 409 halogen PAR lamps, 
and 153 LED exit signs. According to one receptionist, "I no longer feel 
heat on my head all day long. The light bulbs . . . are much cooler and 
give off better light than before. These lights have cured my headaches." 
Electricity savings annually amounted to 1,085 megawatt-hours and $72,810 
per year. Annual pollution-reduction benefits included 244 metric tons of 
sulfur dioxide, 77 metric tons of nitrogen oxides, and 1,293 metric tons 
of carbon dioxide.<a href="#199" name="r199"> [ 199 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     Bell Atlantic. </B></I><A NAME="BellAtlantic">Bell Atlantic </a>retrofitted all 
fluorescent fixtures at its Data Center in Richmond, Virginia with T-8's

<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="McDonald'sCorporation">McDonald's Corporation<a>. </B></I>McDonald's Corporation is 
engaged in a nationwide effort to upgrade existing 4-lamp fluorescent 
fixtures with T-8 lamps and electronic ballasts. The average results for 
one McDonald's restaurant, based on a sample of more than 200 stores in 
the northeastern United States, include electricity reductions of 30 
megawatt-hours at a savings of $2,260 per year - reflecting a 38 
percent internal rate of return. Carbon dioxide reductions total 19 metric 
tons per store annually, equivalent to taking 4 cars off the road per 
year. In the words of Joe Megacz, corporate utilities manager, "The energy 
savings numbers per store may be modest, but when you multiply them by the 
1,500 company-owned restaurants we have committed to the Green Lights 
program, the total becomes significant."<a href="#201" name="r201"> [ 201 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     Provo, Utah's City Hall. </B></I>The city of Provo, 
Utah - which developed the first prototype hydrogen-powered 
mass-transit bus back in 1974 - upgraded its City Hall with a 
combination of T-8s, compact fluorescents, and high-pressure sodium lamps. 
The result saves 709 megawatt-hours of electricity each year and reduces 
the city's electricity cost $36,678 annually, reflecting a 22 percent 
internal rate of return. The lessened electricity demand prevents 640 
metric tons of annual carbon dioxide emissions. In the words of Alan 
Dewitt, Provo facility manager, "[w]e are committed to energy efficiency 
as a <I>city</I>. By making our buildings more efficient, we have become a

Marquis Hotel has extensively upgraded its 1,825,726-square- foot 
facility. The upgrade included the addition of an Energy Management 
System. Guest room upgrades alone replaced 10,009 incandescent lamps with 
compact quad-tube lamps. Total annual electricity reductions were 2,556 
megawatt-hours, which saves $190,033 each year - an internal rate of 
return of 100 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions were cut by 1,201 metric 
tons each year, equivalent to taking 264 cars off the road per year. 
According to Ed Pietzak, director of engineering, "The hotel used less 
electricity in 1994 than it did in 1986, despite the guest room occupancy 
rates <I>increasing</I> from 64.8 percent to over 90 percent&#138; The 
experience of the hotel shows that even with relatively new facilities and 
increasing occupancy rates, significant savings can be achieved."<a href="#203" name="r203"> [ 203 ] </a>

reflectors. Electricity usage has dropped by 31,974 megawatt-hours per 
year, saving $3,453,166 annually, which represents an 83 percent internal 
rate of return. Annual carbon dioxide emissions have been reduced by 
21,966 metric tons. David Alexander, facilities manager, says, "It became 
apparent after our upgrades that we not only saved the expected energy, 
but also that the visual acuity of our customers and employees was 
dramatically improved. After upgrading our store's lighting, we learned 
that saving energy in lighting does not have to mean working in a 
cave."<a href="#204" name="r204"> [ 204 ] </a>

Corporation/U.S. Steel Group listened to employees' suggestions to upgrade 
to section lighting and timers in the company's Caster Spares Building in 
Gary, Indiana. The workers designed a lighting system that saves the Gary 
plant $120,892 annually while cutting electricity usage by 2,628 
megawatt-hours per year. The upgrade changed 748 400-watt mercury vapor 
lamps to 403 600-watt high pressure sodium lamps, which operate 87 percent 
fewer hours per year under timed switching devices. Annual pollution 
reduction benefits include 784 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 264 metric 
tons of nitrogen oxides, and 2,588 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Tim 
Briney, plant coordinator at the Gary plant, had this to say: "We listen 
to the workers in our facilities. And they wanted to upgrade their 
lighting."<a href="#205" name="r205"> [ 205 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     The County of San Diego. </B></I>San Diego County, 
California sought to upgrade lighting in as many of its 610 buildings as 
possible. In the words of Tom DuMont, deputy director of facility 
services, "Our experience has demonstrated that the commitment and 
involvement of directors and top managers provide the momentum to start 
and maintain an aggressive, major relighting program, and to ensure that 
the financial benefits are well understood by executive, financial, and 
administrative officials." At its Operations Center Annex, the county 
upgraded a combination of T-12s and incandescent lamps to T-8s and compact 
quad-tubes, saving 1,063 megawatt-hours and $99,009 annually. 
Pollution-reduction benefits include 22 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 30

emissions annually.<a href="#206" name="r206"> [ 206 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="MassachusettsInstituteofTechnology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology<a>. </B></I>The 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts upgraded 
campus lighting with approximately 225,000 T-8 lamps, 100,000 electronic 
ballasts, 3,000 reflectors and 2,500 new fixtures. Electricity demand 
dropped by 12,278 megawatt-hours per year, saving $982,241 annually - a 
13 percent internal rate of return. William Wohlfarth, P.E., senior 
electrical engineer for the school, noted that the upgrade was "well 
received by facility users. The improved color rendition was observed 
immediately, and people noted better depth perception and clearer, cleaner 
spaces. My advice to other organizations is to spend time obtaining good 
initial surveys and accurate run hours. Also, you should standardize on 
upgrade materials as much as practical, and negotiate large quantity 
material prices." MIT's upgrade avoids 8,128 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions annually, equivalent to taking 1,790 cars off the road each 
year.<a href="#207" name="r207"> [ 207 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="Johnson&Johnson">Johnson & Johnson<a>. </B></I>At Johnson & Johnson's McNeil 
Consumer Products Company in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, nearly all 
buildings received lighting upgrades, including buildings performing such 
diverse functions as manufacturing, product packaging, administration, 
research, warehousing, food service, and child development. The light 
quality has greatly improved and maintenance has been reduced. By 
converting all 6,000 inefficient fluorescents to T-8s and T-10s, all 
incandescents to compact fluorescents, and all exit signs to LED or 
compact fluorescents, the facility is saving 1,373 megawatt-hours per year 
and cutting its energy bills by $107,574 annually. Pollution reduction 
benefits include 8 metric tons of sulfur dioxide, 3.7 metric tons of 
nitrogen oxides, and 800 metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. 
Spokesman Mike Vlasic notes that "with the money we are saving . . . we 
have expanded into other energy saving products - such as motion 
sensors and exit lights - and enhanced our energy management 
system."<a href="#208" name="r208"> [ 208 ] </a>
