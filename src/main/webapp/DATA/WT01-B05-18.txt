<H1>Tour de Sol Email from the Race</H1>


Date: Mon, 22 May 1995 
From: Michael H Bianchi <bianchi@bellcore.com>

<H3>Subject: American Tour de Sol, 1995: The Race Begins</H3> 

I have no official results yet, but I thought I would at least tell you that
the race did in fact start and most of the vehicles made it from Waterbury CT
to Northampton MA. Various tid-bits:<P>
<UL>
<LI>      The electric bus did not run the first leg, as planned.  With it's very
          limited range and speed, it was decided that it will only start running
           today; at least that is my unofficial understanding.
<LI>     The "Wild Cherry" motor bike run by the WE'RE IT team was not ready at
           the start.  They were having trouble with their DC-DC converter and
           wiring.  
<LI>     The Electric Fiero had problems with 3 overheating batteries and                       decided to quit after about 30 miles.  They are going to try again tomorrow.
<LI>     The Envirocycle III didn't have enough torque to climb a long hill at
           the beginning of the course.  
<LI>     The Solar Flyer blew a tire.  The support vehicle for the Polytech
           Charger, number 75, (which I haven't written about yet), had an old
           fashioned vulcanizing patching kit, and Solar Flyer was able to continue
           on its way.
<LI>     Wooster's Charge (also not reported on yet) made it all the way, but had
            problems with their brakes overheating.  After those long hills to climb, there were long hills to decend, at 20 to 35 mph.  They stopped,
  cooled their brakes with water, and then continued to the finish.
<LI>     At one point I saw the Ottowa Orange trailer, but could not see the car.     I thought they  might  be in the trailer, but a few miles down the road
  there was Ottowa Orange, going along just fine.  They made it all the way   to the finish line.
<LI>     I saw the Mach .05 sitting at the side of the road, and thought they     might be in trouble, but they said they were just collecting some sun to
    boost the batteries a bit more.  I don't know if they made it all the way.
   By the way, Mach .05 is 38 mph, which was the top speed of the car last
   year.  Now it can do 47.2 mph according Jason Butterfield, a team member.
<LI>     The ERANGE motor bike was about 5 miles from the finish, at the side of
    the road, resting their batteries.  I think they eventually crossed the
   finish line.
