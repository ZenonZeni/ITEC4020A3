<H1>Uses of Pre-employment Tests in Selection Procedures</H1><P>
<AU>by Bill Angus</AU></CENTER><P>
Information in making hiring decisions is generally regarded to come from three sources...<P>
<OL>
<LI>Employment History and Resume</LI>
<LI>Standardized tests, </LI>
<LI>Interviewer impressions.</LI>
</OL>
Of these three sources, Interview has traditionally been the measure most relied on in making hiring decisions. Research suggests that this is entirely the wrong approach, as interview impressions are probably the least likely predictors of job success of the three sources of information listed above.<P>

History is the best indicator we have. Experience shows that past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. However an "honest" history can be difficult to obtain. If an employee was well liked or considered a personal friend by a previous employer, even though his/her previous employer was never highly satisfied with the quality of work produced and effort on the job, you could receive a glowing recommendation. Of course, if the employee was well-liked at previous places of employment, it may be that you will come to like this employee as well. The lesson to take from the information presented in this paragraph is: always check the history and references provided on the resume, verify somehow that the person you have been given as a reference is in fact someone who supervises employees, and question any gaps in the chronology of employment provided by the candidate. With regard to chronology, it could be that a previous employment where the individual got into trouble was omitted from the history, or it could be that the individual is someone who becomes periodically unable to work due to physical or mental health problems.<P>

Tests of maximum performance are used to identify the abilities of a prospective employee. Test results should be used to debunk the information obtained about employment history. Note that candidates can "fake bad" on these tests, but unless they have seen the test before, they cannot give a false-positive evaluation. This is not to say that aptitude tests are perfect measures of job performance.  These tests do nothing to measure important personality characteristics such as honestly, reliability, job involvement, customer service orientation, team spirit, etc.  Further they do a less than perfect job of measuring the elusive variable known as common sense which is important in the workplace. Our best estimates suggest that test results by themselves probably account for about 25% of the variance in job performance (Sternberg, American Psychologist vol 50 #11, Nov. 1995).<P>

What we hope to find in examining all three sources of information about an individual is convergence. For if three sources of information seem to indicate roughly the same things about an individual, then the probability that the "things" are correct increases. By contrast, divergence (where one source seems to contradict another) presents a problem that must be dealt with by the personnel manager. Further investigation will hopefully uncover a possible explanation for the contradictory information.<P>

Pre-employment tests should allow an individual to demonstrate a measurable amount of success and a measurable amount of failure on the task provided. I.E. if an individual gets most of the test items correct, it may be that the test is too "easy" to rate the individual accurately. The individual may even have more ability than the test results indicate. Test results are usually reported in terms of percentile ranks and/or standard scores. For those not trained in testing, I suggest sticking to percentile rank interpretation. A candidate scoring at the 90th %段le can be expected to score better than 89% of the reference group which the standardization sample represents and worse than 9% of the reference group. It is not true that getting 90 percent of the test items correct necessarily means that the individual scores at the 90th %段le. %段le scores are derived from a table in the test manual. If you are unsure of how to use %段le scores, get a good organizational psychologist or personnel manager to help you set a cutting score for each of the tests you want to use. Usually you can identify a score for each test below which an individual should not be hired, a range of scores where you might hire the individual if you were under time pressure to fill the position, and a score above which you would like your candidates to score. Do not assume that the highest test scores necessarily indicate the best prospective employee. This would be incorrect, as one can deduce from the preceding discussion above in which it is noted that probably only 25% of the variance in the ability of prospective employees is accounted for by pre-employment tests. Note: never average test results from different tests together. %段le ranks are not equal interval scores. For example there are many more people who fall between the 50th and 55th %段le than fall between the 90th and 95th %段le. <P>

Although we have dealt only with tests of maximum performance so far, a word needs to be said about "personality tests" and "honesty and reliability tests". I believe that personality assessments should be performed using respected objective tests and should generally be done by (or under the supervision of) an experienced industrial psychologist. This is not to insult personnel managers (or inexperienced psychologists), but rather to say that personality tests generally require interpretation. The ability to provide this interpretation is a skill which is developed after a good deal of experience. Personality tests generally lend themselves to manipulation by examinees much more than do tests of maximum performance. Even though the best of these tests have scales that attempt to detect dissimulation on the part of examinees, they are necessarily less reliable than tests of maximum performance. They are said to operate in a "softer" area and users should be advised that such tests can provide both false-positive and false-negative scores.<P>

Despite the problems with personality assessment, some tests have been devised specifically for use by personnel managers in measuring some aspects of employee reliability. These tests tend to be quite expensive (in the order of $30.00 per examinee). Test developers have justified the price of these tests based on development costs and potential savings arising from not hiring employees who steal, who are unreliable, or even those who are likely to take stress leave or abuse the company benefits plan. Human resources managers should always remember that the administration of one or more personality test tests is not the same thing as a comprehensive personality assessment provided by an organizational psychologist. A comprehensive pre-employment assessment by an industrial psychologist should include ability and personality measures, plus an extensive interview.  These assessments typically cost in the neighborhood of $500 - $1,000 per candidate, and should be based on an hourly rate charged by the psychologist. The professional psychologists association in your region will usually have a published recommended rate schedule for their members which may be used to verify that quoted charges for candidate assessments are within reason.  Bear in mind that Psychologists with training in industrial/organizational work should be entitled to charge slightly more than the minimum recommended rates, due to the demand for their specialization.<P>
