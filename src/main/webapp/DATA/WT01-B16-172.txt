<TITLE>Asthma</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><P>Asthma is a disease of the lungs and bronchial tubes. It
causes shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing. It is often related to allergies
or cigarette smoking. Sometimes it is initiated by exercise.
<P>Treating asthma involves using bronchodilators that relax tight muscles
in the bronchial tubes. Medications for inflamation and mucus are also very
important. Treatment of allergies is helpful.
<P>Asthma can be very serious or even fatal if not properly treated. We can
provide a complete program of treatment in this office.
