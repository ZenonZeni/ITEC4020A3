<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>January 11,1995, will mark
the 50th anniversary of the public release of </b><em><b>The Marihuana
Problem in the City of New York: Sociological, Medical, Psychological
and Pharmacological Studies</b></em><b> (&quot;The LaGuardia
Report&quot;).</b>&nbsp; The study was commissioned by Mayor
Fiorello LaGuardia in 1938 in order to discover the truth about
marijuana, which had been hastily prohibited a year earlier. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The study was completed in 1944,
published by Jaques Cattell Press (Lancaster, PA), and released
to the public in early 1945.&nbsp; <b>&quot;Its findings revealed
that marijuana's harmful effects had been greatly
exaggerated,&quot; explained NORML National Director Richard
Cowan.&nbsp; &quot;The report's conclusions demonstrate that the
War Against Marijuana Consumers has been a fraud from its
beginning.&quot;</b> </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The massive research project was
carried out by a team of scientists from the New York Academy of
Medicine and the commissioners of the New York Departments of Correction,
Health, and Hospitals.&nbsp; It was the most thorough, extensive
marijuana fact-finding mission since the Indian Hemp Drugs
Commission released its monumental report in 1894. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The LaGuardia Report was
comprised of a series of studies -- from sociological observations
to controlled, scientific studies involving the consumption of
marijuana by subjects in a laboratory setting.&nbsp; <b>Among the
report's conclusions:</b> </font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Mental Illness --</b>
        &quot;Indulgence in marihuana does not appear to result
        in mental deterioration.&nbsp; ... Marihuana does not
        change the basic personality structure of the
        individual.&nbsp; It lessens inhibition and this brings
        out what is latent in his thoughts and emotions but it
        does not evoke responses which would otherwise be totally
        alien to him.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Violence --</b>
        &quot;There was no aggressive or violent behavior
        observed.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Crime --</b>
        &quot;Marihuana is not the determining factor in the
        commission of major crimes.&nbsp; Juvenile delinquency is
        not associated with the practice of smoking marihuana.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Addiction --</b>
        &quot;The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to
        addiction in the medical sense of the word.&quot; </font></li>
    <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><b>Gateway to Hard Drugs --</b>
        &quot;We have been unable to confirm ... that marihuana smoking
        is the first step in the use of such drugs as cocaine,
        morphine, and heroin.&nbsp; The instances are extremely
        rare where the habit of marihuana smoking is associated
        with addiction to these other narcotics.&quot; </font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In sum, the report stressed,
&quot;The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana
smoking in New York City is unfounded.&quot;&nbsp; The depth and
thoroughness of the study make these conclusions relevant beyond
1940s New York. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The LaGuardia Report provided
invaluable descriptive data and dispelled many of the myths which
led to the prohibition of marijuana.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was
essentially ignored and had virtually no effect on the burgeoning
national policy of prohibition. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The January 12,1945, <i>New York
Times</i> article &quot;Experts Discount Marijuana as Big Factor
In Crime but Drive on It Will Be Pressed&quot; reassured a
frightened public that marijuana would remain outlawed.&nbsp;
Every large-scale study done over the last century has arrived at
the same conclusion; all have been ignored. </font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Of course, prohibitionists have
played an active part in making sure that the reports are
ignored.&nbsp; Today they claim that marijuana is now so much
stronger than it was in the past that it is virtually a different
drug, rendering all previous conclusions useless.&nbsp; For
example, the December 26 <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> blamed
a rap album for promoting marijuana &quot;20 times stronger than
grass of the past&quot; (&quot;Kids and Marijuana: The Glamour is
Back,&quot; p. 12).&nbsp; In actuality, potency has not
substantially increased over the past 20 years.&nbsp; (A report
on marijuana potency is available from NORML.) </font></p>
