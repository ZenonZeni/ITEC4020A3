<P>Matra Datavision, Inc. (Andover, MA), according to company figures, is the 8th-largest mechanical CAD/CAM/CAE software vendor in the world. Its CAM software is said to be #1. European (Renault, with over 1,000 seats, is its biggest customer) and Asian (Toyota is a user) companies seem to like it, if revenue figures can be used as basis of assessment. Yet in the U.S., it is a comparatively small player.

<P>So Matra Datavision is bringing to market what it--and several consultants--consider to be extremely powerful stuff. In announcing Euclid Quantum, a suite of CAD/CAM/CAE/PDM products, chairman &amp; CEO Michel Neuve Eglise claims, &quot;We are three years ahead of the competition in terms of technology.&quot; They have also invested, he says, in excess of $100-million in developing Euclid Quantum and CAS.CADE, the latter being the underlying framework that permits fast and efficient 
software program development. &quot;It's not just the money,&quot; remarks Bruce Boes, the company's vice president of Operations. &quot;It's also the time--you can't do this overnight.&quot; It's taken them five years. They started anew; they didn't modify something that exists.

<P>Bruce Jenkens, vice president of Daratech, Inc. (Cambridge, MA), a firm that tracks what goes on in the CAD/CAM/CAE technical space, says that Euclid Quantum is (1) founded on next-generation core technologies; (2) sets new standards in openness, extensibility, programmability, and enterprise scaleability; and (3) is architected for &quot;orders of magnitude improvement&quot; in 
users' operations. The product is referred to as representing &quot;breakthrough technology and vision.&quot;

<P>Matra Datavision is being aggressive on pricing. In addition to a limited-time introductory offer, Matra Datavision, Boes says, has established a pricing policy wherein Euclid Quantum packages will be offered at 80% the price of the &quot;closest comparative package.&quot;

<P>One of the most-important technical/business factors of Euclid Quantum is that <B>it is based on a native STEP format</B>, which means data translations from proprietary formats are not an issue. (There are translation packages available for moving data from packages including Catia and CADDS.)

<P>Openness is further underlined by the fact that 
<B>it runs on UNIX, Windows NT and Windows 95</B>.
<P>An interesting characteristic of Euclid Quantum is that it includes a &quot;Web-enabled&quot; product data management (PDM) system, Euclid Design Manager. Yes, this means that <B>there is a Netscape browser</B> built right in. The beauty of this is that files, objects, geometry, text, video, and audio can be exchanged between customers and suppliers via the World Wide Web. An objective is to create what Boes calls &quot;collaborative concurrent engineering,&quot; which means that not only are all parties working with the current information (one of the benefits of a PDM package), but they are able to collaborate through improved information exchange.

<P>The foundation package is Euclid Designer. <B>Surfaces, solids and assemblies are in a single CAD model</B>. There is a feature-based modeling approach which means that parametric or variational solvers are automatically selected. An associative bi-directional drawing capability means 2D changes are reflected in the 3D model and vice versa. It is based on an object-oriented database, which means this is more than geometry; mechanical information is also included.

<P>The next step is to Euclid Analyst, which permits 
<B>analysis on the CAD model geometry</B>. This helps speed the process since the CAD model created, not a recreation of the model, is what's worked with for analysis. Within the Designer package there's an electronic notebook that allows designers to include information about such things as constraints and other 
features--design intent info. Similarly, Analyst has an Analysis Reporter for analysis intent and information about previous runs.

<P>Then there's Euclid Machinist. &quot;Our <B>models are 100% machinable</B>,&quot; Boes says. &quot;We just don't create cool images.&quot; It is a feature-based package. Geometry and information about the operation are used as a basis for programming the machining operation. Prompts can help reduce programming time. An Instant Cycle Update feature speeds the simulation of various machining approaches.
