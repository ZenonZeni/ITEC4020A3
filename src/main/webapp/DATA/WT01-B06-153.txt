<h3>History of the Gerson Therapy</h3>

<a href="ward.html"><h3>by Dr. Patricia Spain Ward</h3></a>



<p>It is one of the least edifying facts of recent American medical history that

the profession's leadership so long rejected as quackish the idea that

nutrition affects health (JAMA 1946 1949, 1977; Shimkin, 1976).  Ignoring both

the empirical dietary wisdom that pervaded western medicine from the

pre-Christian Hippocratic era until the late nineteenth century and a

persuasive body of modern research in nutritional biochemistry, the

politically minded spokesmen of organized medicine in the U.S.  remained 

long committed to surgery and radiation as the sole acceptable treatments for

cancer.  This commitment persisted, even after sound epidemiological data

showed that early detection and removal of malignant tumors did not "cure"

most kinds of cancer (Crile, 1956; updated by Cairns, 1985).



<p>The historical record shows that progress lagged especially in cancer

immunotherapy - including nutrition and hyperthermia - because power over

professional affiliation and publication (and hence over practice and

research) rested with men who were neither scholars nor practitioners nor

researchers themselves, and who were often unequipped to grasp the rapidly

evolving complexities of the sciences underlying mid-twentieth-century

medicine.



<p>Nowhere is this maladaption of professional structure to medicine's changing

scientific context more tragically illustrated than in the American experience

of Max B. Gerson (1881- 1959), founder of the best-known nutritional treatment

for cancer of the pre-macrobiotic era.  A scholar's scholar and a superlative

observer of clinical phenomena, Gerson was a product of the German medical

education which Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries considered

so superior to our own that all who could afford it went to Germany to perfect

their training (Bonner, 1963). As a medical graduate of the University of

Freiburg in 1909, Gerson imbibed all of the latest in scientific medicine,

with the emphasis on specificity which bacteriology had brought into western

medical thought in the preceding decades. Gerson subsequently worked with

leading German specialists in internal medicine, in physiological chemistry,

and in neurology (U.S. Congress, 1946, 98). The historical record does not

tell us whether his medical education in Germany (where much of the early work

in nutritional chemistry took place) included a study of diet, a subject

neglected in American medical schools after the germ theory gained acceptance.



<p>We do know that by 1919, when Gerson set up a practice in internal and nervous

diseases in Bielefeld, he had devised an effective dietary treatment for the

migraine headaches which frequently disabled him, despite the best efforts of

his colleagues. In 1920, while treating migraine patients by this salt-free

vegetarian diet, he discovered that it was also effective in lupus vulgaris

(tuberculosis of the skin, then considered incurable) and, later, in arthritis

as well (U.S. Congress, 1946, 98).



<p>Trained in the theories of specific disease causation and treatment that began

to dominate western medicine - for the first time in history - as

bacteriological discoveries multiplied in the late nineteenth century, Gerson

was at first uneasy about using a single therapy in such seemingly disparate

conditions.  But he was committed to the primacy of clinical evidence, which

he liked to express in Kussmaul's dictum: "The result at the sick-bed is

decisive" (quoted in Gerson, 1958, 212).  In later years, after research began

to provide explanations for Gerson's clinical observations, he quoted

Churchill on the mistaken course of action he had thus avoided: "Men

occasionally stumble over the truth, but most pick themselves up and hurry off

as if nothing had happened" (Gerson, 1958, 212).  Gerson persisted. In 1924

his success in treating tuberculosis of the skin brought an invitation from

the noted thoracic surgeon, Ferdinand Sauerbruch, to test Gerson's diet in a

special lupus clinic to be provided by the Bavarian government at the

University of Munich. As Sauerbruch recounts it in his autobiography, 446

patients out of 450 recovered - once he had discovered and put an end to the

smuggling of sausages, cream and beer to the patients in the late afternoons (

Sauerbruch, 1953, 167- 171 ).  Later extended to pulmonary tuberculosis as

well, this Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet was widely used in Germany

and became the subject of Gerson's first book in 1934 (Gerson, 1934;

Hildenbrand, 1987 communication).



<p>During the late twenties and early thirties Gerson had several experiences

which informed his later thinking on diet and degenerative disease. As a

member of the State Board of Health, appointed by the Prussian government, he

was given extraordinary laboratory support for a clinical trial of diet in

pulmonary tuberculosis.  Besides the physiological parameters customarily

monitored in such work, Gerson was able to track minute fluctuations in the

patients' mineral metabolism and also in the chemical composition of the foods

he prescribed (Gerson, 1958, 183). At this same period he served as consultant

to the Prussian Ministry of Health on the best ways to restore to agricultural

usefulness the exhausted soil around several major German cities (Gerson,

1958, 183). When he learned that modern farming methods often rob plant foods

of their natural mineral and vitamin riches, while increasing their sodium

content, he began to think of the earth's well-being as central to our own.

Eventually he began to refer to the soil, which nourishes the food we eat, as

our "external metabolism" (Gerson 1958, 175). 



<p>It was in 1928 that Gerson first used his diet in cancer, at the insistence of

a woman who had jaundice, high fever and two small liver metastases after

unsuccessful surgery for cancer of the bile duct (Gerson, 1958, 31). On the

strength of reports she had heard of Gerson's work with tuberculosis, this

woman insisted that he write out a diet for the treatment of her cancer.

Gerson reluctantly agreed - after he obtained her signed statement that she

would not hold him responsible for the outcome!  As he recalled it many years

later, this same patient had him read aloud to her a chapter called "The

Healing of Cancer" from a big book of about 1200 pages on folk medicine, "

edited by three schoolteachers and one physician, none of them practitioners.

It was from this source that Gerson first learned of the special soup which

Hippocrates supposedly gave to cancer patients and which Gerson made a fixture

of his cancer Therapy (Gerson, 1958, 31, 403-404; Gerson, 1978, 449-450).

Having taken up this challenge against his will, with no hope of success,

Gerson was astounded when his patient seemed fully recovered within six months

(Gerson, 1958, 405). In quick succession he had the same good results with two

patients with inoperable stomach cancer, both referred by this first patient.

Late in life he continues to marvel at these apparent recoveries under his

diet treatment (Gerson, 1958, 404- 405). (These notable histories, which

Gerson recounted in some detail, have prompted one recent researcher to

suggest the possible involvement of aldoslerone as the mechanism of

mineral-corticoid sensitivity in gastrointestinal tumors.  See McCarty, 1981).



<p>In Vienna, where he lived for a time after the rise of Hitler, Gerson's

treatment failed in all seven patients he attempted to treat in this manner -

a failure which, in later years, he attributed to inadequate dietary

provisions in the sanitarium where he then worked (Gerson, 1958, 31-32, 405).

In Paris, where he lived in 1935-36, the diet produced good results in three

out of seven cases (Gerson, 1958, 32, 405; Gerson, 1978, 451), inspiring him

to pursue such treatment further after he emigrated to the United States in

1938.



<p>Gerson constantly sought explanations for his observations in the scientific

literature, where he read widely in several languages (Gerson, 1958). In 1954,

in "Cancer, a Problem of Metabolism," he credited J. Maisin (1923) and B.

Fischer-Wasels (1929) with advancing physiological explanations of general

predisposition toward tumor formation and abandoning the theory of cancer

causation by local irritation.  For the next few decades (according to

Gerson's account of the evolution of cancer concepts) there was a tendency to

interpret cancer in terms of constitution and diathesis, as was done with

diabetes, gout and tuberculosis. It was Caspari (Nutrition and Cancer, 1938)

who turned to metabolic explanation of the kind Gerson ultimately favored

(Gerson, 1954, 1). He devoted an entire chapter of his book to a review of

efforts, largely by German researchers, to alter metabolism by diet (Gerson,

1958, 89-104). He found special appeal in Otto Warburg, The Metabolism of

Tumors, (London, 1930), in G. von Bergmann's Funktionelle Pathologie (Berlin,

1932), and in Frederick Hoffman's massive compilation, Cancer and Diet

(Baltimore, 1937).  Gradually, out of his bedside experience and his reading,

he formed a unitary theory of degenerative disease (including cancer) which

rested on one of the oldest and most pervasive concepts in the history of

medicine: the vis medicatrix naturae or healing power of nature (Neuburger,

1926 and 1944; Warner, 1978). Endlessly seeking out the latest researches and

theories in physiology, biochemistry, and - increasingly - immunology, Gerson

rapidly integrated these massive bodies of new detail into the larger

framework of what he called "the physician within", that is, the natural powers of resistance,
which we today call the immune system.



<p>Gerson believed that cancer changes the body's normal sodium/potassium

balance, already disturbed by modern diet. Thus his therapy used foods low in

sodium (no salt added), high in potassium, and rich in vitamins A and C and

oxidizing enzymes. He excluded fats and dairy products for the first four to

six weeks, considering them dangerously burdensome to the digestion in the

extremely sick patients who usually came to him only after having exhausted

conventional measures.  Above all it was essential for patients to eliminate

excess sodium, which Gerson believed responsible for altering cellular

electrochemistry in favor of cancerous growth.



<p>There is now a great deal of research suggesting possible mechanisms for the

efficacy of Gerson's high potassium/low sodium diet. As he suspected and we

now know, hypokalemia often accompanies cancer of the colon, and alterations

in electrical and mineral states occur often in cancer patients (Newell, 1981,

87). Cone has furnished experimental proof of a correlation between the level

of electrical potential across somatic cell membranes and the intensity of

mitotic activity (Cone, 1971 ), a finding supported by Zs.-Nagy and his

colleagues in studies so human thyroid cancer (Zs. -Nagy, 1983) .  Ling's

association/induction hypothesis is based on laboratory studies which show

that damaged cells partially return to their normal configuration in high

potassium/low sodium environments (Ling, 1943), perhaps explaining the

remarkable tissue repair which Gerson sometimes saw in his formerly

debilitated patients (Cope, 1978). Lai has suggested that intracellular sodium

and potassium levels may furnish the mechanism for regulating cellular

differentiation and transformation (Lai, 1985) .



<p>To supply active oxidation enzymes and potassium-rich minerals, Gerson's

patients drank hourly glasses of freshly prepared vegetable and fruit juices.

As early as 1933-34, while living in Vienna, Gerson had begun giving

injections of liver extract, as another means of stimulating the patient's

liver (Gerson, 1958, 31 -32).  In later years he had patients drink two to

three glasses daily of the juice of calves' liver pressed with carrots.  In

addition to beta-carotene/vitamin A, this would supply iron and copper, both

of which affect peripheral T cell functions and other peripheral lymphocyte

subpopulations (Keusch, 1983, 345- 347).  



<p>Although the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that diet can affect cancer, recent researchers have found that

"nutritional status plays a critical role in immunological defense mechanisms

at a number of important levels" (Keusch, 1983, 345) and that nutritional

factors "can have profound influences on ... the development and

manifestations of cancers" as well as other diseases (Good, 1982, 85). In "The

Cancerostatic Effect of Vegetarian Diets" ( 1983), Siguel describes as the

ideal way to strengthen bodily defenses against neoplastic cells a diet

similar to Gerson's: high in carbohydrates and vegetables, low in protein.


<p>Like von Bergmann, Gerson believed that "every defense and healing power of

the body depends on the capacity of the body to produce a so-called 'allergic

inflammation'"- a truth long recognized by surgeons, but somehow forgotten by

medicine during the heyday of microbiology.  To Gerson this capacity to

produce inflammation was "the decisive part of the body's 'weapon of healing

power'" (Gerson, 1958, 127-28).



<p>Noting that fluid from a normal inflammation metabolism kills cancer cells,

but that blood serum does not, von Bergmann concluded that a cancer metabolism

occurs when the body can no longer produce this healing inflammatory reaction

(Gerson, 1958, 120- 121 ). Gerson agreed, but in contrast to von Bergmann and

most of his contemporaries, Gerson believed it was often possible for the

physician to help restore the vital power of inflammation, even in anergic

patients with advanced cancer. If cancer was a degenerative disease caused by

the cumulative effect of inadequate nutrition with foods grown in soils

depleted by artificial fertilizers and poisoned by toxic insecticides and

herbicides, doctors must respond by replenishing the entire human organism.

For a condition that represented an ultimate failure of equilibrium in a

poisoned metabolism, removal of tumors by surgery or radiation was merely

superficial, symptomatic treatment.  "Medicine," Gerson said, "must be able to

adapt its therapeutic methods to the damages of the processes of our modern

civilization" (Gerson, 1958, 199).



<p>Gerson set about doing this by altering the basic diet he had used earlier in

other conditions. Through meticulous observation of his patients in New York

(where he passed state boards in 1939), he perfected a regimen of detoxication

and diet requiring a high degree of compliance by the patient, heroic devotion

by the patient's family, and close attention and frequent adjustment by the

physician.  His therapy aimed to detoxify the body and restore its healing

apparatus, especially the liver, the visceral nervous system, and the

reticulo-mesenchymal system.



<p>Gerson first encountered the idea of detoxication in cancer in the version of

Hippocratic regimen which he read with his first cancer patient in Bielefeld

in 1928 (Gerson, 1958, 404). After losing several cancer patients to hepatic

coma rather than to direct effects of the disease (Gerson, 1958, 191 ), he

realized that "The digestive tract is very much poisoned in cancer'.  The

liver and pancreas failed to function: "nothing is active" (Gerson, 1958,

407). To stimulate the liver, he began to use coffee enemas, which 0.A.  Meyer

of Goettingen had found effective in opening the bile ducts in animals and

which American surgeons in that period were using in acute adrenal

insufficiency and in shock from postoperative hemorrhage and bleeding peptic

ulcer (Beeson, 1980, 90, 96; Rothstein, 1987, 124). As he watched the progress

of his patients, he found that he could accelerate detoxication by giving

coffee enemas more frequently, with the addition of castor oil, by mouth and

by rectum (Gerson, 1958, 81).



<p>Although Gerson used caffeine enemas primarily to facilitate excretion of

toxic wastes, especially from necrosing tumors, we now realize that these

enemas also promoted the absorption of vitamin A, a process requiring the

action of bile acids (Simone, 1943, 64). Thus the enemas that brought ridicule

from Gerson's enemies actually enabled his patients to use the enormous

amounts of vitamin A which his diet provided (recently estimated at about

100,000 IU daily: see Seifter, 1988). Vitamin A, in turn, plays a vital role

in immune function, perhaps by causing the helper cells to induce the

production of interleukin-2, or by causing killer cell precursors to activate

cytotoxic mechanisms, or by causing suppressor T cells to eliminate down

regulation (Keusch, 1983, 330-331 ).



<p>Gerson also found that caffeine enemas greatly reduce pain, a particular boon

in his regimen, which avoids the use of opiates and other painkilling drugs

that might overtax the liver at a time when its limited capacity is needed for

immune functions and for eliminating the toxic products of tumor breakdown.




<p>Although the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that diet can affect cancer, recent researchers have found that

"nutritional status plays a critical role in immunological defense mechanisms

at a number of important levels" (Keusch, 1983, 345) and that nutritional

factors "can have profound influences on ... the development and

manifestations of cancers" as well as other diseases (Good, 1982, 85). In "The

Cancerostatic Effect of Vegetarian Diets" ( 1983), Siguel describes as the

ideal way to strengthen bodily defenses against neoplastic cells a diet

similar to Gerson's: high in carbohydrates and vegetables, low in protein.



<p>Gerson gradually added a few medications to his diet.  One of these was

niacin, which he believed would help restore proper intracellular potential,

raise depleted liver stores of glycogen and potassium, and aid in protein

metabolism (Gerson, 1958, 32, 99- 100, 209). Another was iodine, which Gerson

initially used only in cases of low metabolic rates. When he found that "The

best range of healing power" was a BMR of +6 to +8 (monitored by organic

iodine in blood serum), and that iodine seemed to counteract the neoplastic

effect of hormones, he incorporated iodine into the basic regimen, at first in

the form of thyroid extract, later as inorganic Lugol's solution (iodine plus

potassium iodide) (Gerson, 1958, 32, 409; U.S. Congress, 1946, 114).  Several

researchers have showed that thyroid raises natural resistance to infection by

augmenting the power of reticuloendothelial cells and by increasing antibody

formation - thus supporting Gerson's hunch that iodine was a decisive factor

in the normal differentiation of cells (Lurie, 1960; Thorbecke, 1962).



<p>Despite the fact that he had no inpatient facility until 1946, when he opened

a clinic in Nanuet, New York, Gerson managed, through his thriving Park Avenue

practice and an affiliation at Gotham Hospital, to amass enough data to

publish a preliminary report in 1945. He presented his rather remarkable case

histories modestly, concluding that he did not yet have enough evidence to say

whether diet could either influence the origin of cancer or alter the course

of an established tumor. He claimed only that the diet, which he described in

considerable detail, could favorably affect the patient's general condition,

staving off the consequences of malignancy and making further treatment

possible (Gerson, 1945).



<p>Gerson may have struck an Establishment nerve with his statement that many

physicians use surgery and/or radiation "without systematic treatment of the

patient as a whole" (Gerson, 1945, 419). But it seems more likely that it was

his growing success in practice, or perhaps even his opposition to tobacco,

that first drew the wrath of organized medicine.  ( Philip Morris was then

JAMA's major source of advertising revenue: see Rorty, 1939, 182 - 194).



<p>In any case the AMA did not openly attack Gerson until November 1946, a few

months after he testified in support of a Senate bill to appropriate $100

million to bring together the world's outstanding cancer experts in order to

coordinate a search for the prevention and cure of cancer. At hearings before

Senator Claude Pepper's sub-committee in July 1946, Gerson demonstrated

recovered patients who had come to him after conventional methods could no

longer help.  Dr.  George Miley, medical director of the 85-bed Gotham

Hospital, where Gerson had treated patients since January, 1946, gave strong

supporting medical testimony (U.S. Congress, 1946).



<p>In a surly editorial response, JAMA said it was "fortunate" that this Senate

appearance received little newspaper publicity; the AMA was clearly outraged

that Gerson's appearance had become the subject of a favorable radio

commentary, broadcast nationwide by ABC's Raymond Gram Swing (U.S. Congress,

1946, 31-35; JAMA, 1946). The JAMA editorial focused on Gerson, even though it

was not Gerson but a lay witness, immune to AMA retaliation, who had called

Gerson's successes "miracles" and urged the Senators to secure their future

cancer commission against control by any existing medical organization (U.S.

Congress, 1946, 96,97).



<p>It was not Gerson, but Dr. Miley, who told the Senators that a long-term

survey by a well-known and respected physician showed that those who received

no cancer treatment lived longer than those who received surgery, radiation or

X-ray (U.S. Congress, 1946, 117).  Perhaps because Miley was a Northwestern

medical graduate, an established physician licensed in four states, and a

fellow of the AMA and state and county societies of Pennsylvania and New York,

Morris Fishbein did not attack him personally.  Instead, he limited himself to

intimations of fiscal impropriety in the Robinson Foundation, which owned

Miley's Gotham Hospital, and to the scandalous revelation that the director of

the section on health education of this Foundation (which was promoting "an

unestablished, somewhat questionable method of treating cancer") was not an

M.D. at all, but a Yale University professor of economics!



<p>Compared to Miley's testimony, Gerson's was innocent, concentrating on the

histories of the patients he brought with him and on the likely mechanisms

whereby his diet caused tumor regression and healing.  Only under pressure

from Senator Pepper did Gerson state that about 30% of those he treated showed

a favorable response ( U.S.  Congress, 1946, 115).  Nonetheless, JAMA devoted

two pages to undermining Gerson's integrity (JAMA, 1946). Showing no restraint

where Gerson was concerned, Fishbein, contrary to fact, alleged that successes

with the Gerson-Sauerbruch-Hermannsdorfer diet "were apparently not

susceptible of duplication by most other observers. " He also falsely claimed

that Gerson had several times refused to supply the AMA with details of the

diet. (Fishbein said he could provide them in this editorial only because

"there has come to hand through a prospective patient" of Gerson a diet

schedule for his treatment.)  Fishbein emphasized, without comment, Gerson's

caution about the use of other medications, especially anesthetics, because

they produced dangerously strong reactions in the heightened allergic state of

his most responsive patients.



<p>Fishbein attempted to tie together this strange patchwork of slurs against

Gerson and against research supported by lay-dominated industrial corporations

with his accustomed mastery of innuendo: "The entire performance, including

the financial backing, the promotion and the scientific reports, has a

peculiar effluvium which, to say the least, is distasteful and, at its worst,

creates doubt and suspicion" (JAMA, 1946, 646).



<p>Through no fault of his own, Gerson was again portrayed favorably in the news

in 1947, when John Gunther, in Death Be Not Proud, credited Gerson with

extending the life of Gunther's son during the boy's ultimately unsuccessful

struggle with brain cancer. Beginning that same year the New York County

Medical Society staged five "investigations" of Gerson and eventually

suspended him for "advertising" his "secret" methods.



<p>At this point Gerson's life took on a nightmare quality. The Pepper-Neely bill

met defeat and, with it, the hope for coordinated cancer research free of

prior restraints against investigations of anything other than "established"

methods. In 1949 the AMA Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry, in a report

entitled "Cancer and the Need for Facts", rehashed material from the earlier

editorial, adding that the Gerson diet was "lacking in essential protein and

fat" and that Gerson's concern about the dangers of anesthesia was "wholly

unfounded and apparently designed to appeal to the cancer victim already

fearful of a surgical operation which might offer the only effective means for

eradication of the disease".  Without benefit of either a literature search or

new clinical or laboratory research, the Council labeled as a "false notion"

the idea that "diet has any specific influence on the origin or progress of

cancer". They concluded that "There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to

indicate that modifications in the dietary intake of food or other nutritional

essentials are of any specific value in the control of cancer" (Council on

Pharmacy and Chemistry, 1949, 96). Gerson lost his hospital affiliation and

found that young doctors who wanted to assist him and learn from him could not

do so, for fear of incurring Society discipline.  He was denied malpractice

insurance, because his therapy was not "accepted practice" (Moss, 1980, 178;

Natenberg, 1959, 136).



<p>In the early fifties Gerson submitted five case histories to the NCI,

requesting an official investigation.  He was told that they would need 25

cases, which he promptly supplied, with full documentation.  More than a year

later the NCI demanded 125 case histories, saying that the 25 they had

previously requested were insufficient to justify investigation.



<p>According to a 1981 publication of the Gerson Institute, headed by his

daughter, Charlotte Gerson, a manuscript for a book he was writing about his

therapy disappeared from his files in 1956 (Healing, 1981, 19) At the age of

75, isolated from medical colleagues and unable to find assistants, Gerson

undertook the work of rewriting the entire manuscript in order to show "that

there is an effective treatment of cancer, even in advanced cases" (Gerson,

1958, 3). It was published in 1958, as A Cancer Therapy: Results of Fifty

Cases. Gerson died of pneumonia the following year, before finishing a second

volume. His ideas have gained wide distribution through subsequent editions of

his book (1975, 1977, and 1986); through a 1962 publication called Has Dr. Max

Gerson a True Cancer Cure?, which had reportedly sold more than 250,000 copies

by 1980 (Moss, 1980, 178); and through the publications and physician-training

programs of the Gerson Institute in Bonita, California, and the Hospital de

Baja California.



<p>In 1980 a reformed JAMA carried a commentary called "The 'Grand Conspiracy'

Against the Cancer Cure" by William Regelson of the Department of Medicine of

the Medical College of Virginia. Surveying a series of "inappropriate

judgments [that] have resulted in injury to good observations," Regelson said,

"We may shortly have to ask if Gerson's low-sodium diet, with its bizarre

coffee enemas and thyroid supplementation, was an approach that altered the

mitotic regulating effect of intracellular sodium for occasional clinical

validity in those patients with the stamina to survive it" (Regelson, 1980,

338).



<p>Disregarding such suggestions and resting its case instead on the claim that

the NCI had "found no convincing evidence of effectiveness" during a review of

ten Gerson cases some forty years earlier, the American Cancer Society in 1987

stated that "The Gerson method of cancer treatment is not considered a proven

means of cancer treatment, and on the basis of available information, the

Institute does not believe that further evaluation of this therapy is called

for at this time" (American Cancer Society, February 5, 1987).



<p>Testing is underway, however, outside of the U.S. Since 1984 a modified form

of Gerson's therapy has been in use at the Second Department of Surgery of the

Krankenhaus in Graz, Austria.  Omitting liver juice and niacin, using thyroid

only in hypothyroid patients, and limiting caffeine enemas to two per day,

Peter Lechner and his colleagues, all of them surgeons, have been testing the

Gerson method as an adjunct, often with chemotherapy or radiation, in 60

post-operative cancer patients, male and female, ranging in age from 23 to 74,

and representing many different forms of cancer. By pairing each patient who

was willing to use the Gerson method (GP) with one of similar age and

condition who chose not to try it (NGP) and observing the comparative progress

of the disease in the two groups over a four-year period, Lechner and his

colleagues have approximated a controlled study of admittedly imperfect

structure (Lechner, 198 7).



<p>Their findings show that the Gerson therapy made a notable difference in

several forms of cancer. Although GPs with bone metastases had no better

survival or tumor response than NGPs, their relief from pain and absence of

hypercalcemia made for a better quality of life.  GPs with lung metastases

required fewer procedures to relieve pleural effusion. GPs with brain

metastases experienced decreased edema and lived four months longer than their

paired NGPs.  Premenopausal and perimenopausal breast cancer GPs tolerated

conventional treatments better, with fewer side effects; showed better liver

and kidney function and blood counts; and had fewer local recurrences and no

metastases.  Breast cancer GPs with liver metastases tolerated chemotherapy

better, and one of three has been in a steady state for more than a year,

while the remaining five have died.  GPs with colorectal carcinoma seemed to

gain weight and recover better after surgery, but showed no significant

difference in incidence of secondaries or local recurrence. The best

responders to date are GPs with liver metastases, with two GPs showing

improved hepatic enzyme profiles compared to two NGPs; in four other pairs,

although profiles remained similar, the GPs lived twice as long as the NGPs

(Lechner, 1987).



<p>It is an irony of both history and geography that the first comparative study

of Max Gerson's therapy should take place at the hands of surgeons, in that

part of the world which Gerson fled as a Jewish refugee half a century ago and

that the results, while not so outstanding as those he seemed able to produce,

are most encouraging in patients with severe damage to the liver, the organ he

considered central to recovery.
