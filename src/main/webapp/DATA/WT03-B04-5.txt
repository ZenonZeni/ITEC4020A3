Cambodia: Inside the KR: Innocent people tortured into confessing to
'crimes' and executed by the Pol Pot regime

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chiep Mony

Many innocent people were tortured into confessing to various "crimes"
against the state during the four-year genocidal regime under the Khmer
Rouge.

After confessing, these people were summarily executed. Among those who
had fallen victim were officials of the Sangkum Reastr Niyum era of the
then-Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Republican regime of Lon Nol, anyone
believed to be an intellectual, such as students and teachers, as well
as all the civil servants of the previous governments.

Others who were considered "unimportant" people to the Pol Potists were
not even interrogated after being arrested by the authorities. They were
just executed immediately, said former Khmer Rouge information officer
Nhem Ein.

Nhem Ein met with the Cambodia Times again last week and revealed the
stories of the Khmer Rouge rule between 1975 and 1979.

He said that to monitor the many interrogations and executions
through-out the country, the Pol Pot government had set up the Toul Sleng
torture centre in 1977.

"The chief of the centre was Duch, his deputy was Hea while the person
in charge of translating documents from Vietnamese to Khmer was Chan,"
he said.

He said the three men led the executions carried out at the centre by
receiving orders direct from the central Khmer Rouge leadership.

Toul Sleng, measuring a square km, was the main Khmer Rouge interrogation
and torture centre and could be considered the ministry of interior
during the guerilla regime.

Nhem Ein said the men at the centre were assigned a special mission to
"destroy the internal enemies" of the Khmer Rouge.

He said these "enemies" were normally people who were suspected of being
CIA or KGB spies or Vietnamese agents deployed in Cambodia. There were
also other "secret agents" who were "attempting to act against the Pol
Pot regime".

He said the Khmer Rouge personnel at the Toul Sleng centre were also
assigned to look for officials who had worked for the Prince Sihanouk
regime or the Lon Nol government and to file charges against them.

Nhem Ein said that under the maoist and dictatorial leadership of Pol
Pot, the Khmer Rouge had also created a "formula" to determine who were
intellectuals and to execute them.

"As a result, students and teachers, as well as officials who had worked
for the Prince Sihanouk and Lon Nol governments were arrested and
executed.

He said the Khmer Rouge devised various methods to interrogate prisoners.
"Some victims had their nails removed, others were electrocuted, some
were forced to drink fish brine, or had water poured into their noses,
while yet others were starved," he said.

"In fact, the interrogations were so cruel most of the prisoners ended
up confessing to crimes they did not commit," Nhem Ein said. "They could
not stand the suffering any more."

He said those who were regarded as unimportant persons were also arrested
but they were not interrogated. "Photographs of the victims would be
taken and they would be sent for execution immediately," he said.

Nhem Ein said the victims could be killed in any one of the prisons in
Toul Sleng, Prey Sar, Prek Hou or Choeung Ek.

He said that when youths were arrested, they were sent for execution
without their photographs being taken. However, if they were government
officials or military officers, their pictures were taken and sent as
evidence to the Khmer Rouge leadership.

Nhem Ein said the Khmer Rouge officers worked day and night to torture
and question the victims.

He said that in mid-1978, 30 Thai fishermen and three Europeans were
executed at the Toul Sleng centre.

He said random executions were also carried out against popular singers.
One was a famous singer Chhorn, who was ordered to sing the Democratic
Kampuchea songs together with Mai, a woman artiste.

Nhem Ein believes that another well-known singer Sin Sisamuth, known for
his "golden voice" was executed in either Prey Sar or the Tonle Bati
prison in 1976.

He said the singer had been executed for singing songs from the Sangkum
Reastr Niyum era while working in the padi fields. These songs had been
banned by the Khmer Rouge.

Also purged and killed were the commanders of Divisions 18 to 24, namely
Huo Nim, Vorn Vet, Hock, Chek An, Nat and a general Som. These were the
people who led the resistance movement in the 1970s. A former information
officer close to Huo Nim was also killed.

"Also executed were several commanders accused of being CIA or KGB spies
or Vietnamese agents such as Sok, Ya, Chakry, Nhem Phoem and Sy," Nhem
Ein said.

He said another objective of Pol Pot was to screen all students and
intellectuals and information on them was documented.

"The data and pictures of these students could fill 20 bus-loads," he
said.

"The students were called the "newly-liberated" people or the "17 April"
people. They were regarded as important and were sent to prison in Phnom
Penh.

"Those who were found to be involved in education were executed
immediately because they were thought to be in the way of the regime to
achieve its dream of a nation of agrarians," Nhem Ein added.

Cambodia: Govt appeals for help as floods worsen

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Royal Government of Cambodia has sent out an urgent appeal for
assistance as the floods continue to worsen in several parts of the
kingdom.

This year's floods, the worst in several years, have since taken 16
lives, and up to 1.3 million people are believed to have been affected.

Seven people have been reported missing and at least 500,000 people, who
are in the worst hit areas, require emergency assistance.

The government estimates that it needs more than US$5 million to carry
out relief operations and it is appealing for donations in cash, kind and
services to help the victims.

The deluge has since affected six provinces that lie in the Mekong basin,
namely Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kratie, Kompong Cham, Kandal and Prey
Veng, as well as the outskirts of Phnom Penh.

In addition, at least 232,000 hectares of rice fields have been flooded
and the government reported that about 120,000 hectares have been
destroyed in the floods.

A total of 25 cases of diarrhea and vomiting have also been reported in
one village.

Cambodia: Floods hit 1.3 million people

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Cheang Sopheng

A total of 1.3 million people from six provinces have been affected by
the floods this year, and at least 500,000 of them require emergency aid.

The victims are from the provinces of Ratanakiri, Stung Treng, Kratie,
Kompong Cham, Kandal and Prey Veng, which are located along the Mekong
River.

Also affected are those living on the outskirts of the capital city,
Phnom Penh.

Most of the victims have been evacuated to higher ground or have made
their own way to areas which are still not flooded.

However, the worst may already be over. Reports received from the
affected areas showed that the water level is already receding, albeit
slowly, though the situation is still grave.

Vast areas cultivated with padi have also been badly affected by the
floods. Based on reports received from the affected provinces, the
government estimates that a total of 232,000 hectares of padi fields have
been affected.

Of the total area, an estimated 120,000ha of padi fields, located closest
to the Mekong River, have been destroyed.

Figures that have reached Phnom Penh from the affected provinces show
that in Kompong Cham province, 25,212ha of padi fields have been
destroyed. In Kandal province, farmers lost 9,200ha and in Prey Veng,
another 50,000ha have been destroyed.

Details on the damage caused in the other provinces are expected to be
made available by the government this week.

The governor of Kompong Cham, Hun Neng, said the floods had affected at
least one third of the population who live in 12 of the 16 districts in
the province.

He said 274 dwellings in the province were already under water, and
28,960ha of padi fields have been badly damaged by the floods.

He estimated that about 2,400 tonnes of rice seeds would be needed for
next year's planting season.

Hun Neng said a stretch of 150m on the National Route 6, between Phnom
Penh and Kompong Cham, as well as a bridge, have already been damaged by
the floods.

Stretches along National Route 7 which runs through Kompong Cham town,
have also been severely damaged.

The governor of Prey Veng, Tep Nonary, said five districts in his
province have been seriously affected by the floods and more than
50,000ha of padi fields have been destroyed. Between 80 and 90 per cent
of the remaining four districts are also flooded.

As of last week, he said, 11,399 people have been evacuated and 3,149
dwellings were already under water.

Five areas along National Route 11 have been cut off by the floods. The
first deputy governor of Kratie province, Ven Sokhy, said 24,000ha of
padi fields have already been flooded.

He said 13,000ha of the padi crop have already been destroyed.

The Minister of Public Works and Transport, Ing Kieth, said more than 4km
of road from Phnom Penh to Sway Rieng have been damaged while the roads
from the capital city to Kompong Cham and Kompong Thom had been
destroyed.

Ing Kieth, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said his ministry officials
would inspect the roads and bridges after the floods and in areas where
there is an immediate need, the government would pay for the repairs of
the roads and bridges.

Cambodia: US$5 mil needed for flood relief operations

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Royal Government needs US$5.1 million in cash, kind or services from
international and local donors to meet the immediate needs of 500,000
people who have been hit by the floods.

The emergency assistance is needed to evacuate the flood victims and to
provide them with alternative accommodation, food and clothes.

The Co-Prime Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen had
launched the appeal for aid last month by urging foreign and local
companies, international organisations, non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), the United Nations and friendly countries to chip in with
donations.

Several countries and organisations have, in fact, already sent aid in
cash and in kind.

Deputy Prime Minister Ing Kieth said a meeting would be held this week
with representatives of the foreign embassies and aid agencies to discuss
the supply of aid to the flood victims.

The co-premiers have also been appealing for assistance as they toured
the various provinces affected by the floods.

"I would like to call on the various NGOs, the United Nations,
international organisations as well as local and foreign companies to
help meet the urgent needs of the victims of this disaster," Prince
Ranariddh said during a trip to Kompong Cham.

Hun Sen, who was also in Kompong Cham last week, described the situation
as a "great disaster" and said emergency aid was urgently needed.

The cabinet of Prince Ranariddh also issued a statement requesting
immediate assistance for the victims.

In response, the World Food Programme (WFP), the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), the International Federation of the Red
Cross and Unicef met the National Committee for Disaster Management to
assess the situation and the assistance required.

The representatives said after the meeting that they would submit their
proposals which would be reviewed by the international donors and aid
agencies to come up with an aid plan.

Meanwhile, the government estimated that a total of 8,000 tonnes of rice
seeds would be needed over the next month in the areas most seriously
affected by the floods when planting begins after the floods.

Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Tao Seng Hour said 4,000
tonnes of rice seeds had been prepared and would be supplied to victims
in the six badly affected provinces.

He said the ministry was also preparing to provide more than one million
litres of fuel for water pumps that are used in the padi fields.

He said the ministry would supply 300 tonnes of the rice seeds to Prey
Veng, the most badly affected province, once the floods have receded.

Nhim Vanda, who heads the disaster management panel, said aid agencies
have provided emergency funds and 2,300 tonnes of rice to the victims.

Speaking to flood victims in Prey Veng province last week, Prince
Ranariddh said the government had instructed the Ministry of Commerce to
prepare 1,600 tonnes of rice and other kinds of food for them.

He said local and foreign humanitarian organisations had donated tonnes
of rice through him, Hun Sen and president of the National Assembly
Samdech Chea Sim.

As the flood waters were rising, hundreds of victims also gathered
outside the Royal Palace to seek aid from King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen
Monineath.

In a broadcast on TV, the king expressed his sorrows over the sufferings
of the people and the damage to property and loss of animals caused by
the floods.

Cambodia: When it rains, it pours

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Disasters such as floods tend to affect the poor and needy more than
anyone else.

For 18-year-old Neun Run, forced by his parents to look for a job in
Phnom Penh, it was a period of starvation, fainting spells and the loss
of his hard-earned money.

After four days without food, and several fainting spells, Neun Run had
collapsed along Mao Tsetoung Boulevard last Thursday.

A motodop driver and staff of the Cambodia Times, who found him lying on
the roadside, brought him to the newspaper office where he was given
food, a drink and some medicine.

Neun Run, who is from Memot district, Kompong Cham province, said his
village was badly hit by the floods two weeks ago.

He said that when the water overflowed his village, hundreds of families
moved to the highlands while some found refuge along the highways. His
family lost everything except two sacks of rice which they managed to
carry with them.

A week later, when the food supply was running out, his parents told him
that he had to leave for Phnom Penh to try to get a job.

He said he then decided to leave for the capital city with a neighbour,
22-year-old Chon Ra, who told him that he could get a job washing cars
in Phnom Penh.

"Chon Ra told me we could earn 12,000 riels per month," he said. "He said
he could get a job in Phnom Penh but he needed an advance from my family.
Finally we agreed to give him 12,000 riels."

However, Neun Run said, when they reached Phnom Penh, Chon Ra ran away
with all the money and he was left for four days without food. "I slept
on the roadside and drank water from the potholes. I was living like an
animal," he added.

Neun Run said this was his first trip to the capital city and he does not
have any relatives there.

"I have no alternative now but to go back to my family to help them plant
rice after the floods have receded, but I do not have any money for
travelling," he added.

Meanwhile, in Prey Veng province, victims told the Cambodia Times that
several families were experiencing a shortage of food and medicine.

They said 25 people from the village of Angkor Ang had been hit by
diarrhea and were vomiting after eating stale food and drinking dirty
water. However, they have been treated at a local clinic.

"We will die if there is no emergency supply from the government. We need
food and medicine now," said 48-year-old Chhun Hear. "This is a bad
situation for us."

Cambodia: Willy brings the rain that causes the floods

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The severe floods in Cambodia this year have been caused by heavy rains
over the upper reaches of the Mekong River, brought on by the hurricane
Willy.

In the past two weeks, heavy rains have been recorded in the highlands
in southern China, Laos and north-east Cambodia, areas through which the
Mekong River flows.

Hurricane Willy also caused storms and downpours in Laos and parts of
Cambodia, causing the water in the Mekong River to rise up to an
extraordinarily high level.

The director of the Hydrology Department, Lim Kean Hour, said that in
Laos alone, up to 200ml of rainfall had been recorded during this period,
making the situation worse for Cambodia.

However, he said, the flood is not expected to affect Phnom Penh,
although several areas on the outskirts of the capital city have also
been flooded.

He said the water level of the Mekong River would be lower downstream.
Furthermore, he said, the water level in Tonle Sap lake has still not
reached its maximum and thus could take in more water.

The Tonle Sap lake, located in the north-western part of the kingdom,
acts as a safety valve for nature's drainage system.

The Tonle Sap river flows from the lake and joins the Mekong near Phnom
Penh. However, when there is excess water in the Mekong, the water flows
back into the lake, thus preventing areas downstream from being flooded.

Lim Kean Hour said Phnom Penh would only be flooded if the water level
in the Tonle Bassac river rises above the 11.2m mark.

As of last Friday, the level had reached 10.9m, so excess water could
flow back into the Tonle Sap lake, thus averting floods in the city and
areas downstream of the Mekong River, including southern Vietnam, he
added.

Cambodia: Reprieve illegal workers

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chheang Sopheng

Cambodians will be allowed to work in Thailand under an agreement to be
signed between the governments of the two countries soon.

This move will mean a reprieve for the more than 30,000 Cambodians who
are currently working illegally in the neigbouring kingdom.

The relaxation on the import of foreign labour by the Thai government
will also cover those from Myanmar and Laos - the other two countries
which share common borders with Thailand.

The new regulation will also cover those workers from Cambodia, Laos and
Myanmar who are at present illegally employed in Thailand.

Prasitt Caitong Pan, the director-general of the Thai Department of
Employment in the Ministry of Social Welfare explained that the
government had decided to allow the illegal workers from these countries
to work legally in Thailand because of the geographical proximity between
them and their cultural and traditional similarities.

Besides, the governments of the four countries have a history of
cooperation and good relations, he added.

The Thai government and its Ministry of Social Welfare and Labour have
come up with regulations on how to deal with the illegal workers from the
three countries.

An agreement is expected to be signed between the Cambodian authorities
and their Thai counterparts pertaining to the Cambodians who are now
working illegally in Thailand.

To expedite matters, the Royal Government of Cambodia will be setting up
an inter-ministerial committee to study the problem of the Cambodian
workers who are living and working illegally in Thailand.

Suy Sem, the Secretary of State for the Cambodian Ministry of Social
Welfare, Labour and Veterans said that it has been decided that once the
committee's study is completed, the agreement will be signed between the
Thai and Cambodian authorities to legalise the status of all the illegal
workers from each country working in the other.

The regulations will allow Cambodian workers to stay in Thailand for a
two-year period. Thai workers will also be allowed to be employed in
Cambodia for a similar length of time.

After the two years is up, the workers will be sent back to their own
countries.

However, those who wish to stay on in Thailand will have to go through
the correct procedures for obtaining a permit to remain legally in
Thailand.

Prasitt explained that in the case of Cambodian workers who want to
remain in Thailand after the two-year period is up, both governments are
in the process of drawing up further regulations so that these workers
can continue working in Thailand in accordance with Thai law.

These conditions will require all the Cambodian workers in Thailand to
register with the Ministry of Social Welfare within a 90-day period from
Sept 1, 1996.

The Thai authorities will issue "living permission cards" and working
cards to these individuals. The workers will also be required to pay 500
bahts to the Thai Ministry of Social Welfare, 1,000 bahts a year for the
working permission card and another 1,000 bahts as "guarantee fee" which
is refundable after the two years is up.

Prasitt added that most of the illegal immigrants in Thailand were from
Myanmar, numbering about 400,000. There are 10,000 from Laos and about
200,000 from India, China and Sri Lanka.

On the other hand, there are about 1,000 Thai workers in Cambodia, of
which only 189 have registered with Cambodia's Department of Labour.

Suy Sem said however that all foreign workers who come to Cambodia have
to register with the kingdom's Ministry of Social Welfare. This, of
course, includes the illegal Thai workers in Cambodia.

Suy Sem explained that there are many legal and illegal workers in the
kingdom, most seeking employment with foreign companies, while there are
others who only stay for short periods while waiting for jobs in third
countries.

The Thai government has said that over 30,000 Cambodian workers have
entered Thailand without the necessary travel documents and are thus
illegally employed.

Of the total number of illegal workers, about 3,000 are in the
construction sector, while 2,000 are involved in the agricultural sector.

According to the Thai authorities, most of the illegal workers are
employed in the ports or as construction workers, especially in Bangkok
and Pra Chun Bory province.

Jobs are more easily available in these areas and the workers can earn
at least 160 bahts a day.

Thai government officials claim that the actual number of illegal
Cambodian workers could very well be far more than the statistics show.
The problem of the illegal workers was discussed last month by Suy Sem
and Prasitt.

According to Prasitt, Thai law now provides for the immediate deportation
of illegal workers, whether or not the Cambodian government is aware of
the situation.

Suy Sem, meanwhile, said he will brief the Royal Government on the
matter.

He added that he personally cannot accept that there are over 30,000
illegal Cambodian immigrants living in Thailand.

He explained that in any event, his ministry alone cannot deal with the
issue and needs the inter-ministerial committee to decide whether or not
the so-called Cambodian illegal workers are indeed Khmer.

Cambodia: US may help rebuild highway

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The United States has expressed interest in helping rebuild a national
highway to Pailin, an important trading town that until about a month ago
was a stronghold of Khmer Rouge guerrillas and off-limits to most
Cambodians.

"The US ambassador told Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen that his
government would like to help repair the road to develop the area," said
Om Yu Tiang, an adviser to the co-premier.

The 85km stretch links Pailin and the north-western provincial capital
of Battambang. Pailin is under the control of the Khmer Rouge dissidents
who broke away from hard-liners loyal to Pol Pot in August and are
negotiating peace with the government.

Cambodia: Abortions a major cause of death

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ros Sokhet

Complications arising from abortions, both legal and illegal, have become
one of the major causes of death among Cambodian women.

While statistics from the Ministry of Health show that about 2,000 women
die every year from abortion related problems, studies by the Family
Planning International Assistance (FPIA) claim that the number is more
like 200,000.

According to the FPIA study, a large number of abortions are conducted
under deplorable conditions and underscores the desperate circumstances
pregnant women are faced with such as the lack of efficient and reliable
family planning services.

Abortion, being illegal in Cambodia (with a few exceptions), has created
legal obstacles for women who want to terminate pregnancies. Thus, in
desperation, women are forced to resort to the services of the untrained
and unskilled, often with fatal results, the FPIA study said.

Kien Sereyphal of the Cambodian Women's Development Association (CWDA),
explained the local problem.

"The abortions are often performed by trained birth attendants, in
ill-equipped homes. When complications arise, these attendants do not
have sufficient expertise or training to salvage the situation and save
the mother," she said.

The solution to the problem, according to the study, lies in family
planning.

"No law, no religion has proven to be effective when it comes to
decreasing the number of abortions. Only increased access to reliable
family planning services, combined with high quality information can do
this," the FPIA revealed.

Successful planning programmes take time to be formulated and then
implemented and could not emerge within a matter of months. Accordingly,
for the programme to be truly effective, the attitude of parents towards
children - the number they intend to have and the age gap between each
child - and the opportunities they may have later in life, must all be
examined. "This all begins at birth," the study pointed out.

The FPIA study also revealed that the problem is not restricted to
Cambodia.

An estimated 25 million abortions are performed each year in developing
countries, most under unsafe conditions.

Among married women, who do not want to get pregnant, at least 100
million face an unmet need for contraception. Most of these women live
in the third world.

Every year, about 500,000 women die from pregnancy related causes.

"This means that every minute of the day a women dies as a result of her
pregnancy or in childbirth," Paul Hamilton, a country representative of
the FPIA, said.

Cambodia: King donates bicycles

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath donated bicycles, clothes and
study materials to 260 students from poor families around Phnom Penh last
week.

Other students, who were not given bicycles, received cash amounting to
100,000 riels each from the king and queen.

King Sihanouk advised the students to study hard in the new school year,
not just for their own good, but also for the future good of the nation.

The bicycles were donated by the Japanese government.

Cambodia: 'leng Sary had no power'

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, once believed to be the second and third
most powerful men in the Khmer Rouge, were, in fact, powerless.

Every ministry and institution of the Democratic Kampuchea government was
under the control of Pol Pot, the shadowy leader of the Khmer Rouge, said
Nhem Ein, the former information officer of the Maoist group.

The only other people allowed to make decisions and implement them were
Noun Chea, who was the president of the National Assembly, and Son Sen,
the deputy prime minister and defence minister.

Nhem Ein said Ieng Sary, who was the foreign minister, had no authority
to decide on anything. He described the activities in the ministry at
that time as "sluggish".

He said Khieu Samphan, who was the head of state, was also a powerless
man.

"Many Cambodians liked him (Khieu Samphan) but they did not like Pol
Pot's way of ruling the country," he said.

"However, he had no power so he had to follow Pol Pot," Nhem Ein added.

Cambodia: No more lessons on genocide

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Ros Sokhet

The break-up of the Khmer Rouge promises to change the political scenario
in Cambodia. The break-up of the Khmer Rouge has also changed what
children learn in school.

For a start, there will no longer be any references to the genocidal
regime of the Maoist group.

All illustrations and text of Khmer Rouge atrocities have been removed
from the textbooks for pupils in the first, sixth and seventh grades.

In addition, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports has instructed
teachers to discontinue lessons on the subject in all other grades even
though such references have yet to be expunged from the textbooks.

In place of this subject, pupils will be given instructions on the
environment, human rights and moral instructions.

Stories of the genocide carried out by the Khmer Rouge regime, led by Pol
Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan, were contained in the textbooks
published by the State of Cambodia government, which ousted the maoist
regime in 1979.

These textbooks contained criticisms of the Khmer Rouge's reign of terror
and pupils studied the atrocities committed by the Pol Potists. In the
textbooks, Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Khieu Samphan were also portrayed as
traitors of the country.

The vice-director of the research institute of the education ministry,
Ly Somony, said one of the subjects, Social Studies, carried lessons on
the Khmer Rouge's atrocities. It explained how the Khmer Rouge tortured
and starved Cambodians during their rule of the country from 1975 to
1979.

Under the Cambodian education system, there are six grades - 1 to 6 - in
the primary school level. At the secondary school level are Grades 7 to
9 and the high school level are Grades 10 to 12.

Ly Somony said textbooks to be given to pupils in Grades 1, 6 and 7 will
no longer contain anything on the Khmer Rouge. The new school year
started last month, but the pupils are only expected to get their books
this month.

"The word `genocide' will no longer be seen in the newly published
textbooks," he said.

However, the move to remove all references to the Khmer Rouge in school
textbooks has also drawn some criticisms.

Ly Somony said he had been approached by several intellectuals who held
the view that subjects on the genocide should remain in the school
syllabus.

He said the intellectuals, some of whom were also from the ministry, had
reminded him that many Cambodians were killed and the country was ruined
during Pol Pot's reign and that "we should not forget the horrible
regime".

He said his institute had conveyed the message to the minister but there
has yet to be any response. "We are only the writers of the books, and
we always abide by the government's policy," he said.

The minister, Tol Lah, could not be reached for comment as he is out of
the country, but a ministry official said the government was not likely
to go back on its decision to discontinue lessons on the Khmer Rouge.

"The Royal Government is carrying out a policy of national reconciliation
and thus would like to see that such subjects on Khmer Rouge atrocities
be removed from the education syllabus," the official said.

Meanwhile, the deputy director of the ministry's publishing house, Koeu
Nay Leang, said the new books for the three grades would be printed by
the third week of this month.

He said a total of 1.28 million books in eight subjects would be printed
for pupils in the first grade. In addition, there are 410,000 books in
five subjects for pupils of Grade 6 and 210,000 books in 12 subjects for
those in Grade 7.

All books are given free of charge to the pupils.

Ly Somony said that next year, the ministry would publish new books for
pupils in the second and eighth grades while those in the fourth and 10th
grades would get new books in 1999.

In the year 2000, new books will be published for pupils in Grades 5 and
11 and in 2001, a new edition of the books will be published for pupils
in Grade 6 while pupils in Grade 12 will also be given new books without
the subject on the Khmer Rouge.

Cambodia: Charting the nation's course

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Mehran Chinniah

It is not easy locating the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace
(CICP).

Squeezed between the rows of pre-fabricated cabins at the Government
Palace at Wat Phnom, the office is a legacy of the United Nations
Transitional Authority in Cambodia - a memorial to the Third World.

You have to manoeuvre past numerous potholes and puddles of water before
arriving at the CICP workplace where the wooden pathway creaks with each
step.

Founded in June 1994, the CICP's objectives are to help the government
in its public policy and nurture regional and international cooperation.

The institute thrives on cutting corners: it operates with a skeletal
staff of four. Materials that need to be photocopied have first to be
verified and personal phone calls are limited to two three-minute
conversations per day.

"If you have to talk to your girlfriend or boyfriend, don't do it on
company time," reads a terse memo on the wall.

The CICP's frugality is as a good a metaphor as any for CICP's place in
Cambodia's lengthy list of non-governmental organisations. It is a small
think tank that has grown in a manner more spectacular than most would
have imagined.CICP executive director Kao Kim Hourn has a decidedly
simple explanation for all this.

Sitting at his cluttered desk, dressed in his trademark white,
short-sleeved shirt and tie, he says: "We are small because small
sometimes means beautiful. We are small so we can work effectively and
move faster."

It is no mere puff. In the short two years since CICP was established,
it has organised five major conferences and seminars in Cambodia,
produced more than 10 papers and journals and has presented more than 20
working papers in conferences throughout the region.

In Kao's words, the research papers, seminars and conferences "will help
us to re-think what we have been thinking". "That's what we have been
doing. Whether it is conferences, seminars, workshops or lectures, we
provide a forum for consultation and dialogue for policy makers and
academics on one hand, and students and the younger generation, on the
other, to bridge the gap," he said.

The research, Kao said, is not for research's sake. "The research we do
is to give some new ideas and perspectives to our public policy. It is
the future that we are worried about."Its recent publication - the
Cambodian Journal of International Affairs - is the first publication of
its kind by any non-governmental organisation in the kingdom.

But the feather in its cap is, by far, CICP's appointment as the seventh
member of Asean-ISIS (Institute of Strategic and International Studies),
a prestigious group of policy-oriented think tanks.

The other six are ISIS Malaysia, ISIS Thailand, the Singapore Institute
of International Affairs, the Institute of Strategic and Developmental
Studies Indonesia and Institute of International Relations Vietnam.

The CICP will be Cambodia's official representative in the South-East
Asian economic grouping in March next year.

It is, fellow NGOs concur, a fitting testimony to CICP's efforts in
Cambodia's foreign policy in the international arena.

Says Kao: "It means that we are part of an important regional process.
We will be able to assist the government better in terms of ideas and
vision."

Clearly, the future lies with Asean, as far as the CICP is concerned. The
world is working towards regionalism and Cambodia has to be part of the
group to develop quickly, Kao said.

Although Cambodia will become a full member of the regional grouping in
July 1997, the CICP's work is far from finished.

"CICP's work is now at the next level. We have to reach out to more
people in our meetings, seminars and conferences. We have to look beyond
Asean, to our relations with the United Nations, with the European Union,
Apec and WTO.

"The role of forward looking diplomacy is vital if Cambodia wants to
protect its interests. We cannot be left out. We have to be part of a
region that is changing and developing quickly," Kao said.

Cambodia: CICP mission statement

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

The Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, founded in 1994, is
a non-profit, non-partisan, and non-governmental policy-oriented
institute.

It is dedicated to cultivating greater understanding of national,
regional and international issues that are of concern to
Cambodia.Cambodia is re-entering the world community at a time of
unprecedented opportunity and complexity.

The institute believes that internal and external stability are necessary
for the future peace and prosperity of Cambodia. Thus, there is an acute
need to comprehend domestic issues in isolation as well as in relation
to regional and international conditions.

To fill this need, CICP fosters both a domestic and a South-East Asian
constructive dialogue among government officials, international
organisations, scholars and the private sector on issues of security,
foreign policy, conflict resolution, economics and national development.

Cambodia: Destruction of mines on record

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

A British photographer Tim Page, has started documenting the destruction
of Cambodia's mine fields to help highlight the situation at the
international conference on mines.

Four of Page's images will be carried on the Internet home page of the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

This will coincide with the up-coming Canadian government-sponsored mine
conference.

The Ottawa conference Towards a Global Ban on Anti-Personnel Landmines
will gather representatives from the 43 countries that have supported a
global ban on the production, stockpiling, transfer and use of
anti-personnel landmines.

"This is the first time the Red Cross has gone public on an issue, a
spokesman of the ICRC, Gordon Bates said.

He added that the impetus came from ICRC medical teams weary of
contending with the grisly damage done by mines.

"It was a mutiny from our own surgeons who told us that we could not go
forward unless we took some kind of ethical stance," Bates said.

For Page, who was a war-time photographer injured by a mine in Vietnam
in 1969, the campaign has a personal significance.

"When I come back here, I am terrified," he told the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Cambodia.

"To take pictures of people with their limbs blown away, everyday it gets
more difficult," Page added.

Cambodia had drafted a law banning the use and purchase of anti-personnel
landmines, but the legislation is not expected to be passed soon.

There are an estimated four to six million landmines in Cambodia, making
it one of the most heavily mined countries in the world.

Cambodia in nuke ban treaty

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Cambodia became a signatory to the comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT)
in New York on Sept 26 1996, when Minister of Foreign Affairs and
International Relations Ung Huot signed on behalf of the kingdom.

Cambodia's position on the question of nuclear weapons has always been
that complete prohibition of nuclear weapons and the destruction of
existing ones is crucial to world peace, a press release from Cambodia's
permanent mission to the United Nations said.

Cambodia was one of the sponsors of the resolution that was presented by
Australia on Sept 10 to the United Nations.

Cambodia: It's only natural

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Leak Ratna

There are no additives or chemicals. It is cheap and it is easily
available. It is the Cambodian roll-up, a non-filtered, 100 per cent
tobacco cigarette and it can be found just about anywhere in the capital
city of Phnom Penh, wherever a roadside vendor seats herself.

Last week, Lifetimes went looking for these cigarettes and found that
most of the vendors are women.

These women deal with the tobacco suppliers, they buy the paper, they
prepare the flour-based paste to stick the cigarette paper together, they
spread the tobacco on the paper and roll them up into foot-long
cigarettes and then cut them into pieces of four or five, and then they
sell them.

These women always look very busy. Several of them can be seen sitting
at their makeshift stalls under the trees on the corner of Samdech
Monireth Boulevard and Jawaharlal Nehru Boulevard, near the Olympic
Stadium, and they will be rolling the cigarettes.

One of these vendors is 53-year-old Sok Ouy who has been selling the
roll-ups for six years already. Everyday, for 15 hours a day, from 6am
to 9pm, she sits under the tree selling the hand-rolled cigarettes.

Her fingers may seem gnarled, but they are nimble. She call roll 500
cigarettes in an hour. At 100 riels for five cigarettes, that means
50,000 riels worth of cigarettes.

Sok Ouy sells anything between 500 and 2,000 cigarettes per day. After
deducting her costs, she makes between 3,000 and 15,000 riels. In a week,
she can sell about 50kg worth of tobacco.

Contrary to popular belief, smokers of the Cambodian roll-ups come from
all walks of life.

"It is not true that only the poor people smoke these cigarettes. I also
have some very wealthy customers," Sok Ouy said.

"They say the cigarette has a distinctive flavour, is strong and smooth.
They can get full satisfaction with just a few puffs," she added.

Although she has never had someone instruct her on rolling cigarettes,
with regular practice over the years, Sok Ouy has made it into an art
form.

"I watched and I learnt. The old hands were always there doing it and
after having seen it done a few times, I did it too," she said
matter-of-fact.

Despite the fact that she only has a makeshift stall at the roadside, Sok
Ouy also has to worry about overheads.

To keep her spot on the roadside, she has to pay a daily "rental" of
1,000 riels to the owner of the house in front of which her stall is
located. She also has to pay 100 per day to the contractor who keeps the
streets clean and a weekly tax of 500 riels to the local authorities.

The tobacco is delivered to Sok Ouy by the supplier. She buys in bulk -
500kg of tobacco at a time, at 6,000 riels per kilogramme.

The paper can be bought from the markets, already cut into the correct
size, at 5,000 riels per 10,000 pieces of paper.

The cooked flour costs 600 riels per 500g. The flour is boiled until it
becomes thick like a porridge. This gluey concoction is then used to
stick the cigarette paper together. The "rolling instrument" cost about
15,000 riels.

Selling cigarettes has proven to be more lucrative for Sok Ouy. Before
she embarked on this venture, she used to sell banana fritters.

"It was too difficult selling banana fritters. I had to do everything by
myself," she complained.

However, its does not seem very much easier selling the roll-up
cigarettes. During the 15 hours at work, Sok Ouy is bent over rolling
cigarettes.

In addition, she has to see that her tobacco supplier is paid every week.
The amount of money she pays the supplier, of course, depends on the
amount she earns each week. She only takes delivery of her next
consignment of 500kg of tobacco when she pays in full.

These days, however, life is a little easier for Sok Ouy. She now has two
assistants to help her roll up the cigarettes.

"I have found that I cannot do this for long anymore. Bending up and down
while rolling the cigarettes has given me a backache and a pain in the
wrist," she said.

She pays her two workers a salary of 30,000 riels per month. In addition,
they are provided meals. The work in Sok Ouy's house, located not far
away from her stall. Her husband also helps.

"I need to work hard for the sake of my family. I have four children -
three boys and a girl. My eldest, aged 26, is a policeman but his salary
is very low. My other children are not working," she said.

Her youngest child is already 18 years old. Her three younger children
are still living with her.

Another one of these women entrepreneurs is Phim Sokoun, 46, who comes
from Kompong Cham province.

Phim Sokoun is still new to the trade as she took over the business from
her daughter who retired after her marriage six months ago.

She buys about 50kg of tobacco a time. Everyday she rolls cigarettes from
7am to 2.30pm. Phim Sokoun, still relatively inexperienced, can roll only
about 100 cigarettes per day.

She is further hampered by the fact that her cigarette roller has the
capacity for only one cigarette at a time. She earns between 2,000 and
10,000 riels a day.

"The best type of tobacco comes from Kompong Cham province," she said.

Phim Sokoun lives with her daughter in Steng Meanchey district, Phnom
Penh. She has nine children, five of whom live in Phnom Penh while the
other four live in Kompong Cham with her husband. The oldest is 28 and
the youngest is 10.

Phim Sokoun seems to accept her lot in life. "I do not have the kind of
money to venture into the world of big business. That is why I chose to
be in this business. It is more profitable than selling sweets in Kompong
Cham," she said, smiling.

Cambodia: No let-up on illegal logging: Govt officials and military
personnel also involved, says minister

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Reaksmey Kongkea

In addition to waging a guerrilla war against the Royal Government in the
past three years, the Khmer Rouge was also causing a major environmental
problem - the depletion of the kingdom's forest cover.

However, the mass defection and rebellion of the guerrilla fighters
against the Maoist group's hard-line leadership has not eased the
pressure on Cambodia's natural heritage.

Areas formerly under Khmer Rouge control are still losing their forests
through illegal logging and the culprits now are local government
officials and military personnel, according to officials in the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

These provincial officials and military officers are, in fact, conspiring
with foreign traders and loggers to exploit the Cambodian forests for
profits, the minister Tao Seng Hour told the Cambodia Times.

These illegal activities are rampant in the north-western provinces of
Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom and Koh Kong and as a result, vast areas of
forests have been destroyed, the deputy director of the Provincial
Forestry and Fisheries Department, Kim Samol said.

He said the illegal loggers, who used to work with the Khmer Rouge,
continued to fell trees and transporting the logs across the borders to
Thailand and Laos.

These areas, he said, were formerly under the Khmer Rouge, but came under
the Royal Government's control near the end of last year.

Kim Samol said that in some cases, soldiers of the Royal Cambodian Armed
Forces (RCAF) were cutting down the trees and transporting the logs to
foreign timber traders.

"Thousands of dollars are collected each day from the sale of the logs
and the money goes into the pockets of corrupt government officials, he
said.

A foreign forestry expert in the ministry alleged that the illegal
loggers were, in fact, RCAF soldiers who were conspiring with provincial
officials to cut down new trees and transporting the logs across the
border.

"Their actions are illegal and causing the destruction of the forests.
It is also against the decision of the government not to export anymore
new logs," the expert, who declined to be named, added.

(Earlier this year, the government had stated that it would not allow
anymore exports of logs once the existing stock of one million cubic
metres have been sold. Eight Thai companies have been given permits to
export the logs, which had been cut earlier but not exported yet.)

He said the areas which had been badly affected by the illegal logging
activities were forests in Kompong Thom and Koh Kong.

Sources in Preah Vihear province have alleged that each night, the logs
would be transported in four or five trucks to the border where they were
loaded into waiting boats to be sent to Thailand.

The sources added that hundreds of hectares of forests have been
destroyed as a result of the illegal logging operations.

A report from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries shows
that about 30 logging concessions, covering a total area of 6.4 million
hectares, have been given out by the government.

The foreign forestry expert estimated that this was roughly equivalent
to the kingdom's remaining forest cover.

All sides in the Cambodian civil conflict have, in the past, sold timber
to help fund their military operations.

The Khmer Rouge reportedly earned millions of dollars every month, part
of which they used to buy arms, from selling logging and gems mining
concessions in areas under their control to Thai companies.

However, the forestry expert blamed the Khmer Rouge for most of the
country's deforestation, especially around Pailin where their
headquarters is located.

"The Khmer Rouge are the main factors in the destruction of the forests
around Pailin. They also cooperate with foreigners to exploit gemstones
and these activities cause environmental deterioration," he said.

However, the expert admitted that the ill-disciplined elements in the
government forces were also responsible for the illegal logging
operations. He alleged that sometimes they also deal with the Khmer
Rouge.

Tao Seng Hour said the Thai and Cambodian governments had agreed to
cooperate in efforts to stamp out the illegal export of timber to
Thailand.

He said his ministry was taking action to stop the illegal logging
operations by local officials and military personnel. He said action
would also be taken to stop the export of logs and sawn timber from Preah
Vihear, Kompong Thom and Koh Kong provinces.

However, he did not outline the measures that the ministry was taking.

"If we find proof that local officials are involved in these illegal
activities and conspiring with foreign traders, we have to fine them and
put them in jail," Tao Seng Hour added.

Funcinpec wants Sirivudh to return to Cambodia

from THE CAMBODIA TIMES, October 07 - 13, 1996

Chheang Sopheng

The announcement by the co-premiers that the former Khmer Rouge number
two man Ieng Sary will be pardoned has renewed calls for the return of
Prince Norodom Sirivudh.

The steering committee of the Funcinpec party has urged its president,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, to invite his half-uncle to return to Cambodia.

Prince Sirivudh, a former secretary-general of the party, was exiled to
France after being accused of involvement in a plot to assassinate Second
Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen in December last year.

The Phnom Penh Municipal Court tried Prince Sirivudh, a half-brother of
King Norodom Sihanouk, in absentia. He was found guilty and sentenced to
10 years in prison.

At a two-day meeting of the party's national council, the Funcinpec
steering committee urged Prince Ranariddh, who is the First Prime
Minister, to write a letter to Prince Sirivudh to invite him back to the
kingdom.

Committee member Lu Lay Sreng also proposed that the exiled prince be
allowed to rejoin the party's steering committee.

He also expressed hope that King Sihanouk would grant an amnesty to the
prince considering that Ieng Sary, who had been found guilty and
sentenced to death on charges of killing people during the four-year
genocidal regime, would also be pardoned.

"Compared to Ieng Sary, Prince Sirivudh's case is less serious. If we
want national reconciliation, the prince should be granted amnesty," Lu
Lay Sreng said.

He said that although the National Assembly had stripped Prince Sirivudh
of his immunity, he was officially still a member of the house and
remained a very important person to the Funcinpec.

He said that in a letter to the prince recently, the party had urged him
to write to the king to ask for amnesty.

Prince Ranariddh said it was now up to the prince to request for a pardon
from the king.

"If there is a request from Prince Sirivudh in his own handwriting, I
believe the king will pardon him. The Funcinpec will support him," he
told reporters at the Funcinpec headquarters in Phnom Penh after the
meeting last week.

To questions from newsmen, he said the decision to pardon Ieng Sary would
ensure that his half-uncle would also be granted amnesty.

"Whether Hun Sen agrees or not, it is up to him, but I will support
Prince Sirivudh and it is my understanding that King Sihanouk will also
agree to the pardon," he added.

"A pardon for Prince Sirivudh will be justice for him and for the
Funcinpec party. If Ieng Sary can be pardoned, why not Prince Sirivudh,
who has not even killed anyone?" Prince Ranariddh asked.

He said the prince could resume his duties as member of parliament and
rejoin the Funcinpec steering committee, but he would not be reappointed
party secretary-general.

"We have already appointed Loy Sim Chheang to the post," he added.

At the meeting, the members also unanimously approved the appointment of
an additional 13 members to the steering committee, bringing the total
membership now to 33. The move is to strengthen the party for the next
general elections in 1998.

The new members are Princess Marie Ranariddh, Hong Sun Huoth, Tao Seng
Hour, Chum Chheang, Man Bunthon, Chea Rithy Chhuth, Keang Vang, Ho Sok,
Ek Serywath, Kheat Vandy, Khan Saveourn, Ly Seng Hong and Sum Nipha.

First deputy secretary-general Chhim Seak Leng said the party needed more
active officials to carry out its activities and to prepare for the
elections.

He said the decision to enlarge the steering committee was made to
overcome the problem of the lack of quorum when meetings had to be held
to discuss important internal issues.

The party also adopted several resolutions. They are:

- to adopt a political platform outlining the principles and guidelines
in the implementation of political, economic, social and cultural
programmes;

- to nominate Prince Ranariddh to continue his "noble mission" as premier
of the government for a second term after the general elections of 1998;

- to determine that the general elections will take place in 1998 as
stipulated in the constitution;

- to appeal to all international organisations, in particular the United
Nation, and all friendly countries to send personnel to observe the
preparation and conduct of the elections, the counting of ballots and to
provide the necessary technical assistance, and

- to appeal to all Cambodian political parties to appoint and make known
to the public their candidate for the post of premier.
