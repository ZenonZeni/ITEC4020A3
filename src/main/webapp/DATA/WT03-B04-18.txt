JANUARY 1996

IRAN
POLITICS

Attention is now concentrated on the parliamentary (Majlis) elections
set for March 8, 1996.  This has already led to some concerted
criticism of the power of the clergy in politics and, in early
October, to student demonstrations in Tehran university.  Details of
the incident, or incidents, are patchy, but it appears that students
sympathetic to the Hezbollahi staged some sort of demonstration in a
lecture hall, which then got out of hand.

In any event, this election will be a critical one for President
Rafsanjani and his reformist government.  Parliamentary elections in
Iran are complicated by the fact that the country has had no
nationally organized political parties since 1987.  This gives rise
to a large number of candidates standing as independents - typically
some 1,500 candidates compete for the 270 parliamentary seats.  With
Islam being the most pervasive national organization, this system
tends to favor religious candidates with strong local support.

Without the discipline of party ideology or membership, such
candidates are likely to be far more responsive to clerical or
popular opinion than they are to the government.  As a result, the
government's parliamentary support can become extremely fragile.

And that is the problem now.  With the massive contraction in
economic growth and high inflation, Rafsanjani's popularity is on a
long downward track.  This was shown in the last presidential
election in 1993, when support for Rafsanjani fell sharply.  However,
Rafsanjani's government was still fairly safe as its supporters
formed the largest bloc in the Majlis after the April 1992
parliamentary election with around 110 seats.  With the remaining
seats split between the antipathetic religious and, for want of a
better description, left-of-center candidates, the government has
been able to get support for its legislation  by playing one group
off against the other.

This time around there appears to be a real risk that religious
candidates will make significant advances at the expense of those
candidates supporting the government.  This, perhaps, is the real
reason behind the recent attacks on "politicized" clerics and
President Rafsanjani's call in a radio and television interview in
November for the formation of political parties rather than the
current "interest" groups that contest elections.

Rafsanjani argued that "serious" nationally based political parties
are essential in a political system that employs an electoral system
and that if any single party obtained a majority in parliament it
should form the government.  The statement was generally welcomed,
though many have also pointed out that this is not the first time a
call for the formation of political parties has been made since the
Islamic Republic Party stopped functioning in 1987.

To the surprise of many, the death sentence imposed on Fazel Khodadad
for his part in the Ir1,230 billion embezzlement at Bank Saderat was
carried out on November 22.  In all 20 people were arrested on the
embezzlement charges in the summer, but it was thought that Khodadad
was too highly placed to suffer the punishment meted out by the
court.  Two others were sentenced to life imprisonment and six to
long-term jail terms and cash fines.

Tehran Oil Conference
The successful holding of the international oil and gas conference in
November was hailed by the government as the decisive indicator of
the failure of the US oil trade embargo. The aim of the conference
was to brief foreign companies interested in taking part in the 11
projects being opened to foreign investment in the current five year
plan period.

Representatives from 123 international oil companies and 20 Iranian
companies attended the conference.  The size of the foreign
attendance has been taken by the government as the strongest possible
indicator that non-US oil companies will tender for the projects on a
buy-back basis and that its planned development of its oil and gas
sector will not be pushed off track by the US embargo.

Of the 11 projects, five are offshore.  They comprise the development
of the South Pars gas field, a the injection of gas into the Dorud
oil field, the development of the Khaf gas reservoir in the Salman
field, the development of the new Belal oil field, and the
reconstruction of installations and enhancement of the Sorush oil
field.

The on shore projects comprise a gas condensate refinery in Bandar
Abbas, a project for the Shiraz refinery, the construction of a gas
condensate recovery system at Lavan island, the construction of gas
and liquefied natural gas plants in southern Iran, and a project for
the collection of oil field gases in the south.

Foreign Relations
Pakistan
Although an official visit to Tehran by Prime Minister Bhutto has
served to put a stamp on the increasingly close relations between
Pakistan and Iran, a potential source of discord is beginning to
appear.  It seems that the two countries are supporting opposing
sides in the conflict in Afghanistan.  Relations between Pakistan and
the government of Afghanistan are already under pressure following
Afghani government allegations that Prime Minister Bhutto's
government is supporting the Taleban forces ranged against it.  This
has been denied by Pakistan and was denied again by Prime Minister
Bhutto during her visit to Iran.

However, Iran has consistently supported the government of President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.  Moreover, shortly before Prime Minister
Bhutto's visit, the Taleban forces officially complained that Iran
was training Afghan government troops in Iran.  Iran has also been
accused of allowing Afghan government forces to operate from Iranian
territory to launch operations aimed at liberating the town of Herat.
This has been denied by Iran, but the fact that the sympathies of the
two new partners clearly lie with opposing factions could prove to be
a problem in the future.

Iraq
Iranian involvement in Iraqi Kurdistan is growing, to anger of the
Iraqi government and exasperation of the USA.  After the failure of
the peace conference between the two main Iraqi Kurdish factions -
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP) -  in Dublin, Iran hosted another meeting between the two in
Tehran in October, and achieved at least a partial agreement.

To make matters worse, reports surfaced in November that Iran had
armed and dispatched units of Iraqi Shi'is to the Kurdish-inhabited
areas of Iraq in order to launch attacks against the Baghdad
government with the backing of the Iraqi National Congress. The units
are reportedly from the Imam Ali Regiment, Badr Brigade, and have
been deployed around Sulaymaniyah. (For further details see the Iraq
report in this issue.)

United Arab Emirates
Four day long talks between expert teams from Iran and the UAE in
Doha, UAE, over competing territorial claims ended in failure in
November.  The dispute between the two countries centers around the
Gulf islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunb islands
(Tunb al-Kubra and Tunb al-Sughra).

The islands are claimed by Iran, particularly Abu Musa, which was
occupied by Britain when it was the colonial power in the region.
However, when Britain left the island in 1971 it did not hand it over
to Iran but to the UAE.  The meeting apparently broke down when the
two sides failed even to agree on its agenda - Iran wanted to discuss
the administration of Abu Musa, while the UAE wanted to press its
sovereignty claim.

Iran has invited the UAE to hold to next round of talks in Tehran.
Currently, the UAE is resisting this and no announcement has been
made as to when the next round of talks will be held.

Turkmenistan
Iran and Tukmenistan have agreed on a series of military cooperation
measures, including joint exercises, following the first visit to
Turkmenistan by an Iranian military delegation in November.
Agreement has also been reached on Iranian and Turkmen border guards
working together to prevent violations of the common border

Japan
Iran is concerned over US pressure on Japan not to make payment of
the second installment of a loan agreed in April 1991.  Under the
terms of the deal, Japan undertook to contribute N150 trillion in
loans for construction f the Karun-4 dam in Iran's southern province
of Khuzestan.  In May 1993, Japan made a first installment of N38.6
billion (US$400 million) on the project.  However, it has not yet
paid the remainder.

Pressure is now on Iran as it needs the remainder of the loan to be
paid now if it is to complete the project by the target date of 2000.
Iran believes that the USA is putting strong pressure on Japan not to
pay the second installment and to cut back its trade with Iran.

IRAN
FINANCE

President Rafsanjani presented the budget for the year March 21,
1996-March 20, 1997 on November 26.  This second annual budget in the
second five-year development plan (1995-1999) totals Ir138,133.4
billion, an increase of 43.8% on the 1995/96 budget.  However, with
inflation running at over 50%, the budget represents a cut back in
spending in real terms.

The government's general budget was put at Ir60,742.3 billion, a
30.9% increase on 1995/96.

The budget for state-owned companies, profit-making institutes
affiliated to the government and banks is forecast at Ir90,248.4
billion, up 41% on 1995/96.  Of this figure, Ir79,928.4 billion
belonged to state-owned companies, Ir1,935.7 billion to profit-making
institutions affiliated to the government, and Ir8,384.3 billion to
banks.

Total revenues are put at Ir54,369.3 billion, an increase of 28.5%.
Some 51.5% of the total comes from oil income, 19.6% from tax income,
and 28.9% from other revenue sources.

Of the total revenue for the government, 25.5% will come from taxes
on oil and gas, electricity, posts and telecommunications services,
29.2% from hard currency sales, 34% from income-expenditure items and
11.3% from other items.

The increase in tax incomes is mainly due to a rise in taxes levied
on non-governmental companies, on jobs and on imports, which will
accrue through the improvement in the country's economy and the
expansion of trade and manufacturing in the domestic economy.

Crude oil production capacity is targeted to reach 4,250,000 b/d, and
gas production by 110 million cu.m/day.  The capacity of Bandar Abbas
refinery is to be raised to 232,000 b/d.  The oil price has been set
at US$15.5/bbl in the budget to produce a total government revenue of
some US$15.5 billion.  However, as the current oil price is around
US$16/bbl, there is a likelihood that actual revenue will be above
the budget figure.

Current expenditure is put at Ir31,934.7 billion, up by 15%. Rises in
the salaries of civil servants, transfer payments and grants amount
to Ir10.950 billion and account for 20% of the government's total
general budget.

Current expenditures on defense, education and training, health care,
and social security have risen sharply.  Defense expenditure is
slated to increase by 30.7%, from this year, to Ir5,900 billion,
while spending on education and training is to rise by 41.7% to
Ir5,256 billion and spending on health care by 11.2% to Ir18,965
billion.  On the other hand, current expenditures for importing oil
products have been cut by 27.8% due to the success of consumption
reduction policies.

Development credits are to rise by 53% to Ir22,684 billion in the
next financial year.  This will bring the ratio of development
expenditures to the government's total general budget to 42% from
34.8% in the current budget.

A number of industrial projects are due to go on stream next year,
including eight food and pharmaceutical plants with 50,000 ton
capacity, chemical plants with a total capacity of 342,000 tons,
metallurgical plants with 20,000 tons capacity, a lamp manufacturing
plant, two automobile spare parts plants, and six non-metals plants
with an annual capacity of 4.7 million tons.

On infrastructure, 2,300 kilometers of roads and 800 kilometers of
railway will be brought into service, including the 165 kilometer
Mashhad-Sarakhs line designed to link the Iranian railway to the
Central Asian network.  Cargo transportation volume is expected to
reach 25.5 million tons compared with 23 million tons this year.
A total of 450,000 new telephone lines are to be installed to bring
the number of villages connected to the national telephone network to
2,220.  Mobile telephone usage is also expected to increase.

In the cooperatives sector, the government is to help set up 3,600
cooperatives with a membership of 319,600 to bring 850 projects into
operation, creating 45,460 new jobs with an investment of Ir3,356
billion, which in turn will enable the building of 70,000 residential
houses.

In the farming sector red meat production is forecast to rise to
685,000 tons, poultry to 660,000 tons, fish to 450,000 tons, milk to
4.7 million tons and total protein from livestock and fisheries to
7.17 million tons.

The budget for state companies, banks and profit-making institutions
affiliated to the government is put at Ir90,284 billion, accounting
for 65.3% of the total budget.

To cater for the needs of the poor, the budgets of organizations
responsible for supporting this group have been increased from
Ir1,243 billion to Ir1,656 billion.  With the rise in the budget set
aside to support the poor, some 1.3 million families consisting of
4.5 million people will come under the government's support.  Of the
funds allocated to elimination of deprivation, Ir76 billion will be
spent on implementing self-employment projects.

Credits allocated to provinces for the year will be Ir2,492.2
billion, 16.2% up.  This money will be spent on education, health
care and infrastructure needs in such as road building, supply of
electricity and drinking water, and production facilities for rural
areas.

Credits earmarked to the deprived regions are increased by 22% to
Ir600 billion. A total of 77% of the figure comes from the provincial
credits and the remaining 23% from the national budget.

Some Ir700 billion has been allocated to reconstruction projects and
compensation payments. Once this money is disbursed 85% of all
reconstruction projects will be completed.

On housing, the government is to provide 31 million sq.m of land for
building 93,000 residential units and will pay a part of the banking
charges on loans granted for buying houses as well as offering
banking subsidies to teachers.  The government will also boost
investment in housing through the formation of credit cooperatives
and housing investment companies.

favor, but the 0.04% who did not.  The regime says that 8,357,560
voted, of which 8,348,700 plumped for seven more years of Saddam
Hussein's leadership.  That means that 8,860 people either spoiled
their ballot papers or, heaven forfend, voted against.

When asked by a reporter who these dissenters might be an election
official ventured the opinion that they might be either mentally ill
or of criminal intent.  Well, mad or bad, they are certainly brave.
It is popularly said it only takes one brave man to make a
difference: Iraq seems to have at least over 8,000 of them.

Clearly buoyed up by the success of the referendum exercise,
President Hussein has announced that elections to the National
Assembly will be held early next year, possibly in February or March,
and carried out a limited reshuffle of his government on November 6.
Education Minister Hikmat Abdullah al-Bazzaz was made adviser at the
presidency and replaced as education minister by Abd al-Jabbar Tawfiq
Muhammad. Irrigation Minister Nizar Mum'ah was replaced by Housing
and Reconstruction Minister, Mahmud Dhiyab al-Ahmad, and Abd al-Ilah
Hamid Muhammad Salih was appointed minister of agriculture.

Finally, just to confirm that the people's love of President Hussein
is diminished only in so far as they also idolize his son, Uday
Saddam Hussein was unanimously reconfirmed as president of the
executive council of the National Union of Iraqi Students on November
29 and given the powers of the Union's general assembly.

In an "Alice in Wonderland" message to senior state officials on
November 5, President Hussein said that all people were equal before
the law, whether or not they were members of the Ba'th party and that
those who abused their positions to gain favors for their own or
their families' benefit were unfit to hold positions of
responsibility.

It would appear that the message was prompted by the fact that under
the UN sanctions corruption is getting out of control - out of the
control of the Hussein family that is.  In fact, corruption,
particularly in diverting humanitarian aid, had become so blatant
that the government was forced to cut down on the number of fingers
in the till.

The problem was that an investigation a few months ago not only
unearthed evidence of the activities of one particular group of
officials, but also, inadvertently, implicated two high-ranking
officials Major-General Najm al-din al-Naqshabandi, the former senior
undersecretary at the Ministry of Interior, and Major-General Hatim
Ali Khalaf, another former senior Interior Ministry official, as well
as a number of lesser mortals.

The problem for the regime in this is that the two generals are both
closely associated with it, particularly with President Saddam's son,
Uday.  Given that the group had set up a network of foreign agents to
help them launder the moneys gained from diverting funds, intended
for humanitarian purposes, from various international agencies, it
was presumably feared that if they were made to suffer in any way,
the foreign agents working for the two men might release information
that would not only implicate close members of the ruling family, but
also impede their continued personal access to such funds.

Against this background it came as no real surprise that the case
against the two generals never came to court.  In late November the
National Assembly, in a special vote, acquitted both of all charges.
Their less well-placed confederates, however, have all been sent to
trial on charges of illegal acquisition of land, cars and funds.
They are Major-General Hashim Muhammad Faraj, Major-General Wa'd
Mahmud Sulayman and Dr Majid Khurshid.

But the referendum, the promise of parliamentary elections and
fulminations against corruption change nothing.  The UN sanctions
remain in place and the regime is only able to hang on to power
through the its ruthless imposition of a police state and the
constant weeding out of anyone though to present even the slightest
risk.  This combination of privation due to sanctions and fear of
falling suspect produces a continuing stream of defections from the
army to the Kurdish zone in the north.

A group of high-ranking officers reportedly defected to northern Iraq
shortly before the presidential referendum.  It included one
brigadier-general, two colonels and a major.  One of the defectors is
Colonel Yusuf Khalaf Khaffaji, the commander of the Second Battalion
of Brigade 116.

Iraqi Kurdistan
The three northern provinces of Sulaymaniya, Arbil and Dohuk, which
form Iraqi Kurdistan and have been under UN protection in the form of
a no-fly zone since the 1991 Gulf war, continues to be riven by
feuding between the Kurds themselves.  However, just as the two main
Iraqi Kurdish groups - the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) - are inching towards settling their
differences, heavy fighting has broken out between the KDP and the
militant Turkish Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).

KDP versus PUK
The KDP, which is led Mas'ud Barzani, occupies the western part of
Kurdistan and leans towards Turkey, while the PUK, which is led by
Jalal Talabani and occupies the southern part of the territory comes
under the influence of Iran.  The KDP is headquartered in the
hill-top town of Salahuddin, while the PUK has occupied the "capital"
of Kurdistan, Arbil.

The two groups have been fighting each other since 1994 when their
innate rivalry became uncontainable.  Its effect has been to destroy
the dream that the internationally observed elections in the region
in 1992 would lead to the establishment of a parliamentary democracy
in the region.  Instead it has only served to exacerbate the tribal,
linguistic and regional differences that Saddam Hussein exploited to
such effect in his efforts to break the back of Kurdish resistance.
Indeed, the KDP's West Kurdistan and the PUK's South Kurdistan have
virtually the same boundaries now as the old Kurdish principalities.

The fighting reached a peak in July, just before the two sides
attended US-sponsored peace talks in Dublin, when each launched
massive tit-for-tat attacks on the other's headquarters.  Hundreds
died for absolutely no gain.
However, the talks in Dublin, Ireland in August and September broke
down.  This failure opened the door for Iranian mediation, which led
to the holding of peace talks in Tehran between October 5-9.

To the USA's exasperation, these talks did actually produce a partial
agreement.  Most notably the PUK and KDP agreed to a cease-fire and,
in principle, set May 4, 1996 as the date for new elections.  Both
sides also agreed to accept the results of the election
unconditionally.

However, Iranian involvement went much further than this.   First,
the cease-fire is to be monitored by the Iranian controlled Supreme
Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SAIRI).  Second, it was
also agreed Iraqi Shi'is located in Iran should participate in
Kurdish operations against Saddam Hussein's forces.  To this end,
Iran dispatched armed units of Iraqi Shi'is to Iraqi Kurdistan in
November.  According to an announcement from the Iraqi National
Congress, the units fare from the Imam Ali Regiment, Badr Brigade,
and have been deployed around Sulaymaniyah.

The hand of Iran is also seen in the car bombing of the offices of
the main Iranian opposition group, the Mojahedin-e Khalq, in central
Baghdad on November 27.  The explosion damaged buildings and shops in
the area but caused no casualties.  The organization blamed the
Iranian embassy in Baghdad of being responsible for the explosion,
the 36th to target the center since 1993.

All this is anathema to the USA, which desperately wants to keep Iran
out of an increasingly fractious situation.  In an attempt to regain
the initiative it dispatched a delegation to Iraqi Kurdistan in
November under the leadership of Robert Deutsch, head of the northern
Persian Gulf desk at the US State Department.  Deutsch held separate
talks with both Barzani and Talabani, but it is not clear that any
concrete progress, over and above that already made in Tehran, was
achieved.

However, there are intimations that Deutsch found a more sympathetic
reception from Talabani than from Barzani.  If true, this could
complicate matters further as Talabani's PUK depends heavily on Iran,
while the KDP, at least for the moment, is more closely allied to the
West, in the form of Turkey, due to its ongoing battles with the
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).  The difficulty for US mediation
efforts is that it is committed to maintaining the territorial
integrity of Iraq, while most Kurds, in both the KDP and PUK, want to
establish Iraqi Kurdistan as an independent sovereign state.

KDP versus PKK
To add to these troubles a virtual war has now sprung up between the
PKK and the KDP on the Iraqi Kurdistan side of the Iraqi-Turkish
border.  Conflict between the two organizations flared up after
Turkey's second cross-border assault on PKK positions in July.  The
PKK believes that the Turkish army received at least tacit support
from the KDP, which relies on Turkish government goodwill to for
maintaining its cross-border supplies.

When the Turkish troops withdrew, the PKK launched a series of
attacks on KDP positions.  The KDP counter-attacked in force in
September.  In the initial assaults it claimed to have killed or
injured more than 1,000 PKK members out of a force of 2,500 in one
area.

The KDP kept up its attacks on the PKK through October and November.
It its reports are to be believed the PKK has suffered heavy damage,
both in men and materiel.  Turkey has officially offered its
assistance to the KDP in its fight with the PKK.  The KDP maintains
that it has not accepted such support.  Whether or not this is true,
relations between the KDP and the Turkish government are, to say the
least, cordial.  The same cannot be said of the PUK which has
steadfastly refused to become what it calls a Turkish gendarmerie to
fight the PKK.

The leader of the PKK, Anbdullah Ocalan, who is based in Syria and
Jordan called for a cease-fire in early November, but when the KDP
called on his to surrender the fighting continued.

Jordan
Although political relations may have been strained by the defection
of Hussein Kamel Hassan and his brother in August, it appears King
Hussein is not prepared to take risk with his economy by downgrading
trade links with Iraq, particularly with regard to oil.  On September
11, representatives of the two countries signed a memorandum of
understanding on oil issues in Baghdad, which will ensure that trade
relations between Jordan and Iraq will remain as tight as ever.

The memorandum not only contains an agreement to establish an
Iraqi-Jordanian company for oil studies and development, but
additional agreements to build a Jordanian-Iraqi refinery in Aqaba
and to construct an Iraqi pipeline to the Zarqa refinery in Jordan.

The Aqaba refinery is to have an initial capacity of 140,000 barrels
per day (b/d) with the option to increase this to 250,000 refined
b/d.  The projected capacity of the 600-km pipeline is put at an
initial 100,000 b/d, with the option to increase to 350,000 b/d in
the second stage.  The objective of the pipeline is to replace the
current system of road tanker transportation.  Currently the shipment
of Iraqi oil from Baghdad to the port of Aqaba employs 1,500 tanker
trucks.

In addition to these oil sector projects, discussions are also
underway on boosting cooperation in electricity generation and
distribution and in industrial cooperation in such sectors as
pharmaceuticals, canning and packaging, and engineering in general.

IRAQ
ECONOMY

The UN decision to maintain sanctions against Iraq despite the wealth
of new information on its various programs for "weapons of mass
destruction" handed over after the defection of the Kamel brothers
and the referendum of Saddam Hussein's presidency in October, is
extremely bad news for the people of Iran.

The impoverishment of the country already underway as a result of the
eight-year war with Iran, has accelerated under the UN sanctions.
While the GDP per head has plummeted, inflation has soared.  A kebab
which cost Id2 in 1990 now costs Id800.

According to the UN's World Food program in Baghdad, four million
people in the country are now short of food, while the rate of child
malnutrition in central and southern Iraq is now higher than in
Sudan.  Infant mortality has reportedly increased by more than 25% a
year.

However, with no progress in sight on Iraq being able to meet the
conditions for lifting the sanctions the UN aid agencies are finding
it increasingly difficult to get the donor countries to keep coughing
up the funds to maintain the population in its present parlous state.
In October the UN launched an appeal for US$183.3 million t fund
humanitarian programs in the country.  Although the sum asked for is
lower than previous requests the total has still not been met and
only 30% of the UN's funding requests have been raised since 1991.
The USA gives no aid to Iraq as a whole, but channels all that it
does give exclusively to the Kurdish controlled north.

So far Saddam Hussein has resisted taking the opt-out of UN
resolution 986 of April of this year, which allows Iraq to sell US$2
billion worth of oil over six months exclusively for humanitarian
purposes.  The regime has refused to take up the option on the
grounds that the close monitoring involved is an affront to its
sovereignty.  There must, however, be a question as to how much
longer the resistance can be maintained.

ON the other hand, if Iraq does decide to take advantage of
Resolution 986 it could cause sever problems for other oil producers,
particularly neighboring Gulf countries which are counting on the
recent firming of international oil prices to get their economies
back in shape.  At their recent meeting OPEC members decided to
maintain the current output limits in order to maintain prices at
their current level.

However, the input of Iraqi oil in the market could upset the
delicate price stability that has been achieved and drive prices
down.  As the Resolution is concerned with revenue rather than
quantity, any fall in prices would force Iraq to increase sales in
order to reach the target figure of US$1 billion every three months.
The increased output would have a further knock-on effect on prices
and could produce a downward price spiral.  While that would be good
news for the consumer countries - those most concerned with
maintaining the sanctions - it could have a disastrous effect on the
other oil producing countries in the region.

Meanwhile, the government is trying to make up for a shortage of
household gas in the coming winter.  In the first and second quarters
of 1995 production of domestic gas was around 3,400 tonnes a day.
The aim is to raise this to 4,600 tons a day in the final quarter of
the year.

But production is only part of the problem.  The gas has to be
transported to the gas bottle filling stations in the towns.  As a
result of the sanctions - with spare parts like tires and batteries
in short supply, transportation costs have soared.

JANUARY 1996

ISRAEL
POLITICS

Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's Labor Party prime minister
only since 1992, was shot on the evening of November 4 while
attending a peace rally in Tel Aviv.  He died a short while later in
hospital.  His murderer was an Israeli Jew, Yigal Amir, a 27-year old
law student at Bar Ilan University and a member of Eyal, a militant
nationalist/religious group opposed to the peace process.

The murder of their prime minister by another Jew was not only a
physical blow against the governance of the state, but also a massive
psychological blow against the people at large.  In this single act,
Yigal Amir forced the Israeli people to admit that they too have been
as subverted by the struggle to retain the occupied territories as
have the Palestinian people in their effort to retrieve them.

This subversion probably began with the disastrous invasion of
Lebanon in June 1982, was compounded by the massive increase in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank under the same Likud government,
and reached its final expression in the massacre of Palestinians at
prayer in the mosque of the Cave of the Patriarchs by an American
immigrant settler, Baruch Goldstein, in February 1994.

What was palpably obvious, but never before admitted, was that the
militant Israeli groups that sprung up among the West Bank settlers
and their supporters in Israel proper was that they had the backing,
direct and indirect, of the Israeli government.  In confrontations
between the settlers and their Palestinian neighbors, the Israeli
security forces and government could always be counted on to be
partisan.

After the Cave of the Patriarchs atrocity, the organization to which
Goldstein belonged, Kakh, was declared illegal.  However, its members
were then absorbed by two other groups Eyal, led by Avishay Raviv,
and Kahana Hay, led by Binyamin Kahana.  The connection between these
groups and Kakh is underlined by the fact that the man responsible
for securing funds for Kakh, Herbert Sunshein, is also responsible
for securing funds for the other two groups.  And yet, the
authorities made no moves against either Eyal or Kahana Hay.  On the
contrary, it appears to have been deeply involved in both.

It now appears that members of the Israeli internal intelligence
service Shabak (formerly Shin Bet) were deeply involved in Eyal and
were aware on a day-to-day basis of its activities, including alleged
fatal attacks on Palestinian civilians.  This could be seen as proper
infiltration of a militant group by the authorities.  But if it was
merely infiltration in order to secure intelligence, why did it fail
to secure any information that could be used against the
organization's claimed attacks on Palestinians, let alone the murder
of Rabin?  One conclusion must be that the security forces were
supporting and encouraging Eyal's anti-Palestinian activities.

It never seems to have occurred to the Israeli people at large, and
particularly to the main political parties and the security services,
that they were breeding vipers in their breast, vipers that would one
day turn and bite their mentors. Hence the shock when a member of one
of those groups did exactly that by assassinating Rabin.

Thus it was that while security around Rabin was extra-high during
the peace rally, his bodyguards were looking only for Arab assassins,
particularly after the murder by the Israeli secret services of the
Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shkaki outside his hotel in Malta, only a
few days previously.

It also appears that the mass militarization of the people worked
against society in that Amir put into practice the skills gained
during his compulsory military service.  It has been reported that
Amir was employed by Shabak in 1992 and that he used the techniques
he learnt then to carry out the assassination.

The response of Eyal's fund-raiser, Sunshein, to Rabin's murder was
to say his death "proves that God is in the world...On November 4
when Rabin was shot, at the same time, on the Western calendar, Meir
Kahana was assassinated."

The New Government
The murder of Rabin threw the right-wing Likud into disarray.  On the
death of the prime minister the deputy prime minister, foreign
minister Shimon Peres automatically became caretaker.  If there is
one man the Likud leadership views with even greater distaste than it
viewed Yitzhak Rabin, that man is Shimon Peres, regarded by many on
the right in Israeli politics as the real architect of the peace plan
and therefore the arch traitor to the nation.

But with Rabin slaughtered, as Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu put
it, by another Jew, the party could not in conscience oppose Peres'
forming a new government as Israel's next prime minister.  Again in
the words of Netanyahu, "political murder must not disrupt the
continuity of government in a democratic republic".   As a result,
Likud abstained in the parliamentary vote on the new government
despite having "no confidence in the path of the new government, just
as we had no confidence in its predecessor's path".

Although some parties like the Moledet insisted that they would still
vote against him, Likud's abstention from the upcoming parliamentary
vote removed the only real obstacle to Peres forming a new government
under his leadership.

The assassination brought a closing of ranks in the Labor Party, with
two defectors - Shmuel Avital and Amir Peretz of the New Life
Movement - returning to the fold.  However, Peres wanted more than
that.

Immediately on assuming the role of caretaker, Peres attempted to
broaden the coalition he had inherited from Rabin through the
inclusion of one or more of the religious parties such as the
National Religious Party (NRP), United Torah Jewry, Tzomet and the
Torah Observing Sephardim (Shas).  To this end he intimated he would
accept some of their demands on religious issues.

This upset his existing coalition partner, the secular Meretz party,
which threatened to leave the government if the NRP was brought in.
This forced Peres to change tack and seek instead to secure the
support of the religious parties in parliament, without including
them in the coalition, by agreeing a "document of understanding" with
them.  However, he insisted that while Meretz would still be in the
coalition it would have no right of veto over negotiations with other
parties.

Some of these parties would appear to make unlikely bedfellows.  Only
a few days after Rabin's murder, the Tzomet chairman and member of
parliament (MP), Refael Eytan, quoted to high school students Article
29 of the Penal Code, which he claimed stipulated that anyone who
hands over lands belonging to the state risks the death penalty.
The clear inference was that Rabin had committed such a crime.

The same article is used by the militant groups to justify their
actions.  In fact, the article refers only to acts of treason, such
as espionage, as determined by a court of law.  Moreover, it cannot
be applied to occupied territories as they are just that, occupied
territories and not legally part of the sovereign state of Israel.

In any event, Peres still had to retreat further to secure the
continued support of Meretz.  On November 21, Labor agreed with
Meretz that all new religious laws would require an a priori
agreement by all members of the coalition.  In other words, Meretz
has got its veto.

With that matter settled the new government was formed on November 22
as follows:

Shimon Peres - prime minister and defense minister (Labor)
Shulamit Aloni - minister of communications, science and the arts
(Meretz)
Yosi Beilin - minister in the prime minister's office (Labor)
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer - construction and housing minister (Labor)
Uzi Baram - minister of tourism (Labor)
Ehud Baraq - foreign minister (Labor)
Mikha Harish - industry and trade minister (Labor)
David Libai - justice minister (Labor)
Ora Namir - labor and welfare minister (Labor)
Efrayim Sne - health minister (Labor)
Rabbi Yehuda Amital - minister without portfolio (Independent/Meimad)
Yair Tzaban - immigrant absorption minister (Meretz)
Ya'aqov Tzur - agriculture and rural development minister (Labor)
Yisrael Qeysar - transport minister (Labor)
Anon Rubinstein - education, culture and sports minister (Meretz)
Haim Ramon - interior minister (Labor)
Gonen Segev - energy and infrastructure minister (Yiud)
Avraham Shohat - finance minister (Labor)
Moshe Shahal - minister of internal security (Labor)
Shimon Shetrit - minister of religious affairs (Labor)
Yosi Sarid - environment minister (Meretz)

The first major surprise in the line-up was Peres' decision to take
on the defense portfolio, appointing Ori Or as his deputy.  The
second was his shake-up of the foreign ministry.  As Peres's
elevation to the premiership had left the foreign portfolio vacant,
it was natural enough for it to be filled, as it was by Ehud Baraq,
the former chief of staff.  However, Peres went much further by
appointing the former deputy foreign minister, Yosi Beilin, to his
own office and transferring responsibility for negotiations with
Syria from Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to Washington, to
the director-general of the Foreign Ministry Uri Savir, who is
already responsible for negotiations with the Palestinians.

The third surprise was the creation of a new Ministry of Internal
Security, under the former Police Affairs minister, Moshe Shahal,
made up of three commands - the police, the prisons service and the
Home Front Command.  The creation of this ministry now leaves the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) (i.e. the military services) on
concentrating its efforts on external threats to state security.

The effect of these three measures is to massively increase the
powers of the prime minister's office in three critical areas -
defense, the peace negotiations and internal security.

There is little doubt that Rabin's assassination has been a setback
for the right, particularly for the main party opposing the peace
plan - Likud.  Nevertheless, the forces ranged against any further
moves remain large and, if the various splits are ignored, there is
still a possible majority against the peace process.

Thankfully, however, the right continues to fissure.  Yet another new
hard-line right-wing party was officially registered on November 14.
Named the Yamin Yisrael (Israel's Right) it plans to contest the next
general election.  Appeals were lodged against its registration on
the basis that it is a racist party representing illegal positions,
but these were rejected by the party registrar.

Yamin Yisrael was established by MP Shaul Gutman, who split from
Moledet, and Miryam Lapid from Qiryat Arba, the settlement that
produced Baruch Goldstein.  It advocates the expulsion of Arabs and
insists that any partition of Eretz Yisrael (i.e. Israel plus the
West Bank, or Judea and Samaria) be prohibited by law.  It also calls
for the building of a Jewish temple on the Temple Mount.  The number
two in the party is Rahamin Kohen, a former Kakh movement executive.

Peace Process
The Oslo B agreement, singed by prime Minister Rabin and PLO leader
Yasser Arafat in Taba on September 28, was approved by the Israeli
parliament on October 6 by 61 votes to 59, with all 120 members of
parliament attending.  The Labor members Qahalani and Zismann voted
against.  It was the third agreement concluded between Israel and the
Palestinians in the occupied territories, the first being the
Declaration of Principles singed on September 13, 1993 in Washington,
and the second, the so-called Cairo Agreement signed on May 4, 1994.

Overall, the agreement covers the withdrawal of Israeli control from
further areas of the occupied West Bank and its replacement by
Palestinian control, and the holding of elections in the Palestinian
areas in January 1996.  Once that is achieved further talks will be
held to secure another agreement on the vacation by Israel of further
areas.

However, such further withdrawal is to be severely limited.  In
presenting the Taba agreement to parliament Rabin insisted Israel
will not return to the 1967 borders.  Instead, the security border
for the state of Israel will be situated in Jordan Rift Valley "along
the broadest possible interpretation of that term".  As a result, the
Etyzyon Bloc, Efrat, Betar and other settlements, mostly situated
east of the pre-Six-Day-War Green line will become an integral part
of the state of Israel.  In addition, Israel intends to keep the
whole of Jerusalem, including Ma'ale Adumim and Givat Ze'ev, as the
undivided capital of the state of Israel.

The aim of all this, said Rabin, is to create an internationally
recognized sovereign state of Israel and a Palestinian "entity",
which will "manage the lives of the Palestinians under its
jurisdiction", will be "less than a state".

To say that this is contentious hardly addresses the issues raised.
The Palestinians have conceded much, i.e. their country, with the aim
of achieving their own state with Jerusalem as its capital. However,
here is the Israeli government stating categorically that neither of
those aims will never be achieved.  Prime Minister Peres has repeated
all of Prime Minister's Rabin's statement.

If that is Israel's stance, what will there be to discuss on the
fourth round?  There certainly will be no point in the Palestinians
attempting to negotiate on the issues.  In his first public
appearance as foreign minister on November 23, Ehud Baraq told Labor
party members that Israel would secure all of these demands "because
we are stronger".

This seems to us to be a recipe for disaster ahead and a guarantee
that terrorism will continue.

Meanwhile, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the additional areas
outlined in the Taba agreement have proceeded to plan.  Under this,
Israel was due to vacate the Jenin area during the period October 25
through November 19, the Tulkarm region by December 10, Nablus and
Qalqilyah by December 17, Bethlehem by December 20 and Ramallah on
December 31.  Withdrawal from Hebron is to be completed in March.

The Palestine National Authority (PNA) took control of Jenin on
November 13, taking authority over transport, communications and
meteorological responsibilities.  The process of vacating Nablus and
Tulkarm began at around the same time and the vacation of Bethlehem
and Hebron on November 15.  On November 28, 15 Palestinian officers
arrived in the city of Qalqilyah to coordinate the takeover of the
city by the PNA on December 18-26.

It has not been an entirely peaceful affair, however.  There were
violent clashes in Nablus between youths and the Israeli occupation
forces at the end of November. Youths blocked the streets with
barricades and burning tires and pelted Israeli patrols with stones.
Soldiers responded by firing shots and rubber bullets and throwing
percussion grenades.  A total of 23 people were injured.  After calm
was restored two Israeli Border Police were abducted in Jenin.  In
addition, the Israeli security forces killed a wanted Hamas (Islamic
Resistance Movement) member south of Hebron on November 28.  He was
Muhammad Nasir Musalimah.  The house in which he was hiding was first
surrounded and then shelled with antitank rockets.  The house, with
the body of Musalimah still inside, was then bulldozed to the ground.
In reiterating Prime Minister Rabin's minimum territorial demands,
Prime Minister Peres said that the negotiations about the permanent
arrangement, due to last three years, will start in May 1996, and
said that he did not believe that anything significant pertaining to
the permanent arrangement would be decided before the parliamentary
elections in October next year.

Elections in the Palestinian areas are due to be held on January 20.
The election date was set by the Palestinian National Authority on
November 4 - the day Rabin was murdered.  Registration of voters
started on November 12.  There will be 66 European observers..

PALESTINIAN AFFAIRS
In September, the PNA reached an agreement with the World Bank
whereby international aid would henceforth be transferred directly to
the PNA, and not to the Palestinian Economic Committee on Development
and Reconstruction (PECDAR).  The PLO set up PECDAR, headed by Abu
Ala (Ahmad Quray), as the official address for international aid to
the PNA soon after signing the Oslo accord.

The PNA's various offices competed to take over responsibility for
the aid funds, including Nabil Sha'th, the head of the Planning and
International Cooperation Ministry, and to Abu Ala, who is also the
head of the Ministry of Economy.  However, it was agreed that the
bulk of the funds will go to the Finance Ministry headed by Muhammad
al-Nashashibi.

This is not only a blow to Sha'th and Abu Ala, but, as Nashashibi is
very close to Yasser Arafat, but also ensures that Arafat will be
able to control the distribution of the funds.  This will provide
enormous political benefits and will enhance his powers of patronage
even further.

Unemployment
Israel has imposed further restrictions on Palestinian workers in
Israel despite reopening the border on October 17.  On the eve of the
closure, some 35,000 Palestinians were employed in Israel.  However,
on lifting the closure Israel allowed entry to only 26,600, making
another 8,400 unemployed.

As of the opening only men of 35 years and older are allowed into
Israel from Gaza.  Before the closure, the minimum age was 30.  The
minimum age for Palestinian workers from the West Bank was raised
from 28 to 30.  In both cases, only married men are allowed to work
in Israel.

The civilian work force in the West Bank stands at 250,000 of whom
190,000 are employed in the region.  According to Civil
Administration data, the unemployment rate stands at 10%, some 25,000
people.  Some 60,000 Palestinians are employed in the self-rule area,
while some 14,000 work in Israel and the Eretz area.  The PNA claims
that the unemployment rate in the Gaza Strip is almost 50% of the
work force.

Dr. Fu'ad Bsisu, governor of the PNA fiscal authority, has warned
that unemployment might reach 32% in the West Bank and Gaza by the
beginning of this year.  He said that after 28 years of occupation
the restructuring of the Palestinian economy requires a strong
banking sector.

Finance & Aid
In this respect, a banking study prepared by the Palestinian fiscal
authority has reported that total deposits in the banks operating in
Palestine reached US$975 million at the end of May 1995, reflecting a
US$387 million, 65%, increase on the end of December 1994.  Total
client deposits in the PNA areas reached US$538 million at the end of
May, reflecting a US$286 million increase, or 48%.  In the West Bank,
total deposits up to the end of May reached US$437 million, an
increase of 30% on the end of December 1994.

According to the study, Gaza and Jericho are the major contributors
to bank deposits in Palestine, contributing 55%.  Judging by the
demographic structure, Gaza inhabitants represent 38% of the
population and account for 25% of the GNP. The study notes that
Gaza's share of commercial bank deposits is 55% of the total deposits
in Palestine.  This indicates relative political and economic
stability in the PNA areas.

Foreign Aid
A European Union delegation, headed by Spanish Foreign Minister
Javier Solana, now the new head of NATO, signed an agreement for the
provision of US$300 million in soft loans to the PNA on October 27.
The sum is part of the 1993 grant of US$600 million offered by the EU
in 1993.  The money will be used to set up large-scale water,
electricity and commercial projects.

In November, the PNA's donor group recommended offering US$75 million
to cover the deficit in the Palestinian budget and US$600 million to
finance investment and social projects.  The sums were due to be
approved during the donor countries' ministerial meeting in Paris on
December 9.

Israeli Settlement Expansion
Also in October the Peace Now settlement monitoring team claimed that
the construction of 1,400 new housing units had started in the Jewish
settlements of the West Bank since the start of this year.  Peace Now
also claimed that some 6,000 apartments are currently in various
stages of construction in the territories.  When they are inhabited,
the apartments will provide a significant boost to the population of
the Israeli settlements.  In the organization's view this will
seriously harm the political process.

It further claims that overall some 3,800 housing units have been
completed this year in the area dubbed Greater Jerusalem after the
work was approved by the special ministerial committee.  Another
3,900 apartments will be built over the next year or so in the area
between Ma'ale Adumim, the Etyzon Bloc and Giv'at Ze'ev.

Peace Now surveyed each Israeli settlement individually.  It claims
that the total number of apartments under construction last year is
the largest number since the Likud government.  If all the apartments
currently being built are inhabited, some 25,000 additional settlers
will be moving in.

However, the government rejected the organization's claims.
According to the then housing and construction minister, Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, the ministerial committee charged with approving
construction projects in the occupied territories had approved the
construction of only 500 housing units in Ma'ale Adumim, the
continued construction of some 500 housing units in Betar, and work
on privately-owned land in Giv'at Ze'ev, which had not yet started.

As for Tel Aviv, the minister did admit that some 95,000 housing
units are being built, with a further 1,100 housing units in Psigat
Ze'ev in Greater Jerusalem.

LEBANON
The continuing state of tension in the Israeli security zone in
southern Lebanon rose by several more degrees in October when six
Israeli soldiers were killed by a booby-trap bomb in the eastern
sector.  The deaths provoked a massive Israeli reaction of targeted
air attacks over the next several weeks.  Each of which was met with
retaliatory action from the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) and Hezbollah.

In mid-November Israel intensified its bombardment of southern areas
and carried out a massive air attack against PFLP-GC positions in the
Na'mah hills, inflicting a large number of fatalities.  Following the
attack, the PFLP-GC reportedly began dismantling its bases in Na'mah
as a precautionary measure against further strikes.

As for the bombardment, attacks on alleged Hezbollah villages on
November 27 reportedly killed a number of ranking members of the
organization.  Hezbollah claimed that Israel used nail and
fragmentation bombs in the attack and said it had it had no honorable
alternative but to respond with the weapons it has to hand, namely
the Katyusha rockets.

The next day Hezbollah fired a "relatively large number" of Katyusha
rockets into northern Israel in two salvos.  The missiles struck the
area around Qiryat Shimona in the Galilee but there were no reported
fatalities.

The attack produced fury in Israel, with Prime Minister stating that
the attack was a blatant breach of the understanding reached after
the Israeli operation in Lebanon n 1993.  He went on to assign full
responsibility to the Lebanese and Syrian governments.  In
particular, he noted that Syria had to be held responsible for the
actions of Hezbollah because it has a military deployment in the
country.

Backing up the prime minister, deputy defense minister Ori Or said
Israel will make Hezbollah, Lebanon and Syria "pay the price" for the
attacks.  However, the military had already issued a statement that
Syria had nothing to do with the attacks.  Israel is also limited in
its response by its need to keep the peace process on track.  After
all this is the fifth time Israel has vowed to retaliate after
Katyushas have been fired into northern Israel, and it has not done
so yet.

So, the result has been more of the same. On November 28 a member of
Hezbollah's security committee in Jibshit was killed when his car was
blown up, either form a bomb or a rocket fired by an Israeli plane.
On November 30 Israeli warplanes carried out three air raids on the
ridges located between Mashgharah and Ayn al-Tinah firing 500 and
1,000-pound air-to-ground missiles.

Israel is also still enforcing its restriction on maritime traffic
inside Lebanese territorial waters. In Late October it was reported
that Israel had stepped up its patrols all along the coast between
Naqurah and Sarafand, imposing a tight blockade on the ports from
which Lebanese fishermen operate.  Fishing boats also claim to have
been subjected to machine-gun fire along the coast south of Tyre.

On November 19, Israeli gunboats detained two Lebanese fishermen.
They were released the next day with a map stipulating that fishing
is only allowed in a one-kilometer area off Tyre's northern beaches.
On November 30, Israeli gunboats seized two ships with a cargo of
cars heading for Tyre.

ISRAEL
ECONOMY

In addition to saying that he would hold the Rabin line on the peace
process, Prime Minister Peres also committed himself to pursuing the
same general thrust in economic policy.  That, however, is a line he
may find difficult to hold.

Certainly, the past few years have been the best ever in Israel's
socioeconomic history with GDP growth averaging nearly 5.6% over from
1991 through 1994.  However inflation has been stubbornly resistant
to the government's tight monetary policy.  Although the rate fell to
around 9% last year from 12.3% in 1994, growth started to pick up
rapidly in the second half of the year, stoking up inflationary
pressures.   Growth last year could well have been as high as 6.8%.
This year Finance Minister Avraham Shohat has forecast a GDP growth
of 6.8% and there is a strong possibility that inflation will rise
again.

This is alarming.  Interest rates are already very high.  In October
last the central bank raised its key lending rate charged to
commercial banks 13.7% to 14.2%.  This brought a sharp halt to a
gradual fall in  the rate from a high of 17% in November 1994.

Moreover, the budget deficit situation is also worsening.  According
to the latest forecasts, the fiscal deficit is expected to turn out
at 3.6% of GDP in 1995, compared with 0.9% in 1994 and well in excess
of the government target of 2.75%.

European Union
Israel and the EU signed an economic agreement at the EU's Council of
Ministers in Brussels on November 20.  This is the largest and most
important international economic agreement signed by Israel.  It
replaces the agreement signed about 20 years ago and includes
elements that will improve and enhance the ties between Israel and
the EU countries.

JORDAN
POLITICS

Concern is rising both in the government and abroad over the
heightened level of opposition to the peace agreement with Israel.
The problem was brought into focus by a recent debate on the peace
process in parliament in which a number of deputies opposed the
government line.  The opposition was led by the Islamic Action Front,
but supported by more than 13 nationalist, leftist and even centrist
deputies.

This was followed by the rejection of the government's normalization
of relations with Israel by the trade unions.  The government was
also discomfited when in a democratic election the Islamists and
leftists who oppose the it scored a landslide victory in the branch
elections of the Jordan Engineers' Association.

This has led some observers to claim the country is teetering on the
brink of a bloody confrontation between proponents and opponents of
the peace.  Their argument is that this fundamental political
division in the country is exacerbated by Jordan's purely domestic
problems such as the high level of unemployment which is officially
put at 18% of the workforce, growing poverty and hardship, and the
widespread corruption in the government and bureaucracy.

This mix is made worse, they contend, by Jordan's open door policy on
immigration.  Thus, Islamic militants have moved into Jordan from
other countries in the region with the express intent of fomenting
trouble.  Finally, there is the continuous external pressure
generated by the continued UN sanctions against Iraq and the
suffering of its people to the east and the stand-off between Syria
and Israel to the north.

This does at least appear to have the USA worried.  According to the
Jordanian newspaper Akhbar al-Usbu, the USA has been involved in
secret discussion with exiled Jordanian opposition groups and some
opposition groups inside the country.

Also, the government's move in October and November to cut the number
of foreign workers in the country cannot be entirely unconnected with
these concerns.  According to Labor Minister Nader Abu el-Shaer, the
foreign workforce of around 250,000 was cut by 70,000 in October
alone.  The hope is that this action will both cut down on the number
of potential foreign agitators and help to ease the unemployment
situation for low-paid workers.

Saudi Arabia
To King Hussein's enormous relief, normal relations have been
restored with Saudi Arabia and ambassadors exchanged.  The Saudi
ambassador arrived in Amman on November 11.  King Hussein is expected
to make a visit to Saudi Arabia soon.

It was also announced that the defunct pipeline, which used to carry
40,000 barrels of Saudi oil to Jordan daily, is to be repaired and
put back into operation.

Iraq
Despite the improvement in relations with Saudi Arabia, King Hussein
is still treading a political tightrope in his relations with Iraq.
So far his condemnation of the regime has been in non-specific terms
and he has taken care not to criticize Saddam Hussein personally.
This has been essential in that Jordan is still economically
dependent on Iraq (for details of the recent trade agreement see the
Iraq report in this issue) and that the majority of the Jordanian
people are sympathetic to the political message emanating from
Baghdad.

At the same time, however, he cannot afford to alienate either Saudi
Arabia or Kuwait.  To this end, King Hussein reportedly made contacts
with some Iraqi opposition groups during his private visit to London
recently.  This, however, brought criticism from a rather unusual
quarter, the pretender to the Iraqi throne, Sharif Ali Bin
al-Hussein.  In late November Sharif Ali, who is a member of the
Hashemite family to which King Hussein belongs, said such contacts
constituted a threat to the integrity of Iraq.

Apparently, Sharif Ali, who heads an organization called the Iraqi
Constitutional Monarchy Movement and hopes to have himself installed
as a constitutional monarch in Iraq after Saddam Hussein is brought
down, fears that Iraq in its present divided state is ripe for
break-up and sees the threat of a confederation between Jordan and
the rump of Iraq should the Kurds succeed in breaking away.

Israel
Despite the domestic protests, however, relations with Israel
continue to forge ahead.  On October 25 the two countries singed a
trade deal which is expected to led to a rapid increase in trade
between them.  Under it Israel has granted Jordan 20-50% exemptions
from customs on most Jordanian industrial products, including cement,
furniture, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and toys.  For its part Jordan
has agreed to reduce its tariffs by 10% on a wide range of Israeli
products, including plywood, tires, foodstuffs, electronic
components, medical and communications equipment and pharmaceuticals.

The agreement takes account of the difference between the Israeli and
Jordanian economies: per capita income in Jordan is less than a
quarter of the level in Israel.  The agreement will be in effect for
three years, after which the terms will be renegotiated.

JORDAN
FINANCE

Jordan finally got its second debt write-off deal with the USA on
September 25.  Under the first deal US$220 million was canceled,
while the second deal removed a further US$400 or so to bring the
total amount of debt canceled to around US$640 million, around 10% of
the country's total foreign debt.

Also in September Japan announced its intention to extend
grants-in-aid totaling N1.12 billion to Jordan.  The aid consists of
N547 million to finance a project aimed at combating oil spill in the
north of the Gulf of Aqaba, N550 million to help the country purchase
agricultural machinery to boost food production, and N24 million
cultural grant-in-aid to help Jordan's radio and TV corporation
purchase educational TV programs.

In late October Japan also announced that it is to provide US$215
million aid package, including a US$135 million loan from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan, to help alleviate Jordan's foreign
exchange shortage.

Last but not least, the European Union is to provide a grant of 20
million European Currency Units (Ecu) to help the kingdom implement
its economic reform program.  The money will be used to finance
projects in the fields of health, education, social development and
water.

In October Moody's Investors Service assigned a Ba3 long term rating
to Jordan's foreign currency debt, while and Standard & Poor's
assigned a B+ rating for the country's foreign currency debt and a
BBB rating for local currency debt.

The country has been discomfited by the call by the United Arab
Emirates for the sanctions against Iraq to be lifted.  It has also
not been pleased for the support for the call from both Qatar and
Yemen.

Meanwhile, the Council of Ministers decided on November 29 to grant a
maximum grace period of one year for those who have not yet managed
to prove their Kuwaiti nationality since the 1965 census.  The aim of
the ruling is to set an absolute deadline on the nationality
registration process. The cabinet also approved the use of DNA
techniques to investigate the family connections claimed by some of
those seeking Kuwaiti nationality.

KUWAIT
ECONOMY

Privatization
The Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) said in November that it now
expects the privatization program to be completed before the target
date of end 1998 as a result of the increasing demand from investors
for shares in the parastatals due to be hived off.

Up to the end of October, the KIA - the body charged by the
government with executing the privatization program - had sold shares
worth Kd310 million (approximately US$1 billion).  Up to that date,
some 15,000 people had subscribed to the shares sold and the monthly
share trading figure had increased from an average of Kd45.3 million
in the first half of 1994 to Kd248.7 million in the first half of
1995.

Private deposits increased from Kd5.5 billion in June 1994 to Kd6.1
billion in August 1995.  In addition the central bank had registered
a decrease in the amount of transfers abroad.

The increase in average share prices in the stock market has led to
similar increases in the value of the portfolio of local shares held
by the state through the KIA.  The value of this portfolio has
increased by more than Kd300 million since July 1994.

The KIA holds more than 10% of the equity of 28 companies.  This
stake is worth around Kd9.24 billion.  Approximately 34.5% of this
total is in the banking sector, some 20.6% in the manufacturing
sector and around 20.5% in the service sector.

Oil Sector
Meanwhile, Oil Minister, Dr. Abd al-Muhsin al-Mid'ij, said in
September that the level of investment the private sector could
contribute to the oil industry after 1997 could be as much as US$10
million.

He said that the Kuwaiti Petroleum Corporation (KPC) is planning to
increase its oil production to three million barrels per day (b/d) by
the beginning of the next century and to around 3.5 million b/d by
the year 2005.  As for the refining sector, the plans are to increase
the volume of oil refined by Kuwait refineries from 800,000 b/d to
around one million b/d by the year 2000.

Prior to the November meeting of OPEC oil and energy ministers in
November, Mid'ij appeared to be urging his partners to raise Kuwait's
production ceiling from 2.0 million b/d to 2.2 million b/d.  However,
Mid'ij also talked of wanting to raise the oil price to US$21/bbl.
Given the excess capacity in the market and an oil price at the time
of around US$16/bbl, the two aims were clearly incompatible.

In the event the OPEC meeting decided to keep the organization's
overall production ceiling at 24.52 million b/d up to the end of June
this year.  As a result, the production ceilings of all member
countries, including Kuwait, will remain the same.  By maintaining
total output against a forecast rise n global demand of 1.4 million
b/d this year, OPEC is hoping that the oil price will rise
significantly towards the US$21/bbl figure this year.

It was announced in October that a new oil deposit has been
discovered in the Kira al-Maru, in western Kuwait.  Outflow from the
new discovery started on October 19.  The outflow is of light oil ,
the first time such oil has been discovered in the area.

The Kuwait Oil Company's exploration at Kira al-Maru began in June
1990, but was halted by the Iraqi invasion.  Work resumed in February
1994.  Preliminary estimates indicate that deposits in the new field
amount to 300-400 million barrels.

Foreign Economic Relations
The Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC) signed a memorandum of
understanding with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in September on the
setting up of a joint oil refinery with an estimated annual capacity
of about six million tonnes - which could be increased to 10 million
tonnes - at a cost of more than US$1 billion.

The project is to be set up and operated in the state of Orissa in
northeast India by a new joint company.  The KPC and IOC will each
hold 26% of the shares of the joint company, while the remaining
shares, 48%, will be offered to individuals and institutions in
India.

The financing of the project depends on the use of the paid capital
and foreign loans.

MOROCCO
POLITICS

Despite the current economic difficulties, the kingdom retains its
moderate political risk.  However, in that King Hassan, by virtue of
his near absolute powers, is the key to political stability there
were some anxious moments in late October when his was taken ill in
New York in the USA.

The king apparently caught influenza which then deteriorated into an
acute respiratory infection.  Although he has apparently recovered
fully and has returned home, he has been advised to take several
weeks recuperation.

Corruption
Meanwhile, the government's latest attempt to cut back on the blatant
corruption in the country resulted in the arrest of more than 2,000
people in mid November.  The arrests resulted from the latest
anti-corruption measures and most of the detentions - 826 - were made
in and around the port city of Casablanca, while the center-north
came second with 423.  Most of those arrested were charged with
attempting to bribe policemen.

The number of arrests sounds impressive but in reality can barely be
described as even the tip of the iceberg.  The whole of the
bureaucracy in Morocco is riven with bribery and "baksheesh", in
which paying policemen to turn a blind eye to parking offenses and
traffic violations is but a minor part.  It is virtually impossible
for a citizen to obtain a building permit, birth certificate, death
certificate or any other official document without money changing
hands under the counter.

Political Terrorism
Although Morocco has no domestic problem with political terrorism,
proof positive has emerged that some of its citizens are taking
advantage of the terrorist activity in neighboring Algeria with the
arrest of a group of arms' smugglers on the Moroccan side of the
border.

Although the arrests were made in mid-September, they were not
announced until mid-October.  There were 17 members in the group, 12
Moroccans and five Algerians.  According to the government, the
Moroccans were either small traders or unemployed, aged between 25
and 40.  The Algerians are believed to be members of the Algerian
terrorist group Groupe Armi Islamique (GIA).  They face prison
sentences of 5-20 years.

Western Sahara
The registration process of voters in the referendum on the future
status of the territory, scheduled for January 1996, continues at a
snail's pace.  In July, the Moroccan government suddenly presented a
further 100,000 application forms for Moroccans its claims originated
from Western Sahara.  This has snarled up the registration process to
such an extent that in November the President of the self-styled
Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), Mohamed Abdelaziz, wrote to
the UN secretary-general warning that the whole process was on the
point of impasse.

Meanwhile, the first elected Saharan National Assembly was installed
at the refugee camps in Tindouf on October 12, to coincide with the
20th anniversary of the proclamation of the SADR. The Assembly
consists of 101 members.

In November, the SADR's armed wing, the Polisario Front released 186
Moroccan prisoners of war.  These men had been released in 1989, but
the Moroccan government refused to receive them on the grounds that
there were no Moroccan POWs.

Relations between the SADR and the Moroccan government also came
under further strain in August, when Morocco opened talks with Russia
on renewing the three-year fishing accord that permits Russian ships
to fish off the Western Saharan coast.

The SADR has always regarded the accord, which was signed in August
1992 as, a deliberate provocation that runs counter to the
UN-brokered peace plan signed by both sides in August 1988.  It also
regards the accord as being part of Morocco's policy of establishing
international legitimacy to its claim of sovereignty over the region
in advance of the referendum.  The accord was the first signed by
Morocco which was limited exclusively to the Western Sahara.

European Union
The long-running dispute with the European Union (EU) over fishing
rights was finally brought to a conclusion on November 15 last as
part of a new partnership agreement.  The EU had hoped to get the
fishing treaty out of the way before the trade accord was dealt with.
However, Morocco, realizing the leverage the fishing deal gave it in
negotiations on the accord hung on until the EU was forced to
consider both together.  The overall result is that Morocco has
secured both agreements under arguably better terms than it would
have done.

It has been a tough negotiation.  When Morocco refused to renew the
existing fisheries agreement when it expired on April 30 last year,
relations between Morocco and the EU, particularly Spain, plunged.
With its fishing vessels barred from Moroccan waters, Spain faced the
loss of around 40,000 jobs in its fishing industry.

Pressure was also on the EU in general as it wanted the partnership
agreement drawn up before the Euro-Mediterranean conference which was
held in Barcelona on November 27/28.  It was also important in that
the EU sees partnership agreements with the countries of the Maghreb
as an essential contributor to stability on its southern flank.

The new fisheries agreement, which comes into effect on September 1,
1996, is for a non-renewable four years.  During this period Morocco
will modernize its fishing fleet, expand its structure and ports,
train seamen and prepare a scientific research program to manage its
fish resources.  For its part, the EU will provide financial aid to
fund these tasks and has undertaken to restructure its fleet and
gradually reduce its use of Moroccan territorial waters.  To this
end, the EU's financial contribution of Ecu102 million is to be
raised by 20-30%.

Over the period of the agreement, has agreed to cut its catch of
molluscs by 40% and of crustaceans by 34%.  The catch of other
species is also to be reduced.  At the same time, EU vessels are
obliged to land 30% of their catches in Moroccan ports.   Moroccan
waters on condition that there is a gradual reduction of the volume
of fishing over the coming four years at a rate of 40% for molluscs
and 34% for crustaceans and a percentage of the EU ships' cargoes are
unloaded at Moroccan ports.  EU fishermen have also committed
themselves to respecting the biological rest period to allow stocks
to recover and to employing one or more Moroccan sailors per vessel.

The partnership agreement provides improved access to the EU markets
for Morocco's agricultural produce and is a key element in the EU's
strategy to create a Euro-Med free trade zone by 2010.

MOROCCO
ECONOMY

Following a government report in September that economic growth will
slow, and that unemployment, the budget deficit and inflation will
climb if current policies are not changed, King Hassan announced in
October that Morocco is to introduce a series of five-year plans, the
first covering the period from 1995 until 2000.

Addressing the House of Representatives on the opening of the new
parliamentary term on October 13, the king said he had asked the
World Bank in June to carry out analyses of three areas of concern to
him:  education, administrative reforms and Morocco's future policy
on economic, financial and trade issues.  He said the World Bank's
reports on the first two subjects, which he had recently received,
had made "painful" reading.

On that basis, said the king, he had reached the conclusion that the
problems and the challenges are so great that they must be tackled
through a "full and comprehensive" national debate.  In particular,
the king pointed out that the year of drought had put enormous
pressure on the country and that it faced some difficult debt
repayment hurdles in 1997 and 1998.

The September report forecast that the drought will cut agricultural
output by around 56% this year, with a concomitant fall in the GDP of
4-5%.   As the 1995 budget had forecast a growth of 2.5%, it appears
that the country will suffer a negative growth in real terms.

Foreign Trade
The foreign trade turnover increased by 3.4% in the first six months
of 1995. Exports totaled Md53,886 million in the period, compared
Md52,113 million in the same period of 1994.

The export of food products increased by 14.1% to Md5,367 million,
from Md4,703 million in the same period of 1994.  Exports of energy
products rose from Md13,000 million in 1994 to Md14,326 million,
while phosphate exports increased by 14%, or Md94 million, to Md769
million from Md675 million in 1994.

Overall, imports declined.  However, there was a sharp 8.1% increase
in the import of food products, mainly cereals, as a result of the
drought.  The trade deficit in the period was reduced by 6.9% to
Md15,889 million.

SAUDI ARABIA
POLITICS

Concerns about the health of 74-year old King Fahd rose again when he
was admitted to the King Faysal specialist hospital in Riyadh on
November 29.  Official statements said that he entered hospital for a
routine medical check up and that he is fit and well.  However, King
Fahd is beleived to be terminally ill with advanced kidney failure.
As a result, he frequently loses consciousness and has to receive
blood transfusions to compensate for the occasional heavy bleeding
resulting from his condition.

Under those circumtances, it is not surprising that the rumor flew
around the Middle East that the king had actually suffered a minor
stroke.  The idea that the visit was indeed more than routine was
given further credence by the flurry of goodwill and get well
messages from other Arab leaders.  After all, if he hadn't been ill,
what was the point?

Terrorism
But while concerns over the health of the king have been around for
some time now, concerns over terrorist activity in the kingdom have
not.  That nonchalance was rapidly expelled in October and November
when first a mosque and then the a US military installation were
bombed.

No organization has claimed responsibility for the first attack, on a
mosque in Quba in the Bishah region in late October.  From the scant
details available, it appears a Saudi threw a bomb into the mosque
while people were at prayer. Six people were killed and 101 injured
in the explosion.  The bomber escaped the scene but was hunted down
and cornered in a mountainous area in the province of Namas.  There
was apparently an exchange of gunfire in which one policeman was
killed.  The man then blew himself up.

There is, as yet, no evidence to connect this to the second incident
on November 13 when a car bomb was detonated outside a US military
communications center in the capital Riyadh.  Six people were killed
and over 60 injured.   Part of the three-story building collapsed and
buildings were damaged up to half a kilometer away.  The bombers
escaped without detection.

A few days later, the government denied that there had also been
unsuccessful attempts to blow up the offices of the Defense Ministry
and the Petromin (General Petroleum and Minerals Organization).

The bombing in Riyadh, in particular, is a serious warning that even
a state as rigidly controlled as Saudi Arabia is not immune to the
forces of militant Islam that are wreaking such havoc elsewhere in
the Middle East and appears to be in line with a growing radicalism
in the kingdom.  First came the establishment and subsequent crushing
of the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR) in May
1993 and the roundup of hundreds of clerics and dissident academics
in the north-western province of Qasim last year.  This year,
leaflets have been circulated in Riyadh warning foreigners to desist
from involving themselves in Saudi affairs.

It appears that general dissatisfactions, domestically because of the
two-year recession, and abroad because of what is seen by the public
as the poor deal meted out to the Palestinians in the peace agreement
with Israel, have coalesced into an opposition to the presence in the
kingdom of not only foreign, but non-Arab and non-Muslim forces.
There is another problem.  At least 5,000 Saudi youths received
combat training in Afghanistan.  Some estimate the number could be as
high as 10,000.  The presence of such a large number of experienced
fundamentalist fighters outside of the government's control.  The
three groups that have claimed responsibility for the Riyadh bombing
have almost certainly been drawn from their ranks.

According to Dr Muhammad al-Mas'ari, the official spokesman of the
exiled CDLR, now based in London, England, these groups have carried
out no actions up to now because they could not obtain a fatwa to
carry out an armed attack on foreign forces in the kingdom.  The
basis they used to request such a fatwa is a religious ruling which
stipulates that no non-Islamic force, armed or not, should be present
in the Arabian Peninsula.  This ruling applies to the whole Islamic
world and precludes Muslims everywhere from seeking help from
non-Muslims in the Arabian peninsula.

However, requests for a fatwa have been consistently rejected by such
distinguished clerics and leaders such as Safar al-Hawali, Salman
al-Awdah and others.  The presumption by many is that a fatwa has now
been secured from a leading cleric outside of the kingdom.

The organizations that have claimed responsibility for the bombing
are the Tigers of the Gulf, the Partisans of God, , and the Jihad
Wing of the Islamic Movement for Change.  Only the last of these
groups is known.   However all previous statements from the Jihad
Wing, demanding that all foreign forces leave the Arabian peninsula,
have been made in writing.  All of the claims of responsibility for
the Riyadh bombing have been made by telephone.

Although the attack automatically increases the political terrorism
threat component in our assessment of Saudi Arabia's political risk,
we do not see the threat as great on current evidence.

Finally, and to the intense embarrassment of all concerned, it became
known in November that the US security forces had arrested one of its
servicemen, a Lt-Col Michael Schwart, in September on suspicion of
spying for Saudi Arabia.  Schwart was serving in the US naval
intelligence base in Riyadh when he was arrested.

However, Schwart has not been charged with espionage and betraying
his country.  This treatment stands in sharp contrast to that of
another US citizen, Jonathan Pollard, who has spent 10 years in jail
for spying for Israel.  In recognition of his work, the Israeli
government granted Pollard Israeli citizenship in late November.

Government Changes
After only three months in the job, Dr. Sulaymani Bin Abd al-Aziz
al-Salim resigned as finance and national economy minister on October
9.  The official reason given for his sudden departure is the state
of his health.  Given that he has a history of heart trouble and has
been treated for the same in London, there is no obvious reason to
presume ulterior reasons.

He was replaced on the same day by Dr Abd al-Aziz bin Abdullah
al-Khuwaytir.  Al-Khuwaytir had been education minister since 1975,
but was appointed minister without portfolio in the August reshuffle
that put Al-Salim into finance.

There are considerable differences between the two men.  Al-Salim
could be regarded as a technocrat, despite his long experience in
government (he had been commerce minister for 20 years before his
appointment to finance).  Despite this long service, Al-Salim is
still only 54 years old and is held in high regard in the USA as well
as Saudi Arabia.

Al-Khuwaytir, on the other hand is considerably older at 68 and much
more of an insider, being much more of a trusted retainer to the king
than just a minister.  Thus while Al-Salim's appointment could be
seen as a signal that King Fahd had finally decided to allow decisive
new action to be taken in the management of the economy, his
replacement gives the impression of a "steady-as-she-goes" approach,
with little prospect of fundamental change.

This difference between the two men is so stark that most
commentators believe that Al-Khuwaytir's appointment is only
temporary and that he will soon be replaced by another, younger
financial or economic technician.  The top names currently touted are
Hamad Al-Sayari, the 54-year old governor of the Saudi central bank
and Ahmad Abdul Latif, the 60-year old president of the Arab Banking
Corporation.

However, there is always the possibility that Al-Salim's resignation
had more to do with the way he was running his portfolio than his
health, and that King Fahd did not like the proposed changes of
direction.  If that is the case, then the appointment of
Al-Khuwaytir, who can be relied on to have much the same mind set as
the king, could be a great deal more permanent than is presumed.  It
would also indicate that reforms, if any, will be conducted at a much
slower pace.

SAUDI ARABIA
ECONOMY

An indicator that King Fahd may be backtracking on his commitment to
reform is the government's claim in November that it has now managed
to overcome its financial difficulties and that these were anyway
exaggerated by the foreign media.

In particular, the government statement claimed that the financial
deficit in the first half of 1995 had been reduced to 2% of GDP,
compared with a deficit of about 9% in 1994.  The deficit in the
foreign current account in the period was also reduced to 2% of GDP,
from 8% in 1994.

The problem is that this improvement is almost entirely due to the
strengthening of international oil prices last year.  The reform
process began last year with an austerity budget designed to cut
spending by 6% to US$40 billion in order to pull the budget deficit
down to US$4 billion.  This compares with deficits of US$37.62
billion in 1991, US$-11.13 billion in 1992, US$9.53 billion in 1993,
and US$10.68 billion in 1994.

However, the oil revenue projections in the budget were based on an
oil price of only US$14/bbl.  However, oil prices averaged
US$15.50/bbl through most of last year.  This extra income, probably
somewhere in excess of US$3 billion, has been the major contributor
to the country's improved financial situation.

However, the real imbalances in the economy, such as the growing
unemployment among the educated young, the sharp rise in inflation
(up to 6% from 1-2%), and government payment arrears of US$405
billion, are still there.  Complacency now could be disastrous.

YEMEN
POLITICS

Although there has been a significant improvement n the overall
security situation since the civil war, crimes against property are
rife, particularly in Aden.  There is also a good deal of fraud being
perpetrated over land contracts.

There has also been some attempted terrorism of late.  A group of
what the government called "sabotage elements" were arrested at the
end of September in Aden and another group in mid-November.  They are
not believed to be related to the militant Islamic groups in Egypt,
but to the defeated Yemeni Socialist Party, whose leadership was
forced to flee the country after its defeat in the civil war in 1994.

The government admits that yet other groups could still be at large
and the possibility of at least isolated acts of terrorism cannot be
discounted.  In an effort to reduce the risk, the government has
deported some 4,000 Algerian, Libyan, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals
in October and November.  According to Prime Minister al-Ghani, the
aim of the deportation program was to prevent Aden being used as a
base for terrorist activities against its neighbors.  Particular
effort has been made to locate and detain any Egyptian nationals
believed to be conspiring against the Egyptian state.

A new minister for expatriate affairs, Fadl Muhammad bin Aydarut
al-Afifi, was appointed on November 11.

Foreign Relations
The rapprochement with Saudi Arabia appears to be continuing
according to plan.  The third Saudi-Yemeni joint committee for border
demarcation held its third session in San'a during November 5-9 in a
reportedly friendly and cooperative atmosphere.  Agreement was
reached to start implementing the time table of the technical field
work of border demarcation.  The fourth session is due to begin on
December 25.

Although relations with Saudi Arabia are clearly on an improving
track, relations with Kuwait remain sticky.  Deputy prime minister
and foreign minister Abnd al-Karim al-Iryani went some way towards
allaying Kuwaiti concerns in late October when he said that Yemen had
never adopted a policy supporting or entrenching the occupation of
Kuwait and that claims to the contrary were a falsification of
Yemen's position.

However, the effect of this was rather spoilt when Yemen later
supported the call by the United Arab Emirates for the UN sanctions
against Iraq to be lifted.

Eritrea
Yemen has also managed to blunder into a territorial dispute with
Eritrea over three Red Sea islands - Hunaysh al-Kubra, Zukar and
Hunaysh al-Sughrah.  The islands have been occupied by Yemen, which
is hoping to develop them as tourist centers.

In mid-November Eritrean naval patrols attempted to land on one of
the islands when it appeared that tourists facilities were under
construction there.  Yemeni military units on the island prevented
the Eritreans from landing.  In response Eritrea warned Yemeni
military units and fishermen to evacuate the island on the basis that
it is disputed territory.

In an effort to cool the situation the two sides have agreed to a
series of talks on the status of the islands.  The first of these
meetings took place in San'a on November 22.

YEMEN
ECONOMY

This year is to be the first in a new five-year plan extending to the
year 2000 aimed at establishing the primary development projects in
order to provide a base for the future development of the economy.
The government says the plan will be carried out in line with the
commitments it has already made to maintain its economic reform
programs, combat financial and administrative corruption, improve
production, and encourage investment, exports, trade exchange and
competition.  Apart from oil and gas developments, particular
attention is to be paid to agriculture, tourism and fishery
resources.

The key to Yemen's future economic development is oil and gas.  In
this respect, a major step forward was achieved in September with the
signing of the final agreement on a project to liquefy and export
natural gas with the French company Total.  Negotiations are under
way with the US companies Hunt and Exxon with the aim of having them
participate in the project as well.  South Korea has already put
itself forward as a potential buyer of Yemeni gas.

Overall, the US$3 billion project is forecast to produce five million
tonnes of natural gas a year for 25 years.  This will produce an
annual revenues of about US$600, the bulk of which will be earmarked
to boost agricultural and industrial development, and improve
services.

Another major project is the development and modernization of the
Aden refinery.  Bids for the work have been tendered by foreign
companies and are currently being studied.  The project should get
underway this year.

Currently, oil production is concentrated in two areas - Sector No.
18 in Ma'rib and Jawf and Sector No. 14 in the Masilah area in
Hadhramawt Governorate - which jointly produce about 350,000 barrels
per day (b/d).  Crude oil production from these fields is expected to
increase this year due to the continued drilling of development wells
and to the coming on stream of new fields in the Jannah area, known
as Sector No. 5.  This should add around 25,000 b/d to next year's
output total.  Also due to come into operation soon are the Farid and
Atud fields in the eastern part of Shabwah, known as Sector No. 10.
Initial production from these fields is expected to be 12,000 b/d.

Overall, some 26 international companies are carrying out surveys or
exploratory drilling operations in the country and the potential for
further major discoveries appears high.  Total has already been
discovered oil in commercial quantities at Qaribah and Hisn
al-Karadis in eastern Shabwah.  On that basis the government is
expecting to increase its overall oil production by up to 60,000 b/d
this year.  Following the completion of oil pipeline projects, output
should rise to 500,000 b/d.  Natural gas output is expected to reach
six million tonnes a year and should be able to be increased to seven
million tonnes.
