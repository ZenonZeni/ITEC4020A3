<H2>Impact of Efficiency Standards in the U.S.</H2>
<H3>Single
Product Savings: the Case of Refrigerators</H3>

<P>Some of the most
dramatic savings due to standards have come in refrigerators and
freezers.  In the U.S. refrigerator energy consumption has come down
from an average value of over 1700 kWh/a in 1972 to roughly 650 kWh/a in
1995.  State and federal efficiency standards have played a major role
in realizing these savings.  The figure below illustrates the degree of
energy savings attributable to U.S. efficiency standards for
refrigerators and freezers.  In 1990 a first round of standards went
into effect which will save a total of 16.3 TWh by 2015 over the
projected frozen efficiency baseline.  A 1993 update boosts savings
another 34 TWh over the same period.</P>

<H3>National Savings in the United States</H3>
<B>Cumulative energy
savings under existing and proposed standards will include:</B>
<UL>
<LI>An estimated 47 EJ under existing standards (1990-2015), equivalent
to 1.4 years of current U.S. residential energy use.
</LI> 
</UL><B>Appliance and lighting standards are also economically
beneficial:</B>
<UL>
<LI>The national economy benefits by roughly $1000 for every federal
dollar spent on appliance standards.
</LI>
<LI>Consumer benefits exceed costs by, on average, 3.2 to 1.
</LI>
<LI>For residential appliances, the net present value (the net gains to
consumers after subtracting the costs of new, more efficient appliances
from total energy savings) is $53.6 billion for the period 1995-2015 (in
$1990, discounted @ 7% real).
</LI>
<LI>For lamps, the net present value is $56 billion for the period
1996-2030 (EPAct standards only, in $1990, discounted @ 7% real).
</LI>
<LI>Redirected consumer spending will create a net 36-64 thousand jobs
by the year 2000.
</LI> 
</UL><B>Finally, appliance and lighting standards will reap
environmental benefits:</B>
<UL>
<LI>An estimated 250 million tons of CO2 will be averted in 2015 under
existing standards.  
</LI>
<LI>An estimated 500 thousand tons of NOx will be averted in 2015 under
existing standards. 
</LI>
<LI>Up to 550 thousand tons of SO2 will be made available for tade or
banking under the provisions of the 1992 Clean Air Act.
</LI>
