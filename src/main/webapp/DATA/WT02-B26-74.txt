<H2>Green Bay Packer Defends Persons with Brain Disorders</H2>
 <HR>


	On December 1, 1995, Lionel Aldridge encouraged individuals with brain disorders (mental illnesses) to join the workforce during a job fair held in Washington, D.C.   After his successes as a defensive end in two Super Bowls for Vince Lombardi's legendary Green Bay Packers, Mr. Aldridge suffered schizophrenia and was homeless for two-and-a-half years.  Through sharing his personal experience, Mr. Aldridge inspired others to follow their dreams.  His advice: "Don't let others determine who you are or who you can be."
<P>	Close to two hundred individuals attended the Washington, D.C., Mental Health Consumer League's event, entitled "Yes We Can: Job Opportunities For Mental Health Consumers." 
<P>	"Having Lionel Aldridge speak at the job fair was the highlight of the participants' day.  He is a role model who has experienced the same challenges that face persons with brain disorders," commented Regina Duvall, co-coordinator of the job fair and NAMI member.  "Lionel's most important message was that even though you have a mental illness, you should not allow yourself to feel less of a person.  His self-esteem is both courageous and contagious."
