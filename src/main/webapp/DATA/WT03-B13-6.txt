UK'S CHRISTMAS DIP DOES NOT MEAN REAL CELLULAR SLUMP, SAYS INDUSTRY

The disappointing figures for new UK cellular connections recorded over
the run-up to Christmas do not reflect a real slump in demand for
cellular services in the UK, according to leading figures in the
industry.

They argue that while the total of 222,900 net connections made last
month represents a 25-per-cent decline on the record-breaking 300,000
figure achieved in December 1994, this does not mean that there has
been a significant tailing off in consumer interest.

They point out that the December decline has disguised the fact that
connections for the year as a whole were much higher than they were in
1994.  The UK's four network operators added a total of 1,886,009
customers in January to December 1995 -- a 22-per-cent increase over the
1,544,033 added in the previous year.  But in 1995 the demand was
spread out more evenly.

The aggressive competition between dealers, retailers and off-the-page
companies during 1995 soaked up much of the demand for cellular
telephones in advance of December.  ``In 1995, it was a sale every
month,'' said Nigel Salomon, marketing director of service provider
Securicor Cellular Services, ``how much more could happen at
Christmas?''

Executives say that many of the telephones bought in December 1994 were
gift purchases which led to disconnection when their new owners
received their first bills.  They hope this December's new customers
will ``churn less but make more calls,'' according to David Savage,
chairman of service provider Astec Communications.

Who's number one? Vodafone's market leadership is under pressure from
its nearest rival Cellnet, which by the start of this month had only
33,009 fewer subscribers.

On January 1, Vodafone had a total of 2,333,009 subscribers compared to
Cellnet's figure of 2,300,000.  Cellnet has been gradually eroding its
rival's lead.  December was the sixth consecutive month in which it
connected more net new customers than Vodafone.  In December it gained
89,100 net new customers compared to Vodafone's 53,800.

Vodafone faced a major challenge from Cellnet this time last year but
responded aggressively to see off the challenge.  It will be hoping
that last week's launch by service providers of its restructured GSM
tariffs will have a similar effect this year (Mobile Communications,
185/1).

Cellnet is thought unlikely to respond immediately to Vodafone's new
package of per-second billing and ``bundled'' tariffs, which are
similar to the existing packages offered by Orange.  Bundled tariffs
offer customers a certain number of calls as part of their monthly
subscription charge.  Cellnet has tested such tariffs but does not
appear close to a launch.

Cellnet last month withdrew its under-performing Frequent Caller Plus
Budget Plan, the bundled GSM-only tariff for business users which has
not proved popular.  The tariff will no longer be offered, although
existing subscribers can stay on it.  It offered a monthly subscription
charge of #45 in return for either 100 minutes of calls at peak rate or
200 minutes at off peak, or a combination of the two.

Orange's dream Christmas: Although Cellnet is Vodafone's main rival in
terms of total subscribers, one of the main reasons for the slowdown in
its performance is the competition it faces from smaller rival Orange.
Orange is focusing on the business market, which is much more important
to Vodafone than it is to Cellnet.  In December, Orange made 50,000 net
new connections, making this the third month in a row that it has
pushed Vodafone close on new connections (Mobile Communications,
183/7).

Orange now has 380,000 subscribers and is close to overtaking its
nearest rival, Mercury One-2-One.  This company, which signed up 30,000
subscribers in December, now has 397,000 subscribers.

Overall, Vodafone trailed Cellnet on total connections over the 1995
calendar year, with 695,009 against 740,000.  It also lost out to its
rival in 1994, making 585,911 connections compared to Cellnet's
664,122.

Last year, Orange and One-2-One added 280,000 and 171,000 net new
subscribers respectively.  This compares with figures of 100,000 and
194,000 respectively in 1994, reflecting a considerable advance by
Orange but a disastrous slump for One-2-One.

Third quarter: Vodafone lost out particularly badly in the most recent
quarter, October-December, when it connected 143,000 net new
connections -- well down on the predictions of industry analysts --
against Cellnet's 215,000.  These compare with figures of 186,000 and
281,200 respectively in 1994.

Cellnet, however, showed a significant increase in churn in the last
quarter of 1995 compared with the same period last year -- although its
net figures were down on 1994 its gross connections were up over the
previous year, 379,500 compared to 369,500.  Vodafone's churn also
increased.  Gross connections for the last three months of 1995 were
286,000 compared to 313,000 last year.

SPAIN FOLLOWS ITALIAN MODEL IN CELLULAR COMPENSATION PLANS

The Spanish government has drawn up a series of proposed measures
designed to compensate Airtel, the country's second GSM digital
cellular operator, for the Pta85 million ($702 million) fee it had to
pay to secure its licence.

The government, which is understood to have finished putting together
draft proposals on December 28, is currently working with Airtel to
produce a final version of the plan.  The two sides expect to reach an
agreement by the end of next month, if not before.

This rate of progress so far appears to have been acceptable to the
European Commission, which had originally told the Spanish government
to come up with a compensation plan by the end of December (Mobile
Communications, 183/1).

The Italian government, which was set a similar timetable by the EC, is
one step ahead.  It has already completed its package of similar
measures to compensate Italy's second GSM digital cellular operator,
Omnitel, for its L750 billion ($475 million) licence fee.  This
package, which was announced on December 22, was worked out in
agreement with the EC and is expected to receive its formal approval at
the end of this month.

The two governments would have faced legal proceedings before the
European Court of Justice if they had failed to comply with the EC's
demands.

Spanish plan: The Spanish proposals centre on three core measures:
reducing by up to 50 per cent the interconnection rates that Airtel has
to pay to use the network of the state-controlled Telefonica; allowing
Airtel to build its own infrastructure or to use alternative infrastr-
ucture; and awarding Airtel a concession to build and operate a
personal communications network (PCN) based on the DCS-1800 standard.
The first two measures are based on suggestions put forward by Airtel
itself last summer (Mobile Communications, 176/3).

The proposals have been drafted under the aegis of Rienaldo Rodriguez,
the director general of the communications branch of the ministry of
transport and communications, who was appointed to the task at the
beginning of November.

At the moment it is unclear whether the Spanish government intends to
adopt a mixture of all three measures, although this is considered
highly likely given that the Italian government's EC-sanctioned package
is based on a combination of almost identical elements.

Airtel -- which is owned by Airtouch of the USA (15.8 per cent), BT (6.3
per cent) and a group of leading Spanish banks, utilities and
construction groups, and which  launched commercial services on October
3 (Mobile Communications, 179/1) -- had connected 8,000 subscribers by
December 1, and 15,000 by the start of this month.  Telefonica Moviles,
the cellular arm of Telefonica which was charged no fee for its GSM
licence, launched its digital service in July, and had connected 23,000
customers by December 1 and 37,000 by January 1.

The EC told the Spanish government last July that it would have to come
up with measures to enable Airtel to compete on an equal basis with
Telefonica Moviles.  It placed a similar requirement on the Italian
government in respect of Omnitel and its state-controlled counterpart
Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM).

The EC considers the imposition of steep licence fees on new entrants
to the market to be potentially discriminatory if the incumbents do not
have to pay fees for the licences they already hold.  It says that in
order to rectify the situation, the governments concerned should either
extract a licence fee from the incumbent cellular operators, or
introduce measures that will compensate the new entrant for the money
it has already paid.

Italian package: The Italian package, which was announced by
telecommunications minister Agostino Gambino, provides for Omnitel's
interconnection fees to be reduced by 25 per cent this year and by the
same amount next year, which is expected to produce savings in the
region of L60 billion over the two-year period.  The first reduction in
interconnection fees took effect on January 1.

Omnitel will also be granted a licence to offer PCN services based on
the DSC-1800 standard, and will be allowed to use alternative
infrastructure as soon as legislation is in place to enable this.

Omnitel says it is ``happy'' with the compensation package, a reaction
that has surprised several analysts who do not consider it a
particularly good deal.  Telecommunications analysts with merchant bank
Robert Fleming Securities note that the L60 billion savings from
reduced interconnection fees hardly match the L750 billion that Omnitel
paid for its GSM licence in March 1994 (Mobile Communications, 146/3).

In respect of allowing Omnitel to use alternative infrastructure,
analysts point out that this is allowing Omnitel no more than the
freedom to which it would be entitled anyway, given that the Italian
government says it wants to liberalise alternative infrastructure this
year in line with the timetable being pushed through by the EC (Telecom
Markets, 277/1).

The Italian government has already stated its intention to award
licences for PCN services by the middle of this year (Mobile
Communications, 181/1).  But when Gambino announced the plans in
October there was no indication that a licence would automatically be
awarded to Omnitel.  At the time it was said that one licence would be
automatically granted to TIM and a second put out to competitive
tender.

Under the new deal, Omnitel will not be allowed to offer commercial PCN
services until 1998, and neither TIM nor any other competitor will be
allowed to start PCN services before Omnitel has done so.  This puts
back the start of PCN by about a year.  Last October, Gambino intimated
that services would start on January 1 1997.

Omnitel -- whose major shareholders include Olivetti (41.3 per cent),
Airtouch (11.7 per cent) and Bell Atlantic (11.6 per cent), and which
started commercial services on December 7 (Mobile Communications,
184/6) -- says that by January 7 it had signed about 50,000 subscribers.
 TIM had 417,855 GSM subscribers on January 1, and says that on
December 22 alone it signed 23,633 new digital subscribers.

Omnitel is now is the process of expanding its Spazio Omnitel retail
stores.  The first four were opened on December 15 in Milan, Florence,
Genoa and Brescia.  A further 20 stores are scheduled to be opened
throughout Italy by the end of this year, many through franchising
agreements.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION'S MOBILE DIRECTIVE IS FINALLY ADOPTED

The European Commission yesterday (January 10) adopted the Article 90
directive to liberalise mobile services and networks (Mobile
Communications, 184/3).  A political decision had already been taken on
December 20 but formal adoption was delayed by translation
difficulties.

The directive will come into force before the end of February.  Once it
comes into force, the member states will be given nine months in which
to notify the Commission of the appropriate national measures taken to
implement the provisions.

The directive requires member states to abolish all exclusive and
special rights in the mobile communications market and, wherever this
has not yet been achieved, to establish open and fair licensing
procedures to authorise the launch of GSM, DCS-1800 and Digital
European Cordless Telecommunications (Dect) standard services.  The
number of licences should only be limited by `essential requirements'
such as spectrum efficiency.

Restrictions on current licensees will also have to be raised to allow
them to extend their services from one frequency into another.

In particular, the entering into force of the directive will mean that
member states will not be able to refuse to allocate licences for
public access or telepoint applications for systems operating on the
basis of the Dect standard.

Similarly, member states will not be able to restrict the combination
of mobile technologies, in particular where multistandard equipment is
available.

Nor will member states be able to refuse to allocate DCS-1800 licences
to either new operators or existing GSM operators.  But this aspect of
the directive will not come into effect until January 1 1998.  The
delay is being granted in order to give member states the option of
allowing new DCS-1800 operators time to establish themselves before
existing GSM operators jump in.

Operators will also have the right to provide their own infrastructure
and to make use of alternative infrastructure provided by third parties
such as utility companies.  The Commission believes this to be
particularly important as it estimates that the cost of leasing
transmission capacity currently accounts for between 30 per cent and 50
per cent of the revenues of a second operator.

Member states with less developed networks -- Portugal, Greece, Spain
and Ireland -- will be able to apply for derogations of the directive
for up to five years.  Luxembourg has already made it clear that it is
not interested in any derogation.

Alternative networks: The Article 90 directive to open up alternative
networks and establish full competition is currently being examined by
various working groups and is likely to be adopted in February (Mobile
Communications, 184/3).

OLIVETTI SHARE ISSUE FULLY SUBSCRIBED

Olivetti says that last month's L2,257 billion ($1.42 billion) share
issue, which closed on December 15, was almost fully subscribed with
99.8 per cent of the offer taken up.  It intends to invest a
significant proportion of the money in Omnitel.

LUXEMBOURG GETS SET TO AWARD SECOND GSM CELLULAR LICENCE

The Luxembourg ministry of communications this week invited potential
bidders to register initial expressions of interest in the country's
second GSM digital cellular telephone licence, which is to be awarded
later this year.  It says that eight or nine parties have already come
forward.

The ministry will not reveal who the parties are.  But the Luxembourg-
based Millicom International Cellular confirms that it has expressed an
interest in the licence while Airtouch of the USA says it is
considering doing so.

Interested parties will eventually be asked to put forward proposals
for an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 service.  But the ministry says that it
will award an integrated licence only if it receives a submission which
is sufficiently convincing.  Otherwise the licence will be GSM-only.

However, the ministry will not be able to issue a tender, let alone
grant the second GSM licence, until parliament has agreed to end the
monopoly of cellular services that is currently enjoyed by the state-
owned P&T, which is already operating a GSM network alongside an older
NMT-450 analogue network.

The cellular monopoly will be broken through enacting a new
telecommunications law which is intended to liberalise the country's
extremely closed market in advance of the European Union deadline of
allowing full competition by January 1 1998.

The new telecommunications law will among other things create an
independent regulatory authority.  However, the ministry of
communications says it has no immediate plans to allow new operators
into any sector other than digital cellular.

The government expects to present the new legislation to parliament
this spring, and is confident the bill will be passed by the summer.
At this point it will be able to issue an official licence tender,
leading to the award of two GSM licences later in the year.  One will
automatically be given to the P&T, while the other will be awarded on a
competitive basis.

The P&T will be eligible for an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 licence.  But
like the bidders for the second licence, it will have to put forward
proposals to justify this.  Otherwise it will get a GSM-only licence.

The ministry has not yet revealed detailed licence terms, but it did
give a broad overview of certain elements when it announced its licence
plans towards the end of last month.  The process will involve the
payment of a competitive licence fee, although the ministry stresses
that this will be just one aspect of the selection procedure and that
it will not be running an auction.  Other important elements will
include the speed of each bidder's proposed network roll-out and the
nature of its tariff proposition.

The P&T will have to pay a licence fee to match the one paid by the new
entrant.  If both operators get the same type of licence, the fees will
be the same.  If one gets a GSM licence, and the other gets a GSM/DCS-
1800 licence, then the P&T fee would be adjusted appropriately.

The ministry is considering an integrated GSM/DCS-1800 service because
Luxembourg, with a population of 390,000, is too small a market to
support two GSM networks and two DCS-1800 networks as well.

The P&T's GSM network, which was launched in July 1993, had about
27,500 subscribers by the start of this month.  The NMT-450 system,
which was launched in 1983 and has been in decline for some time, had
about 160.

The only private involvement in the cellular market at the moment is
through four service providers, which sell GSM services but not
analogue ones.  One of these, Mobilux, is equally owned by the P&T and
by MIC.  The other three -- CMD, LTM and Satcom -- are wholly private.

WEST EUROPEAN MARKET HITS NOVEMBER SLOWDOWN

November proved to be a disappointing month for the west European
cellular industry, with a relatively slow rate of growth, according to
figures collected by Mobile Communications.

These show that the market added 769,721 net new subscribers during the
month, taking the total from 20,797,135 to 21,566,856, representing
growth of 3.56 per cent.  The end-month total is 63-per-cent higher
than the 13,231,421 reached at the end of November 1994.

The November growth figure compares with the October figure of 808,689
(4.05 per cent) and the September figure of 708,037 (3.67 per cent).

The equivalent growth figure for November 1994 was 494,680 (3.7 per
cent) (Mobile Communications, 162/5).

The figures would have been influenced by the slow rate of growth in
the UK -- Europe's largest cellular market.  In the UK the November
total of net new subscribers was 158,500, much the same as in November
1994 when 165,000 were added (Mobile Communications, 162/2).  The UK
growth rate for November was 3.15 per cent.

Not all UK operators are experiencing the same growth.  DCS-1800
operator Orange is adding almost as many customers as the much larger
Vodafone (Mobile Communications, 185/2).  Orange added 30,000 net new
customers in November (to take its total to 330,000) compared to 42,500
for Vodafone (to take its total to 2,279,209), 69,000 for Cellnet
(total 2,210,900), and 17,000 for Mercury One-2-One (total 367,000).

An increase in GSM handset prices in Norway following the end of a
``commission war'' has caused growth to slow to about 3.83 per cent,
well down on the spectacular growth rates over the summer (Mobile
Communications, 179/6).

The fastest growing markets in November were Ireland (9.36 per cent),
Luxembourg (7.17 per cent), Spain (6.05 per cent), the Netherlands
(5.48 per cent), Italy (4.69 per cent), Cyprus (4.40 per cent), France
(4.21 per cent), and Germany (4.08 per cent).

The Irish market has been particularly boosted by the growth of GSM
subscriptions.  The price of handsets has fallen substantially
following an increase in commission payments by Eircell, which is
preparing to face competition for the first time following the award of
a second GSM licence to Esat Digifone last October (Mobile
Communications, 182/1).  Increased coverage has also boosted the
attractiveness of GSM.

In Italy, Spain and the Netherlands the launch of new GSM services has
contributed to the growth of local GSM markets as well as stimulating
cellular markets as a whole.

INDIAN GOVERNMENT FINALLY AWARDS REGIONAL GSM LICENCES

The Indian government has finally issued cellular licences for all of
the 18 regional concessions where bids were placed, a process that was
thrown into disarray by the imposition in November of a cap on the
number of licences that any one operator could hold.

Several groups have not yet paid the first instalment of their licence
fees, which were due on December 18.  But the delays are understood to
be temporary and therefore not a cause for concern.

Groups that have yet to pay include Modicom for its Karnataka grade A
licence circle for which it offered Rs13,930 million ($393 million),
the third highest bid placed (see table).  The Modicom group has also
not yet paid the first instalment of its Punjab grade B licence circle,
which cost it Rs12,660 million.

All of the second-highest bidders have agreed to the government's
requirement that they match the fee placed by the highest bidders, as
set out in the initial tender process (Mobile Communications, 179/3).

Under the terms of the licence cap, a single operator can hold no more
than three licences in the grade A and B licence circles, which are the
most attractive.  But there is no limit on the number of licences it
can hold in the less attractive C circles (Mobile Communications,
183/4).

The only groups hit by the cap were the US West-BPL group and Modicom.
US West-BPL originally looked set to win five licences and Modicom four
licences, all in grade A and B circles (Mobile Communications, 177/1).

The operators were obliged, when decided which licence options to give
up, to retain those in circles where they had been the highest bidder.

Modicom originally bid the highest in Karnataka, Punjab, Rajasthan and
Utter Pradesh East.  So it had the choice of which of these licence
options it should give up.  It decided to relinquish its option on the
Rajasthan licence, which passed to Aircell Digilink, and to hold on to
the other three.

But it was forced to give up Utter Pradesh East because its net worth
did not meet the minimum holding limit set down by the Department of
Telecommunications for any operator wishing to hold more than two of
the top ranked licences.

US West-BPL bid the highest in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and the second
highest in Gujurat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.  So the group was
obliged to keep the first two, and then had the option of deciding
which of the second two to relinquish.  It chose to retain the licence
for Maharashtra (Mobile Communications, 185/16).

CZECH GSM LICENCE CONTEST ATTRACTS WIDE INTEREST

The competition for a 49-per-cent stake in one of the two GSM digital
cellular telephone licences that are being awarded in the Czech
Republic has attracted initial expressions of interest from a total of
18 companies (Mobile Communications, 180/1).

The list of companies which have put in requests for tender documents
and submitted contributions to the consultation process contains
several leading operators from Europe and North America and a number of
local companies.

The potential bidders include DeTeMobil, the McCaw International
company run by cellular billionaire Craig McCaw, Telesystem
International Wireless of Canada, TeleDanmark, France Telecom, RWE
Telliance, Skoda-Mannesmann, Southwestern Bell International, Telenor,
Telecom Finland, Stet International, AirTouch, Vebacom, Tokyo-based
communications company Domen, Czech energy distributor Czechkom Plus,
Czech energy generator CEZ, and two other Czech companies JITY and
Telekomunikace Montaze.

Many of the companies on the list are now involved in negotiations to
form consortia before the final deadline for applications at the
beginning of February.  TeleDanmark and Telenor have already announced
that they will be making a joint bid, with TeleDanmark taking the lead.

A government-appointed committee will evaluate the bids during February
and March.  Following the submission of its recommendations a final
government decision is expected to be made before the end of March.

The winner will become the junior partner to the state-controlled radio
infrastructure operator Ceske Radiokomunikace, which has already been
given a 51-per-cent stake in the new operating organisation that has
been awarded one of the GSM licences.

The other GSM licence has already been promised to the existing NMT-450
operator Eurotel -- which is owned by Czech telecommunications operator
SPT (51 per cent), US West (24.5 per cent) and Bell Atlantic (24.5 per
cent).  A 27-per-cent stake in SPT is held by a joint venture between
KPN of the Netherlands and Swiss PTT Telecom.

Bidding process: Any consortium bidding for the 49-per-cent stake
alongside Ceske Radiokomunikace will have to be controlled by a foreign
company because the government has specified that a leading role must
be played by a `qualified operator' with a minimum of 300,000 cellular
subscribers.

According to Vladimir Sedlacek, director of telecommunications policy
at the ministry of economics, the main criteria for choosing the
winning consortium to partner Ceske Radiokomunikace will be the ability
to deliver low tariffs, good coverage, quick roll-out and high levels
of investment.  The licence fee will be set low to reflect these
priorities, at about $12 million or $13 million.

POLISH GSM CONTEST LIMPS ON

Meanwhile, there has been a much less enthusiastic response to the
contest for two GSM licences in Poland, with only three consortia
submitting bids by the closing date of January 3.

One consortium contains Polish oil refiner Petrochemia Plock, copper
mining group KGHM Polska Miedz and the Polish Power Grid Company in
partnership with TeleDanmark and AirTouch.

Another includes Polish state-owned chemical company Ciech Warszawa,
together with smaller Polish partners alongside Stet.

The third is led by Polish trading company Elektrim together with other
smaller partners and US West.

The winning bidders are expected to be announced by the end of
February.

The number of contenders has been limited partly by the shortage of
sizeable Polish partners capable of taking the required 51-per-cent
domestic stake that a bidding consortium must have in order to qualify
for the contest (Mobile Communications, 180/9).  Another factor has
been the size of the licence fee, with bidders being asked to pay
Ecu100 million ($78.54 million) at the outset and additional annual
payments after that.

Bidders may also have been frightened off by the legal dispute between
the Polish government on the one hand, and France Telecom and Ameritech
on the other.  The two foreign operators, which partner the state-owned
telecommunications operator Telekomunikacja Polska (TP) in the
country's existing NMT-450 Centertel cellular operator, say that the
government has gone back on a promise to award Centertel one of the GSM
licences (see below).

One potential contender which did not submit a bid was the consortium
headed by Polish computer company Optimus and including Telecom
Finland, Veba Telecom, Kinnevik of Sweden and Millicom International
Cellular of Luxembourg.  This group collapsed just before Christmas
after the foreign partners pulled out, citing the high licence fee as
the reason.

CELLULAR LOSERS MOUNT LEGAL ACTION

This week France Telecom followed Ameritech in announcing that it would
take legal action against the Polish government for failing to honour a
1991 pledge to grant Centertel a GSM licence (Mobile Communications,
180/9).

Both operators have asked the International Court of Justice in the
Hague to set up arbitration proceedings.

France Telecom is seeking around $500 million in damages to compensate
it for investment in Centertel's infrastructure as well as the loss of
future earnings.

The Polish government is believed to have suggested to the Centertel
partners that it could instead offer them the DCS-1800 licence it is
planning to award towards the end of 1996.  However, the decision of
the two foreign operators to initiate legal action suggests that
neither was impressed by this proposal.

THIRD GSM OPERATOR FOR ESTONIA

A third GSM licence was awarded in Estonia on December 18 to the
Ritabell joint venture between Millicom International Cellular (48 per
cent) and Estonian media company Levicom (52 per cent).  Luxembourg-
based Millicom International Cellular has management control over the
joint venture.  The new service will be launched in the second half of
1996.

There are already three networks in Estonia, run by two operators.
Semi-state-owned Eesti Mobiiltelefon -- which is a consortium of Eesti
Telecom, Telia and Telecom Finland -- runs an NMT-450 network (launched
in 1991) and a GSM network (launched in 1993).  Radiolinja Estonia runs
a GSM network (launched January 1995).  At the beginning of October,
Estonia had a total of 25,400 cellular subscribers and a penetration
rate of 1.6 per cent (Mobile Communications, 183/5).

Millicom says that Estonia may be a small country but that it is
showing a lively rate of growth and is capable of supporting a third
GSM operator.  It suggests that a GSM network in the region may require
only 10,000 to 15,000 subscribers to be viable.

FCC STAGES BILLION-DOLLAR PCS FREQUENCY AUCTION

The second Federal Communications Commission auction of Personal
Communications Services (PCS) radio frequencies in the USA had
attracted top bids totalling $1.38 billion by the end of last week.

The largest single bid of $225 million was submitted by North Coast
Mobile Communications for the New York licence area, the largest on
offer covering a potential 18 million users.

The highest total bids came from PersonalConnect Communications, the
venture backed by cellular billionaire Craig McCaw, with offers
totalling $278 million in five licence areas.

In this `C' block auction, which is aimed at entrepreneurs rather than
major telecom-munications players, the country is divided into a total
of 493 licence areas, known as Basic Trading Areas (BTAs).  The winner
in each BTA, roughly the size of a US county, will receive 30 MHz of
radio frequencies.

Last year, the FCC sold off 30 MHz of radio frequencies in its `A' and
`B' block auction but in far larger licence areas known as Major
Trading Areas (MTAs).  This auction, which attracted bids from the
industry's major players and lasted three-and-a-half months, raised a
total of $7.73 billion (Mobile Communications, 168/8).

The C block auction, which started in December and will probably run
for at least another month, started with 293 companies and still has
255 on board.  When it is finished, the FCC will decide when to sell
off the smaller D, E and F frequency blocks of 10 MHz each.

LATIVIAN AUTHORITIES TO SELECT WINNER OF GSM LICENCE

Latvia: Meanwhile, the Latvian authorities are due at the end of this
month to select the winner of the contest for a second GSM licence.  A
decision had been expected at the end of 1995.  There are five
applicants for the licence, including consortia led by Millicom
International Cellular, Motorola and Radiolinja of Finland.

The only operator in Latvia at present is Lat Mobilais Telefons -- a
joint venture between Telia, Telecom Finland and three Latvian
companies -- with a NMT-450 network launched in 1991 and a GSM network
launched in January 1995.

CANADIAN GOVERNMENT PLAYS SAFE WITH PCS LICENCES

The Canadian government awarded four national personal communications
service (PCS) licences on December 18 (Mobile Communications, 181/6).

Two national 30 MHz licences were awarded to Clearnet PCS and Microcell
Network and two national 10 MHz licences to the two existing cellular
operators, Rogers Cantel Mobile and Mobility Personacom Canada (which
has actually been given 12 regional licences to be held by the
affiliates which own it).

Industry Canada, the federal department for industrial affairs, had the
option of awarding up to six national licences in total and was widely
expected to do so.  Its decision to award only four leaves two national
blocks of frequency unallocated -- one of 30 MHz and one of 10 MHz.  No
official explanation has yet been given for the decision.  But Industry
Canada is due to publish a report later this month outlining its
reasons and also giving details of the licence conditions and the
spectrum transition policy which have not yet been released.

The Industry Canada decisions also represent a more mainstream approach
than expected.  During the contest, the department had stressed that it
wished to encourage innovation and competition as priorities, and that
it was willing to consider dividing up the frequency blocks on a
regional basis (Mobile Communications, 174/3).  But it is believed to
have been disappointed by the lack of new ideas exhibited in the
submissions.  These tended to be fairly similar, retaining a strong
high-mobility voice-telephony emphasis.  As none of the outsiders
distinguished themselves sufficiently technologically, the licences
ended up going to the safe options.

Clearnet PCS and Microcell Network were generally held to be two of the
three main candidates for national 30 MHz licences (Mobile
Communications, 181/6). The third favourite, TeleZone, a telepoint
licensee in which Bell Atlantic and AirTouch are strategic investors,
received nothing.  It has already announced that as a result it will be
laying off half of its staff.  It is believed that the company is
considering an appeal and may close down completely if it does not
obtain a licence.  Industry Canada says that there is no formal appeal
process, but that it is always possible to make representations.

Commentators suggest that TeleZone did not win a licence because it did
not provide a sufficiently regional focus to its application.

Clearnet PCS is a Canadian operator of enhanced specialised mobile
radio (ESMR) services in which substantial stakes are held by Motorola
and US ESMR operator Nextel.  Clearnet has still to make a technology
choice.  It has been trialling Nortel's GSM-based PCS technology and
Motorola's Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology in Ontario.

Microcell Network is a telepoint licensee (Mobile Communications,
163/6) with shareholders including National Telesystem (which has a
controlling stake in international operator Teleglobe), Sprint Canada,
CUC Broadcasting and others.  Microcell Network is thought likely to
opt for a GSM-based PCS system although no technology decision has yet
been announced.

Existing cellular operators Rogers Cantel and Mobility Personacom
Canada did as well as they could expect with 10 MHz each.  They were
unable to apply for 30 MHz blocks because they are subject to a
spectrum cap (Mobile Communications, 174/3).  No technology decisions
have yet been announced by these two operators.  Both are expected to
make use of the new spectrum to relieve areas of high congestion on
their existing networks.

There is speculation that the 40 MHz of spectrum that Industry Canada
has held back might also end up going to Rogers Cantel and Mobility
Personacom Canada once their spectrum caps expire in three years' time.
 According to one industry commentator this solution would give new
operators Clearnet PCS and Microcell Network a head start but would
then at the end of the three-year period create a level playing field
with each of the four PCS operators ending up with 30 MHz of spectrum.

PCS services are expected to be launched by 1997 at the latest,
initially in the main urban areas of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.
This would initially involve cellular voice services although more
innovative applications are likely to be introduced at a later stage.

TWO COULD BE COMPANY FOR VODAFONE AND AIRTOUCH

A merger between AirTouch of the USA and Vodafone of the UK, the
world's two leading international cellular operators, would offer
considerable benefits to both, according to an investment report from
UK securities house Robert Fleming.

The report, published at the end of last month, argues that a merger
would create major economies of scale, particularly in Europe where the
new company, which Robert Fleming calls AirFone, would run cellular
networks in virtually every country.  Airfone would also have a major
presence in the US and Asia-Pacific regions.

In Europe, the merged company would be in a strong position to extract
better interconnection terms from fixed network operators or even,
depending on EU regulations, to build its own long-distance and
international links to carry cellular traffic between its national
operations.  Such a move would substantially improve margins on calls.
In addition, a merged company would be able to generate increased
revenues from users roaming across Europe by requiring its customers to
roam only to its own networks, thus reducing the scale of outpayments
made to other operators.

The two companies would also have a stronger say in the running of the
Globalstar satellite venture, in which both are currently involved as
individual shareholders.

Robert Fleming foresees little opposition to a merger from existing
shareholders, many of whom, such as US financial institutions Fidelity
and Capital Research, are already investors in both companies.

Discussion of the merits of a possible AirTouch-Vodafone alliance --
which is not thought to be an imminent prospect -- is the result of
investor concern over the weakness of Vodafone's share price since
November.  This weakness, which has been largely caused by fears about
the increased level of competition that Vodafone is facing in the UK,
has led to concern that the company could be becoming undervalued,
prompting analysts to examine a number of ways in which the real worth
of the company could be more properly realised.  But any proposal for a
merger would probably have to wait at least until the retirement of
Vodafone's chairman and chief executive, Sir Gerry Whent, in two years'
time.

Other recent analyst suggestions on how to unlock Vodafone's value have
included proposals for a demerger of its international business from
its UK operation.  It is argued that this would allow the hidden value
of the international business to be realised.  But a demerger is
dismissed by Robert Fleming as unrealistic, on the grounds that such a
move would run counter to the global trend for consolidation in the
cellular industry and would also expose Vodafone's relatively weak
position in the UK.

More likely is the idea of spinning off individual foreign operations
in which Vodafone holds a stake.  Aside from profitability, Vodafone
would also have to secure the support of other shareholders before a
flotation could take place.  Candidates for such a strategy, which
would not happen at least until next year, would include Greek GSM
operator Panafon and Vodafone's Australian GSM operator, which is also
called Vodafone.

ONE IN FOUR USERS UNHAPPY

One in four of those cellular users who pay their own bills now regret
buying their telephones, according to a survey by the Consumers'
Association which criticises poor quality service and unreliable
equipment.  The results of the survey -- which involved questioning
thousands of users of all types, but excluded from the analysis those
users for whom the bills are paid by someone else, such as their
employer -- is published next month in the association's two-monthly
Consumer Policy Review magazine.

The survey also criticises the contracts that service providers offer
to users.  This is already the subject of an Office of Fair Trading
inquiry (Mobile Communications, 184/1).  The OFT wrote to nine service
providers in November, telling them to change their contract terms, or
risk court action.  Some of these service providers have responded, but
it is unclear whether all of them have done so.  The OFT has yet to
take further action.

ORANGE FLOAT PLANS

Hutchison Telecom UK, the parent of Orange, has confirmed the formation
of a bank syndicate to underwrite the initial public offering in the
mobile operator later this year.  Global co-ordinators Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson and Goldman Sachs will lead the sale.  Senior managers
in the UK and Europe will be ABN Amro Hoare Govett and NatWest.  Lehman
Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette will manage
the offering in the USA.  HSBC and a few other banks with a strong
presence in the Asia-Pacific region will handle the sale in the rest of
the world.

The offering now appears likely to take place in the second quarter of
1995, rather than the first quarter, which is thought to have been
Hutchison's initial wish.

Hutchison Telecom, owned by Hutchison Whampoa and British Aerospace, is
valued at about #2 billion but its owners are not expected to sell more
than a 25-per-cent stake.

WAVELENGTH SET TO OFFER NATIONAL PAMR SERVICE

The UK will have a second national public access mobile radio (pamr)
operator from the start of next month with the launch of an expanded
service by regional operator Wavelength.

The company has linked together its existing regional networks, which
cover 70 per cent of the UK's population, in order to offer a UK
service in competition with National Band Three.

Up to now, Wavelength's coverage has had significant gaps, for instance
between Birmingham and Manchester.  These will now be bridged by
providing coverage on major roads linking its regional networks -- an
arrangement which is allowed under Wavelength's regional licences.

The company will continue to target the traditional pamr market of
transport or service companies and will not attempt to branch out to
consumers.

``Wavelength's move should boost competition in the UK pamr market,''
said one observer.  ``National Band Three has better coverage and
capacity because it has more transmitters and leased lines.  But
Wavelength, with less infrastructure, might be cheaper.''

Wavelength, which has 5,000 users, has been expanding since its
takeover in 1994 by Telesystem International Wireless (TIW), a Canadian
company that invests in mobile communications ventures (Mobile
Communications, 156/6).

In the autumn of 1994, TIW won six out of nine regional pamr licences
awarded by the Department of Trade and Industry (Mobile Communications,
159/5).

UK RADIO AGENCY SET TO LICENSE DIY SERVICES

The Radiocommunications Agency will next week (January 18) allow UK
users to run their own limited mobile radio services when it issues the
first licences for Short Range Business Radio (SRBR) services.

The new licences, which will cost #30 for three years, will enable
users to use analogue SRBR handsets to provide themselves with radio
and paging services over a range of up to 400 metres, without the need
for infrastructure.  The technology is suitable for locations such as
building sites, hospitals or industrial estates.

The agency expects eventually to be issuing about 500 licences a year,
although by this week it had received only one application.

The licences should prove attractive since the only cost of the new
service, after having paid the licence fee, will be the purchase of
handsets and paging units.  Users do not incur any airtime, connection
or rental costs.

Motorola will next week launch Handie-Com, the first SRBR product
range.  Motorola was one of the main manufacturers behind the much-
delayed technology.

SRBR is linked to a similar technology, known as Digital Short Range
Radio (DSRR), which the Department of Trade and Industry had wanted to
see implemented as long ago as 1990 (Mobile Communications, 184/11).
