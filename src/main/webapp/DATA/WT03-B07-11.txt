INSURING PRIVATE MEDICAL EXPENSES

The UK Market

Strong encouragement by government for people to make their own welfare
provision means that private medical expenses cover continues to be an
attractive employee benefit.  Individuals who are not insured by their
employer have the option of buying private plans.  In response, some
insurers have introduced a range of low cost schemes to accommodate
businesses and individuals unable to finance more comprehensive cover.

Despite energetic marketing by provident associations and insurers as
well as increasing criticism directed at the National Heath Service
(NHS), the market for private medical insurance has not grown for many
years.  Peter Mannion, assistant actuary, Munich Re, told a recent
conference in London that only 11% of the UK population was insured,
with market share being gained by new entrants largely at the expense
of the leading providents.

He identified flaws in private medical cover and suggested some
solutions.

* With products varying considerably in coverage, it might be helpful
if each type of product had guaranteed minimum cover.  There would
still be scope for competition in coverage above the minimum and in
other areas such as service and premiums.

* Insurers often adjust cover at renewal, sometimes limiting it or
introducing lower monetary limits.  This can be confusing for
policyholders and other routes might be tried to protect the
underwriting result.

* Private medical cover is not really designed to cover chronic
conditions, particularly those resulting from ageing and most insurers
turn off such claims when treatment becomes of a palliative nature.  Mr
Mannion suggested insurers consider whether cover could be extended or
whether a cash benefit could be offered in such circumstances.

* Medical insurance has a reputation for rapidly rising premiums; as
well as inflation in medical costs, policyholders have to cope with
heavy premium hikes when they move into a new five year age band,
meaning that cover may become unaffordable as people age.  One solution
might be designing long term contracts with level premiums (other than
inflation increases) throughout, as offered by the Exeter Friendly
Society.  There is also scope for life insurers to enter the market via
this route.

Private medical expenses cover is a significant part of the UK
healthcare market which includes other products such as income
replacement benefit, critical illness cover, long term care insurance
and major medical expenses.  Income replacement benefit sales have
fallen in the last five years despite reductions in state disability
welfare benefits last year.  The other three - critical illness cover,
long term care insurance and major medical expenses - have so far
failed to make significant inroads in the market.

Major medical expenses insurance was introduced in 1992 as an
alternative to private medical expenses cover.  A number of insurers
offer this including Canada Life, GAN Life, Lincoln National, Old
Mutual and Scottish Mutual.  Generally cover is marketed in combination
with life assurance and some other benefits such as income protection.

Future prospects

The private medical expenses insurance customer base should expand
during the remainder of the 1990s, according to Laing's Review of
Private Healthcare 1995.  However, the rate of growth will depend on a
number of factors including: price of cover; the impact of new
distribution channels for individual paid cover; product innovation;
government policy, and public perception of the NHS.

The review also looks at whether commercial insurers are poised to take
a substantially larger share of the market during the 1990s.  It says
that in the early 1990s, the company sector - traditionally dominated
by the providents - became more ready to switch insurers.  By 1992,
commercial insurers' share of the company paid market reached 22.2%
although, with the exit of ITT London & Edinburgh, the share dropped
back to 19.1% in January-June 1994 (the last period for which figures
are available) as ITT London & Edinburgh's book of business transferred
to other insurers including the providents.  "The effect of this exit
has now worked its way through the system and it is likely, though
complete figures are not yet available, that the commercials' share of
company paid PMI business has started to grow again".

Commercial insurers' penetration of the individual paid market,
including small groups, initially grew more slowly with switching
between insurers being discouraged by pre-existing conditions
exclusions used by most insurers as a means of avoiding anti-selection.
 Laing's puts the commercials' share of such subscription income as
18.8% by June 1994 but suggests it has probably increased further since
with the continuing growth of Norwich Union's individual business.

Scope for further fragmentation of the market depends on barriers to
entry and economies of scale.  Industry sources suggest that a
subscription income of #50m to #100m per annum may be necessary to take
full advantage of the fixed costs of setting up a comprehensive in-
house claims administration system.   "Ultimately, the key to whether
commercial insurers will sustain and consolidate their position in the
individual and corporate markets will depend on whether they can keep
their administrative overheads and new business acquisition costs low
enough to remain competitive in the long term."

EUROPEAN TRENDS

In this report - European healthcare trends: towards manged care in
Europe - Coopers & Lybrand describes and analyses health reforms in
17 countries.

There are wide variations between European healthcare systems but there
are many shared perspectives and themes in their reform programmes,
because they are responses to common pressures and the possibilities
offered by modern management and information systems.  However, the
report does not imply that a single model of health reform has emerged;
each country has responded to features of its own health system.

The starting point for most healthcare reforms has been concern to
control escalating costs.  Other objectives, such as to improve the
state of public health, to ensure equitable access to health services,
to improve the quality of health services and to make health services
more responsive to public preferences, have been major determinants.

While central measures to control cost have had an important impact,
the main aim of health reforms has been to change the way decisions are
made about the direction and management of health services.  The aim is
to create a self-regulating system, which reflects an appropriate
balance between the desired level and quality of service and affordable
resources.

The report states that the impacts of European health reforms can be
seen at four levels in decision making

* health objectives, policy and responsibilities are more clearly
defined

* health purchasing (insurance) decisions are separated from heath
provision and in some cases general practitioners are involved in
purchasing

* the management of health service provision integrates the management
of medical practice and the management of resources, in response to
patient needs

* the management of patient treatment and care is based upon evidence
of best practice regardless of setting

The merging themes in healthcare management can be seen as trends
towards a European form of managed care which supports: national health
targets; community health gain; disease management, and patient focused
care.

Some of these reflect trends in the US but they are being given new
meanings because European healthcare systems have social welfare
objectives and reflect a concern with community as well as individual
health.

Conclusions

Following detailed discussion and analysis, the report concludes that
the experience of European healthcare systems during the 1980s revealed
the limitations of a reform strategy that concentrated almost
exclusively on macroeconomic measures for cost containment.  Management
of European healthcare in the 1990s has changed its primary focus to
structural reform to ensure cost reduction (or cost inflation
containment) without compromising basic healthcare quality and access.

Successful healthcare management needs to reconcile the interests of
individuals with long-term health gain objectives of a community.  The
key to achieving this is to develop service strategies which are
monitored on a case-by-case basis to ensure that they are continuously
improved to meet national and community targets for health.  European
approaches to managed care achieve this by a balance of competitive
choice and controls and incentives.

The report says that implementation of competitive choice requires well-
informed individuals and agencies capable of assessing cost benefit
choices for the community.  Both individuals and agencies must have the
ability to influence the performance of healthcare providers.
Competing choices must be exercised within a framework of controls and
incentives which ensure that minimum standards are met and improvements
are recognised and rewarded.

In many social insurance based systems, the sickness funds are facing a
change from being regional administrative organisations (payers) to
commissioners (strategic buyers) or risk-sharing enterprises that
operate nationally.  Both tax based and social insurance systems are
recognising the importance of primary care physicians as gatekeepers to
secondary and community care.

Provision of secondary healthcare in European countries, with or
without internal markets, is increasingly being based on contracting
mechanisms and performance oriented payment using case-mix groupings
and quality specifications.  Reforms aiming at more effective hospital
management in many European countries involve clinical participation in
management, including devolution of budgetary management accountability
to clinical level.  In primary care, physicians are developing new
skills as gatekeepers and fundholders, resulting in a substantial
change of emphasis from secondary to primary care.

Equity is an issue because an increasing gap between resources and
demand is forcing priority setting and rationing which has to be
justified by reference to social values.  Since all European healthcare
systems must be seen as elements of social welfare, equity is an
important issue in all countries.  Health reforms with or without
purchaser-provider separation make rationing more explicit so it is
therefore essential that the basis for rationing should be accepted as
fair.

The report also concludes that purchasing of healthcare services is
increasingly being based on knowledge derived from epidemiological
needs assessment and measures of outcomes research and quality
assurance programmes.  On the provider side, effective disease
management strategies are increasingly based on medical treatment
guidelines.  Knowledge based purchasing and provision of healthcare in
the 1990s will be heavily dependent on information systems.

INTERNATIONAL MARKETING

AtIBC's Healthcare Industry Conference last November, Neil Horseman,
market manager, BUPA International, looked at the feasibility of
internationally marketing products.

Referring to international concern about current trends in state
healthcare provisions, Mr Horseman discussed whether or not
international marketing of healthcare insurance products was a
realistic goal.  "From small, mature markets like Spain and the
Netherlands, to the vast populations of China and Brazil, people
throughout the world are taking a very serious look at the potential
for private healthcare.  The market has already grown substantially in
recent years, and is set for further continued expansion well into the
next century."

However, while international marketing can be achieved, there are a
number of important considerations.  Markets must be considered
individually as they vary enormously.  "Even countries that seem very
similar in many respects can represent very different marketing
propositions - perhaps due to a minor difference in legislation."

* The impact of local legislation must be taken into account.  In the
United States, for example, legislation makes it virtually impossible
for a non-US company to break into the market.  In other countries, the
regime is slightly more relaxed in theory, but made impenetrable in
practice by a maze of rules and regulations, with the European
Community being a typical example.  Products need to be tailored to
suit local requirements.

* Access is an issue with problems arising from time differences,
different languages, different cultures and different business
environments.  The change in political climates around the world is
helping to ease problems to a  certain extent.  In developed countries,
in particular, the trend towards de-regulation is opening up many new
opportunities.

* Cultural complexity is a major issue in itself.  Differing cultural
values can affect not only marketing but even the validity of the
product as, for example, in Saudi Arabia where the concept of insurance
is somewhat alien to the local culture and could be interpreted as
interfering with destiny.  In Vietnam, most people do not use the state
health service, preferring self-medication or traditional healers.  "If
people don't take advantage of the free state health service, they are
unlikely to be inclined to pay for private treatment."

Mr Horseman stressed that essentially private medical expenses insurers
are selling peace of mind, rather than a tangible product, so buying
cover is as much an emotional decision as a practical one.  Any market
proposition must take account of the fact that people's emotional view
of life is coloured considerably by cultural factors such as religion
and lifestyle.

In a competitive market, there will also be competition from local
healthcare insurers so new entrants must invest in building a brand
image in which people can have total confidence.  "That means having
the people, resources and capability to deal with customers' problems
quickly and efficiently.  It means having the right structure in place,
from distribution through to service delivery."  Customer service is a
key issue, as is cost.

Mr Horseman emphasised the importance of research, product definition
and service, distribution and marketing strategies.  He concluded that
international marketing is a realistic goal - but only for those
prepared to make the effort to get things right.

INDUSTRIAL FIRE PREMIUM DOWN

German industrial fire insurers expect premium income in 1996 to drop
sharply due to price reductions leading to even higher underwriting
losses than those expected for 1995, Klaus Nowitzky, chief executive of
Jaspers Industrie Assekuranz GmbH & Co KG (JIA), Frankfurt, told a
press conference in Dusseldorf recently.  Industrial insurers were
"displaying their irrationality", he said.  "The same insurers who
recently still praised the Konsortialkommissionen (Kokos) are now
heating up competition by substantially undercutting existing premium
levels."

Peak risks in particular had gone down in price, he said.  "Good peak
risks are now quoted 25% below their former price; on average all peak
risks pay 20% less," Mr Nowitzky claimed.  In some instances rate cuts
of 40% had been granted, Ottokar Engelhardt, another JIA executive,
added.  The market for smaller risks was also softening rapidly.
Overall, income in industrial fire in 1996 will be down by more than
DM300m on the estimated DM4.2bn for 1995, the JIA executives said.
"We wonder whether the industrial insurance market went out of control
by accident, or whether it was a conscious decision to force some
insurers out of the market," Mr Nowitzky said, commenting in Allianz'
decision to leave the German fire tariff.  Manufacturing industry was
happy to receive premium reductions but was worried that small and
medium-sized insurers would leave the market eventually.  "We would be
left with an oligopoly, and this is certainly not in the interests of
industrial insurance customers," Mr Nowitzky said.  He added that the
irrationality of the situation was underlined by examples of companies
imposing premium increases for 1995, "always with the justification
that higher prices were urgently needed because of the risk situation",
a position new undermined in fresh price talks for 1996.  There was
even talk of reinsurers planning a new round of market rehabilitation
measures for 1 January 1997, keeping the industry on a roller coaster
ride.

GUJARAT CONTINUES CROP COVER

The Gujarat government has continued the Comprehensive Crop Insurance
Scheme (CCIS) for the rabi (winter) 1995-96 season in the state subject
to certain conditions.  The scheme covers crops of wheat (irrigated and
unirrigated), gram, rape seed and mustard, summer groundnut and summer
barja (coarse grain).  The indemnity limits are 80% for wheat
(irrigated), rape seed and mustard, summer groundnut and summer barja
and 60% for gram and wheat (unirrigated).  Insurance is limited to
Rs10,000 per farmer, irrespective of the loan taken, while the total
insured sum is 100% of the crop loan.  Under the scheme, 107 talukas
have been notified as "defined area" for wheat (irrigated), 37 for
summer groundnut, 30 talukas each for rape seed and mustard and summer
barja, 25 for gram and 20 talukas for wheat (unirrigated).

EMSS RESEARCH BEGINS

The Loss Prevention Council (LPC) is collaborating with Imperial
College London to investigate the links between Environmental
Management Systems (EMSs) and insurance.  EMSs are new tools by which
insurers may be able to assess and quantify the environmental
performance of their clients.  The LPC says that governments and
international agencies agree that continued, sustainable economic
development depends on the availability of adequate insurance cover for
environmental risks.  However, insurers are said to be wary of such
risks, particularly because of past experiences in the United States.

A three-year study entitled The Response of the Insurance Industry to
Developments in Environmental Management Systems recently began at the
Centre for Environmental Technology at Imperial College London.  The
research is aimed at analysing the response of insurers to the
introduction of EMSs as expressed in their attitudes towards their
clients' environmental performance, as well as supplying insurers with
information gathered during the study on the usefulness and benefits of
EMSs.

The study will also address the following questions.  What are the main
constraints on the environmental insurance market?  Are these caused by
uncertainties in technical assessment, or other problems such as long-
term uncertainty in legal liability?  How do insurers currently assess
the environmental performance of their clients - if at all?

In the medium term, the study aims to determine whether and to what
extent compliance with EMSs standards supports insurers' own assessment
systems, and also whether and how insurers might effectively use EMSs
in their assessments.

GANGSTAR DEALERS CARRY RISK

Unlike other motor manufacturers, Beijing Jeep is not providing
indemnity assurances to dealers but states in its dealer agreement that
in liability issues the dealer will be expected to "defend and
indemnify" the distributor.  Beijing Jeep which makes GangStar is owned
by the Chinese government.  When the Yugoslavia-built Yugo entered the
US market in the mid-1980s, its distributor agreed to stand behind the
product to defend its dealers.

TERMINATION OF MOTOR POLICIES

The German supervisory authority Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das
Versicherungswesen (BAV), Berlin, is attempting to change the date by
which a motor policyholder can terminate a policy.  This is a matter of
some concern for insurers, because of the growing movement of insureds
between underwriters.  So far the BAV has shared the view of the
industry that for "old" contracts ie those signed before July 1994
(when liberalised laws came into effect) a three-month notice period
was required.  As most German motor policies begin on 1 January, this
would have meant that the majority of German motorists could not have
switched insurers in January 1996 unless they had decided to terminate
their policy before 1 October 1995 - when the current price war had
just started.

Only for "new" policies signed under the new law was a one-month period
legally binding, ran the old interpretation.  But in mid-November,
shortly before the final date for the one-month notice, BAV suddenly
changed its mind and said that "after scrutinising the legal situation
again" it had come to the conclusion that all policyholders, old and
new, could cancel with just one month's notice.  This, at least, is the
view with regard to TPL contracts; it remains unclear whether
comprehensive policies are also included in this interpretation.

Many insurers, including leading provider of low price motor cover HUK-
Coburg (Haftpflicht-Unterstutzungs-Kasse Kraftfahrender Beamter
Deutschlands aG), have already voluntarily offered the possibility of
termination after one month to their customers.  But HUK-Coburg chief
executive Rolf-Peter Hoenen is also head of the motor committee in the
property and casualty insurers' federation Verband der Sachversicherer
(VdS), Bonn, and in this role he is critical of BAV's changed view,
because it has confused the situation.  He believes that the courts
will have to settle the argument.

Insurers were expected to submit their new motor tariffs, to take
effect from 1 January, to the Ministry of Commerce.  According to the
minister, Nikos Akritidis, the average increases will be determined by
the large public and private insurers.  However, despite the minister's
guarded optimism that the average increase would be 20%, the real
figure is expected to be around 30%.  Large private insurers are
expected to set an even higher rise in premiums.

The increases will not be uniform for the whole of the country.  For
example, the largest public insurer, National Insurance (Ethniki
Asfalistiki), will adopt different tariffs for the Attica prefecture
(+29%) than for the other regions (+19%).  Other insurers were also
reported to be planning greater increases in the large urban areas,
smaller ones in the country and even smaller ones in the border
regions.

The increases relate exclusively to the compulsory civil liability
element of cover.  However, the premium hikes are expected to lead to a
drop of up to 50% in complementary covers such as fire and theft which
most motorists bought before.

RATES WARNING

A specialist UK motor insurer warns that changes in reinsurance rates
and the need for bigger reserves will inevitably put pressure on rates.
 Recent legal developments have introduced the use of actuarial
evidence in determining multipliers and the adoption of a discount rate
linked to the yield of index linked government securities.  These
combined factors will have an enormous impact upon the claims burden
falling to UK motor insurers and reinsurers, says the insurer.

Relevant developments are the production of the "Ogden" tables and the
Civil Evidence bill in October 1995 which permits courts to adopt Ogden
multipliers in the assessment of personal injury damages in all future
cases brought before them.  This means that if a personal injury claim
for an accident that occurred in, say, 1988 now comes before the court,
Ogden multipliers may be applied to the assessment of that claim.

It has been estimated that these new multipliers will produce a general
increase in claims of between 15% and 25% but could be as high as 50%.
Not all claims will be affected but plaintiff solicitors are currently
pleading Ogden level multipliers in approximately 10% of all cases.
This percentage is sure to rise very quickly, warns the insurer, as
otherwise there could be implications for solicitors' E&O policies.

The insurer states that the overall effect will be an increase in
insurers' reserves for outstanding claims, which will be seen in many
reinsurance programmes now under negotiation as well as those in the
future.  As the introduction is retrospective, the 1996 revenue year
will see adverse developments due to increased reserves on prior year
claims.
Significant effects are already being shown on quotations for
reinsurance for 1996.  The insurer concludes that these increases,
coupled with the deterioration in claims reserves, will almost
certainly force appreciable premium increases on the industry early
this year.

WORST EUROPEAN RECORD FOR CAR CRIME

British motorists are at much greater risk of having their cars stolen
than drivers in the rest of Europe, according to the second annual
European Car Crime study by a UK insurer.  The study, compiled from the
latest EU government and insurance organisation statistics, compared
the number of cars stolen in 1994 in each country with the total number
of cars in use.

The UK has by far the worst record for car crime, with an average of 22
cars per thousand on the road stolen in 1994.  That is nearly double
the level in the next worst country, France, where 12.5 cars per
thousand were stolen in 1994.  The study found that car theft is lowest
in Austria where less than two cars per thousand were stolen in 1994.
The next most secure country was Switzerland, where just three per
thousand cars went missing.

Overall, a lower proportion of cars were stolen in 1994 than in 1993.
The European average fell from 11.7 thefts per thousand cars to 9.7.
In the UK, the proportion was down from 29 to 22 per thousand.

CARGO TARIFF RETURNS

The General Insurance Corporation of India (GIC) has re-introduced
tariff regulations for a wide variety of commodities.  The GIC has
issued a directive to its four subsidiaries announcing new tariff rates
which, in effect, bring back regulation to marine cargo rates
deregulated in April 1994.  Since then, rate cutting has been rife in
the sector with a fall in premium rates for crude oil from about 0.8%
of cargo value to as low as 0.01%.  Rates for certain raw materials and
capital goods fell from 1.5% to 0.03%, a fall of almost 100% in both
cases.  In order to bring back stability, the GIC has re-introduced
tariffs and also introduced tariffs for commodities not tariffed before
April 1994 such as metal pipes and tubes, oil cakes and cashew nuts.

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE PLANS

CapMac, leading credit "enhancer" of asset based securities, is
planning to launch financial guarantee cover in India through Asia Ltd.
 The intention reflects the fact that the increasing role of the
private sector in infrastructure has led to demand for credit rating
such projects.  Since financial guarantee insurance helps in achieving
higher rating for debt instruments, it would allow the promoter of an
infrastructure project to market infrastructure revenue bonds more
effectively than on a stand alone basis.  Potential for financial
guarantee insurance is also enhanced by the capital adequacy
requirements for financial institutions and banks, likely emergence of
a municipal bond market and initiatives taken to activate the asset-
based securities in the country.

Mahesh K Kotecha, managing director of CapMac, said that CapMac's
regional financial guarantee company, Asia Ltd, plans to underwrite
infrastructure revenue bonds and asset-based securities to the
international rating agencies' high non-investment grade standards.
The company will also refer deals it guarantees for additional credit
enhancement to triple-A rated agencies such as World Bank, Asian
Development Bank and CapMac.

Traditionally, the supply of infrastructure has been the responsibility
of the government.  However, because of the ballooning fiscal deficit,
the government has had difficulty in allocating adequate resources and
so has facilitated entry by the private sector by offering a number of
fiscal and tax incentives.

MANDATORY COVER FOR BANK DEPOSITS

The Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, has passed a law introducing a
mandatory insurance scheme to protect private investors against lost
bank deposits.  Compensation will be paid from a special fund whose
authorised capital is to be financed by the state budget.  The fund's
reserve capital will come from insurance premiums, late payment fees
and fines, revenue from investments and money received from banks under
receivership procedures.  The maximum sum insured will be 5,000 litas
and investors will be able to claim 80% of the value of their deposits.

The fund will only pay out compensation for deposits held with domestic
banks in the national currency.  Foreign currency accounts and deposits
held with subsidiaries and branches of Lithuanian banks abroad will not
be covered.

employed, cover is available for accident, sickness, bankruptcy, or the
involuntary liquidation of the relevant business.  The policy offers up
to 12 months' benefit after an initial qualifying period of 60
consecutive days.

PRIVATE HEALTH CONCERNS

A member company of Allianz AG Holding is concerned at the long-term
trend in the private health market towards rising losses and weak
growth.  Chief executive Dr Jan Boetius is convinced that Health
Maintenance Organisation (HMO) models similar to those used in the US
will be necessary.  Cost control within the industry, which covers
around 10% of the German population, is a problem, not unlike the
statutory system of health funds, Dr Boetius admitted, and new methods
of providing care will have to be found.

"At present, people only think about spreading the costs, not avoiding
or controlling them.  It is our principle that cost control and cost
avoidance should come before cost distribution," Dr Boetius told WPG
sister publication, World Insurance Corporate Report.  "At the moment
we have two dual relationships, patient/doctor and patient/insurer.
The patient goes to his doctor and gets treatment, receives the bill
and sends it to us.  Only at that point can we say anything and, for
example, check whether unnecessary treatment has been carried out or
whether the charge has been properly calculated."

"We cannot break away from this mechanism, as long as we are always
behind the event.  Therefore we have to turn these two bilateral
relationships into a trilateral one.  We need to have direct contact
with the doctors and therapists," Dr Boetius said.  He could imagine,
for example, a Gatekeeper model - setting specific sums per patient for
a doctor.  From this sum he will also pay any specialists to whom he
refers the patient.  "The American models cannot be transferred to us
as they are, but we need the basic principle.  In order to really
control costs, the people who provide the services have to be closely
connected with those paying."

Concerns about increased claims were also reflected by a premium rate
increase introduced by another insurer, Allgemeine Ortskrankenkasse
(AOK) of Lower Saxony, this year.  Meanwhile, PKV-Verband, Cologne, the
association of private health insurers, has set up a working group to
discuss the HMO concept.

BANK-INSURER ALLIANCE

Norway's third largest commercial bank Fokus Bank A/S has formed an
alliance with Denmark's second largest insurer for the development and
sale of savings and insurance products.  The alliance will initially
centre on life insurance, pension and other types of personal cover,
which will be marketed as Fokus products throughout the bank's
distribution network in Norway.  Fokus said the agreement formed part
of its strategy to offer customers a complete portfolio of financial
products.

For the insurer, the alliance marks its first success in gaining a
foothold in the Norwegian market.  The British-Danish group - 65%
owned by the UK's Sun Alliance - was involved in a take-over contest
for Forenede Forsikring A/S in the early 1990s and has also shown
interest in Vital Forsikring A/S, which is currently at the centre of
an ownership battle between Den norske Bank A/S and Dutch insurer Aegon
NV.

NEW SUBSIDENCE RATING SYSTEM

A specialist insurer of higher value households is pioneering a
revolutionary system, provided by the British Geological Survey (BGS),
for rating the subsidence risk of individual properties.  The
computerised system - known as the Geo Hazard Susceptibility Package 2
(GHASP 2) - is based on the BGS's 1:10,000-scale geological maps, the
most detailed information on geo hazards available across the UK.  It
enables the underwriter to pinpoint the precise bedrock beneath
individual properties, even where situated close to other properties.

The insurer says that the system represents a major advance on other
current methods of assessing subsidence risk, which are based just on
the first three or four digits of a postcode and give only the average
risk for groups of several hundred homes.  It claims that use of GHASP
2 will lead to premium savings of up to 60% for existing policyholders
with lower risk properties that are currently included within higher
risk postcodes, and even bigger reduction for policyholders moving to
the underwriter from other insurers.

The new rating system is being applied to the underwriter's 606 High
Value House and Contents Policy and will be used in particular to rate
properties in southern England, where many postcodes are susceptible
locally to a wide variety of geo hazards.

QUADRIPLEGIA AND PARAPLEGIA COVER

A Lloyd's broking and financial services group has launched what it
claims is a unique personal accident programme for schools and sports
clubs, providing 24 hour cover for pupils/members for permanent total
disablement resulting in quadriplegia or paraplegia.  This cover can
top-up an existing policy to a total limit of #1m per pupil.

Director Graham Reid said: "The risk of quadriplegia or paraplegia is
of increasing concern to authorities today, where existing policies are
totally inadequate.  This policy now offers a realistic level of
indemnity for sportsmen and women who will, in the main, have their
full life in front of them".  More than seven million people receive
hospital treatment as a result of accidents each year and it is
estimated that of these 1.8m are sports related.

MANDATORY COVER FOR SELF-EMPLOYED

From the beginning of this year, Colorado insurers are legally obliged
to provide health cover for self-employed people, regardless of their
medical condition or type of business.  Those who have been trading for
at least a year can select cover under a standard benefit plan from any
of more than 80 small group carriers in Colorado.  Under the small
group health insurance reform legislation, carriers cannot exclude
cover for a pre-existing health condition for more than six months and
must give credit for pre-existing condition exclusion periods already
met under a prior policy.
