<p><font size="3">The Istituto per l&#146;Automazione Navale
(IAN) has conducted research in the marine-maritime field for
over twenty years. The focus has been on increasing navigation
safety and efficiency and on developing systems for the
protection of coasts and the marine environment. The expertise
gained in field research in collaboration with experts and scientists from
related disciplines has earned IAN a significant role in major
national and international programmes.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">IAN&#146;s research has undergone a natural
evolution over the years in terms of objectives and now centres
on the following areas: </font></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li><a href="/navig/basenavi.htm"><font size="3">Navigation
        and Maritime Traffic</font></a></li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="navi" </a><font size="3">SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY IN
MARITIME NAVIGATION</font></a></h3>

<p><font size="3">The earliest Italian studies on ship automation
and safety in navigation were conducted in the mid- to late
sixties by Genoa University&#146;s Faculty of Engineering.
Funding for this research was provided by Italy's National
Research Council (CNR), the state organization which encompasses
IAN.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The university workgroup was later joined by a
purposely-created CNR laboratory, the Laboratorio per l'Automazione
Navale, which constituted the initial core of present-day IAN and
was subsequently to gain Institute status. In collaboration with
various Italian state organizations and industrial concerns, the
two partners launched the Esquilino Project. The goal was to
install a complex control system based on a central processing
computer on board Lloyd Triestino&#146;s m/v
&#147;Esquilino&#148;, which served the route from Italy to the
Far East. This centralized system would ensure automated engine
operation and navigation tasks, the latter involving optimization
procedures designed to achieve minimum transit times and safety
on the specific leg. Sensors and instruments were employed to
increase knowledge of the naval process, and data collected
during experimental campaigns from 1969 to 1973 was exhaustively
processed. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Following the advent of microprocessors, the
convenience of low-cost computers offering a high degree of
integration steered IAN&#146;s application projects towards
onboard automation and microcomputers linked into a local
network, with a supervisor which also had a backup function. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The end of the 70&#146;s saw the start of
intense experimentation to explore the feasibility of using
telecommunications via INMARSAT satellites to optimize
navigation. The final goal was to increase cost-effectiveness and
safety in sea carriage while at the same time analysing the
performance of commercial operators. The program was also
intended to promote the construction of a national INMARSAT
satellite terminal in collaboration with related industrial
concerns and the Istituto Superiore Poste and Telecomunicazioni.
To pursue this goal, campaigns were conducted onboard CNR&#146;s
oceanographic vessel &quot;Bannock&quot;, which was equipped with
sensors and instruments to collect navigation, meteo-oceanographic
and propulsion data. These were initially processed by a local
network of microcomputers and then forwarded to the processor
that automated satellite terminal operation; subsequently a
programmed transmission was sent in real time to the computation
centre at IAN via a ship-to-ship connection. The first phase of
the project received scientific contribution from D.F.V.L.R.,
West Germany&#146;s Institute for Space Research, which had
entered into a long-term agreement for scientific partnership
with IAN.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Although progress in ship-to-shore
communication virtually solved the problem of creating fast,
reliable links between onboard and mainland networks, the need
remained for a shore service that would be able to integrate
messages from ships with information from ports, traffic control
stations, coastguards, shipping companies and shipping agencies.
The Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) was the answer to this need.
This is a shore service designed to collect systematically all sea
traffic information available in its area by constantly checking
all vessels transiting within its range. The VTS can also relay
to ships any information that may be needed and offer advice to
help increase safety and regularity in the area's traffic
patterns.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The technical-scientific know-how gained by IAN
in the maritime sector provided the ideal basis for further investigation
of VTSs and the complex issues involved. In 1983 the Commission
of the European Communities launched the COST301 Project,
&#147;Shore-based Assistance to Maritime Navigation&#148; and IAN
was assigned an important role in organizing and co-ordinating
the relevant national Workgroup, which was composed of experts
with different professional backgrounds.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In view of its background, IAN was entrusted
with co-ordination of task 8.50, which involved a series of
real-time experimental trials known as Meditrials. These were to
provide a preliminary framework for a feasibility study of a regional
VTS system covering the whole Mediterranean. The Mediterranean
trials required the establishment of a Co-ordination Centre in
the Port of Genoa (called MECC) and were made possible by
long-term partnership between four countries: France, Greece,
Italy and Spain. After four preliminary tests, the actual
Meditrials started and were completed between September and
November 1986. The trials saw the active participation of 26
ports, 8 transit stations, 5,000 vessels (33 of which offering
uninterrupted collaboration) and 16 shipowners, amounting to
13,742 information packages - equal to approximately 150,000 data
items. The trials&#146; considerable success has demonstrated the
feasibility of developing a Mediterranean-wide system of maritime
traffic services, called Regional Vessel Traffic Services. </font></p>

<h3><a name="ocea" </a><font size="3">SYSTEMS FOR MARINE
ENVIRONMENT MONITORING AND PROTECTION</font></a></h3>

<p><font size="3">The first research efforts in this field date
back to 1973 and were conducted both on the oceanographic vessel &#147;Bannock&#148;
(for the studies partly described above) and through
collaboration with various teams working on oceanographic vessel
instrumentation. In 1974, the National Research Council made IAN
responsible for the management of oceanographic vessel
instrumentation. A new department was set up to carry out the
activity, which on the one hand complemented oceanographic
research and on the other allowed the Institute to widen its
scope from merely providing assistance to studying and developing
new instruments. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Thanks to the know-how gained in marine data
collection, IAN organized and led Italy&#146;s participation (on
m/v &#147;Bannock&#148;) in NATO&#146;s 1975 International
Campaign in the Azores-based underwater electro-acoustic polygon. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the same period, IAN was involved in
drafting the &#147;Oceanography and Seafloors&#148; Applied
Project, which centred on the following areas: databases for the
marine environment, instrument calibration, steps to increase
Italian industry&#146;s interest in oceanographic
instrumentation. Within this project, IAN investigated the
following subjects: development of modular systems for data
collection in the marine environment; acquisition and operation
of a calibration system for CTD probes (salinity, temperature,
depth); participation in the EC COST 43 research programme for an
experimental network of meteo-oceanographic buoys. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The COST 43 Programme provided a suitable
framework for a number of research projects in marine technology. Italy
participated in the construction of two ODAS (Oceanographic Data
Acquisition Systems) buoys: ODAS ITALIA 1, which started
operation in 1979 and ODAS ITALIA 2, in 1982. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">ODAS ITALIA 1 is a spar buoy built in
collaboration with various parties. The buoy was moored in the
Ligurian Sea, initially south of La Spezia at a depth of 500
metres and subsequently 38 miles off the Genoa coast on the route
to Cape Corse, at a depth of 1270 metres. ODAS IT1 collects
meteo-oceanographic and physical-chemical parameters of the
marine environment and relays them at scheduled times to a
receiver station set up at IAN. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">After playing a significant role in
coordinating the development of the buoy, IAN subsequently became
responsible for running the system and covering its running
costs. The Institute has entirely redesigned and rebuilt both the
Laboratory section (containing the supply and data collection
systems) and the sensors. These are at the centre of major
studies conducted by the Buoy Optimization Work Team, a group
which was set up and is co-ordinated by the Institute. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The ODAS1 IT Project prompted the creation of
the Open-Sea Marine Laboratory, which conducts research into several
issues: analysis of the buoy&#146;s performance in rough seas, an
indispensable notion to evaluate platform stability development
of biological sampling systems, both on the buoy itself and its
mooring instrumentation and meteo-marine parameter measurement
systems designed for long-term operation in the open sea.</font></p>

<h3><a name="marine" </a><font size="3">MARINE ROBOTICS</font></a></h3>

<p><font size="3">IAN&#146;s </font><a
href="/robotics/Welcome.html"><font size="3">Department of
Robotics</font></a><font size="3"> was set up in 1989 to
investigate control of complex underwater robotic systems designed
to substitute the human operator in dangerous tasks and in
hostile environments. The main aspects addressed to date have
been mission control in autonomous underwater vehicles and the
testing of results achieved in theoretical study and simulation.
One basic activity conducted in the past few years has been the
development of a family of </font><a href="/robotics/vehicle.htm"><font
size="3">Unmanned Underwater Vehicles</font></a><font size="3">,
which are intended to serve both as test-beds and experimental
field vehicles for investigation of concrete problems. </font></p>

<p>The first prototype vehicle, called <a
href="/robotics/vehicle.htm#ROBY"><font size="3">ROBY</font></a><font
size="3">, was completed in 1990. ROBY has been defined as a
&#147;Virtual AUV&#148;, i.e. an ROV that combines a particularly
high-powered console with an underwater module featuring
remarkable sensorial and operational capabilities. A second,
vastly improved prototype vehicle, called </font><a
href="/robotics/vehicle.htm#ROBY2"><font size="3">ROBY2</font></a><font
size="3">, was constructed in 1992 and tested throughout 1993. </font></p>

<p>In the same year, the department developed a dynamic AUV
simulator called ROBYSIM. The system was designed to supply
qualitative guidelines for the development of various control
strategies, the study of navigational algorithms and on-line path
planning, the simulation of sensors and the construction of a
user-friendly man-machine interface. </p>

<p>The construction of the simulator, together with the
development and testing of a semi-automatic console, were major undertakings
that led up to ROBY2&#146;s participation in the first <a
href="/robotics/scienapp.htm#ANTARCTICA"><font size="3">Antarctic
campaign</font></a><font size="3"> in underwater robotics, which
was undertaken in 1993-94 as part of the 9th Italian Expedition
to Antarctica under the PNRA Programme (Programma Nazionale di
Ricerche in Antartide). ROBY2 helped scientists collect
oceanographic data and supported the testing of SARA (Sottomarino
Autonomo Robotizzato Antartico), a robotic system designed in
partnership with ENEA, Tecnomare and other concerns. This project
was launched by the National Commission for Research in
Antarctica and is funded by the Italian University and Research
Ministry. The aim is to develop an underwater robot that can replace
researchers in &#145;impossible tasks&#146; (such as observation
of the water-ice interface in undisturbed conditions and operation
in wintertime). </font></p>

<p>In January 1993, IAN was granted funding by the European
Commission for a three-year project to be carried out by the
Robotics Department in partnership with <a
href="http://www.cee.hw.ac.uk:80/subsea/"><font size="3">Heriot-Watt
University</font></a><font size="3"> in Edinburgh and DIST, a
department of Genoa University. The project is known as </font><a
href="/robotics/amadeus.htm"><font size="3">AMADEUS</font></a><font
size="3"> and comes under the MAST II Framework Programme in the
area of Marine Technology. It centres on advanced manipulation in
deep underwater systems, the main objective being to construct a
multifingered gripper with tactile and force-feedback sensing
facilities. The project is due to terminate in March 1996. The
European Commission has recently accepted a proposal for a
follow-up of AMADEUS (1996-1998). Greater emphasis will be placed
on autonomous sampling capabilities and scientific application,
and to this effect the previous consortium has been extended to
include the University of Barcelona and the Institute of Marine
Biology in Crete. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Since March 1994, the department has conducted
a joint research study on sonar mapping and localization with the </font><a
href="http://www.cs.nps.navy.mil/research/auv/"><font size="3">Naval
Postgraduate School</font></a><font size="3"> in Monterey, Ca.
The study is based on real data collected through a
high-frequency pencil beam profiling sonar (Tritech ST-1000) and
is aimed at reconstructing a 2-D map of the operating environment in
the case of known sonar position. The study has been integrated
with a method for localizing the sonar in the case of a
well-known environment and satisfactory results have also been
reached in the operational case of partially known environments.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1994 ROBY2 was successfully deployed on
another scientific mission in collaboration with Genoa
University&#146;s Institute of Zoology. The research program,
which received funding from the Ministry of Agriculture, involved
a survey of deep-sea red coral in the Ligurian Sea. The mission
has spotlighted vehicle features and functions that will need to be
enhanced in order to improve performance for this kind of
application. Future additions will include miniature sampling
systems for sea water and bottom, as well as grasping devices for
biological and geological sampling.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">A new UUV prototype, named </font><a
href="/robotics/vehicle.htm#ROMEO"><font size="3">ROMEO</font></a><font
size="3">, is currently being developed. After ROBY2&#146;s
successful mission in Antarctica, it was decided that the vehicle
should be devoted to scientific applications in pools and in the Mediterranean,
rather than being further upgraded. As the architecture adopted
for the earlier vehicles has proved highly effective, ROMEO will
maintain the same approach but will be equipped with several
innovative features designed to overcome the limitations
encountered so far. </font></p>
