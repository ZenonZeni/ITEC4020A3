Individual Investors is an independent, not-for profit corporation that
was formed in 1978 to assist individuals in becoming effective
managers of their own investments. <P>

AAII achieves this aim through publications, nationwide seminars, home study texts, educational videos, and local chapters that focus on investing and investment techniques. Current membership is 170,000.<P>

The AAII Journal is the primary benefit of membership. It is published 10 times a year. The focus is on providing information and how-to articles that help the individual learn investment fundamentals. The Journal does not promote a specific viewpoint or recommend specific investments, and it does not accept advertising.<P>

In addition, each March every member receives a new edition of "The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds," a reference book providing data on over 800 no-load and low-load mutual funds. The Guide includes tables of funds categorized by investment objective and ranked by return for various investment periods. An extensive summary of each fund includes performance data and fund descriptions.<P>

AAII also holds seminars across the country taught by university finance professors on the topics of stock analysis, financial planning, retirement and estate planning, bonds, mutual funds, portfolio management and the fundamentals of investing.<P>

AAII sponsors over 60 local chapters throughout the U.S. AAII members organize presentations given by investment professionals. AAII members who are interested in attending these meetings also benefit from talking to like-minded members.<P>

Membership in AAII is $49 a year and includes a subscription to the AAII Journal, "The Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds," a yearly tax planning guide (published in mid-November), and reduced fees for its seminars and educational publications. <P>
