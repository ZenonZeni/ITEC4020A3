        <h2>Information </h2>
        <h3>Co-Curricular Program </h3>
        <p>Healthy, fun after school activities are good for all
        children. To deaf children, they can mean much more. </p>
        <p>For deaf children to prosper in the broader world,
        they need more than the academic and communication skills
        described thus far. Developing other interests and
        talents, important to any child, particularly helps with
        a deaf child's transition to the mainstream. </p>
        <p>St. Joseph's broadens its students' lives with a
        diverse co-curricular program of after school activities.
        These activities offer youngsters exercise, develop new
        interests, stimulate creativity and provide an important
        release from an intense day at school. </p>
        <p>The program is open to all students, providing an
        extra opportunity for day and resident students to
        interact outside of class. It also offers a quality
        after-care option to working parents. </p>
        <p>The activities contained in the program include clubs,
        sports, and hobbies. </p>
        <h4>Clubs </h4>
        <p>Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs for all ages are
        conducted throughout the school year. They offer the
        traditional Scouting activities, in meetings and off
        campus events. In the Mission Club, upper school students
        gain awareness of the needs of others in the community,
        and they plan activities and fund-raisers to reach out
        and help their neighbors. The Drama Club offers creative
        expression in mime, make up, acting, improvisation and
        monologues, all culminating in a Spring performance. </p>
        <h4>Sports </h4>
        <p>Youngsters have the opportunity to play a variety of
        sports on organized teams and/or in their own backyard or
        gym. SJI students participate in soccer, volleyball,
        basketball and track leagues. In many cases, they play on
        or against teams which have both hearing and deaf
        children. Individual sports such as golf, tennis,
        swimming and ice skating are also part of the program. </p>
        <h4>Hobbies </h4>
        <p>Trained volunteers and staff lead or teach activities
        such as dance, music, art, magic, aerobics, gardening,
        collecting and martial arts. </p>
