<B>Dr. Ravi Sandhu</B> established a new Laboratory for Information Security
Technology (LIST) which he heads as the Director. LIST's mission is to provide
dedicated computing and networking facilities for experimental research
in Information Security. LIST computers logically reside on a subnet within
the GMU Internet. Currently the LIST subnet consists of SUN workstations
and NCD X-terminals. Plans to incorporate Windows NT, Novell, Windows 95
and Macintosh computers are in progress. Please see the story on <A HREF="laboratory-for-informati.html">LIST</A>.<BR>
