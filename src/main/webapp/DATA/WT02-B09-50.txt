<h2>History</h2>







<B>Total Wellness®  is published by Rutherford Publishing, Inc., which is part of a family of companies dedicated to helping people reach their full potential. Paul J. Meyer founded the first company, Success Motivation Institute, Inc. (SMI), in 1960. SMI is the world's largest producer of programs on personal goal setting, sales management, time management, sales training, and management training. All of the SMI programs and courses, which are translated into 17 languages and sold in more than 60 countries, are based on the Total Person Concept™ . The Total Person Concept™ , which focuses on the six areas of life that together make up the total person, was established by Paul J. Meyer 35 years ago. The Total Person Concept™  developed into the Total Wellness®  newsletter in September, 1993, when Rutherford Publishing, Inc. joined the Paul J. Meyer family of  more than 40 companies.











<h2>Concept</h2>

Meyer more than 35 years ago and applied to over 20 full-length personal and professional improvement programs and courses. The Total Person Concept™  focuses on the six areas of life that together make up the total person. Through Total Wellness® , Rutherford Publishing, Inc. encourages individuals to set personal goals and take action in all of the key areas of life which make up the total person.<P>

Other topics include improving doctor/patient relations; balancing work and home life; preventing minor and major illnesses like heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and diabetes; simple guidelines for safety, including seat belts, job safety issues, and home accident prevention; and tips for quitting smoking, reducing stress, building self-esteem, and recognizing the signs of substance abuse. 







<h2>Content/Selection Process</h2>







A concentrated effort is made by the editorial staff at Rutherford Publishing, Inc. to review and summarize the latest in wellness information and research. Rutherford Publishing, Inc. uses reliable resource materials, includes a variety of topics each month, and always encourages readers to share suggestions for articles they would like to see in the newsletter. Rutherford Publishing, Inc. realizes the importance of reader input and offers a 24-hour suggestion hotline for readers to call and leave their topic suggestions. <p>







Total Wellness®  is written to appeal to everyone within an organization no matter what their position. It is written in a positive, non-judgmental style with a mixture of humor and non-threatening technical terms. All articles and illustrations are original and designed to inform, educate, motivate and entertain.<p>







Total Wellness®   contains current information that is pertinent to readers. The majority of articles include step-by-step suggestions on how a person can take positive actions in their own life toward total wellness. The articles are well-researched and sources are cited for most information. Rutherford Publishing, Inc. follows the Health Observances and Recognition calendar published by the American Society for Health Care Marketing and Public Relations of the American Hospital Association.

Total Wellness®  always strives to maintain optimum use of print space and include at least one illustration per page.<p>







Topics for Total Wellness®  evolve from careful, ongoing research and planning by the managing editor and chief editor. Before developing the topic list and writing each issue, the editorial staff has a pre-issue briefing to discuss and brainstorm ideas and current developments in wellness. Each topic is weighed according to its contribution to the Total Person Concept™. Total Wellness®  focuses on providing people with the facts and motivation to become better informed about and take more responsibility for their own health.
