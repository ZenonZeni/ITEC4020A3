<H1 ALIGN=center>Chemistry in Australia. Book Reviews.</H1>

<P><IMG SRC="/pictures/linerain.gif">

<P>The "Chemistry in Australia" Book Reviews are now edited by Brian
Salter-Duke and Naseem Peerzada from the Northern Territory University.

<P><H2>New interface for seeking prospective reviewers.</H2>
<P>We want as much as possible to carry out correspondence with reviewers
and to seek reviews using the internet. If you are willing to review books,
please send us some details <A HREF="interest.html">via a special forms
interface</A> or send e-mail to the Book Review account 
<A HREF="mailto:raci@lacebark.ntu.edu.au"> raci@lacebark.ntu.edu.au</A>,
giving an indication of the type of book you would like to 
receive. Alternatively fax us on 08-89410460 or phone 08-89466702 
(Brian) or 08-89466360 (Naseem). The forms interface is now the prefered
method.

<P><H2>RACI-BOOKS - a new e-mail list for reviewers</H2>
<P>We have developed an e-mail list for everyone interesting in reviewing 
books. You can request subscription to the list from the forms interface
mentioned above. The list will be moderated by the book review editors
but general comments on book reviewing, of interest to all reviewers,
are welcome. The editor of "Chemistry in Australia" will also be a
subscriber to the list. When we get books we will send out details 
to the list in order to seek reviewers. Of course we will also continue the
previous editor's practice of just selecting reviewers in some cases. 

<P><H2>List messages to web page - NEW!</H2>
<P>The list has another special feature. All messages are automatically
added to a web page using software called "hypermail". 
<A HREF="archive/index.html">Click here to enter this page</A> to read 
all the messages. This means you do not have to keep the e-mail
messages you receive. You can always read them over the web!<P>

reviewers (None listed here before!):-</H2>
