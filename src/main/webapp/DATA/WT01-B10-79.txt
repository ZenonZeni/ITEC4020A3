This is the auto-blurb thing you get when yousubscribe to the list.  I think it
should answer any questions that anyone out there has.

Subject:      You have been added to the WITSENDO list<br>

You have been  added to the WITSENDO mailing list  (ENDOmetriosis Treatment and
Support) by John Bullock
<p>
To send a message to all the people currently subscribed to the list, just send
mail to  WITSENDO@.DARTMOUTH.EDU. This is  called "sending mail  to the
list", because you send mail to a  single address and LISTSERV makes copies for
all     the      people     who      have     subscribed.      This     address
(WITSENDO@DARTMOUTH.EDU) is  also called the "list  address". You must
never try to  send any command to  that address, as it would  be distributed to
all the people who have subscribed. All  commands must be sent to the "LISTSERV
address", LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.BITNET (or  LISTSERV@DARTMOUTH.EDU).
<p>
You may leave the  list at any time by sending a  "SIGNOFF WITSENDO" command to
LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.BITNET  (or  LISTSERV@DARTMOUTH.EDU). You  can  also
tell LISTSERV how  you want it to  confirm the receipt of messages  you send to
the list. If you  do not trust the system, send a  "SET WITSENDO REPRO" command
and LISTSERV  will send you a  copy of your own  messages, so that you  can see
that the message  was distributed and did  not get damaged on the  way. After a
while  you may  find that  this is  getting annoying,  especially if  your mail
program does not tell you that the message is from you when it informs you that
new mail has  arrived from WITSENDO. If  you send a "SET  WITSENDO ACK NOREPRO"
command, LISTSERV  will mail  you a short  acknowledgement instead,  which will
look different in your mailbox directory. With most mail programs you will know
immediately that  this is an acknowledgement  you can read later.  Finally, you
can turn off acknowledgements completely with "SET WITSENDO NOACK NOREPRO".
<p>
Contributions sent to this list are  automatically archived. You can get a list
of  the available  archive  files by  sending an  "INDEX  WITSENDO" command  to
LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.BITNET  (or  LISTSERV@DARTMOUTH.EDU). You  can  then
order these  files with a "GET  WITSENDO LOGxxxx" command, or  using LISTSERV's
database  search  facilities.   Send  an  "INFO  DATABASE"   command  for  more
information on the latter.
<p>
Please note that it is presently possible for anybody to determine that you are
signed up to  the list through the  use of the "REVIEW"  command, which returns
the e-mail  address and name of  all the subscribers.  If you do not  want your
name to be visible, just issue a "SET WITSENDO CONCEAL" command.
<p>
More information  on LISTSERV commands can  be found in the  LISTSERV reference
card,  which  you  can  retrieve  by  sending  an  "INFO  REFCARD"  command  to
LISTSERV@DARTCMS1.BITNET (or LISTSERV@DARTMOUTH.EDU).
