REGULATORY DISCUSSION A MUST FOR ELECTRONIC BANKING

     Confront home banking regulatory issues now or risk losing your
ability to influence lawmakers, said speakers at last week's  Emerging
Law of Cyberbanking conference here.
     Unless bankers are proactive and cooperate with regulators now to
solve issues, such as whether chip-card transactions are cash or check
exchanges, "it will be decided when a member of Congress loses a chip
card or stored value card with $1,000 on it," warned Karen Petrou,
president of ISD/Shaw Inc. consultancy in Washington, D.C.
     Although the industry ignored legislators last year, when asked
for suggestions about regulating electronic banking, a few rulings,
opinions and real life experiences exist to guide you.

SFNB Operates Within Existing Law

     Banks could copy Security First Network Bank (SFNB) of Pineville,
Ky., without a major investment in regulatory applications or
challenges, said Stuart Stein, a partner in the financial institutions
practice group with Hogan & Hartson law firm in Washington, D.C. 
Stein's firm advises SFNB on banking law applicable to its new
business strategies.
     SFNB found that it could be the first to offer Internet banking
without applying for a new charter or filing a separate Federal
Reserve application, he said.
     Initially, Cardinal BancShares, SFNB's parent company, received
approval to consolidate and sell five branches to spin-off SFNB.  But
it did not need Regulation Y approval from the Federal Reserve.  Reg Y
applies to bank and non-bank holding company expansion, Stein
explained.
     After the spinoff, SFNB changed its business from traditional
thrift activities to soliciting deposits and purchasing loans over the
Internet, Stein said.  The bank opened its Internet doors last year
and recently expanded its offerings to include joint checking
accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposits and check
imaging to view cleared checks on-line (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 3.)
     The next step for SFNB may require more regulatory involvement. 
The bank plans to buy Five Paces Software and then license the
technology platform on which SFNB was built, Stein said.  Licensing
this technology to other banks likely will be considered a new
business practice for SFNB, which will require Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and Office of Thrift Supervision approval, he
added.
     The Five Paces technology, which includes a secure operating
system that resides at the bank, was created for SFNB by WebTech Inc. 
of Atlanta, an affiliate of Atlanta-based SecureWare. 
     SFNB is not alone in its strategy.  Several banks joined last
year to buy Meca Software from H&R Block and plan to license Mec' home
banking program to other banks.

Two Agencies Publish Rules

     Clearly, the SFNB experience shows that banks can deliver any
previously offered service electronically without receiving any
regulatory grief.  But two agencies have published opinions and rules
on electronic banking regulation.
     The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published a rules'
revision Feb. 9 supporting activities, such as those proposed by SFNB
and Meca.  The revision of part 7 of the OCC regulations states that
banks may market technology they acquired or developed for banking
purposes to third parties, said Julie Williams, chief OCC counsel (see
box, p. 3).
     The FDIC recently released two letters written in October
addressing a bank's questions about Internet banking deposit insurance
and the possible deposit broker role of third-party vendors.  The
opinions can be applied to the industry as a whole.
     One letter addresses customer funds transferred to an account
established at a bank by the sponsoring company to facilitate Internet
transactions.  The FDIC said that federal deposit insurance would flow
through to funds deposited in a third-party agency account with the
insured institution.  Insurance flows through if the company
sufficiently disclosed the capacities in which money was transmitted
to it by customers and that the company maintained adequate records
indicating the identity of customers for which it held funds.
     This approach appears to differ significantly from the approach
used by Mark Twain Bank in its DigiCash trial.  In that system, funds
are deposited directly with the bank into an insured account.  The
money becomes uninsured when withdrawn and placed into the bank's e-
cash mint, or transferred onto the hard drive of a customer's
computer, said Thomas Vartanian, managing partner of the Washington,
D.C. law office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.
     The second FDIC letter concludes that a sponsoring company or
third-party vendor in an Internet funds transfer program would not be
a deposit broker.
     That opinion was based on the fact that the company's "primary
purpose" was the provision of electronic payment system, rather than
the placement of funds with a depository institution.  Since no
interest was being paid on the agency account, the FDIC obviously
understood that the safety and soundness concerns articulated by
Section 29 of the FDI Act were not applicable in this case, Vartanian
said.
    Be aware, though, that the main exclusion for this FDIC ruling,
"primary purpose," is considered on a case-by-case basis.  The FDIC
considers the following key characteristics when asked if an agency is
a deposit broker:

*   Fees.  Does the party receive fees from the bank for placing funds
with the institution?

*  Purpose.  Would the relationship have been established but for the
purpose for placing funds in the bank?

*   Other Reasons.  Is there any other substantial purpose for the
activity or business other than the placement of funds in the insured
institution?

Think About Product First

    "Regulatory analysis can vary depending on what you're talking
about," said Scott Anenberg, partner and chair of the financial
institutions group at the Washington, D.C., law firm Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge.  Legal issues differ whether you're just taking
deposits or doing loans over the Internet, he said.
    Decide what the product is, how it will be offered, who will be
offering it and who is the target market before investigating
regulatory options, Anenberg said.
    Also, speakers said, consider the competition, which may not
always be another bank.  In the smart card market, for example,
Florida-based Blockbuster Entertainment Group  [VIA] is working on a
pilot and creating set-top box applications.  (Scott Anenberg, Shaw,
Pittman, 202/663-8000; Karen Petrou, ISD/Shaw, 202/296-5240; Julie
Williams, OCC, 202/874-5770; Thomas Vartanian, Fried, Frank, 202/639-
7016.) 

Specifics of OCC Revision

     The Office of the Comptroller (OCC) of the currency, last week, 
released revisions to Part 7 of its interpretive letters.  The final
rule:

*   Modernizes bank data processing rules to recognize bank
involvement in the area of electronic money.  A national bank may
perform, provide or deliver, through electronic means or facilities,
any activity, function, product or service that it is now authorized
to perform, provide or deliver.
  
*   States that a national bank may market and sell excess capacity in
electronic activities to third-parties for uses not related to
banking.

*   Clarifies that some lending activities must be completed at bank's
main office or branch.  A bank loan recipient must appear in-person at
the bank's main office or at a  branch to collect funds.  Loan
origination, approval and disbursal of loan proceeds by third parties
need not be performed at a main office or branch.

*   Defines interest to include fees for late payments, insufficient
funds, annual banking services and cash advances.  The fees can be
applied across state lines as with credit cards. 

*   Defines rules regarding banks' ability to lease excess space,
share space and share employees with businesses other than other
financial institutions.  

*   Provides national banks with added flexibility to structure their
procedures governing board and shareholder actions by permitting the
reliance on recognized complete bodies of corporate law and state laws
where the bank's main office is located.

*   Updates letter of credit provisions to reflect current industry
practices and to cover a broader category of transactions that are the
functional equivalent of letters of credit.

GROCERY STORES PROVING POPULAR BANKING VENUE

    Branch location will continue to play a central role in the
customer relationship, even as on-line banking and smart card delivery
channels become more popular, banking analysts predict (RDSN, Jan. 19,
p. 3.).  But the size, location and services offered at branches will
change, analysts say.
    In-store branches and mini-branches for grocery chains are two
alternative strategies to brick and mortar branches emerging in the
industry.  Last year, the number of in-store branch locations
increased 25 percent and now stands at more than 3,000, according to
International Banking Technologies (IBT) of Norcross, Ga., an in-store
branch consulting company.  These branches average 400 to 800 square
feet and are staffed with several bank employees.
    Mini-branches are the newest solution emerging as a tool to reach
busy consumers, said IBT's President John Garnett.  Mini-branches
range in size from 35 square feet to 100 square feet and are automated
with self-service loan and teller machines and video conferencing
modules.  The mini-branch is staffed by one or two employees, he said.
     Mini-branches have greater space devoted to automated and self-
service delivery, freeing specialized staff to make one-on-one
contacts in the supermarket aisles, Garnett said.  "We think this will
fill the gap in stores that are too-tight for a full branch," he
added. 
     IBT is finalizing its mini-branch prototype, which has yet to be
tested at a store, Garnett said.

Success Story

     One bank that has contributed significantly to the increasing
number of in-store branches is First State Bank of Austin, Texas. 
     The $415 million-asset institution operates a total of 16 in-
store branches at Wal Mart Supercenters and Kmarts, covering a more
than 1,200 miles between Midland, Texas and Corpus Christi, Texas. 
Five additions are planned this year, said Joseph Long, First State
chairman.
     The bank, which trained employees to roam Wal Mart aisles and
discuss loans with customers, has experienced loan volumes double that
of what was expected.  Deposit volumes also are higher than predicted
at the in-store branches, he said.
    "It's the repeat business in the grocery market, I think, that
makes [in-store branches] work as well as they do," Long said. 
Studies indicate that the average American visits the grocery store
two to three times a week.  Those numbers do not include the
additional reasons why consumers might visit Wal Mart SuperCenters,
which often house opticians and unisex hair salons.  A supercenter
conducts 30,000 to 60,000 transactions daily, Long said.
    First State has been able to increase its market coverage at a
fraction of the cost, Long added.  Stand-alone brick and mortar banks
cost $1 million or more to build compared to the $260,000 price tag
for an in-store mini-branch, he said.
    In-store branches can be created for as little as $175,000. Mini-
branches will fall under that figure because rent and staffing
requirements are even less, Garnett said.
    In-store banking provides many benefits for banks, Garnett said:

*   High-touch delivery channels.  The channel  fosters sales,
allowing automation to handle routine transactions similar to IBT's
mini-branch model.

*   Merger and Acquisition Tool.  In-store branching makes it feasible
for acquiring banks to maintain a presence in key markets when
traditional locations are closed to maximize efficiency.

*   Opportunities to build market share.  Banks can move into new
market areas without as much capital investment as with traditional
branch expansion.  For example, all but one of the Wal Mart branches
opened by First State Bank is in a new market area for the bank, Long
said.  Additionally, the inexpensive branch is a tool for community
banks to ward off competition from larger banks.

*   Increased customer service.  The in-store branch is open longer
and located where consumers must go anyway.  It allows bankers to
maintain face-to-face contact even in the evening hours.  The branches
also can provide services similar to brokerage firms.

Consumer Attitudes Positive

    National Commerce Bank Services Inc. (NCBS) of Memphis, Tenn., an
in-store branching consultancy, recently predicted that the number of
in-store branches will reach 7,500 by the year 2000.  NCBS recently
interviewed about 800 shoppers in 20 states who said in-store banking
is important to them and that the branch should offer more than just
deposit and withdrawal services.  The study revealed that of those
interviewed:

*   93 percent consider in-store bank very important;

*   70 percent shop more frequently at the supermarket because of
branch access;

*   79 percent would use the in-store bank at least once a week and
more than 80 percent would visit the store just for banking
activities; and

*   About 40 percent said the in-store branch should add home equity
loans, personal loans, safe deposit boxes and money market/mutual fund
services.

    Two U.S. consulting companies specialize in advising banks on
creating in-store branches.  Pricing for the services vary according
to the number of in-store branches needed, the mixture of bank-
provided and vendor-provided materials and whether the firm has a
relationship with the grocery store, Garnett said.
    IBT is a business unit of First Data Corporation of Hackensack,
N.J., offering a solution called Sales Platform, which has been
adopted by more than 250 U.S. banks and 950 in-store grocery branches,
Wal Marts and Kmarts.  Customers include The State Bank and Union Bank
in Central Valley, California.  NCBS is the consulting division of
National Commerce Bancorporation, which has placed 62 of its 77
branches inside supermarkets.  NCBS has advised more than 200 banks in
developing 600 in-store branches.  Customers include newly signed on
SunTrust Banks of Atlanta. (Douglas Ferris, NCBS, 800/264-2609; John
Garnett, IBT, 770/381-2023; Joseph Long, First State Bank, 512/495-
1000.)

VISA CASH BENEFITS STILL UNPROVEN

     The Visa Cash division of Visa International is betting that it
can divert some of the nation's $1.8 trillion in annual cash
transactions under $10 into Visa Cash exchanges. Visa believes these
transactions are under the limit for which most people will use a
credit card.
     The banking industry has been awash with big ideas about smart
cards that will hold all of a consumer's vital information, from
medical records to cash transactions.
But Visa Cash stored-value card is designed to be simple and to help
consumers get over technology hurdles, said Mary Buckley, Visa's vice
president of stored value products.  Visa proposes to operate Visa
Cash on its existing VisaNet system and charge a fee for processing
transactions.
      For banks, the card is a vehicle to put its name in consumer
hands, an additional customer service and a fee generator, Buckley
said.
     But the service will require substantial upgrades in
automated teller machines' (ATMs) hardware and software and changes in
merchant point-of-sale equipment, said Basil Bromberg, president of
Smart Cards USA consultancy in Dallas.  "Change-over of equipment out
in the field to support this card is going to be a multimillion dollar
effort."
    Additionally, the VisaNet system limits Visa Cash consumers to
the same merchants where they could use a credit card, Bromberg said. 
He criticized Visa for failing to offer enough information to help
banks to make decisions about implementing the Visa Cash system.
    Indeed, when asked about pricing and profitability potential,
Buckley directed inquiries to each individual bank partner.  But she
acknowledged that, like the credit industry, smart cards may bring
more profits to the issuing banks that earn interest on funds through
float or unused cards funds.  Acquiring banks, on the other hand, can
earn merchant transaction fees.
    Visa Cash is in the pilot stages.  The 1996 Summer Olympics
pilot, for example, will provide many answers to industry questions
about smart card consumer acceptance, profitability and feasibility. 
"There's a lot of work to be done to validate the benefits.  When the
tents are down and the athletes have gone home, we'll still be in
Atlanta,"  Buckley said.
    Visa, at least seems to be ahead of its competition.  MasterCard
is developing a smart card system but has no pilots, Bromberg said. 
American Express initiated a pilot at its headquarters in December. 
The cards, issued to less than 50 employees, contain credit functions
on a chip, but no cash applications, said spokesman Toby Usnik. (Basil
Bromberg, Smart Cards USA, 214/991-6502; Toby Usnik, American Express,
212/640-5060.)

Australia, accepted by about 1,000 merchants.  In Atlanta, Visa Cash
partnered with several banks to issue cards in association with the
1996 Summer Olympics.  In the Atlanta pilot, First Union teamed with
at least 12 merchants to accept Visa Cash.  In April, Visa launched a
stored-value card system for employees at its headquarters.  The $20
cards are used in the cafeteria and vending machines.

MASTERCARD, VISA SET STANDARDS. 

    Debit and credit payments over the Internet received a boost
recently when card-association giants MasterCard and Visa scrapped
their competing Internet security protocols and backed a uniform
security standard.  The companies believe the new protocol will make
the Internet safe for commerce, but consumer adaptation may be further
behind.  "I don't think their announcement is going to do very much
for the progress or the pace at which the mass market adopts the
Internet as a viable channel for commercial or retail enterprise,"
says Mark Hardie, an analyst with The Tower Group, in Wellesley, Mass. 
"It's a complicated issue and there's more to it than simply
MasterCard and Visa agreeing that they'll use the same standard."  The
larger issue is whether consumers will flock to the Internet as they
flock to suburban malls, he said.  The standard, called Secure
Electronic Transaction (SET), combines features from MasterCard's
Secure Electronic Payment Protocol and Visa's Secure Transaction
Technology.  The protocol underlying SET is software-based public key
cryptography from Redwood City, Calif.-based RSA Data Security.  It is
the same technology that MasterCard and Visa were using separately,
which software vendors say they're able to support simultaneously. 
The question remains whether software-based public key encryption is
an adequate form of security.  "It's better than nothing," says Bob
Gargus, president of Atalla Corp., the San Jose, Calif.-based division
of Tandem Computer Corp..  Atalla manufacturers hardware-based
encryption devices for automated teller machines and is offering 
peripherals for client-server systems to secure Internet-based
commerce (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 6).  Standard specifications are to be
available in a few weeks and operational by the fourth quarter.  (Bob
Gargus, Atalla, 408/435-5342; Mark Hardie, The Tower Group, 617/235-

UBANK ON-LINE GETS GOOD REVIEW.

    US Bancorp of Portland, Ore., says that 85 percent of their
customers are satisfied with its UBANK ON-line home banking product
and 95 percent would recommend it to friends.  A survey of about 20
percent of UBANK users also revealed that 88 percent prefer banking
on-line to manual methods and customers especially like the feature
that allows them to download account information directly into their
personal finance software.  U.S. Bancorp has been offering home
banking through Microsoft Money for about two years and recently added
access through Intuit's Quicken.  (Linda Parker, U.S. Bancorp,

CYBERCASH, VERISIGN PARTNER. 

    CyberCash Inc., of Reston Va., a provider of secure Internet
Payment systems, and Redwood City-Calif.-based Verisign Inc., digital
authentication vendor, plan to work together to promote the use of
digital certificates for on-line transactions.  The CyberCash Wallet
now will store Verisigns' digital identifications for secure payment. 
Digital IDs are the equivalent of a digital driver's license to
authenticate a consumers identity to banks and on-line merchants.  The
CyberCash Wallet holds credit card numbers and the digital ID.  In
other CyberCash news, the American Institute for Financial Research
(AIFR) of Chapel Hill, N.C., said it will be the first Windows-based
software company to sell its products over the World Wide Web with
CyberCash's system.  AIFR also will be First Union National Bank's
first CyberCash merchant.  (Marshall Behling, VeriSign, 415/961-7500;

MICROSOFT TRANSACTS WITH VISA

    As RDSN went to press, Microsoft and Visa Interactive revealed
they are working together to offer banks a turnkey remote banking
solution.  Under the agreement, Visa Interactive will act as a
processor for Microsoft's personal finance software, Money.  The more
than 30 banks offering Money have been processing payments through 
Intuit Services Corp. (ISC), also the processor for Intuit's [INTU]
personal finance software, Quicken. 
    The processing arrangement, expected to be approved by Visa
International next month, apparently offers a choice of processors for
banks that provide personal finance software from either Microsoft or
Intuit, said Mark Hardie, technology analyst with the Tower Group in
Wellesley, Mass., who received a pre-announcement briefing from
Microsoft and Visa.
    Being forced to process transactions through ISC, rather than the
bank's usual processor or a new one chosen by the bank, has been a
common complaint among banks offering the Intuit and Microsoft
programs.  The ISC contract is often the second or third processing
arrangement banks must enter into to offer personal finance software.

Microsoft Strategy

    The Visa partnership may help Microsoft improve its relationship
with the banking industry, which fears the software giant will become
a major competitor.
    When Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates spoke to about 6,000 bankers
at the Bank Administration Institute 's Retail Delivery '95 in
December, he promised bankers future processing choices for home
banking.  Microsoft likely will keep its ISC relationship for banks
that want to use that processor, Hardie said.  "I don't think
Microsoft would be as successful going to banks directly and telling
the banks to set up their own payment systems," he added.
    Additionally, the Visa choice may provide a new comfort level for
bankers who fear Microsoft, but are familiar with the Visa, Hardie
said.
    Microsoft's challenge is to keep Money competitive among Internet
banking and payment strategies, Hardie said.  Several competitors,
including ISC, are creating products for Internet banking.
    It's too early to say how the partnership will affect ISC, which
has been the exclusive Money and Quicken processor by default, ISC's
Chairman Bruce Burchfield told RDSN.  ISC will not disclose its
transaction volume numbers until Intuit's quarterly report is
published next month.
    It is unlikely that the larger banks, already processing with
ISC, will change to Visa because they would have to create a new
interface to replace one that already exists, Burchfield said.
    Indeed, the Microsoft/Visa turnkey system will likely be most
attractive to smaller banks that do not have the resources to invest
in development, Hardie said.  (Bruce Burchfield, ISC, 415/944-3569;
Mark Hardie, Tower Group, 617/235-5777; Greg Jones, Visa, 415/432-
2752.)
