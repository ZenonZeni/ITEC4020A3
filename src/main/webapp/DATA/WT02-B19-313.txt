<CENTER><B>Urge Your Senator to Reauthorize IDEA This Year!!</B><BR>
<B>It may be put off until next year unless Congress hears from you!</B>  <BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<BR>
All of us in the special education field know how important the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is to ensuring that the rights of students with exceptionalities are upheld.  However, there are some members of the Senate that may not be aware of this law's great importance -- that this law provides the foundation through which the basic principles of educating students with disabilities are preserved.<P>
Because of the lack of knowledge, an enduring budget crisis, pressing legislation, and a shortened congressional schedule due to the election this year, there is a real possibility that the reauthorization of IDEA may be delayed until next year.  While Part B of IDEA that contains the State grant program and the preschool program is permanently authorized, the rest of the programs under IDEA need to be reauthorized.  The authorization for the discretionary programs expired in 1994 but was automatically extended for a year.  Without reauthorization or an extention, these programs could face an elimination of funding in the coming fiscal year.  Furthermore, critical improvements needed in Part B and other parts of IDEA would be put off for at least another year.<P>
Although staffers from the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources insist that an official reauthorizing bill will be introduced by the end of this month, they're indicating that although they've heard from the field regarding a variety of issues surrounding IDEA (discipline, IEPs, funding formulas, etc.) -- they have not gotten messages from us regarding the importance of reauthorizing the law THIS YEAR.  <P>
For those of you who have Senators that reside on the Committee, please rally your networks to contact these 16 Senators over the next few weeks and URGE THEM TO COMPLETE REAUTHORIZATION THIS YEAR!!  We need to stress that the reauthorization process has been delayed for a year already; delaying it further sends a message that the safeguards that are grounded in IDEA are simply not important.  The members of the Senate Committee are as follows:<P>

<CENTER><B>Help Save Education From Unprecedented Cuts!!!!</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
As the attached CAN-O-GRAM points out, programs that are funded by the FY 1996 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill have been existing from continuing resolution (CR) to CR, wondering under what sort of funding parameters they would be working.  This type of unsteady funding pattern -- not knowing what funding levels the programs will be operating under during the next CR -- does not allow these programs to operate at their full potential.<P>
<B>IN FACT</B>, the current CR, if extended through the entire fiscal year, represents a cut of approximately $3.1 billion for education programs -- the largest cut in education in history!!!  For IDEA programs, the cut would be equal to $40 million, or a cut of 13% in IDEA discretionary funds!!  <P>
We have until <B>March 15</B> (when the current CR expires) to stop these unprecedented cuts from going into effect for the full year.  The President and members of Congress NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU AND YOUR CAN NETWORKS -- tell them that the cuts to education funding are UNACCEPTABLE, and stress that an adequate investment in education should be of the <U>highest priority</U>!!! <P>

<CENTER></U>LEGISLATIVE UPDATE<U><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The 4th Continuing Resolution and More Horror Stories<P>
     </B></U>On January 26, the Congress passed and the President signed legislation to extend appropriations for Departments that have not yet had appropriations bills signed into law.  Under the 4th Continuing Resolution (CR) programs under the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education are required to receive funding at the House passed level or the FY 1995 level, whichever is lower.  With the exception of 10 education programs that both the President and Congress had proposed eliminating, no program can receive less than 75 percent of the FY 1995 level.  Funding is authorized through March 15. The funding cut, if extended through the entire year, represents a cut of approximately $3.1 billion for education programs.  This would be the largest cut in education in history!!<P>
      For IDEA programs, 7 programs that were proposed to be eliminated in the House and were mostly restored by the Senate committee, are cut 25 percent through March 15.  If extended through the entire year, the cut would be equal to $40 million, or a cut of 13 percent in IDEA discretionary funds!  Because of the limit of 25 percent cut, however, the Javits gifted program is funded at $3.7 million under the current CR instead of the proposed House and Senate FY 1996 funding level of $3 million.  For a complete list of IDEA and Javits gifted appropriations, please contact DPP at (703) 264-9498.<P>
     By March 15 another CR must be passed or the education appropriations bill enacted to prevent another shutdown of the Department of Education.  Another deadline that is quickly approaching is March 1st when the federal government will go into default if a bill isn't passed that would raise the debt ceiling, according to the Administration.  It is expected that some limited agreement on appropriations could be attached to a debt ceiling bill.  Thus it is very important for our grassroots to maintain the constant drumbeat on the importance of education funding to Congress and the Administration. <P>
     Because FY 1996 appropriations have not been decided, the time line for the FY 1997 budget process has been severely pushed back.  The President is required by law to submit a budget request for FY 1997 by February 5.  Unfortunately, without the FY 1996 numbers, federal departments have been unable to project necessary spending for FY 1997.  Therefore, instead of a "line-by-line" request for each education programs, the President sent Congress a thematic statement outlining budget priorities.  The President is expected to release a more thorough budget the week of March 18.  Please see related story under EXECUTIVE BRANCH INFORMATION section of this CAN mailing entitled "<B>President's FY '97 Budget Unveiled."</B> <P>
<B><U>Reauthorization of IDEA<P>
</B></U>     Neither the House or the Senate Republicans have introduced a bill to reauthorize the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act.  The Senate is expected to introduce its bill on February 26, mark-up the bill during the month of March, and have the bill through the Senate by Memorial Day.  The House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities have not yet set a schedule for the reauthorization.<P>
     It is very important that the reauthorization of IDEA is done this year.  The authorization for IDEA discretionary programs was originally extended for a year and have now expired.  Particularly in the Senate, there is increasing concern that the reauthorization will be put off again as other pressing matters demand congressional attention.  In order to move ahead with the many improvements we would like to see in special education, CEC strongly urges Congress to reauthorize IDEA this year  (please see<B> attached Alert</B>).  The House Committee is still planning to link IDEA reauthorization legislation with a controversial education reform consolidation grant proposal.  This may delay reauthorization in the House.  CEC believes the reauthorization of IDEA has always been bipartisan in nature and that it should move through Congress quickly and independently.<P>
     Stay tuned for more information on the latest version on the reauthorization.  We will let you know as soon as possible when any new drafts (or actual bills!!) come our way.  In the meantime, please use the December CAN mailing side-by-side attachment for a comparison of the Administration bill, the Senate draft, the House draft, and CEC's position.  <BR>

Hearing on "What Works in Public Schools"<P>
</B></U>     On January 31, the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities held a hearing on "What Works in Public Schools".  The hearing was held to highlight the positive results of public education.  Chairman Goodling (R-PA) began the hearing by contending that too often Congress hears what is not working in public schools and he wanted to hear what was working.  He went on to state that the most important ingredients for a successful school are quality results and local control.  A strong local commitment to education, high academic expectations, and committed parental involvement are also necessary according to Chairman Goodling.<P>
     Testifying at the hearing were representatives from the Even Start program, a program that Chairman Goodling sponsored, Charter School representatives, the president of the Council for Chief State School Officers and others, that spoke eloquently about the successes they have seen in public education.  The consensus of the speakers echoed the sentiments of Chairman Goodling's initial remarks stressing the need for an emphasis on high standards and community and parental involvement.  A major theme from all of the speakers, however, was the need for continued professional development of our nation's teachers.  <P>
     No further education hearings are scheduled at this time.    <B><U>     <P>
<BR>
Lobbying Reform<P>
     </B></U>The lobbying reform legislation that was passed last year will require more lobbyists to register with the federal government than ever before.  Following are the guidelines you should use in deciding whether you too are a LOBBYIST and need to register:<P>
*     Lobbying firms must register.  A lobbying firm is an entity with one or more employees (including self-employed individuals) who act as lobbyists for outside clients.  A lobbying firm is exempt from registration for a particular client if its total income from that client for lobbying activities does not exceed and is not expected to exceed $5,000 in a semiannual period.<BR>
<BR>
     *     An organization employing in-house lobbyists must also register.  The organization is exempt from registration if its total expenses for lobbying activities do not exceed or are not expected to exceed $20,000 in a semiannual period.<BR>
<BR>
Registration is required no later than 45 days after a lobbyist first makes a lobbying contact or is employed or retained to do so, whichever is earlier.  Registration form LD-1 may be obtained by contacting the Senate Office of Public Records, 232 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC 20510 or calling (202) 224-0758.       <P>
<B><U>ACIR Report on Unfunded Mandates</B></U><P>
     In compliance with the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 passed last year, the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) has released a preliminary report on<I> The Role of Federal Mandates in Intergovernmental Relations</I>.  The ACIR is made up of 24 members including Secretary of Education Richard Riley; Senators Graham (FL), Kempthorne (ID), and Thomas WY); Representatives Moran (VA) and Payne (NJ); Governors Carlson (MN), Dean (VT), Leavitt (UT) and Miller (NV); and others.   <P>
     The report calls for  repealing provisions covering State and local governments in the following laws: <P>
Fair Labor Standards Act                    Family and Medical Leave Act<BR>
Occupational Safety and Health Act               <BR>
Drug and Alcohol Testing of Commercial Drivers<BR>
Metric Conversion for Plans and Specifications       <BR>
Medicaid: Boren Amendment<BR>
Required Use of Recycled Crumb Rubber<P>
     The Commission names the Clean Water Act, IDEA and ADA as other mandates that it finds are necessary because national policy goals justify their use.  However, the ACIR states that the federal share of the costs should be increased or the stringent requirements and deadlines imposed on state and local governments by these mandates should be relaxed.  The ACIR recommends retaining these mandates with modifications to accommodate budgetary and administrative constraints on State and local governments.   Concerning IDEA, the Commission specifically recommends increasing federal funding to the 40 percent authorized level or relieve States from prescriptive and costly administrative mandates.  The Commission further recommends IDEA be modified to remove funding provisions that encourage and reward the over classification and segregation of students with disabilities.  The ACIR further recommends alternative dispute resolution practices should be required, and any court challenge based on the federal law should be brought by State or federal agencies, not by individuals.<P>
     Finally, the ACIR names the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Air Act and Davis-Bacon Related Acts as mandates that are related to acceptable national policy goals but should be revised to provide greater flexibility in implementation procedures and more participation by State and local governments in development of mandate policies.  <P>
     CEC takes issue with some of the report's findings on IDEA.  While we agree that the federal government should live up to its promise of providing States 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for every child eligible under IDEA, we disagree with any proposal that would roll back protections for children with disabilities.  We also believe that the Commission's statements that State and local financial incentives to "label" more students as special education students are driving up the size and cost of the system are completely erroneous.  Finally, using the term "segregation" to define certain settings seems to deny the value and benefits that different placements have in providing children with a free and appropriate and public education.<P>
     We urge you to let the ACIR know what YOU think about its recommendations!!!  The ACIR is accepting public comments on the report's findings until March 15.  Send your comments to: Mr. Philip M. Dearborn, ACIR, Suite 450 South, 800 K Street, NW, Washington, DC 20575.  202/653-5540 (phone), 202/653-5429 (FAX).<P>

<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE BRANCH INFORMATION<U><BR>
</CENTER><P>
President's FY97 Budget Unveiled<P>
</B></U>President Clinton was required by statute to submit a 1997 budget to Congress on February 5.  Usually, such a document is huge, with proposed expenditures for every line item in the government.  Because the 1996 budget is still not complete, and the President hoped to use it as a baseline for calculating his 1997 recommendations, he submitted a brief outline of priorities instead of the usual tome.  He plans to offer his full budget during the week of March 18.<P>
In his outline, the President wrote that his budget has two aims:<P>
&iuml;     to balance the budget in seven years; and<BR>
&iuml;     to "maintain our commitments to economic growth and to protecting the most vulnerable Americans, including senior citizens, working families, and children."<BR>
<BR>
Among the programs affecting children, the President stated his budget will reduce spending on:<P>
&iuml;     Medicaid by $124 billion;<BR>
&iuml;     welfare by $40 billion; and<BR>
&iuml;     discretionary programs by $297 billion.<BR>
<BR>
The President's budget continues to prioritize education and technology.  His outline specifically mentions the importance of investments in Head Start, Safe and Drug-Free Schools, Goals 2000, an educational technology initiative, and Americorp.  The outline also specifies expanding work-study opportunities, charter schools, and merit scholarships.  No specific funding recommendations are listed for these programs in this general document.  According to the U.S. Department of Education, the fact that Title I is not specifically mentioned does not mean that the President intends to diminish this large program, which has been targeted for major cuts in the 1996 Congressional budget.    <P>
CEC is pleased with the President's introduction of merit-based scholarships, an idea unveiled at his recent State of the Union Address to Congress.  These scholarships will serve as an incentive to some high-achieving gifted students and may also encourage some underachievers to strive more diligently.  The Administration also continues to support the reauthorization of IDEA and maintenance of funding.  The fact that it was not specifically mentioned in this document is not seen as a sign of wavering on the part of the President.  <BR>
<B><U><P>
Clinton Vetoes Welfare Bill</B></U><P>
     President Clinton vetoed the compromise welfare reform bill passed by the House and Senate.  The bill originally passed by the Senate would have ended the Federal entitlement to the poor as we know it and block-granted money to states to distribute according to their own guidelines.  The House version (and compromise version) included provisions making it even less palatable to the President, including cuts effecting disabled children, legal immigrants, and food stamp recipients.  Work continues to revise welfare reform in such a way that both Congress and the President will approve.  We'll update you on the status of this very important legislation in upcoming CAN mailings.<P>
<B><U><BR>
California Eliminates Expulsion</B></U><P>
     All too often a school district's response to students who bring weapons or drugs to school or who otherwise endanger themselves and/or others has been to expel the students.  Expulsion is the equivalent of giving up on students.  When CEC began, many students with exceptionalities were given up on and received little or no education.  We don't ever want to have that happen again, for any children.  <P>
     California is taking an approach that may prove to meet the safety needs of schools without denying children the chance to meet their learning needs.  The state is devising alternative programs, so that students aren't expelled onto the streets, but are "expelled" <I>into</I> an alternative educational environment.  Districts are currently developing plans, which should be put into effect over the summer.  While other states and LEAs have devised similar programs, California's will be the largest effort of its kind.<P>
<B><U><BR>
Parent Involvement in Education</B></U><P>
     There is a great deal of talk these days about increasing the connection between parents and schools.  The parents of children with disabilities and/or gifts and talents are well-known (if not always well-loved) for their school involvement.  Look for growing local opportunities to have productive relationships with schools in addition to the PTA.  <P>
     One example of increasing parent focus is <I>Education Today</I>, a parent-oriented newsletter of the Education Publishing Group (EPG). It is distributed to hundreds of thousands of parents around the country.  Its aim is to inform parents about schools and to promote productive collaboration by parents and schools.  A Spanish version of <I>Education Today</I> also has been well received.   <P>
     EPG (with support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Mothers Against Drunk Driving [MADD], Reading Is Fundamental [RIF], American Association of School Administrators [AASA], KIDSNET, and the Challenger Center for Space Science) is in the process of developing a computer network for parents and children.  It will offer online seminars, homework help, organized access to the Internet, educational forums, and more.  For more information about EPG, call them at (617)-542-6564.<BR>
<B><U><BR>
State Vocational & Rehabilitation Services Program</B></U><P>
     The U.S. Department of Education has put out its proposed regulations for state vocational & rehabilitation services programs.  These are based upon changes to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 made by 1992 and 1993 amendments.  This program supports state efforts to run "comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable" programs to "assess, plan, develop, and provide" vocational rehabilitation services to persons with disabilities in order to prepare them for "gainful" employment. The overall goals and some specific regulatory plans are below.  The new regulations are more than 50 pages long, so anyone who wants detailed information should consult the December 15<I> Federal Register</I>.  Public comments are due by February 23.  The proposed regulations are designed to:<P>
&iuml;     increase the influence of persons with disabilities in the development, implementation, and evaluation of state rehabilitation plans;<BR>
&iuml;     ensure that both voc ed training and employment take place in integrated settings to whatever degree this is possible;<BR>
&iuml;     ease the process for determining eligibility for state voc ed programs<BR>
by requiring use of existing information<BR>
by instituting 60-day time limit for eligibility determinations;<BR>
&iuml;     improve and expand the quality of services<BR>
            by requiring state strategic plan<BR>
by requiring a system of personnel development<BR>
by requiring development of standards and indicators for evaluation (to be announced later); and<BR>
&iuml;     expand and improve services to certain groups of persons with disabilities<BR>
 <BR>
     The regulations seek to increase the employment outcomes of education.  An employment outcome is defined as one that is consistent with an individual's "strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice."<BR>
<B><U><BR>
</B></U><BR>
<B><U>Guidebook on Managed Care for People with Developmental Disabilities</B></U><P>
     HSRI (The Human Services Research Institute) and NASDDDS (The National Association of State Directors of Developmental Disabilities) have published a guidebook on managed care.  Managed care systems are increasingly being used to care for Medicaid recipients.  Current Federal plans to limit growth of Medicaid expenses is likely to accelerate this trend.  The guidebook offers an overview of managed care, information about state usage of managed care, and an in-depth exploration on the applications and implications of managed care for people with developmental disabilities.  It also offers suggestions on developing long term support systems within a managed care system.  For further information or to purchase a copy, contact NASDDDS at (703) 683-4202.<P>

<B><U>Regulatory Reform Efforts</B></U><P>
     In 1995, efforts were made in Congress to revamp the government's role in developing and enforcing regulations.  Strategies include cutting back on mandates, limiting the quality or amount of oversight, creating cumbersome processes for writing regulation, or eliminating entirely the departments with oversight responsibilities (including the department of education).  <P>
     Citizens for Sensible Safeguards (CCS), a group of organizations representing citizen interests in education, environmental concerns, and public health and safety, is concerned that some of the proposals would result in limiting public protection.   A number of existing regulations provide safeguards for America's children of today and tomorrow, including:<P>
&iuml;     environmental protection for clean air and water;<BR>
&iuml;     antidiscriminatory laws for those with disabilities as well as those of varying racial or cultural heritage or religious belief;<BR>
&iuml;     safeguards for the food supply and for overseeing the safety of new drugs and treatments; and<BR>
&iuml;     Free Appropriate Public Education and due process for children and youth with disabilities<BR>
<BR>
     Public protection in these areas has widespread popular support, but CCS is concerned that the financial interests of private industry or others may take precedence over public protection in revising federal regulatory safeguards.  Many of these safeguards were developed because any unwise local or state action in these areas would have negative effects far outside its borders.  For example, if some states allowed dumping of waste in rivers (which would be a great financial savings to industry), people downstream would be adversely effected.  Similarly, IDEA provides assurances that students with disabilities will receive an education regardless of where they reside in the U.S.  Local districts could save a great deal of money if IDEA protections were softened or rolled back.  While it is important not to hamper growth through overzealous regulation, it may be useful for CAN members to be attentive to the effects of regulatory reform on protections for the rights of children.   <P>
<B><U><BR>
Proposed Amendments in<I> Projects With Industry</I> Regulations</B></U><P>
     The U.S. Department of Education has posted proposed changes in the Projects With Industry (PWI) program.  PWI is a grant program of the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS).  The goal of this program is to create and expand job opportunities for individuals with disabilities by establishing partnerships between grantees and private industry.  <P>
     The objectives of the revision include clarification of statutory intent, reduction of burden, enhancing accountability, and addressing certain implementation problems.  One of the major revisions involves a new selection criterion focussing on "the extent to which a project has established a working relationship with private industry."  The full text of the revisions can be found in the January 22 <I>Federal Register</I>.  Comments on the proposed revisions are due by March 22.<P>
<B><U><BR>
The National Educational Goals Report, 1995</B></U><P>
     Based upon the 1995 report, it appears that the U.S. will fail to reach any of its eight national educational goals by the year 2000.  Statistically significant improvements are few, and given the large number of analyses, it would be expected that some changes of significant magnitude would occur by chance, regardless of any intervention.  <P>
     The educational goals are broken down to 34 specific objectives.  "Significant" improvements are reported for seven of these objectives, but the probability criteria used for defining "significance" was not specified.  In contrast, the results for another seven of the objectives were "significantly" worse than when baseline data were collected.  For the other objectives, there were no significant changes or no comparative data were available.<P>
     The report also provides data on a state-by-state basis.  Some of the states that appear to be making progress on multiple goals include Colorado, Iowa, Mississippi, and Texas.  Among the states showing disappointing results are Hawaii, Maine, and Wyoming.  <P>
<BR>
<B><U>Personnel Preparation Grants</B></U><P>
     The status of federal monies for personnel preparation is in doubt.  The House has recommended eliminating the program, and the Senate has recommended funding it at the 1995 level.  Meanwhile, potential grant-seekers wonder if and when requests for proposals will be posted.  <P>
     According to a U.S. Department of Education source, they are moving forward internally with preparations for holding the grant competitions.  The process has been somewhat slowed by furloughs and by a desire to hold off competitions until it was determined that there would be money for which to compete.  Given the ongoing budget struggle, the requests for proposals (RFP) may be issued before funding is appropriated.  If competitions are held, the first would be a modified "careers" competition.  This RFP could be issued before the end of February.  The second competition would be in the low incidence area, with an RFP possible before the end of March.  There is no guarantee that either of these competitions will be held, but we remain hopeful. <P>

<CENTER><B>COURT CASES</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
<B><U><BR>
U.S. Supreme Courts Refuses to Review Civil Rights Case</B></U> <BR>
     The Supreme Court, by refusing to hear a case involving an alleged civil rights offense against a student with cerebral palsy, upheld a lower court ruling that the school had not taken any official action to deny the student her rights.  The case involved a girl who was seriously injured while attempting gymnastics moves in a physical education class.  The school was accused of not providing adequately trained personnel or support services to ensure FAPE in physical education.  In order to prove a civil rights case, it must be shown that there was an official policy or accepted custom that led to the denial of rights.  <P>
<B><U>Monetary damages under IDEA?</B></U><P>
     <I>W.B. vs Matula</I>, 23 IDELR (3rd U.S. Circuit).  Although no monetary damages have yet been awarded for IDEA violations, a recent ruling by the Third Circuit Court bears watching.  After finding section 504 and IDEA violations, the court found no restriction under IDEA of monetary relief.  The circuit court sent the case back to the district court for a determination of monetary or other damages.  The circuit court suggested that although monetary damages were an option, other types of relief were also available, including "compensatory education beyond a child's age of eligibility, or reimbursement for providing at private expense what should have been offered by the school...."     <BR>

Talking points provide you with basic information that might be helpful to you in raising issues at meetings; with local, state, or federal officials; or with candidates for public office.  <P>
<B>Reauthorization of IDEA</B><P>
&iuml;     The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides protection for children with disabilities, their parents, their schools, and society as a whole  <BR>
&iuml;     IDEA has broad bipartisan support<BR>
&iuml;     Congress was scheduled to reauthorize this bill in the fall of 1995, but has not  <BR>
&iuml;     delays in reauthorization <BR>
     a) give the message that children with disabilities are unimportant to Congress<BR>
     b) disrupt ongoing and emerging state and local efforts<BR>
     c) interfere with school boards' abilities to plan for the upcoming year <BR>
<I>Encourage Congress to get this bill passed!</I><P>
<B>Special Education Personnel Preparation</B><BR>
&iuml;     In 1992-93, states reported a shortage of more than certified 25,000 special education teachers and more than 14,000 related personnel (i.e. physical therapists) <BR>
&iuml;     Every year courts find cases of children being harmed or inadequately served by well-meaning but inadequately trained personnel <BR>
&iuml;     the FY1996 House appropriation bill eliminates all funding for special education personnel training<BR>
<I>Insist on qualified personnel and on state and federal support for training!</I><BR>
   <BR>
<B>Gifted Education</B><BR>
&iuml;     In 1990, 38 states identified more than 2 million gifted and talented students<BR>
&iuml;     In 1995, the total federal support for research and for all the gifted students in the country totaled $4.9 million (less than $2 per gifted student)<BR>
&iuml;     Congress proposes to cut federal support for gifted education and research by about 40%<BR>
<I>These children, by definition, have different educational needs.  Ask what sort of opportunities can be provided with less than $2.</I><BR>

<B><U>Convention in Orlando Swiftly Approaches!</B></U><P>
     It's time for us all to get together again during CEC's Annual Convention -- this time held from April 1-5, 1996 in sunny Florida (and believe me, those of us who have had to endure massive snowstorms this winter are really anxious to get some sun!!!).<P>
<B>Pre-Conference Workshop on IDEA</B> -- One of the events DPP will be involved in during Convention that you might want to attend: We will be holding a 3 _ hour pre-conference workshop on the reauthorization of IDEA during Monday, April 1 from 1:30 to 5:00 p.m.  The Senate is expected to introduce official legislation in February, and we'll be able to go over the proposed changes that will have an impact on the way you educate students with disabilities.  Tell your network not to miss this important event!<P>
<B>What's Happening in Washington</B>? -- As always, DPP will be providing an hour-long update on a variety of legislative and regulatory issues that affect the special education field during the<I> What's Happening in Washington</I>? session.  The session, which will be held on Thursday, April 4 from 2:30 to 3:30 p.m., will be followed by a 1-hour political action session that you and your field can really "sink your teeth into!!"  Entitled <I>Tell Congress What You Think</I>, the session will give you the opportunity to write a postcard(s) to your Congresspersons about one of the issues covered in the <I>What's Happening</I>? session.  DPP staff will provide you with "writing points," addresses, and anything else you and your network will need to let Congress know what you're thinking about issues that are important to you!  Spread the word about these important sessions!!!<P>
<B><U>A Quick Thank You!</B></U><P>
     DPP would like to thank all of you who "rallied your troops" time and again during this most hectic year.  As we mentioned in the last update, you've done a tremendous amount to inform and education Congress on the myriad of issues that CEC is concerned with surrounding the education of students with exceptionalities.  Thank you, too, for providing us with all of the wonderful "success stories" that involve REAL students in REAL schools to share with Congressional members.  It really helps to bring home to Congress that we're talking about actual students, not fictional ones.<P>

<B><U>CEC's New Web Page!</B></U><P>
     Along with the field, CEC is advancing in its technical capabilities too, enabling us to do a better job of keeping you informed!  By April, we expect to have up and running our own web site!!  One of the pages within that site will focus on Public Policy and Legislative/Regulatory issues.  You will be able to access this site through the Internet, and be updated on the issues we in DPP are working on at any hour of the day!!!  Even at 2:00 in the morning, if you're so inclined!!  We hope this will also become an interactive site, with CEC members sharing local-based information with each other; Division CAN Coordinators corresponding with each other; and Federations sharing their concerns and triumphs with each other!  We will give you additional information about how to access this site at the CAN meeting during Convention, as well as in upcoming CAN mailings.
