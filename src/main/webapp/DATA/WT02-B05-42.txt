SUBJECT: FCC MODIFIES CALLER ID POLICY

On Thursday, May 4, 1995, the Federal Communications Commission voted to 
approve national Caller ID rules requiring carriers to provide "a free, 
simple and consistent, per call blocking and unblocking mechanism."  In 
addition, under the new rules carriers are permitted to extend per-line 
blocking options selected by consumers for intrastate calls, to the 
consumers interstate calls.  This action reverses an earlier rule adopted 
in March 1994, that required separate systems for intrastate and interstate 
calls.  The Commissions earlier rules allowed for per-call blocking only.  
The new rules take effect December 1, 1995.

The Center for Democracy and Technology supports the new FCC policy on Caller 
ID.  Caller ID or Automatic Number Identification (ANI) is a device that 
displays to a recipient of a call the telephone number of an incoming call 
while the phone is ringing.  

The introduction of Caller ID technology sparked an emotional and divisive 
debate.  The unlimited use of Caller ID threatened to place the privacy rights 
of the individual in his or her capacity as maker and receiver of telephone 
calls in tension.  Civil liberties organizations were quick to point out that 
technology was available to honor the privacy right of the consumer in their
capacity as both the sender and recipient of phone calls.  Civil liberties 
organizations stated that through blocking users of telephones could be given 
control over information.  For the caller, blocking allows them to choose when 
and to whom to release their phone number.  For the recipient, blocking provides 
receivers with information that an incoming caller does not want their phone 
number revealed.  Additional features can allow recipients of phone calls to 
choose whether or not to refuse all incoming calls that employ blocking, send 
blocked calls to voice mail or answering machine, or exercise their option to 
answer or not answer the unidentified call on a per call basis.  

The latest FCC policy responds to the dual civil liberty concerns of respecting 
and protecting the individual caller's privacy expectations, and respecting the
important privacy interest of the receiver to limit intrusions by unknown, or 
unwanted callers.  

THE NEW FCC POLICY:

1. Where a customer selects per-line blocking for in-state calls the new policy 
   permits that choice to extend to interstate calls as well;

2. Permits customers to prohibit the transmission of Caller ID information - 
   number, name, location - at all times, but on a per-call basis choose to 
   release the information by using the code *82.

3. Binds states without Caller ID and blocking regulations to federal privacy 
   protection models, which require per-calling blocking through the use of 
   code *67.

CDT commends the FCC for issuing a policy that encourages technological 
development that maximizes individual choice and affirms individuals' expectations 
of privacy.
