WORLD WIDE WEB SITE CREATION MADE EASY

ElectriCiti Inc., a San Diego based Internet service provider,
has developed PowerStation, a combination of software and
services that allows individuals and businesses to easily
establish their own presence on the World Wide Web.
Christopher Alan, president of ElectriCiti, emphasized
"Previously, Internet 'home pages' were only available to
those with programming skills. The last technical barrier has
fallen. Those who can use a computer can create their own Web
site using PowerStation's point and click interface and
publish it on the Internet for one full year for just $495."

Alan believes that the company's new PowerStation package
represents a pivotal innovation in the way businesses and
individuals will participate in the growth of the Internet.
"Ben Franklin was fond of saying 'Freedom of the press
belongs to those who own one!"' said Alan. He is convinced
that easy access to the power of publishing on the World Wide
Web means added freedom of expression for individuals and
businesses of all sizes.

The Internet's growth is exploding because people are
realizing that it gives them an opportunity to have a voice on
the new electronic frontier.  College students are putting
their resumes on the Web, businesses are putting product
brochures and catalogs on the Web, community activists are
promoting their activities on the Web. Most other
communication tools such as television, radio, and print media
are very expensive to use. On the World Wide Web you can reach
millions of people, for just a few hundred dollars."

Alan predicts that any organization that currently
distributes information on paper will find the Web a
compelling alternative to the US mail. His chief argument is
one of economics "When you take a look at the cost of
delivering information on paper and compare that to the cost
of delivering information on-line you begin to realize that a
shift in the delivery method is inevitable. The only question
remaining is whether you are going to be on the leading edge
or the trailing edge of the trend."

The PowerStation program allows users to automatically
generate home pages, electronic business cards, resumes,
brochures, portfolio pages and interactive order forms. The
program also includes Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts
which enables users to receive orders from customers or to
program graphic images to act like "point and click" maps.

PowerStation includes five megabytes of Web site space on
ElectriCiti's network of high-speed Sun Sparcstations. The
site can be linked to thousands of other Web sites available
on the global Internet accessible by tens of millions of
Internet users.

ElectriCiti's art director Brad Pennock explains that in
addition to automatically generating the HTML programming
code used to create Web sites, PowerStation guides users
through the process of making their sites more visually
appealing. "The software assists users by providing a palette
of coordinated colors and a large library of professional
quality graphics. A sophisticated interactive multimedia
experience can be created by combining text, full-color
graphics, entry forms, sound and video."

PowerStation was created by an unusual team of software
engineers-most still in high school and college. Senior
software engineer Timothy Kimball is a sixteen year old
student at Gompers High School. Programmer Greg Hamerly worked
full time on the project between graduating from Poway High
School and entering Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. Donna Whitlock
works full time at ElectriCiti as a systems analyst while on a
work practicum from Simon Fraser University in Vancouver.

Christopher Alan, president of ElectriCiti, believes that
high school and college students offer an untapped potential
for developing high-tech progrwns and has given students key
roles since the company's beginning three years ago.
ElectriCiti evolved from a community service organization
comprised of students and programmers who had teamed up to
promote technical literacy among grade school and high school
students.

Alan named his young group of software developers "The
Watchmakers" in honor of a group of students at MIT who helped
build Project Athena, MIT's landmark distributed computing
experiment which established the first campus-wide Internet.
The Watchmakers at ElectriCiti, like their namesakes at MIT,
work as peers, not underlings. The team continues to play an
integral part in developing the company's cutting-edge
technology.

Alan is most proud of the fact that the PowerStation team
achieved the goal he set out for them-to give people the
power to create their own personal or business Web site with
just a few simple clicks of the mouse.

Members of the PowerStation development team are quick to
point out that unlike other Web publishing editors, the
ElectriCiti package gives users the ability to make their Web
sites available on the Internet. Other Internet providers
furnish the space but require users to create pages by writing
HTML code. In contrast, ElectriCiti's new PowerStation
achieves both goals in one easy to use, low priced package.
PowerStation is available for the Microsoft Windows and Apple
Macintosh and Power Macintosh computer platforms.

PowerStation may be previewed on the Internet by accessing
ElectriCiti's Web site at http:Hwww.electriciti.com.

ElectriCiti provides Internet services throughout the United
States. The company's software and service packages are avail-
able directly from ElectriCiti and from computer retail
stores. ElectriCiti maintains offices in San Diego, Orange
County, Los Angeles, and Santa Clara.

Included in this Internet Services Roadmap is a portfolio of
18 types of consulting, security, training and support
services from Digital, whose years of Internet-related
experience and total breadth of global service capabilities
are unmatched by any other single vendor.

These services include systems integration services to help
customers plan business applications and develop or integrate
solutions related to the Internet; network services to assist
customers to establish the network infrastructure required for
Internet access; and outsourcing services for those customers
who do not want to manage Internet-specific servers in-house.

Customers Speak

While Digital customers may be operating at all levels of
involvement on the Internet, they consistently express high
regard in their assessment of Digital's breadth of Internet
service and support capabilities.

"We needed to get our Web product to market very quickly.
Digital was the one-stop shop where we could get Internet
application development, systems integration, outsourcing,
systems management, and top-notch technology. Digital not only
supplied the expertise to do the job, they agreed to manage
all aspects of the Web site's operation." (John Zahner, Vice
President of Business Development, Individual, Inc.,
Burlington, Massachusetts).

"Information is USADATA's primary business. Digital's
technology leadership in utilizing the Internet for
information distribution, combined with their leading edge
Alpha hardware, provided us with the right partner to move our
information business into the 21st century. The knowledge,
experience, and eagerness that Digital engineers brought to
our project confirmed our confidence in their ability to
provide best-in-class Internet solutions." (Rick Murphy,
President, USADATA, Inc. New York, New York).

"Digital's support is very strong, especially in the
networking and workstation areas. They are a major player on
the Internet and a big support of the Internet community"
(Martin Dubetz, Director of Academic Computing and Networking,
Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri).

"I was intrigued with the Internet, but had no idea how to get
my business on-line. So I asked Digital to help me get
started. All of a sudden, I was getting orders from people
around the world, with daily orders from as far away as
Sydney, Australia. Orders can come in at any time of the day
or night, and I don't even have to be on-line." (Jean
Schroeder, Owner, Future Fantasy Bookstore, Palo Alto,
California).

Foremost among the portfolio of Internet services offered by
Digital is its full range of Internet Security & Firewall
Services, followed by its Internet Network Services, Internet
Collaboration Services, Web Server Management, and Web
Information Architecture Service.

All services in Digital's Internet Services Roadmap are
available immediately, and may be ordered singly or in any
combination required. Most are custom priced, several are
fixed price or one-time charges, and they range from one-day
seminars for top management to turnkey management of all
Internet resources. Details are available from any Digital
sales office.

"HTMLSCRIPT" MAKES WEB SERVER
APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT EASIER

(San Diego, CA) Volant Corporation, of San Diego, CA,
has introduced an easy-to-use language for Web Servers called
htmlscript.  Completely browser independent, htmlscript allows
users to develop powerful interactive web pages in a server
safe environment.

Said Joe Austin, CEO Of Volant, "htmlscript solves the
fundamental problem of allowing Web Publishers to produce
sophisticated back-end programs without having to leave the
HTML environment. It's easy to use, powerful, and intuitive.
Site Administrators who have been hesitant to let their users
fully exploit the power of the Web can now let their users
develop applications without compromising system integrity."

The product is installed as a standard CGI application and
provides multiple administrative controls. Users can freely
mix HTML and htmlscript tags in their files. Once executed, it
achieves it's browser independence by operating as a
preprocessor so that it only outputs HTML code. The
htmlscript tags provide the capability to do logic,
calculations, and file input/output operations.

Tom Lettington, COO of ATMNet, a California-based Internet
provider said, "The installation of htmlscript was simple and
we really appreciate its administrative controls and extensive
logging capabilities.  Our users already know HTML, so there
was no training curve either."

Introductory pricing for a 500 user license is $99 and
includes one year of free updates. The software is available
for most UNIX and UNIX workalike systems. Special licensing,
including OEM and site licenses are available. Access to the
reference documentation is available at the
hftp:Hhtmiscript.volant.com/.

A Microsoft Windows NT version of the product is scheduled
for release later this year. The company is also developing a
version of htmlscript that will work with the new Java
software from Sun Microsystems.

Founded in 1992, Volant Corporation is dedicated to providing
services and software technology for the growing Internet
market. The company is privately held and is located at 2629
Ariane Drive, San Diego, CA 92117. For more information, call
619-490-2570.

DERWENT REACTION SERVICE INTRODUCED

Searching Derwent's reaction chemistry online by chemical
structures now possible. Derwent North America introduces its
state-of-the-art chemical reaction database for organic
chemists - the Derwent Reaction Service.  This unique Service
fulfills the information needs of chemists by offering
worldwide chemical reaction information of the highest
quality, in a variety of user-friendly formats.

"The great strength of Derwent's reaction collection is that
it adds only truly novel reactions - about 3,000 reactions
each year out of the millions reported" said Mike Harvey,
Senior Vice President of Intellectual Property for Derwent.
"This means that chemists will now have the ability to search
a comprehensive database and retrieve information on new,
reactions, rather than a series of examples of well-known
reactions" added Harvey.

The Derwent Reaction Service brings together key references
on novel synthetic methods from worldwide scientific and
patent literature. Derwent chemists have compiled this
information using strict selection criteria. This guarantees
that the database contains new reactions, synthetically-useful
modifications of known methods, and details of over 60,000
novel methods from the past twenty years. Each record
features an English-language abstract as well as reactions,
conditions, and structural formulas.

The Derwent Reaction Service is available in-house as a
monthly journal, online, or on CD-ROM. The entire backfile of
reactions found in the DRS is also available on CD-ROM. The
online file - DJSMonline - will be available to all STN users
after its launch at Online Information 1995 in December.

All Derwent Reaction Service products take their name from the
monthly journal (Derwent Journal of Synthetic Methods) and are
an extension and adaptation of Theilheimer's Synthetic
Methods of Organic Chemistry.

Information professionals, research chemists, lecturers and
students can choose the information product, or combination of
products, that meet their specific needs. They may prefer the
journal or CD-ROM for current awareness browsing, the online
database for structure searches, or the backfile CD-ROM for
compact archiving and information browsing.

For more than 40 years Derwent North America, a leading
international scientific and technical provider within Thomson
Business Information, has been providing mission-critical
information to chemists, scientists, companies and research
institutions throughout the world.

For more information, call (800)DERWENT or (800)336-5010.
