<h2>The legal system</h2>
<p>
The Australian legal system is based on the British common law system. 
Legal precedents established by courts under common law are modified 
by statute law made by Commonwealth and State parliaments within their 
respective jurisdictions. In their decision-making, the courts are 
independent of government. Most civil and criminal matters are heard by 
State and Territory courts. The Federal Court rules on matters associated 
with certain Commonwealth legislation, and the High Court of Australia 
hears constitutional matters and acts as the final court of appeal for 
all other courts. Family law and associated disputes are the 
responsibilities of the Commonwealth Government and are settled in private 
by the Family Court of Australia.
<p>
Australia is a signatory to major international treaties and conventions 
and it accepts the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of 
Justice.  The legal profession is based in and regulated by each State 
and Territory. In Victoria, lawyers are either solicitors or barristers. 
Solicitors, who are hired directly by clients, carry out the bulk of 
legal work. If a matter has to go before a court, it will generally be 
argued by a barrister, who must be briefed by a solicitor on behalf of 
the client. Solicitors generally work in partnerships. Some are national 
firms, and the larger firms have international links and provide for the 
international legal requirements of businesses located in the State.
