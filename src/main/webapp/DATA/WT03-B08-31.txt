Carbon Nitride: A
Designer Abrasive

Scientists at the Carnegie Institution (Washington, DC) have used
a combination of state-of-the-art physics, supercomputers, and
insight gained from the study of minerals to predict the first
feasibly synthesizable material that is more incompressible than
diamond. Their calculations show that this material, a cubic form
of carbon nitride, C3N4, should be significantly less compressible
than diamond at room conditions.

Inasmuch as low compressibility is correlated with hardness, it is
highly possible that the new material could be harder than diamond
and therefore of significant technological use as a superabrasive
material and for wear-resistant coatings.

These results, reported in the January 5 issue of Science , rest
upon state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical calculations. The levels
of speed and accuracy now attainable in such calculations enable
investigators to design materials by doing experiments on the
computer instead of in the laboratory. Scientists are thus
beginning to rationally design useful materials in a more efficient
manner than by the traditional "shake-and-bake" methodology of
finding new materials.

The investigators in the new work are David Teter and Russell
Hemley, both serving at Carnegie's Geophysical Lab and Center for
High Pressure Research. Teter and Hemley's work grew from
widespread interest in the possibility of finding new low
compressibility materials. Various forms of carbon nitrides had
been proposed as possible superhard materials potentially exceeding
diamond in hardness. Teter and Hemley identified several favorable
candidate C3N4 prototype forms and calculated their energetics,
structures and physical properties. They determined the cubic-C3N4
form to be the most incompressible.

Their calculations indicate that the cubic- C3N4 material can be
synthesized at pressures and temperatures now attainable in the
laboratory. (The material would be formed at high pressure and
temperature, and then quenched stably to ambient conditions.)
Scientists at the Carnegie institution and elsewhere are already
working to accomplish this, employing insights gained from the
theoretical work now reported. Conceivably, the material can
eventually be synthesized at an industrial scale using technology
similar to that now used to synthesize industrial diamond.

Teter and Hemley write that most experimental studies of carbon
nitrides have been carried out at ambient or low-pressure
conditions; their results indicate the importance of high-pressure
synthesis in the search for new carbon nitrides.

Fibrous Monoliths from
Powder Processing

Advanced Ceramics Research Inc. (851 E. 47th St., Tucson, AZ 85713;
Tel: 520/792-2616, Fax: 520/792 2635, email: acr@rtd.com) claims it
has developed a new generation of advanced composites with high
strength, toughness, and non-brittle fracture characteristics.
Called fibrous monoliths, this processing technology can be applied
to polymers, metals, ceramics, and hybrid composites.  The current
development efforts have mainly concentrated on advanced ceramic
composites, with certain hybrid composites being fabricated to
demonstrate the versatility of the processing technology.

The fibrous monolith concept produces--through ordinary powder
processing--dense fired ceramics with graceful failure
characteristics plus strength and toughness values typically
exhibited for more costly continuous fiber-reinforced ceramic
composites (CFCC's).  These composites have been expected to become
main load-bearing components for many lightweight, high-temperature
structural applications - such as gas turbine engine components.

As of this date, CFCC's have found only limited use although
research and development efforts are continuing. Currently CFCC's
major obstacles are limited formability and product repeatability,
although scientists working on CFCC's are confident that they could
solve these problems. However, the problems they consider difficult
to solve are achieving longer life for the components plus both
high starting material and high fabrication costs.

Advanced Ceramics Research believes fibrous monoliths have
commercial potential in applications now targeted for CFCC's
because of their ease of formability, as-fired damage-tolerant
behavior, and inherent low cost (processed entirely with
conventional powder starting materials).

Fibrous monoliths are multi-phase monolithic ceramics consisting of
a primary phase of high aspect ratio polycrystalline cells
surrounded by outer cell-boundaries of secondary and/or tertiary
phase(s) of different polycrystalline materials.  When engineering
design calls for multiple cell-boundaries, usually, the cell-
boundary adjacent to the cell represents regions of lower shear
strength interdispersed with cell regions of high strength.

The engineered micro architecture of a simple cell/cell-boundary
structure has the appearance, in the as-fired materials, of wood;
hence the apt description of "ceramic wood."  The cell-boundaries
of low shear strength will entrap a propagating crack, thereby
inducing crack deflection during fracture.  This process dissipates
large amounts of energy and leads to non-catastrophic failure
behavior.  It must be mentioned again that there are no dense
ceramic fibers incorporated as starting materials.

The fibrous, polycrystalline, micro architecture of an as-fired
body is an exact replica of the ceramic green body.  This green
body is in-turn formed from ceramic powder-loaded polymer fibers
arranged into a desired micro architectural array (uniaxial,
biaxial, woven fabric, chopped fiber) and then laminated into a
rectangular billet or complex-shape part.

"Green" ceramic fibers are the only building blocks of the fibrous
monolith, for they consist of a core of primary (cell)
polycrystalline powder in a polymer binder, surrounded by shells of
polycrystalline powders in a polymer binder.  Powders must be sized
so that they can be processed in standard thermoplastic extrusion
equipment, and they must be thermodynamically compatible.

Preparation of ceramic green bodies proceeds as follows: co-
extruded single filament is either chopped or cut to desired length
and then laid up into rectangular billets, or woven into 3-D mats.
These pre-shapes are then laminated into rectangular billets--a
typical shape in use for process development.

In another micro architectural configuration, co-extruded multi-
filament rods are cut to desired lengths, aligned inside the die
into either 0 uniaxial or 0-90 biaxial arrays, and then
laminated into rectangular billets.  The billets are then loaded
into a hot-pressing die, binder burned out in a controlled-
atmosphere furnace, and the billet(s) hot-pressed under 25 MPa
uniaxial pressure until ram compaction ceases.

After hot pressing, near full density is achieved and the billet(s)
are machined into various test configurations.  These 0-90
biaxial arrays, in the as-fired condition, have the microscopic
appearance of plywood.  Developmental work is under way to use co-
firing techniques (successfully utilized in the ceramic electronic
industry) to sinter both the cell compositions and the cell-
boundary compositions simultaneously. Limited fibrous monolithic
compositions have been co-fired to acceptable final densities. Co-
firing promises increased final shape complexity employing
sintering techniques versus hot pressing.

Government contracts are driving the development of this fibrous
monolith prototype manufacturing for producing small volumes at low
cost using a wide variety of ceramic compositions in a variety of
applications.  Advanced Ceramics Research, Inc. supplies green
fiber and billets, and can debond, hot press, and sinter a limited
number of shapes.

Ceramic Tapes in
Rapid Prototyping

Researchers at the University of Dayton's rapid prototype
development laboratory (RPDL) is one of the first in the country to
use ceramic tapes in rapid prototyping--an advancement because of
the ceramic's ability to withstand temperatures up to 2,000(C
without falling apart. The project is funded by a 3-year $3.54
million program sponsored by the Advanced Research Projects Agency
(ARPA) and the Office of Naval Research.

"This method looks like it's going to be very successful," said
Richard Chartoff, UDRI senior research engineer and principal
investigator.  "There's no shape distortion or shrinkage of the
part when it's processed, but the main advantage is speed.  The
normal processing of high-temperature ceramics takes weeks."

Using a $200,000 laminated object manufacturing (LOM) machine
developed by Helisys Inc. (Torrance, CA), the researchers are
developing a special fabrication technology.  The LOM system
usually builds layered 3-D objects by stacking and fusing thin
layers of paper that are trimmed to shape by a laser.  Instead of
paper, UDRI has developed ceramic powders held together by a
polymer binder to form "tapes" slightly thicker than a sheet of
paper that are fed into the machine.

In the next stage of the project, researchers will reinforce the
ceramic matrix composites with fibers to increase strength, develop
a laser that is more suited to working with ceramics than paper and
help Helisys develop its next-generation LOM machine.

The research team already has used the technology to build ceramic
electrical components and miniature body armor, among other parts,
but Chartoff is most excited about its potential medical
applications. "There is interest in using this method to make bone
replacement shapes," he said.  "The ceramic forms a shell, which
would eventually be absorbed in the body when replaced by new bone
growth. This is an ideal way to make bone structures--particularly
if we are successful in putting fibers in the ceramic to make it
stronger," Chartoff continued.

Keeping the Troops
Safe in Bosnia

While ceramics are more often thought of as gifts for the holiday
season, ceramic technology and products are playing a vital role in
protecting U.S. peacekeepers in Bosnia.  From lightweight, easily
installed ceramic armor in aircraft and helicopters to protective
shielding used for tanks, personnel carriers and trucks to personal
body armor for troops in the field--the benefits of advanced
ceramics are quite evident in this important mission.

"Advanced ceramics have the double benefit of being harder than the
bullets and shells fired at them while weighing about half as much
as traditional steel armor," explained Robert Skaggs, a senior
materials scientist at Los Alamos National Lab and a member of The
American Ceramic Society (ACerS).

The ceramics advantage already has been demonstrated through a
creative application on numerous aircraft, including the Air
Force's C-141.  Previously unarmored, the C-141s were vulnerable to
small-arms fire from ground snipers.  A new, modular, lightweight
ceramic/metal ("cermet") composite armor was developed that can be
transferred from one aircraft to another, with a total installation
time of about two hours.

"The portability feature ensured that any plane could be armored
quickly and easily without having to armor all of the planes, a
project that would have been far too expensive and required too
much time," said Frank Gac, leader of the Los Alamos National
Laboratory's Ceramic Science and Technology Group and a member of
The American Ceramic Society (ACerS).

This new portable armor was developed by a team of workers from Los
Alamos National Lab, Foster-Miller Co. and Lanxide Armor Products,
Inc., an ACerS corporate member.  The armor consists of several
mats of 4 in. square tiles manufactured by Lanxide from a silicon
carbide/aluminum nitride ceramic composite.  Kevlar, a woven
polymer fabric manufactured by DuPont, is adhered to the back of
the cermet armor.  Foster-Miller then integrates the resulting mats
into a kit that is delivered to the Air Force.  The armor is
attached to the plane's interior using a heavy-duty hook-and-loop
fastening material.

Skaggs explained that the cermet and Kevlar combination acts as a
"catcher's mitt" for bullets fired at the plane.  "When a bullet
hits the cermet tile, the bullet essentially disintegrates, without
damaging the entire tile," Skaggs said.  "The energy from the
bullet is absorbed through the tile while the Kevlar catches the
bullet fragments, preventing injury to the occupants or further
damage to the plane or its cargo."

Ceramic-based armor also is used in Apache, Cobra and Blackhawk
helicopters.  Manufactured by ACerS corporate member Ceradyne Inc.,
(Costa Mesa, CA) and Cercom (Vista, CA), the armor is incorporated
into the seats, floors and wall panels of cockpits to protect the
pilots.

One of the more difficult challenges the peacekeeping force is
expected to encounter is the large number of camouflaged mines
placed throughout the Bosnian countryside by the warring factions
during the last several years of conflict.  Trucks, personnel
carriers and tanks use ceramic armor to provide a previously
unavailable degree of protection and safety.

The LAV-25, for instance, has used modular ceramic armor since the
Gulf War.  Designed to enhance protection against fragments from
152 mm artillery projectiles encountered during the war, the armor
now protects troops from exploding land mines in Bosnia.
Manufactured by Lanxide and by Coors Ceramics Co., a Golden, CO-
based ACerS corporate member, the LAV-25 armor can be applied in
single or multiple layers and can be repaired in as little as 20
minutes from the on-board battle damage repair kit.

Troops in the field also are protected by ceramics.  To increase
their protection from larger rounds, troops slip a ceramic plate
into special pockets in their bullet-proof vests, often made of
Kevlar. Manufactured by Ceradyne, Coors and others, the half-inch
thick ceramic plates protect troops from armor-piercing bullets by
adding about 20 lbs. to the vests' weight.

Laminated Matrix
Adds Toughness

Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology have developed a new
type of material which they believe to be tougher and stronger than
conventional fiber-reinforced composites by applying alternating
thin layers of matrix materials to traditional reinforcement
structures.

These "laminated matrix" composites could replace metals in
aircraft structural components, heat engines, heat exchangers,
particulate filters and other applications requiring high-
temperature, high-strength materials.  By producing composites with
improved properties, the process may allow replacement of costly
reinforcing fibers with less expensive platelets or particles,
driving down the cost of composite materials.

"This idea offers the chance of improving materials properties--
particularly toughness--and lowering costs," said W. Jack Lackey,
a research scientist at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).
"This gives us a wide range of possible new material systems we can
use."

Two conventional techniques exist for making mechanically tough
composites.  The first uses fiber reinforcement within matrix
materials such as ceramics or metals, while the other relies on
building up multiple bonded layers of different materials such as
copper and aluminum.

"We have combined those two approaches," explained Lackey.  "We
make a fibrous preform by stacking up layers of cloth, then
infiltrate a matrix into the preform one layer at a time.  We
infiltrate for a few moments with one material until we get a layer
of it around each fiber, then we infiltrate for a few moments with
another material, then we switch back to the first.  We keep
iterating until we have put down as many as 50 layers."

Sponsored by the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, the
work initially focused on infiltrating a carbon fiber preform with
alternate layers of carbon and silicon carbide matrix.  However,
the new process should also be applicable to silicon carbide or
aluminum oxide fibers, as well as to metallic, polymeric or ceramic
matrix materials.

Lackey notes that the matrix materials--which bind the
reinforcement fibers together and fill in the space between them--
must be carefully chosen to be chemically compatible and closely
matched in their thermal expansion properties.

"We need to consider how these materials will work together," he
said.  "Carbon and silicon carbide are a natural choice.  We knew
those materials were easy to infiltrate into a preform, and we also
knew that they were compatible chemically.  We want to be able to
study what kinds of materials do work well in this type of
composite."

The Georgia Tech research team, which also includes Sundar
Vaidyaraman and Shelli Godfrey, used forced-flow thermal-gradient
chemical vapor infiltration to apply layers ranging in thickness
from 0.02-0.5 microns.  The layers were formed by alternating the
precursor gases flowing into the chemical vapor infiltration
reactor.

Beyond improving the properties of fiber-reinforced composites, the
laminated matrix process could also allow the use of alternate
reinforcing materials that could lower the cost of making
composites.   That could open new applications for composite
materials.

Lackey believes the improved strength and toughness of the
laminated layers may allow the expensive reinforcing fibers--which
cost at least $300/lb.--to be replaced by particles or platelets
costing between $2-$30/lb.  Lackey's team has made composite
samples using silicon carbide grit instead of fibers.

"We have shown that we can make these laminated composites with
inexpensive particulates, replacing a costly reinforcing material
with an inexpensive one," he said.  "But we must demonstrate that
these materials have appropriate properties.  This is highly
speculative, but if it works, there would be a very significant
payoff."

If long-term testing shows that materials made with the laminated
process can provide the necessary properties at a lower cost, that
would allow composites to compete with metals in additional large-
scale applications.  If economically feasible in applications such
as jet engines, for instance, the lighter weight of the laminated
matrix composite components could allow significant performance
improvements in the aircraft using them.

"People are struggling to improve the mechanical properties of
ceramics and ceramic-matrix composites to the point that they can
replace metals," Lackey explained.  "If you can replace metals with
ceramics, you can operate at higher temperatures and get better
efficiency in a heat engine."

In addition to obtaining experimental verification of the new
materials' properties, Lackey must determine the optimal
combination of materials, appropriate thickness of matrix layers
and ideal reinforcing structures.  Finally, the process will have
to be scaled up from laboratory samples to full-sized components.

Georgia Tech has applied for a patent on the process. Georgia
researchers presented their work at the American Ceramic Society's
20th Annual Meeting on Composites and Advanced Materials in Cocoa
Beach, FL, January 7-11, 1996. This effort is sponsored by the Air
Force Office of Scientific Research, Air Force Materiel Command,
USAF, under grant No. F49620-92-J-0148.

Composite Shaped
for Furnaces

A new shaped ceramic composite material produced at 3M (St. Paul,
MN 55144-1000; Tel: 612/733-1110) is intended for use in
applications requiring good heat resistance and mechanical
properties, such as gas fired radiant burner tubes, gas burner
nozzle liners, heat exchangers, thermowells, core busters or flame
dispersers and other gas fired furnace components.  Robert G. Smith
reports that the composite includes ceramic oxide fibers, a coating
of a carbonaceous matrix which includes boron nitride particles,
and a silicon carbide coating.

Radiant burner tubes are used in high temperature, corrosive
environments such as are found in industrial heat treating furnaces
and aluminum melting furnaces.  The three most common types of
commercially available radiant burner tubes are metal alloy, e.g.,
nickel-based superalloy, tubes; ceramic, e.g., silicon carbide,
monolith tubes; and ceramic composite, e.g., ceramic fibers and
ceramic cloth in a ceramic matrix, tubes.  The upper use
temperature of such tubes is typically 900-1260(C.

Although monolithic silicon carbide radiant burner tubes with an
upper use temperature limit of about 1260(C are available, they are
generally brittle and prone to fail.  This is a common problem of
conventional shaped ceramic monoliths.  While it is possible to
select a conventional ceramic composite from which to prepare a
radiant burner tube which meets most of the requirements for use in
high temperature, chemically corrosive environments, it is only
possible by taking great care in the selection of materials and by
making some compromises in properties.

The carbon matrix or coating uses amorphous carbon is amorphous,
and has a thickness of up to one micrometer on an individual fiber.
The 3M product includes 20-50% by weight ceramic oxide fibers, 0.2-
20.0% by weight carbonaceous matrix, 0.2-15.0% by weight boron
nitride, and 50-75% by weight silicon carbide.  U.S. Patent
5,476,684 was assigned for this invention.

Building Insulation
That Takes the Heat

With a goal of becoming the largest "full line" supplier of high-
temperature insulation products, the Carborundum Co. (Fibers Div.,
P.O. Box 808, Niagara Falls, NY 14302; Tel: 716/278-2203, Fax:
716/278-2440) is readying a panel version of its Excelfrax product
line.  Other Excelfrax product forms, including Excelblok rigid-
board insulation, are in the development stage.

The developmental products, as well as the firm's commmercialized
flexible blanket form called the Excelflex Composite Systems, are
based on Excelfrax's core high-temperature insulation material.
This material blends ceramic (alumina and silica) powders and
fibers to produce a microporous structure.  The structure decreases
radiant heat flow, thereby making Excelfrax materials extremely
efficient insulation materials.  The core material can be
manufactured into a variety of product forms, including composite
systems, molded shapes, and rigid boards.

The firm's Excelflex Composite Systems are composed of a high-
temperature (1800(F) core material that has been placed between two
layers of a high-temperature textile.  The standard textile is a
1200(F S-Glass.  However, various high-temperature textiles can be
used in the composite to provide protection from 500(-2,300(F.  The
layers are compressed into a uniform thickness (ranging from 1/8-
inch to 1/2-inch) and density (both standard and lightweight).  The
layers are then quilted into a finished composite.  The Excelflex's
standard configuration is 36" x 36" pads that are lock-stitched
into one-inch squares.

Market manager of Carborundum's Fibers Div., Jim Olchawski (Tel:
716/278-2008, Fax: 716/278-2440), calls Excelflex's extremely good
thermal conductivity its main advantage.  Because of this excellent
thermal performance, Excelflex will provide the maximum amount of
insulation within the smallest amount of weight and space.  Stable
at high temperatures, Excelflex has low thermal diffusivity and
excellent material strength characteristics. Also, Excelflex's
flexibility and ease of fabrication are important considerations
for many applications.

Excelflex provides the best insulation (lowest thermal
conductivity) of all the insulating products currently provided by
Carborundum.  Olchawski recommends it as the material of choice
whenever high-temperature insulating materials are required and
space/weight savings are the primary consideration.  Excelflex
Composite Systems can reduce heat loss and reduce surface
temperatures in a variety of materials, including
aerospace/defense, industrial, and commercial markets.

Aerospace/defense applications for Excelflex include thermal
insulation/fire protection in aircraft engine struts, nacelles,
cowlings, and avionics.  Industrial applications can be found in
nuclear power plants, petrochemical facilities, and other
industrial areas (i.e. incinerators, heat-treatment furnaces,
insulation for kilns and furnaces, and other metal/glass processing
industries).  Commercial applications include commercial ovens,
night storage heaters, and many other appliance applications.

Olchawski explains that Excelfrax is a "natural," the direct result
of two principal factors: The company's technical capabilities,
developed over many years while working with Fiberfrax refractory
ceramic fibers in the same markets and the partnerships created
between the company's full-service applications engineering team
and Carborundum customers in developing critical design solutions
for any application.

Supply Contract
for SiC Whiskers

Hughes Aircraft Co. will demonstrate the advanced process to
produce low cost aluminum metal matrix composites (MMCs) that can
meet the requirements for high-performance military structural
components under a recently awarded $6.2 million U.S. Army
contract.

Of this, ART has been given an award worth $480,000 for further
optimization of a low cost manufacturing process for SiC whiskers
(reinforcements for the metal matrix composites) and for supplying
several hundred kilograms of whiskers to the program.

These selectively reinforced MMCs have potential applications such
as tracked vehicle tread shoes, powertrain parts, like pistons, and
missile structures.  Current technologies to produce MMCs with
lightweight, high-strength properties for these types of components
are very expensive for high volume automotive applications.

The contract, awarded by the U.S. Army Tank Automotive and
Armaments Command (TACOM), is also sponsored by the North American
Technical Industrial Base Organization (NA.HEADLINEBO), which is
composed of U.S. tri-service and Canadian military representation.

Key partners on the Hughes team are the Advanced Materials
Development Center of General Motors' Powertrain Group and Advanced
Refractory Technologies (ART).  GM brings to the program the state-
of-the-art squeeze casting process, created as part of their
development and production of automotive parts.  ART, as part of a
GM-sponsored initiative, has been developing a process for making
the silicon carbide whiskers which are used as the reinforcement
material in this casting process.

3M Cleans Up
Coal Fired Plants

3M has introduced a high performance ceramic composite filter,
which features high temperature capability, resistance to thermal
shock, lightweight and resistance to catastrophic failure.

The Type 203 Ceramic Composite Filter is a rigid, candle-type
filter consisting of Nextel ceramic fibers which reinforce a
silicon carbide matrix.  The ceramic fibers toughen the composite
construction and result in a filter with excellent resistance to
thermal shock and catastrophic failure.  The filter is used to
remove particulate from high temperature gas streams up to 1850F
(1010C).  The collected particulate is removed by reverse pulse
jet cleaning.

The high temperature capability of this filter can eliminate the
need to cool the gas stream prior to filtration, which may increase
process efficiency and eliminate the cost and complexity of gas
dilution, air scrubbers, or heat exchangers.

The light weight (2 lbs.) of this filter reduces the strength
requirements of the tube sheet, and the excellent thermal shock
resistance provides protection during upset conditions. The 3M
Ceramic Composite Filter is designed for advanced coal-fired power
generation systems, such as pressurized fluidized bed  combustion
(PFBC), and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC).

Ceramic, Metal Bond
for Hot Gas Filters

Intumescent materials for joining ceramics to metals at high
temperatures in hot gas filtration systems have been formulated by
scientists at CeraMem Corp. (12 Clematis Ave., Waltham, MA 02154-
7035; Tel: 617/899-0467).  Other potential applications for the
materials include heat exchangers, high temperature vehicle
emission control systems, and heat protection and control systems
for new jet engines.

The cost effective sealing of ceramic components such as
particulate filters to high temperature metal alloys in advanced
coal-based power systems operating at temperatures of up to 1000C
is extremely difficult, reports Robert J. Higgins.  The problem
stems from the large disparity in thermal expansion coefficients of
these two types of materials.

This requirement to seal large gaps between ceramic and metallic
components, coupled with the need to maintain appropriate stress
levels on the ceramic components at all temperatures, places
extreme demands on the properties of the material used to seal the
ceramic-metal gap.  Similar systems operating at lower temperatures
utilize vermiculite-based intumescent mats for this purpose, but
such materials have limited lifetimes when used at temperatures in
excess of 500C and degrade at temperatures above 800C.

CeraMem scientists are investigating the use of multilayer,
biceramic composites that can reversibly expand and contract
between room temperature and 1000C.  These composites will include
various combinations of high temperature oxides fabricated by the
surface modification treatment of thin, tape cast ceramic sheets.

Heat Treatment for
PTCR Barium Titanate

Semiconducting barium titanate (BaTiO3) is of interest for a
variety of applications.  However, it is difficult to manufacture
due to the necessity of preferential distribution of dopants in the
titanate grains, and the sensitivity of the positive temperature
coefficient of resistance (PTCR) performance to the heat treatment
schedule used to sinter the microstructure of these electronic
ceramics.  Prof. Vasantha Amarakoon at Alfred University (New York
State College of Ceramics, Alfred, NY 14802; Tel: 607/871-2497)
reports in the Journal of the American Ceramic Society the effects
of heat treatment on PTCR behavior.

The PTCR behavior occurs as a result of either doping BaTiO3 with
an aliovalent ion or heating in a low oxygen atmosphere which
reduces Ti4+ to Ti3+.  Electronic conduction occurs up to the Curie
temperature (about 120(C) where the resistance increases by several
orders of magnitude.  The necessity of achieving uniform
distribution of liquid phase additives (excess barium, tin) is
dealt with by using a gel-coating process of the grains.  The PTCR
effect is seen to develop when the material is cooled to the
annealing temperature, as the grain boundaries rapidly oxidize when
the liquid phase there solidifies.  Oxygen diffusion continues
during annealing and cooling, which increases the PTCR response.

Optical Waveguides of
Alumina Thin Films

Alumina waveguides formed by reactive rf magnetron sputtering were
studied by researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Hanscom Air Force Base (Lionel O. Bouthillette, Optoelectric
Components Branch, Hanscom AFB, Bedford, MA 01731-2909) as a
candidate material for optical waveguides.  Use of sputtering to
form alumina films enables it to be deposited in the amorphous
state, removing the necessity of achieving a crystallographic match
with the substrate.  The researchers described in the Journal of
the American Ceramic Society amorphous alumina films deposited at
temperatures up to 800(C and varying oxygen flow rates in the
deposition chamber.

The refractive index of the amorphous alumina films averaged 1.65
over a transmission range of 200 nm to 7 microns with reproducible
losses of 1dB/cm at a 632.8 nm wavelength.  A refractive index of
greater than 1.4 is desirable for compatibility with silicon
technology and less than 1.8 for coupling with fibers.  The
chemical inertness, adherence, hardness, and wear resistance, and
mechanical durability of alumina films additionally makes these
materials suitable for waveguide applications.

Actuator Technology
Wins Patent Protection

Research Corp. Technologies (RCT) in Tucson, AZ, has received U.S.
Patent 5,471,721 for a process to transform standard piezoelectric
wafers into unique domed structures that demonstrate an
unprecedented increase in displacement and load capacity over
conventional piezoelectrics.

In 1993, RCT granted an exclusive license to Aura Systems Inc.
(NASDAQ: AURA) in El Segundo, CA to make, use and sell ceramic
actuators using the process. RCT commercialized the technology on
behalf of Clemson University and the inventor, Dr. Gene Haertling.

Dr. Haertling's RAINBOW (reduced and internally biased oxide
wafers) support moderate loads while achieving large displacements
with modest applied voltages.  RAINBOWs are rugged, reliable, cost-
effective, and easy to make and use.

Structurally similar to standard piezoelectric unimorphs, the
unique structures can support over 100 psi or displacements of 50
mils, depending on load, size and composition.  Moreover, this
performance can be augmented by stacking multiple RAINBOWs.

RAINBOWs have a broad range of potential applications including
speakers, microphones, pumps, actuators, sensors, relays, switches,
transducers, hydrophones, vibrators, accelerometers, positioners,
and pyroelectric detectors.  Aura Ceramics, Inc., a subsidiary of
Aura Systems, supplies component RAINBOWs to OEMs.

"RAINBOWs offer more than an order of magnitude increase in
displacement over existing piezo approaches," said Jim Sloane,
president of Aura Ceramics.  "It's an enabling technology that will
open up numerous applications to the simplifying solutions of
active ceramics."

State/Country: Japan

A novel crystallizable glass composition for producing a novel low
temperature co-fired glass-ceramic substrate having patterns of a
low electrical-resistance conductor such as Ag, Ag-Pd, Au, and/or
Cu is obtained. Being subjected to a firing process, the novel
crystallizable glass can precipitate mullite as main crystalline
phase, and at least one subordinate crystalline phase among
forsterite, spinel, sapphirine, and similar crystalline phases. And
also, the novel crystallizable glass powder composition with an
inorganic filler as external additive having a minimum of 1.4 m2/g.
of mean specific surface area can precipitate both mullite phase
and cordierite phase. The mixing weight ratio of the filler to the
crystallizable glass powder is from 0.1/99.9 to 20/80. The
crystallizable glass composition comprises following oxide
components expressed in terms of percent by weight on the oxide
basis; 45-58% of Al2O3, 20-35% of SiO2, 5-15% of B2O3, 5-20% of
MgO, and 0-4% of alkali metal oxide. The substrates produced from
the above compositions have high flexural strength, low dielectric
constant, low loss factor, and controllable thermal expansion
coefficient of ranging from approximately 30 to 70X10-7/C. As for
the substrate containing both mullite phase and cordierite phase,
as the substrate has a low thermal expansion coefficient, it can be
combined with AlN to produce a composite structure package.

HTS Filters for
Cellular Market

Illinois Superconductor Corp. (ISC, Mt. Prospect, IL) has been
installing and testing receivers that will substantially reduce
dropped calls and annoying static common in car phones.  The high-
temperature superconducting (HTS) filters, to be used in cellular
base stations, are designed to operate in the 825-850 MHz frequency
range.

The work has been partially supported by a 3-year, $3.5 million
project funded by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology's Advanced Technology Program.  Other partners in the
project include AT&T Bell Labs and Northwestern University.

To make these filters, ISC is using HTS thick-film material
developed by a team, now at the University of Birmingham
(Birmingham, England), that was funded in part by Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization (BMDO).  While the radio frequency (RF)
properties of HTS thick-film materials are not as good as competing
HTS thin films, they are much easier to make.  For example, thick
films can coat 3-D objects (thin films cannot), enabling the
fabrication of RF components designed to maximize performance.  In
addition, thick-film materials can be sprayed, dip-coated, or
brushed onto desired substrates. In contrast, thin films must be
made in clean-room facilities using a sophisticated laser process.

Hg-Based Materials
Challenge Researchers

A paper presented by Paul Chu, et al., (The Texas Center for
Superconductivity and Dept. of Physics, University of Houston,
Houston, TX 77204; Tel: 713/743-8212) at the fall meeting of the
Materials Research Society focused on research underway on mercury-
based high-temperature superconductors, the homologue series,
HgBa2Can-1CunO2n+2+d [Hg-12(n-1)n or HBCCO] with n = 1, 2, ...7.

They were first found by a Swiss team in Zurich to be
superconducting at temperatures up to 134 K.  Later, the Houston
group raised the superconducting temperatures of these compounds to
a record-high temperature of 164 K by squeezing the sample, making
it possible for the first time to achieve the superconducting state
by using household air-conditioning technology.

These materials exhibit an impressive current carrying capacity of
up to one million amperes per square centimeter at 100 K, observed
by the IBM group at Yorktown Heights after making the compound into
the thin film form.  The figures translate to a theoretical limit
of about 10 million amperes per square centimeter at the liquid
nitrogen temperature of 77 K.

Chu said that because of the simple and yet subtle crystal
structure of the compounds, specifically the linear Hg-O
coordination that allows a large cation-doping range, scientists
are given the opportunity to peer into the effects of atomic
arrangement and doping on the occurrence of superconductivity at
high temperatures.

Some of the experimental results on these compounds have
demonstrated the limits of and the modifications needed in some of
the prevailing models of high-temperature superconductivity.  A
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) was made from
this compound and operated at the unprecedentedly high temperature
of 114K by the IBM group.

However, he added that the mercury-based compounds are rather
unstable.  Usually, they are not easy to make in pure form, and
they decompose easily at the high temperatures required to shape
them into practical forms, such as wires for power transmission and
generators.   This is to say that Hg is lost at temperatures above
350(C.

Recently, progress has been made in this respect.  By doping the
compounds, the synthesis of the materials has been simplified and
the materials so prepared become more stable.  Preliminary success
has been achieved in wire-making.  Small single crystals of the
compounds have been obtained with high enough quality for
scientific study.  However, more material improvements are needed
before these new compounds can become a material of practice.  Dr.
Chu was not available to elaborate on these topics at press time.

Current Limiter
Prototype Tested

American Superconductor Corp. has successfully demonstrated a 2.4
kV high temperature superconducting (HTS) current limiter prototype
in partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT), Southern
California Edison (SCE) and Los Alamos National Lab (LANL).  The
project was funded by the Dept. of Energy, under their
Superconductivity Partnership Initiative program.  The
demonstration took place at SCE's Center Substation in Downey, CA.

The current limiter incorporates the world's largest HTS coil,
which was manufactured and delivered earlier this year by American
Superconductor.  Current limiters are devices that instantaneously
limit the flow of electrical current, and mitigate the effects of
short circuits, lightning or power fluctuations.  The devices
essentially act as giant surge protectors, which protects expensive
utility transmission and distribution equipment.  American
Superconductor expects to commercialize HTS current limiters in the
1998-1999 time frame.

"This demonstration is significant in that it shows that HTS wire
and coil technology is advancing rapidly to meet the needs of the
electric power industry," said Dr. Dean Peterson, Center Leader of
the Superconductivity Technology Center at Los Alamos National
Laboratory.  He added, "Development of high performance, low cost
current limiters will yield improved reliability, efficiency and
cost improvements for the electric utility industry.

Greg Yurek, president and CEO of American Superconductor,
commented:  "The successful demonstration of the prototype
utilizing our leading edge HTS coil represents another significant
technical milestone for American Superconductor and validates our
expected time line for commercialization of this product line.  Our
commercialization efforts in the area of current limiters will
continue with a number of global partners to meet the existing and
growing demand for HTS devices that overcome the limitations of
conventional copper-based technology."

Model for Complex
Vortex Behavior

One of the main obstacles in the development of practical high-Tc
superconducting materials is the dissipation caused by the motion
of vortices.  By using the speed and memory of parallel computers,
researchers at Argonne National Lab have numerically simulated,
using extremely fine temporal and spatial resolution, a model for
complex vortex behavior.

Resulting numerical simulations or vortex dynamics in a
superconducting sample show that, in the presence of a strong
magnetic field, the vortex lattice maintains a superstructure where
regions of varying vortex density are separated by stationary fault
lines.  Furthermore, the vortex lattice may have misoriented grains
that gradually "heal" when subjected to a weak current.  The
researchers also find that the orientation of the vortex lattice
depends on the strength of the transport current.

Argonne welcomes collaborations with industry to explore ways in
which computational models can be used for predicting the
performance characteristics of HTS superconducting wires and tapes.

chemical phenomena in sol-gel thin-film deposition by dip-coating
and used these phenomena to control such film properties as
refractive index, volume fraction porosity, and pore size.

Eleven researchers at Ames Lab won the Outstanding Scientific
Accomplishment Award for "Investigation of Single-Crystal RNi2B2C
Magnetic superconductors," The team has been investigating the
electronic and magnetic properties of the superconductors. The
experiments have revealed phenomena associated with the
simultaneous interplay of strong electron-photon interactions and
magnetic couplings.

A Pacific National Lab team with eight researchers won the Award
for Signification Implication for DOE-Related Technologies on
"Aqueous Deposition of Ceramics on Plastics and Complex Shapes."
The team developed a methodology to deposit ceramic films from
supersaturated aqueous solutions onto a wide range of substrate
materials. The technique provides conformal coatings on complex
shapes and can be used to deposit patterned coatings.

Brake Production
Facility Starts Up

Lanxide Corp., Nihon Cement Co., Ltd., Kanematsu Corp. and Lanxide
K.K. have announced the commissioning of a new automotive
manufacturing line for production of ceramic-reinforced aluminum
brake rotors and drums.  The new production line, located at
Lanxide Corp.'s facilities in Newark, DE, is a result of a
cooperative development program among the four companies.

The manufacturing line will be used to produce newly introduced
lightweight ceramic-reinforced aluminum brake rotors and brake
drums for the automotive industry.  The new rotors and drums are
less than half the weight of their traditional cast iron
counterparts, and respond to the widespread industry need for
weight reduction to meet ever tightening government emissions and
fuel economy standards. Initial capacity of the production line
will be approximately 15,000 rotors and drums per year, expected to
increase to 60,000 units per year within a year.

The world's first production automobile to utilize LANXIDE ceramic-
reinforced aluminum brake rotors, the new Lotus Elise sports car,
was introduced at the Frankfurt Auto Show last year. The Elise uses
four silicon carbide ceramic-reinforced aluminum brake rotors
manufactured by Waupaca Foundry, Inc., under license from Lanxide
Corp.

According to Marc S. Newkirk, president and CEO of Lanxide Corp.,

Tensile Properties
of CMCs Tested

A joint Korean and Japanese research effort studied the tensile
properties of ceramic matrix composites. Researchers Dong-Woo Shin
and Keun Ho Auh (Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea) and Hidehiko
Tanaka (National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials,
Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan) characterized the mechanical
properties of various 2D ceramic matrix fiber composites by tension
testing, using the gripping and alignment techniques. The woven
fabric composites used for the test had the basic combinations of
Al2O3, fabric/Al2O3, SiC fabric/SiC, and SiC monofilament uniweave
fabric/SiC.

Tension testing was performed with strain gauge and acoustic
emission instrumentation to identify the first matrix-cracking
stress and assure a valid alignment. The peak tensile stresses of
these laminate composites were about one-third of the flexural
strengths. The SiC monofilament uniweave fabric (14 vol%)/SiC
composites showed a relatively high peak stress of 370 MPa in
tension testing.

The full paper is available in the Journal of the American Ceramic
Society [78 (11), 1995].

Behavior of SiC
Fibers in a Matrix

This work was done by Hyunho Shin at School of Materials Science
and Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA
30332. The full paper is published in the Journal of American
Ceramic Society [78 (11), 1995].

A Nicalon SiC fiber-reinforced Si-Al-Ca-O-N composite was
fabricated by a slurry infiltration process followed by hot
pressing at 1600C.  A carbon-rich interfacial layer (~100 nm) as
well as a crystalline silicon-rich layer (~15 nm) were observed
between the fiber and matrix. Based on this interfacial
phenomenology, the following behavior of SiC fibers in the matrix
was proposed:  fine SiC grains (diameter of ~1.7 nm in as-received
fibers) decomposed at fiber surfaces (SiC  C + Si), followed by
silicon migration into the glassy phase of the matrix.  The glassy
phase was interpreted to play a key role as a silicon consumer in
fostering the formation of the carbon-rich layer.  The presence of
silicon implied that the oxygen activity in the matrix was low
enough to avoid SiC oxidation.
