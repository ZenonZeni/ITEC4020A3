<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>MAINSTREAM PHYSICIANS WAIT FOR BODY OF EVIDENCE</CENTER></H2><p>

Mainstream medicine can no longer deny the positive health benefits of fiber
and antioxidant supplements. Perhaps to save face after long years of denial,
the following statement appeared in the July 21, 1994, issue of <I>New England
Journal of Medicine</I>.

<P>"Those who consume high-fiber diets or take antioxidant supplements may be
healthier than those who do not, for reasons that have nothing to do with the
diet or the supplements. We may not even know about other [influencing] factors.
Chance cannot be ruled out even when it is highly unlikely. No matter how
important the conclusions, they should usually be considered tentative until a
body of evidence accumulates pointing in the same direction." 

<P>While the
mainstream physician waits for the "body of evidence" to accumulate, alternative
practitioners have that evidence in place and use it to help their patients get
well. From Dr. Serafina Corsello on the east coast (Ne<P>In fact, double-blind, controlled studies permeate the very journal in which the
above statement has been published.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Hip fracture incidence increases over the long term with 
     the use of a drug</CENTER></H3>

It's not easy to be a good researcher, mainly because many studies are
flawed. One example involves a drug prescribed for women who have (or are at
risk for) osteoporosis. Research has shown that this drug does inhibit bone
resorption, and that's good-bone density will be preserved. But, although there
is a very modest increase in bone mass after two years of treatment, hip
fracture incidence increases in the third or fourth year with the use of this
drug. The drug has other side effects, too. Among them: it contributes to the
incidence of microfractures because of the decreased bone turnover. The drug
is also very costly. 

<P>A new study appeared in the medical journals confirming
this drug's ability to retard bone loss. But the study was terminated after two
years! If it had been continued for a longer period of time, surely the results
would have matched those of research that had been done previously, showing
that, in the long term, there was more risk than benefit. Physicians reading
this article would have no way of knowing that the results would have been
different had the study been continued.

<P>The drug in question is etidronate, and
we bring this to your attention because it is a widely prescribed medication.
There are far better ways to preserve bone integrity.
