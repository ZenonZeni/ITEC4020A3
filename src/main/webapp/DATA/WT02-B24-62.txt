<h2>Obligations of States and School Districts to Students with Disabilities and 
Their Parents in Interstate Transfer Situations</h2>

<p>Margaret Carr<br> 
Advocacy Committee 

<p>Thomas Hehir, Director, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP),
December 6, 1995, in response to a number of requests for clarification,
addressed the responsibilities of states and school districts to students
with learning disabilities when they transfer from one state to another.
Under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) a
school district must make available a free appropriate public education (FAPE) 
to all resident children with specified disabilities in the mandated
age-ranges and must ensure both the children and their parents have the
rights and protections guaranteed by Part B of IDEA (20 USC  §1412(2)
(5). FAPE comprises an appropriate education program designed for each
individual student according to both Part B and education standards of
the state of residence. Each state, under 34 CFR  §300.600, must supervise 
and ensure programs in the state providing education services to students
with disabilities meet both federal and state standards.

<p>When a student moves from one state to another, the receiving school
district must first determine whether it will adopt the student's most
recent evaluation and individual education plan (IEP). Since the
evaluation and IEP from the sending state were based partially on the
education standards and eligibility criteria of the sending state, the 
student's evaluation and IEP may not be consistent with the education
standards of the receiving state. If the receiving district determines
that the previous evaluation complies with both state law and Part B of
IDEA, it may adopt the evaluation and provide parental notice in
accordance with 34 CFR  §300.504(a).

<p>The receiving district must also examine the student's IEP to
determine compliance with state law and Part B of IDEA. If the receiving
district determines that the IEP is appropriate and can be implemented,
no IEP meeting need be held if the parent is satisfied with the current
IEP (Appendix C to 34 CFR Part 300 (question 6)). If, however, either 
the parent of school district is dissatisfied with the existing IEP, and
IEP meeting must be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days after
the receiving school districts accepts the eligibility determination and
evaluation of the previous school district.

<p>If the receiving school district does not accept the previous
evaluation, the district must evaluate the student without <i>due
delay</i> and provide proper parental notice under 34 CFR §300.128,
§300.220 and §300.504(a). The new evaluation must be treated as a
preplacement evaluation under 34 CFR §300.531. The receiving district
must obtain parental consent (34 CFR §300.504(b)(1)(i)). Special
education services may be provided to the student during the evaluation
process if parents and the district can agree on an interim IEP. If there
is disagreement, however, the student will be placed in regular 
education. Once the receiving district completes its assessment, an IEP
meeting must be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the
date of eligibility determination (34 CFR §300.343(c)). At the meeting an
appropriate IEP should be developed and adopted to address the unique
education needs of the student.

<p>If the parents disagree with the new evaluation or proposed IEP, they
may initiate an impartial due process hearing under 34 CFR §300.506.
Pending the hearing the student may be placed in the program proposed by
the receiving district, with the parents' consent, or in another
placement on with both the parents and district agree. If agreement on an  
interim placement is not reached, the receiving district is not required
to implement the interim IEP or to approximate services provided under
the previous IEP. In such a situation the receiving district will place
the student in the regular education program in accordance with 34 CFR
§300.513(b).
