<H2>Sustainable Energy Strategy: Clean and Secure Energy for a Competitive Economy</H2>
<HR><P>
Energy is a primary mover of industrial economies, high living standards, environmental challenges, and geopolitical struggles. While clearly important in crisis situations, energy policy remains a national priority even when no immediate crisis focuses national attention. <BR>

<P>

As the Nation looks toward the 21st century, a new era is taking shape an era in which dynamic energy markets and advanced energy technologies have the potential to alleviate many of the economic, environmental, and national security concerns that have driven energy issues over the past decades. We are unlikely to realize the full potential of this new era, however, without a national energy policy that continually guides our markets and technologies toward the goals of affordable, clean, reliable, and secure energy. National policy that maximizes energy productivity, prevents pollution, and helps shield our Nation from global energy risks can improve our standard of living today and enhance our quality of life tomorrow.<BR>

<P>

This document presents  the Clinton Administration's national energy policy. The policy is built upon the bipartisan consensus that has emerged in the U.S. Congress, most recently embodied in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The policy is implemented by the Department of Energy and other Federal agencies, and it actively engages State and local government and the private sector, where much of the dynamism of our society resides.<BR>

<P>

In the United States, the private sector determines most features of energy production and use.  This is appropriate, given the poor record of direct government intervention to set prices or to allocate resources in energy markets. The Administration's energy policy emphasizes and reinforces the dominant role of the private sector and supports expanding the role of markets in several key areas.  However, there remains an important role for the Government in preventing abuse of the environment, providing some national insurance against import disruption, and conducting research and development efforts in partnership with the private sector.<BR>

<P>

The Administration pursues a rational and focused energy policy informed by past experiences both positive and negative.  By prioritizing Federal support, we bolster research and development into new energy technologies that have the potential to transform our economy and restore the environment, while cutting back funding for mature technologies and collaborating with industry to avoid "picking winners." We support privatization and extending competition in energy markets where government no longer needs to play a prominent role, but we stand behind our energy producers and technology vendors as they meet fierce competition abroad.  We are reinventing Federal environmental regulation but are firmly opposing efforts to roll back a generation of progress on protecting the environment. The Administration's energy policy reflects a common sense approach that helps both energy consumers and producers, gives a high return to the taxpayer, respects our environment, and looks toward the future.<BR>

<P>

In developing its energy policy, the Administration conducted numerous public meetings across the country to listen to the concerns and ideas of individuals and organizations most involved with energy issues, as well as citizens concerned about the energy future. A separate volume summarizes public input.<BR>

<P>

In addition to public meetings, the Departments of Energy, Commerce, State, and Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency have actively participated in the deliberations of the President's Council on Sustainable Development. This advisory body consists of Cabinet officials, business leaders, and the heads of environmental, labor, and community groups. Although the Council will submit final recommendations to the President later this year, the Administration's energy policy reflects much of the Council's efforts over the past 2 years.<BR>

<P>

The Clinton Administration's energy policy responds to the concerns of today and the challenges of tomorrow. It recognizes the interrelationship between energy, the economy, and the environment and the importance of the international marketplace to our economic future. The Administration will continue to work with Congress and the people to attain our economic, environmental, and national security goals.<BR>
