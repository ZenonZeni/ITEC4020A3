<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Oceanography Day 1997</H2>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>The University of Texas Marine Science Institute plans to host another
Oceanography Day, April 26, 1997. Our goal is to bring this exciting educational
program to an even greater number of Boy Scouts than attended the most
recent Oceanography Day in 1994, when 350 Scouts and 150 adult leaders
participated. These Scouters were from 100 different Scout troops in 50
different towns and cities. Oceanography Day includes a full day of activities
at the Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas. Scouts take a trip aboard
a Research Vessel, either the R/V LONGHORN or the R/V KATY, make a plankton
net, participate in a laboratory plankton identification session, and attend
presentations on exciting current research programs. Before coming to Oceanography
Day Scouts pass the first six requirements of the Oceanography Merit Badge.
During Oceanography Day the 7th (project) requirement is passed. After
Oceanography Day the final requirement (500 word report) is completed and
mailed to the Oceanography Day Chairman, who is also the Oceanography Merit
Badge Counselor. Scouts receive their approved blue cards in the mail and
their merit badge through their own troop. </P>

<P><B>Ron Benner</B> <BR>
-Dr. Benner's research is in the area of microbial ecology. When he is
not in his laboratory at the Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas,

up the Amazon River in South America. </P>

<P><B>Paul Montagna</B> <BR>
-Dr. Montagna is a benthic ecologist. Dr. Montagna will be showing Scouts
some of the common forms of marine invertebrates found in the South Texas

<P><B>Ken Dunton</B> <BR>
-Dr. Dunton and his students study Texas seagrasses as well as do research
on the Antarctic Peninsula (64&oslash; south latitude) and the High Arctic
(75&oslash; north latitude) where they study the adaptations made by polar
seaweeds to low temperatures and light and the thinning ozone layer. Dr.
Dunton will show Scouts how his team collects these measurements by diving
under the ice in both the Arctic and Antarctic. </P>

<P><B>Dean Stockwell</B> <BR>
-To reach his local study sites in the Nueces Basin, Dr. Stockwell operates
fast shallow draft jet-drive boats and ATV's and to reach his other study
sites under the Arctic Ice near the North Pole he travels aboard the U.S.
Navy's Nuclear Powered Submarine, the USS CAVALLA. </P>

<P><B>Ellery Ingall</B> <BR>
-Dr. Ingall is a marine chemist who studies the cycling of nutrients required
by all living things in the ocean. Recent work has taken him to the Gulf
of Mexico on the R/V LONGHORN and to the bottom of the ocean off Peru in
the Johnson Sea-Link Submersible. </P>

<P><B>Peter Thomas</B> <BR>
