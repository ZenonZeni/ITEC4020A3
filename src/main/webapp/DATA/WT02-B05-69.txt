<h2>Celebrating the Formation of CDT</h2>
<p>
The Center for Democracy and Technology was born over hot soup and dumplings at <b>Eat First</b>, a hole-in-the-wall chinese resturant in DC's Chinatown. When it came time to have a party to celebrate the formation of the organization, we couldn't think of a better place. So on April 26, 1995 CDT invited Senator Leahy, Congressman Don Edwards, and 100 of our closest friends and colleagues to eat, drink, and enjoy the place where we were born.
