<p align="center"><b>Medical Marijuana Initiative Heads For
California Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 23, 1996, Santa Monica, CA:</b>&nbsp;
Proponents of a state-wide initiative to legalize marijuana for
medical use report that they have collected over 750,000
signatures, well over the number necessary to place it on the
November 1996 California ballot. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Supporters were elated by the success of the signature-gathering
drive and noted that a last week blitz of over 140,000 signatures
virtually guaranteed that Californians will have an opportunity
to vote on the issue this year.&nbsp; A final validation of the
estimated 750,000 signatures is expected in five to eight
weeks.&nbsp; The number of signatures required to qualify the
initiative for the 1996 ballot is 433,269. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">California's medical marijuana initiative came about in response
to Governor Pete Wilson's decision to veto legislation passed by
the California Legislature in 1995 that would have allowed for
the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for those diagnosed
by a physician to be suffering from the diseases of AIDS, cancer,
glaucoma, and multiple sclerosis.&nbsp; The 1996 initiative maintains
that any patient who possesses a valid doctor's recommendation
should be allowed to use marijuana as a therapeutic agent without
fear or risk of prosecution.&nbsp; If the initiative is passed by
California voters this fall, the measure will become law
immediately and cannot be vetoed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The issue here is simple; sick people should not be
arrested for using medicine that their physicians recommend to
them,&quot; said California NORML coordinator Dale Gieringer. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information, please contact either Dale Gieringer of
California NORML @ (415) 563-5858 or Dennis Peron of Californians

<p align="center"><b>Vermont Senate Approves Hemp Legislation: <br>
However, State Still A Long Ways Away From Cultivation</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 18, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp; An
amended version of legislation that had been previously approved
by the House to permit the development of a domestic hemp
industry in Vermont was passed by the Senate by a 15-10
vote.&nbsp; The amended measure reportedly &quot;narrows the
focus&quot; of the bill (H.783) and now must be re-approved by
the Rouse before being sent to the governor.&nbsp; Because the
measure failed to receive two-thirds majority support in the
Senate, it is expected be vetoed by Gov. Howard Dean who remains
opposed to any efforts to legalize industrial hemp.&nbsp;
&quot;It is a terrible message to send to children,&quot; wrote
Dean in an April 8 letter to hemp-activist, Colorado Sen. Lloyd
Casey (D- Northglenn). <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney), a chief proponent of the
legislation, told <b>NORML</b> that the House is going to take
its time and &quot;let things develop&quot; before rushing to
approve the amended legislation.&nbsp; Maslack stated that House
backers are considering several options at this time, including
trying to override Dean's expected veto of the bill and/or
tacking the controversial legislation onto an economic
development bill considered sacred to the governor.&nbsp;
&quot;It's not over 'til it's over,&quot; Maslack told the <i>Associated
Press</i>. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Kathleen Keenan, chairwoman of the House Commerce Committee, told
the AP that she sees hemp as an &quot;economic development
issue,&quot; but noted that &quot;it has enough merit to stand
alone.&quot;&nbsp; Keenan further added that she was uncertain
how committed Dean was to the economic development bill and
cautioned that he may, in fact, veto it with the hemp provision
included. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Keenan's warning has little affect on the bill's proponents,
however, who consider the latest round of political one-upmanship
a &quot;positive&quot; note.&nbsp; The approval from the Senate
was &quot;one more step in the process,&quot; said Maslack.&nbsp;
&quot;[It's] not the first step [and it's certainly] not the last
step,&quot; but it's definitely a step in the right direction. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><i>For more information on the latest status of the Vermont hemp
bill, please contact the House Clerk's Office @ (802)

<p align="center"><b>$250 Million Appropriation Request From New
Drug Czar<br>
Stresses Source Reduction, Interdiction</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 1996, Washington, DC:</b>&nbsp; New
White House Drug Czar, General Barry McCaffrey, has submitted a
request to Congress for an additional $250 million to combat
drugs.&nbsp; Not surprisingly, the majority of the requested
funding ($202 million) is to be used to beef up the
administration's source-reduction and domestic interdiction
programs.&nbsp; For example, the proposal's largest financial allotment,
$98 million, is requested to upgrade surveillance aircrafts to
patrol known drug source countries such as Columbia and
Peru.&nbsp; In addition, $27 million is to be spent on domestic enforcement,
including marijuana eradication, and $13 million is allotted to
the DEA for &quot;classified programs.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Cincinnati Buyers Club Founder To Face
Felony Drug Charges</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 19, 1996, Covington, KY:</b>&nbsp;
Richard Evans, founder of the Greater Cincinnati Buyers Club --
one of an estimated 30 underground clubs located across the
country that supply marijuana as a therapeutic agent to seriously
ill patients who possess a physician's recommendation -- has been
charged with three felony counts of trafficking marijuana within
1,000 yards of a school in connection with a February raid by law
enforcement officers on the club's headquarters.&nbsp; Evans' home,
which is located in close proximity of a school, served as the
headquarters for the Cincinnati club.&nbsp; Evans informed <b>NORML</b>
last February that he had two marijuana seedlings growing at the time
of the bust. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Evans was subpoenaed to testify before the Kenton County Grand
Jury on April 19 and questioned about his involvement in the
buyer's club.&nbsp; Evan's plead the Fifth Amendment and was later
taken to Kenton County Jail.&nbsp; He was released on $5,000 bond
and will be arraigned on Monday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am sick of living in a country where I can't be
free,&quot; Evans adamantly summarized at a press conference
following the raid last February. &quot;Give me liberty or give
me death.&nbsp; We are going to have a cannabis buyer's
club.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Woody Harrelson Withholds Taxes To Protest
Industrial Hemp Prohibition</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>April 17, 1996, Denver, CO:</b>&nbsp; Appalled
at the recent defeat of a bill that would have allowed Colorado
to become the first state to legally grow industrial hemp since
World War II, Hollywood actor and hemp activist Woody Harrelson
has withheld $10,000 of his taxes to protest the government. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I know I'm only a pampered actor with no room to complain,
... but the fact is I care,&quot; Harrelson wrote in a two page
proclamation.&nbsp; Previously Harrelson, who has commercial
interests in a hemp clothing company, had pledged his support for
the Colorado hemp bill by affirming that he &quot;will personally
guarantee that all hemp produced in Colorado will be purchased at
fair market prices.&quot;&nbsp; The legislation was recently
killed by the House Agriculture Committee by a 8-5 vote. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to a story that ran in <em>USA Today</em>, Harrelson
said that he's been quietly fighting on behalf of industrial hemp
and other environmental causes for years.&nbsp; He even slipped
president Clinton a letter regarding hemp cultivation while they
both attended actor Ted Danson's wedding, the feature noted. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In response to Harrelson's action and to commemorate his efforts
on behalf of the Colorado Hemp Production Act of 1996, the
Colorado Hemp Initiative Project (CO-HIP) has declared July 23 to
be Woody Harrelson Appreciation Day.&nbsp; &quot;Mr. Harrelson
has shown great courage and integrity in speaking out in the name
of the [environment,] said CO-HIP's Laura Kriho.&nbsp; &quot;As a
well known and talented actor, his fame has brought media
attention to issues like the salvage logging rider and the
industrial hemp movement.&nbsp; We hope he continues to be a
vocal supporter.&quot; <br>
