</center>

<p>The U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy 
(EE) is the federal government's principal agency for assisting in the research, 
development, and commercialization of energy efficiency and renewable energy 
technologies.

<p>Some of the EE programs delivered in partnership with state governments include:

<p><strong>State Energy Program (SEP)</strong>
<br>The SEP is the result of a merger of State Energy Conservation Program (SECP) and 
Institutional Conservation Program (ICP) activities.  The SEP provides grants and 
technical assistance to states and U.S. territories to develop and implement state energy 
plans.  SEP has flexibility comparable to a block grant program, allowing states to tailor 
activities to their needs.  Each dollar provided by the federal government catalyzes an 
average of $19 in additional state and private spending.  SEP is funded at $25.9 million 
in FY 96, which is 50 percent of the funding level from FY 95.  In addition to this 
funding, $11 million were provided to states for individual energy projects they 
identified in FY 95.  SEP provides cost-shared grants to states to conduct energy analyses 
and energy capital improvements in schools and hospitals.  The traditional program 
requires a 50/50 match of state and federal money.

<p><strong>Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)</strong>
<br>WAP is a formula grant program that disburses over $200 million annually to retrofit 
more than 100,000 homes of low-income citizens, particularly the elderly, those with 
disabilities and families with children.

<p><strong>Sustainable Technology Energy Partnership Program (STEP):
Accelerating the Commercialization of New Technologies</strong>
<br>This pilot program is designed to open the national laboratories to small- and 
medium-sized businesses.  State Energy Offices (SEOs) act as agents for private sector 
companies in the state, helping the companies define research project concepts and 
submitting them to DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for funding 
consideration.  EE expects to award about $9 million, funding up to half the cost of 
research projects selected, with businesses and the states providing the remainder.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ott.doe.gov/program/otu/epact.html">EPAct</a> Section 409</strong>
<br>EPAct Section 409 authorizes federal-to-state assistance and incentive programs to 
accelerate the introduction and use of <a href="http://www.ott.doe.gov/program/oaat/afv.html">
alternative fuels and vehicles</a>.  Two million 
dollars has been allocated to fund 19 state pilot programs.

<p><strong>The following programs are part of DOE's <em><a href="/partnering/epse">
Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy</a></em></strong>

<p><strong><a href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#Homes">Energy Partnerships for Affordable Homes</a>
</strong>

<p>DOE is working with the Home Energy Rating System Council (a collaborative nationwide 
group), and with six states that have operating home energy rating systems, to expand the 
infrastructure and market penetration of both energy efficient retrofits and new 
construction by encouraging strategic alliances with mortgage lenders, the secondary 
mortgage market, builders, realtors, appraisers and utilities.  It is expected that all 
50 states will be participants in this program by 2000.

<p><strong><a href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#America">Rebuild America</a></strong>
<br>In conjunction with state and local governments and energy offices, DOE will provide 
seed funding for community-based public/private sector partnerships to accelerate energy 
efficiency improvements in existing commercial and multifamily buildings.

<p><strong><a href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#Wise">Climate Wise</a></strong>
<br>State and local governments are among the partners in this program, which is designed 
to help commercial and industrial businesses reap the economic and environmental benefits 
of innovative energy efficiency and waste reduction technologies.  The target for this 
program is to have over 300 participants by 2000.

<p><strong><a href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#NICE">NICE3:  National Industrial Competitiveness 
through Energy, Environment, Economics</a></strong>
<br>NICE3 is a cost-sharing grant program operated by DOE and EPA offering grants to 
industries to develop or demonstrate advances in energy efficiency and clean production.  
Industries must apply through State Energy Offices.

<p><strong><a href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#Codes">Update Commercial and Residential Building 
Codes</a></strong>
<br>DOE provides competitive grants to states to update, craft, implement, train personnel 
and sustain energy efficiency measures in state building codes for commercial and 
residential buildings.

<p><strong><a href="/partnering/epse/95yerhtm.html#Resource">Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)</a>
</strong>
<br>DOE provides states and utilities with educational tools, workshops, support for 
collaboratives, critical issue papers, supportive research and direct technical assistance 
to institute IRP for utilities.
