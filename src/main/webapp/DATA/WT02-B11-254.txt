REDWOOD CITY, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1995 SEP 18 (NB) -- VeriFone Inc.<br>
(NYSE: VFI) has released the results of a market study to assess<br>
merchant and consumer attitudes toward commerce over the Internet.<br>
VeriFone, who just announced its entry into the Internet payment<br>
industry, joined with MasterCard International and Visa International<br>
to sponsor the study.<br>
<p>
The study was conducted by Global Concepts Inc., an Atlanta-based<br>
research and consulting company specializing in the payments<br>
industry. The study consisted of three primary components: telephone<br>
interviews with 40 retailers, ranging from Fortune 500 corporations to<br>
small businesses; focus groups of consumers using online services;<br>
and an online survey of World Wide Web users.<br>
<p>
Speaking to Newsbytes, Pam Glinski, a consultant who worked on the<br>
study, said about the online survey,  "We had pointers on the Web at<br>
thirty sites directing users to our survey. Of the Web users who<br>
responded to our online survey, 32 percent said they have already<br>
bought products and services over the Internet and that 91 percent<br>
plan purchases in the future."<br>
<p>
Consumers ranked credit cards as their number one preference for<br>
making Internet purchases. Ranked on a scale of one to five points,<br>
with one being equal to respondents' "least preferred" and five<br>
representing "greatest preference," the market study found users<br>
assigning credit cards a value of 3.66 out of a total of five points.<br>
<p>
Digital cash and checking account withdrawals were not far behind,<br>
with 3.33 and 3.25 points, respectively. ATM cards, with 2.80 points,<br>
and prepaid cards, with 2.62 points, completed the list.<br>
<p>
Consumers ranked card fraud as their number one concern in<br>
making Internet purchases. Ranked on a scale of one to five points,<br>
with one being equal to respondents' "least concern" and five<br>
representing "greatest concern," the market study found concern over<br>
card fraud at 3.6 points. Card fraud was closely followed by: having<br>
to pay for previously free information, 3.3 points; lack of privacy with<br>
Internet purchases, 3.1 points; and the viability of Internet merchants<br>
at 2.9 points.<br>
<p>
In speaking about the merchant interviews, Glinski said, "Many<br>
merchants who we interviewed are waiting to take full advantage of<br>
Internet commerce until the exchange of card data is more secure.<br>
Merchants are also waiting because women over age 55 do not yet<br>
comprise a significant percentage of online shoppers.<br>
<p>
"Merchants also expressed concern over the limited bandwidth<br>
available to most consumers who are online. Slow response times,<br>
especially with graphics or photos, create a negative impression.<br>
They acknowledge that this problem is being addressed with the<br>
development of new technology," said Glinski.<br>
