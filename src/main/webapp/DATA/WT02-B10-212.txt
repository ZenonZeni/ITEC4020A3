1994 was a year for the Institute to strengthen the principles and practices of its Quality Improvement Program led by the Department of Quality Assurance. This approach combines problem solving and continuous quality improvement efforts in order to ensure quality care.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Quality Improvement (QI) activities focused on planning, measuring, assessing, and improving care in functions and processes involving clinical, administrative, support, and managerial services. A multi-disciplinary approach to reviewing and improving systems continued to be the core of comprehensive monitoring, evaluation, and preventive activities. The Medical Staff Executive Committee and the Medical Staff Organization's many multi-disciplinary committees reviewed clinical practice with active leadership and participation of the staff of the Department of Quality Assurance. Consultation and guidance regarding QI activities were provided to Nursing, Social Work, Occupational Therapy, Recreation Therapy, Pharmacy, Infection Control, Dietetic Services, Housekeeping, Safety, and Education and Training. The monitoring of research protocols was conducted by the Research Monitor under the supervision of the Director for Quality Assurance with excellent results. The Research Monitor also took on an educative role in working with the staff of the outpatient research clinics regarding documentation and had much success in this endeavor. In addition, the plan to add a Program Evaluation Specialist to the Department of Quality Assurance was realized in the fall of 1994. The Program Evaluation Specialist has been able to develop specific trending and patterning reports over time regarding several patient care processes, and, in addition, is consultant to QI teams on the preparation and analysis of data in evaluating and improving specific functions of patient care. In the latter part of 1994, a questionnaire was developed by the Program Evaluation Specialist to assess the computer literacy and training needs of the clinical staff. Educational courses are now being set up to meet these needs by the Education and Training Department.

A major organizational change occurred in March, 1994 with the establishment of a QI Council, chaired by the Director for Quality Assurance and composed of senior level representatives of various disciplines and programs. This council has become a central structure in providing leadership to promote the education of all staff in the methods and philosophy of the CQI process, in providing a forum for the identification of opportunities for improvement, in setting priorities for assessment and improvement, in identifying and convening interdepartmental teams for QI projects, and in recommending actions to improve and/or maintain improvement. The Council became the main coordinating group for carrying out the QI Program throughout the Institute. Some of the QI Projects that were initiated and completed in 1994 were: Medication Management Project, the Inpatient Adolescent Education Project, the Patient/Family Education Project, the Victims of Abuse Policy Project, and the Medical Records Documentation Project. Coping with Psychiatric Emergencies Project was begun in 1994 and is in progress.

The Department of Quality Assurance continued its responsibility for credentialing and privileging of physicians as well as for the ongoing activities of the Department of Medical Records, Education and Training, and Utilization Review. The Medical Records Department increased its staffing and therefore was able to improve the turnaround time for research requests as well as to facilitate the timeliness of Medical Records completion. The Department of Education and Training organized special educational lectures and seminars on the topics of Child and Adolescents, The Aging Process, and Trauma and Abuse, and sponsored the annual Ethics lecture on "Boundary Violations in Clinical Practice."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Much of this year's work by the Department of Quality Assurance focused on interpreting, communicating and implementing the new JCAHO Standards for the Institute. Preparation for the expected JCAHO Survey in March, 1995 was a major emphasis for the department and the Institute.
