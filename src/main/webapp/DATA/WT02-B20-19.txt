     This publication describes the use of computers to augment
the schooling and daily functions of individuals with
disabilities, and details currently available hardware and
software systems in  four areas of disability: visual impairment,
hearing and speech impairment, physical impairment, and cognitive
impairment (learning disabilities and mental retardation).  Four
uses of adaptive technology are identified that apply to all
ages: spoken and written communication; cognitive stimulation and
development; recreation, leisure, and play; and environmental
control.  Adaptive technology applications in education are
described.<P>

     Results are presented of a study on applications of
technology employed in New York City schools with students with
learning disabilities (LD).  The study explored the availability
and frequency of use of 14 types of technology, as well as 68
teachers' views on what kinds of technology would be most
helpful.  Information was obtained on: innovative uses of
technology, the quality of software available, accessibility of
computers, equipment needs for special education, and assistance
needed by teachers.  Over two-thirds of teachers reported that
they and their students typically had access only to video
recording and playback equipment and older personal computers
with limited software. <P>

     This article describes promising practices for integrating
the computer into therapeutic instruction for students with
emotional and behavioral disorders.  For students with behavior
problems, the computer can serve as an effective motivator,
provide opportunities for cooperative learning, offer social and
leisure time pursuits, and provide students the tools to engage
in self-monitoring activities.  For students with emotional
problems, the computer can facilitate self-expression, assist in
determining effective learning strategies, and build self-esteem.<P>

     This book explores the applications of assistive technology
for individuals with disabilities in school, work, and community
settings, stressing the need to keep the user of such technology
as the focus of all design, training, and implementation

postsecondary students with learning disabilities to compete
equally with nondisabled peers in the educational environment. 
Such solutions have included a variety of educational software,

Competency-based personnel preparation in early childhood

     One of nine competency-based training modules for personnel
preparation in early childhood special education, this guide
focuses on assistive technology and technological interventions
in preschool programs.  The module is adaptable for use with a
general audience, direct service personnel, or administrators. 
This module focuses on six goals: gaining an overview of
assistive technology and its curricular role; familiarity with
switch applications to increase the independent control and
participation of young children; understanding the basic use of
computers and peripherals; understanding of how computers and
peripherals can be integrated into the curriculum; gaining an
overview of augmentative and alternative communication systems,
and obtaining practical information regarding funding for
assistive technology devices and services. <P>

<b><i>Staples, A. et al.  (1993).  Uses of technology and educational
media in literacy instruction for children with developmental
disabilities.  (ED364845). 6pp.  EDRS.</b></i><BR>
     A 3-year research project, employing qualitative inquiry in
a pair of preschool and primary grade classrooms (one self-contained and one
integrated at each level), was undertaken to
examine the literacy learning difficulties of school-aged
children with developmental disabilities.  The multi-site case
studies of the first phase of the project used the constant
comparative method of data collection and analysis.  Analysis of
the first year of the project reveals two primary themes:
technology and inclusion.  Technology facilitated literacy
learning opportunities when: it was available; teachers were
competent users and programmers of the devices; and teachers had
ample time to adapt materials.  Inclusion facilitated learning
when: peers had a clear understanding of and experiences with
their roles; and the individual needs of all students were
considered. <P>

     This monograph for Maine educators presents basic
information on assistive technology devices and services and the
role of assistive technology in delivering appropriate education
to children with disabilities in the least restrictive
environment.  Questions address definitions; relevant provisions
of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA);
funding sources; alternatives to purchasing assistive technology
devices; responsibilities of schools regarding device
maintenance, repair, and replacement; relationship of devices to
medical needs; evaluation of devices or services;  and training

     This brief paper offers a systematic approach to making
decisions regarding the provision of assistive technology devices
and services for students with disabilities.  Initial questions
address which students need assistive technology, what kind of
technology is needed, and who is involved in making these
decisions.  The question about what sort of data should be
collected is answered by a proposed model, the SETT framework,
which raises a series of 16 questions about the Student, the
Environment, the Tasks, and the Tools.  A form for collecting
SETT information is attached. <P>
