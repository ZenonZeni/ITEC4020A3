Sending a Perfectly Terrible Year Into History, Yen & Stocks Soar

     Sending what was a perfectly terrible year firmly into
history, the Tokyo markets opened 1996 with a tremendous surge,
in a half day session today. The dollar climbed above Yen 105 for
the first time since June of 1994, and the stock market soared
750 points, or 3.77% to close at 20,618.00 on the Nikkei, its
highest finish since September 2, 1994. Helped along by heavy
foreign buying, about 400 million shares changed hands on the
Tokyo Exchange--close to double the volume in many full day
sessions of recent months. Stock prices had climbed sharply in
the week before shogatsu, the year-end holiday, finishing above
20,000 at midweek before dropping back a bit before the year
ended. Tokyo brokers told news agency reporters they believe
foreign buying will continue because the higher dollar will help
corporate profits, and Japanese stocks are currently underpriced
in comparison to New York and other foreign markets. It was all a
sharp contrast to last year's opening, when prices fell for five
days running and volume dropped to levels that hadn't been seen
since the early 1960s, setting a tone that persisted through much
of Japan's most troublesome year since 1945.

MoF Vice Minister Shinozawa Resigns After Just Seven Months on
Job

     In a move that jolted Kasumigaseki just as the government
was shutting down for the year-end holiday, Vice Finance Minister
Kyosuke Shinozawa resigned 12/29 after just seven months as
Japan's most powerful bureaucrat, the shortest incumbency ever.
His successor is National Tax Administration Agency director
general Tadashi Ogawa, a former administrative secretary to
Noboru Takeshita. Shinozawa said he quit to help "renovate the
hearts and minds... and lift up morale" at MoF. Both he and
Finance Minister Takemura vehemently denied he was taking
responsibility for anything specific. But reports said there was
no doubt his departure stemmed from MoF's inept handling of a
several financial crises culminating in the controversy over use
of government funds to bail the banks out from under trillions of
yen in bad debt owed by seven jusen or mortgage lenders (Digest,
12/20-22). Asahi said Shinozawa acted to prevent a politically
disruptive interrogation by the opposition Shinshinto when the
Diet reconvenes late this month. Shinshinto's new president
Ichiro Ozawa is already attacking on the issue. Persistent calls
are also heard for Takemura's head, but the Finance Minister
huffed that "My responsibility, which I have to carry out, is to
resolve the housing loan problem."
     Punishment: Shinozawa is the second vice minister in a row
to leave before his time. Predecessor Jiro Saito was forced out
in May, a month before his term was up, in what was widely
interpreted as punishment both for MoF's ineptitude and for his
connections to the political opposition. Taken together, their
departures are read as a signal that the ministry's formerly
uncontested clout is in deep decline--and more broadly, so is the
general power of Japan's almighty central bureaucracy. "I never
thought the post of Finance vice minister could be so fragile,"
one bureaucrat told Asahi. But several commentaries also observed
that one resignation or even several won't cure incompetence and
misbehavior. "The problem is that once well-functioning decision
making system made up of bureaucrats and politicians no longer
works in today's dynamically changing economy. Unless the
government and the ruling parties tackle this problem straight
forwardly, there will be no essential difference regardless of
how many vice ministers' heads fall," Yomiuri lamented.

Despite MoF Assurances on Bank Crisis, S&P, Moody's Lower Debt
Ratings

     The Finance Ministry's self-assured contention that the
jusen [mortgage lender] settlement and other actions to shore up
the financial system have finally brought the banking crisis
under control (Digest, 12/20-22), didn't cut much ice with
American rating agencies. Standard and Poor's lowered the debt
ratings of seven major Japanese banks over the year-end, and
Moody's did so on two large regionals. Affected were Mitsubishi,
Sumitomo, Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Sanwa, Fuji, its Chicago subsidiary
Heller Financial, Sakura, Industrial Bank of Japan, Hokkaido Bank
and Ashikaga Bank. S&P said bluntly that Japanese banks "remain
under considerable stress resulting from a high level of under-
reserved problem loans, exacerbated by a continuous slide in real
estate prices." The big banks, said S&P are also plagued by low
profitability, serious difficulties in foreclosing on property,
and quite possibly by exposure to the problem loans of many
smaller financial institutions. Moody's added that with property
values still falling, actual bad loan losses could well be larger
than anyone now imagines. About the only thing that will get the
banks healthy again, S&P said, is either a general economic
pickup that generates an ability among borrowers to pay, or a
turnaround in property prices.

Farm Co-op Banks Hold Yen 2 Trillion in Bad Loans To Other
Institutions

     The farm co-op banks, whose political allies limited their
losses in the collapse of the seven jusen to Yen 530 billion
($5.1 billion), are owed an additional Yen 5.1 trillion ($49.5
billion) by 68 other nonbank lenders--and more than Yen 2
trillion ($20 billion) is a dead loss, Yomiuri reported 1/1. The
paper said 27 of the lenders are paying no interest or making
reduced payments on Yen 2.23 trillion owed to the co-op banks.
Largest of the debtors is Nippon Lease, an affiliate of Long Term
Credit Bank of Japan, which owes them Yen 456.2 billion. LTCBJ
hasn't asked the co-ops to forgive any of the debt yet, Yomiuri
said, but Nichiboshin wants them to abandon some of the Yen 41.8
billion it owes, and Yen 21.3 billion owed by Hyogin Factor, a
subsidiary of bankrupt Hyogo Bank, is gone. Largest single lender
among the co-ops is their central bank, Norinchukin, with Yen
551.9 billion outstanding, but the National Federation of
Agricultural Co-op Mutual Aid Associations and its 47 prefectural
chapters hold Yen 720.3 billion in loans among them, while
separate prefectural co-op associations hold the remaining Yen
609.7 billion.

Leading Indicators Climbed To 80, But Other Statistics Are Mixed
Bag

     The index of leading indicators climbed to 80 on a scale of
100 in October, the Economic Planning Agency reported 12/26. That
was its first trip in six months over 50, the point at which it
theoretically begins to predict expansion 6-9 months hence. But
other statistics reported over the year end, many of them
November numbers, were mixed at best, with a majority of them
still pointing down. Details:
     -- Retail sales by major department stores and supermarkets
fell 0.5% from a year ago in November, to Yen 1.84 trillion, MITI
said. Department stores gained 0.1% to Yen 904 billion but
supermarkets fell 1.1% to Yen 932 billion. October sales had
fallen 3.2%.
     -- The Prime Minister's office said consumer prices through
November averaged 0.7% below a year ago, and added that if the
trend continued through December Japan would have seen its first
full year of deflation since 1958. Prices in Tokyo were actually
off 0.5% from a year ago in December.
     -- November industrial production gained 0.5% from a year
ago, MITI reported 12/27, adding that manufacturers it surveyed
reported plans to raise output in December and January. Chief
statistician Harumi Takahashi told reporters she expects 4th
quarter output to gain 0.9% from a year ago. "Industrial
production is better than we had expected," she said.
     -- New construction orders to 50 major companies in November
fell 10.4% from a year ago to Yen 1.4 trillion yen, the
Construction Ministry reported 12/27.
     -- MOC also said November housing starts gained 0.1% from a
year ago to 137,180, the first rise after eight months of
decline. Private homes fell 8% to 45,953 and company housing
dropped 2.8% to 2,314, but rental units gained 2.6% to 56,040--
and housing for sale (mainly condos) climbed 9.4% to 32,862.
     -- MITI said 12/25 it forecasts crude steel production will
fall 9.2% from a year ago to 23.2 million tons in the first
quarter of 1996.
     -- November unemployment climbed to 3.4% after six months at
3.2% (see Labor).

Ozawa Wins Shinshinto Presidency in a Walk, But Unity is a
Question

     Longtime behind-the-throne power broker Ichiro Ozawa moved a
long step toward putting himself in the seat of authority by
defeating erstwhile ally Tsutomu Hata 2-to-1 for the presidency
of Shinshinto, 12/28. Ozawa got into the race only after Hata's
people started to talk about removing him as secretary general, a
spot he'd held since he organized the party. But with a little
help from his friends in organized labor and other local groups,
he managed in two weeks to put together a 1,120,012 to 566,998
rout of the former prime minister. That tally included anybody
willing to pony up Yen 1,000 ($10) for the right to cast a
ballot. Among the 223,578 regular party members, Ozawa garnered
only a slim margin. Most commentary approved his enunciation of
clear policy proposals, over Hata's emphasis on consensus-
building, and suggested that once LDP President Hashimoto takes
over from Prime Minister Murayama, Japan will finally return to
real politics.
     No Shutting Up: Always provided Ozawa can hold his forces
together. Neither Hata nor his allies seem in a mood to shut up
and follow the leader. About 15 Hata supporters, including former
Prime Minister Hosokawa, said they'll organize yet another "study
group" (read incipient faction). Ozawa put Hata, former prime
ministers Hosokawa and Kaifu, and other senior politicians on a
board of senior advisors, but several said they will continue to
criticize him. He named as his secretary general Takashi Yonezawa
who once held the same job in the old Democratic Socialist party,
and who had delivered the union vote for Ozawa. He kept follower
Kozo Watanabe as Political Affairs chairman, but coopted longtime
critic Kazuo Aichi, a Hata man, as policy chairman, and named
another Hata backer, former postal minister Hajime Funada as his
political affairs deputy.

Dietman Yamaguchi Indicted for Illegal Loans from Failed Credit
Associations

     Tokyo prosecutors indicted former Labor Minister Toshio
Yamaguchi 12/27 on embezzlement, fraud and other charges,
culminating a year's investigation into financial irregularities
of two defunct Tokyo credit co-ops, Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen.
Yamaguchi is accused of conspiring with former Tokyo Kyowa
director Harunori Takahashi to get Yen 2.7 billion in unsecured
loans that are in default. The fraud charge stems from a
conspiracy to extract Yen 180 million from Kumamoto Engineering
University, ostensibly to help build the `Washington
International University' project in Reston, VA., though there
was no prospect of construction. Those funds also went to pay off
debts of his family firm. He is also accused of using assets of
non-profit foundations he created as collateral for other loans
from the two credit co=ops--and of perjuring himself before the
Diet by testifying that he knew nothing of the conspiracies.
Prosecutors said their year-long investigation of the two
institutions uncovered Yen 38.2 billion in illegal loans to a
variety of people, a record in a Japanese bank fraud case.

Report That Murayama Agreed to Hand Power to Hashimoto Is Denied

     Yomiuri reported 12/31 that Prime Minister Murayama has
secretly agreed to hand his office over to LDP president Ryutaro
Hashimoto in April, but Murayama himself denied it, and perhaps
more important, so far you've read it in Yomiuri, and nowhere
else. Murayama told reporters at a year-end press conference he
plans to go to Lyon, France for the next G7 summit in June. He
added that there's no plan to dissolve the Diet. Yomiuri had said
Murayama, Hashimoto and Finance Minister Takemura, hashed up a
deal to make the switch after the FY '96 budget passes the Diet
this spring, and to have Hashimoto call an election about three
months later, giving the Murayama's Socialists and Takemura's
Sakigake party time to prepare. The paper said the switch might
not happen until late April because President Clinton is due to
visit April 17-18, and Murayama is going to an atomic energy
summit in Moscow April 19.

Clinton Reschedules Japan Visit for April 17

     The White House said 12/26 that President Clinton
rescheduled his state visit to Japan April 17-18, on his way to
Moscow to see Boris Yeltsin and attend the atomic energy summit.
Clinton canceled a trip in November for the ASEAN summit and a
follow on visit to Tokyo because of the U.S. government shutdown.
Main purpose of the visit is to issue a joint declaration that
the U.S.-Japan security relationship is intact and should remain
so despite the end of the Cold War and a measure of public
unhappiness with the presence of U.S. troops, exacerbated by the
Okinawa rape.

Lockheed Martin, Timken, Other U.S. Firms Plan Joint Japan
Business Base

     Lockheed Martin, Timken and other U.S. firms are laying
plans to establish a joint business base in Japan that they hope
will allow them to serve the Japanese market better while keeping
costs to a minimum, Nihon Keizai reported. So far, seven firms
including Caterpillar, Cooper Automotive, and electrical parts
maker AMP have agreed to join, and the group wants to attract at
least 20 companies before making a firm go-ahead decision. But it
already has the unreserved support of MITI and is likely to get
both tax breaks and a low-interest loan from the Japan
Development Bank to execute the project, Nikkei said. The
planners are looking for a 30-year lease on 20,000-30,000 sq.m.
(215-325,000 sq.ft.) of floor space that could be subdivided into
individual company offices, small R&D facilities, design shops,
conference rooms and an exhibit hall for joint use. Even
companies that already have offices in Japan would benefit from
using the joint facilities, the paper said. The group is working
with MITI and local governments to pick a location early this
year, and is looking hard at Yokohama and Kobe, Nikkei said.

Nissan Will Move All Sentra Assembly To Mexico, Export Altima
from U.S.

     Struggling to stanch its cash hemorrhage in Mexico, Nissan
will move all assembly of Sentra sedans for the U.S. market from
Smyrna, Tenn. to its plant in Aguascalientes, while raising
output of the Altima in Tennessee so it can export 30-40,000 a
year to Japan. A separate report said it will also restart
production of the AD Van at Aguascalientes, mainly for export to
Japan. Nihon Keizai said 12/23 the Sentra shift will be completed
by 1998, when the car is due for its next major model changeover.
Smyrna currently makes about 170,000 Sentras a year, so the
switch would just about bring the Mexican plant up to capacity.
It made 100,000 last year, vs. a capacity of 270,000. It already
makes an earlier version of the Sentra, which Nissan sells in
Latin America under the same Sunny nameplate it uses in Japan.
The company itself announced 12/27 it plans to resume production
of the AD in Mexico for export to its home market.
     NAFTA: Nihon Keizai said the main motive for the shift is to
take advantage of both NAFTA rules and lower costs in Mexico
generated by the declining value of the peso. Decision to export
the Altima from Tennessee, the paper added, is meant to short
circuit organized labor and other opponents of NAFTA. The switch
will help Nissan make use of a plant that became a white elephant
when the peso collapsed. Nissan borrowed heavily in dollars to
enlarge Aguascalientes--and banking on continued prosperity in
Mexico, it even quit exporting the Mexican-made AD home to Japan.
But the Mexican auto market disintegrated: sales are now 30-40%
of year ago levels, and that helped generate Yen 60 billion ($600
million) losses in Mexico last year and this. What isn't clear,
Nikkei said, is whether it will help the company's bottom line.
Given competition from the Toyota Avalon and Honda Accord,
Nissan's U.S.-made Altimas could well wind up eating into sales
of its own domestic plants.

Pressured By Fearful Koreans, Ssangyong Scrubs Plan To Start
Sales in Japan

     Under stiff pressure from Korean makers and officials
fearful that its action could force Seoul to open its domestic
market to Japanese autos, Ssangyong Motor scrapped plans to sell
its Mercedes-designed Musso sport utility in Japan this month,
Nihon Keizai reported 12/30. The company had said it planned to
become the first Korean automaker into the Japanese market with a
location in Nagoya and plans to expand its dealer network
nationwide within 2-3 years (Digest, 12/11). The paper didn't
give details of exactly what happened in Seoul, but said that
Ssangyong, currently the midget of the Korean auto industry (it
made 50,000 Mussos in 1995, and exported 15,000), ran head-on
into worries that its action would give Tokyo an excuse to demand
that the Korean market be opened. The Koreans lifted some import
barriers effective Jan. 1, but the impact will be felt mainly in
the luxury and semi-luxury categories, while the bread-and-butter
market for sedans with engines under 3 liters will be left mainly
untouched. There was also some worry, Nikkei said, that if the
Korean market is fully opened, Japanese makers like Nissan and
Mazda who've been selling technology to the Koreans as a way to
get into the market, might be tempted to cancel the arrangements
and start sales on their own.

Japanese Makers Bought $10.3 Billion of U.S. Parts in FY '95
First Half

      Japanese makers bought a record $10.3 billion worth of U.S.
automotive parts in the first half of FY '95, ended Sept. 30, up
8.3% from the year ago period, the Japan Auto Manufacturers
Association reported. The figure was about $800 million above the
previous record, set in FY '94. About $8.7 billion of the parts
were for use on transplant assembly lines in the U.S., up 8% from
FY '94, and imports for domestic operations totaled $1.65
billion, up 9.8%. Although Japanese makers, with MITI's backing,
refused to set a new industry-wide parts purchasing target during
the autos and parts negotiations that ended in June, the figure
would seem to indicate a substantial increase for all of FY '95,
from the $19.9 billion they bought in FY '94. A JAMA briefer
warned, however, that declining vehicle exports, which are
knocking down production, could limit parts imports.

Hurt By Exports, November Domestic Vehicle Output Plunged 9.1%

     Stung by a rapid fall in exports stemming from the high yen
and rising output abroad, Japanese vehicle makers reported a 9.1%
plunge in November domestic output, to 863,460. It was a sixth
straight monthly drop, and among the big five, Nissan was the
only gainer, the Japan Auto Manufacturers' Association said. The
figure included 655,067 cars, down 5.7%, 204,047 trucks, off
18.9%, and 4,346 buses, up 8.1%. The decline was all in exports,
which plummeted 21%. Domestic sales gained 4.6% to 593,073, and
passenger cars were up 7% to 380,405. For all but Nissan, which
gained 7.6% to 143,448 on the strength of a domestic surge, the
results were bleak. Toyota hurt by falling exports to North and
South America and the Middle East, dropped 11.2% to 277,194.
Mazda, as usual, got hurt worst in percentage terms, off 24.9% to
65,789. Mitsubishi fell 15.4% to 106,581, and Honda, whose
domestic sales actually climbed 18.6%, saw production fall 9.5%
to 81,425 because of lower exports. Overall, production for the
first 11 months totaled 9,423,306, off 2.8% from a year earlier,
and JAMA said it projects the fully year total at around 10.2
million, which would represent a 2.4% drop from 1994.

Monju Coverup Officials Demoted; Fast Breeder Program To Be
`Rethought'

     The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp. or
Donen said 12/23 it removed from duty four officials involved in
an effort to cover up the extent of the Monju reactor's
disastrous leak of three tons of sodium coolant (Digest, 12/22).
Donen had acknowledged that Monju operations director Yasutami
Omori and deputy Isao Sato conspired to cut 14 minutes from a
gruesome, 15-minute videotape of the accident scene. They gave
the 1-minute tape to TV stations the day after the accident, and
released an additional four minutes two days later, saying it was
newly shot. The Donen director in charge of Monju, Tadao
Takahashi, and a lower level official were also demoted. Reports
called the action highly unusual, especially since the reactor is
shut down and the investigation isn't finished. Some accounts
treated it as a ploy by Donen to get people who know too much out
of the way. "Why do they have to make personnel changes now?...To
find out what happened, it's better to leave those who were in
charge in place," Fukui governor Yukio Kurita told reporters.
     Rethinking: Asahi reported 1/1 that Atomic Energy Commission
has decided to "rethink" the entire fast breeder program, which
happens to be the centerpiece of Japan's long-term nuclear energy
policy. The Monju experiment was supposed to lead to construction
of another and bigger fast breeder a decade hence, and commercial
operation of plutonium-fueled reactors by 2030. AEC, which is
headed by Science and Technology Agency Director Yasuoki Urano,
thinks Monju and its aftermath necessitate formation of "a new
national consensus," Asahi said.

Tomen, B&W to Build Nuclear Waste Disposal Plant for Old Russian
Submarines

     With funding from the Japanese government, Tomen and Babcock
& Wilcox will build a facility to process nuclear waste extracted
from old Russian submarines, Nihon Keizai reported 12/31. The
Russian Navy was found dumping used submarine reactor coolant in
the Sea of Japan in 1993 to Japan's great dismay (Digest 10/19-
22/93). The incident led Tokyo to agree to spend about $100
million in foreign aid funds to help Russia find a better way to
dispose of the waste. The fund, now managed by a joint Japanese-
Russian commission, will pay Tomen and B&W to build a Yen 2.5
billion ($25 million) floating disposal plant, to be moored next
to a submarine dismantling facility in Vladivostok. It will have
an annual processing capacity of 7,000 cubic meters of waste--
enough to process all waste coming from the submarines--5,000-
6,000 cubic meters a year--plus what's stored on land in the Far
East. Prime Minister Murayama will formally announce the project
during an atomic energy safety conference in Moscow April 19-20,
Nikkei said.

Hitachi Plans Yen 230 Billion in Chip Ventures in Singapore,
Kuala Lumpur

     Hitachi is planning Yen 230 billion ($2.2 billion) worth of
new chip ventures in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur that would high
density memories and CMOS chips, Nihon Keizai reported. The Yen
100 billion Singapore venture, with Nippon Steel and the Economic
Development Board of Singapore, will be capable of processing 20-
30,000 eight inch wafers a month to make 16-and 64-meg DRAMs
starting in mid-1998, the paper said. It would be Nippon Steel's
first venture into overseas electronics production. The company,
like much of the rest of the steel industry, has been trying to
diversify into electronics for several years, but without a whole
lot of success so far. The Kuala Lumpur project, a joint venture
with South Korea's LG Semicon, will build a Yen 130 billion chip
plant capable of processing 30,000 8-inch CMOS wafers a month
with 0.3 micron technology. The Malaysian news agency Bernama
said it will be located at Kulim, Kedah. The venture is due to be
organized in the spring, but when production would actually begin
wasn't given. In Tokyo Hitachi said Singapore venture will
eventually create 1,000 jobs.

Takara Drops Plan To Write Software for Nintendo `Virtual Boy'

     The Takara gameware house said it dropped plans to write
software for Nintendo's `Virtual Boy' 3D game machine. The
company wouldn't discuss the reason, but rival gameware house
Taito has also dropped the project because sales of the machine
have been poor. The headset machine produces a red and black line
image.

NEC Develops Flash Voice Card Able To Store 30 Minutes of Talk

     NEC announced development of a 32-meg flash memory sound
storage card called the "Chip Whisper" that can hold up to 30
minutes of digitized conversation. NEC said the card, which
weighs 100 grams (3-1/2 oz) is capable of giving random access to
its contents. With additional chips it can store up to 4 hours of
talk, the company said. NEC said 12/26 it will offer the system
to museums and exhibitions, and believes the technology could
also be used in personal digital assistants.

U.S. Proposes Joint Electronics Weapons Component R&D With Japan

     The Pentagon has proposed a joint R&D program with Japan on
parts that go into weapons used by both countries, Yomiuri
reported 1/1. The proposal was made during bilateral talks in
October and November, and what the Pentagon has in mind is mainly
the electronics that go into such systems as the F-15 fighter,
the P3C anti-submarine patrol plane, and Aegis series destroyers
and cruisers, the paper said. While the U.S. objective is mainly
to share R&D costs, the Defense Agency also sees benefit in such
projects: They would increase interchangeability of weapons and
help deflect criticism about the one-way flow of weapons
technology from the U.S. to Japan, Yomiuri said. But the agency
also wants to limit the proposal for now to "research" rather
than "development" because it's worried that Socialist and
Sakigake politicians in the ruling coalition may object to it as
a violation of Japan's long-standing ban on weapons exports.

Jobless Rate Hit 3.4% in November; Miyazaki Claims It May Signal
`Recovery'

     The unemployment rate jumped to a new post-war high of 3.4%
in November, up 0.2% from where it had rested since June, the
Management and Coordination Agency announced 12/26. Particularly
hard hit were first-time job seekers aged 15-24, for whom the
rate was 6%, up from 4.8% a year ago. That's consistent with
other surveys indicating the difficulty next spring's high school
and college graduates face in finding jobs. But the Labor
Ministry also issued a contradictory statistic, showing a
fractional rise to 0.63 in the ratio of job openings to job
seekers, from 0.61 in October. That led a Labor Ministry briefer
to theorize that with the economy now out of the darkest part of
the tunnel, some people are deliberately quitting to look for
better jobs. As evidence he noted an MCA survey that showed
850,000 of the 2.18 million unemployed in November, up 100,000
from a year ago, said they'd quit of their own volition. The
number forced out of work was 560,000, up just 60,000. Economic
Planning Agency Minister Isamu Miyazaki ventured that "A rise in
the jobless rate can sometimes be seen in the initial stage of an
economic recovery." Still, Miyazaki predicted the jobless rate
will hover at 3-4% "for some time." Because most big companies
seem determined to continue "restructuring" workers out the door,
the Labor Ministry is planning "consultations" with the managers
of up and coming venture businesses to encourage them to raise
employment, Asahi and Nihon Keizai reported.

Matsushita to Begin Hiring in Fall as Well as Spring

     Matsushita will recruit in the fall as well as the spring
starting next year, to make it easier to hire experienced workers
and graduates returning from study abroad, Nihon Keizai reported
12/31. Though the Itoyokado supermarket chain started hiring in
the fall last September, and competitor Seiyu said recently it
will begin taking on people year round, Matsushita is one of the
first industrial companies to do so, Nikkei said. The example, it
added, may encourage other manufacturers to break up a rigid,
decades-old hiring pattern, in which almost all new workers start
their jobs April 1. Matsushita plans to take on 600-700 employees
in 1997, up from 500 each last year and this. About half the
increase, or up to 100 people, will be taken on in the fall. Sony
has been hiring a handful of returning graduates from abroad in
the fall, and Kao began offering research and sales jobs in the
autumn, last year.

Mitsubishi Corp. To Abolish Clerical Track for Women

     In a step toward gender equality in the workplace generated
as much by office automation as by sentiment, Mitsubishi Corp.
will abolish the long-standing jimu-shoku, or "clerical track"
under which thousands of women worked at low pay, with no hope of
advancement, Nihon Keizai reported. The trading giant will set
aside up to one third of its new-hire slots for women, the paper
said. But more important, Mitsubishi will encourage some of the
2,800 clerical-track women already on its payroll either to join
their 6,500 male colleagues on the sogo-shoku "comprehensive
[career] track," or to get on a new intermediate career track it
will create.  The reason, said Nikkei, is that personal computers
now perform many functions previously handled by clerks, making
the women redundant. If and when additional clerical help is
needed in future, the company will use temps, Nikkei said. The
plan, the paper added, is likely to be copied by other big
companies considering women for serious work. There is a
downside, however, in that it will reduce the total number of
female hires, making it even tougher for young women to find
employment, Nikkei said.

Population Growth in 1995 Fell To Lowest Level of Post-war Era

     With fewer births and more deaths, Japan's population grew
at the slowest rate in 50 years during 1995, the Health and
Welfare Ministry said 12/31. Based on Jan.-October figures, the
ministry estimated there were 1.123 million live births during
the year, down 45,000 from 1994, and the second lowest post-war
figure, after 1993. That translates into 9.6 births per 1,000
Japanese, about the same level as in 1993. Meantime deaths rose
40,000 from 1994 to 916,000, the highest figure since 1950. The
figures were particularly high in the first quarter because of
the Kobe earthquake Jan. 17, and a flu epidemic that struck last
winter. As a result, the population grew only 277,000, or 10.6%
less than the 310,000 recorded in 1993. There is a slight hope
for more births this year, based on the fact that there were
784,000 marriages in 1995, up 1,000 from 1994. The increase may
have been generated by a confluence of dates: This was the
seventh year of Heisei, Emperor Akihito's reign, and July 7th, or
Tanabata, is a romantic date in Japanese astrology. Yomiuri said
about 30,000 couples arranged to marry on that day so the date on
their marriage certificates would be "7/7/7."
