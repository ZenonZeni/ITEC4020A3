<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>the best!
<LI>Sex on Internet can be educating
<LI>Don't look at it if you don't like it. Parents should take responsibility for their kids, and everyone else can kiss my ass.  I don't like republicans, but i can't @%#&! ban them.
<LI>i love every bit of it
<LI>Sex on the net is like sex in life, either you are looking for it or you are not.It doesn't find you! Chat areas are more easliy abused and in need of monitoring more than the net itself.
<LI>Sex exists.  What do you think caused the boom in VCR's?  If it wasn't for Adult videos there wouldn't be one in every house, and Blockbuster would never have existed.  The big "problem" is noone has figured out how to make money on Sex.net at a corporate
<LI>Politicians need to get a grip of their own sexuality!
<LI>no comment
<LI>It's no big deal. Sex is everywhere, just turn on a T.V. talk show. Maybe if people would face reality they would realize it's a part of life and most often a healthy way to have some fun.
<LI>Open mindedness and freedom of choice
<LI>Sex is great, but not on the net.
<LI>it should be free to access by adults and manture indivusals
<LI>it's odd, i don't have a lot of experience with it, but it's intriguing.
<LI>haven't had much experience there. kind of strange, though. how do type and masterbate, that must be a good trick! also i think it's a way to avoid real contact and real responsibility. but to each his/her own.each his own
<LI>I'm a libertarian. The government should keep its nose out
<LI>great to have cybersex on the IRC
<LI>I think that sex on the net could act as an educational tool as well as a very good entertainment tool.
<LI>The Internet has been, and should continue to be, the truest example of free speech in the world.
<LI>it's ok
<LI>keep the net free
<LI>It's cool
<LI>I think sex and the internet should go hand in hand!  It is very appropraite, it keeps kooks and wackos off the streets and in their homes...
<LI>Extraordinary- jibber jibber kerplunk kerplunk whoops
<LI>If all sex related sites were required to have some sort of flag, then parents or teachers could block out access to these sites for underage viewers.  To flag your own site would have to be a law enforced by some observing commission (volunteer internet, local government, state government, or maybe federal).  The flags could come in levels of exposer G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17 and  X.  G stands for suitable for very young children, say age 8 and below, where PG stands for suitable viewing between ages 8 a
d 13 (puberty).  All of the URL's or FTP sites would then be assigned a sutiable flag by the monitoring body just like the motion picture monitoring body.  Then access to certain flags could be blocked out.   
<LI>I love it....if it weren't for it, I probably wouldn't be on it!!
<LI>I think adults should be allowed to view what they like.
<LI>Parents need to control access to sexually explicit material concerning their children.
<LI>it's fine as long as it's available to only adults
<LI>it's kinky and I love it.
<LI>it totally kicks ass
<LI>I like sex on the net. I like the privacy on viewing in my own home. I can view what I want and when I want it. I'm just curious about certain things and I can look them up.
<LI>IT's Entertaining.
<LI>it's sad if people have to use it instead of real sex
<LI>it's great
<LI>The majority are been opressed by the right - as usual
<LI>It works to my advantage because I can find out about other people other than myself and in that way improve myself.
<LI>As far as children gaining access, I believe that it really is a non-issue.
<LI>It is highly encouraged.
<LI>Needs more stuff about foot fetishes
<LI>Pointless
<LI>sex is a wonderful thing
<LI>I think it is a personal thing.  I'm sure there is some way to limit under age persons from seeing the pornography but curiosity gets most people
<LI>i think it is silly once you've seen pictures it not that exciting,hard to find specifics
<LI>screw till you puke
<LI>i think some people take it too far
<LI>Rock on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I love it, it gives me a hardon
<LI>No different than walking into your corner store and buying Playboy or Penthouse
<LI>Almost everyone likes sex, so it is natural to find it on th Net
<LI>Too commercial, promotes sex as a business, not as the wonderful experience it can be.
<LI>it is by my observation ok...i do think that children should be able to learn about sex via this but not have access to anything other than ed
<LI>Having sex related sites on the internet is healthy for a variety of reasons. It can be enlightening, entertaining and purely decadent. There is, of course, material that is highly offensive (necrophilia, pedophila and bestiality, for example), but the bad must be taken with the good. The internet may be the most important way to understand sociey as a whole. We can't censor society, so why censor the internet?
<LI>more action videos!  But seriously, hard core pornography is not really all that accesable (I know, I tried!!!!)
<LI>It's cool!
<LI>Not enough surveys, as they are very enjoyable!
<LI>Get the government out of the business of legislating "morality". That power must rest with the individual. It is the Parent's sole resposibility to monitor their own children. 
<LI>I love it - its not easy to go into a shop and buy sex-related stuff - this is much more fun!
<LI>They are both educational and necessary.
<LI>Not enough
<LI>A rating system for parents to block stuff would work like that of satelite TV.
<LI>I think that censorship of any kind is wrong. We should be able choose if we are capable of handling the sexual material on our own.
<LI>I can't get enough!!!
<LI>I think it is not wholesome or productive.
<LI>its there if you have a credit card handy!
<LI>Sex is a part of our being and groups trying to hide it have greater things to hide.
<LI>I love to download beastiality photos on the net
<LI>great
<LI>Easy way to waste alot of time and not accomplish anything
<LI>sex-good. internet-good. sex on the internet-better
<LI>wish there was more.
<LI>I like pictures, wish there were more that were free to view
<LI>Graphic, honest, and liberal
<LI>I want more hard porn, some teens would be nice too.
<LI>The stories are great, but if I want pics I´ll buy a mag or watch a movie.
<LI>freedom of speech is a right - censorship sucks!
<LI>just look
<LI>Listen, if it helps to keep the access available, great, I HATE the thought of ANY government agency watching out FOR ME.  I'll take care of myself.
<LI>basic information
<LI>boring!!!!!!!
<LI>I don't see the harm in sex! What's the big deal here? Sex is as natural as anything else we do.  I don't seem to understand why it would be worse to watch nudity than violence (seen a movie lately?). Watch Kama Sutra with you partner and enjoy the plesure of love and sex...
<LI>I like the most of it...
<LI>I like it a lot
<LI>All I can say is thanks it exists, I can't bring myself to buy playboy or penthouse at the newstand!
<LI>boring
<LI>Too many pay sites. Should be free <grin>
<LI>You can find it on the Net
<LI>let the shit fly!!
<LI>Sex: great!  Internet: I'm not impressed!
<LI>need to be open
<LI>It adds an exciting dimension to crusing the internet
<LI>Sex is part of human culture and I think its ridiculous to try to hide that fact.  I would rather that parents be held responsible for controlling their childrens access to ANY aspect of the NET.  Given a choice I would even let my children look at sex sites than violent sites.  I would also rather them look at playboy than listen to a closed minded religious broadcaster.  He or she can believe what they want but I have the same right!
<LI>It's OK, I cannot understand, why we have to talk so much about this...
<LI>I think that sexual content on the internet is ok.  I think that PARENTS should watch what their kids do.   I mean there is programs that censor the ponographic webb sites.  So, I think that everything should be put back on the net as before.
<LI>it´s okay
<LI>I've done a little research and some of what I've seen is disgusting. But, I do not believe in censorship under any circumstances.
<LI>it is enjoying and open for all who want to have access to it not those who don't like it.
<LI>i think it is a great supply of entertainment
<LI>Its great! You can meet people who just want to fuck your brains out and I LOVE talking dirty to them.
<LI>it has improved my masturbation sessions, isn't really hard to find but hidden enough to give people a free choice of seeing it or not. The only problem is that as a REAL female, loving sex, there too many frustrated guys. I could write a whole story or  opninion about what i would like and what kinda people and chats, but that would take to much space. You can find nice guys, have fun with them and masturbate but they are rather a minority.
<LI>I think its ok ;)
<LI>I thinkthe internet is great, there is always bad mixed in the good
<LI>I think it is wonderful!!
<LI>It,s fine for adults,who can choos to use it.
<LI>I whish i could find more on it i have not found too much
<LI>It is very interesting
<LI>Drugs, budget problems, health care, racial tension, underemployment, education... there are so many more pressing and more difficult issues.  So the politicians gotta have an easy target to make it look like they are doing something....
<LI>I think its perversion, but the government needs to let people make their own decisions.
<LI>It appears to be harmless fun, so far
<LI>I find the general search for companionship a socially acceptable aspect of the net, so since sex is part of that whole, I disagree with censorship. But I find some of this (bestiality, pedophilia and hard core S & M) unwarranted, unnatural and disgusting.
<LI>don't know yet, will find out
<LI>Internet is only a new media, with more possibility
<LI>no comment
<LI>It's a great experience.  It allows me to say things that I wouldn't be able to someone face-to-face.  My wife gets more sleep this way..
<LI>I think its there if you want it
<LI>I'm new at this.  I've found nothing "free" of porographic nature.  The few areas I've searched are (justifiably) asking one to buy a membership. Seems as though this should control  the situation.
<LI>It is a freedom that should be left up to the person or parents, not the gov. or others
<LI>yippee
<LI>Nothing is done on the internet that isn't done in the real world!
<LI>The fear of sex on the net is a case of mass hysteria
<LI>Think ppl looking for cybersex have no life!
<LI>an easy way to have discreet cahts with people that wish to do the same.
<LI>don't think much of it
<LI>great
<LI>Against all form of censorship on the net or usenet.
<LI>freedom of speech
<LI>It is a great way to releave fustrations without any string attached
<LI>It is nice to be able to live out my sex life safely and enjoyabley
<LI>I wish more personal home pages would warn you of sexual content before displaying it.
<LI>I believe that it is the public's right to view this material if they so choose.
<LI>It has been a wonderful improvement to my masturbation!!!
<LI>It's a matter of choice for the individual; To read or not to read that is the question
<LI>Sex is a natural thing and should not be hiden behind closed doors
<LI>what is inappropriate for a teenager on the net?  there is really nothing here that they cannot find somewhere else! 
<LI>I think Internet should be fully open for everybody and everything, Kids should be protected by there parents.
<LI>I love it, although sometimes I spend far too much time scanning around instead of working
<LI>the bill that just passed is horrendous
<LI>As in real life, I think consenting adults should be allowed to do what they wish. As for the children, I feel the government should let mommy and daddy do the parenting.
<LI>we should not fear any human behavior
<LI>interesting
<LI>it wouldn't be a problem if parents would get a clue, and do what they are supposed to do... watch their kids, and make sure they grow up right.  it's the parents fault the kids grow up F##KED in the head
<LI>a good alternative for some people
<LI>I belive that it is generally good. For inhibited married couples it is a great learning experience!!
<LI>usefull
<LI>I love it!
<LI>too 'hot' a topic/rather irrelevant inn light of other societal ills/net access is limited and particularly restricted by socioeconomic factors/if it was a 'poor' people issue, it would not receive the attention
<LI>The sex on the net is not very important so let it be !!!!
<LI>It is there, big deal.  People put too much emphasis on the taboos of sexuality in the United States.  That taboo itself is more damaging than the material.  Regulation is a terrible idea.
<LI>Porn could be scrambled ,and be uns
<LI>I'm glad many of the resources are out there and while I don't generally get into NetPorn much I don't think it should be censored for mature adults
<LI>What the fuck could I say - let us see more ...
<LI>It is being used properly at present.
<LI>It is fine with me.  Parents need to take some responsibility and maybe teach their kids a few things.  Why should my rights be deleted because some parents are upset that their kids saw pornography on the net cause the parent did not regulate and watch their kids?  It is not nessasary the fact it is sex.  No the thing that bugs me is that the gov. is again, shrinking our rights.  What will ie be next, a manual on how to talk politicaly correct?  I hate censorship, no matter what the maturial is.  
<LI>I think parents should start acting like parents and start taking care of there kids. I'm not a kid any more and I resent the government telling me what I can view or read when I am of legal age to see sexually explicit material if I wish.
<LI>I'm glad it's there--which is different from saying it's everywhere.
<LI>good for when there's no one else around
<LI>you gotta love it man!
<LI>It should be left alone! If kids want it, they'll find it. Here, or on the smut magazine under their dads bed. Where's the difference? The net should be left open to all aspects!
<LI>It's kind of fun once in a while!
<LI>Sex is wonderful between a MAN and a WOMAN.  Enjoy it and shut up!
<LI>It allows for privacy in one's own home for people to get information about all aspects of sex and related topics concerning safe sex and diseases.  It is great for shy people who would never ask the questions or buy books to get the information they need.
<LI>It's not all it's cracked up to be. Some pictures and a lot 
<LI>It's there, and you can't really stop it.  I don't care for it, but you can't really do anything at all.
<LI>You have to search to find it.  There is too much hype about nothing.  Those yelling the loudest are probably those who don't even search for Sex on the internet
<LI>Some of it goes a little to far!
<LI>I believe that censorship of any kind is wrong.
<LI>Wish there was more. Government needs to keep out!!!
<LI>It's good, why not.
<LI>thank you...from me and my lover!
<LI>I think the goverment should just let it be.
<LI>Great thing!
<LI>Sex online is like most things in life as good or as bad as the people who use or abuse the system.
<LI>it's  O.K.
<LI>I believe that we are only begining to see a whole new set of laws coming into effect reguarding the internet and soon enough there will be laws about what oyu can post on you r pages about sex, drugs and other usually non public information, but how do we expect our kids to learn about these subjects if parents aren't willing to take time to exlain these topics.
<LI>ok
<LI>I want to experience what there is to offer but I can't access it I don't have any spacific addresses
<LI>It is the parents' responsibility - and theirs only - to raise their children and to instruct them about sex and the associated risks/resposibilites.  This is NOT, nor should it be, the role of Government!  The internet, at long last, provides the necessary catalyst to open the lines of communications between parents and their children about the subject of sex.  The loud, repressive, voices of the Radical Right does NOT represent the opinion of most Christians (we are Catholic) and indicates merely the
r own inadequacies when dealing with their own children on the subject of sex.
<LI>As is the case with almost everything in life, there are advantages and disadvantages to Sex on the Internet.  I see the Internet as a mega library.  All information (for and against specific social issues) should be available.  Explicit material not suitable for young eyes should be rated as such to inform parents of what this site contains and it is up to the parents to decide whether or not their child is old enough or mature enough to visit this site as is done at movie theatres.  We cannot stop, h
wever, those perverted parents from sexually abusing their children and using the Internet as a means to say "see, this is okay".  Only education (in school or otherwise) can stop these monsters from corrupting our youth, not the government, not censorship, not a "regulating body".
<LI>it is alright and it is exactly like TV was a long time ago with censorship it needs time thats all
<LI>Love it !
<LI>I don't think it be gov. regulated.
<LI>too much restrictions on sites in the US
<LI>child pornography in any form should not be on the net
<LI>People need to take responsibility for themselves and their progeny.We do NOT need more government interference in our lives.Where does censorship end? Ban sex and what's next, political ideas etc... If one's sensibilities are compromised by sex (or anything else for that matter) avoid it but one should not have the right to censor another.
<LI>Good for ADULTS but need to pay attention for the kids..
<LI>I think that Sex is a very wonderful thing and I enjoy it all the time.  I do not think that ANYONE should be disallowed the right to see or read what they would like over the Net.  However, I think that if you are under age (18 or younger) then you shoul
<LI>PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE. LIVE AND LET LIVE.
<LI>just a way to fell free
<LI>it is very realistic
<LI>I think it's an adults perogative whether he or she wants to interact sexually on the Net. What is not appropriate is for children to see graphic pornography on the Net.  If the new packages like Surfwatch, Net Nanny etc. can keep children away from sexually explicit sites than I don't think there's a problem with the existence of the material on the Net.  If these packages or others like them do not work, then unfortunately I believe that regulation is required.
<LI>It'll be here wether we or someone else tries to censor it.
<LI>Sex is good no matter where I get it.Except the anal
<LI>The government can't control crime. Or the speed limit! How do they expect to enforce arbitrary rules of morality?
<LI>Nobody is FORCED to use it!
<LI>no problem
<LI> If I can find it I like it
<LI>well...iwouldn't know because I really didn't found anything yet....
<LI>It's great.
<LI>It is too hard to find pictures of naked men!  Most of the pictures are of women.  I do not want censorship on the net.
<LI>The experience one gets out of the Internet depends a lot on the intellect which is attempting to use it.
<LI>more beastiality picts. HARDCORE!
<LI>Sex is great and the Internet too
<LI>I DON`T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT IT YET.
<LI>Just another form of communication and commerce.
<LI>Perhaps, the Internet allows interfacing of cultures and life styles which lead to understanding and tollerance!
<LI>It is very easy to find any kind of "sex" on the internet.  I personally do not agree with censorship, but do feel that someone (mainly guardians) should take some responsiblility in keeping children away from Sex on the Internet.
<LI>Some times pretty funny, some times too commercial, some times VERY stupid
<LI>good
<LI>excellent learning experinces
<LI>You should show the survey taker how they compare to others
<LI>Groovey
<LI>kewl
<LI>Good pass time that my wife and I enjoy
<LI>i think you should be able to see it if you want to
<LI>I'm fond of it.
<LI>it would be cool if someone on the net could blow me.
<LI>Not enough real stuff
<LI>it is a safe and confidential way to get info
<LI>Between consenting adults sex is fun and people shoud relate both socially and sexually
<LI>I think it is good, but the passwordes to places is bad.
<LI>Why the fuss? If a person wishes to view it let him. What harm does a little knowledge do?
<LI>its comes down to freedom of speach
<LI>Should NOT be restricted; Only exception -- the children stuff is OUT!
<LI>No answer
<LI>Well, from what I have seen over the past few years, I find that the Internet can be a great place to learn about sex.  Especially since many people on here, as well as easily obtained documented souces, can help ease talking about this subject.  As for pornography, it's far easier in real life to get it than it is on here, to be honest.
<LI>It rules.
<LI>Just because some parents are unable to keep their kids out of R movies "we" haven't closed them down.  Why should "we" limit access to sexual expliciate material just because parents can't supervisor their children. 
<LI>Right on Due!
<LI>I'll take it!
<LI>It sucks.
<LI>I can rent a video for a couple of bucks, and know what I'm getting.  The adventure of the net is cool, but the sexual satisfaction is crap.
<LI>should be excesible but controled for minors
<LI>I don't think it hould be banned.
<LI>Only just connected just laerning
<LI>I have not really looked for it but it seems to be abundant and caters for every level of perversion.
<LI>happy
<LI>Congress should not regulate internet.
<LI>Like any other type of material -- should be left up to the viewer to determine whether it is appropriate or inappropriate.
<LI>I think quite a lot of sex.  I also rather enjoy the Net (though not at all to the same degree).  As for putting the two together...   
<LI>It's safe and does bother anyone not looking for it
<LI>If humans can figure out a way to draw, carve, write, sculpt, or otherwise imply sex or sexual subjects in any medium, they will do so.  Any censoring is bound to be counterproductive and fruitless.  But, by the same token, humans have been seeking to censor sex and sexual subjects ever since those subjects were written, carved, sculpted, or implied.  This tit-for-tat cycle is a natural struggle that is destined to be repeated forever, with neither side gaining the advantage for very long.  Rather amus
ng, actually, and absolutely unstoppable.
<LI>a great way to explore the psychological aspects of sex
<LI>good idea but not in french
<LI>Good Stories, Something must be done about flaming and posting inmaterial stories.
<LI>hi ! MY NAME IS JIM G. I LIKE PORNOS, AND LITTLE CHILDREN  
<LI>i don't think that it should be regulated by the government. the government is given too much power over us already.
<LI>I think it is a benign pastime which cannot really hurt any adults.  After all we all have a choice of what we access.  I would consider it the ultimate "Safe Sex" the perfect "Zipless Fuck" as it were...
<LI>Great
<LI>it's ok
<LI>i think its fun and entertaining
<LI>Same as in the adult stores, or shops.  You gotta be 18 to enter.
<LI>ITS INTERSTING
<LI>wicked stuff!
<LI>Good, but should be less accessible to minors
<LI>I love it...
<LI>I feel that information on the Net should be freely exchanged.  The Users and parents of minors that use the Net should censor them from their end.  The 1st amendment MUST be defended!
<LI>I think they go together like bread and butter
<LI>I'm doing a senior thesis on the percieved need for ethical content regulation on the net.  Just passing through...
<LI>bad news!
<LI>The net just wouldnt be the same without it!!!ð
<LI>It really makes me feel good and horny. Feellike I could get up and fuck anything after a while.  Drives me crazy. Love it!!
<LI>Information should be available to those that want it...
<LI>good
<LI>I LIKE IT A LOT AND ITS ALL AROUND AND ON ME.
<LI>great
<LI>It's doesn't kill anybody.....
<LI>It is very new to me.  I think it is all an outlet for sexually deprived people. Or, those who access the internet for sexual gratification could be just a coward and afraid to approach a real person.
<LI>I find  it very stimulating and do not oppose it att all. I feel that sex on the net should be governed by each individual...if you don't want to b exposed to it stay away from it. I find the only way you end up seeing it is if you purposely look for it. In my opinion you can't accidently "bump" into it.
<LI>Senator Exon can go straight to hell.
<LI>I don't think that there is anything wrong with it.  After all I do belive it is called freedom of expresion
<LI>It is great!  I love the pictures of men and gay sex on "Men on the Net."
<LI>I think that the government should stay out of it.  I feel that if you don't want to see a "dirty picture" then don't look at it.
<LI>If I could find someone to talk with I would really enjoy it.
<LI>haven't seen enough to know
<LI>It is a poor substitute for the real thing.
<LI>Good clean fun !!!
<LI>JUST STARTING TO EXPLORE THIS
<LI>I AM JUST STARTING TO EXPLORE THIS 
<LI>I enjoy sex on the internet!
<LI>interesting
<LI>I think that anything between CONSENTING ADULTS is fine...i don't agree with any form of kiddie sex or anyone being forced to do something they do not want.
<LI>Educational; I see how I was dominated before I got divorced
<LI>sure why not!!!!!
<LI>WWW not much for sexual content, but you can dig up a lot in IRC if you try
<LI>I have enjoyed exploring erotica on the internet,  It is very interesting to find the great variety  of things that turn people on.  My fantasies are very prosaic
<LI>more, more, more
<LI>At my age it's no big big concern
<LI>love it
<LI>love it
<LI>Hard to find the right information
<LI>I like it!!!  Too bad I'm not smart enough to decode binaries.
<LI>It's great
<LI>One can encounter many aspects of life on the Net, sex is just another aspect of life.  I beleave that to attempt to take sex of the Net is similair to attempting to take it out of mags and other publishings.  You don't find it unless your looking for it so it's hard for me to understand how someone can be offended by it's existance on the Net--how did they encounter it?
<LI>threshhold first ammendment issue
<LI>I think parints/guardians should preview what a minor wants to see but adults should not be restricted.
<LI>It is really fun since it is difficult, if not impossible, to get this type of material in my home town!
<LI>real sex is better!
<LI>its great!!!!!
<LI>Easy to find.  Some of it's good, some bad, like with all media.
<LI>just started 
<LI>it uses a lot of bandwidth, but I enjoy it
<LI>It`s good, nurds can watch naked vomens
<LI>It all must be free and think by users themselves.
<LI>SHOULD BE LEFT TO EACH INDIVIDUALS LIKING
<LI>I don't have a problem with it as long as it's for adults only
<LI>the porn on the net really sucks. buying porn from a conveince store is much easier
<LI>Hands Off!!!  Use software to prevent access, if needed.
<LI>Almost every time I am on the internet,my pussy is wet!!!!
<LI>It's like going to a bar you can get it if you want to, and if you're under 18 - stay the fuck out!!!!!
<LI>I think it's great to have sexual content on-line
<LI>It is a voyueristic outlet and inlet and very time consuming and addictive (to Me)
<LI>wonderful
<LI>Sexual material on the internet is just that. It isn't real and shouldn't be regarded as such... If there is to be ANY regulation of the internet, it should start at home.
<LI>It is good
<LI>i would would like to see more than adds!
<LI>safe,should be able to block if needed by parents
<LI>It seems like it all about making money. Nothing is for fun.
<LI>good
<LI>i want more of it
<LI>Non-harmful if viewed with an open mind
<LI>This a good idea.  Thanks
<LI>More free pictures
<LI>EDUCATIONAL
<LI>The openess of the net has greatly improved my sexlife with my wife and helped open our relationship up in other ways as well
<LI>safe,good,pleasurable
<LI>It's a wonderful way to learn and experiment with new sexual experiences.  It should be for adults only, but NOT restricted from adults in ANY WAY!!!!
<LI>Sex is the primary human activity, the net is the new frontier.
<LI>I like it and I wish the government would but out.
<LI>I've had at least 15 blind dates with people from the internet.  I've had some *very* interesting encounters, erotic and romantic.  It's been fun.
<LI>It seems that the NET was one of the few places where information was truly free... It was wonderful. I'm angry and frustrated with attempts to censor. 
<LI>they both rule!
<LI>leave it alone the government should not have the power to 
<LI>it's the best thing that happein
<LI>I said that, sex in the net is ok. How about you, masturbator?
<LI>i think it is great. parents should be able to controle their own kids. i dont see how the american government can try to controle something that is WORLD WIDE if parrents dont know enough about the net then dont let your kids on the computer...and thats my oppinion
<LI>Great!
<LI>It is educational and exciting!
<LI>Boring
<LI>I think it's a great way for people to find out what they always wanted to know about sex!
<LI>I really want to do it 
<LI>I think it is a good Idea.
<LI>wish i could see more that my server denies
<LI>its ok
<LI>Adulte should be able to access any materials that they want to on the net.  Parents should be responsible for what their children have access to.
<LI>As any other subjects I think there should be a place for "Sex" on the Internet as well. People that want it should be able to find it. Children should be under their parents jurisdiction. Otherwise there are a lot more damaging effects from other aspects of human life, compared with Sex. After all Sex promotes life. Wars and other conflicts tend to extinguish it. The survey for all it's worth seems excellent. Congratulations !!
<LI>NOT TO EXPLICIT, JUST PICTURES, YOU CAN ONLY FIND IT IF YOU LOOK FOR IT.
<LI>i think that companies need to give parents the resources to censore or block off what the do not want there childeren to see.
<LI>A damn fine idea - just avoid dicks misleading others
<LI>IT IS SO EASY TO SEE PORNOGRAPHY
<LI>Too much filth and weird sex
<LI>No Answer
<LI>Benign source of pleasure but kids should be prevented from access.
<LI>Sex is out there.  I think that it should be openly talked about and I think that legal guardians should be in charge of what gets seen, not the government
<LI>I love it.
<LI>I THINK IT IS GREAT
<LI>I love sex, and I love the Internet.  The Internet should *not* be censored.  It is up to parents to monitor their own children. I don't need the government or anyone else to make my choices for me.  How *dare* they think they know what is ok for me to see!  What makes would-be censors think there judgement is any better than mine?  Those would would attempt to censor the Internet are busybodies who should mind their own business.  I razed two moral, intellegent children without busybodies moralizing. 
As adults they have the right to raise their own children without government or other busybodies telling them what they can see!
<LI>I haven't really looked that hard but I am grateful there is somewhere to get advice and information.
<LI>sex - the best thingyou can do
<LI>just do it
<LI>just do it
<LI>I want MORE....I want YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>it's addictive
<LI>I THINK IT IS A NEAT THING TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING AND THINKING ABOUT SEX.  WE CAN NEVER LET ANYONE STAND IN OUR WAY OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND PRESS.
<LI>interesting questions. well developed in form and content.
<LI>MAKE IT DIRTIER
<LI>I think sex is less dangerous than war, rape, hard crime etc. that is flooding the news and the net!!!
<LI>devine
<LI>Iiiiii Like It !!!!!
<LI>it's a good thing with it
<LI>GREAT
<LI>Nice place to visit, wouldn't want to live there!
<LI>I want to experience beastiality
<LI>Am just starting to become involved
<LI>I find that it has helped me discover other sexualities out there, and whether one can approve or disaprove of sex on the net, we all are apart of sexually driven society and its apart of everyone's lifestyle at almost any age "these days"
<LI>Parents should monitor their children's actions on the net.
<LI>It's saved me a lot of money on pornography.
<LI>I LOVE SEX!!!!  THE INTERNET RULES!!!!
<LI>i think it's the newest form of safe sex
<LI>Don't approve, but sexual, non-tittilating, conversation should be fine.
<LI>No special opinion to date
<LI>I like sex on the net, because I can see what I am never going to have up close and personal!!!
<LI>Sex on the Internet is fun for adults.  A great fantasy outlet.
<LI>Lets see some more!!!!!!!!
<LI>I don't know much.  I feel kids should be able to see a limited amount of exual information.
<LI>I think it is an excellent way for people to be honest with sexuality without having someone right there to judge them.
<LI>wonderfull
<LI>no big deal.
<LI>The Internet is merely a reflection of the wants of its users.
<LI>ENTERTAINING
<LI>not for me
<LI>Its a potential homewrecker...that's for sure!
<LI>the internet doesn't affect much in the sex department, It's just like buying a magazene.
<LI>It's fun, can't catch anything, get horny and go to the bedroom
<LI>Sex on the internet is cool for those who want to see it.  I believe that parents should show tighter control over the homeplace and censor pornography instead of waiting for someone else to take the responsibility!!!
<LI>I love sex and the Internet
<LI>sex on the net is great.  it has really done a lot for me.
<LI>you don't have more sex than any other institution
<LI>I like it very much!!!!!!!!
<LI>Too far and few between good sites ...
<LI>Its there and I'm not surprised
<LI>its cool
<LI>There is a few real pornography in internet, it is a pity
<LI>It can be healthy but, also harmful in some situations.
<LI>While it is very important for there to be the free exchange of ideas and information, efforts should be made to self-regulate (in the very least) the net, or a government will do so.
<LI>I want hardest sex in internet
<LI>very good!
<LI>it is great and very personal and cheap....no one know you are doing it!!
<LI>I think Sex is something that should be kept behind closed doors. NOT ON THE INTERNET!
<LI>it's pretty cool
<LI>Sex is what you make it...
<LI>I think it's great, just another form of people sharing ideas and stuff...If people like it why stop just because some people don't?
<LI>they are both part of daily living 
<LI>it can be an enhancement.....the problem is those who seek replacement of off line life.....
<LI>just do it!
<LI>Sex on the internet has become an issue which is completely blown out of proportion.
<LI>just do it!
<LI>I find it quite fulfilling.  It allows me to enjoy reading about a wide spectrum of sexual topics in the privacy of my home.
<LI>I think sex is a good idea. I think my idea of sex is a good idea for me. I don't think I have any right to tell anyone what to do, or how to do it. And, I think that, like what a child eats, what a child has access to on the net is up to the parents. It is not up to Internet to be a free babysitter.
<LI>If the Internet is going to be completely open, whatever one wants to supply should be able to be found on the Internet.
<LI>Very poor quality.  Easier to go to video store.
<LI>No Comment
<LI>The obligation of online providers is to develop a system whereby parents are "able" to selectively censor the net, without restricting other users.  AOL has made the first attempt at this, and I like it.
<LI>it's ruining my marriage
<LI>I love it
<LI>Sex is "GREAT !" and internet is like a drug
<LI>Using chat, it allows me to frankly ask other people about some of my fantasies, and to see if they have expeienced it.  If they have I can find out what is was like for them.
<LI>YES
<LI>interesting
<LI>Safe sex on the NET
<LI>Sex is fnatasy
<LI>I think that when i am on the internet I could be missing out on sex in the next room...
<LI>it is sick
<LI>i think that it should be available to those who are of legal age and wish to view it
<LI>I believe it is another forum to degrade the sanctity of something a lot more special than the NET.
<LI>Its frustrating to have to wait while it comes up
<LI>It should be accessed by all who want to see it.
<LI>It's good!!!
<LI>haven't seen any, but not because I haven't tried
<LI>I love sex & the internet is a get away like tv... just a little more interactive. 
<LI>GOOD INFORMATION RESOURCE
<LI>Some good information.
<LI>I would like to get information for contacts
<LI> I feel sex on the internet has done nothing and will do nothing to make a child or younger person have sex.  People have sex because they want to, not because a computer program told them to.  I feel sex is a great way to relieve stress and a great form of entertainment.  I wouldn't stop reading about it or doing it--even if I had to.
<LI>I think its great, but there needs to be more hardcore stuff
<LI>It's OK -  Fun!
<LI>I like it, it is a goood and safe way to read and see this material
<LI>I find that downloading a few erotic images makes a satisfying short break from work.
<LI>I think its Great
<LI>I think if parents think it's O.K., than we have no buisness making a law saying they can't.
<LI>its cool
<LI>well it does nothing for me
<LI>It's fine, and it's the parent's responsability to monitor their children. The net is a rescource and a tool for educating and informing ourselves. I've learned more over the net than I've learned from my parents or teachers. The only place I could say I learned more about sex than the net is with my partner.
<LI>Freedom of pictures, sex is great, censorship is ludicrous
<LI>no answer
<LI>I think it's ok just not for children.
<LI>I believe it is destroying marriages and encourages deception
<LI>I think it's fine that it's there, and I use it at times.  I do not think it should be regulated.  If parents don't want the children to see it, keep an eye on them.  If adults are offended by it, then tough shit. Deal with it.  No one is shoving it in their faces.
<LI>The net allows for communication of ideas at a rapid pace, some of these are sexual. It acts as an outlet for several types of pesonalities that are discouaraged in traditional cultures, if this prevents rape, incest and the like then it is good if not th
<LI>I think it's fine that it's there, and I use it at times.  I do not think it should be regulated.  If parents don't want the children to see it, keep an eye on them.  If adults are offended by it, then tough, deal with it.  No one is shoving it in their faces.
<LI>I don't see a great problem w it. 
<LI>I really use the Internet a lot, but I am not interested in Sex on the Net. I still prefer - and hopefully always will- the real thing.
<LI>GRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAATTTT!!!!!!!!
<LI>It's great!!!
<LI>i think it is great bcause it allows to explore different types of sexuality and ways to make your relationship better. anyone that is againsy sex on the net well fuck you and your mother.
<LI>Its inevidable. Attempting to stop it only strangles the rest of the net.
<LI>Entertaining, benign
<LI>I THINK ITS GREAT AND NOW I WANT TO HAVE MORE SEX WITH ANYONE 
<LI>could be better
<LI>Http://www.sec
<LI>Internet is the most useful and universal telecommunications tool our civilization has ever seen.  Also, sex is a natural part of our existence.  I feel Internet plays a splendid role in disrupting cultural taboos, as well as serving other vital communications functions.
<LI>It's mixed, good and bad
<LI>It's great!  Both of them...
<LI>A good idea
<LI>I think taht sex on the internet must be open for everyone. Ofcourse children must not seem real hardcore sex, but I don't want to be punished because some parents can't handle their children. I am old enough to speak for myself!!
<LI>Love it
<LI>i think its very informative, and a place to find a kindred spirt who shares the same tates in sex with out cencership
<LI>Sex is a part of our basic nature. But it is hidden and made perverse my old religious ideals. The internet has allowed our species to explore all aspects of sexuality and I believe will allow the impressionable to make a choice about sex. 
<LI>no opinion
<LI>if it is consenting adults viewing then i have no ptoblem with it
<LI>it is okay for me
<LI>unsure at this time.  
<LI>Im 22 years old and i think i can make my own choice.
<LI>Its a fun way for concenting adults to have safe sex
<LI>sex is great. its my life. the net is ok for gifs and such..
<LI>SEX ON THE INTERNET SUCKS
<LI>It is entertaining and quite erotic.  Good old fashion fun!!
<LI>Fun and lushess
<LI>it´s good
<LI>People need to concern themselves with real problems and not the symptoms.
<LI>What's wrong with sex?  Your mother had it didn't she?
<LI>Needs to be made more accessible!
<LI>I enjoy it's presence
<LI>it's hard to find free good sex pictures
<LI>9-14 yearold boys
<LI>for the people who put beautiful pictures of the huamn body i praise your art!  To those who pollute the 'net with your garbage pictures your perverted shits!!!!
<LI>sex is awesome and so is the internet. they go hand in hand.
<LI>I think the Internet provides an excellent outlet for sexual expression of all kinds.
<LI>they go hand in hand for some and thats fine, but i dont really get off on computer picts.
<LI>I think that sex on the internet is very abundent on the internet . And sometimes it does get rather annoying with every search item you select theree is something about sex brought up
<LI>could show more of my fetishes(up the skirt) Needs parental approval more for kids(over 16 and no access to anyone under 16)
<LI>I'm 20, and I think that most sites that limit access to 21 and older are violating my rights to "ADULT ENTERTAINMENT."
<LI>it is ok
<LI>It's nice to see there are others who share similar interests
<LI>I like it!
<LI>OK, freedom of speech, and freedom of press reign here.
<LI>It is good.  
<LI>I would like to tryt it.
<LI>OK over 18 years - old enough to die for our country!
<LI>its not bad...it promots safe sex
<LI>HI!!  Brent Young if you would like to chat call 1-405-373-4639 or write 924 Polk  Piedmont,OK.  I'd like to hear from anyone!!!
<LI>I THINK THAT PARENTS NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT THEIR CHILDREN SEE AND HAVE ACCESS TO.
<LI>Mostly lame and capitalistic, yet sometimes, hot
<LI>Sex is great, the internet is equally as great, put them together and it is iressistible.
<LI>Rock on!
<LI>another form of venting sexual frustration for adults
<LI>It's never too late to open your mind--adventure.
<LI>only one way of finding sexual material, but private
<LI>I find it is a great place to talk about taboo subjects.  IT's real educational.
<LI>The only thing unnatural about sex is the desire to hide it from society.
<LI>Verry Different
<LI>It's part of life and is therefore part of the Internet
<LI>I Love It!!!!! can't get enuff
<LI>Geared toward a teenage male geek mentality.  Real men don't need cybersex! 
<LI>Not Having any children, I feel I cannot judge sex on the net as negative.  I believe it seems to be all-male oriented sites which discourages me.  Don't we have enough material that glorifies a woman's body?  I would like to see some virile, young men!! 
<LI>I think it allwows some true informatin to be aired.
<LI>i think that it is here and that it isn't going anywhere.  parents need to control what their children are viewing/reading and that it the govt has no right to control what is avaliable.
<LI>LIKE TO SEE MORE OPEN
<LI>Pathetic.  Serious information/discussion is almost impossible to find compared to commercial pornography.
<LI>I'm new to the internet, but from what i see, i like.
<LI>Party on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>It is appealing but should probably be restricted.
<LI>I'm just discovering the internet and sex and can't wait to see where it leads.
<LI>I am a new user of the internet and am still just checking it out.
<LI>More realtime sites (chatting, videos etc)
<LI>I hear about kiddie porn being a problem but have yet to see any
<LI>I think it's great!!!
<LI>its great just have all net software thats new have a parental lock and have updates to upgrade old software. The net should be able to provide all leagal sex materials to people 21 and over freely
<LI>its whatever you want it to be.
<LI>I Like Sex
<LI>Works for me..... Other than that, I have Zero to say...
<LI>for any one of legal age..it's a fine thing
<LI>I think its great.  
<LI>more is better
<LI>It is not all to bad.  It really helps some people to explore there feeling with out being ashamed of it.  I guess that I am a Zoophile and now I am comfortable with the feeling.
<LI>It is clean fun.
<LI>it is no different than sex on TV (HBO, playboy channel, etc...)- let parents apply restrictions as the parent deems necessary. 
<LI>It is a basic catalogue for whatever you would like to see, purchase, or use. Beyond that it is up to the individual to find sexual interests. thanks
<LI>I think the government should worry more about themselves
<LI>i think it will be great
<LI>Not at all exciting.  I've not seen any graphics.
<LI>giving a child unsupervised net access is just as bad as giving them cigarettes and beer
<LI>it's pretty cool
<LI>sex on the internet should be open and regulated in the household
<LI>OK
<LI>It's great.
<LI>whats better than sex???the internet is a good outlet and a possible meeting place for people with the same ideas.
<LI>more free stuff!  It does have the potential to aid the community [cyberporn/sex] and hopefully this will be developed.
<LI>it's a curiosity thing
<LI>Sex, porno(all forms) and other fantasy material should not be censored. We all have a right to see, read and admit info that we like. no one should stop this!
<LI>on the net Iam able to explore areas of interest from the privacy of my home
<LI>too much time to find too little viewing
<LI>very interesting and informative
<LI>need more lesbian sites, too many dorky male sites.  
<LI>I enjoy it very much.  It's fascinating and entertaining.
<LI>it very hot, you can see a lot of thing
<LI>I am frustrated by not being able to find what I want - child pornography
<LI>Great educational/entertainment resource. Terrific for meeting new friends and potential partners.
<LI>it's ok... A rating system and electronic screening should be available with parental control
<LI>Fuck it
<LI>need more nude pictures to download 
<LI>Finding sex on the Internet is no more (and no less!) difficult than finding it a 7-11.  If you are looking for an adult magazine, the plastic wrap doesn't hide the fact that the material is available.  Just like attempting to censor the net will only result in a false "facade" offering little real security from sex, but perhaps a little emotional security for the prudish.   This box needs to be bigger so I can read all of my text at the same time!
<LI>Keep it on
<LI>Big whoop....who cares.  Nothing beats the real thing.
<LI>I like the pictures of naked and half-naked men.
<LI>It's okay!  We all have "certain inailiable rights" (1st ammendment) of the Constitution
<LI>ok
<LI>Lots of fun, a real eye opener!
<LI>it satisfies curiosity when u can find it
<LI>it's great. the more open, the better.
<LI>I think that there should be sex on the internet
<LI>I think that there is nothing wrong with it-- it can help people fulfill some of their fantasies to an extent, without risking contact with things like STD's...
<LI>I think it's great. This society (America) is too damn repressed for it's own good. The people complaining probably fantasize about worse than you can find on the net!          
<LI>Self Regulation and Guidelines Should prevail
<LI>It's a part of our life
<LI>I want some pictures of it.
<LI>Happy that it exists.
<LI>There is a place on the internet for anything. 
<LI>Make it "Hotter"!
<LI>I think that it is the best 
<LI>ALL KIND OF PROSTITUTION HAVE TO BE AVOIDED
<LI>I think it is a produkt of the society`s technological development and must be accepted. The future may come to show that this was just the beginning of "the era of free accsess to sexual fantasies for Everyone" tasiessess
<LI>It's fun!
<LI>I wonder why the government has taken it upon themselves to decide who is old, or mature enough to view sexual material.. I'm 15, but a lot more mature than some adults! Why is someone that's 21 more suited to see sexual material than a 15 or 16 year old?
<LI>easily acessed. largely perverse. needs more security. Currently kids can get in easily if they want to.
<LI>it can be better
<LI>not very exciting
<LI>Myself I enyoy it, but I am over 21 and I am very opened minded about sex. I am not ashamed of what I like to view.
<LI>i think its fine if you dont like it dont look
<LI>It's great and it definitely helped my marriage!
<LI>i wish there were more on line sex chat lines if any are out there
<LI>havent seen mutch yet
<LI>Personally, I believe that it is an uncontrollable source of immorality for adults and children alike.  It would be better if all- yes, all sexual content (meaning pornography) be kept behind coded "screens".  I find no problem with sex education, ect. but I strongly oppose pornography on the internet.
<LI>I'd love to find ways on the net to meet people in my area that enjoy sexual encounters, orgies, etc.
<LI>HARMLESS TO ADULTS, HARMFULL TO CONFUSED LONLEY KIDS
<LI>it is a new and very exciting area that I have found really fun and exciting and fun> no really I think it is harmless and I have enjoyed the freedom it allows people to explore bizarre fantaies with out anyoner getting hut.
<LI>I feel that it could help people meet potential partners.
<LI>Not an issue with me, but I believe that the net should stay uncontrolled. let the parents take an interest in their children. The net is not a baby sitter. 
<LI>I have no problem with it. If you want sex on the net...you should be able to get it.
<LI>it's easily accessed, but it should be like everything else.  Internet providers should have some sort of censorship tool for parents to use, but that wouldn't affect the rest of us mature, responsible adults.
<LI>it´s good becurse you learn a lot of it.
<LI>Fine with me, you do only what you really want to do with it. 
<LI>it's great fun
<LI>I'd like to explore more of it.
<LI>It's a free world, and people went to war to give us this freedom,so lets keep it.
<LI>lots of fun!
<LI>It's all a bit sad really
<LI>porno is as porno is
<LI>education not supression is a healthier attitude to sex
<LI>It's a good idea
<LI>OK
<LI>I think it is fine, but I have found forums where it is not appropriate - like on searches.  BUT - I do NOT want govmt to be involved, I think that we are responsible parents, too, so I encourage the children to sue the internet for school, but I usually help them.  I also feel that supervision is important, but your kids should know their boundaries anyway.  Besides, The hype about all of the porn on the Internet - in my day it was a big deal to look at Playboy and the like.  I remember boys talking a
out it - so - I guess we just need to teach our children what is appropriate and what isn't.  Besides - eventually they will see things - they are always curious.  As long as it is a look see type of thing - I don't agree with online sex chat- that takes it to a new level.  Although I don't feel that that should be regulated either!!!
<LI>it's really to access but really ininteresting
<LI>at my age to have a hard-on is a precious sign of vitality-and internet help
<LI>I Love It and Get Hard thinking about and horny when I see it.
<LI>In one word----FREEDOM.  The internet is owned by no one, so why is it nessecary to regulate it beyond recognition.  I'm of the opinion that if you don't want to see sex, don't look for it.  By chance if you bump into it, turn away or turn it off.  Be aware of what your children have access to and deal with it accordingly. 
<LI>it is very interesting and very easy to come across
<LI>i want to see more
<LI>Sex is very great.
<LI>I think what some people are calling porn is no more than a Fredricks of Hollywood ad. I have yet to see mush hard core porn on the Internet. Live chat rooms on AOL and other services are worse than the Internet search can find!
<LI>IT SHOULD BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO EVOLVE. PUBLIC WILL FORCE SELF-REGULATION.
<LI>There should be more.  There should be one home page for all subjects.
<LI>The internet does different things for different people... all depending on what that particular person wants from it.
<LI>I think its a great masturbating tool. some people are embarrassed to buy books etc. so with the net you can get anything anytime and jerk off 24 hours a day if you want.
<LI>it is important to allow freedom and permit people to express themselves as long as they are not hurting anybody. it is also a nice diversion. moral majority sucks but perverts too
<LI>It's the best thing that ever happned to sex!
<LI>I think the the Net should be no different than your average newsstand.  If you are too young, you should not be allowed to see sex stuff.  Anyone over 18 should have ABSOLUTELY no restrictions placed on them.  Give me Liberty or give me a 286.
<LI>I LOVE
<LI>I think it's fine for adults.
<LI>If you need it,you can get it. I am glad its there.
<LI>I do not engage in cybersex, but am interested in reading what people say in cybersex. What value they get out of it, is beyond me!  It does nothing for me!
<LI>interesting
<LI>I THINK IT'S GREAT!  IF MY WIFE DOESN'T WANT SEX I CAN JUST LOGON AND HAVE SAFE SEX WITHOUT CHEATING.  I ALSO LIKE SEEING THINGS I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN, BUT TOO SCARED OR JUST HAVEN'T TRIED YET.  I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN TV'S, BUT REALLY SCARED.
<LI>Sex is a beautiful thing and I see no problem with it being on the net
<LI>cut off the access to minors using the internet providers.
<LI>I don't think society is enhanced by it.  In fact I think society is damaged by it
<LI>it should be open to whom ever wants as long as their of age
<LI>Indifferent for the most part.
<LI>Cost too much!
<LI>where is it?
<LI>I want to see CD & VIdeo.Because I join from Japan.
<LI>I think it is hyped up too much. A lot of what is easily available is tame. There are too many companies seeking payment for access to sex related sites.
<LI>Good. Keep it up.
<LI>Eliminate all child porn & its disseminators from the net; children can easily be exploited and they should be protected. I work for a US gov't contract and have access to the gov't server: On this gov't server you can see ALL the sex images of women you 
<LI>poor
<LI>I think the sex in the internet is good.
<LI>I like it....it's a good way to masturbate!!!It's a real turn on.
<LI>great
<LI>Internet is probbly the biggest source of SEX
<LI>I love it!!  Haven't figured out SeeUSeeme yet though.
<LI>I think that it is one of the things that is driving the interest in the internet. Sensor the net and watch people find other avenues.
<LI>would like more area on incest
<LI>over rated & over hyped.
<LI>cool stuff for people looking for safe sex.....! 
<LI>Good
<LI>I think the Internet has to have all kind of stuff, (including sex)...
<LI>interesting
<LI>overrated or over 'reported' by hysterical Christians
<LI>It's nice, I like it.
<LI>exciting and I really enjoy it
<LI>i have no problems with sex on the internet, besides when children are involved, i think there must be no regulation to any subject. Let people listen, see and speak about there interest nomather what they are. Freedom and liberty for all.
<LI>I think that the internet is a refletion of today's society so sex on the net should be allowed. As for the "problem" of children being exposed to it through the net, it's up to the parents to instill good values. And besides, has anyone watched prime time tv lately ?!
<LI>Cybersex is great!
<LI>Ido not believe in censorship of any type.
<LI>a nescessary poll that ALL citizens need to answer truthfully if society is to understand the potential of the 'net
<LI>thank you for the opp'y to suggest the freedom is better than any censorship.
<LI>It's very different.  I'm a wirehead, so I love it.
<LI>hmmm
<LI>I have no problem with it.
<LI>I think that if parents responsibly montior their childrens' activities on the Net, instead of using it as a baby sitter, then the question of exposure becomes moot.
<LI>it is very stimulating and informative
<LI>Very Cool
<LI>Love it!
<LI>I see nothing wrong with cybersex. It seems totally harmless.
<LI>Regulations if and what they are going to be, they need to be enacted now so that service providers and others can act accordingly and sex can take the whatever place it is going to take on the internet and sites can become stable and accessible to those looking for them.
<LI>I think it's silliness.  It does nothing for anyone w/a brain.
<LI>Good
<LI>there should be less jpeg files or you should offer jpeg as a download
<LI>kool bananas
<LI>It's the best i've had in Years!
<LI>alot of potential, good as long as it is monitored by each individual as to what they are looking for. this should be a self regulated subject
<LI>Hard to find online action
<LI>It is fun and cost effective
<LI>no comment
<LI>It's all new to me. It's exciting.
<LI>i think its great, my wife and I have a lot of fun trying to find stuff on sex.
<LI>Insubstantial need relationship....
<LI>for me it may be ok
<LI>I LIKE IT
<LI>i like it
<LI>Sex is the best as for the internet I have not really explored it yet.
<LI>Highly overrated, no problem at all for responsible parents
<LI>cybersex is and always will be safe sex. anybody who worries about abstractions and not reality is clearly having problems themselves
<LI>Where there's a medium like I-net there's people exploring sex. There are sights being shut down because of all the visitors so there is a need for it. I men/women can find sex/partners overhere then they don't have to go out on the street to make that an unsafe area.
<LI>I just wish you could find pictures of men eating after-birth or some woman being fist-fucked up her ass.So far all I can find is pussy shit like fags and dikes sucking donkey dicks.
<LI>Sex is a part of life, however teaching children is what parents are for (or at least I thought so...). Better ask Uncle Bill.
<LI>interesting but only as a time filler not a replacement
<LI>No Comment
<LI>it is simpley great !!! keep on doing it !!!
<LI>i HAVE HAD A BLAST I MEET 2 LADIES ONLINE AND HAD GREAT SEX, 
<LI>The net is real life, and sex is a part of it, It's everywhere and I don't think that it matters. Especially in the USA the duiscussions are going on and on on this subject, but who has the guts to ban guns first...... 
<LI>Its great
<LI>Surprisingly commercialized my many, generally acceptable to few
<LI>I wish it was easier to talk about sex on the net. On line systems like AOL have excellent areas for pervertion!
<LI>good
<LI>It is a good place to get questions answered. 
<LI>I like it, Much better than having Tapes around the house.
<LI>It appears to be a business more than anything else
<LI>Right on!
<LI>it's great, it's the best thing to happen to me since my first sexual experience with my next door neighbour!
<LI>I think it could be sick sometimes,  but i doesn't bother me
<LI>It Rules
<LI>I think the government should stay out of this issue (and quite a few others). The marketplace will take care of itself.
<LI>It's great, I LOVE IT!  KEEP IT UP! :) <BG>
<LI>Pretty cool
<LI>very cool
<LI>it is good
<LI>There isn't anything wrong with sex and the internet provided that children can't access it easily. On the otherhand, there should be some kind of regulation that would protect young children from accessing sexually explicit materials and charge and put those adults into prisons for presenting these materials to children.
<LI>Dislike the `commercial' teasers!
<LI>I would like to see more sex photos on the net.
<LI>NO PROBLEM
<LI>More please
<LI>it doesn't matter what anyone thinks ,you can't force your own opion or morals on others ,even god give us a choice ( we have or own conscious and we are responsible for our choices) 
<LI>I think it's interesting and stimulating
<LI>interesting
<LI>the sex in the net is very good!!!
<LI>Mostly poorly done, with little content.
<LI>Pornography should be available for those who are of legal age and request it.
<LI>The experiences of sex that I have had were enjoyable and non-damaging
<LI>Its a whole new dimension to sexuality...
<LI>Unlike what ignorant people and media think, the Net doesn't revolve around sex.  Sex is only a small content of the Net.
<LI>I think it's the best thing that has happened to this country.
<LI>can not seem to find anything more than very soft porn and that is hard for me (a step above newbie) to find.
<LI>I think it's great that there's yet one more way that people can expand the range of the human sexual experience. I also think that matching on the net holds promise for the future as a way of bypassing all the bar and club BS. Perhaps if more children have unbridled access to sexual material on the net, there won't be so many ignorant teens out there getting themselves into unwanted pregnancy and STD situations. And perhaps more kids will be satisfied with masturbating to porn instead of losing their 
irginity so early and suffering other consequences of early sexuality.
<LI>It needs faster technology, more bandwidth, teleconferencing
<LI>I doesn't matter.
<LI>IF YOU LOOK FOR IT YOU WILL FIND IT!
<LI>I don't see a problem with it if children are monitored by thier parents. ( Who should be doing this anyway!)
<LI>always internet is an oportunity
<LI>it has not much value besides being a turn-on. There is little real information (at least as far as I know).
<LI>It is somewhat interesting to see what others think about sex.
<LI>Great - we should have more of it !
<LI>could be more
<LI>i want more free access
<LI>Sex is great and so is the Internet. Governments butt out!!. b\\\\elong 
<LI>Benign.  Give it it's place where one has to go specifically to find it, and let the rest of us, or at least spend the rest of ur time, getting on with our business.
<LI>Like most new forms of media, Sex was predominate at first then settled into its own natural level of censorship. The net will do the same.
<LI>i like it
<LI>tom
<LI>I WISH IT WAS NOT CENSORED OR DOSENT COST ANYTHING
<LI>it allows me to get satisfied safely
<LI>An appropriate freedom of speech where one must be allowed to pursue their interests free of government intervention.
<LI>Enjoy it a bit too much.
<LI>pretty wierd
<LI>The net is pure democratic anarchy. We all do as we choose. We all have a say. If you choose to look at porn, that's your choice. If you choose NOT to look at porn then avoid it like the plague. Regardless of where you are, cyberspace or "real life," ever
<LI>It does have it's place in the world. It's not going anywhere soon.
<LI>Sex on the Internet is a positive way to expand our culture.  Americans fetish of sex will increse with technology.
<LI>Im interesting
<LI>This is the first time, i dont know what i exactly think
<LI>interesting...very interesting
<LI>It great!
<LI>Satisfies sexual frustration to some point
<LI>It's fucking awesome!
<LI>There should be some kind of age verification, password, etc. I would like to see it easier to find for adults
<LI>Sex and the Internet are reality...So are books, movies, vcr's and I don't agree with censorship on any of those
<LI>Sex? I love it! The intermet? Love it!!!
<LI>I love sex and I like Internet
<LI>It`s relaxing!
<LI>In proper moderation and under moral, adult supervision, it is another form of experssion and entertainment that is private and harmless and maybe even informative
<LI>I love it but it can be addicting. I do not favor it at the expense of other uses of the internet.
<LI>Sex is great and the Internet helps us frustrated housewives.
<LI>good
<LI>Anything that makes it easier to get laid is COOL.
<LI>I find the stories are interesting, helps the sex life with my boyfriend in that I have a story in my head from the net.  Sex on the net is great because so many people are closed minded and some just have no idea about sex, I believe the net opens up a new spectrum of possiblities.
<LI>loveley
<LI>let we choose our own stuff. 
<LI>I'm 14 and found this with ease
<LI>it rules
<LI>Love It
<LI>great
<LI>should be possible
<LI>doesnt matter
<LI>children are not getting sex education in either home or schooschoo 
<LI>I think that while children should not have access to sexually explicit material, once a government or other body begins to limit what one can/can not have access to, many conservatives will try and limit what other groups have access to.  It will inevitably lead to a slippery slope.  Internet users should not tolerate such types of limitations.
<LI>I have found it invaluable for contact with other like minded people - all over the world makes it especially interesting
<LI>not poro
<LI>I love sex & the internet.
<LI>I like masturbating while I surf the net
<LI>It's fine as long as it's viewed by mature people.  Parents should regulate their children, not the government!
<LI>personally, I've only found a really lame SM manual.  That's it.  Of course I found that only after searching for material on cattle branding!!!  I don't look for it, and I haven't "stumbled" upon anything sexual.  I'm sure it's there if I wanted to find it.

<LI>The net has access to information on sexuality to pornographic pictures. Whatever infor mation you need to know about sex you can find it on the INTERNET.
<LI>Internet should educate us about our sex options.

<HR NOSHADE>

<H2><CENTER><I>How would you deal with the issue of regulating sexual/offensive content?</I></CENTER></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_SOL -->
<LI>Parental responsibility.  Everyone else should deal with it.
<LI>Let parents control their children
<LI>Electronic security software
<LI>Leave it be. It is a parents job to censor.
<LI>parents should decide it
<LI>self control / parental supervision
<LI>Close site access until users age is proven. (i.e. I'm not exactly sure how though, maybe when video phones become a reality then users could identify themselves in person?)
<LI>should be less accessable to children
<LI>Parents controll access
<LI>parental supervision
<LI>LET PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY WANT AS LONG AS IT IS LEGAL!!!
<LI>using passwords that have been applied for through mail
<LI>Same rules on the Net as in real life
<LI>parental control only
<LI>It should be up to the person or parent NOT Gov't
<LI>be regulated by home based share/software
<LI>parental responsibility
<LI>If you don't like it don't look.  Also parents should regulate what their children see, as they do for movies and tv
<LI>Parents should watch their kids
<LI>let censorship remain only in the home
<LI>how about a "V-CHIP" for computers, like t.v.?
<LI>The net should be completely open -- parents should monitor their children if they're concerned about what they might see.
<LI>parents are the ones concerned let them deal with it!
<LI>tt
<LI>morality standards are by nature the morality of the group, not the individual. repression is the most profound result when the group's ideals are placed above the individual's.  
<LI>add html tags rating sex/violence content of net
<LI>software lockouts ,similar to my cable box
<LI>Let business grow that sell filters for sexual explicit materials

<LI>It should be up to the parents to control!
<LI>Ban children from the net
<LI>have a password to get into the sex lines on internet I would like to know some addresses but have not found any to get into this.
<LI>Rating system plus parental control.  Keeping children ignorant of sex and sexuality only serves as a problem, not a solution.  Children will experiment with or without government regulation and censorship.  While I believe that we should not keep this information from them entirely, I also feel that some children are not ready to be educated in some matters regarding sex, which is why a rating system is preferable over censorship and why parents should be allowed to block access to those sites rated "
ot suitable" for children of certain ages.
<LI>let parents restrict what kids see
<LI>parental obligation to censor their younger children
<LI>Install the equivelent to the V-chip in computers.
<LI>Ratings that only apply to sexuality w/violence

<LI>if u dont like it dont look at it
<LI>let the ISP or user decide
<LI>Brent Young;call me 405-373-3746
<LI>You cannot impose censorship on a system which spans different countries with different moral codes of conduct.
