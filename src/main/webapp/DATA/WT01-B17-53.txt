We already know about potatoes whose &quot;eyes&quot; have sprouted. These potatoes,
we've been warned, contain dangerous-even lethal compounds. The food industry has
come up with a solution: a sprout inhibitor, namely isopropyl
N-(3-Chlorophenyl)-carbamate, referred to as CIPC.


<P>     According to researchers at Cornell University, CIPC may contribute yet another
toxin on the dinner plate. CIPC is now used on 90 to 95 percent of stored potatoes. 
It not only helps to avoid sprouting, but also prevents shrinkage, blackening, and
susceptibility to bruising. Does that sound like something you want to consume? 
After treatment, the skin of the potato retains twenty times more of the toxic
residue than the pulp.

<P>     <B>Editor's note:</B> <I>One conclusion is to avoid the commercial potato skins sold at
fast food places. But should you peel the potatoes you cook at home? Potatoes are an
extremely nourishing food, provided they are eaten with the skin! It appears that
the answer to the dilemma is to seek organic potatoes. Keep in mind that if enough
people ask for a particular product, the vendors will eventually comply.</I>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>BUTCHER BLOCK FOR
BLOCKING BACTERIA</CENTER></H3>


        <P>Surprise!  Innocent-looking plastic boards for cutting foods in your kitchen
make comfortable homes for bacteria, unlike wooden cutting boards or butcher blocks. 
It seems there is a natural bactericide in wood that is protective, totally lacking
in the plastics.  Once again, we demonstrate that natural is better.


        <P>According to studies done at the University of Wisconsin, pathogens thrive on
plastic but disappear on wood.  Salmonella, listeria, and E coli did not survive
within three minutes of application on a wooden board.  This was not the case with
the plastic boards.  Even cleaning the plastic boards with hot water and soap did not
get rid of the bacteria, yet wiping the surface of wood proved to be sufficient.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>BROCCOLI:  BENEFICIAL AND
DELICIOUS</CENTER></H3>


        <P>Broccoli harbors what could be the most powerful anticancer compound ever
detected.  It's a versatile vegetable, delicious raw or cooked, as a dipper, in
salads or stir-fries, or simply steamed with a squeeze of lemon Juice.  It's thick
with beta-carotene, vitamin C, calcium, and potassium.


        <P>Frozen broccoli contains more beta-carotene than fresh.  Well, not
exactly-frozen broccoli is usually packaged with more of the florets, the tender buds
of the plant.  The stalks have less beta-carotene than the florets.  When you prepare
fresh broccoli, a portion contains both the stems and the florets.  When you prepare
frozen broccoli, the serving is comprised of the florets only.


<P>The darker the buds, the more nutritive value.

SUPERFOOD</CENTER></H3>


        <P>Should every meal contain chlorella and wheat grass extracts?  Perhaps barley
grass or oat grass extracts, too?  Alfalfa sprouts?  Should you also be serving
adaptogenic herbs like Siberian ginseng, astragalus, suma, and licorice?  What about
ginkgo biloba, green tea, and milk thistle?  After all, each of these substances
offers a slightly different benefit that sets it apart from the others.


        <P>Add a few antioxidants, maybe spinach powder, carotenes in addition to the
beta, some bifidobacteria, and even apple pectin, and there wouldn't be much room for
the plates or main course on the dinner table, let alone dessert.


        <P>Not to worry.  Green Radiance, a concentrated green superfood, provides all of
these unusual ingredients in a refreshing, healthy-tasting drink.

STOMACH TUMORS</CENTER></H3>


        <P>Researchers were able to isolate several compounds from soy sauce that inhibit
tumors induced in test animals.  Even very low levels were effective in reducing the
number of tumors by 66 percent.  The researchers are attempting to use the isolated
constituents as antitumor drugs.

        <P>Editor's note: Soy sauce is made from wheat, soybeans, water, and sea salt, but
tamari is made only from soybeans, water, and sea salt.

        <P>Grilled or fried meat and fish contain various mutagenic substances.  Among
these, ten have been examined for long-term carcinogenicity, all proving to be
positive.  Broil or bake your meat and fish.
