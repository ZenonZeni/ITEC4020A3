<p><font size="3">AN ENTERPRISING TURK.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">HE TRAVELS MANY MILES TO FIND HIS OCCUPATION
GONE.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The long-prevalent impression that the people
of the United States rank first among the nations in the spirit
of enterprise must be modified in the light of the
recently-discovered fact that the &quot;unspeakable Turk&quot;
has unsuspected stores of the article bottled up under his tanned
and inexpressive countenance. The fact was revealed by the
journey of a Turk all the way from Smyrna to this city to set up
the business of adulterating opium.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Immediately on his arrival he called on a
member of the firm of McKesson &amp; Robbins and proposed to
start the business on the co-operative plan, he to furnish the
experience and McKesson &amp; Robbins the capital. It must have
been a severe shock to his Oriental habits of thought when he was
politely informed that he was in the wrong house for that kind of
business. But he was not dismayed, and fortune was more than
kind. After further search he fell in with a relative, who had
preceded him to this country, and by the latter's help operations
were immediately begun. The drug was materially increased in
volume, but correspondingly reduced in strength, by the addition
of liberal quantities of fig paste, colored with a decoction of
yellow berries. The product of this new industry was placed upon
the market at a very moderate price by a commission house outside
of the drug trade, but in communication with the retail branch of
it through the furnishing of kindred articles.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When the adulterated drug began to attract
attention, which it quickly did, little difficulty was
encountered in tracing the manufacture to its source, and
although there was no law under which the offenders could be made
to discontinue business or be punished, yet a very effectual
remedy was found in exposure. This was employed with so much
success that after a few months the adulterated article was
practically unsalable, the new industry was paralyzed, and the
gentleman from Smyrna retired in disgust to his native town. The
collapse of this international venture insures to the people of
this country the continued use of pure opium, as the precautions
of the United States Government effectually prevent the
importation of the adulterated article. It is said by authorities
on the drug that the adulteration of opium cannot be detected
except by analysis, and that special skill is required even in
analyzing it.</font></p>
