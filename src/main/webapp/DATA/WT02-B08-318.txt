TOPEX/POSEIDON surveys sea-level heights by measuring the time required 
for pulses generated by the onboard radar altimeters to bounce back to 
the satellite from the sea surface. This indicates the distance, or 
range, between the sea and the satellite. Free electrons in Earth's 
ionosphere can delay the return of the radar pulses to the satellite, 
this interfering with the accuracy of sea-level measurements. To correct 
for this delay, the satellite's National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) altimeter makes measurements in two channels: Ku-
band (13.6 GHz) and C-band (5.3 GHz). Because the ionospheric range delay 
is a function of radar frequency, the difference between the two 
measurements provides both a measure of the integrated electron content 
and a correction for the range delay. This is the first dual-frequency 
altimeter to measure the ionospheric range correction directly, providing 
the first global, high-resolution view of the ionospheric electron 
content. The integrated electron content varies with local time - the 
maximum level occurs during the day and the minimum level during the 
night.<P>

This image shows the daytime integrated electron content of the 
ionosphere between October 22 and November 1, 1992. Magenta regions
contain less than 8 x 10^16 electrons per square meter (a range 
correction of 1.7 centimeter or less), while white areas contain in 
excess of 74 x 10^16 electrons per square meter (a range correction of 
16.1 centimeters or more). The range correction can reach values greater 
than 30 centimeters.<P>
The image shows two prominent aspects of the ionosphere - the "equatorial 
anomaly" and the influence of Earth's magnetic field. The equatorial 
anomaly refers to the fact that the maximum electron concentration is not 
at the equator but at about 15 degrees north and south. It is also clear 
that the band of maximum ionospheric effect is not parallel to the 
geographic equator. Instead, it slants from north to south across the 
Pacific Ocean following the geomagnetic equator and reaches its 
southernmost point in the "South Atlantic Anomaly" region just east of 
South America.

<H3>The TOPEX/POSEIDON Global Ocean-Monitoring Mission </H3><P>
</CENTER>
A joint effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) and the French space agency (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales - 
CNES) to study Earth's oceans, the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission will observe 
the global ocean circulation for three to five years. The oceans play a
fundamental role in maintaining the current habitable climate on Earth by 
transporting an enormous amount of heat through their large-scale 
circulation systems. Understanding the dynamics of ocean circulation and 
the role this circulation plays in climate change is the main goal of the 
TOPEX/POSEIDON mission. TOPEX/POSEIDON will measure sea levels; map 
basin-wide variations in currents, and monitor the effects of currents, 
such as the Gulf Stream, on global climate change. Additionally, the 
mission's measurements will allow scientists to study ocean tides and 
waves, marine geophysics and wind.<P>
The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite travels in a 66-degree inclined orbit around 
Earth at an altitude of 1,366 kilometers. This orbit allows coverage of
95 percent of the ice-free oceans every 10 days. The satellite's position
is known to within 10 centimeters from Earth's center, an unprecedented
accuracy that will enable the satellite's radar altimeters to make
precise measurements in sea heights. TOPEX/POSEIDON carries six sensors:
NASA supplied the dual-frequency altimeter, the laser retroreflector
array, the TOPEX microwave radiometer and the experimental Global
Positioning System (GPS) demonstration receiver; CNES supplies the
single-frequency, solid-state altimeter and the DORIS (Determination of
Orbit Radiopositioning Integrated from Satellite) dual-Doppler tracking
system receiver.
