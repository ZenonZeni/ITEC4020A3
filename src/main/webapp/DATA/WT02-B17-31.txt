<h2>SOLICITATION GOALS</h2>
<p>
The overall goal of the solicitation is to assist industry in the 
development and validation of integrated hydrogen energy systems and 
enabling technologies.  The objective of the feasibility study being 
requested by this solicitation is to either: (1) enable the applicants 
and DOE to evaluate the potential for near-term implementation of 
hydrogen technologies (i.e., near-term hydrogen energy systems or other 
'niche' markets), or (2) to evaluate the potential for long-term 
development of integrated hydrogen energy systems in anticipation of 
future DOE/applicant joint ventures to commercialize the systems or 
technologies.  In either case, all awardees will be required to 
participate in a Phase I effort prior to consideration by DOE for awardee 
participation in later phases.  The anticipated progression of projects 
awarded under this solicitation will be:<p>
<b>Phase I- Hydrogen Feasibility Studies (to be awarded under this 
solicitation);<br>
Phase II- Technology Development;<br>
Phase III- Technology Validation;<br>
Phase IV- Demonstration of Scale-Up.</b><br>
<p>
This solicitation requests detailed applications for the Phase I 
Feasibility Studies.  DOE will award Cooperative Agreements for Phase I 
based on evaluation criteria and other factors as described in the 
following sections of this solicitation.  After the conclusion of the 
Phase I efforts by all awardees, DOE will evaluate the Phase I Technical 
Progress Report and future plans of each awardee based upon technical, 
economic, and programmatic considerations.  DOE may select awardees to 
participate in follow-on agreements based upon these evaluations.  The 
applications submitted to DOE in
response to this solicitation should provide detailed information 
regarding Phase I efforts, but should also include a sufficient 
description of anticipated efforts in follow-on Phases II through IV to 
provide an overall characterization of necessary steps to allow 
commercialization of the hydrogen technology/system at the conclusion of 
Phase IV.  The results of Phase I will provide the detailed description 
of proposed efforts in Phases II through IV which will allow DOE to 
select awardees for
these follow-on phases.
