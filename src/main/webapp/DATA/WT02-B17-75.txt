<H2>Select DSM Programs in the European Union</H2>

<P><B>Denmark:</B>
Denmark's DSM programmes are currently beginning implementation. The
primary programme delivery agents and funding sources are the utility
and the government. The most common DSM technologies and measures, in
rank order, are 1) lighting, 2) district heating, 3) appliance
efficiency, and 4) energy audits (industrial and commercial). The most
common types of DSM programmes in Denmark are 1) information &
education, 2) audit, 3) tax & penalty, 4) rebate, and 5) demonstration,
targeted toward a) industrial, b) commercial, c) residential, and d)
agricultural customers.</P>

<P><B>France:</B> France's DSM programmes
are well integrated into the system. The primary programme delivery
agents and funding sources are the utility and the government. The most
common DSM technologies and measures are lighting, district  heating,
appliance efficiency, building design, and motors. The most common types
of DSM programmes in France are information & education, audits targeted
towards residential customers, as well as commercial and public sector
programmes.</P>

<P><B>Spain:</B> The status of Spain's DSM programmes
is currently under consideration. The most common DSM technologies and
measures are water heating, space heating, and load control. The most
common DSM "strategies" in Spain are timeofday tariffs and
interruptable supply contracts, targeted toward residential, industrial,
commercial, and agricultural customers.</P>

<P><B>Netherlands:</B> In
the Netherlands no goals are formulated with respect to DSM programmes.
Most goals are formulated with respect to energy savings or CO2
reduction. DSM programmes are promoted by the government (NOVEM), and
the key participants are primarily utilities. Energy savings and C02
reduction are the major positive forces affecting the development of DSM
programmes in the Netherlands. SEP in combination with one distribution
company, EDON, have concluded a first project on IRP. The greatest issue
facing the Netherlands' DSM programme is the recognition of energy
savings programmes as a DSM activity and incorporating them, in a
coordinated way, into the organisation of the distribution companies.
Some of the Netherlands' DSM programmes are beginning implementation and
some are in the planning phase. Its primary programme delivery agents
and funding sources are the government and the utility. The most common
DSM technologies and measures are lighting, high-efficiency boilers,
better house-keeping, residential insulation, and the enlargement of the
CHPs role in generating electricity and heat. The most common types of
DSM programmes are lighting, district heating, and general improvement,
targeted toward residential, commercial, industrial, and utility
customers.</P>

<P><B>United Kingdom:</B> With so many things going on
in the gas and electric sectors, DSM programmes have been a low priority
for utilities in the United Kingdom and there is no change as a result
of privatisation. The new United Kingdom private electric utility
companies are expected to use DSM as a competitive benefit.  Load
control is being practiced while other DSM measures are in trials only
at this time. The primary programme delivery agents for the United
Kingdom are, in rank order, 1) the utility and 2) private entities. The
primary programme funding source is the utility. The most common DSM
technologies and measures are, in rank order, 1) lighting, 2)
weatherisation, 3) building design, 4) motors, 5) appliance control, and
6) appliance efficiency. The most common types of DSM programmes are 1)
audit, 2) shared savings, and 3) demonstration, targeted oward 1)
industrial and 2) commercial customers. Residential customers have toad
control of storage heaters. An estimated 1.5 billion pounds is
considered the Necessary expenditure for DSM programmes to meet their
C02 targets.</P>

<P>Programs are also in place in <B>Germany, Italy,
Sweden,</B> and <B>Finland,</B> as well as in <B>Austria, Norway,</B>
and <B>Switzerland</B>.</P>
