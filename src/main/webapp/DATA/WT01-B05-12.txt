<H3>NEWS RELEASE<br>
FOR RELEASE: May 20, 1995--CONTACT: Jack Groh (401)732-1551</H3>
                               
<H3>NATIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHAMPIONSHIP AT STAKE:<br>
DOZENS OF TEAMS COMPETING IN FIVE-STATE ROAD RALLY</H3>

WATERBURY, Conn. - The cream of the electric vehicle crop is racing through
the Northeast United States during the weeklong American Tour de Sol. The
race begins Monday May 22 in Waterbury, Connecticut. The winning vehicles
will cross the finish line in Portland, Maine five days later. This year's
race features entries from major automakers (Ford), a celebrity race team
(headed by actor Dennis Weaver), top student teams and entries from as far
away as Japan and Germany.<P>

        The American Tour de Sol ends on Memorial Day weekend and provides an
interesting contrast to the Indy 500 race run on the same weekend. "At the
same time Indy cars are roaring to victory in the national spotlight," says
Nancy Hazard of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, "these electric
cars are quietly revolutionizing auto technology. They can help ease the
United States trade deficit by cutting oil imports and create jobs here at
home. At the same time, they keep the country cleaner and can cut the cost of
treating air pollution-related illness. This isn't some starry-eyed dream -
the technology is available today!"<P>

        One of the key goals of the American Tour de Sol is to show that these 
new vehicle technologies are viable. "A major concern about electric cars has
been their driving range," says Hazard, "but after more than ten thousand
miles of daily commuter use in Vermont, the state's electric vehicle project
has yet to log one complaint tied to vehicle range." Over the six-year
history of the American Tour de Sol, range records have been consistently set
and broken. In last year's event, a Ford Ecostar traveled 189 miles and a
Solectria Force traveled 214 miles, both without recharging. Both of these
companies have electric vehicles available on the market.<P>

        Nearly fifty vehicles will run through two days of testing in Waterbury
prior to the race start. Along the route, there will be nearly a dozen local
stops where the race cars will be displayed to the public. Once the race ends
in Portland, another day is set aside for displays and exhibits. Vehicles
competing this year include solar-powered racers, practical commuter
vehicles, production cars already on the market, hybrid vehicles which use
electric motors in combination with an auxiliary generator, and special
vehicles such as buses, motorcycles and scooters.<P>

        Speed, range and efficiency are all factored into the scoring system.
Vehicles that travel the farthest and use the least electricity per mile have
the advantage. In fact, one of the many prizes offered is called the "NESEA
Energy Challenge." This prize is given to the vehicle that uses the least
amount of energy to drive the entire 300 mile course.<P>

        Daily updates including photos, background articles, in-depth profiles 
of individual teams and entries, and even soundbites from race officials are
available, starting May 17, on the World Wide Web. The ATdS Home Page is
provided by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado. The
internet address is <http://nesea.nrel.gov><P>

        Major sponsors of the 1995 American Tour de Sol include the United 
States Department of Energy, the Waterbury (Connecticut) Region Visitor and
Convention Bureau, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, the
Federal Highway Administration, the Maine Solar Blast and the Discovery
Channel.<P>


        The American Tour de Sol is organized by the Northeast Sustainable 
Energy Association (NESEA), the nation's leading regional association involved in promoting awareness, understanding and development of non-polluting,
renewable energy technologies. Headquartered in Greenfield, Massachusetts,
NESEA is celebrating its 20th year of working successfully in the fields of
transportation, building construction and energy.<P>
