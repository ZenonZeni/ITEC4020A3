<H1>Higher temperatures in Antarctica have led to disintegration of some ice
shelves </H1>

<P>One of the important unknowns in global warming science is how the
Antarctic ice sheet, which covers a land area as large as the continental
U.S.  and Mexico combined, would respond to a much warmer world.  This ice
cap, with an average thickness of 2,500 meters, would raise the sea level by
74 meters if it were to melt completely.  </P>

<P>Antarctica drew notice this year when National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric
Administration satellite images captured part of the pack ice disintegrating
on the Antarctic Peninsula (which extends outward toward the southern tip of
South America).  Between Jan.  14 and Feb.  27, an ice shelf that formerly
blocked the Prince Gustav Channel between James Ross Island and the peninsula
broke up.  </P>

<P>During the same period, the northern section of the Larsen Ice Shelf also
disintegrated, leaving a plume of debris extending 200 km east.  In addition,
a Rhode Island-sized chunk of ice broke off the Larsen Ice Shelf farther
south.  This iceberg, although large, was a fairly small component of what
has happened overall recently in Antarctica, says David G.  Vaughan,
glaciologist at the British Antarctic Survey, Cambridge, England.  Other ice
shelves around the Antarctic Peninsula are also in retreat.  </P>

<P>Over the whole of Antarctica, temperatures have increased an average of
about 1 &deg;C in 50 years, Vaughan says.  But on the Antarctic Peninsula,
temperatures have risen an average 2.5 &deg;C since record keeping began
there in the 1950s.  This change could be a local manifestation of global
warming, Vaughan says, or "it's possible it has nothing to do with global
warming."  In any event, these warmer temperatures have probably caused the
disintegration of the ice shelves around the peninsula, he explains.  </P>

<P>Scientists would also like to know whether the entire Antarctic ice sheet
melted during the Pliocene Epoch, 3 million to 4 million years ago, when
global temperatures were higher than they are today.  Determining the degree
of melting that occurred then would give some indication about how much of
the Antarctic ice sheet would melt if global warming proceeds unabated,
because without curbs on greenhouse gas emissions global warming is expected
to eventually produce a Pliocene-like climate.  </P>

<P>However, scientists don't even know whether the Antarctic ice sheet is
getting thicker or thinner overall, Vaughan says.  "We're completely in the
dark.  We really have no idea what goes into the ice sheet or what comes
out."  It is not known how much snow falls, what remains, what sublimes, what
is blown away, or how much ice is lost through calving of icebergs from the
ice shelves.  It is known that a lot of ice is lost from the undersides of
the ice shelves (which extend over seawater), but that is not being well
measured yet, nor are the smaller icebergs leaving the ice shelves being
counted in a comprehensive way.  However, satellite altimetry data now being
collected should indicate whether the ice sheet is getting thicker or
thinner, Vaughan says.
