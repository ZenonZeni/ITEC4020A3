Televisa, Azteca vie for viewers and ads as Mexican cable services take root

Playing host to a horde of new cable and satellite services carving out
their piece of the Latin American pie, Mexico's 12.5 million TV homes are
enjoying the fruits of competition.

TV already accounts for roughly 65% of total ad expenditure in Mexico, and
with a TV ad market forecast to grow by 15% in 1994 to $2.3 billion P as
large as Spain's P there would appear to be enough room to support the two
networks' ambitions as well as the new satellite arrivals.

Three months into its re-launch, Mexico's commercial network newcomer TV
Azteca is doing its best to give the reigning commercial giant Televisa a
run for its money.

Having secured the ailing state-owned TV network for $640 million last
summer, chairman Ricardo Salinas Pliego is out to put TV Azteca's national
networks 7 and 13 on the map.

Settling into its role as spoiler, Azteca recently re-jigged its program
lineup with a mix of U.S. imports and popular soaps. Azteca currently
produces 70% of its own material.

While Televisa commands 80% of Mexican audiences, Azteca's first major
challenge will be to attack Televisa's advertising dominance. Long
attacked for monopolistic practices, Televisa has for years attracted
major advertisers with its Plan Amigo. A variation on the
four-for-the-price-of-one French Plan, which necessitates buying a year's
worth of ads the pervious fall, Plan Amigo offers bonuses in exchange for
ad exclusivity. Televisa is under investigation by Mexico's Federal
Commission for Competition. Televisa reportedly stopped the Plan Amigo
last fall, but its agreements with major advertisers are guarded secrets.

Company boss Ricardo Salinas maintains that advertisers with TV Azteca are
reaching more people for their money. Comparing the revamped network's top
soap Marielena with Televisa's concurrent nightly newscast, 24 Horas, an
independent source showed a cost per rating point of $590 versus $1200
under Televisa's discount scheme. Launched a month ago, Marielena has
achieved a rating of 10.3% in Mexico City, compared with 16.2% for 24
Horas. Top Azteca shows thus offer 40 to 62% savings to advertisers.

Last November, Televisa subsequently pushed back the popular news show by
half an hour to 22:30. Tacitly admitting Marielena's success, Televisa
reasoned that at 22:00, viewers of the flagship Channel 2 would be less
likely to change to a Telemundo-produced soap if the popular half-hour
soap, Corazon Salvaje (formerly at 21:30) was still to come on Channel 2.

Azteca's other late evening soap, El Penon del Amaranto is not faring as
well. Early ratings after Azteca's October re-launch showed only 3.3% of
Mexico City homes watching P less than half the audience of Marielena
(8.1) and less than 10% of the rating of rival Televisa's 21:00 Valentina
(36.5). One of Azteca's top draws last year was La Cosa which airs Sunday
(22:00), attracting 13.8% of Mexico City homes, based on November figures,
compared with only 7.3% for Televisa's music show Noche de Valores on
Channel 2. And it's not just a battle among the terrestrial networks.
Conceding a lack of mass-appeal local product, an army of library-driven
channels rely on both premium and free-to-air American fare to lure
viewing in the 12.8% of homes with cable.

Against popular local shows on the terrestrial networks, the new satellite
service, Fox Latin America, is slotting its prime feature film fare as
well as drama series L.A. Law at 22:00. The satellite channel's top titles
in December included Home Alone, Come See the Paradise and Working Trash.

The new cable programmers concede that the Latin countries are very much
"developing" ones, and that subscription fees that will initially comprise
the bulk of revenues will be low. Fox, Tele-Uno and a slew of other
budding cable channels will increasingly compete for ad revenues to
support their admittedly risky ventures. Yet the pan-Latin American
advertising market remains relatively untested.

"Four years ago there were virtually no dedicated Mexican cable services;
today you can count 35 Spanish language channels available to cable
franchises...it's very competitive," says Ernesto Vargas, vice president
of MSO Multichannel and a partner in pan-Latin channels Tele-Uno and Cine
Canal. Vargas hopes to introduce a new, dedicated Mexican programming
channel by 1995. Tele-Uno, the 24-hour U.S. series channel which draws on
the big Worldvision catalog, is distributed via satellite throughout Latin
America, along with other entertainment newcomers, TNT Latin America, Cine
Canal, Gems TV, HBO Ole, and Cine Latino, which this month extends its
native Spanish service to the rest of Central America.

"Mexican product is clearly the most popular, the dominance of
[Televisa-owned] Channel 2 is proof of this," says Vargas. "Nevertheless,
Tele-Uno provides a good option. American comedy doesn't travel that well:
it's action and suspense that plays best after local shows," he says.
Vargas says Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place and The Heights are the
channel's most successful shows. According to Worldvision VP Bert Cohen,
such shows create an audience awareness which may cross over to its
back-catalog classic series.

Counterprogramming is key for the niche channels. "Multivision looks at
what we have in our catalog and tells us how to use it effectively," says
Cohen. r

Asian TV markets should continue to boom this year with China, Taiwan and

Asian TV markets should continue to boom this year with China, Taiwan and
South Korea ahead, according to Zenith Media's latest forecast. In dollar
terms, Europe will see the biggest increases with Germany keeping up its
rapid post-deregulatory pace while Italy and the UK return to the robust
growth rates of the 1980s. France will continue to muddle through, despite
continued economic recession, while Spain remains European TV's sick man,
thanks to the price war waged by the major channels. Ad sales house IP
predicts that Italy should experience a severe advertising recession,
dropping 2% at current prices.

RTL-5 struggles to secure up-market niche

Dutch fledgling commercial station RTL-5 has denied that  its schedule
revamp this month, increasing prime time documentary output, is a direct
result of its failure to attract the more affluent, higher educated
viewer, although its audience is youthful, as originally planned.

Bert van der Veer, program manager for RTL-5 and RTL-4 said the current
programming schedule evolved out of a need to get the station up and
running quickly.

"We realized even before we started broadcasting with RTL-5 that there
were programs in the schedule that should be replaced as soon as possible.
We are trying to deliver an alternative and we will try to devote more
time to that aim. Don't forget, it took the UK's Channel 4 ten years to
get it right." Other innovations include an increase in news output with a
30-minute bulletin at 20:00 and sports news at 22:00.

RTL-5 has not yet reached its 10% share target. Thanks to an exceptional
football match on October 13 (which got a 31.8 rating), the channel's
share peaked during its second week at 11.8% and decrease to and
stabilized at just under 6% since (see chart).

Overall RTL-5's programming strategy looks like a half-success: though
RTL-5 has cannibalized its sister station RTL-4, the two CLT services now
take a higher combined share than the latter did alone previously. Apart
from RTL-4, the three public state channels of NOS and the cable stations
have seen a marginal erosion of their shares by RTL-5.

The mother of all quotas?

The French parliament has decided that the education channel to launch by
the end of 1994 should carry 100% French material. Although this may
contradict European treaties, it is debatable whether French producers
have enough quality programs in stock to supply the channel. For instance,
in France itself the general opinion is that the best available TV French
language courses are those of the BBC.

UK kids like TNT-Cartoon Network.

In cable and satellite homes, for the week ending November 28, the Turner
twin stations took a 5.7% share among children aged 4 to 13, ahead of The
Children's Channel (2.6%).

Nickelodeon, which was introduced at the same time as TNT-Cartoon last
September, has been slower to break through, claiming with a meager 1.5%
share. The fact that TNT-Cartoon is free-to-air rather than part of the
Sky pay package, has clearly helped its cause.

In Spain, Tele 5's mix of game shows, action films and variety programs

In Spain, Tele 5's mix of game shows, action films and variety programs
has been derided as "tele-basura" or television garbage byJthe critics,
but Tele 5's lowest common denominator approach has nonetheless produced
healthy ratings. Now industry insiders areJsaying that Antena 3's recent
surge in the ratings may force the stationJto re-think its strategy.

In October, Antena 3 once again bumped Tele 5 out of the number two spot.
The revamped Antena 3 invested millions in contracting big stars and
produced a number of its own situation comedies that have been huge hits
in Spain and Latin America.

Tele 5 is still feuding with Sofres, Spain's audienceJmeasuring service,
and refuses to acknowledge Sofres reports putting Antena 3 ahead, despite
an independent audit confirming Sofres' data.

A spokesman for Tele5 says there are noJmajor programming changes planned.
Drastic changes could be premature as AntenaJ3 growth has come primarily
at the expense of TVE 1 and Spain's other public stations, while Tele 5
audience share has held steady at around 21%.

But industry insiders say that Tele 5 may haveJto re-group if Antena 3
continues its surge. Following Antena 3's lead, Tele 5 will have five new
series in production during the coming year.

Italian animation rises

Thanks to data supplied by Carat, RAP produces a series of indices on
European advertising. For each of five markets, the index refers to gross
TV revenue in the latest month available compared to a year earlier. The
RAP composite index estimates European TV ad revenue during the last
twelve months compared to 1992. Together, the five countries represent
over 75% of the total European market. Spain is excluded because high
discount levels make monthly expenditure estimates unreliable.

Italy airs well over 2,000 hours of animated programming a year, but local
producers are only responsible for a fraction of the output. Children's
programming, and animation in particular, has increased steadily over the
last five years, though the domestic production sector does not look to
share in the spoils.

Speaking at a recent conference of Italian animation producers, Alfio
Bastiancich, secretary of the Associazione Italiana Film di Animazione said
Italian producers account for only 3% of animated broadcasts on the public and
commercial channels.

Still blessed with "favored growing market" status among program

Still blessed with "favored growing market" status among program
prospectors, the Asia-Pacific region promises double digit growth in TV
advertising in 1994.

Aggregate TV ad spend across the 14-country region only accounted for .85%
of GDP in 1992 (.23% in China), but 1993 witnessed a 10.6% increase in
overall advertising. With per capita GDPs on the rise, and an increasing
number of channel choices, the region is hungry for product as
opportunities for barter syndication grow. Politics permitting, China may
be on the fastest growth of all, with 9% GDP growth forecast for 1994 and
1993 TV ad expenditure of $662 million, expanding by 45% in 1994.

New laws for Spanish ads

The Spanish government's adoption of the EU "Television Without Frontiers"
legislation has sent Spain's television stations scrambling to discuss
future ad rates now that advertising will be reduced.

After the Spanish government agreed to mandate a minimum of 20 minutes
between commercial breaks, senior Spanish TV officials held a preliminary
meeting to establish new rates with less discounting. Even though rates
will likely go up, many ad agencies are pleased as currently commercials
get lost in frequent, lengthy breaks.

Holland's daytime debut

Dutch public television this month begins broadcasting a daily Dutch soap.
Top Dutch independent producer, JE Entertainment, will produce On The Road
To Tomorrow -- based on U.S. soap Ryan's Hope -- for the ailing public
network Nederland 2.

The soap will mark an unprecedented collaboration between Veronica, TROS
and EO, the three broadcasters sharing airtime on Nederland 2. They will
amend their schedules so the show can be aired horizontally.

The soap will be shown ahead of satellite station RTL-4's ratings-winner
Goede Tijden Slechte Tijder. The soap is one of RTL-4's most successful
shows with ratings of up to 18%.

EU directive:  A blessing in disguise?

While French producers enjoyed their moment in the world political and
economic spotlight last month, it turns out part of their fortress was
more a Trojan Horse.

The main target of U.S. negotiators at the GATT talks on the TV front was
the EU's 1989 "Television Without Frontiers" directive which requires that
European originated programming comprise the majority of broadcasters'
schedules. But in fact the finer print of the directive may harbor a
silver lining for U.S. distributors and new channels.

To back its ban of TNT-Cartoon Network on cable last September, the French
government claimed it was only acting to uphold the directive. But,
according to an undisclosed legal opinion last summer by the European
Commission, it seems Brussels takes a radically different view of the
underlying issue. The paper, obtained by French broadcast researcher
Jean-Pierre Jezequel, is the text of the EC ruling banning TF1 from
creating a split of its service aimed at Belgian audiences. In an article
to appear in the monthly Angle Droit, Jezequel points out that the ruling
supports all the claims of Turner against the French government.
Specifically, the Commission's interpretation of European law says:

The directive forbids "all controls on broadcast services coming from
another member-state, a fortiori any kind of licensing requirements;"
however, the French have been insisting that each channel seeking
distribution in France get a CSA 'convention.'

If a broadcast service respects the regulation of its country of origin,
it need not be re-licensed elsewhere.

Furthermore, to clarify the directive, the Commission cites article 59 of
the Treaty of Rome (about the free flow of services through the EU), which
grants no special 'cultural' status to television.

If Turner decided to sue the French government and the CSA, it would have
its view supported by Brussels, concludes Mr. Jezequel. The only legal
avenue left for the French to stop Turner would be to sue the UK in the
European Court to force it to apply the directive. But here the law must
give way to politics. Thus the directive, widely criticized by U.S. rights
owners, could be a strong help to U.S. channels trying to penetrate the
European market. The 50% quota is restricted by the mention "when
practicable" and does not even apply to a whole range of programming such
as news, music and sports. Provided they find a host state, one could
argue that the new channels have a legal protection against other foreign
governments in Europe stronger than anywhere else in the world. r

Have shows, will travel

Cheap and cheerful game show formats continue to draw high marks across
multiple markets. Having conquered the margins of European TV schedules,
U.S. formats adapt to new territories.

Quota-resilient and economically sound, the ever-ready game show is
enjoying a renaissance on the world's airwaves. But beyond the fanfare,
glitz and prize money lurks a solid market vehicle: game shows are cheap
to produce, draw solid early evening viewing shares and can be readily
adapted to almost any culture.

Abiding by the programmers axiom that 'local plays best,' game show
formats have carved an enviable place in international TV trade. Game show
vendors are confident that their shows are the only geographically
transparent TV formats. TV bargain hunters learned early-on the value of
unlimited supply, long runs and audience loyalty. Game shows also offer an
ideal platform for sponsorship and barter.

Most frequently "co-produced" or rather "adapted," game shows are unique
among U.S. derived product in that they are rarely exported in their
original form. Beyond their ability to secure the daytime or traditional
housewife viewer, game shows' true value lies in its local adaptability.

For young, cash-strapped networks, game shows are a stalwart of the
schedule, both mornings, late afternoons and sometimes even prime time. As
much as 10% of some schedules are devoted to some form of audience
participation quiz shows and glamor games.

In the U.S., familiar game shows have been around for two generations and
remain popular. The new syndicated 30-minute version of The Price is
Right, a show originally launched three decades ago, proving that the
format is is one of TV's enduring classics. When those shows were
introduced to European audiences in the wake of 1980s TV deregulation,
pundits said such crass commercial exports could never repeat their home
grown successes and that their novel popularity would fade.

But they proved wrong. As in the U.S., game shows have established
themselves as Europe's most constant genre. In Spain, Italy, France and
Germany the Wheel of Fortune, Price is Right and Pyramid are now solid
rating busters for the dominant channels, scheduled mostly in late morning
or early evening slots.

But not just any game will play. The formula may seem simple to produce,
but getting the chemistry right is not easy, which is largely why U.S.
formats dominate long running games (5-7 episodes per week). Fremantle
International has foreign production subsidiaries in the UK, Spain,
Canada, Portugal, Greece, Australia, and Turkey and controls over 50% of
global game show distribution.

Owned 80% by The Interpublic group, Fremantle also is well-positioned to
exploit cash plus barter arrangements with international product groups
and clients such as Unilever. Thanks to barter, Fremantle has launched no
fewer than nine shows in fast-deregulating Turkey during the last two
years. Similar approaches are on tap for central and eastern European
markets.

"Nobody can re-invent the wheel," says Fremantle president and CEO Paul
Talbot who maintains that the basic types of games were invented in the
1950s in the United States. This view is shared by Michael and Roger King
of syndicator King World, which distributes only two game shows, Jeopardy
and The Wheel of Fortune, and admitted recently that they have looked in
vain for similarly strong product. King World has sold its two shows in
all major markets, often with Fremantle as a producer, since Talbot has
secured production rights for both shows across western Europe. Fremantle
International has 64 game shows running in 17 countries.

Europe's commercial networks tend to stick with proven formats, but
producers are anxious to develop their own shows. According to a program
database compiled by French consultancy INA, most shows are adaptations.
But European networks do experiment with new game concepts often based on
board games, but few survive more than a season, and almost none manages
to sell across borders. One of the few examples of a successful long
running home grown show is Des Chiffres et des Lettres, a word and
mathematics game broadcast on France 2 since the 1970s, and now
reformatted with some success by Channel 4 in the UK, VTM in Belgium and
La2 in Spain. According to France 2, the show has even recently aroused
some interest from U.S. buyers. Game shows could easily find themselves at
the forefront of new interactive TV capabilities. With Twentieth Century
Fox's upcoming multi-million dollar adventure game format Scavengers, the
game show will meet "techno-reality" drama. With a set in London,
Scavengers' European co-production partners will shoot their own versions
out of the same production facility. European producers have more success
with 'near game show' formats. These "entertainment" shows usually run on
a weekly basis, and are a mix of music, dance or even sports contests.
Such quasi-game shows are the way of the future and are a distinctly
European modification of the genre. One of the few successful purveyors of
European produced game show formats, French producer Jacques Antoine has
created 'adventure game shows,' expensive 90-minute monthly programs which
often feature sports contests in exotic places. Among his most recent
products, Fort Boyard has penetrated Scandinavia, where the show is
modified to local tastes although it is actually shot in France. But
Antoine has yet to come up with a five-days-a-week competitor to the U.S.
shows.

The economics of game shows are simple. The price broadcasters pay for a
show in the major markets depends largely on its potential audience; thus,
a show for an access slot is more expensive than one for daytime. In
France, industry sources reveal that TF1 used to pay up to $26,000 per
episode for its access shows (which it moved in 1992 to daytime) and pays
now up to $22,000. Shows on rival France 2 aired at lunch time are
estimated at up to $20,000.

Broadcasters' revenue for the same shows can vary considerably. Wheel of
Fortune, on TF1 at 11:50 a.m., carries a single break from which it
grosses about $60,000, on top of the show's two sponsorship contributions
(estimated at $20,000). The Price is Right can gross over $200,000 per
day. In Germany, according to data supplied by the advertising agency
Saatchi & Saatchi, in 1992 the Wheel of Fortune on average grossed
$600,000 per episode, in part due to its 19:20 time slot.

Game shows offer considerable financing and scheduling flexibility. In
Spain, where TV ad regulations are lax, there are few curbs on product
placement or sponsorship. Contestants' desks can be huge soap boxes with
the brand name displayed continuously, something unthinkable elsewhere in
Europe. Program duration can also be changed. Due to popularity with
advertisers, The Price is Right on Canale 5 in Italy, which started as a
half-hour program, was extended to one hour and even to two hours, before
settling back to one hour.

France Television has been running 90-minute prime time specials of its
two Grundy shows, Everybody's Equal and Going For Gold, which regularly
top the ratings of their respective channels, France 2 and 3. The latest
special on France 3 lifted the channel's share to 24%, above its average
of 15%. Fremantle typically acts as domestic producer of its shows
operating through a local production subsidiary. Last year the company
opened a game "factory" near Cologne in Germany and has subsidiaries in
seven other countries outside the U.S. Where there is no local corporate
affiliate, Fremantle acts as co-producer with a broadcaster or local
production company and takes up 40-70% of the profits, according to
outside estimates.

Most recently, Fremantle has extended its Latin American operations,
concluding a co-production deal with Brazil's TV Bandeirantes for
Supermarket Sweep and $25,000 Pyramid. Fremantle also inked deals for
local versions of Let's Make a Deal and Swap Meet, with Ecuador's
Ecuavisa. The only places where shows are sold in their original format
are very small markets. Grundy, the only would-be global rival to
Fremantle, is the producer of all its shows, though sometimes with a local
partner.

Paul Guilbert, who oversees foreign licensees' production of King World
distributed shows, insists on close control over such local versions.
Typically, major deviations from the guidelines only occur after
considerable argument with the original producers/distributors.

Despite the dominance of Fremantle and King World formats circulating in most
major markets, there remains considerable room for growth. The emerging
syndication market and new cable services are hungry for product.

Game shows are not suitable for every channel. "Second tier"
entertainment-led stations such as M6 in France and Pro 7 in Germany and
RTL 5 in Holland have avoided game shows, counterprogramming late
afternoon time slots to garner the valuable young adult or urban
demographic, often with U.S. series and sit-coms. But other relatively
small stations do carry game shows, like Sky One in the UK. In France,
TMC, a national cable and satellite service, has just introduced an
original format, Vitamime, produced by Canal+'s Ellipse.

Some mainline European networks are reluctant to overload their schedules
with "down market" stripped game shows. ITV scheduling executive David
Brenan, points out that, apart from the channel's traditional weekday game
show at 9.30 a.m., his quiz shows tend to appear once a week and to get
renewed regularly. "We look for new ideas all the time," says Brenan,
"usually, foreign formats would be proposed to the network through
independent UK producers."r

U.S. stripped formats dominate

In Germany, the vast majority of game shows are on the two leading private
stations RTL and SAT1 (although the number one, Dating Game, is on public
channel ARD) and all the daily shows within the top ten are produced by
Fremantle's German subsidiary. Strassenflirt is more of an entertainment
show than a quiz show. 5 Mal 5 is an adaptation from a Dutch word game
developed by IDTV and public broadcaster Vara where male and female teams
face each other. Few games, but prime time slots

The UK's ITV strips only one game show, Fremantle's Supermarket Sweep, in
mid morning, a traditional game show slot in which the ITV frequently
rotates game titles. This is one reason why The Price is Right (which was
doing well) and Wheel of Fortune (which did not do well) have been dropped
by ITV after a few seasons. The Channel 4 and BBC game shows tend to
emphasize knowledge contests, such as in Countdown, a France 2 format, or
Going for Gold from Grundy.

The game-variety cocktail

Italians have a penchant for long shows mixing interviews, music and game
sequences, of which Il Grande Gioco is a perfect example This genre can
easily be used either in access or in prime time. Canale 5, part of the
Fininvest group, devotes the highest proportion of its schedule to game
shows in Europe, behind Spain's Tele 5 (also part of the Fininvest group).
Canale 5 also strips most of its game shows, while public Rai channels
tend to carry weekly shows, the exception being Venti e Venti on Raidue
where viewers play a word game through the phone.

NewsrapI Viva, the first German music channel, launched on Christmas eve

NewsrapI Viva, the first German music channel, launched on Christmas eve
in 18 million homes. On top of the expected diet of pop music videos (50%
of them domestic), Viva carries reports on the environment, education,
sports and leisure activities, plus music news. Some regional regulatory
bodies have expressed concerns over the possible use of the channel by its
shareholders, four major music publishers, as a promotion tool.

The channel faces a tough battle in a market where MTV Europe is already
active. To increase its ad sales in Germany, MTV has launched a new
satellite feed allowing commercials in German to be fed to its 12 million
cable homes there.

Prices paid by the French channels for feature films can vary widely.
According to a report in Ecran Total, a French trade weekly, the rights to
La Soupe aux choux for different periods were bought for FFr1.5 million by
La Cinq, FFr180,000 by France 2, and FFr1 million by M6. The top prices
were paid by TF1 at Ffr8 million for hits such as L'Ours or Indiana Jones.
Canal+, as a pay service, can spend 50% more for top rated films.

Germany's RTL Television has ordered a third series of 230 episodes of
Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten (Bad Times, Good Times) from Grundy/Ufa TV
Productions. The soap is an adaptation of a format originally developed in
Australia as The Restless Years ten years ago, and first introduced in
Europe as a Dutch series for RTL-4. In Germany, the afternoon soap
recorded its best rating ever with 7.3 (5 million viewers) on October 18.

AsiaNet, the 20-year old American Asian programming service, is launching
a UK cable version. It competes head on with existing UK services
Asiavision and Namaste.

Loft, Argentina's Canal 13's new talk and variety show, has generated
higher press coverage than ratings. All 17 episodes were shot expensively
in Miami to get an original feel that would suit the eccentric host, Nico
Repetto, but Canal 13 was expecting Loft would get more than the 800,000
viewers it averaged last fall.

TV says ad clutter is not a problem. According to research sponsored by
the British network, the presence of program trailers in advertising
breaks has no significant consequence on viewing behavior for terrestrial
channels. Moreover, viewers seem to appreciate them. However, when they go
over five minutes, viewers tend to switch channels. Researchers also found
that viewers are twice as likely to zap away during end credits than
during trailers. As a result ITV is to ask producers to reduce credits.

No second advertising break will be allowed during fiction programs, under
the French broadcasting bill introduced last month. This hurts M6 which
relies heavily on TV movies in prime time.

Blazing its own trail in Asia, Grundy International Distribution recently
concluded its first program deal in China, selling police drama series
Bellamy to regional broadcaster Shanghai TV (STV). Grundy earlier
completed a multi million dollar deal with Hong Kong's Star TV for the
popular Australian soap, Neighbours.

launch pad

Paradise Beach the half hour teenage series was moved to prime time for
the Australian summer season on its home channel, Nine Network.
Distributed by New World International, the show launched on TRT in Turkey
in December and should be introduced in Germany by RTL in March, taking to
14 the number of countries where it is broadcast.

Grundy Worldwide and Telepictures Production (a Time Warner subsidiary)
are to produce for BBC1 a British version of the U.S. factual
entertainment series How'd They Do That, broadcast on CBS in 1993. The
show should be scheduled this winter.

TF1 introduced on December 20 Les Filles (The Girls) at 18.30, moving the
successful Helene et les Garcons to 18.00, while Premiers Baisers is
suspended, but should return later on. These daily sitcoms, plus Le Miel
et les Abeilles (weekly) are produced by AB Productions, the biggest
program supplier to TF1 with an average of 15.5 hours per week.

Canale5 premiered in December the second series of Dona d'onore (Birds of
Violence), a Berlusconi-Tribune Entertainement-Beta title. The first
episode had 6.0 million viewers and a 22.7% share.

Gaumont Television's Highlander series has been doing fairly well on TF1
and Italia Uno since introduced last fall. In France, on Wednesdays at
13.30, the show's rating for December 8 was 13.4 with a 44% share. In
Italy, Highlander was on Sunday evenings at 20.40 and raised Italia Uno's
share in the slot from 10% to 13%. On the U.S. syndication market
Highlander averages a 4.2 rating.

SeaQuest DSV is to launch on RTL on January 19. The pilot did well on ITV
on October 16 with a 15.4 rating, the highest viewing figure in the UK for
a U.S. series during the month.

Fiction programming continues to make inroads onto European prime time. It

Fiction programming continues to make inroads onto European prime time. It
is no surprise that domestic shows take top ratings. In import-wary
France, TV movie L'instit, allowed France 2 to beat its close rival TF1
for the month's top show.

Feature films occupy the upper echelons of U.S. rankings, and are by far
the most important U.S. genre in prime time in Europe. U.S. series are
typically scheduled before or after viewing peaks, except on the second
tier commercial stations like Pro7, M6 or Channel 4, which do not generate
high enough ratings to figure in those top tens.

In Germany ZDF 's Wetten Das...?, a mix of debates and contests, maintains
its position as the country's top rated show in October. A French
adaptation failed on TF1 last winter, but the format could still be
considered for other territories.

In Sydney (Australians ratings are only available on a market-by-market
basis) U.S. sitcom Home Improvement is having a strong run on the Seven
Network. Created by the same team that produced Roseanne and The Cosby
Show, two of the top rated U.S. series worldwide, it could expect an
equally strong international run.

In the UK, Coronation Street has been topping the ratings for years and it
is one of the main assets of its producer, Granada Television. In revenue
and audience share, Germany remains the most fluid market. RTL 2 has
confirmed its success against all the other "small" cable channels it is
competing with. The big loser is VOX which announced budget cuts and
redundancies in December.

On October 13 soccer matches took place around Europe for qualification to
the 1994 World Cup. The games made it into the top 10s in each European
market, but the qualifying round is now over and interest will be lower
until the finals next summer.

Channel 4: UK maverick re-writes program rules

Channel 4 occupies a unique position among Europe's and even the world's
commercial channels. By law, a "self-governing statutory corporation,"
Channel 4 programs an eclectic variety of both high-brow documentaries and
innovative drama, which are largely financed by the ratings success of
unabashedly commercial U.S. imports.

The channel has carved a niche for itself in the UK, and is confident that
its programming mix will be resilient in a fast-expanding, competitive
multichannel marketplace.

Albeit a mandated "minority broadcaster" -- it must devote its airtime to
alternative programming, a range of artistic, political or otherwise
"challenging" formats and genres -- Channel 4's annual revenues are 100%
commercial. With annual ad revenue of #306 million ($456 million, 1993
estimates) Britain's fourth terrestrial service is a strong magnet for the
upmarket viewer who would otherwise be tuned to ad-free BBC2.

Far from letting its quasi-governmental status keep its programming
strategy rooted in didactic fare, Channel 4, a primary patron of the
independent production sector, has taken the offensive, and come away with
sizable gains in numerous time periods.

On January 1 Channel 4 celebrated its first year unleashed from its foster
parents, the ITV network. The ten year old channel now sells its own ad
time and buys its own programming separate from the ITV network center:
the result is a clear ratings and advertising success.

"Basically, the audience we get with American programs allows us to
develop innovative, non-mainstream shows," says Caroline Thomson, head of
corporate affairs at Channel 4.

The channel actually airs the largest percentage of U.S. material on UK
terrestrial TV. Much of it is cult, such as off-beat theatrical films, as
well as the higher end of available U.S. drama and comedy, including NYPD
Blue, which makes its winter schedule debut and is intended to bolster
Channel 4's admittedly weak Saturday evening.

Last fall, Channel 4 scored its highest marks with the domestic soap
"Brookside," delivering a total of 6.16 million viewers (w/e Nov 28) for
its highest rated episode (each of the three episodes is screened twice a
week).

Overall, Channel 4 ran 2,037 hours of acquired programs in 1992, 48% of
which were first run. Although non-feature U.S. shows accounted for only
41% of total airtime devoted to acquisitions, their cost represented 52%
of the #14.5 million spent. On top of this figure, #8.9 million was spent
on acquired feature films (the channel also produces about ten films of
its own every year).

Although acquisitions represented 45% of the 1992 schedule, they accounted
for only 12% of the total programming expenses of #200 million. Resisting
pressure to go downmarket for the maximum share, Channel 4 remains
faithful to its remit. There is a safety net, however: a sophisticated
arrangement set up by the 1990 Broadcasting Act requires cross-subsidies
with ITV if Channel 4's share of ad revenue falls or rises too much.

Provided the channel maintains an audience share at or over 9%, its
current program orientation won't likely be questioned. Thanks to the rise
in the station's market share and an overall acceleration in UK TV
advertising expenditure growth (see page 1), Channel 4 saw a handsome
windfall in revenues which grew by an estimated 22% in 1993 to #306
million. After a drop to #184 million in 1993, the program budget should
be back to its 1992 level of #200 million in 1994.

According to Thomson, this should allow a little breathing space for
production budgets, which had been squeezed by the recession. U.S. shows
should remain relatively inexpensive, as competition with the BBC and ITV
is marginal. "A U.S. series cannot keep its slot on ITV with six million
viewers, while it's a hit on Channel 4 with four million," Thomson says.

The growth of satellite service Sky One has somewhat inflated prices, but
the two channels rarely go head-to-head in programming. Sky mainstays such
as Star Trek and Beverly Hills 90210 would not be suitable for Channel 4
according to Thomson.

Perhaps Channel 4's greatest coup has been the huge success of its
renegade, youth-oriented morning show, The Big Breakfast. Introduced in
October 1992, the show has drawn large chunks of audience away from
struggling GMTV, the new ITV morning licensee. In September 1992, Channel
4's 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. audience share was 4%, in November 1993 it had jumped
to 30% while ITV's had slipped from 53% to 43%. In the younger age groups
the show has even a bigger lead. Alone, The Big Breakfast is responsible
for 20% of the channel's ad sales. The fast-paced, irreverent show is
indicative of Channel 4's role as innovator in the UK marketplace.
