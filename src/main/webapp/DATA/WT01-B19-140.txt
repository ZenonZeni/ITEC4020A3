RE:        American Voters' Opinions on the Use and Legalization of  
           Marijuana for Medical Purposes 
___________________________________________________________________________ 
 
     In January 1995, the American Civil Liberties Union embarked on study 
of the voting public's views about marijuana policy.  The ACLU hired Belden 
& Russonello (B&R), a Washington, D.C.-based research and polling firm, and 
Doug Gould, a communications strategies consultant, to conduct the study. 
 
     In brief, B&R conducted four pre-survey focus groups in Dayton, Ohio 
(2) on February 16, 1995, and in Baltimore, Maryland (2) on February 28, 
1995.  The focus groups were followed by a national random digit dial 
survey by telephone, from March 31 through April 5,l995, among 1,001 
registered voters.  The sample was designed to represent all households in 
the nation, and the margin of sampling error for a sample of 1,001 is plus 
or minus 3.1 percentage points. 
 
     The findings that emerged from this work clearly demonstrate that a 
very substantial majority of the voting public supports a change in 
marijuana policy with respect to its medical uses.  The key findings were 
as follows: 
 
<b>1. Legalization of marijuana for medical use is favored by a clear 
majority of American voters.</b> 
 
     A very substantial majority of respondents (93%) has heard that 
     marijuana had medical uses.  Twenty-two percent know someone who 
     has used marijuana for medicinal reasons.  A series of questions  
     were posed to test the public's views on legalizing marijuana for  
     medical purposes: 
 
Q. Do you think it would be a good                VERY GOOD.............47% 
idea or a bad idea to legalize marijuana          SOMEWHAT GOOD..........32 
to relieve pain and for other medical             SOMEWHAT BAD............4 
uses if prescribed by a doctor?                   VERY BAD...............12

<hr><pre>Q. Thinking about medical uses of marijuana,       STRONGLY FAVOR....64% 
would you favor or oppose making marijuana         SOMEWHAT...........21 
legally available for medical uses where it        SOMEWHAT OPPOSE.....4 
has been proven effective for treating a           STRONGLY OPPOSE.....9 
problem? 
 
Q. Conclusive tests on the possible medical        STRONGLY FAVOR....31% 
uses of marijuana have not been completed.         SOMEWHAT FAVOR.....24 
Would you favor or oppose making marijuana         SOMEWHAT OPPOSE....15 
legally available for medical uses, even           STRONGLY OPPOSE....27 
though testing has not been complete? 
 
Q. People who find that marijuana is effective     STRONGLY AGREE....60% 
for their medical needs, like treating glaucoma    SMWHT AGREE........23 
and relieving nausea from chemotherapy, should     SMWHT DISAGREE......3 
be able to use it legally.                         STRONGLY DISAGREE...8 
 
<b>2. Fewer than half the respondents thought the argument most often posed 
by opponents of medical marijuana was convincing, i.e. that legalizing 
marijuana for medical purposes would lead to more social use, and the 
largest group thought it was " very unconvincing":</b> 
 
Q. Is the following argument very convincing, somewhat convincing, somewhat 
unconvincing or very unconvincing as a reason for keeping marijuana 
illegal: 
 
> Legalizing marijuana for medical uses        Very  Smwht  Smwht   Very 
will make it too easy for other people to      Conv  Conv   Unconv  Unconv 
get it and abuse it.                           25%   22     19      32</pre></html>
