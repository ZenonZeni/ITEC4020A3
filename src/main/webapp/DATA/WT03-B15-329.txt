<P>
BOISE -- 

     Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MK-NYSE) today announced its operating 
results for the fourth quarter ended November 30, 1996. On September 11, 
1996 Morrison Knudsen and Washington Construction Group, Inc. merged and 
the combined company was renamed Morrison Knudsen Corporation.  The 
results announced today combine those of the former Washington 
Construction Group from December 1, 1995 to November 30, 1996 and those of 
Morrison Knudsen from September 12, 1996 to November 30, 1996. 

<p>
     For the quarter ended November 30, 1996, MK posted net income of $5.6 
million, $.11 per share, on revenue of $416.7 million compared to net 
income of $2.9 million, $.10 per share, on revenue of $68.3 million for 
the fourth quarter of 1995.  Operating income in the fourth quarter was
$9.8 million compared to operating income of $3.2 million for the fourth 
quarter of 1995.

<p>
     &quot;We are very pleased with our operating results in the fourth 
quarter,&quot; said Robert A. Tinstman, MK president and chief executive 
officer. &quot;We ended the year in a strong financial position and with our 
recent major new work bookings, we are well positioned for the future.&quot;

<p>
     Tinstman noted that Morrison Knudsen ended its fiscal year debt free 
and with a net worth in excess of $300 million, unlimited bonding capacity 
and a $200 million line of credit.  Backlog of uncompleted contracts at 
November 30, 1996 was $3.5 billion.  In addition to $200 million in new
work booked in the fourth quarter of the company's fiscal year, major new 
contracts in the first month of the new fiscal year include two awards 
anticipated to provide approximately $500 million in revenue: the Idaho 
National Engineering Laboratory's Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Facility
and a chemical demilitarization project in Russia. 

<p>
     The Company said that after-tax adjustments of $11.4 million in the 
third quarter for write-downs on certain real estate properties and other 
non-core assets held for sale resulted in a net loss for the twelve months 
ended November 30, 1996 of $4.8 million, $.14 per share, on revenue of
$659.1 million compared to  net income of $8.2 million, $.28 per share, on 
revenue of $228.5 million for 1995.

will be held on April 11, 1997 at 10:00 a.m. at MK's world headquarters in
