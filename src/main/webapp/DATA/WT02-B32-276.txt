The Analyze command produces a breakdown of your Search results.  You'll easily be able to view the databases searched, keyword phrase, time, and the number of hits generated from the NewsNet database. <P>
 
To receive this analysis, simply type ANALYZE  at the prompt after you conduct a search (Enter HEAd, for Headlines...) or, in Baton, simply click on the button Analysis of Hits by Title and your analysis will appear.<P>

At this time, you have the chance to display the headlines from a specific title.  Simply enter HEAD-DISPLAY and the title code(s) or industry codes(s) of interest and the headlines from the specified title will appear.  <P>

You can also exclude headlines in native mode by typing HEAD-EXCLUDE and the title code(s) or industry code(s) to be excluded.  In Baton, you can exclude titles from your search results when your search analysis is displayed. <P>

Reviewing the results may help you redefine your search further, and may be kept as an offline record of your search strategy to assist you with future search sessions.<P>
