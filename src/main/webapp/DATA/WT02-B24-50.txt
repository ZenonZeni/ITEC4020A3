<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Learning Disabilities and Educational Standards</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>October, 1995 </b></p>

<p>A major part of the educational reform is an emphasis on standards.
Efforts to ensure higher levels of competence in students inevitably focus
on higher and more rigorous standards. These increased standards are intended
to strengthen both student competence and teacher skills. </p>

<p>Higher or more rigorous educational standards can effect students with
learning disabilities in significant ways. However, little data or research
yet indicates the effects on changes in standards. Often standards that
offer the greatest promise for educational reform, raise the greatest concern
for individual students with learning disabilities. Thoughtful questions
need to be asked about many areas in which there are proposed changes in
standards. </p>

<ul>
<li><b>High school graduation standards.</b> In many states and districts,
more demanding courses (i.e. algebra, geometry, or foreign languages) are
required for a diploma. Similarly, basic and vocational classes such as
consumer mathematics and slower paced regular classes that are awarded
Carnegie units are being phased out because they are less challenging or
the teachers are needed to teach more advanced classes. 
<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;If a student cannot pass one of these classes, can a course
substitution be written into the IEP and accepted toward the
diploma?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>High school competency testing</b>. Some states use a passing score
on a competency or exit exam as a graduation requirement. While some modifications
are permitted, others may not be allowed. Some newer examination formats
claim to test reading by asking for a paragraph-length written response.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;Are appropriate modifications permitted? Are students with
IEP's permitted to take an unmodified test if desired? Does the test format
allow the student with specific disabilities to show the ability being
tested?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Reporting standardized test results.</b> Sometimes students with
disabilities are actively discouraged from participating in testing because
lower group scores may result. In other situations, students with disabilities
are required to participate in testing which may be frustrating and self-defeating
even when accommodations are provided. The National Center on Outcome Education
and Fair Test advocate the collection of data by disability category in
order to establish accountability. 

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;Are students discouraged from or pressured to participate
in testing? How are test results reported? Are test scores a meaningful
measure of teaching skill? of learning?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Differentiated or tiered diplomas.</b> Some states award attendance
certificates, standard diplomas, and advanced diplomas that each have different
course and competence requirements. Other states are eliminating all diplomas
except the advanced diploma in order to ensure high standards.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;What impact will an IEP, competency testing, accommodations,
course substitutions, or other factors have on the type of diploma received?
How early must a student decide which diploma to seek? Will employment,
vocational training, or college entrance be affected by the diploma(s)
available? What value will be placed on the diploma that students with
learning disabilities receive?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Admission to apprenticeships and other postsecondary options.</b>
In order to ensure a perceived competence level, some unions, professions,
and postsecondary programs establish criteria or entrance tests without
provision for accommodations or individualized consideration. Entrance
into a trade, for example, may require extensive written responses unlike
that needed for successful work in that trade.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;How can groups be Informed more accurately about the nature
of learning disabilities and the individual differences that characterize
them? Can legal means be used to establish needed and appropriate flexibility?&quot;</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Academic standards developed by professional groups.</b> Organizations
of content specialists and educators have been asked to establish content
and teaching approaches for elementary curricula and high school courses.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;How can groups be informed more accurately about the nature
of learning disabilities and the individual differences that characterize
them? How can parents and professionals knowledgeable about learning disabilities
participate in the development of academic standards?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Formation of charter schools.</b> The establishment of &quot;charter
schools&quot; that use a specific alternative approach to education for
a specified population with exemption from most state laws are being encouraged
by some states.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;To what extent will students with disabilities be included
in or excluded from charter schools? If included, how will the rights of
students with disabilities be protected? If excluded, how will students
with disabilities gain access to the education offered by charter schools?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Student test scores as a measure of educational success.</b> Some
states, districts, and programs use achievement or competency scores to
measure teacher success or compare success among school or school district.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;Is a test score useful as a single measure of teaching
or learning success? How can test scores be most effectively used to improve
learning? Are the scores of students with learning disabilities included,
excluded, or presented as a separate category?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Changes in teacher certification.</b> Many states are changing the
process and criteria for certifying or licensing teachers. Those with military
or business backgrounds are provided alternative certification. Liberal
arts and science content is emphasized over teaching methods and knowledge
of the specialized needs of students with disabilities. A private National
Board of Professional Standards is establishing voluntary certification
based on portfolio and other evidence.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;Are general education teachers developing skills needed
for mainstreaming and inclusion? Are teachers for students with moderate
and severe learning disabilities required to possess real competence in
basic skill instruction, clinical diagnostics, consultation, technology,
collaboration, and transition? How are teachers who come from primarily
liberal arts, science, or alternative certification routes prepared to
work with students who have learning disabilities? How do school system
constraints or flexibilities and other factors effect the success of competent
teachers?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Dropout rate</b>. A pervasive concern is the effect that more rigorous
standards may have on self-esteem and thus, on the already high dropout
rate. Some students may be frustrated by academic criteria, competency
tests, and other seemingly impossible expectations. The important motivation
of a diploma as a key to postsecondary training and/or employment may also
seem even less attainable. A probable result is increased drop out rates
among students with learning disabilities. 

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;What procedures for collecting dropout data will be used?
What special efforts will be made to encourage students with learning disabilities
to stay in school? Will participation in sports, clubs, and other attractive
activities be curtailed If specific academic criteria are not met?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<p>LDA fully supports the efforts of educational reform to improve the
skills, competence, and attitudes of America's students and workforce to
increase competitiveness within the world market. However, these efforts
must be balanced by the need to nurture the unique abilities and talents
of each individual with learning disabilities. The questions raised here
must be communicated to parents, professionals, taxpayers, legislators,
and educational administrators before education reform is implemented.
The future education of individuals with learning disabilities may be at
stake. </p>
