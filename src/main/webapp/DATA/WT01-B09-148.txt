<B>Project Title: Rapid Charge System with Flywheel Energy Storage<p>
Performing Organization: Northrop Grumman</B><p>

<P>Technical Contact:  Bruce Lenderking (410) 765-0620
</P>

<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>Northrop Grumman and Trinity Flywheels are combining talents in this program to provide a rapid charging system for electric vehicles with an integrated energy storage system, to reduce the impact of the system on the utility power supply grid.  The flywheel energy storage system will be designed to reduce the peak power demand of the charging system by 50%, thereby dramatically reducing the costs of supplying energy to electric vehicles during rapid charging.</P>

	<P>Northrop Grumman (formerly Westinghouse Electric Corporation) has developed a prototype rapid charging system for electric vehicles, with a rated capacity of 130 kW.  For a typical light-duty electric vehicle, this system will provide a rapid recharge in 15-20 minutes.  This program will integrate with this charging unit a Trinity Flywheel energy storage system of 25 kWh capacity, designed to operate at 60-70 kW, to provide up to 50% of the power requirement.  After a charging cycle, the flywheel system is planned to be recharged at less than 50 kW, to reduce peak power demands.</P>

	<P>The Northrop/Trinity unit will be designed and developed for light-duty fleet applications.  The prototype unit will be tested under controlled conditions at the Northrop Grumman facility in Maryland.</P>

<P><B>Milestones</B>	</P>

<P>During the first twelve months of the project, the flywheel system and the rapid charging unit will be designed and fabricated.  During months 12-17, the flywheel and charging systems will be integrated and tested.</P>
