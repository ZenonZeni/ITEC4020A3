In terms of its ability to raise the nation's blood pressure, the
debate over data encryption has not yet reached the same levels as gun
control.
<p>        
But last week the Clinton Administration appeared to set the stage
for an equally divisive national debate over the rights of businesses and
individuals to keep secrets when using telephones, computers and other
forms of electronic communications.
<p.        
In two days of public hearings last week in Gaithersburg, Md., home
of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
Administration in effect unveiled its long-awaited proposals to relax
restrictions on the export of cryptographic software.
<p> 
In effect, the Administration drew a line in the virtual sands of
cyberspace, signaling that it is willing to permit Americans to put
stronger cryptographic locks on their electronic data only if a spare key
to those locks is made available on demand to law enforcement agencies.
<p>       
There looms the conflict. Although the current debate is about
export controls on an esoteric form of software that most Americans do not
use, the "export" issue is ultimately irrelevant in today's era of global
electronic voice and data networks, where passwords, not passports, are
checked at the gates. Simply placing a common privacy program on an
Internet-connected computer in Austin, Tex., is effectively no different
from sending a shrink-wrapped copy of the program to Moscow.
<p>       
The real issue is how much privacy the Government is willing to
allow its own citizens, and the latest word from the Clinton Administration
is that the right to electronic privacy, like the right to bear arms, is
not absolute.
<p>

Cryptography is the science of secret writing. In this digital era,
secret writing applies not just to notes handed from one spy to another,
but also to telephone calls between individuals, funds transfers between
banks, bank and credit card records, electronic mail, faxes, and an endless
variety of computer files.
<p>
The Clinton Administration has been clear and consistent in
outlining its basic position on cryptographic systems. The goal is to allow
American citizens and companies to use the strongest possible cryptographic
technology, while at the same time preserving the ability of law
enforcement agencies to perform court-authorized wiretaps as part of the
effort to catch drug dealers, terrorists, child pornographers and other
miscreants.
<p>        
In other words, it favors strong cryptography, but not too strong.
<p>       
One way to measure the strength of cryptographic software is the
length of the software key necessary to encode and decode a message. The
longer the key, in terms of digital bits, the harder it is for an
unauthorized user to decipher the message.
<p>        
In recent years, the Government has generally permitted Americans
to export cryptographic software with key lengths up to 40 bits. Experts
say that 40-bit keys are secure from casual snooping, but will fall quickly
to a determined codebreaker. The fact that the Government allows 40-bit
encryption systems to be exported is a pretty good indication that the
National Security Agency can break them easily.
<p>        
There are literally hundreds of stronger cryptography programs
readily available outside the United States, and these stronger programs
are attractive to businesses that want to safeguard their data from
Internet bandits and corporate and government spies.
<p>        
Last week, after more than a year of intense analysis of the
software export controls issue, the Government unveiled what it said was
the best possible compromise.
<p>        
Under the new policy, companies can export encryption algorithms
using 64-bit keys, which are much more secure, but only if spare keys are
made available to law enforcement agents under standard legal procedures.
Otherwise, the 40-bit limit continues to apply.
<p>        
The "spare key" technology, officially known as key escrow, is
anathema to many privacy advocates who fear Government abuses. The
Government first proposed a key escrow system with its so-called Clipper
Chip, a technology that failed to win acceptance even as a voluntary
standard.
<p>        
Unlike Clipper, which was based on a classified algorithm called
Skipjack that only a few people outside the Government were allowed to
examine, the new policy allows people to use any algorithm they choose --
as long as it uses a key no larger than 64 bits, and as long as the keys
are entrusted to a domestic third party accessible to the Government, and
as long as the key escrow mechanisms cannot be readily altered or bypassed.
<p>        
Also unlike Clipper, which required a special tamper-proof
microprocessor that would have added cost, complexity and extra power
requirements to communications devices, the new proposals can be
implemented entirely in software.
<p>        
Key escrow systems make a lot of sense for most American companies,
at least for internal use. Having a spare set of keys lessens the risk of a
disgruntled employee or saboteur locking up vital company files.
<p>        
But key escrow is also unpopular with American computer and
software companies, who say it prevents them from competing against foreign
companies that have no similar constraints, and with many multinational
corporations, who say it prevents them from working with foreign companies
that don't especially care for the idea of Uncle Sam holding the keys to
their data banks.
<p>        
"If this was intended to be any sort of compromise, I don't think
it achieved its end," said Whitfield Diffie, a Distinguished Engineer at
Sun Microsystems who attended the meetings. "I didn't see anybody who was
enthusiastic."
<p>
<center>***</center>
<p>
Raymond G. Kammer, deputy director of NIST, suggested that the
hearings last week were intended to elicit public comment, and that the
Administration's final position on cryptographic policy are still under
analysis.
<p>        
However, the emergence of key escrow issues at the NIST proceedings
suggest that key escrow is emerging as a non-negotiable demand by some
factions of the Clinton Administration, especially the Justice Department
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, led by Louis Freeh. Mr. Freeh
sincerely believes that data encryption is a weapon, and has publicly
called for domestic restrictions on civilian cryptography.
<p>        
"If this fails," said one observer familiar with the Administration's 
thinking on the proposed change in cryptographic policy, "it's going to 
lead to a very devisive debate. And the irony, for libertarians who 
oppose key escrow, is that if it fails, I am convinced that Louis Freeh 
cannot be true to his job without proposing domestic
controls on data encryption."
<p>        
"He's not going to give up without a fight, and neither is the
Justice Department," said the observer, who spoke on the condition he not
be identified.
<p>
Others say they do not think the Clinton Administration has yet
arrived at a concrete position, even after more than a year of study and
debate. "I don't think it's a final offer," said John Gilmore, a member of
the board of directors of Cygnus Support Inc., a computer company in
Mountain View, Calif. "It looks to me like a weak strawman, a first offer,
a proposal to dance."
<p>        
The question is whether American citizens and businesses have the
patience to wait for the music to start. And the issue may be moot, anyway.
<p>        
"The Internet Architecture Board has specifically decided to ignore
export controls in designing the security infrastructure for the next
generation of Internet protocols," Mr. Gilmore said. "The Internet of 1998
will provide automatic, secure, and fully private communication, without
key escrow, internationally. The protocols will be implemented
independently in a dozen different countries."
<p>        
In other words, the international Internet community is already
planning to jump over the new line in the sand drawn last week by the
Clinton Administration. Cryptography that is stronger and better than the
Government's proposed system will become an integral part of the Internet,
and American companies and individuals would be foolish not to use it.
<p> 
At that point, millions of Americans will come in direct conflict
with Government policy, and the popular gun-control bumper sticker may be
replaced by one that says, "If cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws will
have cryptography."
