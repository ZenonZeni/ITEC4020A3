GREENHOUSE DISPUTE CLOSES THE CURTAIN ON BUSH'S ENVIRONMENTAL
HONEYMOON (NEWS ANALYSIS)

by Dennis Wamsted
The tenuous year-old truce between President Bush and the
environmental community was breached, perhaps irreparably, this
week as long-simmering differences between the two sides on
global warming, the pending reauthorization of the Clean Air Act
and Bush's no-net-loss policy on wetlands all surfaced in heated
public disagreements. The spark for the public split was the
president's speech before the meeting of the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) here in Washington.

In his speech, Bush stressed the U.S.' commitment to the IPCC
process and "aggressive and thoughtful action on environmental
issues." As part of this commitment, Bush announced his intention
to host a White House conference on science and economic research
on the environment. In addition, the president reminded the
delegates of the U.S.' budgetary commitment to environmental
protection. The new budget includes more than $2 billion in new
spending for environmental protection, he said, with $1 billion
earmarked specifically for the U.S. Global Change Research
Program.

"That commitment, by far the largest ever made by any nation,
reflects our determination to improve our understanding of the
science of global change," Bush said. "We are working with our
neighbors around the world to enhance global monitoring and data
management, improve analysis, reduce the uncertainty of
predictive models and conduct regular reassessments of the state
of science."

Beyond this global climate change R&D initiative, the
administration has "already taken many steps...that bring both
economic and environmental research. Steps that make sense on
their own merits in terms of responsibility and efficiency, which
help reduce emissions of chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide
and other pollutants now entering the atmosphere."

Still, the president refused to endorse immediate action to
freeze or reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the principal
greenhouse gas, in an effort to slow the projected rise in global
temperatures in the next 50 years or so. "You're called upon to
deliver recommendations which strike a difficult yet critical
international bargain: a convergence between global environmental
policy and global economic policy," Bush told the IPCC delegates.
"Human activities are changing the atmosphere in unexpected and
in unprecedented ways," Bush continued, but many questions remain
unanswered. "Together, we have a responsibility to ourselves and
the generations to come to fulfill our stewardship obligations.
But that responsibility demands that we do it right.

"Some may be tempted to exploit legitimate concerns for political
positioning," Bush added, concluding: "Our responsibility is to
maintain the quality of our approach, our commitment to sound
science and an open mind to policy options."

Bush's refusal to call for immediate action was assailed by the
environmental representatives at the IPCC meeting. The
president's speech "was just a lot of hot air," said Dan Becker,
the director of the Sierra Club's Global Warming & Energy
Program. Bush's promise to plant a billion trees a year in the
U.S. is akin to throwing sponges into Prince William Sound to
clean up the oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez tanker. "Sununu
won," Becker added, referring to the intra-administration debate
regarding global warming in which Sununu has taken the go-slow
approach.

The speech had "no new direction, no substantive steps" to attack
the global warming problem, added Brooks Yeager, vice president
of government relations for the National Audubon Society, who
said that the environmental community had hoped Bush would
endorse a CO2 reduction policy. Instead, the administration
continues to oppose even the automotive CO2 emissions standard
included in the Senate's version of the pending Clean Air Act
reauthorization. A national policy on CO2 reductions must be the
first order of business, continued Rafe Pomerance, who is
affiliated with the World Resources Institute.

These concerns were echoed by a number of the environmental
community's strongest supporters in Congress. The president's
speech was disappointing, Sen. Tim Wirth (D-Colo.) said. "We
ought to be doing a lot more right now," he said after Bush's
presentation, citing in particular the need for additional
emphasis on energy efficiency measures, alternative fuels and
population control. I am concerned that the administration
appears "unable to move forward."

Later, in a speech on the Senate floor, Wirth urged his
colleagues to act--even if the administration refuses to
cooperate. "It bewilders me why we do not take a leadership role.
It bewilders me why the steps that are so obvious to be taken are
not begin taken."

Wirth's comments were seconded by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.),
who blasted Bush for his inaction. "Having shed his alleged wimp
image in the conduct of foreign affairs, the business of
resurrecting that wimp image in the conduct of our environmental
policy."

Similar concerns were broached this week regarding the
administration's commitment to clean air. "[Bush] has abandoned
his commitment to clean air for all Americans and even threatened
to veto the bipartisan compromise...now pending in the Senate,"
Richard Ayres, the chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition
said in a statement. "The administration is attempting to force a
back-room negotiation aimed at eliminating every single
improvement the Environment Committee made in the administration
bill."

NEW EPA RULE THREATENS VIRGINIA COAL PROJECTS

by Kennedy Maize
A unilateral decision by EPA Region III regarding PSD or
prevention of significant deterioration requirements for new
coal-fired generating facilities, "unless quickly corrected, will
delay and may prevent the development of generating capacity
needed for continued reliable electric service in Virginia,"
Daniel Bird, Virginia's Coal and Energy Commission chairman,
warned in a letter to Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) late last month.

In addition, Bird wrote, the region, which covers Virginia, is
being tougher on pollution control technologies than Region IV,
which covers North Carolina. As a result, "investment in
generating projects and the resulting employment and economic
benefits may shift from Virginia to North Carolina."

According to Bird, prior EPA policy based air modeling for the
PSD program, which governs the construction of new pollution
sources in clean air areas, on the assumption that sources would
emit at their historic rates. But EPA unilaterally decided that
modeling should instead be based on the maximum allowable rate.
"This policy change was made without notice to the public and did
not become apparent until project developers began filing air
permit applications during 1989," wrote Bird. "In March of 1989,
EPA advised the states that modeling on the basis of allowable
emissions would be required by October 1989."

Bird noted that many cases in Virginia show that "a wide gulf
exists between actual and maximum allowable emissions. Therefore,
EPA's shift in policy represented a drastic change that would
become effective while a number of projects that had been planned
and sited under the previous policy were in the process of
development."

Bird said he understands the reason for the EPA shift: The agency
has no assurance that emitters will not increase emissions. But
Bird wants EPA to come up with a transitional approach that does
not harm projects started under the old rules. "I would emphasize
that the commission does not quarrel with EPA's apparent
objective," Bird continued. "However, this rule's unnecessarily
large impacts and the lack of adequate notice...requires a prompt
adjustment in this policy."

Bird also said EPA Region III is "unduly aggressive" in
implementing "Best Available Control Technology" (BACT)
requirements. The EPA region, Bird wrote, "appears to be seeking
technologies providing 95 to 99 percent SO2 removal that have not
been adequately demonstrated to be effective and economic for the
same type of generating unit." But Region IV next door is not
requiring such stringent removal levels, Bird added.

Region III's ardor, said Bird, is also out of step with the Bush
Administration's proposals to cap sulfur dioxide emissions and
require offsets for new units. "Assuming that a cap is retained,"
Bird wrote, "total SO2 emissions will be controlled regardless of
how BACT requirements are applied." With caps, Bird argued, "no
purpose is served by forcing developers to a higher level of
control on new units than they consider economic. On the
contrary, a key principle underlying the president's proposals is
that the control be achieved at the lowest cost."

SRP: AN ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH PARK?

by Danialle Weaver
AIKEN, South Carolina--The Department of Energy's Savannah River
facility, located on 192,000 acres of reforested farmland in
western South Carolina, is a study in contrasts.

The site boasts state-of-the-art waste processing technology in
the Defense Waste Processing Facility (see story on page two), a
nearly complete facility that will render millions of gallons of
deadly defense wastes into a harmless glass matrix. At the same
time, the site serves as home to a weapons production technology
little changed in nearly four decades.

Like many of DOE's other weapons facilities, the site has been
designated a National Environmental Research Park that serves as
a refuge for five endangered species, including four bird
species--bald eagles, wood storks, red cockaded woodpeckers and
peregrine falcons--and one fish species, the short-nosed
sturgeon.

The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, operated on the site by
the University of Georgia, has a large environmental monitoring
effort to study the long-term health of the site's wildlife. In
fact, because the site's 320 square miles represent a virtual
oasis of greenery compared to the surrounding cropland, the DOE
facility is an excellent place to study the effects of genetic
isolation and natural selection in closed populations.

At the same time, the site also contains damnable examples of
environmental practices that have long since been disavowed,
notably seepage basins used for the land disposal of liquid low-
level wastes and low-level solid waste buried directly into the
ground.

One of the site's Carolina Bays--formed when the glaciers of the
ice age receded--was formerly home for several typical South
Carolina species of flora and fauna, including Venus flytraps and
alligators. But heavy metals and volatile organics, such as
trichloroethylene, from the nearby seepage basins seriously
contaminated the bay, which is now nicknamed "Lost Lake" by
workers at Savannah River.

Environmental restoration activities, including removing several
feet of lake mud and draining some of the lake water, have
helped, and life is slowly returning to Lost Lake. Seepage basins
and low level waste burial grounds are being cleaned up, capped
with a clay cap impermeable to rainwater and covered with new
vegetation.

DOE LOOKS TO VITRIFY ITS WASTE PROBLEMS AT THE SAVANNAH RIVER
FACILITY

by Danialle Weaver
AIKEN, South Carolina--In 1992, workers at the Department of
Energy's Savannah River site hope to write a new and hopeful
chapter in the long history of the U.S. struggle to find ways to
safely store the nation's most deadly radioactive waste for the
thousands of years it remains hazardous to human life and the
environment.

The solution, says Lucien Papouchado, manager of waste management
programs at Savannah River for Westinghouse Savannah River
Company, lies in vitrifying or glassifying the waste. Similar
technology has already been successfully adopted in France and
Belgium.

Although several waste vitrification facilities are slated to
begin operations in the U.S. in the 1990s and beyond, Savannah
River's $1.2 billion Defense Waste Processing Facility is
scheduled to come on-line first. The wastes generated by nearly
40 years of plutonium and tritium production at the site account
for 56 percent of the radioactivity in DOE's inventory of high-
level defense waste, according to recent estimates by the General
Accounting Office.

It took "15 years of R&D" to come up with the processes that will
be used at the DWPF, said Richard Begley, director of the
Savannah River Laboratory and a vice president for Westinghouse
Savannah River Company, the facility's operating contractor.
Bechtel served as architect-engineer for the facility and
Morrison-Knudsen served as the primary construction contractor.
Groundbreaking was held in late 1983.

Westinghouse and DOE plan to begin a series of "cold" processing
runs with simulated radioactive waste in September. Once the
facility begins operating, it will take approximately 15 years to
vitrify the 34 million gallons of liquid high-level waste already
stored at Savannah River.

The majority of DOE's liquid high-level defense waste is
generated in the process of recovering the uranium and plutonium
from the reactors' spent fuel rods. Before they ever reach the
vitrification facility, spent fuel rods are soaked in nitric acid
to dissolve the cladding. Then, the fuel itself is dissolved in
an aqueous solution of nitric acid, and an organic solvent is
used to separate the nitrates of uranium and plutonium from the
fission products.

Before the waste is placed in storage tanks, the acid is
neutralized with sodium hydroxide, and the radioactive elements
settle in a thick sludge on the bottom of the tanks. The liquid
on top, called supernate, makes up about 90 percent of the waste
and consists of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite.

The supernate, or salt solution, will then be evaporated at the
Savannah River saltstone facility, which is expected to start up
this year. The remaining "saltcake" will be treated to remove
cesium-137 and strontium, which will then be sent to the DWPF.
The saltcake will be mixed with cement, fly ash and furnace slag
and then pumped into a concrete storage vault, where it will cure
into a stable concrete. After the vault is filled, it will be
capped with clean concrete and backfilled with earth to isolate
it from rain and weathering.

At the vitrification facility, the waste will first be treated
with chemicals to remove the mercury introduced during
reprocessing. Then, the waste will be mixed with ground
borosilicate glass, fed into a melter and heated to 2,100 degrees
Fahrenheit. The melter is designed to turn a gallon of the waste
slurry into about four pounds of glassified waste at a rate of
228 pounds per hour. It will take about 16 hours to fill one
canister 85 percent full, according to Steve Sheetz, a senior
Westinghouse engineer.

Particles will be scrubbed from the waste gases generated by the
melter by water that is shot out of scrubber nozzles at very high
speed, trapping radioactive particles and separating them from
the gases. Any remaining particles will be caught by high
efficiency filters and a bed of sand.

From the melter, the waste will flow into stainless steel
canisters that are 10 feet high, 2 feet in diameter, and 3/8-inch
thick. The canisters, which weigh about 1,100 pounds empty, will
weigh approximately 4,800 pounds when filled, according to
Sheetz. The canisters hold about 3,700 lb. of glass. A temporary
plug will then be inserted, and the canisters decontaminated to
Department of Transportation standards using a slurry of ground
glass, Sheetz continued. Once they are decontaminated, the
canisters will be permanently sealed with a steel plug forced in
place by 70,000 pounds of hydraulic pressure. A 23,000 amp
current will then be applied to the plug for about two seconds,
resulting in a weld "far superior" than those from conventional
welding techniques, Sheetz said.

The canisters will then be transferred to a temporary glass waste
storage building, which Sheetz manages, where they will be stored
in below-ground concrete vaults until they can be shipped to a
federal repository.

All major operations at the facility will be performed by remote
control. Before equipment was installed in the facility,
engineers created full-scale mock-ups of the equipment to ensure
that it could be maintained and repaired via remote control.
Equipment can be removed and replaced using an overhead crane or
repaired in place using mechanical arms placed at strategic
locations along the walls of the facility.

NSWMA APPEALS ALABAMA HAZARDOUS WASTE COURT CASE

The National Solid Wastes Management Association has appealed a
federal District Court ruling that upheld Alabama's controversial
hazardous waste disposal legislation, the association announced
late last month. The court, in a January 12 ruling, upheld a law
that enables the state to ban shipments of hazardous waste from
states that do not have waste disposal facilities of their own.

NSWMA General Counsel Bruce Parker challenged the logic used by
the court in its ruling. "The issue of whether or not states have
complied with federal law to deal with their own hazardous wastes
cannot be used as independent grounds for allowing a state like
Alabama to violate the Constitution," Parker said, adding: "It is
our belief that the January 12 opinion did not address all of the
legal points we challenged in our suit and it improperly applied
some basic tenants of constitutional law."

The association is also concerned about the decision's impact on
the much-delayed Superfund clean-up program, Parker continued.
"We are sympathetic with Alabama's concerns that other states may
not have completed the required hazardous waste capacity
assurance process, but we can not allow Alabama to violate the
Constitution in an attempt to force other states to develop their
own hazardous waste management plans."

The association and Chemical Waste Management Inc., the owner of
the Emelle disposal facility affected by the decision and a joint
party to the lawsuit, filed their appeal with the Eleventh U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, along with a request for an
expedited briefing and hearing schedule.

The court's decision could have a negative impact on Chemical
Waste Management's stock, Debra Coy, an analyst with Washington
Analyst Corporation, warned in a recent issue of `Capital
Comments.' To date, the decision has not hurt the company's stock
price, Coy wrote. "However, we believe there's a good chance the
decision could be upheld, setting a precedent for other states
that want to restrict imports of waste, both solid and hazardous.
We also believe there could be an impact on landfill earnings if
some of the waste banned from the site is diverted to
competitors' landfills. We believe the recent court
decision...may be more worrisome to Chemical Waste Management
than most industry analysts have anticipated."

SENATE ENERGY HEARS KEY DOE NOMINEES

Two Department of Energy nominees received a friendly reception
from members of the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee
during a joint confirmation hearing on Monday.

Highlighting his technical training, managerial capability and
public service experience, John Bartlett, nominated as director
of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, pledged
"open, frequent and effective interactions with Congress" and
said he "hopes to achieve respect for DOE's management" of the
waste program during his tenure. Before becoming a DOE consultant
in November 1989, Bartlett directed energy and environment work
for The Analytic Sciences Corporation of Reading, Massachusetts.

Robert Gentile, nominated to become DOE's assistant secretary for
Fossil Energy, told the committee: "We're entering a new era in
which environmental rhetoric is being replaced by environmental
action yet we must at the same time be assured of an adequate
supply of energy at reasonable costs." Gentile was previously the
director of the Department of the Interior's Office of Surface
Mining.

NATURE CONSERVANCY BUYS GRAY RANCH

The Nature Conservancy has purchased the 321,703-acre Gray Ranch
in southwestern New Mexico, the Arlington, Virginia-based
organization announced last week. The purchase, for an
undisclosed amount, of the 502.6-square-mile parcel is believed
to be the largest private land acquisition in conservation
history. "The purchase of Gray Ranch is a milestone in
conservation history," said John Sawhill, the incoming president
of the Conservancy. "Few intact natural systems of this caliber
exist in the world today. The Gray Ranch also represents the
future trend for The Nature Conservancy and its partners. To
truly insure our natural world for future generations, we are
developing creative ways to safeguard much larger landscapes."

LUKEN ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT, DECISION LIKELY TO INFLUENCE RCRA
DEBATE

Rep. Thomas Luken (D-Ohio), the chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee,
announced late last month that he would not seek reelection this
fall. The announcement, which was something of a surprise, could
have a significant impact on reauthorization of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act, which is now pending before
Luken's subcommittee.

The 64-year-old's decision to retire will open a coveted seat on
the Energy and Commerce Committee when the 102nd Congress
convenes next year. Chairmanship of Luken's subcommittee will
likely be assumed by Rep. Al Swift (D-Wash.).

(H.R. 3520) that would tighten existing regulations on the
transportation of hazardous wastes. The bill would authorize the
hiring of 200 additional federal inspectors to enforce the new
regulations, which would require the Department of Transportation
to register companies that ship hazardous waste and require
companies that haul extremely hazardous material, such as
radioactive wastes and poisons, to obtain federal safety
permits.

JONTZ LAUDS BUSH FORESTRY PROPOSAL

The Bush Administration's plan to plant one billion trees at a
cost of $175 million should be linked with a reduction in the
number of trees cut on public lands in the Pacific Northwest,
Rep. Jim Jontz (D-Ind.) said last week. "With the president's
proposal, trees are finally receiving the attention they deserve
as the most cost-effective means of addressing the global warming
problem," Jontz said. "But to be responsible stewards of our
nation's environment, we must also take steps to stop the
destruction of our remaining old growth ancient forests. It is
ironic that at the same time the president proposes to do a
better job replanting trees where they were once cut, we are
liquidating our most magnificent forests faster than ever
before."

Jontz, a member of the House Agriculture forests, family farms
and energy subcommittee, is the sponsor of legislation (H.R.
2144) that would significantly boost federal support for urban
forestry initiatives. The bill, which passed the House in
November and is now pending before the Senate Agriculture
Committee, would establish a matching fund plan for urban areas
interested in setting up forestry programs. The fund would give
interested urban areas a dollar in federal money for every dollar
raised from local sources.

DELAWARE'S ROTH PUSHES `CLUNKER' INCENTIVE FOR EPA

Sen. William Roth (R-Del.) introduced legislation (S. 2049) last
week that would authorize the Environmental Protection Agency to
provide incentives to remove pre-1980 model year automobiles from
the country's highways. There are roughly 22 million cars still
on the road dating from before 1980, Roth said, and these autos
are "some of the biggest polluters on our nation's highways."
Overall, there are roughly nine million cars dating from before
1975 and another 13 million from the 1976-1979 model years.
Together, these two groups emit 1.1 million tons of hydrocarbons
a year--or somewhere between 15 percent and 30 percent of the
total annual automobile-generated hydrocarbon emissions.

"In fact," Roth continued, "I have heard estimates run as high
as 40 percent when one considers evaporative losses and other
losses, and it has been stated that about 60 percent of the
transportation-sector hydrocarbon emissions in southern
California come from clunkers."

The clean air legislation pending in the Senate ignores this
crucial source of pollution, Roth said, adding that his bill
would amend this shortcoming. The incentives in the Delaware
Republican's bill would focus principally on the existing
Corporate Average Fuel Economy or CAFE system. Specifically, the
legislation would give the manufacturers of newer automobiles
credits under the CAFE program whenever a post-1980 model was
sold to an individual trading in a pre-1980 automobile. To
qualify for this credit, which would be based on the difference
in gas mileage between the two automobiles, the manufacturer
would have to prove that the engine block and body of the older
car have been permanently removed from the road. Fines for
companies that do not comply would total $2,000 per car.

The legislation would be beneficial to all parties, Roth said.
"I can foresee a scenario where the owners of these clunkers
become valuable customers when they drive onto the new car lot
looking for a new fuel efficient, low-polluting car." For
example, a manufacturer could receive a CAFE credit of some 30
miles per gallon (mpg) if a customer trades in an older vehicle
getting just 10 mpg for a newer one at 40 mpg. Further, depending
on the size of the CAFE credit, part of the bonus could be
earmarked for the buyer to reduce the cost of the new
automobile.

"Consequently, the bill is good for everyone--for the
manufacturer, the retailer, the owner, but most importantly, for
the environment. We need to encourage more fuel efficient, safer
environmentally sound methods of transportation. This would be a
very good beginning," Roth concluded.

LOCAL ANGLE TOPS ENVIRONMENT AGENDA

by John Egan
HOUSTON--When it comes to the environment, many Americans seem to
have adopted an "out of sight, out of mind" attitude, according
to a nationwide survey commissioned by Cambridge Energy Research
Associates. A majority of those polled said they would help fund
local environmental issues, but far fewer people would be ready
to fund more geographically diffuse and intangible issues like
acid rain and global warming, adds the report, released here on
Monday in conjunction with CERA's annual executive meeting.

The study, `Energy and the Environment: The New Landscape of
Political Opinion,' was conducted by Cambridge, Massachusetts-
based Opinion Dynamics Corp. for CERA.

Mandatory recycling was favored by 88 percent of the 1,250 people
questioned in the survey. About 81 percent supported a ban on
non-biodegradable products, while 58 percent wanted to encourage
mass transit use by strictly limiting the amount of automotive
parking in cities.

Six out of ten of the respondents would "definitely" pay a one-
time $50 fee to help protect the nation's wildlife and wilderness
lands, according to the study. About 54 percent would also pay
the same-size tariff to clean up polluted water, while 50 percent
said they would dig into their pockets to help dispose of
hazardous chemicals and toxic wastes.

"The environmental consensus will be a major factor in the future
American political and business landscape," Daniel Yergin, CERA's
president, told a press conference where he unveiled the study.
"The popular-based support for environmental improvement cuts
across traditional demographic, partisan and ideological
divisions of American society, and could translate into far-
reaching political and economic consequences."

But while the public thinks the environment is important, other
issues are more pressing: Approximately 53 percent of those
surveyed said the U.S. government should spend more to battle
drug abuse. Uncle Sam should also spend more on public education,
according to 42 percent of those polled. By contrast, 40 percent
supported spending more to safely dispose of dangerous chemicals
and wastes, while only 28 supported spending more to clean the
nation's air.

As the issues covered by the survey became more global and less
tangible, fewer people said they would be willing to dig into
their pockets to support remediation efforts. Specifically, only
one-third of those surveyed would "definitely" give the U.S.
government $50 to counter either the greenhouse effect or acid
rain, according to the study. About 35 percent of those
questioned would give $50 to help solve municipal solid waste
disposal problems, while 37 percent were willing to fund programs
to counter ozone depletion. Slightly under half those surveyed
would spend $50 to help solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.

Nearly 20 percent of the respondents said they would refuse to
pay extra for efforts to curb diffuse problems like acid rain and
the greenhouse effect. By contrast, only about 10 percent of
those surveyed categorically refused to spend more of their money
on visible issues like protecting wildlife or cleaning up water
pollution.

Respondents differentiated between open-ended and one-time
tariffs. By a two-to-one margin they opposed cutting pollution
through a 50 cent per gallon gasoline tax. A majority also
rejected a 25 cent per gallon gasoline tax. "Open-ended taxes
with no dollar limits to be used for purposes only broadly and
vaguely defined do not win support from most Americans as an
acceptable price tag on environmental improvement," the report
warned.

Sixty-two percent of those surveyed believe that economic growth
and environmental clean-up can go hand-in-hand. If the economy
and the environment were locked in a zero-sum struggle, 74
percent would choose to have slower growth and a cleaner
environment. Only 16 percent of those queried would choose
economic growth over a cleaner environment.

EPA TARGETS PESTICIDE CONTAINERS: Farmer cooperation tops 90
percent

by Paul Kemezis
A successful pilot program to clean up and recycle pesticide
containers in Washington County, Mississippi could lead to
similar programs in several states, according to Environmental
Protection Agency officials familiar with the program.

Small, state-sponsored container collection efforts already exist
in Oregon and Maine, but a large-scale recycling program had
never been tried before in a densely farmed region. In addition,
the Mississippi pilot program was the first time that pressurized
spray cleaners were used and the empty high-density polyethylene
containers were sold for recycling, according to Robert Denny,
EPA's pesticide program manager.

Iowa is currently considering a statewide program and other
states, including North Dakota and Minnesota, have also expressed
interest in the pilot program's results. EPA, which provided
$80,000 for the Mississippi program, may allocate additional
funds from its special projects budget for similar programs,
Denny told Environment Week.

Washington County, which is located in a major cotton growing
region bordering the Mississippi River, launched the project in
the summer of 1989 to prevent used containers with pesticide
residues from being discarded in landfills, burned or simply
thrown in ditches. Farmers were given high pressure cleaning
equipment donated by ICI Americas Inc., and urged to flush the
containers and retain the pesticide residue to spray on fields.
After they were cleaned, the metal and plastic containers were to
be deposited at eight collection centers.

Mississippi Agriculture Dept. officials who ran the program say
the results were surprisingly good. All told, the department
collected 52,000 plastic containers and 48,000 pounds of metal
cans. Using a heavy publicity campaign including video tapes,
slide shows and local television ads, they estimate that they
achieved a 90 percent recovery rate. The program was totally
voluntary.

EPA's Denny says a principal goal of the program was to test the
results of the pressure rinsing, which has been shown to be 600
times more effective in removing residues than traditional triple
rinsing. The rinsing is particularly important because it
provides a cleaner product to sell to recyclers. Nevertheless,
use of the recycled plastic is still somewhat restricted because
of its previous pesticide contact.

Robert McCarty, deputy director of plant industry with the
state's Agriculture Dept., says the Washington County program
will continue next year using remaining EPA funds. The department
will also ask the legislature to fund a statewide program. While
the program generates some revenue from the sale of recycled
materials, it is not planned as a profit-making venture.

Notwithstanding the success of the pilot program, Denny says it
will be up to individual states to initiate and fund large-scale
programs. EPA plans to help by developing rules regarding
container shapes in order to make cleaning easier and also on
what can be used to construct the containers.

COALITION URGES $1 BILLION LAND PURCHASE PROGRAM

Congress should make better use of the billions of dollars
authorized for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to
acquire environmentally sensitive land and to create new public
recreation areas, a coalition of 20 national conservation groups
recommended in a report released last week. During the 1980s, the
coalition said, the unappropriated balance in the conservation
fund climbed from zero to more than $7 billion as the Reagan
Administration consistently failed to appropriate the funds
available. "During the 25th anniversary year of the Land and
Water Conservation Fund, we believe it is time to renew our
commitment to present and future generations through the
appropriation of $999 million in fiscal year 1991," the heads of
the 20 groups wrote in a cover letter accompanying the report.

Specifically, the coalition proposed spending:

 *  $253.05 million for land acquisition activities by the U.S.
    Fish and Wildlife Service;
 *  $249.18 million for the National Park Service;
 *  $242.98 million for the U.S. Forest Service;
 *  $200 million for state grants; and
 *  $54.15 million for the Bureau for Land Management;

The LWCF, which was signed into law by former president Johnson,
is composed primarily of revenues raised from leasing activity on
the Outer Continental Shelf and royalties associated with OCS oil
and gas production.

The coalition's report identifies lands in 46 states, the
District of Columbia and four U.S. territories that should be
purchased during the coming fiscal year. In crafting its
suggestions for land purchases, the coalition focused particular
attention on areas where there is a serious threat to land, water
or wildlife; willing sellers; existing acquisition efforts; and
existing or expected court orders that will require the federal
government to compensate landowners.

"During the fund's silver anniversary, we should be bold enough
to invest the $1 billion proposed in 1987 by President Reagan's
Commission of Americans Outdoors," urged Wilderness Society
president George Frampton in releasing the report. "Every day
there is less open space left in America, and unless we act
quickly, many of the natural treasures that our report recommends
for purchase will be gobbled up by subdivisions and other
speculators."

ARIZONA

Phoenix, Arizona's voluntary recycling pilot program has been so
successful in the past year that it will be expanded city-wide,
the city announced recently. The newly expanded program will
include 300,000 homes, compared to the 4,000 homes in the pilot
program. "This expansion will occur pending evaluation of
economics and end market agreements," said Jack Friedline, deputy
public works director for the city. "Full evaluation of the pilot
program will be made in the second quarter this year. If economic
analysis shows a benefit, we will recommend a multi-year
implementation program probably from 1991 to 1995."

CONNECTICUT

Connecticut's Department of Environmental Protection has awarded
$60,000 in grant funds to municipalities in the state's Central
Naugatuck Valley to boost regional recycling efforts. The funds
will be used by the Valley's council of governments to institute
a comprehensive regional recycling program for the area's roughly
370,000 residents. "This is one more important step forward for
Connecticut's recycling movement," DEP Commissioner Leslie
Carothers said in announcing the grant award. "This grant will
help add more than 10 percent of the state's population in the
Central Naugatuck Valley join the large numbers of citizens
already involved in regional recycling around Connecticut." The
grant will help the Valley's municipalities comply with a state
law mandating recycling for nine items by January 1, 1991,
including: glass and metal food containers, newspaper, corrugated
and white office paper, scrap metal, automotive batteries, used
oil and leaves.

Texaco Producing, Inc. for allegedly contaminating surface and
groundwater during the company's operations in the area. The
department is seeking to have the contamination cleaned up, and
to collect civil penalties and the cost of the investigation from
the company. "We have asked the court to make Texaco assess the
contamination and clean it up," said Steve Moeller, the state's
assistant attorney general. "We're also asking for civil
penalties of up to $5,000 per day, and the payment of $20,000 to
cover the cost of our investigation."

Environmental protection efforts have been a cornerstone of
Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey's administration, and 1990
will be no exception if the Republican governor has his way. In
his State of the State address late last month, Casey announced
the signing of an executive order requiring all new passenger
cars sold in the state to comply by 1994 with the tight emissions
standards now in effect in California. "To set the example,"
Casey continued, "I've ordered that all new state vehicles meet
these standards, effective immediately. In addition, we're going
to toughen up inspection standards so they cover emission control
devices."
