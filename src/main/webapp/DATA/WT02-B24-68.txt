<h1>Section 504 And Reasonable Accommodation Limitations</h1>

<p><b>Advocacy Memo: Legal Issues #6-96<br>
Advocacy Committee<br>
July 1996</b>

<p>Perry Zirkel, professor of education at Lehigh University, in a letter dated June 28, 1993, 
asked OCR to clarify whether the FAPE (free, appropriate public education) requirement under 34 
CFR §104.33 "incorporates a reasonable accommodation, reasonable modification, or other such 
cost-conscious limitation at least as applied to those students covered by Section 504" who are
ineligible under IDEA. Zirkel asked OCR to respond in light of court decisions such as 
<b>Southeastern Community College v. Davis,</b> 441 US 383, 410 (1979), <b>Alexander v. 
Choate</b>, US 287, 300 (1985), <b>Barnett v. Fairfax County School Bd.</b>, 
927 F.2d 146, 155 (4th Cir. 1991), and others, as well as "reasonable accommodation limitation 
under Title II" of ADA. 

<p>OCR responded that Section 504 regulations establish different standards of compliance for 
different settings. A reasonable accommodation limitation is contained in Subpart B covering 
employment and Subpart E covering postsecondary and vocational education. There is no such 
limitation, however, in Subpart D covering elementary and secondary education. OCR interprets 
the absence of any "cost-conscious limitation" in Subpart D, either in the original regulations or in 
subsequent actions by Congress or the courts, to mean that the writers of the regulations intended 
to create a different compliance standard in the elementary and secondary educational settings and 
the FAPE requirement of 34 CFR §104.33. 

<p>In the Supreme Court cases cited by Zirkel, OCR stated that the Court addressed modifications 
unrelated to either elementary or secondary education and ruled in both instances that  'substantial 
accommodations' were invalid only if they went beyond accommodations necessary to eliminate
 discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals. OCR explained that in all lower court cases
cited there was no need to alter the FAPE requirement of 34 CFR §104.33 If particular educational 
services requested by the plaintiffs were denied by the courts, it was because the courts found no 
discrimination was occurring. OCR stated the rulings were consistent with their interpretation that 
the FAPE regulation requires school districts to meet the individual needs of all students, disabled 
and nondisabled, to the same extent, "though not necessarily providing the same programs and 
services." 

<p>Because OCR adopted a specific FAPE requirement for Section 504 compliance in the 
elementary and secondary school setting, the general discrimination provisions, including any 
"reasonable accommodations limitation" of Title II, may not be applied to weaken the existing 
Section 504 standards.
