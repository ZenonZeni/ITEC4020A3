<H2><I>B. </I>Energy-Efficiency Investments Can Improve Competitiveness <BR>
<BR></H2>

The relatively low industrial energy prices in the United States are 
considered key competitive advantages in the global marketplace. However, 
these low prices also mean that U.S. manufacturers may place less 
importance on energy efficiency than do their competitors in Europe and 
Japan. This difference is illustrated in the selling prices of many 
products; one expert estimates that 5 percent of the difference in price 
between similar Japanese and American products is the result of more 
efficient energy use in Japanese plants.<a href="#47" name="r47"> [ 47 ] </a>U.S. industry can use energy 
efficiency to its competitive advantage.<BR>

<B><I> <p>     The <A NAME="BreyersCompany"> Breyers Company</a>.</B> </I>
In New England, public 
utilities have helped local businesses and industries compete and expand 
by investing more than $500 million in energy efficiency since 1987. The 
efficiency expenditures have lowered the energy bills of these companies, 
and have benefited the utilities by delaying the need to build expensive 
new generation plants.<a href="#48" name="r48"> [ 48 ] </a>When the Breyers Company ice cream plant in 
Framingham, Massachusetts was having difficulty staying competitive, 
<B><I><A NAME="BostonEdisonCompany">Boston Edison Company</a>,</B></I> the local utility, helped it install 
energy-efficiency improvements. The joint investment in energy-efficient 
refrigeration, heat-recovery systems, motors, and lighting reduced the 
plant's electricity use by 12.5 million kilowatt-hours (enough to power 
2,000 homes) while simultaneously improving product quality and adding new 
jobs.<a href="#49" name="r49"> [ 49 ] </a>The electricity savings cut annual carbon dioxide emissions by 
more than 8,275 metric tons.<a href="#50" name="r50"> [ 50 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="BigBearStores">Big Bear Stores </a>.</B></I> The Big Bear Stores grocery 
chain in Ohio and West Virginia has aggressively cut electricity bills by 
installing computer-controlled refrigeration and freezer display cases, 
lighting, and ventilation systems. Waste heat from the refrigeration units 
helps heat both the stores and hot water. Freezers, refrigerated display 
cases, and air-conditioning systems all use high-efficiency motors and 
compressors. Company-wide, electrical costs per square foot have decreased 
by approximately 15 percent, saving the company $1 million per year and 
helping it price its foods more competitively.<a href="#51" name="r51"> [ 51 ] </a>
<BR>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="Mar-Jac,Inc.">Mar-Jac, Inc.<a></B></I> Mar-Jac, Inc. is a poultry 
processor in Gainesville, Georgia that employs 550 people. Processing 
poultry requires water heated to between 120&#176; and 130&#176; F. The 
company used three natural gas-fired boilers to supply steam to the heat 
exchangers that heated the water. The boilers' low efficiency resulted in 
high energy costs, and maintenance was difficult and expensive.<a href="#52" name="r52"> [ 52 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      In 1988, the plant manager replaced the three steam boilers with 
two new water heaters capable of supplying water at up to 180&#176; F, and 
installed a new direct-fired gas water heater as well. Both process 
improvements resulted in substantial energy savings. The new system cost 
$210,000, but reduced gas consumption by 40 percent - resulting in a 
payback of less than 3 years. The process manufacturing investments 
improved safety, reduced the possibility of blowing a boiler, and lowered 
maintenance costs while cutting emissions.<a href="#53" name="r53"> [ 53 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      The DOE's EADC/IAC conducts free energy audits at small- and 
medium-sized manufacturing plants around the country. These audits have 
resulted in an estimated energy savings of $517 million (94 trillion Btu), 
at a total cost to taxpayers of $27 million. EADC/IAC has issued 
energy-saving recommendations for various businesses, including poultry 
processors. By installing even the six most recommended efficiency 
improvements, each poultry processor would spend an average of $7,912 
while saving $13,495 annually in reduced energy bills - and cutting 
carbon dioxide emissions each year by 304 metric tons. <a href="#54" name="r54"> [ 54 ] </a><P>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="ChrisErhartFoundryandMachineCompany"> Chris Erhart Foundry and Machine Company</a>.</B></I> Erhart 
Foundry in Cincinnati, Ohio produces iron castings for customers 
throughout the Midwest. The foundry has been in business for 140 years, 
but since the 1980s, the plant's effort to improve energy efficiency has 
been a "constant battle," says Dan Erhart. Energy comprises 15 to 20 
percent of total operating costs, and any reduction in consumption goes to 
improving the company's competitive position in the industry.<a href="#55" name="r55"> [ 55 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      In the early 1990s, Erhart called in <B><I><A NAME="CincinnatiGasElectric"> Cincinnati Gas  Electric </a></B></I> (CG&E) for an energy audit. Based on CG&E 
recommendations, Erhart replaced the foundry's 500 incandescent fixtures 
with high pressure sodium fixtures that provided twice as much light while 
using a third less energy.<a href="#56" name="r56"> [ 56 ] </a>
<p>    <p>      Erhart's biggest investment, however, was a change in its 
foundry process. The company installed a computer controller on its 
800-kilowatt induction furnace. Employees had been manually monitoring the 
furnace temperature, which made it extremely difficult to control demand. 
The controller is now reducing energy bills by 182 kilowatts per 
month - a 23 percent reduction - which saves $22,000 a year. The 
computer, which allows operation during off-peak hours and reduces the 
load during on-peak hours, paid for itself in six months. The energy 
savings shave 4 percent off Erhart's operating costs - a boon to 
productivity and competitiveness.<a href="#57" name="r57"> [ 57 ] </a>
