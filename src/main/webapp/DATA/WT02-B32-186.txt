<P><FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he innovative Dancehall Divas, managed by Junior Forbes (JFP Management), were united in 1993 by producer O'Neil Clarke.  They immediately formed a solid sisterly bond that constantly fuels their creative chemistry.  The Divas recently released their latest Mesa/Bluemoon album entitled Conspiracy.  Conspiracy features the fierce, hit-bound lead single "24 Seven."  Also in daring Divas style, "Conspiracy," a strong dancehall message song, confronts people caught up in life's negative cycles and embraces those whose lifestyles and pursuits are positive.
<p>

Lady English, Diva B, and Lesi are the three woman who comprise the Dancehall Divas.  Lady English (Vanessa Rose), a mesmerizing MC, is a native of Birmingham, England.  Her deejay style is spicy, bubbling, and on par with the best mic controllers in the business, including Lady Saw and Patra.  Ms. English originally made a name for herself as half of the reggae duo Lady English and Miss Linda.  Her resume also includes assisting in the formation of the popular female reggae group Worl A Girl and collaborating with R&B/pop star Cheryl Pepsi Riley on the hit single "Gimme."
<p>

Diva B (Beverly Lawrence) has been a singer, songwriter, and dancer since her formative years growing up in Kingston, Jamaica.  Diva B recorded and released five impressive singles with several of Jamaica's leading producers, including Sly and Robbie and Phillip Smart, who clearly appreciated her smooth, sultry voice.  Finally, Lesi (Elesia Cunningham) hails from Brooklyn where her Jamaican parents encouraged her to pursue her passions for modeling and singing.  Cunningham's soulful vocals, inspired by both her Caribbean heritage and urban New York sensibilities, create a harmonic balance that ingratiates the Divas expansive sound.
<p>

A classic example of a sum whose total is greater than its individual parts, the Dancehall Divas are truly ready for the world, and Conspiracy proves it on the vocal as well as production fronts.  Mixing hard-core dancehall with sexy R&B and sharp hip-hop edges, Conspiracy is a cross-cultural, ground-breaking album.
