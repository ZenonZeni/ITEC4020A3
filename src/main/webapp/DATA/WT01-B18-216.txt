<BR>
Geothermal energy is heat stored beneath the earth's surface. The amount 
of heat ultimately recoverable is dependent on the technology available to 
tap it. Some geothermal sites may be developed in a sustainable manner so 
that the heat withdrawn equals the heat being replaced naturally. 
Practically speaking, potential geothermal resources are so large that 
they are not considered depletable.<a href="#355" name="r355"> [ 355 ] </a>
<p>     Geothermal power has been in commercial production since about 1960, 
with the United States leading the world with more than 3,000 megawatts of 
installed capacity.<a href="#356" name="r356"> [ 356 ] </a>Since the early 1990s, however, geothermal 
development has been hindered by slumping U.S. energy markets in the West, 
where most of today's usable domestic geothermal resources are located. 
Despite a drop in geothermal electricity costs to between 4.5 and 7 cents 
per kilowatt-hour, low natural gas prices have made it difficult for 
geothermal to compete.<a href="#357" name="r357"> [ 357 ] </a>Nevertheless, because gas prices eventually will 
rise, geothermal resources have a tremendous potential to provide clean 
and sustainable energy in the future.<P>
<B><I> <p>    <A NAME="PacificGasandElectric">Pacific Gas and Electric <a>.</B></I> Electric 
utilities, primarily Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), were the first in 
the United States to build geothermal generating facilities. PG&E owns 
about three-quarters of the capacity of The Geysers, a 35-square-mile dry 
steam field in Northern California, that has an infrastructure investment 
of about $3.5 billion. The Geysers has about 500 wells, most of which are 
6,000 to 10,000 feet deep, tapping into a steam reservoir whose 
temperatures exceed 220&#176; Celsius. The field has been in production 
since 1960, but began to decline in 1988, when it reached a peak output of 
2,000 megawatts.<a href="#358" name="r358"> [ 358 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      PG&E has found geothermal to be highly economical. The first ten 
PG&E power plants at The Geysers - completed between 1960 and 
1974 - were all built for less than $200 per kilowatt. In the late 
1970s, however, the cost of new plants at The Geysers started to rise 
because less desirable sites were used. Two PG&E units brought on-line in 
1985 had an average capital cost of about $1,400 per kilowatt. More recent 
projects had an average capital cost of about $2,500 per kilowatt. <BR>
<p>     Despite the production decline at The Geysers, geothermal remains one 
of PG&E's lowest-cost sources of power over the life of the facilities, 
and in 1994 represented around 10 percent of PG&E's thermal generating 
capacity.<a href="#359" name="r359"> [ 359 ] </a>P>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="CaliforniaEnergyCompany, Inc."> California Energy Company, Inc.</a></B></I> California Energy 
Company, based in Omaha, Nebraska, is the world's largest independent 
geothermal power company, with operations in the United States, the 
Philippines, and Indonesia. The company operates 13 geothermal facilities 
with a total capacity of 575 megawatts, has contracted to provide over 
1,500 megawatts in the future, and has projects under construction 
totaling another 540 megawatts.<a href="#360" name="r360"> [ 360 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      In 1990, the California Energy Company received the National 
Environmental Achievement Award for its 288-megawatt Coso project at the 
U.S. Naval Weapons Center in Inyo County, California. The company plans to 
expand this facility - a nine-unit steam geothermal complex - to 
around 600 megawatts. <BR>
<p>    <p>      In 1995, California Energy acquired <B><I><A NAME="MagmaPowerCo.">Magma Power Co.<a> 
Co.,</B></I> another leader in the geothermal industry, and made it a 
wholly-owned subsidiary. Magma Power operates seven power plants (three 
purchased from Unocal in 1993) totaling 264 megawatts in the Salton Sea 
Known Geothermal Area in California's Imperial Valley.361 In 1993, 
California Energy sold 4,103 megawatt-hours of its geothermal electricity 
to <A NAME="SouthernCaliforniaEdison">Southern California Edison<a>. This geothermal electricity offset 1,407 
metric tons of carbon dioxide that otherwise would have been emitted by 
California's average generation mix.<a href="#362" name="r362"> [ 362 ] </a>

<P><A NAME="358"  HREF="#r358">358.</a> In 1994, production stood at about 1,250 megawatts. Field operators 
expect an additional 50 percent decline over the next 20 years, to about 
600 megawatts. Although industry estimates that only about 5 percent of 
the field's geothermal heat has been tapped, the decline stems from 
depletion of fluid in the field. Over-building has contributed to the 
fluid decline, as well as the practice of reinjecting only about 20 
percent of the fluid used in production (the other 80 percent is 
evaporated in cooling towers). By adding fluid from external sources, 
including reinjecting most of the produced fluid and modifying power plant 
design, The Geysers could supply at least several hundred megawatts of 
electricity for another 50 years. <I>Id., </I>p. 188.<BR>
