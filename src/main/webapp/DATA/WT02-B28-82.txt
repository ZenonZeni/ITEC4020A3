<STRONG><FONT SIZE="+1">New York Life Elects Sy Sternberg as its Next Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="-1">CEO Harry Hohn to Retire on April 1 
After 40 Years of Service</FONT>
</STRONG><P>

<STRONG>New York,  September 18, 1996</STRONG> - Sy Sternberg has been named chairman and
chief executive officer-elect by the Board of Directors of New York Life Insurance Company, and will take
the helm of the nation's 4th largest life insurer and a leading provider of managed health care and
financial services for individuals and businesses on April 1, 1997. <P>

Sternberg, 53, will succeed Harry G. Hohn, who will be retiring after 40 years with New York Life,
including seven years as its chief executive.  Sternberg, who has been president and chief operating
officer of New York Life since October 1995, also will retain the title of president. <P>

As New York Life's top executive, Sternberg will lead the Company's more than 12,000 employees and
10,000 agents and oversee all of its operations, including individual life and annuity, group life, health
and disability insurance, and financial and investment services for individuals and institutions.  These
operations include NYLCare, the company's fast-growing health benefits subsidiary that provides
managed care services to more than 3.5 million people nationwide, New York Life's life insurance
program offered through the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the Company's
MainStay family of mutual funds.	
<P>

"Sy Sternberg's high intelligence, drive, and total knowledge of our business make him the ideal leader
to take New York Life into the next century.  He is a brilliant strategist above all else," said Hohn, 64, who
joined the company as an attorney in 1956 following his graduation from New York University and the
Fordham University School of Law.<P>

"Harry Hohn has transformed New York Life into a truly diversified life insurance company, not to
mention one of the most financially secure companies in America," Sternberg said.  "Under his
leadership, the Company has taken a clear lead in instituting enhanced compliance procedures and a
comprehensive consumer protection program that is already serving as a model for the industry."<P>

Since joining New York Life eight years ago, Sternberg has revitalized the company's group health
insurance operations and spearheaded its highly successful growth strategies in the managed care
arena.  As head of the company's core individual insurance business, Sternberg reaffirmed New York
Life's commitment to agents as the primary marketing channel for the Company's products and
services.<P>

"My job will be to lead the best employees and agents in the business in adding even more luster to New
York Life's already outstanding franchise," Sternberg added. "In my view, no company is better situated
to successfully navigate the wide range of emerging challenges facing our industry, from increased
competition from banks and pending legislative changes in the health care arena, to intense public
scrutiny over the way insurance and other financial products are bought and sold." 	<P>

Before joining New York Life, Sternberg served as senior executive vice president and member of the
board of directors of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.  A Brooklyn native, he earned a
B.S. degree from the City College of New York in 1965 and an M.S. degree from Northeastern
University in 1968.  He is also a Chartered Life Underwriter.  Sternberg is a board member of the Health
Insurance Association of America, and serves on its committees on federal programs and health reform
strategies. 
<P>	
 
Mr. Sternberg is the father of two grown daughters, Jodi and Donna, and resides in Purchase, N.Y., with
his wife, Laurie, and their son, Matthew.<P>

New York Life, a Fortune 100 company, is one of the largest financial services companies in the United
States and the world.  New York Life has assets of more than $78 billion and reported total revenues of
$16.7 billion and net income of $625 million in 1995.  Founded in 1845 and headquartered in New York
City, New York Life and its affiliates offer traditional life and group insurance, annuities and managed
health care.  On the investment side, New York Life and its affiliates provide institutional asset
management, trust services, and 401(k) services.  One of its subsidiaries, NYLIFE Distributors Inc., offers
an array of securities products and services, such as institutional and retail mutual funds.
