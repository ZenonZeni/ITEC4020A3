<B>Problem/Opportunity</B>
<P>
Electric vehicles (EVs) help reduce oil imports and, potentially, greenhouse gas emissions, as well as improve air quality.  But, EVs are only one of several technologies that do so.  Total energy cycle analyses can be used to compare, from a complete system perspective, the environmental emissions, residuals, and total energy use of competing methods of providing energy services for similar end uses.  Such a comparison will make it possible to select the best means of reducing U.S. oil imports, greenhouse gas emissions, and air pollution without causing unintended impacts on the environment.  
<P>
<P>
<B>Approach</B>
<P>
The DOE is sponsoring several total energy cycle assessments (TECAs), including one for electric vehicles, the EVTECA. Argonne National Laboratory, through its Center for Transportation Research, is one of three national laboratories participating in the EVTECA.  TECAs examine the environmental effects of energy systems. They consider all energy-cycle stages, including raw material extraction, material transportation, conversion to an energy form (e.g., electricity), transportation of the energy form, and end use. The entire life cycle of each stage is included: construction and/or manufacturing, operation, and post-operation (e.g., disposal).

In the EVTECA, an emissions and residuals inventory of electric vehicles is being developed, as well as an inventory for comparable conventional vehicles fueled by reformulated gasoline (RFG). The emissions and residuals associated with vehicle and battery manufacturing, battery recycling and disposal, vehicle operation, electricity generation, production of RFG, and extraction and transport of feedstock for electricity and RFG will be included. Several scenarios of EV market penetration for the years 2000 and 2010 have been developed. EV use is being evaluated in four metropolitan areas with different utility fuel mixes, climate, transportation patterns, and environmental regulations. The regions selected for analysis are Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, and Washington, D.C. The scenarios also vary in terms of battery types, vehicle types, vehicle use patterns, and EV charging schedules.
<P>
The results of the scenario analysis are being incorporated into a total energy cycle analysis model, TEMIS (Total Emissions Model of Integrated Systems). The model will be used to estimate the emissions and residuals associated with electric and conventional vehicle use on a per vehicle mile of travel (VMT) basis. Both the scenario results and the per-VMT results will be presented in the final technical report of the project.

<P>
<B>Results</B>
<P>
The project is well under way. Much of the battery, vehicle, and RFG characterization has been completed and submitted for external peer review. Argonne has prepared draft papers on the following topics: the selection of battery and electric vehicle types for inclusion in the assessment; EV performance characteristics, EV battery recharging patterns, energy use and emissions associated with producing and recycling EV batteries, vehicle travel patterns in the four study areas and selection of driving cycles for simulation of electric and conventional vehicle performance, estimates of energy consumption of electric and conventional vehicles, conventional-vehicle operating emissions, emissions associated with production of RFG, and projections of annual EV sales and stock. 
<P>
Base-case utility dispatch for the four regions has been simulated, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has completed an analysis of EV impacts assuming unconstrained charging and peak-shift charging in selected seasons, but the analysis is not yet available for review. 
<P>
<P>
<B>Future Plans</B>
<P>
The final products of this study will include a technical report documenting the estimates of the emissions and residuals of the total energy cycle of EVs and comparable conventional vehicles. The TEMIS output will be made available in a spreadsheet format. A policy-oriented report will be developed outlining the policy and R&D implications of the EVTECA.
