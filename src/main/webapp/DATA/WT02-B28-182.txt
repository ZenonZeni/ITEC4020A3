<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Zero Estate Tax Plan</STRONG></FONT><P>

<STRONG>Providing for you, your family, and your community</STRONG><BR>
Conventional wisdom says, "Hold on to what you own as long as possible." Unfortunately, when
it comes to estate taxes, this philosophy could cost your family dearly.<P>
Do you have an estate plan? If so, will it provide benefits you can enjoy in retirement as
well as minimize your estate tax exposure? The following text outlines an innovative estate
planning technique that provides value-added benefits to you and your spouse while alive and
helps take care of your family - and even your community - after you are gone.<P>

<STRONG>The Zero Estate Tax Plan</STRONG><BR>
The zero estate tax plan, when structured properly, will provide you and your spouse with a
lifetime income stream, reduce your current income taxes, and may potentially eliminate your
estate tax exposure. This strategy takes advantage of several tax benefits:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Charitable income tax deduction
<LI>Avoidance of long-term capital gains tax
<LI>Tax-free compounding of assets
<LI>Charitable estate tax deduction
<LI>Tax-free compounding of life insurance cash values
</UL>
To fully understand this strategy, let's examine the case of a hypothetical couple
approaching retirement. Their retirement objectives include visiting their children and
grandchildren, traveling, and becoming more involved in several of their favorite local
charities. Equally important, however, is the need to minimize their estate tax exposure. It
is extremely disheartening for them to know that up to 60% of their estate could go to the
federal government unless the proper steps are taken. In other words, the IRS - not their
family - could be the largest beneficiary of their estate.<P>

This couple has a fairly well diversified portfolio but a considerable portion of it is
illiquid real estate properties. To increase their liquidity and overall
financial security, they are contemplating selling the real estate portion of their
portfolio. However, this could create a significant tax liability.<P>
After assessing the couple's current financial situation, an estate planning professional and
the couple's attorney recommend the following estate plan.<P>

<IMG SRC="/nyl/images/pfepze2.gif" ALT="Chart" ALIGN=RIGHT  BORDER="0"> 
<p>

<STRONG>Step 1: Charitable Remainder Trust</STRONG><BR>
The first step involves the transfer of ownership of the couple's real estate holdings into a
tax-exempt charitable remainder trust. The charitable remainder trust converts a highly
appreciated or low yielding asset (often closely-held stock or real estate) into a lifetime
income stream. Here's how it works: The asset in the trust, in this case real estate (which
must be free from any indebtedness), is sold at a fair market value with the proceeds
reinvested in income-producing assets. Because of the trust's tax-exempt status, the
appreciation from the sale is not subject to capital gains tax. <P>
The trust, in turn, pays the couple a lifetime income stream to supplement their retirement.
Additionally, the contribution to the trust qualifies for a partial income tax charitable
deduction, subject to IRS rules, thereby reducing the couple's current income tax bill (This
calculation is based on actuarial assumptions to determine the charitable remainderman's
split interest at the end of the income beneficiary's life expectancy. At death, any
remaining assets in the trust will pass to the charities of their choice). The tax savings
and new income stream will improve this couple's retirement cash flow.<P>

<STRONG>Step 2: Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust</STRONG><BR>
Next, the couple establishes an irrevocable life insurance trust. This accomplishes two
goals: 1) Provides heirs with estate tax-free benefits upon death by using life insurance to
fund the trust; 2) Purchases a sufficient amount of life insurance to replace the value of
the asset transferred to the charitable remainder trust by utilizing the savings resulting
from the charitable income tax deduction with a portion of the income stream. So, the heirs
are made "whole."<P>
In this instance, the trust purchases survivorship whole life insurance or "second-to-die"
insurance. Survivorship whole life insurance covers the lives of  two individuals in one
insurance policy and pays the death benefit after the death of the second insured. As a
result, the cost is more affordable than purchasing two separate life insurance policies. In
addition to avoiding estate taxes, the proceeds will also avoid probate expenses since the
assets pass under the terms of the trust.<P>

<STRONG>Step 3: Unified Tax Credit</STRONG><BR>
The unified tax credit allows each spouse to give $600,000 to anyone they choose, whenever
they choose, gift and estate tax-free. The unified gift and estate tax credit of $192,800 is
equal to an exemption of $600,000. By gifting money and property to their children and
grandchildren while they are alive, the income and the appreciation of the gifted assets is
not part of their estate when they die. As a result of utilizing the unified 
tax credit, the couple can decrease the value of their estate by $1.2 million and save their
heirs close to $400,000 in estate taxes.<P>

<p>

<STRONG>A Win-Win Situation</STRONG><BR>
As you can see, a properly structured zero estate tax plan can benefit everyone - you, your
spouse, children, and charity.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Transferring a highly appreciated or low yielding asset into a charitable remainder trust
creates an income and avoids any capital gains tax. In addition, the charitable income tax
deduction reduces your current income taxes.
<LI>The irrevocable life insurance trust replaces the value of the asset gifted to charity
and your beneficiaries receive more than if you were to sell the asset and pay capital gains
and estate taxes. The life insurance proceeds are generally free from income and estate
taxes.
<LI>The unified tax credit provides an effective means of redistributing your wealth while
further reducing your estate tax exposure.
<LI>Finally, you will be able to give one or more charities a significant gift.
