<p>On a brilliant sunny morning in June, most of the GTS Duratek employees in the Columbia, Maryland, office just got up and walked out.  Was it mutiny? . . .  sick day en masse? . . . not even close.  There was something pretty special going on about a mile down the road and not one of them wanted to miss it.  When they arrived, there were already a lot of people there: reporters, photographers, caterers, and state / county officials.  Robert E. Prince, GTS Duratek's president and CEO, was excited _ and not only because of what was about to happen.  (As you read on in this issue, you'll find out what Bob was looking forward to that evening.)<br>
<p>This was the day that GTS Duratek had been dreaming about for a long time.  This was the day that it was to break ground for the new corporate headquarters _ a $3.3 million facility, featuring a striking two-story glass entrance.  A big smile was on the face of every person who stood at the podium to deliver praises to GTS Duratek; Manekin Corporation, the builder; and Howard County / Maryland State governments.  The speakers included Cole Schnorf, senior vice president, development, Manekin; Richard Alter, president and CEO, Manekin; James Brady, secretary, Maryland State Department of Business and Economic Development; Beverly Wilhide, assistant to the county executive, Chuck Ecker; Richard Story, executive director, Howard County Economic Development Authority; and Robert Prince, president and CEO, GTS Duratek.<br>
<p>GTS Duratek has been at the Guilford Road location for six years.  It has since expanded into what used to be storage space and coworkers are trying ever so hard to smile and be polite as they step over each other in the hallways and hold meetings in the lunch room or even at their desks due to the insufficient number of conference rooms.  This will be but a fond memory in December 1996, when they move into the spacious two-story, 35,000-square-foot facility.  The new building will not only house the corporate offices, but will provide space for materials warehousing, pilot-scale melter testing, and ion exchange media production.<br>
<p>GTS Duratek will lease from Manekin, but does have an option to buy the building at a later date.  Plans include space for an additional 22,000-square-foot future expansion.

<P>The Los Alamos office of GTS Duratek is providing technical and physical support for the Low-Level Mixed Waste Work Off Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico.  The objective of the project is to ship wastes off site for treatment and disposal rather than treating waste at LANL.  The GTS Duratek team support includes performing historical reviews, sampling and repackaging mixed waste, analyzing analytical data, and profiling the mixed waste for treatment and disposal at potential commercial and U.S. Department of Energy treatment/disposal facilities.  The results of the low-level mixed waste work off project have been excellent, with four successful off-site shipments completed in FY’96 and five more planned for later on this fiscal year.

<P>GTS Duratek has been involved in extensive systems testing since it was given the green light to begin operations at its Vendor Treatment Facility (VTF) at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Savannah River Site (SRS) in April.  During the testing phase, GTS Duratek made the decision to enhance the system, which will extend the startup period, to ensure that it will be ready to run safely and efficiently for a long period of time.  The DuraMelter 5000, the centerpiece of the Company’s vitrification system at the VTF, is a prototype for the melter to be built at the Hanford Tank Waste Cleanup in Richland, Washington, and is roughly one-third its size.  The design changes being made now will further GTS Duratek’s knowledge for that important contract, due to be awarded in the fall of this year.  Once systems testing is complete, radioactive operations will begin.  The first batch of actual waste to be processed has been transferred to the chemical feed addition tank.<BR>
<P>Vitrification Day was held at SRS on May 29.  The media was given a tour of the VTF.  A brief presentation was made by Robert E. Prince, president and CEO, GTS Duratek.  Also in May, the GTS Duratek crew held its First Annual Family Day.  Bob Prince traveled to the site to personally thank everyone for their dedication and hard work on site and congratulate them on their success.
When all is said and done at M-Area, it won’t spell the end for the VTF.  The waste that will be processed at M-Area represents only one percent of the waste that is at SRS, and GTS Duratek is negotiating with Westinghouse Savannah River Company — who maintains and operates SRS — to send other waste streams to the VTF once this project is finished. <BR><BR>

<P>Things are heating up at the Fernald Environmental Management Project, located outside of Cincinnati, Ohio.  The DuraMelter 1000-HT is now up and running.  This is GTS Duratek’s largest high-temperature melter, capable of producing up to three tons of glass per day.  It is designed to operate at 1350oC, 200oC above other DuraMelters.  Besides supplying Fernald Environmental Restoration Management Company (FERMCO) with the DuraMelter      1000-HT, GTS Duratek also supplied a gem machine that is capable of cutting the glass stream from the melter into "gems" (flattened marbles) and conveying the gems into designated drums.  "DuraGems" were chosen because of their easy handling characteristics.<BR>
<P>The Construction Acceptance Tests were successfully completed on both the melter and gem machine in late April.  Bakeout of the melter (the process of taking the melter from room temperature to its operating temperature and full of glass) commenced on May 18.  This process took about three weeks and a total of about 6,000 pounds of glass was added to the melter.  Integrated testing of the melter and support systems (feed and off-gas systems and the gem machine) began following bakeout.  The GTS Duratek staff and representatives from The Catholic University of America’s Vitreous State Laboratory (VSL), the Company’s partner, assisted FERMCO through their Campaign 1 Systems Operability Test (SOT).  Throughout this test, FERMCO successfully processed runs of 20% and 40% slurry-fed solids, which produced several hundred pounds of DuraGems.  The SOT for Campaign 1 was completed on July 29.  At present, GTS Duratek is preparing to support FERMCO through Campaign 2 which will encompass a 36-hour Melter Acceptance Test and an 8-hour Gem Machine Acceptance Test.  These tests are currently anticipated to begin in mid to late August.<BR>
<P>The GTS Duratek support crew will remain assembled at Fernald through the end of September, and the VSL will supply scientific coverage through that period as necessary.

<P><I>By Angela Roe</I><BR>

<P>GTS Duratek’s president and CEO, Robert E. Prince, was honored as Entrepreneur of the Year for Maryland’s Technology category at an awards dinner on June 26 — the same day as the ground breaking for the new headquarters.  What a day!  <BR>
<P>Bob Prince won the award based on his achievements in bringing Duratek Corporation and General Technical Services together and creating a company " . . . on the cutting edge of providing an effective solution to one of our most pressing environmental [waste] problems."<BR>
<P>Robert F. Shawver, executive vice president and CFO of GTS Duratek had this to say on behalf of all employees:  "The employees of GTS Duratek are all proud to be part of the success of GTS Duratek and its leader.  We look forward to following Bob’s leadership in achieving future successes for all of our clients and shareholders.  Through his example, Bob Prince has shown us all how to dream and achieve, and we congratulate him on this honor."<BR>
<P>What did Bob Prince have to say for himself?  He was, of course, modest.  "This award is not only for me, it’s for the whole company.  We’ve got an excellent team of people who work together to accomplish aggressive goals, and we get the job done.  The reason GTS Duratek is so successful is that we have the people part right."<BR>
<P>Entrepreneur of the Year is sponsored nationally by Ernst & Young LLP, the Entrepreneur of the Year Institute, the Center for Entrepreneur Leadership, Inc. at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, and the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Local sponsors were The Baltimore Sun, Piper & Marbury, and Sprint. <BR><BR>

<P>The DuraTherm Recycling Center returned to operations in May, following a major improvement and expansion program.  Since then, the facility and its staff have undergone and passed numerous formal environmental audits and site visits by representatives from major petroleum, petrochemical, and environmental companies.  This audit/approval process is an essential step for new customers when they first begin to use DuraTherm as part of their waste management programs.<BR>
<P>When choosing waste management vendors, these international companies impose a laundry list of stringent acceptance criteria before authorizing the vendors to process their waste.  Surprisingly, not all of the criteria are directly related to the vendor’s waste processing capability.  Some examples of the areas looked at include: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>	professional expertise,
<LI>	range of capabilities,
<LI>	community relations,
<LI>	parent company’s stability and reputation,
<LI>	financial strength,
<LI>	regulatory permits and compliance,
<LI>	industry acceptance, and
<LI>	physical condition of the vendor’s facility.
</UL><BR>
<p>So far, DuraTherm has a 100 percent approval record, and its staff looks forward to continuing improvements in production and revenue contribution throughout the rest of the year.
