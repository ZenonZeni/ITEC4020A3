<H3><center>Reflecting on the Mirror's Image</center></H3>
<p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My sophomore year in college, I checked my body image in the mirror every day.  What I saw did not please me.  It seemed that my body was growing wider at the hips.  I would frown at my reflection and worry about how to address the problem.  Unbeknownst to me, my roommate was experiencing the same thing.  She, too, would look in the mirror and gasp at the growing expanse of her hips.  One day we were both in the room dressing for some function.  We shut the door to check our appearances in the full length mirror.  Nancye exclaimed "Ricci, I just can't believe how big my hips are getting!"  I was standing near the door, with her behind me looking in the mirror.  I leaned against the door as I turned to face her and respond to her remark.  When I did I pushed the mirror flat with the door and what had appeared to be large hips was clarified to be distortion from a badly hung mirror!  We laughed and vowed never to reveal our insecurities to others.  Well, as you can read, I am now revealing our secret, but for a good reason!</BLOCKQUOTE><p>
Body image distortion is not only a function of badly hung mirrors, but also of badly ingrained social messages.  Pull out any magazine and look at the pictures the media tell us are ideal images of women's and men's bodies.  The women actually are some 15 to 25 pounds underweight, but the media puts them forth as the "real woman's woman."  In fact, most female models are more than 10% underweight and some 80% of female professional models have breast implants.  There is also the other extreme:  the eternal adolescent look.  Check out the latest model Kate Moss.  She is so underweight that you can count her ribs and her spine sticks out like a mountain ridge.  Yet, print media show Kate Moss in the latest jeans style, nude on top, and send the message that her body is what is desirable.  This is not only untrue...it is extremely dangerous.  As we grow, our bodies mature.  For men and women maturation means growing larger, filling out in the pectoral, hip, and thigh areas.  While this physical growth is valued in men, the media sends us messages (a la Kate Moss) that this maturation is not valued and should thus be thwarted.<p>  
Male body image is also being attacked and portrayed unrealistically in media.  How many male models do you see who are less than 6 feet tall?  However, the "average" male is less than 6 feel tall.  Also, media images show males with muscular arms, "wash board" type stomachs, with little  body hair, lots of head hair, and smooth complexions.  Realistically, men can have larger muscular development than women, however, most men are not as "pumped" as the media portrays as the ideal male.  Also, body hair is part of the maturation process.  However, many male models have electrolysis or waxing done to be portrayed as the elite macho image with adolescent hair features:  the best of both worlds in being physically developed and yet boyishly appealing.  Also, male models are more likely to use hair replacement methods for head hair than are non-model males.  Hair loss on the head is also part of the growth and maturation process, and yet you will not find it portrayed in most media.<p>
Body image reflections should be reevaluated.  Don't critique yourself based on what the media says is ideal.  Critique yourself based on how you feel, how you think you look in your own right, and how well your physical structure serves your needs.  Realize that models are not "normal" nor ideal.  Rather, models are paid high sums to keep their bodies in unrealistic and unhealthy proportions.  Maybe you should check out how real people look in real pictures and in real situations.  Pay more attention to what the people around you look like.  Also, talk to those around you and challenge them to be more realistic in their critique of body image.  Don't succumb to social distortions of body image.<p>

<p>
The perfect weight for you cannot be determined by a schedule or chart.  Each of us has some idiosyncrasy that makes our bodies unique.  Our bone structures differ, as do our genetic compositions, activity levels, and metabolic rates.  Too much attention is given to what a scale says, and too little attention is given to what our bodies are saying.  Take a moment to inventory your body and listen to what your body is saying.  Does your body have energy?  How does your hair look?  Are your nails brittle?  How is your skin tone?  How are your teeth and gums?  Keep going.  Now think about how you can help integrate all of your body's messages to work toward maintaining a healthy body.<p>
Most health experts do recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise 3 times per week.  Moderate exercise includes walking, light aerobics, jogging, team sports, cycling, etc.  This exercise is not geared to help you lose weight, but to keep muscles strong, the heart in good condition, and to maintain a regular metabolism.<p>  
Health experts also generally recommend that we limit cholesterol, sugar, and sodium intake.  That doesn't mean to cut out fried foods, soft drinks, and snacks, but to make healthy choices.  All individually packaged foods now have nutrition information on the labels.  Read carefully to determine what your favorite foods contain and how they are impacting your nutrition intake.<P>
Drink water.  Water is important in maintaining good skin tone, healthy hair, and in ridding our bodies of toxins.  Many health experts recommend at least 32 ounces of noncarbonated water per day.<p>
If, <U>and this is a huge if</U>, you want to lose weight, do it sensibly.  Crash diets, restricting  food intake, and bingeing and purging do not work.  Start with limiting noncontributory calories.  That means that if the food or drink does not provide you with necessary nutrition, think about limiting your amount of that food or drink.  For example, 20 ounces of Coca-Cola contains 250 calories, 87.5 milligrams of sodium, and 67.5 grams of sugar.  However, the drink provides no protein, vitamins, or minerals.  Likewise, 12 ounces of most light beers contain 96 to 110 calories and provide minimal nutrition.  Also think about what food items have more "filling" value.  One orange and 6 ounces of orange juice have similar amounts of calories, however, the orange itself has more fiber and is more filling than the glass of orange juice.<p>
Get the proper amount of sleep.  Some people do need less sleep than others, but at least 5 to 6 hours of sleep per night is recommended.  Inadequate restful sleep is a huge contributor to poor concentration, mood swings, and can lead to poor choices in nutrition and the use of alcohol and other drugs.  If you are well rested, you will not be as likely to seek out pseudo-relaxing behaviors such as binge drinking or substance abuse.  Also, proper rest will provide you with the energy you need to get work done in a limited time.
