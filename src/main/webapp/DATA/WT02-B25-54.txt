<p>You may know--or know of--someone who has a &quot;mental
illness,&quot; but you may <i>not</i> know what a &quot;mental
illness&quot; is.</p>

<p>A mental illness is, more accurately, a <i>brain disorder</i>;
and brain disorders--like epilepsy--are <i>biologically based</i>
medical problems. The newest medical technology can take
&quot;pictures&quot; that show differences between brains with disorders
and normal brains.</p>

<p>In any given year, about five million American adults suffer
from an acute episode of one of five serious brain disorders:
schizophrenia, manic depression, severe depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. Even many of
America's children--more than three million--suffer from these disorders.</p>

<p>Untreated, disorders of the brain profoundly disrupt a
person's ability to think, feel, and relate to others and to his
or her environment. Despite age-old myths and misinformation,
&quot;mental illnesses&quot; are not caused by bad character,
poor child-rearing, or an individual's behavior.</p>
<div align="right">

        misinformation, &quot;mental illnesses&quot; are not caused

        behavior.</p>

<p>Brain disorders are shrouded in stigma and discrimination. For
centuries they have been misunderstood, feared, hidden, and often
ignored by science. Only in the last few decades has the first real
hope for people with mental illnesses surfaced, and that hope has
grown from pioneering research that found both a biological basis
for brain disorders and treatments that work. </p>

<p>Brain disorders are treatable. The current success rate for
treating schizophrenia is 60 percent. The success rate for
treating manic depression is 65 percent, and for major depression
it is 80 percent. Mental illnesses can now be diagnosed and
treated as precisely and effectively as other medical disorders.
But the stigma--and the discrimination caused by that stigma--remains.</p>

<p>Yours may be one of the five families in the United States
that is or will be directly affected by a serious brain disorder.
Such families face an unfair system that still treats them as
&quot;less than,&quot; &quot;not as important as,&quot; or
&quot;not equal to&quot; the rest of Americans. <i>All</i>
Americans must help end the stigma and discrimination that linger
despite the scientific proof that makes them groundless.</p>

<p><font size="3">Discrimination against people with brain
disorders makes no sense. No scientific sense. No economic sense.
No political sense.</font></p>

<p>Stigma is an ancient evil. It still limits all aspects of life
for people with brain disorders: housing, education, insurance,
science, research, services, jobs, religion, and personal
relationships. </p>

<p>Stigma is everywhere, but NAMI--the family organization for
people with brain disorders--intends to end it. With its 140,000
members, NAMI has launched a five-year effort to challenge
negative stereotypes, educate the public, confront discrimination,
and demand fair public policies from informed elected officials and
policy-makers. </p>

<p>NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination will close the gaps
between science and policy. NAMI will demand equal access and
treatment for a group of people who have been denied their
inalienable rights simply because they have schizophrenia instead
of epilepsy, manic depression instead of Alzheimer's, or major
depression instead of Parkinson's disease.</p>
<div align="center"><center>

</center></div>

<p align="left">NAMI was started because families needed to come
together to change the widely held and wrong belief that they
were the cause of their loved one's mental illness. They worked
beside scientists and researchers to enlighten Americans, to
verify that disorders of the brain are biologically based and treatable.
NAMI now must teach Americans that it is no longer acceptable to treat
those with brain disorders any differently than they treat those
with diabetes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most immediate need of persons with brain
disorders is fair and equal access to appropriate health care.
When illness strikes any other organ of the body, insurance
covers treatment. When illness strikes the brain, full coverage
is very rarely available, and the illness becomes a crushing economic burden.
The prevalence rates of epilepsy and schizophrenia are almost the
same, but health insurers fully cover epilepsy and leave tens of thousands
of people with schizophrenia to rely on public assistance for
access to life-saving treatment. This is unfair discrimination.</p>

<p>Two major health insurance plans in the nation's capital are
typical. One requires members hospitalized with brain disorders
to pay a $150-a-day co-payment but requires no such payment for inpatient
care of other diseases. The other plan, offered by an HMO, caps
lifetime mental health benefits but not benefits for other
medical conditions. Such policies are not justified.</p>

<p>&quot;Persons with poor mental health insurance coverage run
out of insurance; they don't run out of illness,&quot; says NAMI
Executive Director Laurie Flynn. &quot;With proper care, many
could go back to work and become productive taxpayers.&quot;</p>
