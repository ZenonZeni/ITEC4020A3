MoSys To Ship Multibank DRAM 01/03/96

MoSys To Ship Multibank DRAM 01/03/96
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- MoSys Inc. is set to
begin shipment of its Multibank dynamic random access memory (MDRAM)
product. The MDRAM is an extended-performance synchronous DRAM with
high bandwidth, short access times, and, according to the company,
"unique pricing."

Speaking to Newsbytes, Gary Banta, vice president of marketing for
MoSys, said: "The MDRAM is the highest performance DRAM architecture
available on the market today. Its peak bandwidth exceeds the nearest
competitive product by nearly one-third."

He continued: "First, we achieve access times on 20 nanoseconds (ns)
compared to all other DRAMs between 70 and 100 nanoseconds. Second we
not only start and stop faster, our top speed is faster, operating at
over 600 kilobytes per second. SDRAM (synchronous DRAM), for example,
operates at around 200 kilobytes per second."

MoSys claims that it employs an independent multibank organization
that is unique from any other DRAM product. This organization allows
independent operations to access different banks independently.
Because of the independent multibank system, it is no longer necessary
to use memory in predefined one megabyte (MB), 2MB, or 4MB increments,
according to the company.

Starting from 0.5MB, the MDRAM is available in 0.25MB increments. For
example, this allows 1,024 by 768 "True Color" applications, which require
2.25MB for frame buffer, to be implemented with exactly the correct amount
of memory, says the company.

Banta claims that the cost savings to the end-user is significant, saying:
"Before, if you needed a 2.25MB DRAM, you had to buy up to a 4MB product.
Buying a 2.25MB MDRAM saves the cost of the excess 1.75MB."

"While DRAM process technology affords a lot of opportunity to excel,
traditional DRAM market leaders have been reluctant to innovate in
other than standard DRAMs," said Dr. Yong Yao, senior analyst at
MicroDesign Resources. "However, standard DRAMs are bottlenecks for
many emerging applications, such as multimedia and others requiring
ultra-high performance PC graphics. Thus, market dominance by the
conventional 'dinosaurs' in DRAM technology is going to be challenged
and there clearly is an opportunity for a company like MoSys, with its
MDRAM, to be a significant player in the high-performance memory arena."

Ralph O. Cognac, vice president of business development for MoSys,
said: "This marks an important milestone in the company. With our
manufacturing partnerships in place and demand growing rapidly
after our award-winning demonstrations at Comdex, we are now
prepared to become a major player in the specialty DRAM market."

Cognac also commented that, while MoSys has received MDRAM inquiries
from a wide variety of companies from diverse application areas -- such
as high-definition television, set-top box converters, hyper-reality
games, and networking -- the closest-to-production applications
continue to be those in the PC graphics arena.

The MDRAM initially will be available in five configurations, at both
100 megahertz (MHz) and 125MHz clock speeds, with capacities that range
from 0.5MB to 1.25MB. The product is available in both 68-pin plastic
leadless chip carriers (PLCC), and 128-pin 14 by 20 by 2.7 millimeter
(mm) plastic quad flat pack (PQFP). Available immediately is the 1MB
MDRAM in 10 thousand units at $40 each, and the 1.125MB MDRAM in 10
thousand units at $45 each. Others will be available in the first
quarter, 1996.

Ericsson Secures Further Mobitex Order In Singapore 01/03/96

Ericsson Secures Further Mobitex Order In Singapore 01/03/96
STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Ericsson has secured another
major order for its Mobitex radio packet data network (PDN) in
Singapore. This time the company has contracted with the TIBS taxi
fleet, which covers the colony with 800 vehicles, to install a Mobitex
system for use by drivers, customers, and staff of the company.

According to Ericsson, using the system, customers can dial the taxi
company and, following audiotex menus, can press buttons on their
phones to order their cab.

The task is not as complex as it sounds, as TIBS has set up accounts
for its regular users, who are then offered a choice of their five
most regular pickup points. Users key in their account number and
personal identification number (PIN) to get this menu, and then receive
a confirmation of the order, together with an estimated time of arrival.
If they stay on the line, they are told which taxi driver will be
meeting with them, and, if the order if an immediate one, where that
driver is currently, together with an estimated wait time.

Ericsson claims that the Mobitex system being installed for TIBS will
allow the company to handle up to 1,000 bookings an hour, compared
with a manual system that could handle a maximum of 120 bookings an
hour previously.

The contract means that there are now 16 public Mobitex networks
operating in 15 countries. Although the radio PDN service is designed
for many different applications, Ericsson claims that the technology
is rapidly gaining a foothold in the transportation business, as well
as in field service and public safety organizations.

Motorola Claims Chinese Handwriting Breakthrough 01/03/96

Motorola Claims Chinese Handwriting Breakthrough 01/03/96
LONDON, ENGLAND, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Motorola's Lexicus Division has
unveiled a Windows 95 handwriting recognition package for the Chinese
alphabet. According to officials with Lexicus, using the package,
writers will now be able to accurately input the 13,000 Chinese
characters into Windows 95 applications on standard desktop or
notebook computers.

Known as the Lexicus Recognizer, the software is claimed to be a
"highly effective solution" with over 95 percent accuracy ratios
in "real usage situations."

The package, which will ship in the first quarter of 1996 at a price
to be announced, comes with two dictionaries containing the whole
Chinese character set (over 13,000 characters), and can be run on an
80486-based PC or better.

According to Motorola, the large number of Chinese characters is very
difficult to recognize for most users, and additional variances in
personal writing makes the procedure more complicated. Lexicus,
claims the company, can "easily cope" with these differences, making out
"cursive" style characters and so being able to handle faster and "more
natural" handwriting.

Motorola officials explained to Newsbytes that there is an additional
problem -- European keyboards are different for those designed for
use in China and other Asian countries. Lexicus can cope with even the
most basic of European keyboards, it is claimed.

According to Elton Sherwin, vice president of marketing with Lexicus,
"This technology will revolutionize the use of PCs and microprocessors
in Asia. Users no longer need to learn the English keyboard to enter
Chinese characters into PCs, PDAs (personal digital assistants), and
notebook computers. By the turn of the century this technology may run
on the surface of a watch crystal," he claimed.

Newsbytes notes that there are more than a billion writers of the
Chinese alphabet in the world. They uses one of two character sets --
traditional or simplified. The Traditional character set is in use in
Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Simplified, meanwhile, was developed in the Peoples Republic of China
and combines traditional characters with some simplified versions of
characters. Japanese Kanji letters have a considerable overlap with
traditional and, to a lesser extent, simplified Chinese characters.

Lexicus was acquired by Motorola in the fourth quarter of 1993, from
its founders, a private development company. At the time, industry
experts noted that handwriting recognition had had only a limited
technological and market success, but was seen as a key to the
potentially lucrative market for hand-held devices. Lexicus was
acquired and added to Motorola's Paging and Wireless Data Division.

Asia Newsbriefs 01/03/96

Asia Newsbriefs 01/03/96
TOKYO, JAPAN, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- In this roundup of news from across
Asia: Korea - Foreigners to invest in telecom companies; Indonesia -
Mitsui to launch pager service; Singapore - Telecom violations down;
India, Malaysia - Casio expands Asian production.

Korea - Foreigners To Invest In Telecom Companies

The Korean government has said foreigners or foreign companies will be
able to hold equity stakes of up to 33% in Korean telecommunication
companies from 1998. At the same time, restrictions will be lifted on
the number of foreign board members at companies, presently pegged at
one third, and the way will also be cleared for foreigners to manage
telecommunications projects. Further afield, in 2001, the government
will allow foreigners to operate telecommunications services in Korea
by leasing lines and capacity from Korean operators. Restrictions will
continue that ban foreigners from becoming majority stakeholders in
telecommunications projects.

Indonesia - Mitsui To Launch Pager Service

Japan's Mitsui & Co. Ltd. trading house will launch a pager service in
Indonesia this year. The company will jointly establish P.T. Buana
Bintangbayu with Jakata-based telecommunications company P.T.
Telekomindo Primabhakti. From the middle of January the service will
be made available in Jakata and slowly expand to other major cities in
the country. Mitsui & Co. will hold 25% of the company which will send
its signals via the Indosat satellite.

Singapore - Telecom Violations Down

Singapore's Business Times newspaper has reported the number of
violations of the telecoms laws fell in the April to September period
last year. Singapore Telecom found 19 infringements in the course of
1,327 inspections carried out during the period. In the previous six
months it conducted 1,057 inspections and discovered 52 violations.
The infringements range from selling equipment without a dealer's
license to selling equipment for local use without the correct
approval labels. Of the 19 regulation breakers, sixteen were
prosecuted, reported the newspaper.

India, Malaysia - Casio Expands Asian Production

Japan's Casio Computer is to begin manufacturing and selling pagers in
India from February. The company will establish Casio Bharti Mobile
Communications Ltd. and hold 51% of the stock, with India's Bharti
Telecom holding 40%, and Japanese trading company Mitsui & Co. Ltd.
holding the remaining 9%. Reports put first year sales targets at
26,000, but eventual manufacturing is hoped to reach 600,000 pagers
annually. The announcement came a few days after Casio said it would
begin manufacture of digital cameras in Malaysia. Production will
begin in April with full production of 70,000 units a month of the
QV-10 digital camera due on stream in the summer.

Japan Newsbriefs 01/03/96

Japan Newsbriefs 01/03/96
TOKYO, JAPAN, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- In this roundup of news from Japan:
Hashimoto ponders for NTT, KDD merger; NTT DoCoMo profits to surge;
Star TV plans Japanese channel; Short holidays at chip makers; Sanyo
shifting production; Ziff purchase to be partly funded by bonds issue;
Sony to enter video CD software market.

Hashimoto Ponders For NTT, KDD Merger

Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has proposed the idea of a
merger between Nippon Telegraph & Telephone (NTT) and Kokusai Denshin
Denwa (KDD). NTT is the world's largest telephone company and
dominates the domestic telephone market in Japan, while KDD holds a
similar dominant position in the international telephone market.
Hashimoto, who is also president of the Liberal Democratic Party,
was speaking on a TV Asahi talk program. He called for further
deregulation of the Japanese telecommunications market and the joining
together of the two companies to maintain a strong position in the
face of competition from overseas telephone companies.

NTT DoCoMo Profits To Surge

Profits at the nine companies of the NTT DoCoMo network are set to
surge 36% in fiscal year 1995 to 1.1 trillion yen ($11 billion),
companies officials have said. In the eight months to September, 1995,
the companies attracted 1.48 million new subscribers, underlining the
strong growth in the sector that is leading to the profits jump.

Star TV Plans Japanese Channel

Hong Kong-based Star TV, Asia's top satellite television network, will
start a new channel for the Japanese market, according to sources
quoted by the Kyodo news service. Star TV, owned by media tycoon
Rupert Murdoch, gained permission from the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications to beam programs to Japan in early 1995. The new
channel will be offered via cable and in some hotels, but not initially
via direct-to-home satellite reception. The reports suggested the
channel will begin broadcasting in April this year. Other broadcasters
planning to enter the Japanese market include Turner's TNT & Cartoon
Network and CNBC Asia. CNN International and BBC World are already
available on Japanese cable, as is a local version of MTV.

Short Holidays At Chip Makers

Workers at Japan's semiconductor manufacturers could only enjoy short
holidays this new year because of the strong demand for products.
Units of NEC Corporation reported holidays of just three days from
January 1. Other manufacturers have also cut holidays from an originally
planned six or seven days to just three. In the summer, the same
companies also cut holidays to cope with the strong demand for
computer chips.

Sanyo Shifting Production

Consumers buying Sanyo video cassette recorders will soon be unable to
find any carrying the "made in Japan" impression, according to a report
in the Yomiuri Shimbun. The newspaper said the company is looking to
move all VCR production to plants overseas to better insure against
losses due to the strong yen. Of the 3.3 million machines Sanyo makes
each year, 600,000 are produced at a plant in Osaka. The remainder are
turned out from factories in Indonesia, China, and Germany.

Ziff Purchase To Be Partly Funded By Bonds Issue

Softbank Corporation announced just after Christmas that it intends to
fund its purchase of Ziff Davis Publishing through the issue of 70
billion yen ($700 million) worth of bonds. The company agreed to
purchase Ziff Davis Publishing for $1.8 billion and has already issued
new stock and raised around 63 billion yen ($630 million).

Sony To Enter Video CD Software Market

Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan) Inc. will begin producing software
for the Video CD format in March. The company announced it will
release ten titles, including Stand By Me, Easy Rider, Taxi Driver,
The Adams Family, Kramer vs Kramer, Ghostbusters, Last Action Hero,
No Way Out, Silence of the Lambs, and Robocop. The Video CD format is
based on the CD platform and supports MPEG-1 (Motion Picture Experts
Group type 1) video compression. It is already widely used in Karaoke
machines and several manufacturers offer combined VHS/Video CD player
machines in Japan.

 ****European Cross-Border Decency Laws In Spotlight 01/03/96

 ****European Cross-Border Decency Laws In Spotlight 01/03/96
TOKYO, JAPAN, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- The decision by Compuserve to remove
20 Usenet newsgroups after complaints from German legislators is
not the first time cross-border decency and obscenity has reared its
head in Europe. The British government has already experienced the
problems universal access can cause in the satellite television sector
and other nations have been angered by cross-border broadcasting.

From the late 1980s, widespread access to broadcasts from other
European countries has become more common as small, cheap satellite
dishes have appeared on millions of European rooftops to pull in, not
just more local programming, but transmissions from other countries.

In the UK, the most well-known example of such problems involved Red
Hot Television, a late night hard core porn channel that was based in
Denmark and broadcasting to viewers across Europe.

Such programming was well in excess of British decency standards but,
the channel argued, it was legally broadcasting to the UK because the
material was within the laws of its country of origin, Denmark. Under
the European Community's "Television Without Frontiers" directive,
broadcasts were deemed acceptable community wide if they met the
requirements of the state from which they emanated from.

After much study of the laws, and consultation with the European
Community, the British government decided a clause in the directive,
allowing broadcasts to be proscribed if they threatened to corrupt the
moral values of the country, applied, and the channel was successfully
banned from the UK market. Steep fines and possible jail awaited
anyone caught selling subscriptions.

Other countries have also faced problems caused by cross-border
broadcasting. In 1989, the Dutch authorities told cable networks they
could not carry TV10, a Dutch language channel based in Luxembourg.
The channel located there because of problems obtaining a commercial
broadcasting license in the Netherlands. TV10 never launched after it
was banned from its intended audience and later appealed to the
European Court, only to be ruled against.

Last year, neighboring Belgium attempted to ban a Scandinavian-based
Flemish language channel, VT4. The station located outside of Belgium
because the country would only allow one commercial broadcaster. On
this occasion, the broadcaster won, due to the country having no
restrictions on foreign broadcasters.

The French too have also been angered by foreign channels -- this
time Ted Turner's TNT & Cartoon Network which broadcasts from London.
France said there was not enough French language content to comply
with French cultural laws and threatened to pull the channel from
cable networks nationwide. Turner added French audio channels and
subtitles and the situation was resolved.

Back in the UK, sex is again in the news as the country recently
blocked access to TV Erotica. However, pornography has not been
the only thing to upset the British. Several years ago, cable
operators were cautioned over Galavision, a Mexican TV broadcaster,
because of its screening of bull fighting.

Ironically, British-based broadcasters have also caused problems
overseas. TV3 is a network of three channels broadcasting to Sweden,
Denmark, and Norway, and established itself in London to escape strict
Scandinavian commercial laws.

The laws ban advertising for all alcoholic drinks and products,
something which the UK allows. Despite requests from the Scandinavian
authorities, the UK government cited the cross-border broadcasting laws
and TV3's legality under UK laws as the reason for its refusal to take
action.

European media chiefs and the European Union are currently in
consultation over a more comprehensive and accepted replacement to the
"Television Without Frontiers" directive. Such a directive is likely
to be closely followed by online regulators seeking to ensure common,
unrestricted access to information and services across the entire
European Union, one of the major cornerstones of the union.

Final Stuff Technology Claims Against Storagetek Dismissed 01/03/96

Final Stuff Technology Claims Against Storagetek Dismissed 01/03/96
LOUISVILLE, COLORADO., U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- A judge has
dismissed the last two charges in a lawsuit that charged that Storage
Technology Corp. (NYSE: STK) had breached a 1990 agreement with
Stuff Technology Partners, a former development partner. Stuff had
sought $2.4 billion in its original suit.

The suit was originally filed in early 1994. Judge Morris Sandstead
Jr. dismissed 14 of the original 16 claims in June, 1995, ruling that
the General Mutual Release agreement signed by the two companies was
unambiguous. The release settled a dispute over rights to an optical
technology developed jointly by Storagetek and Stuff. Storagetek said
the two companies put about $68 million into the project, but no
product was ever brought to market.

The final two claims were based on a Stuff allegation that
Storagetek had breached the original 1990 agreement by developing
and/or manufacturing optical disk products and/or media. Storagetek
said the 1990 agreement allows both parties to use the technology --
Stuff in optical products and Storagetek in any non-optical application.

However, according to Storagetek spokesperson David Reid, that doesn't
matter because none of Storagetek's products use Stuff's technology.
Storagetek said affidavits signed by numerous Storagetek senior managers
and engineers prove that no such products have been developed or
manufactured since the release was signed.

At the time Stuff filed its suit, Storagetek spokesperson Judith
Hargrave, in an interview with Newsbytes, called the suit "frivolous."
Hargrave said the partnership raised about $40 million. The funds were
to be paid out to Storagetek as the technology was developed.

Storagetek said it is considering filing a claim to recover damages
on the grounds that the suit filed by Stuff was a violation of the
terms of the 1990 agreement between the two organizations.

New UK Nat'l Internet Service Provider 01/03/96

New UK Nat'l Internet Service Provider 01/03/96
WALSALL, WEST MIDLANDS, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Open Integration, a well-
known computer systems supplier, has set up a subsidiary operation to
offer Internet services. Known as Cyberphile, the Internet service
provider (SP) claims that, thanks to its parentage and a UKP500,000
investment in a fiber optic network spanning the UK, it can offer
"third-generation" Internet facilities to its customers.

Susan Perry, a spokesperson for the company, told Newsbytes that the
reference to the third generation is because the company is adopting a
"serious approach" to its provision of Internet services, offering
subscriptions ranging from simple dial-up monthly packages through to
leased line circuits with attendant consultancy and services such as
World Wide Web hosting.

"Because of our links with Open Integration, although we are a
separate company, we can provide businesses who need hardware support
a variety of options, including the leasing or rental of computer
hardware to run their Internet systems on," she claimed.

Cyberphile's headquarters is located in Walsall, in the West Midlands,
with the company claiming to have a 256,000 bits-per-second (bps) link
directly into the Internet backbone in the US. The company has
contracted with Energis, the National Power telecoms company, for
access to its virtual Points of Presence (vPOP) network across the UK,
which currently has around 80 percent local call access.

Because the Energis network is "virtual," all modem calls terminate at
Cyberphile's offices, where a bank of 28,800 bps Multitech modems link
into a series of Digital 64-bit Alpha servers that feed into the US
Internet backbone.

According to Perry, although there are now more than 80 Internet
service providers (SPs) operating in the UK, Cyberphile reckons there
is room in the market for another one, especially since only four other
Internet SPs have national local call coverage.

Sign-up to the Cyberphile service costs UKP19.99, with a monthly
subscription charge of UKP12.99. In return, subscribers get a fully
registered copy of Netscape, plus a suite of Internet applications
software for Windows. Plans are in hand to offer an Apple Macintosh
computer package for Mac subscribers, Perry told Newsbytes.

In addition to the basic service, the company is offering the Cybernet
toolbox Internet package, along with Cybersolve, an interactive
helpdesk utility. According to the company, Cybernet supports a fully
automated installation and configuration of the user's software,
allowing subscribers to be up and running in "a matter of minutes."

Cybersolve, meanwhile, is an interactive helpdesk application that
the company claims can be used either between Cyberphile and the
subscriber, or between a customer's in-house support team and the
members of staff on the Net. The package is billed as being "invaluable"
in an academic environment where many students are using the Internet,
and in large companies where all staff use e-mail and other Internet
facilities. In use, Cybersolve is billed as enabling the helpdesk to
take over the user's PC in order to solve problems remotely.

On the corporate front, Cyberphile claims to offers two services to
corporate subscribers which include the rental of Digital 75 megahertz
(MHz) Pentium PCs, 28,800bps BABT-approved modems, and Windows 95
preloaded. The advanced option includes 16 megabytes (MB) of memory
in place of the standard 8MB, along with Web page authoring and
Cybersolve software.

To encourage new subscribers to the fledgling service, Cyberphile is
offering half-price starter packs and the first month's subscription
free of charge. According to Mike Hurney, Cyberphile's managing
director, the Internet SP is among the top four SPs from day one of
its operation in terms of coverage, service, and training.

"We aim to be number one with subscribers and once there we'll stay
there. We have invested more, we charge less, and subscribers are
going to be very happy with our unique level of service. Many of our
competitors still offer services based around 2,400bps modems and
render additional charges based on elapsed connection time," he said.

Hurney went on to say that he views this as very much first-generation
Internet. Cyberphile, on the other hand, he claims, "represents the
birth of the third generation."

To get new users online to the Internet, Cyberphile is offering
subscribers free seminars on most weekday evenings so that aspiring
corporate, academic, or general public "surf slaves" need simply turn
up to become tuned in.

Further details of Cyberphile can be found on the company's Web pages,
which are located at http://www.cyberphile.co.uk .

Telecom Ireland Links To Internet Backbone Via MCI 01/03/96

Telecom Ireland Links To Internet Backbone Via MCI 01/03/96
DUBLIN, IRELAND, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Telecom Ireland has contracted with
MCI to take a two megabits-per-second (Mbps) link from Telecom Ireland's
headquarters in Dublin to MCI's Internet backbone in the US. According
to David Hughes, a spokesperson for Telecom Ireland, the link will
mean that more than 40 percent of all Internet traffic from Ireland
travels over MCI's 45Mbps and 155Mbps backbone lines in the US.

According to Hughes, Internet service providers (SPs) to date in
Ireland have been offering relatively localized Internet SP services
concentrated on the Dublin area, with some regional points of presence
(POPs) in other Irish cities.

"These SPs have then been taking a 64,000 bits-per-second (bps) or
128,000 bps leased line (from Ireland) into the UK or France, via services
such as Pipex and France Telecom. The problem with this approach is that a
64,000 bps leased line costs around the IRP (Irish Punts) 80,000 mark,
once all the costs have been added in," he said.

"This means that those smaller Internet SPs have had to concentrate as
much traffic as possible into the limited capacity leased lines in
order to get a return on their investment that can be charged at
normal Internet rates in the Irish Republic. There have been reports
of congestion on some Internet SPs' services," he said.

"What our initiative with MCI means is that the cost of a 64,000 bps
link through ourselves into the MCI US network is around the IRP
40,000 mark a year, which is around half of the competition. Since
we're not in the market for end-user Internet services, we plan to
offer slices of the 2Mbps link to Internet SPs in Ireland," he added.

Hughes claims that Telecom Ireland's deal with MCI on the Internet
front will see a downward pressure on Internet pricing in Ireland,
once the Internet SPs take advantage of the lower commercial rates of
the MCI link. This, he said, has to be good news for the Internet user
community, who will see the cost of their services fall, along with
congestion on the Internet, from their perspective.

MCI, meanwhile, is also providing a 512 kilobits-per-second (Kbps)
connection into the internetMCI backbone for Ireland's Higher Education
Authority. This link, the US telecoms giant claims, is being used by
colleges and universities in Ireland for Internet access.

According Margaret Malloy, vice president of marketing for Telecom
Ireland's US operation, the 2Mbps and 512Kbps links are critical
to the expansion of Internet service by Telecom Ireland. Plans are in
hand to extended Telecom Ireland's current nine POPs to 26, one for
exact local calling area in Ireland, with each POP connected by a
frame relay backbone.

"Telecom Ireland now provides service to more than 75 percent of
Ireland's end-users with additional roll-out already underway," she
said. She added that Telecom Ireland will be the first provider in
Europe to offer country-wide Internet access for the cost of a local
telephone call.

According to Malloy, plans also for Telecom Ireland to provide private
line and ISDN (integrated services digital network) access to the
Internet during 1996. "These links ensure high-quality access to the
Internet both to domestic users in Ireland who are accessing the
Internet, and to World Wide Web users who access Web pages in Ireland,"
she said.

America Online Readies UK Rollout 01/03/96

America Online Readies UK Rollout 01/03/96
LONDON, ENGLAND, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- The UK will get its first taste of
America Online's European service later this month when the service is
officially launched to the media, prior to a formal public launch in
March, Newsbytes has learned. Although the plans are top secret prior to
a media launch in two weeks time, Newsbytes has discovered that UK pricing
has been set at UKP3.95 per month for up to five hours of access, and
extra hours billable at UKP1.85 each.

The rates are slightly under the "Internet in a box" service launched
last month by CompuServe UK, but the AOL UK service does not surcharge
users for non-metro access, nor are any extra charges levied for
daytime usage.

AOL has seemingly spurned the Sprint International packet data network
(PDN) option that it was expected to use for European access to its
online service. Instead, the network has secretly constructed UK
extensions to its AOLNet private PDN that operates in the US and
Canada.

The UK AOLNet offers local calling service to around 85 percent of the
UK's population at 28,800 bits-per-second (bps), and plans are in hand
to cover the whole of the UK on a local calling basis by this summer.

Interestingly, the UK AOLNet does not seem publicly available to
US/Canadian subscribers of AOL, who are being steered to AOL's
GlobalNet PDN service for international access to the online service,
at a cost of $6.00 per hour, over and above normal US/Canadian AOL
access charges.

Detailed examination of the AOL GlobalNet files published on AOL over
the Christmas period shows that the service its actually the SITA
Scitor private global PDN service that CompuServe also uses for
international access in out-of-the-way places. Unlike AOL, however,
CompuServe surcharges its subscribers $12.00 per hour for Scitor PDN
access, which is aimed at users of CompuServe in Eastern Europe and
parts of the Far East and South America that are "non metro."

This strategy appears to be to ensure that new subscribers to AOL's UK
service have the best data throughput, since fast Internet access --
at 28,800 bps -- will form the basis of AOL's UK offering to PC
Windows and Apple Mac users, once the service is formally launched in
March.

Like CompuServe, AOL is hosting its "UK service" on the US computer
service, and plans are in hand to host UK-specific information
services on specific areas of AOL closer to the March launch date.

The fact that AOL is rolling out international service via the Scitor
PDN, however, under its AOL GlobalNet banner, suggests that a pan-
European rollout, and a global rollout, of the online service cannot
be far behind the UK launch this March.

Newsbytes has tested the AOL GlobalNet (Scitor) PDN access for AOL, as
well as the AOLNet UK service, over the Christmas period using the
Windows and Apple Mac 2.6 versions of AOL's software, and can report
that the GlobalNet access works, albeit only at speeds of up to 14,400
bps from non-metro locations.

The AOLNet UK service, however, operates at 28,800 bps from most
locations and works at speeds comparable with the AOLNet PDN service
in the US and Canada. At peak times, however, Internet Web access is
relatively slow, although to be fair to AOL, this criticism can also
be levied at CompuServe.

Advertisements have now started appearing in the quality press in the
UK, offering PC Windows users with modems the change to try out the
AOL UK service free of charge for two months, on an unlimited basis,
provided they have a valid credit card. Representatives of AOL that
Newsbytes spoke with at the UK toll-free hotline said that take-up of
the ads has been "excellent."

China - Large-Scale Production Of Windows 95 Starts 01/03/96

China - Large-Scale Production Of Windows 95 Starts 01/03/96
BEIJING, CHINA, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- The Chinese version of Windows 95 has
been put into large-scale production in Shanghai. The Chinese version
will follow the standard Chinese fonts and input methods recommended by
the Chinese Committee on Information Technology Standards (CCITS).

All the development and testing of the Simplified Chinese version of
Windows 95 has been completed and the production has started at a joint
venture with Microsoft in the Pudong New Development Area of Shanghai,
said Jia-bin Duh, general manager of the Microsoft representative office
in China.

The new software will follow the standards recommended by CCITS, which
is China's highest body for language standardization in the computer
field. In return, the Ministry of the Electronics Industry and Chinese
State Bureau of Technology Supervision agreed to endorse Chinese
Windows 95 as a "preferred product" and recommend it to domestic users.

Microsoft's list of new products to be introduced to Chinese users in
1996 will also include Microsoft Office 95, and Chinese versions of
Windows NT and Fox Pro, according to Duh.

The Chinese version of Windows 95 is expected to attract many customers
from the Chinese mainland, and the software should find huge markets
in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, the United States, and Canada, where
there are big Chinese communities, software experts said.

In China, Microsoft invested more than US$2 million in 1995, and its
registered sales showed a 100 percent growth in 1995. The software giant
will also set up more branches in Shanghai and Guangzhou in 1996.

China - Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom Project Founded 01/03/96

China - Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom Project Founded 01/03/96
BEIJING, CHINA, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- An Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom project
has recently been founded by six entities from China and Singapore with
the intention of providing mobile phone services to any place in the
Asia-Pacific region.

The project was founded by four Chinese government organizations and
two Singapore partners: China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control
General, China Aerospace Corp., China Unicom Satellite Telecom Co. Ltd.,
China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp., Singapore Telecom,
and Singapore Technologies Telemedia.

With an estimated cost from US$500 million to US$800 million, the
project intends to allow mobile phone users to make calls from anywhere
in the Asia-Pacific region. The project is to start operation in 1998,
providing "seamless" phone usage from Pakistan to Japan and covering
almost half of the world's population.

The services are aimed not only at residents in rural areas, but also
at business travelers working on infrastructure projects in remote
areas without telephone facilities.

Philippines - National Telecoms Commission Plans Growth 01/03/96

Philippines - National Telecoms Commission Plans Growth 01/03/96
MANILA, PHILIPPINES, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- A recent report released by the
National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) projects that, three years
from now, there will be ten phones for every one hundred Filipinos, and
seven million main lines throughout the Philippines. There are presently
1.9 million main lines in the country, according to the NTC report.

To meet the demand for basic telephone service, the NTC is currently
"leveling off" the telecommunications playing field so that "all service
providers may compete in an atmosphere of equal opportunity and
universal access," claims the commission. This is in accordance with
President Fidel V. Ramos' Executive Order (EO) 109, a policy to improve
the provision of local exchange service (LES).

The NTC claims that the government policy is unique in that "lucrative
telecommunications services such as the Cellular Mobile Telephone System
and the International Gateway Facility are being used to cross-subsidize
the less profitable but equally essential local exchange service."

EO 109 requires a minimum installation of 400,000 local exchange
lines for each cellular operator, and a minimum of 300, 000 local
exchange lines for each IGF operator within three years from the date
of authority to operate and maintain LES, the NTC report explains.

The NTC report also bared the "flagship" programs of the commission
for 1996, which includes the provision of "universal access" of basic
telephone services to rural areas, and the intensification of "enforcement
and monitoring activities" to clear the radio frequency spectrum to
encourage new telecommunications services and more investments in
the industry.

The NTC vision is that, after three years, applications for telephone
connections anywhere in the Philippines will be served within "ten
days and not ten years."

Printer Sales In Asia-Pacific Unaffected By EDI 01/03/96

Printer Sales In Asia-Pacific Unaffected By EDI 01/03/96
MANILA, PHILIPPINES, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Printer sales in the
Asia-Pacific region do not exhibit any signs of being affected by the
move towards a "paperless office concept," or a part implementation of
it in the near future, despite the growing awareness and compliance
regarding electronic data interchange (EDI) by certain industry and
government segments in the region. This is according to International
Data Corporation (IDC), a market research and consulting firm.

In a recently published study on the Asia-Pacific printer market, IDC
forecasts a 15 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in terms
of unit shipments, and a 20 percent CAGR in terms of value shipments
of printers for the 1995 to 1999 period. In 1994, regional printer
off-takes stood at 3,630,482 units worth $2.785 billion, with the small
office/home office (SOHO) as the largest application segment, IDC said.

The Asia Pacific region, according to IDC definitions, is composed of
the large country markets of Australia and Korea, the economically
vibrant markets of Singapore and Hongkong, and the emerging markets of
the Philippines, Vietnam, China, India, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

The market for impact printers (serial dot-matrix and line printers) is
not likely to peak in the next few years. In 1994, impact printers made
up 43 percent of the market share in units and 30 percent in value. By
1998, according to IDC projections, the impact market is estimated to
be less than 30 percent of the total printer market in unit shipments,
and around 12 to 18 percent in value. Inkjet printers are the biggest
threat to the market, particularly the 24-pin serial dot-matrix printers,
because inkjets are now priced at or below $500.

In the non-impact market (inkjet, laser, and thermal printers), inkjets
are currently growing in unit shipments at a much faster rate when
compared to laser printers. IDC predicts that inkjet prices will slip
further as this printer type continues to grow and eat into the impact
market share. By 1998, however, "inkjets are expected to plateau
and lasers will get into replacing inkjets, especially in areas where
speed is a significant factor," said IDC.

As for the future of thermal printers, IDC predicts that it will be
slow in unit shipment terms. "Thermals, to an extent, have got into a
niche market and it seems rather unlikely that they will come out of it
and proliferate into the general corporate applications in the near
future."

In a related survey on printer sales in the Philippines during the first
half of 1995, IDC marks that the local printer market posted sales of
about 48,160 units, worth $27.8 million.

The IDC study reveals that domestic printer market revenues in the
January to June period of 1995 surpassed that of the first half of 1994
by approximately 48 percent.

Of the total amount of printers sold in the country in the first half of
1995, serial dot-matrix (24-pin and nine-pin) printers accounted for
59 percent of market revenues. Laser printers made up 19 percent of
the market, while inkjet printers took up 17 percent. IDC further
notes that the share of inkjets to domestic printer market revenues in
the first half of 1995 exceeded that of the first half of 1994 by 100
percent.

The studies on printer sales in the Asia-Pacific and in the Philippine
markets were prepared by the IDC Asia-Pacific office based in Hongkong.
The IDC Philippines office is currently conducting a survey on the
demand of information technology (IT) products.

Philippines - Cisco Office Now In Operation 01/03/96

Philippines - Cisco Office Now In Operation 01/03/96
MANILA, PHILIPPINES, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Cisco Systems Inc. has
announced the opening of its representative office in the Philippines.

According to J.T. Yeoh, managing director of Cisco's South Asia
Operations, the goal of the representative office in the Philippines is
not to replace Cisco resellers, but to further extend customer support
and to "educate the market." Yeoh also disclosed that the company is
investing US$3 million over a period of three years.

Yeoh further revealed that Cisco had a 300% revenue growth in the
country from 1994 to 1995, and that same three-digit growth is
targeted for 1996.

"That we did establish our office this year as we have earlier
announced is a test of our commitment to helping the Philippine
market grow," said Cynthia N. Torres, country manager of the
Philippine office.

The Philippine representative office, Cisco Systems' 12th in Asia
and 90th worldwide, has a staff of three. Within 1996, the office
aims to expand the staff to six.

Resellers in the Philippines which have been largely responsible
for pushing Cisco products in the market include Ayala Systems
Technology Inc., Computer Network Systems Corp., Phil-Data
Business Systems, and Fujitsu Philippines Inc.

Cisco also has three active global partners -- Alcatel, Siemens,
and Olivetti -- and maintains worldwide relationships with Hewlett-
Packard, AT&T, Unisys, and Digital Equipment.

 ****Telecom Bill Hits New Trouble 01/03/96

 ****Telecom Bill Hits New Trouble 01/03/96
WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- The
telecommunications reform legislation has become a political
house of cards that could collapse with the slightest ill wind.
Prospects for passage remain in doubt with Congress back in
Washington and seemingly paralyzed by the budget impasse.

The latest episode in the telecommunications drama took place
late last week, when Senate Majority Leader (and likely GOP
presidential nominee) Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said he had problems
with a "multi-billion dollar giveaway" to broadcasters contained
in the compromise legislation that has emerged from a joint
House-Senate conference committee.

The provision, sought most avidly by House Republicans, would
reserve a portion of the broadcast spectrum for free licenses
for digital television. Government officials estimate that the
licenses are worth between $11 billion and $70 billion, if they
were auctioned off, the way other new spectrum allocations have
been handled.

In a news conference, Dole singled out the spectrum allocation
as one of "three or four or five provisions" that Republicans
should re-examine in the complex legislation.

Dole's comments put Sen. Larry Pressler (R-S.D.), nominally the
Republican front man on the issue, into near panic. "If we get
into a controversy over the spectrum again," he said, "the bill
is going to die."

But Pressler has lost leadership on the issue, which has fallen
to Sen. Ernest "Fritz" Hollings (D-S.C.), ranking Democrat on
Pressler's Senate Commerce Committee and former chairman.
Hollings has used the threat of a filibuster to win changes in
the legislation sought by the Democrats.

Earlier, House Republican freshmen objected to the deal their
leaders negotiated in the conference committee, particularly
limits on media cross-ownership that was a bottom line issue for
the Democrats and the White House.

Ironically, Vice President Al Gore's bragging following the
unveiling of the compromise bill that the White House got
everything it wanted contributed to the revolt of the GOP
freshmen. "If Al Gore was crowing, that meant we got rolled," a
staffer for a Republican freshman told Newsbytes.

The 281-page text of the bill is now circulating among
lawmakers, and the leadership hopes to work out a schedule for
action this week.

"But it could all come unglued very quickly," warns a House
Democratic aide.

Federal Shutdown Web Page 01/03/96

Federal Shutdown Web Page 01/03/96
WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- As Washington enters
the third week of the partial government shutdown, a local business
has created a World Wide Web site intended to help tourists find
places to visit in the Nation's Capital.

The site, called Shutdown '95, has also become a place for
disgruntled bureaucrats to vent their irritation at their
political masters. The site includes e-mail links to House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-Kan.), and President Clinton.

It also has listings of museums and other attractions in the
Washington area that are still open to the public.

The frustrated federal employees contacting Shutdown '95 have
spread the blame around. One called Gingrich "a spy sent by
alien life forms to disrupt the lives of ordinary Americans."
Others have savaged Clinton and Dole.

The site is being maintained by Business Information Network, a
Maryland firm that specializes in creating Web pages for others,
including some government agencies.

"The idea came to me when some friends who were visiting from
Philadelphia got upset that their trip to DC had been ruined by
the shutdown," says Joanna Pineda, president of Business
Information Network. "Since they weren't from the area, they
thought the only things left to do were to go shopping or maybe
eat out."

He continued: "And then it hit me. I've been living in the DC area
since 1989 and I know dozens of fabulous places in this area that
are completely unaffected by the shutdown. These museums, galleries,
and other entertainment centers are open! We're hoping that
this home page will help disaffected tourists and residents
alike enjoy the many other attractions that DC has to offer. I
want people to have wonderful vacations here and leave DC with
great memories. This is a great city, shutdown or not!"

The opening graphic of the site is an empty House of
Representatives, which is somewhat misleading, as Congress is
still in business and has not been affected by the shutdown. The
site also includes a graphic of the White House with a red slash
through it.

The Web page says it is "your starting point for having a
wonderful time in Washington in spite of Bill, Bob, and Newt."

The Web site is located at http://www.bizinfonet.com/shutdown .

Texas Instruments & Samsung Continue Patent Dispute 01/03/96

Texas Instruments & Samsung Continue Patent Dispute 01/03/96
DALLAS, TEXAS, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Texas Instruments Inc.
(NYSE: TXN) and Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd could be
chipping away at each other in a courtroom if the two companies
can't settle patent infringement allegations.

TI has filed a suit in the Federal District Court for the Eastern
District of Texas that alleges patent infringement by Samsung in the
manufacture of semiconductor devices, including dynamic random access
memory (DRAM) chips. A TI spokesperson said the suit asks for
unspecified damages. Samsung has countered with a suit of its own
alleging infringement of 13 of Samsung's US patents by TI.

The suits come after the two companies were unsuccessful in
negotiating the renewal of a five-year semiconductor patent
cross-licensing agreement that expired December 31, 1995. The
negotiations went on for almost one year.

"We have been through this before," TI spokesperson Neil McGlone
told Newsbytes. He was referring to the fact that the five-year
agreement was the result of a patent infringement suit filed by TI
against Samsung in 1990. It took two years to hammer out that
agreement.

Richard Agnich, TI senior vice president and general counsel, said
the company is protecting its investment of billions of dollars in
research and development. A number of TI patent licensing
agreements were scheduled to expire at the end of 1995 or in early
1996. In addition to Samsung, those agreements include deals with
NEC, Fujitsu, and Nippon Denso. TI expects to realize an estimated
$108 million in royalties from those agreements in the fourth
quarter, which ended December 31. McGlone said Samsung accounted
for a majority of that amount.

TI expects to announce its fourth quarter and fiscal 1995 results
on January 23. While he wouldn't comment on what those results
would be, McGlone told Newsbytes, "1995 was a very good year for the
entire industry and we expect the news to be in line with that kind
of growth."

TI said it will also file a complaint with the International
Trade Commission asking that group to prevent Samsung from importing
devices that infringe TI's patents.

In addition to patent infringement allegations, Samsung also
requested the court to declare that the patents owned by TI are
not infringed by Samsung and are invalid and unenforceable.

Samsung is building a semiconductor fabrication facility in
Austin, Texas, that is expected to become operational by early
1998.

 ****CompuServe Suspends Access To 200 Newsgroups 01/03/96

 ****CompuServe Suspends Access To 200 Newsgroups 01/03/96
COLUMBUS, OHIO, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- CompuServe made international
headlines this past week when it announced it would temporarily suspend
access to more than 200 Internet newsgroups. Contacted by German
authorities, the online giant was told the delivery of "certain specified
newsgroups" carrying pornographic material constituted a violation of
German criminal law.

Across a number of Internet newsgroups, CompuServe is the object of
criticism for what some Internet users are calling "severe censorship."
The German government says the investigation into the groups is
focused on compliance with the country's laws regarding pornography.

In a formal statement, CompuServe said it was not involved with
determining the specified groups, but would temporarily suspend access
to the groups in order to adhere to an ongoing German investigation.
German authorities ordered CompuServe to do what was necessary to comply
with German laws regarding child pornography, other pornographic material
illegal for adults, and potentially illegal material for minors.

Newsbytes learned the 200+ list includes newsgroups such as:
alt.magick.sex, alt.religion.sexuality; alt.homosexual, alt.sex, and
gay-net.coming-out.

CompuServe says it is working with German officials to resolve the
matters in question and since altering the content of any of the groups
in question is not possible, the only alternative is the temporary
suspension.

Unlike its main competitors -- America Online (AOL) and Prodigy --
CompuServe has offered its online services internationally since 1979.
AOL is just now establishing a European presence through a partnership
with Bertelsmann in Germany. In a recent announcement, CompuServe said
its European subscriber base numbered in excess of 500,000 with another
200,000 in Great Britain.

Outlining the problem, Kim Scher, a spokesperson for CompuServe, told
Newsbytes, "We have received the fullest possible reaction to the
announced suspension of these newsgroups. From negative comments to
praise, responses from our members seem to cover the full gamut of
reactions. What people may not realize is that our only choice was to
suspend the groups in question. The prosecutor in Munich, Germany,
informed us our employees in Germany could face prosecution."

Scher said CompuServe does not, at this time, have the capability to
suspend the listed newsgroups only in Germany. "We have worked
intensely over the holidays to build segments which will allow us to
control the delivery of Internet content to specific countries," said
Scher. "Once we have that capability built into our online technology,
we will be able to comply with the laws of specific countries."

"Other online services and Internet providers will be watching our
response to this issue in Germany. Around the world, the Internet will
be met by different national legal systems and some of those may be
more strict than Germany," said Scher. Instead of a universal Internet,
users across the world may see a national or regional delivery of
Internet content, claim some observers.

 ****AT&T Restructuring To Cost $6Bil & 40,000 Jobs 01/03/96

 ****AT&T Restructuring To Cost $6Bil & 40,000 Jobs 01/03/96
NEW YORK, NEW YORK, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Breaking up, as the song
said, is hard to do. That's especially true if you work for AT&T (NYSE:T),
which has announced it will cut about 40,000 jobs in its telecommunications
services and systems and technology companies as these and AT&T Global
Information Solutions become independent firms.

AT&T Global Information Solutions, the company's computer operation,
had already announced plans to shed about 8,500 jobs as part of the
restructuring. AT&T said its latest announcement will not affect AT&T GIS.
The 40,000 figure does include roughly 6,500 managers who have already
taken a voluntary severance package, officials said.

In a teleconference Tuesday, Rick Miller, senior executive vice-president
and chief financial officer, said AT&T will take a charge of about $6
billion before taxes for the breakup, which the company announced in
September. Of this, Miller said, about $2.6 billion will cover the cost
of separation agreements with employees who lose their jobs. Another $1.1
billion has been allocated for closing facilities, and $1.7 billion for
asset write-offs.

After taxes, the charge is expected to reduce AT&T's fourth-quarter earnings
by about $4 billion. The company has not released projected fourth-quarter
financials yet, but given that its earnings in the first nine months of
the year were only $2.82 billion, it seems clear the special charge will
lead to a sizable loss in the quarter, and could put AT&T in the red for
the year. AT&T took a post-tax charge of $1.17 billion in the third quarter
to cover cuts in AT&T GIS and other actions.

AT&T announced in September that it would break into three units. One
company, offering telecommunications services, will keep the AT&T name.
A new systems and technology company -- theoretically freed by the breakup
to sell its wares more easily to potential competitors -- will go public
some time in the first half of this year. It has not yet been named. AT&T
GIS, which is essentially the former NCR Corp., will be the third separate
entity.

AT&T officials said some 4,000 of the jobs that will disappear are in
businesses the company plans to sell anyway, so those people will have
some hope of keeping their jobs under new ownership. Coupled with the
6,500 managerial jobs already cut through voluntary packages, this means
about 30,000 layoffs are looming. Of the 40,000 jobs cut altogether, AT&T
said, about 17,000 will be in the services business, and the other 23,000
in the systems and technology operations. If implemented today, these cuts
would leave the services business with 110,000 employees, and the systems
and technology company with 108,000. When it announced the breakup in
September, AT&T had about 303,000 employees.

About 70 percent of the job cuts will be completed by the end of 1996,
Miller said.

Miller said AT&T will be announcing further divestitures like the already-
revealed plan to sell its Paradyne unit. He also said some international
investments, including the company's stake in Canadian long-distance
carrier Unitel Communications Inc., are to be revalued. Plans also include
writing off some technology that is obsolete or no longer strategic, such
as hardware related to the Telex business and proprietary online software
whose marketability is threatened by the current move to the Internet.

Miller said plans for the breakup are moving ahead on schedule, with the
leadership of the three companies now appointed and organizational
structures designed. AT&T plans to file a prospectus for the systems and
technology company's initial public offering with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) by the end of January, he said, and the
offering is expected this quarter.

STD Claims First With Canadian-Built PowerPC Systems 01/03/96

STD Claims First With Canadian-Built PowerPC Systems 01/03/96
LONDON, ONTARIO, CANADA, 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- STD Systems Inc. has begun
shipping its Power2 workstations and servers, based on PowerPC chips, to
Canadian universities, government buyers, and smaller corporations. The
company claimed it is the first to build PowerPC systems in Canada.

The Power2 systems, additions to STD's CompuPartner product line, use
PowerPC 603, 603e, and 604 reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
processors on Motorola Corp. Atlas motherboards. They ship with
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system.

Abe Ellorin, an STD account manager, told Newsbytes that his company
sells most of its products in Canada and does all its development there.
Motherboards and other components are mainly imported, he said, though
STD assembles the systems in three Canadian manufacturing plants.

Higher education is a major market for STD, Ellorin said, but the
company also sells to the federal government and is pursuing small
corporate accounts. Seven-year-old STD claims to have a 19 percent share
of the educational PC market in Canada.

Company officials said the PowerPC technology is ideally suited to
research and high-end applications where customers need powerful central
processors. STD said it hopes for "a few million dollars" in sales of
the systems in 1996, growing in future years as more PowerPC-based
software comes to market.

The PowerPC processors, used in newer Apple Computer Inc. Macintoshes,
some IBM RISC System/6000 machines and computers from several other
vendors, are the result of a joint development effort by Apple, IBM,
and Motorola.

Prices for the CompuPartner Power2 systems will range from C$4,000
upward, with top-of-the-line systems starting around C$8,000, Ellorin
said.

STD Systems has a site on the World Wide Web at http://www.std.ca .

Security Dynamics Plans To License "Concryption" 01/03/96

Security Dynamics Plans To License "Concryption" 01/03/96
CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Security
Dynamics plans to license "Concryption," a just patented
technology combining encryption and compression, to outside
companies for use with a variety of security and compression
protocols, revealed Kenneth Weiss, chairman and chief technical
officer, during an interview with Newsbytes.

"It is my belief that Concryption will solve the two biggest
problems that exist today: the need for privacy and more
available bandwidth," Weiss told Newsbytes.

"Compression has been catching on. It takes less time today to
send a whole page of fax than it used to, for example, and part
of that is because of better data compression. But encryption has
not caught on in the way it should, because of time and expense
issues and the hassles of key management."

Still, though, available bandwidth for data storage and
transmission is diminishing all the time, in arenas ranging from
fax to satellite technology, networked information, and the World
Wide Web, according to the company chairman.

Compression will become an even more significant requirement in
the future, with an anticipated explosion of multimedia applications,
he predicted.

Security Dynamics has been awarded US Patent No. 5,479,512 for
Concryption. The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company now holds
a total of 14 patents from the US Patent Office, most related
to its "core business" of computer security, he reported.

One of the company's other patents, for instance, is for a
biometric technology designed to enable "voice fingerprinting."
Security Dynamics also produces the SecureID Card, ACE/Server,
and ACM series of user authentication products.

Security Dynamics' newly patented Concryption technology is based
on mathematical synergies between the processes of encrypting and
compressing data, Newsbytes was told. Both procedures call for
analyzing arrays of binary patterns, "seeing where the spaces
are," and then applying rules to the data.

Weiss added that encryption and compression are both highly
intensive in terms of CPU (central processor unit) cycles and
disk accesses. As a result, he asserted, integrating the two
technologies into a "single set of operations" will bring cost
reductions in CPU usage as well as faster encryption times.

"The time to compress might increase a little bit, but on the
other hand, the time to encrypt goes to zero. Whatever the disk
accesses are for compression, there would be no other disk
accesses for encryption."

Security Dynamics sees Concryption as a "concept pattern" suited
to use with a variety of data types, network transports, and
security protocols, according to Weiss. "This is a new enabling
technology that we believe should have an impact on the way
information is communicated in the future."

The company intends to work with outside licensees on integrating
different compression and encryption methods. "Big users have
already optimized compression for their unique technologies. We
use a different form of compression for fax than we would for
satellite data or TV pictures. Beyond that, companies might
employ different compression algorithms. Similarly, people like
to have control over the type of encryption used," Weiss
maintained.

Although forthcoming multimedia applications will require much
greater compression than text, conventional needs for "privacy"
may not be as high, since many video offerings of the future will
be geared to entertainment, Weiss acknowledged.

"But we will probably be seeing `economic privacy,'" the company
chairman noted, pointing to a trend, already well established in
the cable TV industry, toward providing "high demand" fare such
as first-run movies only on separately priced, encrypted,
"premium channels."

Pipeline Ships Electronic Customer Registration Product 01/03/96

Pipeline Ships Electronic Customer Registration Product 01/03/96
ATLANTA, GEORGIA, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Pipeline Communications
Inc. rolled into the new year with the release of Pipeline API Toolkit
for Windows 95, an electronic customer registration product which
provides hardware and software developers with tools to enable online
registration of Windows 95 programs.

The company said the API (application programming interface) toolkit
is "the answer" to low product registration via the traditional
postcard method. The company said the traditional registration
method yields only a 10-20 percent registration. The company
claims registrations jump by as much as 80 percent for applications
using the electronic registration method. Failure to register a
software product means the user doesn't get information about
upgrades and may have difficulty getting technical support.

According to Pipeline, the electronic registration information
goes into the company's worldwide data center in Atlanta, where it
is processed and incorporated into the secure customer registration
database of the appropriate vendor. Pipeline said it can provide
electronic product registration in more than 90 countries,
using x.25 communications and global 800 service.

A company representative told Newsbytes the developer can implement one
of several standard registrations or customize the process to gather
the information the developer needs. The registration can include,
what Pipeline calls, "reminder technology" which causes a registration
reminder to periodically appear on screen that reminds the user of the
benefits of registering the software.

"Sometimes the user is excited about buying a new product, like a game,
and they don't want to take the time to register right now. They want
to do it later," said a company official.

Pipeline spokesperson Phil Hall told Newsbytes the registration
database information is provided to the developer for marketing
purposes such as sending users discount coupons for upcoming
products and performing customer surveys.

The Pipeline API toolkit for Windows 95 has a suggested retail
price of $995 and is shipping now. The new software adds to
Pipeline's family of similar products for Windows 3.1, DOS, and
Macintosh-based products. The developer does not have to pay any
royalty fees for applications using the toolkit.

Real-Time Quotes For $30 Per Month 01/03/96

Real-Time Quotes For $30 Per Month 01/03/96
SAN MATEO, CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Data Broadcasting
Corporation (NASDAQ: DBCC) has announced a new Internet financial data
service, DBC MarketWatch. It will offer real-time stock market data
over the Internet at prices now charged for delayed services.

DBC MarketWatch, which will go live on DBC's existing Internet site at
www.dbc.com beginning March 1, will be priced at $29.95 per month,
and will include real-time stock market quotes, fundamental and
historical data, a specialized business news headline service,
portfolio features, links to online brokerage services, and other
investment-related services.

The price includes mandatory exchange fees of approximately
$13 per month to cover the New York, American, and Nasdaq stock
exchanges. Financial exchanges require individual investors, who
receive market trading data in real time, to sign contracts and pay
"certain fees" to those exchanges. DBC will manage the exchange
contract and fee process for the customer.

Larry Kramer, vice president of online services for DBC, told
Newsbytes, "Non-professionals have lower exchange fees than
professional financial users do. Every subscriber to DBC MarketWatch
must pay a monthly fee to the each of the exchanges. The total of all
the fees for our service is less than $13, and the fees are included
in the DBC monthly charge. Almost all online access to quotes are on
a 15 minute delay. This service is real time for a price of most
delayed services."

The new Internet-based DBC MarketWatch will allow new customers
access to large databases of historical, fundamental, and text data.
Eventually, DBC MarketWatch will be available to all of DBC's
real-time broadcast customers at no extra charge.

"DBC MarketWatch makes the world of real-time financial data
affordable to virtually any investor for the first time," said Alan
Hirschfield, DBC's co-chairman and co-chief executive officer. "We
think this is a prime example of how the Internet presents the
opportunity to bring valuable financial information to the public."

He continued: "Our real-time Internet product is designed to reach
the broad consumer market and to provide an affordable subset of the
information we offer over our private networks. This consumer service
represents a vast improvement over information traditionally available
at these price points to this audience -- which until now has largely
been restricted to data delayed at least 15 minutes."

According to DBC, delayed quotes have been available on DBC's Web
site for the past four months, where requests for these quotes are
currently averaging 750,000 hits per day.

Through its DBC West and BMI services, DBC now delivers real-time
stock quotes, financial and sports news and betting odds to more than
30,000 subscribers via wireless FM, cable, and satellite transmission.
Another DBC company -- Capital Management Sciences -- provides fixed
income portfolio analytics used for valuation and risk management.

 ****Cyrix Expects Loss, Writes Off Entire 486 Inventory 01/03/96

 ****Cyrix Expects Loss, Writes Off Entire 486 Inventory 01/03/96
RICHARDSON, TEXAS, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Cyrix Corp. (NASDAQ:CYRX)
has announced it will report a loss for the quarter ending December 31,
and will take a write-off for its entire remaining inventory of 486 chips.

While final numbers aren't available yet, the company said the loss
could be more than $0.40 per share. The financial report is scheduled
for release after the market closes on January 18, 1996. For the first
nine months of the year, the company reported net income of $25.5
million, or $1.28 per share.

The loss, the first in the company's seven-year history, puts Cyrix
in technical default of terms of its credit agreements. Dumping the
486 products means the company is pinning its hopes of becoming a
significant challenger to Intel Corp.'s Pentium chip on Cyrix's M1
6x86 100 megahertz (MHz) and 120MHz chips. The M1 started shipping
in September, 1995.

Jerry Rogers, Cyrix chief executive officer, admits poor product
execution got him in trouble early in the year. He said the company
has about 300,000 486 chips on hand.

Cyrix has an $88 million agreement with IBM Credit Corp. and is
negotiating with IBM to extend a waiver on the technical violation.
The company stressed that it hasn't missed any debt payments and
has over $35 million in the bank.

Cyrix spokesperson Evan Fitzmaurice told Newsbytes the company
expects to report the outcome of the negotiations with IBM on
January 18, although the announcement could come sooner. .

Rogers said the company's 5x86 chip is selling well into the
portables market. He predicts 6x86 production of about 175,000
chips in the first quarter.

Cyrix shares dipped 2-1/8 to 23 after the announcement. Today
the stock had rebounded to $23.625.

America Online Warns Members Of Password Security 01/03/96

America Online Warns Members Of Password Security 01/03/96
VIENNA, VIRGINIA, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Acknowledging a password
security problem, America Online's (NASDAQ:AMER) president, Steve Case,
has sent a letter to all AOL subscribers urging them to never reveal
their passwords. To acquire AOL user passwords, hackers are reportedly
using e-mail and instant messages under the guise of AOL management.

In his letter to subscribers, Case says the latest hacker ploy is to
establish a correspondence which appears to come from AOL. A sample
letter reads in part: "Dear AOL Community Member: AOL is experiencing
major problems...due to a virus that was recently loaded...onto our main
user database, containing most of our member registration information,
we are currently experiencing widespread system failure. The problem
originated...when our system was illegally breached by a former employee."

America Online says that "this or any similar letter is entirely false
and should be reported to AOL management."

The letter continues with a description of a virus which supposedly
corrupted AOL's database link files and asks users to help the company
re-establish the database and help AOL solve the problem by providing
password information.

Online Instant Messages, known as IMs, are also being used to falsely
acquire passwords. A hacker will approach an AOL member with a
message identifying the sender as an AOL employee and attempt to
acquire a user's password.

Case clearly states the company's policy is to never have an employee
ask for a member's password under any condition. He requests that any
attempt or suspected attempt be immediately reported to AOL management.

Once a hacker has a user's password, hundreds of dollars of online time
can be charged to the user's account. Such information will not appear
until the user receives a monthly statement. AOL members who attempt
to sign onto the service and receive a message saying the account is
currently being used should also contact AOL immediately.

Advising members to be security conscious, Case suggests users change
their passwords to at least six alphanumeric characters for all of
their sub-accounts. As part of its service, AOL allows members to have
several different identities under sub-accounts. Passwords for all
accounts should be routinely changed.

Case also suggests that members do not use common words such as a
city, state, nickname, street, first name, address, or area codes as
passwords. Hackers often have programs which search for common words.

The letter closes saying the problem is not widespread, but deserves
immediate attention from the "entire AOL community." To combat the
problem, Case said "appropriate legal action" would be taken against
suspected perpetrators.

 ****Web Slowdown In 1996, Followed By Boom, Says IDC 01/03/96

 ****Web Slowdown In 1996, Followed By Boom, Says IDC 01/03/96
FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS, U.S.A., 1996 JAN 3 (NB) -- Although
the World Wide Web will undergo a temporary slowdown in 1996,
International Data Corp. (IDC) is "bullish" on the Internet's prospects
for the next five to 10 years, predicting growth in numbers of online
users to more than 200 million and in electronic commerce revenues
to more than $200 billion by the year 2000, said Frank Gens, senior
VP of research, in a conference call with Newsbytes.

Gens compared the Web's outlook for 1996 to the "lag time" that
set in for the PC industry during the 1982 to 1983 time frame,
when the supporting infrastructure for PCs remained "weak" and
some early users grew "disappointed."

Over the year ahead, a total of about 35 of the Fortune 500
companies will abandon their current commercial Web sites,
resulting in the emergence "ghost sites," Gens added.

At the same time, though, also by the close of 1996, somewhere
between 150 and 200 of the Fortune 500 firms can be expected to
open new Web sites, the senior VP told Newsbytes.

"First wave," back-office functions such as airline reservation
systems and "second wave" tasks in the area of office automation
will continue to be carried out on the Internet. But many of the
newer sites will be aimed at a "third wave" of Internet
applications, calling for online communications with consumers,
said Gens.

Accordingly, also over the coming year, PC makers will be making
consumers a major target. "Internet appliances" will hit the
market for as little as $100 to $300, and full-fledged multimedia
PCs will be available for under $1,000, not including monitor, he
reported.

"The next five to 10 years will also be an era of a turnover in
leaders," Gens asserted. Drawing another parallel with the PC
industry, the IDC exec pointed out that among today's top 20 IT
(information technology) manufacturers, only ten companies even
existed 10 or 15 years ago.

Online service providers will find that they must adapt to the
Web or fade away, Gens added, foreseeing a rough road ahead for
two of today's four major online service providers.

"Some (online service providers) will do well, but others will
culturally choke on the Web. The question will turn on whether
these companies can change their business models from the old,
proprietary `Club Med' model. Users are saying, `We don't want
this very safe, walled world. We don't want to be confined,'"
Newsbytes was told.

Current industry leaders like IBM, Apple, and Microsoft will also
be faced with tough choices, according to Gens. IBM will need to
decide whether to continue to target consumers via Prodigy.

Apple will have to determine whether to remain in the hardware
business, or to concentrate strictly on its long-time strength of
"human interface" software technology, either merging or
aligning itself with another OEM (original equipment manufacturer).

On Microsoft's part, the choice will boil down to focusing on
consumers through the Microsoft Network (MSN), or on Windows NT-
based office and Web servers, so as to avoid "stretching itself
too thin" in a market where "for the first time, Microsoft is not
setting all the rules."

"If I were Microsoft, I'd go toward the consumer," Gens noted. To
date, he added, Windows NT has not shown the "scalability" of
Unix, a "reality" that will become particularly important "with
all those users piling on to the Net."

On the whole, though, the Web will contribute to a growth in IT
industry revenues from $500 billion to more than $2.5 trillion by
2010, according to Gens.

Product areas that look particularly promising include object-
oriented development tools and, for telecommunications carriers,
local Internet access. "If (the US Telecommunications Act) goes
through, companies like AT&T, MCI, and Sprint will have carte
blanche. The monopoly of the local Bells will be broken."

Meanwhile, computer industry market analysts such as IDC are
adjusting their sights toward a view that encompasses broader
economics, taking into account not just revenues for IT companies
but for the other industries that stand to profit from the Web,
said Gens.

The Web will allow publishers, for example, to cut their costs by
80 percent, while at the same time enjoying "much broader market
reach" and instant distribution, he illustrated.

And insurance firms, which currently spend 60 cents on
distribution for every dollar earned, will be spared the expense
of sending a salesperson into "every prospect's living room," the
senior VP told Newsbytes.

7 ->  ****European Cross-Border Decency Laws In Spotlight -- The decision
by Compuserve to remove 20 Usenet newsgroups after complaints from German
legislators is not the first time cross-border decency and obscenity has
reared its head in Europe. The British government has already experienced
the problems universal access can cause in the satellite television sector
and other nations have been angered by cross-border broadcasting.

8 -> Final Stuff Technology Claims Against Storagetek Dismissed -- A judge
has dismissed the last two charges in a lawsuit that charged that Storage
Technology Corp. (NYSE: STK) had breached a 1990 agreement with Stuff
Technology Partners, a former development partner. Stuff had sought $2.4
billion in its original suit.

9 -> New UK Nat'l Internet Service Provider -- Open Integration, a well-
known computer systems supplier, has set up a subsidiary operation to
offer Internet services. Known as Cyberphile, the Internet service
provider (SP) claims that, thanks to its parentage and a UKP500,000
investment in a fiber optic network spanning the UK, it can offer
"third-generation" Internet facilities to its customers.

10 -> Telecom Ireland Links To Internet Backbone Via MCI -- Telecom
Ireland has contracted with MCI to take a two megabits-per-second (Mbps)
link from Telecom Ireland's headquarters in Dublin to MCI's Internet
backbone in the US. According to David Hughes, a spokesperson for Telecom
Ireland, the link will mean that more than 40 percent of all Internet

in the US.

11 -> America Online Readies UK Rollout -- The UK will get its first taste
of America Online's European service later this month when the service is
officially launched to the media, prior to a formal public launch in
March, Newsbytes has learned. Although the plans are top secret prior to a
media launch in two weeks time, Newsbytes has discovered that UK pricing
has been set at UKP3.95 per month for up to five hours of access, and
extra hours billable at UKP1.85 each.

12 -> China - Large-Scale Production Of Windows 95 Starts -- The Chinese

input methods recommended by the Chinese Committee on Information
Technology Standards (CCITS).

13 -> China - Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom Project Founded -- An
Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecom project has recently been founded by six
entities from China and Singapore with the intention of providing mobile
phone services to any place in the Asia-Pacific region.

14 -> Philippines - National Telecoms Commission Plans Growth -- A recent
report released by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC)
projects that, three years from now, there will be ten phones for every
one hundred Filipinos, and seven million main lines throughout the
Philippines. There are presently 1.9 million main lines in the country,
according to the NTC report.

15 -> Printer Sales In Asia-Pacific Unaffected By EDI -- Printer sales in
the Asia-Pacific region do not exhibit any signs of being affected by the
move towards a "paperless office concept," or a part implementation of it
in the near future, despite the growing awareness and compliance regarding
electronic data interchange (EDI) by certain industry and government
segments in the region. This is according to International Data
Corporation (IDC), a market research and consulting firm.

16 -> Philippines - Cisco Office Now In Operation -- Cisco Systems Inc.
has announced the opening of its representative office in the Philippines.

17 -> Canadian Product Launch Update -- This regular feature, appearing on
the first day Newsbytes publishes each week, provides further details for
the Canadian market on announcements by international companies that
Newsbytes has already covered. This week: Lotus Development's new Notes
Mail client and changes in Notes pricing.

18 ->  ****Telecom Bill Hits New Trouble -- The telecommunications reform
legislation has become a political house of cards that could collapse with
the slightest ill wind. Prospects for passage remain in doubt with
Congress back in Washington and seemingly paralyzed by the budget impasse.

19 -> Federal Shutdown Web Page -- As Washington enters the third week of
the partial government shutdown, a local business has created a World Wide
Web site intended to help tourists find places to visit in the Nation's
Capital.

20 -> Texas Instruments & Samsung Continue Patent Dispute -- Texas
Instruments Inc. (NYSE: TXN) and Korea-based Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd
could be chipping away at each other in a courtroom if the two companies
can't settle patent infringement allegations.

21 ->  ****CompuServe Suspends Access To 200 Newsgroups -- CompuServe made
international headlines this past week when it announced it would
temporarily suspend access to more than 200 Internet newsgroups. Contacted
by German authorities, the online giant was told the delivery of "certain
specified newsgroups" carrying pornographic material constituted a
violation of German criminal law.

22 ->  ****AT&T Restructuring To Cost $6Bil & 40,000 Jobs -- Breaking up,
as the song said, is hard to do. That's especially true if you work for
AT&T (NYSE:T), which has announced it will cut about 40,000 jobs in its
telecommunications services and systems and technology companies as these
and AT&T Global Information Solutions become independent firms.

23 -> STD Claims First With Canadian-Built PowerPC Systems -- STD Systems
Inc. has begun shipping its Power2 workstations and servers, based on
PowerPC chips, to Canadian universities, government buyers, and smaller
corporations. The company claimed it is the first to build PowerPC systems
in Canada.

24 -> Security Dynamics Plans To License "Concryption -- Security Dynamics
plans to license "Concryption," a just patented technology combining

security and compression protocols, revealed Kenneth Weiss, chairman and
chief technical officer, during an interview with Newsbytes.

25 -> Pipeline Ships Electronic Customer Registration Product -- Pipeline
Communications Inc. rolled into the new year with the release of Pipeline
API Toolkit for Windows 95, an electronic customer registration product
which provides hardware and software developers with tools to enable
online registration of Windows 95 programs.

26 -> Real-Time Quotes For $30 Per Month -- Data Broadcasting Corporation
(NASDAQ: DBCC) has announced a new Internet financial data service, DBC
MarketWatch. It will offer real-time stock market data over the Internet
at prices now charged for delayed services.

27 ->  ****Cyrix Expects Loss, Writes Off Entire 486 Inventory -- Cyrix
Corp. (NASDAQ:CYRX) has announced it will report a loss for the quarter
ending December 31, and will take a write-off for its entire remaining
inventory of 486 chips.

28 -> America Online Warns Members Of Password Security -- Acknowledging a
password security problem, America Online's (NASDAQ:AMER) president, Steve
Case, has sent a letter to all AOL subscribers urging them to never reveal
their passwords. To acquire AOL user passwords, hackers are reportedly
using e-mail and instant messages under the guise of AOL management.

29 ->  ****Web Slowdown In 1996, Followed By Boom, Says IDC -- Although
the World Wide Web will undergo a temporary slowdown in 1996,
International Data Corp. (IDC) is "bullish" on the Internet's prospects
for the next five to 10 years, predicting growth in numbers of online
users to more than 200 million and in electronic commerce revenues to more
than $200 billion by the year 2000, said Frank Gens, senior VP of
research, in a conference call with Newsbytes.
