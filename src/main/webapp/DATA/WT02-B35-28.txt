SALP HISTORY REPORT

Note: NRC's SALP program was revised July 14, 1993 (NRC Management 
directive 8.6). NRC says that ``the final rating for each functional area
will be a composite rating of the performance based on a knowledgeable
balancing of the issues in a functional area and their safety significance.
Statistical or numerical balancing of data is inappropriate.'' With this
revision NRC has reduced the number of functional areas to four: plant
operations, maintenance, engineering, and plant support. This last area
includes activities such as radiological controls, emergency preparedness,
security, chemistry, and fire protection.

FOOTNOTES:
RPT - date report issued
ASSMT. PERIOD - assessment period
OPS - plant operations
RCON - radiological controls
MNT/SURV - maintenance, surveillance
EP - emergency preparedness
SEC - security
ENG/TS - engineering/technical support
SA - safety assessment/quality verification
PLSP - plant support
N - not rated

Category 1--Licensee attention and involvement have been properly focused
on safety and resulted in a superior level of safety performance. Licensee
programs and procedures have provided effective controls. The licensee's
self-assessment efforts have been effective in the identification of
emergent issues. Corrective actions are technically sound, comprehensive,
and thorough. Recurring problems are eliminated and resolution of issues is
timely. Root cause analyses are thorough.

Category 2--Licensee attention and involvement are normally well focused
and resulted in a good level of safety performance. Licensee programs and
procedures normally provide the necessary control of activities, but
deficiencies may exist. The licensee's self-assessments are normally good,
although issues may escape identification. Corrective actions are usually
effective, although some may not be complete. Root cause analyses are
normally thorough.

Category 3--Licensee attention and involvement have resulted in an
acceptable level of safety performance. However, licensee performance may
exhibit one or more of the following characteristics. Licensee programs and
procedures have not provided sufficient control of activities in important
areas. The licensee's self-assessment efforts may not occur until after a
potential problem becomes apparent. A clear understanding of the safety
implications of significant issues may not have been demonstrated. Numerous
minor issues combine to indicate that the licensee's corrective action is
not thorough. Root cause analyses do not probe enough, resulting in the
incomplete resolution of issues. Because the margin to unacceptable
performance in important aspects is small, increased NRC and licensee
attention is required.

Category N--Insufficient information exists to support an assessment of
licensee performance. These cases include instances in which a rating
cannot be developed because of insufficient licensee activity or
insufficient NRC inspection. The category is normally used for construction
phase reactors only.

INDUSTRY CBLA SAVINGS NEAR $600-MILLION MARK THROUGH MID-DECEMBER

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   The nuclear utility industry estimates total savings of $590-million in
averted costs from NRC's cost-beneficial licensing action (CBLA) program
through mid-December, 1995.
   Industry interest in the agency's CBLA program was about the same in
1995 as during the previous year, with utilities submitting 116 CBLA
requests through December 14, 1995 compared with 123 requests in 1994,
according to NRC's semi-annual report on the program. But industry
estimates of the savings gained through licensing actions approved by the
NRC dropped significantly from the previous year.
   In 1995, NRC approved 115 CBLA requests for a total estimated savings of
$235-million. During 1994, the agency approved 52 CBLA requests, totalling
$335-million in expected savings over the remaining operating lifetimes of
the affected nuclear power plants. In 1993, the first year of the program,
utilities projected $20-million in savings from 33 approved CBLA requests.
   The declining value of the estimated savings ``likely reflects [the
fact] that the licensees initially submitted CBLA requests with the
greatest value,'' Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) Director
William Russell said in a December 28, 1995 memorandum to Executive
Director for Operations James Taylor. Russell suggested that future
amendment requests will continue to show declining savings.
   However, Russell said that the economic impact of the CBLA program is
difficult to assess because utilities are ``not very specific'' with their
cost savings information. He cautioned that the industry's projected
$590-million total lifetime savings are based on conservative estimates by
utilities and could actually reflect higher savings.
   ``We believe that the combined lifetime industry savings is a very
conservative estimate because some licensees have not provided total
estimated savings but rather have simply indicated that savings realized
from the CBLA would exceed the $100,000 criteria,'' he said. ``For
uniformity, cost data submitted by licensees are presented as savings over
the remainder of the 40-year plant design life.''
   The CBLA program, which has been institutionalized in NRR, grew out of a
task force established in April 1993 as part of an NRC effort to help
nuclear utilities control operations and maintenance costs. The CBLA task
force was one of several groups established within the agency to work on
streamlining the regulatory process and reducing regulatory burdens on
industry.
   Two years ago, the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) forecast that
utilities would submit 400 CBLA requests a year during 1994 and 1995--far
more than have actually been submitted. Of the 272 CBLA requests submitted
by utilities so far, the NRC has approved 173 and denied 11. Utilities
withdrew three requests, and 85 submittals are still under review.
   During the six-month period ending December 14, the NRC denied one CBLA
request, a submittal by Northeast Nuclear Energy Co. for Millstone-1. The
utility had requested a revised exemption from Appendix R to eliminate
reliance on maronite boards as radiant heat shields in the cable vault
area. The NRC decided that the proposal would not provide an ``equivalent
level of fire safety to that required by Section III.G of Appendix R,'' the
memorandum said.

NRC APPROVES INDUSTRY GUIDELINE FOR MANAGING COMMITMENTS

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   Executive Director for Operations James Taylor signed a Secy information
paper December 20, approving a commitment management program developed by
the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI).
   Secy 95-300, a Secy paper that does not require commission action,
finalizes the agency's approval of NEI's guidance for managing NRC
commitments, said Gene Imbro, head of the Office of Nuclear Reactor
Regulation (NRR) regulatory review group and cost-beneficial licensing
action (CBLA) program. The Secy paper caps more than 20 months of joint
industry-NRC work to develop a way to help utilities manage the thousands
of commitments on the books and eliminate those no longer deemed
significant to safe plant operation.
   About half of the industry is already using the guidance, and they are
saving money, according to Stephen Floyd, NEI manager of special projects,
who developed the guidance document. Floyd said that some utilities have
estimated ``a couple million dollars already in direct savings,'' while
others have projected several million dollars in soft savings (INRC, 13
Nov. '95, 1).
   Imbro said the commission paper contains a letter that the agency plans
to send to NEI endorsing the use of the industry commitment management
guideline. NEI intends to send a copy of the letter to all nuclear
utilities, along with the guidance document.
   The average nuclear power plant has between 8,000 and 10,000 commitments
per unit. Currently, there is no uniform method used by utilities for
determining how to change or drop commitments, NRC staffers noted. Adoption
of the NEI guidance document would be entirely voluntary.

NRC ORDER BARRING MAINE YANKEE RESTART COULD BE CLEARED THIS MONTH

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A restart of Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co.'s Maine Yankee could still
come this month, plant officials say, despite an NRC order January 3
barring restart of the unit.
   Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Director William Russell issued the
order blocking Maine Yankee from restarting until it has satisfied certain
concerns about the safety analyses for the plant's emergency core cooling
system (ECCS) and containment.
   Once documentation is submitted to NRC addressing those initial
concerns, Maine Yankee will be allowed to start up. However, operation will
be restricted to 2,440-MW thermal, about a 10% derating, while NRC is
reviewing the material provided and until a new safety analysis for the
ECCS and containment is provided for operating at higher thermal power
levels.
   The plant's originally licensed thermal power is 2,440-MW thermal, but
NRC had granted it two power uprates in the 1980s. The unit was last
operating at 2,700-MW thermal.
   Maine Yankee spokesman Marshall Murphy said January 4 he expected the
plant would restart in ``the January time frame.''
   A planned restart in late December--after a one year outage to repair
steam generators--was derailed when an anonymous allegation was made that
the plant's safety analyses for ECCS and containment design were faulty
(INRC, 25 Dec. '95, 1).
   In its January 3 order, NRC said that it approved the use of the Yankee
Atomic Electric Co. (YAEC) version of a computer code, Relap5-YA, for
analyzing Maine Yankee's ECCS in 1989, but with ``twelve conditions,
including specifications for future plant specific licensing submittals,
justifying options taken and sensitivity studies performed.''
   NRC never followed up on the demands for information until after the
allegation was made December 4, 1995 and it found ``(t)his licensee has not
provided the justifications or submittals specified....''
   At a December 18 meeting at NRC, YAEC President Andrew Kadak said that
the material was held on site because, although the staff's safety
evaluation report called for submittals, a related NRC letter at the time
spoke of NRC audits. However, Maine Yankee spokesman Murphy could not
confirm that last week. Murphy said plant officials were still reviewing
the entire order, including ``taking a look at that language.''
   NRC noted that its order addresses only future operation and does not
address allegations related to violations of NRC requirements in the past,
including allegations of wrongdoing, which will be dealt with separately.
   According to the order, Maine Yankee must supply the following material
prior to restart:
   -- A description of evaluations that have been completed that provide
justification for the use of the current cycle's operating limits, as
established in the Cycle 15 Core Operating Limits Report, using methods
approved for Maine Yankee and without reliance on the Relap5-YA computer
code for small break loss-of-coolant accidents (SBLOCA) analysis and
assuming a reactor thermal rating of 2,440 MWt. Details related to analyses
performed, significant assumptions, and conclusions drawn shall be
provided.
   -- A description of all other applications where Relap5-YA is relied on
for Cycle 15 operation identifying the details of the application, and
conclusions drawn with respect to any facility modifications or procedure
changes. For each application, document the determination that operability,
as defined in Maine Yankee Technical Specifications, of affected
structures, systems and components is maintained. For plant procedures
required by Maine Yankee Technical Specifications that rely on Relap5-YA
analysis for operator action, document the determination as to why the
affected operator action continues to be appropriate or, if necessary,
evaluate the affected procedures in accordance with 10 CFR Section 50.59
and provide a summary of that evaluation. If any procedures are changed,
confirm that appropriate training has been provided.
   -- A description of measures taken to limit reactor operation to a
maximum thermal power of 2,440 MWt (90.37% of 2,700 MWt).
   -- A description of measures taken to limit containment internal
operating pressure to a maximum of 2 psig.
   Also, according to the order, Maine Yankee has 30 days to supply the
following information:
   -- A SBLOCA analysis that is specific to Maine Yankee for operation at
power levels up to 2,700 MWt. The analysis must meet the requirements of 10
CFR Section 50.46, ``Acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling systems
for light water nuclear power reactors,'' and NUREG-0737, ``Clarification
of TMI Action Plan Requirements,'' Items II.K.3.30 and 31, ``SBLOCA
Methods'' and ``Plant-specific Analysis,'' respectively, and NUREG-0737,
Item II.K.3.5, ``Automatic Trip of Reactor Coolant Pumps During LOCA.''
   -- An integrated containment analysis, accounting for relevant changes
to the facility (e.g., spray system changes, power uprates, and containment
maximum temperature and pressure changes), during a design basis accident
(DBA) that demonstrates the maximum calculated DBA containment pressure
meets the design basis pressure for Maine Yankee (55 psig). Assumptions
used for these analyses that are different from those specified in
Nureg-0800, the NRC Standard Review Plan, Section 6.2.1.1.A, shall be
described.

WHISTLE-BLOWERS SAY AGENCY SHOULD SUSPEND PLANT OPERATING LICENSES

By:
Dave Airozo Washington

   Two whistle-blowers locked in years-long battles with Georgia Power Co.
and the Southern Nuclear Operating Co. over alleged harassment want NRC to
immediately suspend the companies' nuclear plant operating licenses and
fine them more than $20-million because, the whistle-blowers say, the
discrimination by senior management continues.
   Late last week the whistle-blowers, Allen Mosbaugh and Marvin Hobby,
were expected to file a so-called 2.206 petition with NRC in which they
argue that the agency's own regulations require that the drastic action be
taken and the hefty fines meted out. They contend that senior managers of
the companies have repeatedly violated NRC whistle-blower protection
provisions and that the agency must escalate enforcement action.
   Last year, both Mosbaugh and Hobby won Department of Labor (DOL) cases
against the companies over alleged retaliation for whistle-blowing. In both
cases, Secretary of Labor Robert Reich directed the companies to reinstate
the men and ordered payment of other damages.
   In mid-December, Georgia Power filed a motion with DOL's Office of
Administrative Appeals asking that the record in the Mosbaugh case be
reopened and further hearings be held. In the motion, Georgia Power noted
that during the DOL proceeding, NRC's Office of Investigations had held on
to 76 tape recordings Mosbaugh had surreptitiously made of fellow employees
while he was assistant general manager of the Vogtle nuclear plant. OI used
the tapes recordings as part of its own investigation into Mosbaugh's
allegations of wrongdoing by Georgia Power management. The tapes were not
given to Georgia Power until after the record in the Labor proceeding was
closed, and Georgia Power now claims that the tapes contain significant
information that would have affected Reich's decision.
   Georgia Power also plans to appeal Reich's decision in the Hobby case
but the proceeding is in limbo at DOL because of the federal government's
budget crisis and resulting government employee furloughs, Georgia Power
spokesman Tal Wright said January 4.
   NRC is already considering ``escalated enforcement action'' because of
the Mosbaugh harassment case.
   In a draft of the 2.206 petition, the whistle-blowers note that Reich
specifically identified A.W. Dahlberg, former Georgia Power president and
now president, chief executive officer and chairman of the board of
Southern Co. as having had an ``active role'' in the ``illegal'' firings of
Hobby and Mosbaugh. They charge that the discrimination against Hobby and
Mosbaugh, and Georgia Power's refusal to reinstate them, continues to have
a ``chilling effect'' on Georgia Power and Southern Nuclear workers and
that the NRC should fine the companies $200,000 a day for each day that
Hobby and Mosbaugh are not reinstated.
   With the meter running from the date of Reich's decisions, the fine
would total $20-million as of January 4.
   In their petition, the whistle-blowers also note that George Hairston
and Kenneth McCoy, both Georgia Power senior managers, were involved in
providing NRC with inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the
equipment performance and test results following a 1990
loss-of-offsite-power incident at Vogtle (INRC, 20 Feb. '95, 8).
   The whistle-blowers suggest that the repeated involvement of senior
officials in these cases reveals a pattern of noncompliance with NRC
regulations and that the agency must impose strong sanctions, including the
suspension of the operating licenses until the alleged management problem
is corrected.
   NRC regulations (10 CFR Part 2) do call for progressively stiffer
enforcement actions for repeated violations of the same requirements within
a two-year period. The agency has already hit Georgia Power with a Severity
Level II violation and a $200,000 fine for supplying inaccurate and
incomplete information related to the Vogtle incident and, as noted above,
is considering more in response to the Mosbaugh case.
   Under the NRC guidelines, if a licensee is slapped with two Severity
Level II violations within the two-year period, suspension of affected
operations should be considered.
   ``The actual progression to be used in a particular case will depend on
the circumstances,' the regulations say. ``Enforcement sanctions will
normally escalate for recurring similar violations.''

FOUR UTILITIES EXPECT SAVINGS FROM JOINT STANDARD TECH SPEC SUBMITTAL

By:
Wilson Dizard III, Washington

   Four Region IV utilities expect savings that could range into the
millions of dollars from their banding together to submit their standard
technical specifications applications to NRC.
   Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E), Texas Utilities Electric Co. (TUEC),
Union Electric Co., and Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp. (WNOC) joined
forces late last year to coordinate their joint standard tech spec
conversion. The utilities presented their plans to NRC staff at a November
14 meeting.
   Roger Walker, manager of nuclear licensing for TUEC, told Inside N.R.C.
that the savings from the standard tech spec conversion process could run
between $1- and $4-million a year.
   Alan Passwater, licensing manager for Union Electric's Callaway, said
his utility earlier planned to conduct a joint standard tech spec submittal
with WNOC, because Wolf Creek and Callaway were built to the standard SNPPS
(Standardized Nuclear Power Plant System) design devised by Westinghouse in
the mid-1970s. Passwater said extending the joint standard tech spec
application to four utilities would likely save his utility $200,000.
   The four utilities all operate one nuclear station each. All of the
units are in NRC Region IV, and all are two-train, four-loop Westinghouse
units.
   Managers for the four utilities see the joint tech spec application as
the first of what could become several joint efforts in dealing with NRC.
   NRC has been pressing nuclear plant operators to adopt standard
technical specifications (INRC, 15 May '95, 8). NRC staff estimate that up
to 40% of the surveillances required under existing tech specs could be
eliminated under standard tech specs. By mid-1995, close to 50 plants had
committed formally to standard tech spec conversion.
   Walker said that the four utilities plan to submit their joint
application in December 1996. ``It's a long, elaborate process,'' Walker
said, noting that the application would run well into the hundreds of
pages.
   ``We did an economic estimate before we started,'' Walker said. ``We
estimated hard savings and soft savings.'' The hard savings flowed from
requirements that would be dropped, and the soft savings were estimated to
come from avoided plant shutdowns.
   ``The soft savings were much stronger than the hard savings,'' Walker
said.
   Walker noted that some procedure changes that would require tech spec
changes under current conditions could be handled through NRC's 50.59
process under the standard tech specs.
   Walker also expects faster service from NRC in any future tech spec
changes after the standard tech specs are adopted.
   Steve Wideman, supervisor of licensing for Wolf Creek, said the impetus
for the joint standard tech spec submittal flowed from senior management
meetings among the four utilities last summer. He noted the joint submittal
would also save the utilities some of the NRC review fees associated with
the process.
   Pat Nugent, tech spec supervisor for PG&E's Diablo Canyon, said, ``We
believe there is some economic benefit. Also, NRC has been pushing the
industry hard to go to standard tech specs.''
   The four utilities expect that NRC will take four to six months to
review their standard tech spec application, which takes the schedule out
to mid-1997. The new tech specs will be implemented in the middle of an
operating cycle at each unit, but the utilities have not reached that point
in their planning yet.
   Some of the utilities are in the process of seeking line item changes to
their existing tech specs, a process that NRC staff said would continue
while the joint standard tech specs are developed.
   NRC staff told the utilities at the November 14 meeting that the
application process could be accelerated if the applications were sent
electronically.

DUKE POWER

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   DUKE POWER EXPECTS TO SAVE $2.7-MILLION AT THE OCONEE NUCLEAR PLANT by
changing the qualified life of pressure transmitters installed in the
reactor containment buildings of the three units.
   The 105 pressure transmitters inside the containment buildings all had a
10-year qualified life, based on the assumption that they would be subject
to ambient temperatures of 120 degrees F. Robert Smith, an engineer at
Duke, who for years had been pushing to install temperature devices in the
containments to determine the real temperature, last year installed
temperature monitoring data loggers at Oconee.
   The actual ambient temperature level in the basement was only 80 degrees
F, which allowed Duke to change the qualified life of the transmitters, and
obviated the need to replace them for the remaining operating life of the
unit, Smith said. The idea to install the temperature devices grew out of a
program instituted at Duke Power three years ago to review the
environmental qualification (EQ) of electrical equipment coming up for a
changeout before each outage, he added.
   Duke is continuing to analyze electrical equipment based on the actual
temperatures in which they run and expects to save several hundred thousand
dollars--maybe close to $1-million--on replacement costs for changing other
electrical equipment, such as level switches and solenoid valves, said
Smith.
   The utility also ``is looking at installing temperature monitoring
equipment at Catawba and McGuire, where greater savings are projected,''
according to Duke spokesperson Rick Zuercher.

NRC, FEMA, INDUSTRY WORKING TO DEVELOP MORE REALISTIC EP DRILLS

By:
Tom Harrison, Washington

   The NRC is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
and industry organizations to develop more realistic emergency planning
(EP) drill scenarios that participants say will improve training and reduce
costs for plant owners.
   Members of the Realism in Scenarios Working Group include
representatives from the NRC, FEMA, the Institute of Nuclear Power
Operations (INPO), the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), and the Conference
of Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD).
   The idea originated with NRC senior management, who saw room for
improvement after participating in EP drills, said Aby Mohseni, NRC
emergency response coordinator.
   ``There are some good scenarios out there, but there are some that are
not as logical and coherent as others,'' he said.
   For example, a scenario might involve a plant having significant core
damage without major problems with core cooling, which is not possible.
   Or to test various parts of the plant in the drill, events could include
a plane crash, an earthquake, an on-site fire and several employees
suffering heart attacks--all within the space of a few hours.
   The NRC is searching its database to develop criteria for what makes a
good scenario, Mohseni said, and wants to have those attributes identified
within a couple of months.
   After that, the group, which held its first meeting in December, plans
to have a plant volunteer to test the criteria in an upcoming drill.
   The criteria aren't intended to become a regulation or increase costs,
and may eventually save money for utilities, he said.
   After the group develops a repository of scenarios, utilities will be
able to reuse them instead of having to come up with their own, he said.
   Every other year, each plant is required to hold a graded drill, which
is overseen and assessed by NRC officials. These biennial drills also
involve state and local governments, whose performance is evaluated by
FEMA.
   ``We've had 15 years of experience since TMI in doing the major
exercises,'' Mohseni said. ``Those 15 years have shed some light on where
we could get more benefit in training.''
   Plants also hold at least one emergency plan drill a year involving the
NRC and other outside agencies and conduct several drills annually on their
own.
   Costs for drills range from thousands of dollars to tens of thousands
depending on the number of people involved and the scope of the exercise.
   The biennial drills traditionally involve the release of enough
radioactivity to require several miles around the plant to be evacuated,
which allows FEMA to meet its requirements.
   Emergency planners say the scenarios are unrealistic because they have
to meet objectives set by the NRC and FEMA.
   ``You've got to break things in the plant that are almost beyond
belief,'' said Jim Weeks, manager of emergency planning at Wolf Creek.
   The scenarios also don't allow operators to be successful in solving
problems, he said.
   ``Operators know no matter what they do, they're going to go to a
general emergency,'' he said. ``From the operations people's point of view,
they're not getting much value out of it because they know they're not
going to be successful.''
   That results in negative training, said scenario group member Ron
Fraass, a public health physicist with the state of Kansas.
   ``It keeps control room operators from taking some ideas and running
with it,'' he said.
   Many utilities develop their own scenarios in-house. Paying a consultant
to devise a scenario can cost $60,000, according to industry estimates.

WORLD REGULATORS AGREE MORE WORK NEEDED TO LEAVE CIRC CRACKS IN PLACE

By:
Ann MacLachlan, Paris

   Significant improvements are needed in plugging criteria and crack
sizing before circumferentially cracked steam generator tubes can be left
in service, a group of experts from the nuclear industry, research and
regulatory bodies agreed late last year.
   Those improvements depend, in part, on a much broader base of experience
of past degradation, better understanding of why and how flaws develop, and
more robust nondestructive examination (NDE) tools and analysis methods.
   As for criteria used to determine response to axial cracking, the
experts found present voltage-based criteria acceptable for now, but said
the criteria have weaknesses that may be offset in the future by improved
technology for sizing cracks.
   In any case, the experts said, international collaboration is needed to
develop more realistic plugging criteria based on examination of pulled
tubes and laboratory-produced cracks.
   At an international workshop devoted to steam generator tube integrity,
sponsored by the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) and hosted by the NRC's
Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research at the Argonne National Laboratory
near Chicago, 100 experts from 15 countries explored the extent of
knowledge on different types of steam generator degradation.
   Much has been learned since the NEA's last steam generator meeting in
Brussels in 1991. But participants decided that because of the evolving
nature of tube degradation any definitive conclusions would be premature,
according to Jean-Pierre Clausner, the NEA staffer responsible for the
workshop.
   Reports on the meeting were presented late last year to the NEA's
Committee on Nuclear Regulatory Activities (CNRA) and to its Committee on
the Safety of Nuclear Installations (CSNI), sponsors of the workshop. The
experts' findings and recommendations were numerous and detailed, given
that they met in parallel sessions covering tube degradation, inspection,
integrity, preventive and corrective measures, and operational aspects of
risk analysis.

Group Recommends Pulling More Tubes
   According to a summary prepared for the CNRA/CSNI, several of the
workshop sessions highlighted the need to pull and examine for analysis
more tubes and tube/tube support plate assemblies from both operating and
retired steam generators. The examinations are considered key to defining
the precise conditions of crevice chemistry, developing better NDE
standards, providing prototype flaw specimens for integrity testing, and
evaluating such repair techniques as sleeving.
   The CNRA did not follow a recommendation from the Argonne meeting to
develop an international data base on tube pressure and leakage testing and
destructive examinations, Clausner said--not because it isn't needed, but
because the committee members felt such data would be very difficult for
regulators to gather because it belongs logically to the nuclear industry.
   On the other hand, he said, the committee recommended that the CSNI's
working group on component integrity intensify its monitoring of the
phenomena involved in steam generator tube degradation, permitting a more
complete review of the international situation within the next two years.
   The Argonne workshop agreed that circumferential and axial cracks in
steam generator tubes should continue to be treated separately with respect
to their impact on safety, according to the NEA summary. In general, better
inspection tools for early detection of stress corrosion cracking (SCC),
more experimental data on outer-diameter SCC crack initiation and growth,
improved monitoring instrumentation, and better understanding of local
stress/strain conditions are needed, as is a better correlation of
chemistry and microstructure with SCC susceptibility, the experts found.
   They agreed that periodic NDE is not very useful in detecting
fatigue-induced cracks, for which plants must depend on leak-before-break
methods to manage degradation. Greater attention is needed to processes
initiating at regions of mild deformation, such as denting and scratches,
they said, and the impact of tube support plate ligament cracking--now
observed at several plants, notably in France--is ``not thoroughly
understood,'' they said.
   Officials agreed that reliable crack detection and sizing are important
even if circumferentially cracked tubes are plugged on detection. The
detection threshold for circumferential cracks with eddy current testing is
only about 50% throughwall, pointing to the need for other NDE methods.
Ultrasonic techniques (UT) have potential, but ``there are problems with
false positive calls, and improvements are clearly needed,'' officials
said.
   Accurate sizing information is needed to develop data on crack growth
rate. However, sizing cracks is more difficult than detecting them, they
said.
   Robert Comby of Electricite de France's Central Laboratories (GDL), said
that only two of the countries participating in the Argonne workshop use
tube plugging criteria for circumferential cracking based on analysis, not
mere detection. They are Belgium and Canada. The Canadians plug the tubes
all the same, he said. Comby said very intricate work is used to analyze
outer-diameter circumferential cracking, which is ``very diverse'' in
nature and evolves in a way that is still poorly understood.
   One of the French participants, Guy Turluer of the Institute of Nuclear
Safety & Protection (IPSN), said that the dilemma highlighted by the
Argonne meeting was that ``few countries have feedback from operating
experience'' concerning circumferential cracking. ``We don't know the
nature of the corrosive environment. It's hard to reproduce in the
laboratory,'' he said.

No Consensus On Continued Use
   The Argonne workshop could reach ``no consensus on the question of
leaving tubes with circumferential cracks in service,'' the NEA summary
said. But the experts discussing tube integrity agreed that ``regulatory
requirements should be flexible to allow adapting to changing technology
and operating experience,'' for example to allow implementation of
degradation-specific management.
   Another group considered the status and efficacy of preventive and
corrective measures used to mitigate or overcome tube degradation. On the
issue of mechanical mitigation, they found that successful tube sleeving
``requires development of qualification guidelines and a procedure
checklist,'' observing that ``many early failures were associated with
application outside of the process window.''
   While sleeves can generally be adequately inspected, the group said that
integrity validation requires that sleeved tubes be removed and examined. 
Nickel-plating of the tubes, as used for example in Belgium, can be applied
at almost all tube locations. However, inspection of those tubes requires
UT rather than eddy current techniques.
   Direct tube repair by remelting and welding can be applied primarily at
tube support plate intersections, the group said, but it complicates
subsequent inspections because eddy current tests are not effective and the
rough surface makes UT more difficult. Shot- or roto-peening before service
guards well against primary water SCC, but post-service peening can at best
delay the onset of cracking, they said. The group recommended cold-leg
peening where PWSCC is the primary mode of tube degradation.
   To prevent degradation, workshop participants said, ``good sludge
control is essential.'' Steam generator crevice chemistry is still
inadequately characterized, ``making it difficult to evaluate water
chemistry remedies,'' they said. They recommended a significant steam
generator tube sampling program to increase knowledge about crevices.
   The ultimate remedy for tube degradation, steam generator replacement,
should be effective, they said, since new steam generator designs minimize
stresses and sludge buildup, and new alloys--690 and 800--should provide
sufficient protection against corrosion.
   Finally, the Argonne workshop agreed on the need to improve human
reliability information and methods used in probabilistic analysis of steam
generator tube rupture events. They approved the implementation of on-line
leakage monitoring, but called for improved correlation between leakage and
degradation for various tube degradation modes as well as for a more
refined technical basis for operational leakage limits. They also said the
role of steam generator tube degradation in overall plant risk should be
better appreciated.

GOOD MARKS FOR BEZNAU-1 AND -2 IN INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENT

By:
Laura Pilarski, Zurich

   Switzerland's 364-MW Beznau-1 and -2 have achieved an ``excellent''
record, said an IAEA Operational Safety Review Team (Osart) which completed
a three-week review December 1.
   Osarts compare performance to best international practices. The audit
was made at the request of the Swiss government in a general effort to
enhance operational nuclear safety and not because of any specific safety
concerns. An official Beznau report will be submitted to Bern in a few
months.
   Nordostschweizerische Kraftwerke AG (NOK), owner of the two PWRs, was
commended for several areas of performance, including having an experienced
and capable staff with a strong apprenticeship program; a commitment to
highest work quality standards, with good condition and cleanliness of
plant equipment; imbuing station management and staff with high goals; and
utilizing state-of-the-art safety analysis techniques to ensure high safety
standards are maintained.
   Among the Osart's proposals for improvement were: conducting reviews of
abnormal operating events in more depth and giving more attention to human
performance factors contributing to these events; providing improved
guidelines to examine plant conditions before returning to power operation
following reactor trips; strengthening management safety policies and
guidance to the staff; fostering a more self-questioning attitude among
staffers in performing plant activities; and increasing management
exchanges with nuclear power plants internationally.
   An Osart team will return to Beznau for a follow-up visit sometime in
1997. The Swiss review was the 86th plant reviewed in the Osart program.
The cost, which the owner and plant assume, is estimated at more than
1-million Swiss francs and includes all internal costs of special reports,
documentation, and files.
   Nuclear opponents in Switzerland tend to disparage Osart reviews, saying
they are not concerned with possible technical problems and plant design.

NEI WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH IN '96 FOR THERMO-LAG WAIVERS UNTIL NEW RULE

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) executive says the industry lobby
organization will continue to push NRC to waive certain fire protection
requirements on Thermo-Lag fire barriers until a new rule can be
developed.
   NRC Chairman Shirley Jackson told Inside N.R.C. November 15, 1995 that
she opposed the idea. It is an idea that has been floating around for a
long time, but was resurrected formally with NRC staff on November 8, 1995
by Bill Rasin, NEI vice president for technical issues.
   Despite Jackson's apparent opposition, NEI Executive Vice President Joe
Colvin said his organization would continue to push for that option in
1996.
   ``We have not given up on that approach,'' Colvin said. ``I think the
staff at the leadership level is receptive to this approach because they're
spending a lot of resources and we are too.''
   NEI would have to ``have communication with Chairman Jackson and
Commissioner Rogers and the senior staff'' about the issue, Colvin said in
remarks prior to Commissioner Greta Dicus' Senate confirmation.
   NEI is due to have a meeting with NRC senior staff on the issue this
month and a staff paper to the commission on Thermo-Lag resolution is
overdue.
   The problem of unqualified Thermo-Lag fire barriers dates back to
1991-92 and still remains, according to some estimates, years away from
resolution.
   The problem with the fire protection issues, Colvin said, particularly
Thermo-Lag is that ``it's not just a technical issue. It's not just a
licensing issue. It's got political overtones.''
   He said ``everyone agrees'' that the fire protection regulations require
adjustment so if the agency is going to change the regulations anyway, why
force compliance with the old ones in the interim when compensatory
measures taken are adequate to insure safety.
   Looking ahead to 1996, Colvin said he sees the industry-NRC relationship
as positive. He said a dialog has been opened up. The two parties are
comparing notes as to what their respective priorities are to make best use
of both industry and NRC resources. One of the most positive signs, Colvin
said, is that the dialog with NRC is now ``engaged at the EDO level'' and
includes the office heads.
   One of the most often cited past successes of industry/NRC cooperation
has been the maintenance rule. When it came to developing the regulatory
guidance for the maintenance rule, which takes effect in July, senior
industry officials and senior NRC officials sat down to iron out the
guidance. The result was considered a success by both sides and yet ``the
maintenance rule approach'' has been unsuccessful when applied elsewhere.
   It was first tried on the license renewal rule and ``it didn't work,''
there, Colvin said. Then, it was tried on the maintenance rule and ``it
worked tremendously (well).''
   Then it was tried on graded quality assurance (QA) and it didn't work,
Colvin said. ``It's people and perception driven.'' All these issues,
particularly the QA, is ``talking about changing the way people do things.
That makes people nervous--at both utilities and NRC,'' he said.
   One advantage with the use of the approach on the maintenance rule, was
that NRC didn't use outside contractors and high-level staffers
participated in themeetings and made decisions, Colvin said. It was the
strong leadership from both the industry and agency side that made the
difference, he said.
   He said NEI would be continuing to try to use the maintenance rule model
of looking at systems, structures and components and their risk and try to
apply that in other contexts in 1996.
   The failure, so far, of the graded QA effort Colvin said it is ``very
difficult to get the mindset changed. The QA infrastructure runs long and
deep in the industry and in NRC. It's almost sacred. There's a lot of
emotion you got to get through before you can get down to details.''

CRITICS FEAR ANOTHER `BROWNS FERRY' AS NRC OKAYS COMBUSTIBLE FIRE STOPS

By:
David Stellfox, Washington

   A silicone foam or elastomer sealant material--used to block the spread
of fires at the soon-to-be licensed Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Watts
Bar plant--is combustible and prone to ``deep-seated fires,'' NRC says.
   Nonetheless, the agency said the material is an ``acceptable deviation''
from requirements limiting fire stops to noncombustible materials.
   The antinuclear group Nuclear Information & Resource Service (NIRS) and
a private fire protection engineer contend that the NRC violated federal
law when it authorized the use of the admittedly combustible fire seals at
Watts Bar.
   Four years before the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island-2, TVA's Browns
Ferry plant had a near meltdown after a fire started in a penetration seal
made of combustible urethane. Penetration seals are used to stop a fire
from spreading from one room or fire area to another.
   But at Browns Ferry, the fire quickly spread through electrical control
equipment, disabling systems needed to safely shut off the nuclear chain
reaction. That near disaster led to the creation of NRC's current fire
protection requirements that call for the use of noncombustible materials.
   The NRC staff decision that Watts Barr could use combustible silicone
materials to seal penetrations through fire walls and floors has alarmed
nuclear watchdogs. NIRS wrote to NRC Chairman Shirley Jackson saying that
Watts Bar should be denied a full-power operating license because it does
not meet fire protection requirements. The commission is expected to issue
the full-power license to Watts Bar within a few weeks.
   Jackson would not comment on the issue, and staffers in her office
referred inquiries to the NRC Public Affairs Office. Agency spokesman Joe
Gilliland said that, as of January 4, no official response had been made to
NIRS.
   In a letter to Jackson in late December, NIRS said it was ``ironic''
that NRC would consider licensing a TVA plant with combustible penetration
seals 20 years after a fire at another TVA plant prompted the agency to
adopt fire protection rules specifically to bar the use of such material.
   Equally ironic, nuclear watchdogs said, is that the argument NRC staff
used to justify use of the seals is remarkably similar to an argument it
recently rejected for an unrelated fire protection material.
   That fire barrier material, known as Thermo-Lag, is used to protect
electrical cables and components used to shut down reactors.
   The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), the nuclear industry trade
association, tried unsuccessfully to claim that Thermo-Lag was
noncombustible using arguments similar to what NRC used to accept the
combustible penetration seals.
   Gerald Brown, a Minneapolis-based fire protection engineer, claimed that
by waiving requirements on penetration seals, NRC is trying to avoid an
expensive drain on both industry and NRC resources.
   Other industry sources say privately that NRC treated Thermo-Lag more
strictly because Thermo-Lag had become a political problem for them,
particularly after a congressional hearing in 1993. Problems with fire
barrier penetration seals have not gotten the same level of public
attention.
   It was Brown's 1991 allegations on Thermo-Lag that prompted a wholesale
upheaval in nuclear industry fire protection programs. His 1991 allegations
were confirmed by NRC and led the agency to disqualify all prior testing of
Thermo-Lag and to declare all those barriers inoperable--a matter still
unresolved five years later.
   As a fire protection consultant, Brown potentially stands to gain
business from utilities upgrading fire protection programs and equipment.
   Brown said the nuclear power industry, in attempting to requalify
Thermo-Lag in the last five years, wanted to claim that the material was
``noncombustible.'' They did so with the argument that given the difficulty
of igniting the material, the location in the plant, and the absence of any
other combustibles to start or feed a fire, Thermo-Lag was ``effectively''
noncombustible.
   NRC rejected that argument (INRC, 3 April '95, 3), but then turned
around and used a remarkably similar approach to justify the use of
combustible fire penetration seals at Watts Bar, Brown said. ``That's
ludicrous. It's a double standard, and it's against the law.''
   NRC's Conrad McCracken, the plant systems branch chief in the Office of
Nuclear Reactor Regulation, doesn't deny that the silicone seals are
combustible. McCracken couldn't be reached for comment, but in a December
21 response letter to Paul Gunter of NIRS, McCracken wrote: ``The NRC staff
acknowledges that silicone foam and silicone elastomer penetration seal
materials are combustible as defined by NRC fire protection guidance.''
   However, McCracken wrote Gunter that the seal material does provide some
protection; it acts as a sacrificial material and is accepted in many
non-nuclear applications. Incidentally, the same is true of Thermo-Lag.
   The seal material ``make up a relatively small contribution to the
overall combustible load...are usually distributed throughout the fire
area, as opposed to representing concentrations of combustibles, and are
difficult to ignite,'' McCracken wrote. Finally, McCracken concluded the
use of the silicone seals ``is an acceptable deviation from the penetration
seal guidance in Nureg-0800.''
   In a separate response to an e-mail allegation from Brown, McCracken
acknowledged that a fire ``may become deep-seated within the penetration.''
Brown says this makes it appear the fire has been extinguished when deep
inside the seal it is still burning.
   The NRC's fire protection requirements are prescriptive, Brown said. Is
the material combustible or isn't it? he asked. To say it is combustible
but that's an acceptable deviation is not prescriptive regulation, Brown
said. ``That's a performance-based answer,'' he said. NRC has so far
refused industry attempts to resolve problems with Thermo-Lag by using
performance-based approaches, Brown noted, and now the NRC is turning
around and using a performance-based approach for penetration seals.
   Besides the apparent double standard, Brown maintained NRC cannot
legally make an acceptable deviation on the penetration seals. He said that
unlike the situation with Thermo-Lag, penetration seals are specifically
addressed in the federal Code of Federal Regulations. Brown added that NRC
does not have the right to waive federal law but can only promulgate new,
superseding law. For Thermo-Lag, the requirements are in subsidiary
guidance documents giving NRC greater flexibility in interpretation and
enforcement.
   But penetration seals are specifically addressed in 10 CFR Part 50,
Appendix R, Section M, which says, in part: ``Penetration seal designs
shall utilize only noncombustible materials and shall be qualified by tests
that are comparable to tests used to rate fire barriers.''
   Brown, who also filed allegations over the penetration seals, claimed
NRC has been ignoring problems with the seals. Many of the problems related
to seals with voids and gaps and other issues are contained in NRC's own
files, and others were documented in a series of Inside N.R.C. articles in
1994 (INRC, 19 Sept. '94, 1 and INRC, 17 Oct. '94, 1).
   Thousands of similar silicone foam or elastomer seals are installed in
nuclear units across the country.
   In addition to their combustibility, questions have been raised about
the effectiveness of the seals. Penetration seal problems related to
installation, testing, documentation and poor maintenance, go back at least
15 years and rival problems associated with the controversial Thermo-Lag
material.
   In 1987 NRC drafted guidance on penetration seals intended to clarify
what was needed to qualify a seal. The guidance was leaked to industry
officials, then mysteriously dropped from the regulatory agenda and was
never issued (INRC, 6 March '95, 1). NRC officials have claimed the
penetration seal requirements in the leaked document were incorporated into
other NRC regulations, but industry sources have strongly disputed that.
The question has never been resolved.
   Brown said the NRC simply doesn't want to face up to the problems with
penetration seals so ``they are carefully selecting regulations (to
enforce) to suit the industry. This is the most flagrant and fraudulent
example.''

DICUS TO ASSUME DUTIES AS COMMISSIONER IN FEBRUARY, RESTORING QUORUM

By:
Kathleen Hart, Washington

   The Senate confirmed Greta Joy Dicus as an NRC commissioner December 22,
paving the way for restoring a three-person quorum to the commission.
   Dicus, who is director of the Division of Radiation Control & Emergency
Management at the Arkansas Department of Health, said that she hopes to be
ready to assume her duties as commissioner in early February. ``I have a
lot of goals I hope to accomplish in my time on the commission, but I want
to get up there and get a staff together before I get into those goals,''
she told Inside N.R.C. January 4.
   Dicus' term runs through June 30, 1998. No date has been set yet for an
official swearing-in ceremony.
   The commission has been acting without a quorum since July 1, 1995 when
Gail de Planque left after her five-year term as a commissioner ended and
Ivan Selin quit as chairman a year early. Currently, Chairman Shirley
Jackson is making commission decisions--in consultation with Commissioner
Kenneth Rogers--under an arrangement of ``delegated authority'' approved by
the commission when it still had four members.
   Clinton nominated Dicus July 14, 1995 to fill a third seat on the
commission. Dicus faced no opposition in the Senate Environment & Public
Works Committee, which approved her nomination September 19 (INRC, 2 Oct.
'95, 15). The fast-track nomination process stalled, however, when Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) made it clear to the White House that
he would not schedule a confirmation vote until President Clinton sent to
the Senate an intent to nominate a Republican to the five-member
commission.
   Ultimately, Dole relented and allowed the confirmation to go forward. A
White House staffer said January 2 that the administration is ``looking at
other candidates'' to fill the remaining two seats on the commission, but
has sent no names to the Senate since the Dicus nomination.
   Dicus was among more than 65 executive nominations cleared for a Senate
vote on December 22. Charles William Burton of Texas was confirmed as a
member of the board of the U.S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC) for a term
that lasts only until February 24. Kathleen McGinty of Pennsylvania was
confirmed as chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality.
   There had been speculation on the Hill that Dole let the nominations go
through to avoid the need to have the names all renominated in the second
session of the Congress. Because of the ongoing budget problems, however,
the first session of the 104th Congress was declared over, sine die, at
11:55 a.m. January 3. The second session began at noon.
   Dicus served as a member of the USEC board for a one-year term that
ended in March 1995. She is a member of the Conference of Radiation Control
Program Directors (CRCPD) and was elected chairman of the CRCPD in 1993.
Dicus, who has served as Arkansas liaison to the NRC, received her B.A.
from Texas Woman's University in Denton, Texas in 1961 and an M.A. in
radiation biology from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School
at Dallas in 1967.

Number Of Secy Papers, Commission Meetings Down
   The commission continued a downward trend in the number of Secy papers
handled in 1995. The staff produced 310 Secy papers last year, down
slightly from the 315 papers in 1994, and down significantly from the 360
papers produced in 1993.
   Also, there were fewer commission meetings last year than in the
previous year, according to Andrew Bates, senior level adviser to the
secretary of the commission. There were 86 commission meetings held in
1995, compared with 92 meetings in 1994. Fifty-two of the 86 meetings took
place in the first half of 1995, and 34 meetings in the second half.
   Part of the reason for the decline in the number of meetings can be
attributed to the fact that there have only been two commissioners since
July 1, 1995, and the staff has tried not to schedule commission meetings
when one of them is away or on leave.
   The schedule for commission briefings for the month of January is very
light. Except for one briefing on industry restructuring scheduled for
January 5, the calendar is empty until the end of the month. On January 30,
a briefing by DOE on the high-level waste program has been tentatively
scheduled. The periodic briefing on operating reactors and fuel facilities
meeting on is tentatively set for January 31.

Watts Bar-1 Full Power License Briefing Still On Hold
   A commission briefing on the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar-1
full power license--one of the most important decisions facing the
commission in some time--could be put off until after Dicus is sworn in as
a commissioner and a legal quorum is restored.
   The NRC announced December 20 that a planned January 5 commission
briefing on the license would be rescheduled.
   NRC staffers said January 2 that a commission briefing on the Watts
Bar-1 license had been set tentatively for January 31, three days after
Rogers returns from a personal trip, but before Dicus's presumed
swearing-in at the beginning of February (Nucleonics Week, 4 Jan., 3).
However, NRC spokesperson Joe Gilliland said January 4 that a commission
briefing had not yet been set--even tentatively--on the matter. ``That date
may have just been set as a working assumption for the staff,'' Gilliland
said.
   Delaying a vote on the license would avoid a possible legal challenge to
a commission decision approving Watts Bar's full-power operation. A lawsuit
already is pending challenging the delegated authority procedure under
which Jackson has exercised the full power of the commission for six
months. In that case, intervenors challenging the Trump-S nuclear research
project at the University of Missouri sued over the procedure (INRC, 13
Nov. '95, 5).

NRC LAST MONTH TURNED DOWN A SUBMITTAL

   THE NRC LAST MONTH TURNED DOWN A SUBMITTAL BY PENNSYLVANIA POWER & LIGHT
Co. (PP&L) seeking a change in the quality assurance program. The change
request was submitted as a cost-beneficial licensing action (CBLA), but NRC
staffers said that changes to the quality assurance plan under 10 CFR
50.54(a) are not considered eligible for CBLAs.
   ``The submitted change proposes an elimination of the biennial procedure
review requirements for plant emergency operating procedures, off normal
procedures, emergency operating procedures, and other procedures of which
usage may be dictated by event,'' Michael Modes, chief of civil, mechanical
and materials engineering branch in the Division of Reactor Safety, wrote
in a December 15, 1995 letter to Robert Byram, senior vice president,
nuclear, of PP&L.
   Modes said the proposed change is a ``reduction in the commitment
previously accepted by the NRC,'' and added that if the change has already
been implemented, ``you must cease implementation.''

NRC NOTES IMPROVEMENTS, PERSISTENT PERSONNEL ERRORS AT FITZPATRICK

   The New York Power Authority received Category 2 ratings in all four
functional areas in NRC's latest systematic assessment of licensee
performance (SALP) at FitzPatrick. NRC Region I Administrator Thomas Martin
said NRC found good coordination and communication between plant and
corporate groups. He said, however, that despite some improvements as a
result of a number of initiatives, ``persistent personnel errors across
multiple parts of the organization demonstrated the need for continued
management attention.''
   According to Nucleonics Week, FitzPatrick, an 849-MW BWR, had a gross
capacity factor in 1994 of 69.25%. Through October 1995, the capacity
factor was 61.27%.
   In his letter to the utility, Martin noted the effectiveness of NYPA's
response to individual plant events and problems. He added, however, that
there were continued instances of ``a lack of a broad approach to event
investigations and root-cause determinations.''

NRC FINDS `SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT' IN OPERATIONS AT COMANCHE PEAK

   TU Electric received top Category 1 ratings in three functional
areas--operations, maintenance, and plant support--and a Category 2 rating
in the area of engineering in NRC's latest SALP review at Comanche Peak.
   NRC Region IV Administrator L.J. Callan said the utility's ``superior
performance in the operations area represented a significant improvement
and was marked by a strong safety focus, clear management support for
operations, effective communication of management expectations, and strong
management involvement in operator training.'' Callan, however, also noted
a decline in performance in the engineering area. The SALP board, Callan
said, ``considered the examples of less than thorough and timely evaluation
of problems which affect operations and the instances where equipment
performance information was not effectively tracked and used to improve
reliability by predicting and preventing challenges to the plant, including
those introduced from the balance-of-plant.''
   According to Nucleonics Week, Comanche Peak-1 and -2, both 1,161-MW
Westinghouse PWRs, had gross capacity factors in 1994 of 95.98% and 54.76%,
respectively. Through October 1995, the capacity factors were 78.48% and
94.40%, respectively.
   In the area of maintenance, Callan said NRC found ``an improvement in
plant material condition, the absence of significant maintenance worker
induced plant challenges, the reduction in the maintenance backlog, and a
healthy customer service philosophy.''

NRC FOUND CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE

   NRC FOUND CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE OPERATIONS AREA AT
LIMERICK in a plant performance review (PPR) done December 5, 1995. NRC,
however, said that it was concerned about four scrams between August 8 and
September 11, 1995, as well as other transients experienced during the last
six months. In a letter to PECO Energy, NRC's Wayne Lanning, deputy
director of the division of reactor projects, noted that the utility's
``reviews have not found common contributing root causes, but we have noted
that you have developed a Focus on Excellence Through People Program to
address broad issues.''
   The PPR process consists of a review of inspection findings, significant
events and other information related to the integrated performance at a
nuclear plant. The purpose of the PPR process, NRC says, it to assess
performance trends and to plan future inspection activities. Another PPR
will occur later in the SALP cycle at Limerick, NRC said.

COOPER COMPLETES OUTAGE 22 DAYS LATE

   Major modifications to emergency diesel generators at Cooper last month
added another 22 days to the plant's refueling outage, costing the Nebraska
Public Power District (NPPD) roughly $2.2-million. The plant ended the
77-day refueling outage, which also included an in-service inspection of
the reactor vessel, on December 27.
   Terrence Reis, acting chief of reactor projects in NRC Region IV, said
last week that NPPD modified the diesel generators from a design that
needed a continuous supply of air to run to one that only needed an air
supply to start, similar to those used at all other nuclear generating
units in the U.S. Officials at both NRC and NPPD touted the modification as
one that would enhance plant safety. Cooper, once considered a
trouble-prone plant, is making a turn-around, according to NRC officials.
Reis said that NPPD officials admit that they underestimated the complexity
of the diesel generator modifications. He added that after some significant
problems with the work that NPPD quality assurance officials got very
``aggressive,'' making the modifications on the second generator go a lot
smoother.
   The diesel generator modifications, said Reis, are not related to the
Appendix R fire protection work done earlier. In November, NPPD crews found
that diesel generator modifications done in 1994 to meet NRC fire
protection rules actually would have made that equipment inoperable during
a control room fire (Nucleonics Week, 30 Nov. '95, 8). Crews had
incorrectly wired the control panel when they installed fuses in 1994 to
isolate five of the diesel generator indications on the control room
panel.

THREE UTILITIES SLAPPED WITH $50,000 FINES

   NRC started the new year by announcing $50,000 fines against each of
three utilities: Commonwealth Edison Co. (CECO), Baltimore Gas & Electric
Co. (BG&E), and the New York Power Authority (NYPA).
   NRC said that CECO had failed to correct a potential problem with
circuit breaker settings at Quad Cities. Managers at Quad Cities had been
told of a potential problem with the circuit breakers based on an incident
at CECO's Dresden plant, but failed to act, NRC said. The utility now is
planning plant modifications and procedure changes at Quad Cities.
   NRC staff identified a violation at BG&E's Calvert Cliffs involving lax
controls on unescorted access to the plant. A contractor employee was
granted unescorted access to the plant even though security staff at
Calvert Cliffs knew that the worker had been arrested under a different
name, NRC said. The worker's unescorted access permission later was revoked
when federal officials told BG&E that he was an illegal alien who had
fraudulently applied for a U.S. passport under another false name.
   NYPA was cited for four violations at Indian Point-3. The lapses
involved an October 15, 1995 incident in which the unit was taken from cold
shutdown to hot shutdown while switches controlling recirculation and
containment spray pumps were in the wrong position.
   The utilities have until February 1 to pay or contest the fines.
