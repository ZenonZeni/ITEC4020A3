<H2><CENTER>Lung cancer causing carcinogen<BR>
more prevalent in marijuana<BR>
than in tobacco.</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
A breakthrough report published in the journal Science, October 18, 1996,<BR>
provides the first true molecular evidence conclusively linking components
in<BR>
tobacco smoking to lung cancer. A chemical found in tobacco smoking,<BR>
benzopyrene, causes genetic damage in lung cells that is identical to the<BR>
damage observed in the DNA of most malignant tumors of the lungs.<BR>
<BR>
Although scientists have been convinced in the past that smoking causes
lung<BR>
cancer, the strong statistical associations did not provide absolute proof.<BR>
This paper absolutely pinpoints that mutations in lung cancer cells are
caused by<BR>
benzopyrene. <BR>
<BR>
An average marijuana cigarette contains 30 nanograms of this carcinogen,<BR>
compared to 21 nanograms in an average tobacco cigarette <A HREF="mj.html">(Marijuana
and<BR>
Health, National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine report, 1982)</A>.<BR>
This potent carcinogen suppresses a gene that controls growth of cells.
When this<BR>
gene is damaged, the body becomes more susceptible to cancer. This gene,<BR>
P53, is related to half of all human cancers and as many as 70% of lung<BR>
cancers.<BR>
<BR>
Clearly marijuana smoke contains more of the potent carcinogen benzopyrene<BR>
than tobacco smoke. Furthermore, the technique of smoking marijuana by<BR>
inhaling deeply and holding the smoke within the lungs presents a chance
of<BR>
much greater exposure than a conventional tobacco cigarette.<BR>

Dr. Bennett, who is listed in &quot;BEST DOCTORS IN AMERICA,&quot; states,
&quot;The idea of<BR>
using smoked marijuana containing these carcinogens as medicine, particularly<BR>
for patients who have suppressed immune systems like those with AIDS, should<BR>
be unthinkable. Thus, prior to considering marijuana as medicine, one must<BR>
abide by the old edict, &quot;first do no harm.&quot;<BR>
