<b><i>Making Your Fertility Treatment Plan:</i></b></H2><h2><b>Finding the Right Doctor<hr></b></h2>

Shelley looked toward me. "Dr. Perloe, how can couples find out which doctor to go to?"<P>
"There are a number of alternatives. Resolve's list of physicians is an excellent beginning." I paused. "However, one thing that concerns me greatly is the thinking that says that <I>only</I> a fertility specialist can treat fertility problems. That simply is not true."<P>
"But I wasted over a year going to my gynecologist before I realized he was just bouncing from one thing to another," Shelley said.  <P>
"I know that can happen. But even a fertility specialist may use hit-or-miss procedures. You see, there is nothing to prevent any doctor from hanging up a shingle that says 'fertility specialist.' "<P>
"I didn't know that," Debbie said.<P>
"First consult with your family physician or obstetrician-gynecologist. She or he knows your medical history better than anyone. If your problem requires specialized knowledge, ask your doctor to refer you to a specialist.<P>
"Read everything you can about fertility problems and fertility treatment. Talk to RESOLVE members and other infertile couples about their experiences and compare what's happening to you with what you learn. Talk to your doctor. Discuss your treatment plan and ask lots of questions. If it seems to you that your doctor does not have a plan, is not using 'accepted' procedures, or resents answering your questions, you may want to seek a second opinion."<P>
"What if you don't have a doctor?" a woman across the room asked.<P>
"Get a list of names in your area from the American Society of Reproductive Medicine or your local county medical society. Call or write fertility clinics for additional information. Talk to family and friends, too. Perhaps they know someone who's seeing a doctor for fertility treatment. With one in six couples in the United States seeking treatment for fertility problems, help can't be too far away. The best insurance you can have is being prepared_by reading attending workshops, and joining support groups."<P>
In this chapter I will tell you how to find a physician, what types of physicians or clinics to look for, and how to spot the "poor treatment" danger signs.<P>
<hr><h2 align=center>How to Find a Doctor</h2>

<b>Consult Your Current Physician First</b><br>

I encourage you to consult your family practice physician or obstetrician-gynecologist first. Since you've already developed a rapport, it will be easier for you to share personal and intimate facts about your sexual history and habits. Both of these physicians are trained to analyze the results from a semen analysis, blood tests, and X rays. And they know how to administer fertility treatment to both men and women. The following is a more detailed breakdown of different medical specialties.<p>


<b>Doctors Who Treat Fertility Problems</b><br>

<i>General Practitioner, Family Physician, Internal Medicine Specialist</i><BR>
Family physicians can assess your general health and investigate the potential effects of your medical history, environment, and medications on your fertility. These physicians can determine if a woman is ovulating and if a man's semen is functional. Many common fertility problems may be resolved at this initial level--for example, using a basal body temperature chart to time coitus, changing blood pressure medication, and counseling on the discontinuance of sperm-killing douches and lubricants. If your fertility problem is such that it demands it, your physician should refer you to a specialist. Since your records and test results will be provided to the specialist, you won't have wasted your money by seeing your family doctor first.<p>

<I>Obstetrician Gynecologist</I><BR>
This physician specializes in the study and treatment of women's diseases especially of the genitourinary and rectal tracts. In addition, he or she is concerned with the care and treatment of women during pregnancy and childbirth. Most OB-GYNs, as they are commonly called, also perform surgery. However, depending on their skills, they may or may not be able to perform microsurgery on your fallopian tubes, which is required in about 10 percent of fertility patients. Most OB-GYNs can perform a diagnostic laparoscopy, but if they can't do microsurgery, the laparoscopy may have to be repeated by the microsurgeon so he or she can plan your corrective surgery. OB-GYNs have access to all of the fertility diagnostic tests available including the semen analysis. The OB-GYN should be able to treat anovulation with clomiphene and to perform artificial insemination.<P>

<I>Reproductive Endocrinology and Fertility Specialist</I><BR>
This is an American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology subspecialty for OB-GYNs who receive extra fellowship training in the endocrinology of women (the study of hormones) and infertility. Generally these physicians are affiliated with fertility research programs at universities, infertility clinics, or in vitro fertilization centers. They have the most up-to-date information on fertility and are skilled in microsurgery techniques. By providing a full range of infertility treatments, the reproductive endocrinologist can work with you to develop a cost effective treatment plan offering you the greatest chance for success. The reproductive endocrinology practice often provides financial counseling to enable you to better plan ahead and make insurance decisions.  <P>

<I>Urologist</I><BR>
This physician specializes in the male genitourinary tract. The urologist can perform a semen analysis and can examine a man for a varicocoele, endocrine problems, genetic defects, or other physical abnormalities that may cause fertility problems. In addition, the urologist can perform a testicular biopsy, surgery for varicocoele repair, and vasectomy reversal.<P>

<I>Andrologist</I><BR>
This physician-scientist performs laboratory evaluations of male fertility. The andrologist need not be a medical doctor and may hold a Ph.D. degree in any number of technical areas, including microbiology, biochemistry, or andrology. Many andrologists are affiliated with fertility treatment centers and play a key role in performing in vitro fertilization.<P>

<I>Psychologist/Counselor</I><BR>
This healthcare professional can help you better communicate your feelings and needs to your spouse, family, friends and co-workers. An infertility counselor can help you plan to deal with stress you may encounter during treatment or explore ethical issues surrounding your chosen therapy.<p>
<B>Accept Your Physician's Referral</b><br>
If you trust your doctor, you'll be inclined to trust the quality of the referral. Referral from another physician is one of the quickest and best ways to find a doctor.<P>

<B>Starting Your Search from Scratch</B><BR>

If you're faced with finding a new physician on your own, you may want to utilize some of these resources:<BR><UL>

<LI><I><a href="resolve.html">RESOLVE, Inc.</a></I> Contact your local RESOLVE, Inc., chapter or national RESOLVE, Inc., for a referral.</li><P>
<LI><I>The American Society of Reproductive Medicine and local county medical society.</I> As noted, these organizations can provide you with a list of physicians who have expressed an interest in fertility treatment. Although membership in these organizations doesn't certify fertility treatment competency, this may be a good list to work from.</li><P>
<LI><I>Fertility clinics.</I> A number of fertility clinics exist across the country. Some of them are for-profit clinics. Others are nonprofit research organizations usually associated with universities. Many of these clinics can perform your fertility workup. If not, they can provide you with a list of physicians whom they work with in your community. Later I will discuss the different types of fertility clinics.</li><P>
<LI><I><A HREF="endoassn.html">The Endometrioisis Association</a></I> can provide referral to local physicians experienced in managing endometriosis related infertility.</ul>

<B>Should You Go to a Specialist?</b><BR>

Through your reading and search for information, you may have noticed that many sources recommend you avoid your family physician and obstetrician-gynecologist and go directly to a fertility specialist. I have heard couples say, "If you go to the in vitro clinic for your workup, you're getting the best." While it is certainly true that you can receive very good care through these facilities, the erroneous conclusion drawn by some couples is: "If you don't go to the in vitro center, you're settling for second best." Or even worse: "If the in vitro center can't help you, that's the final word."<P>
You may also have heard that you can identify a fertility specialist by the fact that he or she "specializes" in fertility and <I>doesn't deliver babies</I>_the logic apparently being that if doctors are busy delivering babies, they're too busy to know enough about fertility to practice it. I don't believe this is an adequate description, however, of a physician who is qualified to treat your fertility problem. So for a number of reasons, which I'll share with you, I disagree with this generalized recommendation for fertility specialists.<P>
<I>Any physician can be listed as a fertility specialist</i>. There is no regulation, licensing, or certification required for advertising this specialty. Before you make your first appointment, however, you can inquire if the physician is <I>fellowship-trained</I> in the reproductive endocrinology and infertility subspecialty.<p>
<I>Membership in the American Society of Reproductive Medicine is available to any physician showing an interest in the specialty</I>. While membership in this organization does not guarantee a known standard of technical competence, it does demonstrate the physician's interest in fertility treatment (a definite plus)
<I>Specialists may charge more for the same services.</I> An article in Money magazine stated that fertility specialists may charge up to five times more than nonspecialists. This may be overstated, but before you settle on the physician you want, ask about the charges for common tests and procedures. You may find that you'll pay twenty to twenty-five dollars more for a semen analysis from a specialist, even though the same medical laboratory provides these services to all of the doctors in your community. While a fertility specialist may charge more for a particular test or surgical procedure, that your treatment costs no more. A reproductive endocrinologist can best determine whether surgery or in vitro is a more cost effective option for you and help you develop a treatment plan that avoids wasting time and money on unecssary testing and outdated treatments. Do a little price comparison first and remember that the lowest- or highest-priced doctor is not necessarily the worst or best. <P>

<B>The Private Physician vs. the Fertility Clinic</B><BR>
Another question that arises is whether to consult with a private physician or go to a large fertility clinic. A private physician can treat most fertility problems. The additional skills and expertise provided by in vitro centers and large fertility clinics are needed only for about 10 percent of fertility problems. I have some additional ideas on this matter that I'd like to share with you:<P>
<I>For-profit fertility clinics and in vitro centers are not certified</I>. Fertility treatment has become a big money making business. It's little wonder that the clinic's interest in attracting customers influences the way in which they may report their pregnancy success rates. For example, a clinic may report that 50 percent of their patients get pregnant within two cycles. So you may assume that you have a one in two chance of pregnancy if you go to them. These could look like pretty good odds to some couples. However, the clinic's statistics do not show that they eliminate more than half of the applicants before completing the in vitro procedures. In fact, some clinics quote success rates based on a positive pregnancy test rather than babies delivered. the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology publishes an annual clinic specific report documenting success rates at each clinic. While this report ensures that each clinic defines success in a similar fashion, it may still not provide all the information you need to base your decision. At first glance, a program with a high success rate may seem the obvious choice. But, after a closer look, you learn that the clinic with a lower success rate treats older patients with more severe fertility problems while the clinic with the better pregnancy rates refuses women older than 35 and any couple with an abnormal semen analysis. Don't get me wrong: Reviewing statistics is important. Just try to be objective when you read or hear about success rates.<P>
<I>Research-oriented clinics may perform unnecessary tests and procedures to meet research criteria and to pay their expenses</I>. In order to conduct scientifically sound fertility research, medical professionals must have similar information about each couple. Thus this kind of clinic may perform expensive tests not only on patients who warrant them but also on those who do not need them. In this way the researchers can compare their results between "abnormal" and "normal" populations. Consequently the research clinic may not tailor your workup to your unique set of problems. Money charged for these "extra" tests also helps pay the bills for expensive laboratory and research capabilities which may not be needed for your basic diagnostic workup. Before signing up with a research clinic, find out what diagnostic procedures they recommend and how much they charge. If this information doesn't correlate with what you've learned about fertility treatment, you may wish to get a second opinion.<P>
<I>Larger clinics may contribute to your feeling of isolation and anonymity.</i> Often couples who have gone to large clinics complain that they didn't receive much of the physician's personal time; no one in the clinic knew them by sight; and a different resident physician saw them at each visit. Also, many people who travel considerable distances to these clinics don't feel comfort-able expressing their concerns: they feel isolated and dissatisfied. One patient said, "I feel like I'm being herded like cattle." If that's the way you feel, you probably are not getting the personal attention you need, and the clinic you're going to may be too large. I must say, however, that a number of large clinics provide services that many smaller organizations cannot: educational video-tapes, nurse practitioners to answer questions, on-site X-ray and testing laboratories, and counseling and support groups_all of which can be of great value.<P>
<I>Many communities are not large enough to support fertility specialists and in vitro clinics.</I> Traveling to distant medical facilities may add unnecessarily to your out-of-pocket expenses, absenteeism from work, and overall level of stress. If you have a good family practitioner and/or OB-GYN in your community who knows quite a bit about fertility treatment, I'd encourage you to begin there rather than travel hundreds of miles to a stranger. The "expert" isn't necessarily better just because he or she is located over one hundred mile s away. Often, you will find that your physician can work together with a fertility specialist to minimize your travel, expense and time.<P>
<B>A Final Note About Selecting a Doctor</b><BR>
<I>Fertility treatment isn't magic.</i> It is a structured, organized investigation. An obstetrician-gynecologist working together with a reproductive endocrinologist or urologist can diagnose and successfully treat the majority of people with fertility problems.<P>
Ultimately you should judge any doctor's ability based on the treatment plan he or she outlines especially for you and on the doctor's responsiveness to your problems and concerns.<P><hr>
<H2 align=center>Making a List and Checking It Twice</h2>

The first interview with your doctor provides an excellent opportunity for you to assess how well you will be able to work together.<P>
To prepare for your first visit, write down a list of questions you want to ask. To help formulate your questions, you may want to refer to the workup overview in <A href="ch4mb.html">chapter 4</a> as well as to the next section, which lists the questions people most frequently ask me. The reasons for asking some of these questions may not make complete sense until you've read the rest of this book. However, I feel I should put them here so you have them as background.<P>
<I>If you are already receiving fertility treatment, it is not too late to ask your doctor these questions.</I> If you spot any of the "Four Poor Treatment Danger Signs" discussed below, you may wish to reconsider your choice of doctors.<P><HR>
<h2 align=center>Questions to Ask Your Doctor</h2>
<b>About the Doctor's Practice</b><BR><ul>
<li>Do you have experience in fertility treatment?
<LI>When do you consult with a reproductive endocrinology specialist?

<h2 align=center>Four Poor treatment Danger Signs</h2>

Once you've selected your physician, you <I>are responsible for monitoring your doctor's performance.</i> That may sound strange to you, but if you hired a carpenter, auto mechanic, or roofer, you wouldn't think twice about making sure you were getting the work you contracted for. It's the same for a doctor. However, you must be an informed consumer in order to evaluate the doctor's performance.<P>
Below are four danger signs that will alert you that you may have chosen the wrong person:<OL>
<li><I>No clear cut fertility treatment plan.</I> If your physician does not formulate and discuss a treatment plan, you may be on the "hit-or-miss" regimen. After your first conference, your doctor should be able to outline the initial phases of your workup. After the basic workup, which may take four to six weeks, your doctor should be able to outline a treatment plan. you should be confident that your doctor, as would any good investigator, is using specific step-by-step procedures for getting answers about your fertility problem. If your doctor hasn't shared the plan with you, ask for a detailed explanation. (I'll describe the nature of these plans later.)</li><P>
Take notes and make sure that your doctor follows that course. If your doctor deviates from the plan, find out why. was it because of an unexpected test result? Our did the doctor forget certain details that were planned initially? Remember, <I>a ask questions when they arise.</i> Waiting for the straw that breaks the camel's black or assuming that the doctor is an infallible being who will take care of everything will get you into trouble. If your doctor's response to your request for a plan is not adequate, find a different doctor.</li><P>
<li><I>Poor communication.</I> If you can't talk to your doctor, at least one of you has a problem. Doctors are usually very busy, so as a rule they won't sit down and strike up a conversation hoping that eventually you will feel at ease enough to ask a question. If, after you leave the doctor's office, you always remember a question you meant to ask, I encourage you to write down your questions before your appointments. You should feel free to call back and talk to the nurse practitioner or to the doctor personally. If you feel that your doctor is not taking your questions seriously, is giving you superficial answers, seems impatient about explaining terms and treatment, persistently talks over your head, will not return your calls, or is too frequently not available when you need help, find another.</li><P>
<li><I>Unorthodox treatment or methods.</I> After reading this book, you will be well acquainted with the methods your doctor should be using. If your doctor deviates from these regimens_for example, by failing to perform a semen analysis, prescribing fertility drugs before doing a complete fertility evaluation, or administering Pergonal without using an ultrasound to monitor the number of eggs you're developing_you have reason to be concerned.<P>
Talk to your physician. Don't just assume he or she is incompetent. You may have misunderstood something you heard or read, or your condition might be out of the ordinary. If after getting the doctor's answers you are still troubled, however, you may wish to request a second opinion, especially when surgery is recommended. No good doctor should balk at this perfectly reasonable request. If you don't think your doctor is using the "best" fertility treatment procedures or if you lack faith in your doctor's decisions, then find another doctor.</li><P>
<LI><I>Your treatment is taking too long.</I> This is a tough one because the amount of time required to diagnose and treat each fertility problem is different for each patient. However, there are a few benchmarks you can watch for. Your initial workup should be complete within four to six weeks_ two months at the most. At that point your doctor should be able to give you the preliminary findings and should present your options for additional tests or treatment.</li></ul>
As your treatment progresses, you may tend to become impatient. You may forget, for example, that even after you are "cured," you are no more fertile than the average population at your age. At the most, you have a 20 percent chance of getting pregnant each month. So if your doctor feels that your fertility problem is resolved after six months of treatment, it may take another six to nine months for you to get pregnant. If you don't conceive in that time, your doctor may recommend conducting further tests.<P>
Doctors may often use a more aggressive treatment approach with an older couple like Richard and Margaret B., who were in their mid-thirties. A woman in that age group doesn't have that many fertile years left and her odds for "normal" pregnancy are getting slimmer each year. If you feel your fertile years are slipping away, discuss your concerns with your doctor. If your doctor isn't responsive, find another doctor.<P>
I tailor the rate of treatment to each couple. Some people want to know all of the answers right now. Others want to proceed more slowly_they need time for things to sink in. For example, Shelley T. had a limited budget, so the pacing of her treatment plan was slower than for Margaret, who wanted to get pregnant as soon as possible. Each of these women required a custom-designed treatment plan that would accommodate her life-style.<P>
Is your treatment taking too long? That's very hard to judge. But if you're really worried about it, talk with your doctor and your RESOLVE support group counselors. <I>If you don't feel that you're making progress, get a second opinion or find a new doctor.</i><P>
I encourage you to learn as much as you can about fertility treatment and, above all, never to accept your doctor's recommendations complacently. Ultimately, you are responsible for the quality of care you receive. You are responsible for selecting the doctor who is best qualified to help you get your miracle baby.<P><HR>
