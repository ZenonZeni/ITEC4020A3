<h1>Abraham Bill Passes Friday Night As Senate Rejects Sentencing
Commission's Lighter Sentences </h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p>WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 /PRNewswire/ -- U.S. Senator Spencer
Abraham (R-Michigan) won a big victory over the drug pushers as
the Senate passed his bill which blocks new sentencing guidelines
lowering crack cocaine offenses. The Abraham Amendment passed by
unanimous consent late Friday evening. </p>

<p>&quot;Drug pushers all across America were cheering at the
Sentencing Commission's proposal to lower prison sentences for
crack offenses,&quot; Abraham said. &quot;As hard as it is to
believe, there are some policy makers in Washington who actually
want to lower prison sentences for drug pushers who target our
children. But tonight the Senate put an end to the drug dealers'
celebration, and our children and neighborhoods are a little
safer.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;This is no way to be waging the war on drugs, and the
Senate did the right thing by rejecting the proposal to lower
these drug sentences,&quot; Abraham said. &quot;The purpose of
the bill is simple: to block implementation of proposals by the
Sentencing Commission that would lower sentences for crack
dealers.&quot; </p>

<p>On May 1, the Sentencing Commission, an independent agency
appointed by the President, proposed changes to the Sentencing
Guidelines that would lower crack distribution sentences to
between 1/2 and 1/6 of their present length. This would mean that
some crack dealers who under current law would get substantial
sentences could end up serving no jail time at all. </p>

<p>&quot;I think this sends entirely the wrong message: that in
the war against crack, society blinked,&quot; Abraham said.
&quot;That is not what we should be telling the crack dealers.
And that is not what we should be telling the brave law abiding
members of communities under attack by the crack dealers who are
fighting back.&quot; </p>

<p>Abraham's bill will stop those Sentencing Commission proposals
which automatically go into effect on November 1 -- and make sure
that any other guidelines which lower drug sentences don't get
implemented. The House must now take up similar action to defeat
the guidelines. </p>

<p>The Sentencing Commission cited the reason for their proposal
was out of concern that because a majority of crack distributors
sentenced are African-Americans, the higher crack sentences
creates a perception of unfairness. The Commission based their
concern on the fact that sentences for powder cocaine sentences
are lower than crack sentences. </p>

<p>&quot;I agree with part of the Commission's concern, but the
answer is not to lower the crack sentences, but to toughen the
powder sentences,&quot; Abraham said. &quot;That is why I hope
Congress will act soon on the bill I've introduced to raise the
sentences for powder distribution by making the triggers for
mandatory minimums 100 grams for 5 years and 1000 grams for ten
years, rather than 500 and 5000 as they are now.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;The Sentencing Commission's solution -- to address this
'unfairness' by lowering the crack sentences -- is a truly
terrible idea. It is not fair to the vast majority of people
living in communities, like Detroit, under attack by the crack
dealers and trying to defend them -- many of whom are
African-Americans. And I am sure it is the last thing in the
world that many of them would want,&quot; Abraham said. </p>
