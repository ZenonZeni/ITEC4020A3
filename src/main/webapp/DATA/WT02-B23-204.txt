<H3>Management of Stimulant Medication: <BR>
Do Medication Holidays and Skipped Doses Disable? </H3>

<P><B>Thomas A. Blondis</B>, M.D., University of Chicago School of Medicine,
Chicago, IL </P>

<P>The point-counterpoint of whether or not physicians should give children
taking stimulant medication two or three doses per day and whether children
should be given holidays off of medication continues. Pediatricians have
stressed the effects that too much stimulant medication might have on growth,
while child psychiatrists have been less concerned with such side effects.
A history of investigations has demonstrated that side-effects are related
to how much medication is given each dose. </P>

<P>Despite considerable speculation about the negative effects on development
of prenatal exposure to drugs and alcohol, scientific data regarding specific
information is limited. This presentation reviews studies on learning deficits
in childhood and adolescence and summarizes the impact of alcohol exposure
on visual-spatial and math skills as well as the effect of cocaine on development.

children learning disorders. Various aspects pertaining to pharmacotherapy
of learning disorders will be reviewed including the effects of medication
on learning, cognition, and behavior. Finally, various emanative effects
of medication will be reviewed as they impact teachers, children, and parents.
Other aspects pertaining to children receiving medication will be reviewed

<B>Michael McCanna, Ph.D</B>., Evanston Hospital Evaluation Center for
Learning, Glenview, IL <B>Liz Andrews Smith, M.A.</B>, Northwestern University,
Evanston, IL </P>

<P>Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and non-compliant behaviors
(e.g., oppositional defiant disorder) are each prevalent in school-age
children and frequently co-occur. The differential diagnosis of these disorders,
their impact in school and home settings, and appropriate intervention
strategies, will be discussed. </P>

<P>An understanding of and strategies for remediating the impact of Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Tourette
Syndrome and Executive Dysfunction on the seven areas of learning disabilities
will be discussed. This will include definitions and cognitive modification
strategies that can be easily utilized in the regular classroom, the resource

<H3>Neuroanatomical Changes in Developmental Dyslexia </H3>

<P><B>Gordon Sherman, Ph.D.</B>, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA </P>

<P>Developmental dyslexia affects up to 10-15% of the school-age population.
Recent research has shown that the brains of dyslexics are organized differently
than normal readers. These changes probably result from a developmental
alteration during the prenatal period that results in a change in neuronal
connections. The ramifications of these connectivity differences for learning,
teaching and remediation will be discussed in this presentation. </P>

<H3>Learning Disabilities: Comorbidity with Other Emotional and Neurological
Disorders </H3>

<P>Larry B. Silver, M.D., Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington,
DC </P>

<P>It is not uncommon for individuals with Learning Disabilities to develop
secondary emotional problems, including depression disorders, anxiety disorders,
oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder. In addition to discussing
each disorder, the current research data thinking on why there is such
a high comorbidity with these disorders will be presented. There are certain
neurological disorders with a high comorbidity with Learning Disabilities:
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Sensory Integrative Disorder,
Tic Disorders (including Tourette's Disorder), and Obsessive-Compulsive
Disorder. Each will be discussed. </P>

GA</P>

<P>A more collaborative relationship between educators and health care
providers optimizes the academic experiences for the 12 million students
nationwide with specialized medical and educational needs. This seminar
will address how chronic illness may impact a child or adolescent's school
attendance and/or behavioral and academic performance. Specific effects
on academic and social functioning of selected illnesses (asthma, diabetes,
leukemia, etc.), medications and other treatments (radiation, sedation,
agitation), and psychosocial adjustment to the illness will be addressed.
Time will be allowed for audience participation in a question/answer period.

Neurophysiologic and Behavioral Evidence </H3>

<P><B>Steven G. Zecker, Ph.D.</B>, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL
<BR>
<B>Nina Kraus, Ph.D.</B>, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL</P>

<P>Many children with learning disabilities and intact peripheral hearing
nonetheless experience difficulties in processing auditory information.
An overview of existing research, along with data from an ongoing project
that indicate that deficits in discriminating speech sounds originate in
the auditory pathway and are pre-attentive in nature will be presented.
