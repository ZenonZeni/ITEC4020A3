<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Executive Summary</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">There are many power producing products available on the market  today. Batteries and internal combustion engines are foremost among  these products. Both batteries and internal combustion engines have an established infra-structure, are priced to fit diverse applications, and are readily available. The disadvantages  of these traditional products revolve around  practical limitations and environmental issues. Fuel cell technology has the ability to magnify  the positive aspects of these existing products while overcoming the practical and environmental challenges.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Historically, fuel cell development has been directed toward high  reliability/high cost systems, such as the NASA  space missions of the 1960s. Maximized performance is paramount for such uses.  Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. There is an urgent need in the public sector for economic fuel cells to serve as alternatives to internal combustion engines or to provide sources  of longer portable power. By necessity, the design objectives  of fuel cell development have  changed from high performance/high cost to a more down-to-earth focus on high reliability/low cost in order to become cost competitive for specific applications.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Beginning with the principle  of ‘cost by application,' the DAIS Corporation has developed a series of new proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell materials. These materials include (1) a new membrane, (2) a cost effective electrode structure engineered for use with the membrane, (3) an interface polymer to mate the membrane and electrode, and (4) two novel "stack" or housing designs that make best use of the novel materials.</FONT> <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The primary target market for these  PEM fuel cell innovations is in the portable power source arena. Applications abound, including outdoor recreational products, domestic emergency power devices, portable power supplies for military personnel, trades-person tool and site power, and portable equipment power supplies.  A  second market for the PEM fuel cell technology is manufacturers of products that use small engines (i.e. all sorts of outdoor power equipment, portable generators, small transportation uses, marine applications, and solar hydrogen hybrids).</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">DAIS’s fuel cell technology possesses several advantages over existing battery technologies in terms of weight, energy density, unit lifetime, and cost.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Given this unique forum’s mission statement of "The Dawn of Commercialization," it is DAIS’s intention to present a brief summary  of these technical advances,  and indicate how these novel materials assembled in a fuel cell will impact the marketplace acceptance of fuel cell technology.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">I. Forms of Power</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">There are many power producing products available on the market  today. Batteries and internal combustion engines comprise the majority  of these products.</FONT><P></P> 

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Many products that use batteries are standardized  to accept the traditional AA, AAA, C, D, or automobile sized batteries. In 1995 there were over 5.3 billion dry cell batteries (of all types) alone sold worldwide<SUP>2</SUP>.  There are over 62,000 gasoline retailers in the US<SUP>3</SUP>. This is a large established infrastructure for obtaining the required fuel for internal combustion engine applications.</FONT><P></P>  

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">A grocery store in Minot, North Dakota can sell "AA" sized batteries for approximately the same cost as a similar store in Florence, Italy. This speaks to the accepted form factor of "AA" batteries, and of the relative price acceptance of the battery’s functionality. An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) in Troy, NY uses a 5hp, 4 cycle engine that costs approximately $155 per unit to power its line of outdoor power equipment. This is the same unit that a firm in Moline, Illinois would use to power its line of outdoor equipment. People have accepted the design, the availability, the costs , the upkeep, the risks, and the compromises and undesirable aspects of the two primary forms of power.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The point is that  major forms of power in the world today are an outgrowth of over 100 years of product and technology evolution. This evolution has accepted the compromises of the given technology.</FONT> <P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">And certainly these  products are not without deficiency and compromise. The very definition of compromise is the lack of features or functionality that the entire marketplace has had to accept.</FONT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">In today’s battery powered technology these compromises are:</FONT>
   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">weight</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">environmental disposal</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">lifetime</FONT>
</UL>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">A minimal set of compromises for the internal combustion engine include:</FONT>
   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">noise</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">weight</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">environmental damage</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">efficiency of operation</FONT>
</UL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Any new power generation approach  has to address not only the perceived negatives but include the strengths of the existing technology. Given the 100 plus year infrastructure build up for battery and internal combustion technology,  the first issue a new technology would need to address is cost competitiveness.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Consumer studies have repeatedly shown that new technology generally can charge an incremental premium given an easily perceived increase in value or functionality <SUP>4</SUP>.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">With this in mind,  and recognizing the compromise issues outlined above,  the conclusion can be drawn that a new form of power producing technology needs to include the following attributes:</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Fuel cell technology has the ability to meet  these  ‘new technology’ attributes. Fuel cells possess the necessary characteristics to excel as power source in the next wave of technology.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">II. History that leads to the Future</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Fuel cell development, since the NASA missions of the 1960s, has focused on high reliability, high cost systems. Consequently, the materials, control systems, and designs have reflected this bias and are in many cases over-designed for cost-sensitive commercial applications. DAIS has adopted the strategy  that in order to compete against traditional forms of power generation fuel cell technology must have high reliability and be priced to address the application.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Historically fuel cell technology has been priced at approximately $8 per Watt. What is behind this sky-high expense?  Quite simply, the  cost of the materials forced a need to obtain the highest power output possible. Engineers and scientists added gas hydration, compression, and heat. These ancillary devices, coupled with the basic cost of the materials have produced a situation that violates Required Attribute #1 stated above: staying within 7% of existing power production methods.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">In 1993, the DAIS Corporation formed to address the materials aspect of this technology. The emphasis was placed on developing a set of materials that could eliminate  the compromises of the existing forms of power generation while tailoring the materials to commercial application(s). As an example:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a lawnmower powered by a 5hp internal combustion engine in the US is 455 hours.<SUP>6</SUP></FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a 125cc Scooter in Europe is 1890 hours.<SUP>7</SUP></FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">the average lifetime of a 6v lantern battery running a Coleman 7300 series camping lantern is 8.5 hours.<SUP>8</SUP></FONT> 
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">By comparison the DAIS materials all have a rated life that exceeds each application lifetime stated above. Traditional fuel cells have longer lifetimes, and (using the ancillary equipment) higher power densities per cell. This existing technology again violates the first principle of marketplace acceptance - the costs are too high to create an upsurge  of support.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>


<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">III. The DAIS Materials</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS materials have been engineered  to run in the following operational environment:</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

   <UL>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Ambient pressure on the Cathode </FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Operating temperatures of 35 to 50<SUP>0</SUP> C</FONT>
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">No additional hydration of the reactant gases</FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Active controlled air flow over the Cathode</FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Consistent power level of no less than 200 mW/cm<SUP>2</SUP></FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Power density of .17 to .23 kW/liter and .45 to .61 kW/kg</FONT> 
   <LI><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Lifetime minimum of 2,500 hours per cell</FONT>
</UL>

<H4><FONT FACE="ARIAL">A. The DAIS 585 Membrane:</FONT></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS membrane material (known as <EM>DAIS 585</EM>) is a sulfonated styrene/ethylene-butylene/styrene triblock copolymer. The material is an elastic, hydrocarbon-based hydrogel with cation exchange ability, and good optical transparency. The block copolymer contains approximately 29% wt styrene units. Sulfonation levels (based on styrene units) range from ca.15-60%. Water uptake and extent of swelling depend on the sulfonation level.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">Cast films in the acid (H+) forms have ionic conductivity's (when fully hydrated) of greater than 9 x 10-2 S/cm, which are comparable to those of the fluoropolymer Nafion®. Numerous derivatives with different cations, including many that are redox-active, are readily prepared from the parent polymer</FONT>.<P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The material is available at sulfonation levels of 55%-60% as a pre-cast reinforced film (approximate thicknesses of 50 - 200 micron) or as a solution in alcohol (either 5% or 10% solids).</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><FONT FACE="ARIAL">B. The DAIS electrode and Membrane/Electrode Assembly:</FONT></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS electrode is a porous gas diffusion electrode comprised  of (a) an electronically conductive porous body in electrical contact with (b) a catalyst layer that in turn consists of  (i) a catalyst dispersed on the surface of a carbon support; (ii) a water-insoluble sulfonated polystyrene, sulfonated poly(a-methylstyrene) or sulfonated styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene (SEBS) block copolymer; and (iii) a nonionic fluorocarbon polymer.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The preferred sulfonated polystyrenes, poly(a-methylstyrene)s and SEBS's have a conductivity of 0.04 S/cm or greater, a molecular weight from 30,000 to 1,000,000, and are 10 to 60 mole percent sulfonated. The sulfonated polystyrene is percentage of the molecular weight (200,000 to 400,000). The catalyst material is platinum.</FONT><P></P> 

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS electrodes (and interface polymer), when mated with the DAIS 585 membrane, form a Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA).</FONT> <P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">DAIS MEAs come in a variety of shapes with a 6" square presently being the largest. Power densities of the all-DAIS membrane electrode assembly have yielded 165mW/cm2 at 5/10 of a volt. <A HREF="http://dais.net/images/curve.jpg" TITLE="Please click">Please click</A> here to view a recent power curve using passive and active air forced over the cathode.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><FONT FACE="ARIAL">C.  The DAIS "PowerCell" Stack Designs <SUP>9</SUP>:</FONT></H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Traditional stack housing designs require peripheral support devices (compressors, heaters, water inlet/outlet, etc.) to yield high electrical current. The housings tended to be constructed of a block- style heavy gauge stainless steel metal with individual cell components made of a graphite-like (or filled) composite material. </FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">By way of contrast -- the DAIS  fuel cell housing designs (Radial Air Stack – RAS, and Single In Line Module – SIM) provide special  air and hydrogen flows, and successfully manage the water produced by the fuel cell’s electrochemical reaction.  The base materials are made of engineering grade plastics. The Radial Air design is unique  due to its air flow pattern and use of a single compression bolt along with external hydrogen fuel distribution manifolds. The SIM design is progressive in regards  to the ease of parts  fabrication, low cost, and active material protection. Each design is lightweight, and is specifically targeted to be used in portable or semi-portable consumer, commercial, or military applications.</FONT><P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

 
<B><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Figure 1: <I>RAS Stack Design</FONT></I></B><BR><P></P>
<IMG SRC="http://dais.net/images/fc2000f2.gif" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=800 HSPACE=25>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Both novel housing designs (RAS and SIM) are engineered for use with the DAIS Corporation’s patented (or patent pending) Proton Exchange Membrane based fuel cell materials (membrane electrolyte, anode cathode, backing material, and interface polymer). Furthermore , it is possible to combine the best aspects of each design into a single design that is far superior to either design alone.</FONT> <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

 
<B><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Figure 2: <I>Single In Line Module Design - Passive</FONT></I></B><BR><P></P>
<IMG SRC="http://dais.net/images/fc2000f1.gif" WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=400>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">Both designs can be either passive or active air flow managed. The use of the passive mode makes a less expensive PowerCell device. Adding the active air flow over the cathode generally produces a 3x improvement in the overall power density. Each air management scheme can be adapted  to a specific  application or price point.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">DAIS requires  its materials and designs to not only function and provide stable power but to be financially attractive to end users. This is a fundamental axiom with DAIS, whether the end user is an electrician working with portable power tools on a remote job site or a large multi-national firm that produces outdoor power equipment. The cost and functionality must meet Attribute #1 of cost competitiveness as stated before.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The above chart is an estimate of how the DAIS technologies will price at a retail level given a modest level of production volume.</FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><FONT FACE="ARIAL">V. Conclusions and Summary</FONT></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="ARIAL">The benefits of fuel cell technology have long been out of reach for commercial, military, or consumer use. The primary reasons have been the  cost of the materials, and the resulting physical designs required to make the technology work have proved unable to make the grade for popular marketplace acceptance.</FONT><P></P><BR>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">The DAIS Corporation has examined the cost-to-application needs of this exciting technology of Proton Exchange Membrane fuel cells. Each element of this technology has been analyzed from the perspective of cost, manufacturing, and application. DAIS has invented new, lower cost, functional materials including a new hydrocarbon based membrane, a stable electrode assembly, a novel interface polymer, and two advanced  stack designs.</FONT><P></P>

<FONT FACE="ARIAL">These new materials and stack/housing designs form the basis for an applications priced method of electrical power generation. This technology will initially be aimed at the appliance marketplace of 1kW and under.<P></P></FONT>
