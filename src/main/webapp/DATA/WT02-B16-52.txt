<b>Federal Energy Management Program</b>


<P


<I>A private-public partnership brought about by the Department of Energy's 


Federal Energy Management Program will reduce the Federal budget deficit by 


millions of dollars while creating jobs in the State of New Mexico.    At Kirtland Air 


Force Base, the Defense Department expects to save more than $500,000 


annually with new  procedures to reduce water and sewage use, plus more than 


$7 million annually through energy efficiency improvements.   Kirtland is the first 


project in the "New Mexico Initiative", a comprehensive energy and water savings 


program at Federal facilities throughout the state.   The Kirtland agreement -- 


signed by the City of Albuquerque, Kirtland Air Force Base, Sandia National 


Laboratories, the State Engineers Office, and Public Service Company of New 


Mexico--is making the base a model of resource efficiency for other Federal 


installations.   Energy efficiency projects like this expanded to all Defense 


Department installations will save more money than the scheduled base 


closures.    Translated throughout the Federal government, efficiency projects can 


save $15 billion by 2015.   </I>


<P>


As the world's largest consumer of goods and services, the Federal government 


has a major impact on the marketplace.    When the government buys energy 


efficient and environmentally-sound products, it saves money for taxpayers, 


helps good products obtain a foothold in the economy and reduces waste and 


environmental damages. 


<P>


Today the Federal government spends about $8 billion yearly on energy for its 


fleets, buildings and operations.    The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and Executive 


Order 12902 direct agencies to reduce consumption 30% by the year 2005, 


compared to 1985 levels.    Cumulative net savings will total more than $15 billion 


by 2015.    At the same time, we get free pollution prevention.


<P>


DOE's<B> Federal Energy Management Program</B> (FEMP) is charged with 


leading this effort and is establishing public-private partnerships to achieve 


deficit reduction. 


<P>


<B>Fiscal Year 1997 Highlight</B>


<P>


<I>Energy for Today</I>


<P>


In Fiscal Year 1997, FEMP will attract at least $40 million in new private 


investments for Federal energy efficiency projects.   A new Energy Saver 


Performance Contract will be issued to simplify and accelerate private sector 


investment.    FEMP will expand its efforts to utilize incentives offered by utilities.    


In addition, FEMP provides technical assistance and is establishing Partner 


Resource Centers with utilities, energy service companies, industry and states to 


make FEMP publications, training, audits and software widely available.


<P>


FEMP also leads energy efficiency efforts within the Department of Energy.   The 


In-House Energy Management  program saves DOE more than $100 million in 


utility expenses annually.    Each $1 invested in energy efficiency at DOE facilities 


yields approximately $5 in net return.  


<P>


<I>Energy for Tomorrow</I>


<P>


During Fiscal Year 1997, FEMP will develop and implement <B>a Federal 


Renewable Initiative</B>, providing technical training, project financing 


negotiations and renewable energy showcase projects in Federal facilities.


<P>


Through the<B> FEMP-State Initiative</B>, FEMP is working closely with State 


Energy Offices, some of whom have considerable experience with their own 


facilities, to strengthen the local infrastructure and investment pool so more 


Federal and state projects can be implemented.   


<P>


FEMP has worked with the Office of Management and Budget to issue a<B> 


Federal Procurement Challenge</B>--a voluntary, government-wide 


commitment to use Federal buying power to reduce energy costs and expand 


markets for energy efficient and water-conserving technologies.    Twenty-two 


agencies, representing more than 95% of Federal buying power, pledged to take 


the Challenge. 


<P>


FEMP is providing its customers direct technical help through<B> Regional 


Energy Action Project Teams</B> at DOE's six Regional Support Offices: 


Boston, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Denver and Seattle.    In Fiscal Year 


1997, the teams will continue to support FEMP and its customers through direct 


technical help.


<P>


<B>Benefits</B>


<P>


<B>Energy Savings: </B> A 20% reduction in energy use by all agencies 


by 2000, and a 30% reduction by 2005.


<P>


<B>Taxpayer Savings:</B>  $380 million annually by 2000 for a 


cumulative net total of $20 billion by 2015.


<P>


<B>Leveraging:</B>  More than $1 billion in private investments from 


utilities and other organizations by the year 2000.


<P>


<B>Pollution Prevention:</B>  Over 2 million metric tons of carbon 


equivalent in 2005.
