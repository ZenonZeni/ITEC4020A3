Re:&nbsp; State of Iowa v. Helmers, Allen Douglass PIN #483567994
Case No. FECR047575 <br>
<br>
To Whom It May Concern <br>
<br>
I am writing to plead for mercy in the case of <a
href="helmers1.html">Allen Helmers</a> listed above. <br>
<br>
How can any of you morally justify your actions when considering
the facts in this case?&nbsp; To send a disabled man to prison
for smoking marijuana for pain (his <a href="verduyn.html">doctor</a>
advises him that it is the best and safest way for him to manage
his pain), and at the same time allowing an uninsured drunk
motorist to go free (7 days in jail and 18 months probation)! <br>
<br>
Seriously ill people who use marijuana as medicine should not be
arrested and required to prove their medical necessity in a
criminal trial. Seriously ill patients should have their claims
heard by the Iowa Board of Pharmacy Examiners or some other
qualified board.&nbsp; If a seriously ill patient has a legitimate
medical necessity, that patient should be certified and be
exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa. <br>
<br>
Iowa recognizes the defense of &quot;medical necessity&quot; to
prosecution for the possession of marijuana in the state of
Iowa.&nbsp; <a href="../iowa/pleas.html">State of Iowa v. Jan
Pleas</a>, No. 22690, Pottawattamie District Court (June 16,
1994).&nbsp; Iowa law recognizes the therapeutic value of
marijuana.&nbsp; Iowa Code 124.206(7)(a). <br>
<br>
Please refer to the enclosed documents. <br>
<br>
Thank you. <br>
