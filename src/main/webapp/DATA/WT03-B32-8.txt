ORACLE TO SHOW OFF ITS NETWORK COMPUTER

The center piece in Oracle's plans to put an affordable
networking computer in every household will make its first
appearance amidst both hype and controversy.
     A prototype of the Newton-based network computer (NC) -
also dubbed the US$500 'communications box' -- will be
demonstrated this February in San Francisco, California.
     NC will feature word processing, Internet access and
possibly videoconferencing.  And for about US$30 a month,
customers would subscribe to 'Web TV,' a simplified and
streamlined network that provides quick access to news
bites, the ability to download video on high quality lines,
surf the Net or send e-Mail.
     "Web TV will be available by the end of the first
quarter, or in the second quarter," said Oracle CEO Larry
Ellison.  "It [Oracle's network computer] will video-enable
the Internet."
     The kind of information that would be on Web TV would
be informative, fast-changing news such as the stock market.
Also the entertainment industry could utilize Web TV as an
advertising tool.
     "Companies like Time Warner would make great suppliers
of content, (News Corp's) Rupert Murdoch's stuff would be
good, Disney, and news organizations. There'd be no risk;
they would control their own servers," said Ellison, a
staunch believer that education and electronic commerce
would be the most successful interactive TV ventures.
     NC would also get its 'brains' from the servers. The
communications box will have no hard disc, software or
floppy disc.  Each time users turned on their NC, it
would download the latest network upgrades.
     Recently LSI Logic Corporation recently unveiled a
microchip technology intended to support a US$500
Internet device.  The company already specializes in
integrating functions on a single affordable chip,
prompting such popular low-cost products as Sony's
PlayStation.
According to LSI, it will be able to design a chip for
as little as US$50 that, when combined with a US$100
memory chip, will provide the core of an Internet device.
  PC's have long been a relatively expensive commodity
whose cheapest price for a new stripped down machine is
still around US$2,000.  And many industry analysts agreed
that the price of the machines would not drop below the
US$1,000 floor because of the ripple effect it would have
on the rest of the computer industry.
     "To get to a US$500 point would probably mean
inventing a new business model, new OS, new
microprocessor, new group of competitors and new ballgame
with entirely new rules," said Mark Stahlman, president
of market research firm New Media Associates based in New
York.
     The cheap PC is also nothing new to the computer
industry.  The most successful machine via the now
defunct Commodore Amiga had the fastest sales ramp-up in
PC history. Although Commodore failed, the computer
industry today is spurred by the need to bring multimedia
telecommunications en masse.
     Frontiers such as video-conferencing, educational
interactive TV and electronic commerce make it ripe for
brave new worlds.
  "Can the industry withstand a new set of rules?" said
Stahlman.  "It might be here sooner than you think."
     Maybe in February.

THE RACE FOR 'DATABASE ON THE NET' HEATS UP

  The race to become the leader in managing data on the
Web heated up when two prominent Silicon Valley database
management companies agreed to a merger.
     Database software leader Informix Corp. will
purchase for about US$332 million Illustra Information
Technologies, a California-based information management
tool vendor.  The merger was spurred by the World Wide
Web's need for sophisticated software to manage complex
types of data such as audio, video, 3-D graphics and time-
series 'stock markettype' information.
     Roughly 12.9 million shares of Informix stock will
be issued to acquire all outstanding shares of Illustra.
And an additional 2.1 million will be reserved for
Illustra's stock options.  The value of the deal was in
the neighborhood of US$332 million when plans for the
merger were announced.  The actual price tag will be
determined by Informix stock price when the deal finally
is signed.
   "In addition to our shared visions and markets, the
synergy with Illustra's technology gives us a significant
time-to-market advantage," said Phil White, Informix CEO
and chairman.
     Although Informix had been developing its own tools
to handle complex data types, Illustra has slightly more
comprehensive technology and should help Informix' speed
to market by as much as a half-a-year.
     The challenge now facing the two companies is to
integrate their different database products into one line
-in this case, Illustra's management system and Informix'
core parallel database technology known as the Dynamic
Scaleable Architecture (DSA).
     Currently the Illustra tools are compatible with DSA
as a layered environment, requiring developers to
recognize they are dealing with two different products.
A complete integration of the two is expected later this
year and should be a more intelligent repository,
according to Dan Kusnetzky, industry analyst at market
research firm International Data Corporation.
     The companies plan to hire 1,500 to 2,000 new
employees, and have the new integrated product on the
market by October 1996.
     "On one hand I see it as advanced technology and put
them in position of having a very modular environment,"
said Kusnetzky. "But I also feel that maybe Informix may
have paid too much."
     The market for relational database software is
currently anywhere from US$6 billion to US$8 billion,
according to Informix.  That figure is expected to
increase ten-fold within five years due largely in part
to the advent of the World Wide Web.
     The big three database vendors -- Sybase, Oracle and
Informix -- have been jockeying of late for position in
the
fast-growing Internet market.
     Informix also recently announced a linking of its
database offering with Netscape's browser and teamed with
Internet software provider net.Genesis Corp. in a multi-
year bundling agreement.
     The bundled package will include Informix-SE, a
'loadand-go database server; net.Genesis' net.Form, an
automated forms processing engine for the Web; and
net.Genesis' net.Thread, a software product that creates
and manages interactive discussion forums on Web sites.
   The package, carrying the promise to make Web sites
more functional for both consumers and suppliers, will be
introduced sometime in the first quarter 1996.

FIBRE CHANNEL PRODUCTS STARTING TO SHIP

     Users can expect to see much more of Fibre Channel
technology over the next few months as products are
finally starting to ship and industry confidence has been
raised a notch.
     Fibre Channel -an American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) developed standard- was designed as a
single high performance interconnect for use in
enterprise network settings. Fibre Channel is essentially
touted as a highspeed interface for linking mainframes
and peripherals.
     The almost year-and-a-half old standard vendors say
provides for scalability, high performance as well as
interoperability with existing network technologies like
SCSI and TCP/IP. At the most basic level, Fibre Channel
transports data between one buffer at the source device
and another buffer at the end, or destination device.
  The speed and scalability of Fibre Channel, said Doug
Anderson, product manager for Fibre Channel switch
supplier Ancor Communications, are two of the
technology's big perks. Fibre Channel switches, as well
as adapters provide 266Mbps to 1 Gbps per port. Customers
are able to scale of to tens of thousands of ports with
relatively little hassle.
     More so, Fibre Channel offers a high level of
reliability through a credit-based flow control feature.
     "Fibre Channel combines all of the positive
     properties
of both channels and LANs into a single fabric that does
not have any of the disadvantages associated with
either," Anderson said. You are guaranteeing that all
data that is sent is always received...channels offer
very high reliability so you don't end up with dropped
data."
     Proponents of Fibre Channel say that the technology
can practically be used in a LAN as a way of moving
missioncritical traffic over a network, and to storage
and cluster environments.
     But Michael Howard, president of consultancy
Infonetics Research, said that Fibre Channel looks
somewhat limited in its use, and has a long way to go as
far as gaining widespread acceptance within the industry.
At this point there is "a lot more awareness" of
asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)  technology than there
is of Fibre Channel.
     "The real use for Fibre Channel is really in a data
center, not as a hub to hub connector or backbone for
your LAN," Howard said. "Other than H-P, there are no
router or hub companies that are [incorporating] Fibre
Channel. That would say to me that the applications are
in the data center."
     On the product front, two major disk drive
manufacturers have begun jumping on the Fibre Channel
bandwagon. Seagate Technology and Western Digital are now
shipping product based on a jointly developed Fibre
Channel interconnect specification that enables high
speed data
transfer between CPUs and their drives.
     One of the main advantages to the Fibre Channel
connectors will be that network managers can add storage to
their systems without actually having to take the server
offline. The interconnect specification has been a joint
effort of Western Digital, AMP Inc., Compaq Computer Corp.
and Sun Microsystems.
     From the systems builders, Compaq said it will use the
technology for storage applications which require large
application systems. The company will include a Fibre
Channel connector on each of its four server clusters that
are due out sometime next year. The servers, analysts say,
are likely to include support for Unix as well as Windows
NT operating systems.
   The companies are touting the connector specification
as key to enterprise computing environments where making
changes to mission-critical systems are made on a regular
basis. By being "hot pluggable" the Fibre Channel
technology assures companies of fault-tolerance in their
systems.
    By having a Fibre Channel connector specification,
users can now count on lower cost systems. Before, users
were required to purchase systems which had proprietary
connectors, which hiked up costs. According to Bryan
Yunker, engineering manager at Western Digital, the Fibre
Channel spec will ultimately give users more storage for
less cost.
     "[With Fibre Channel] you can have a lot of storage
attached, very simply," Yunker said. "You can attach large
quantities of disk drive capacity to a very simple daisy
chain BUS...you can create very cost-effective clusters."
     Jeff Vogel, director of marketing at Western, the
specification "removes what we believe to be the last
bandwidth barrier" for users. "Users will feel more
comfortable now knowing there is a significant
infrastructure in place for their high-speed interconnect
needs," he said.

IBM TO PUMP-UP WAR CHEST, HAS ANALYSTS GUESSING

     Still digesting its new Lotus subsidiary, IBM could
be moving towards yet another - and possibly even bigger
acquisition.
   IBM recently filed papers with the the US regulatory
body, the Securities and Exchange Commission, that say it
wants to add US$1.7 billion to its already massive US$7
billion war chest.
     The filing ignited speculation amongst industry
analysts that plans for Big Blue's often referred to 'King
Kong' acquisition may be in the works.
     IBM quietly registered to issue up the added amount
of stock, debt or warrent just before Christmas.  As word
of the filing spread, analysts quickly became divided on
the motivations behind the company.
   "It doesn't surprise me because IBM will need to make
another acquisition," said Mark Magillivray, president of
H&M Consulting.  "It's no secret IBM is trying to buy its
way into the markets, it constantly talks to companies
behind the scenes."
     Last year, US sources say IBM's offer of US$4.5
billion for Apple was rebuked.  IBM was also believed to
have looked at Novell with or without its WordPerfect
subsidiary.
    Any plans it had of taking on the WordPerfect line
appeared to be failing as a management group backed by
venture capital money is reported to be the front-runner.
     According to Magillivray, the stockpile of cash also
offers important acquisition advantages over borrowed
money. The former gives IBM the option to pursue hostile
power
plays similar to the one in the Lotus deal.
     "Whatever they decide to buy, they will pretty much
get it," said Magillivray.  "And although it may not be
tomorrow, IBM is still interested in Apple... and IBM is
wise to be getting cash together to buy Apple if and when
they get in trouble."
     But not all analysts agreed the 'King Kong'
acquisition -- a term used by IBM's then-Chief Financial
Officer Jerome York after the Lotus buyout who maintained
that this was not the 'King Kong' acquisition IBM hinted
at earlier -- is Apple or any other company.
     One insider, who wished to remain anonymous, believes
IBM may be saving up for a telecommunications company,
while others speculate the company is simply trying to
initiate a stock buyback or firm up its bottom line.
     Another analyst is skeptical of the filing believing
it to be an empty shell.
   "I don't think IBM would have an interest in any mega
deals," said Bob Djurdjevic, lon-time IBM watcher and head
of research firm Annex Research.  "I don't see a reason to
bother with Novell, and although I see an opportunity for
them to get together with Apple, why take on all those
manufacturing problems?"
     Despite the $US3.0 billion acquisition of Lotus and
the over $US4.0 billion of common stock repurchases
completed during 1995, IBM has maintained excellent
liquidity.  And, as IBM continues to improve, the company
will have the increased ability to dedicate a portion of
its internally generated cash flow toward other
discretionary uses.

HIGH-TECH COMPANIES DELIGHTED AFTER CLINTON VETO OVERRIDE

     The U.S. Congress overturned a veto by President
Clinton for the first time... and Silicon Valley's high-
tech companies are celebrating.
     The reason is that the new law Congress passed is
intended to protect companies from frivolous lawsuits.
     High-tech companies are frequent targets of
     securities
fraud lawsuits as a direct result of volatile stock prices
and disgruntled investors.
     A letter from the industry lobby group American
Electronics Association directed to the president and
signed by over 200 companies including 3Com, Hewlett-
Packard and Apple, included a statement from an
unidentified Silicon Valley CEO.
     "There are only two kinds of California technology
companies - those that have been sued, and those about to
be sued," he wrote.
     President Clinton's veto took the AEA by surprise.
In his veto message, Clinton voiced concerns regarding
the difficulty for shareholders to file lawsuits and the
avoidance of liability by high-tech companies for faulty
financial projections.
     Nearly 53 percent of technology companies located
in the Silicon Valley have been sued under current
securities law, including each of the top ten
corporations.
     Estimates total over $600 million in settlements,
     one
third of which was spent on legal fees.
     The Securities Litigation Reform Act will
accomplish increases in corporate disclosure
requirements, including information concerning economic
downturns.
     The bill also provides judges with the mechanism to
force plaintiffs to post bond to cover expenses in
advance of trial.
     In addition the plaintiffs will be required to
submit documentation that a company's conduct was
intentional or
reckless.
     Congressman Sam Farr, a Democrat from California,
spoke on the House floor in support of the bill following
President Clinton's unexpected veto.
     "We need to keep America competitive. Technology
development depends on risk-taking. This bill allows risks
to be taken and rights to be protected. I was shocked by
this veto... I am going to vote to override it. I urge my
colleagues who supported it in the first instance to do so
in the latter."
     Securities legislation was designated as a priority
for the House Republican's "Contract With America" and has
since attracted strong bipartisan support in a political
climate focused on U.S. tort law reformation.
     Mr. Kenneth Glueck, Vice-president of Financial and
Regulatory Affairs for AEA said the organization was
stunned by President Clinton's veto.
     "It was not on anyone's radar screen," Glueck said.
"We were never given any indication."
     Mr. Kevin Richardson, Vice-president of Government
Relations for the Electronics Industry Association,
another industry group, was not surprised by the veto.
   "In the president's weighing of a variety of factors
both substantive and political, he came down on the wrong
side, in favor of the plaintiff bar rather than the
technology market."
     Richardson said he was equally delighted by the
prompt Congressional override as he was disappointed by
Clinton's veto.

PC SALES SOAR TO SENIORS

   PC companies are honing in on a new group of buyers -
people who are 55 plus.
     According to Census Bureau data, 22 percent of adults
over the age of 55 use personal computers, with the most
popular applications being word processing, home/personal
finance and telecommunications.
     The numbers of senior users are only increasing,
according to a recently released Times-Mirror poll, which
indicates a two point percentage gain from just 18 months
ago, totaling 600,000 users age 65 or older.
     The purchasing power of those over 55, who control 40
percent of all discretionary income, has prompted vendors
to try to entice more seniors to the PC marketplace.
     Packard Bell conducted a recent survey of 1,700 PC
households, finding that senior citizens spend more time
on the computer than all other family members, an average
of 12 hours per week conducting personal business. The
survey also found that senior citizens go on-line 3.9
hours a week.
     Packard Bell's arch-rival, Compaq Computer Corp. last
month introduced an advertising campaign with television
spots featuring a pair of older women using a Compaq
system to fax recipes to each other.
   A spokeswoman from Compaq's marketing group said this
does not indicate a move by the company to specifically
target the senior citizen demographic, although the Wall
Street Journal cited a Compaq survey which determined that
11 percent of purchasers of consumer models in the first
half of 1995 were over the age of 55.
     Acer is currently running a print ad featuring an
older male user on-line with the caption, "I surf with my
friends
in Orlando and Sun City." Both these cities are in
Florida's retirement belt.
     An Acer spokesperson said the company "definitely
recognizes that the senior citizen market is booming."
     Acer also recently partnered with Intel to provide
     100
Pentium-processor-based Aspire computers to SeniorNet, a
San Francisco-based non-profit organization, which boasts
nearly 19,000 members and 78 centers nation-wide since its
formation a decade ago.
     Free classes offered through SeniorNet have trained
more than 65,000 older adults age 55 to 101 across the
U.S. Founder and president Dr. Mary Furlong attributes the
success of SeniorNet to "steady growth of on-line use by
seniors... (we) expect this to grow as our population ages
and as we continue adding more services and features to
SeniorNet."
     The volunteer-operated SeniorNet estimates that
computer use among the elderly population has increased by
15 percent on an annual basis since 1990.
     In coordination with Furlong's organization, the
Microsoft Network launched SeniorNet on-line in late
August 1995.
Pathways to Learning, the primary SeniorNet service,
functions as an on-line educational series focusing on
computer literacy and the Internet.
     SeniorNet also encourages senior users to compile
living archives, personal on-line accounts and
perspectives on historical events available for access by
younger users.
     Every major on-line provider offers senior-specific
services, from Prodigy's Seniors Bulletin Board to
CompuServe's Retirement Living Forum.
     World Wide Web sites established for senior
cybersurfers aim at providing educational, medical and
financial resources from a variety of sponsors.

3-D WORLD DEBUTS ON THE WEB

     The newly available commercial three-dimensional
virtual reality environment for the World Wide Web -- the
first of its kind -- is touted by its makers to jump-start
electronic commerce through glossy graphics and greater
customer appeal.
     The environment, called UB World, was created by
California-based UB Networks Inc. -- an independently
operated subsidiary of Tandem Computers.  UB World is a
futuristic three-dimensional environment where multiple
visitors can take on the characteristics of a generic
avatar or a 3-D symbol and traverse a myriad of pathways
through an evolving community.  UB 'virtual employees'
will assist in answering questions or giving directions.
Users can also launch off to other Web sites in UB World.
The environment employs text, graphic and embedded video
clips.
     "In a world of information overload, it is
increasingly difficult to find the data you need," said
Tim Wild, vice president of interactive initiatives for UB
Networks.  "We are providing a 3-D reality-based context,
so visitors can navigate easily with the help of signposts
rather than getting lost in a labyrinth of HTML pages."
     But the world is also a front-end advertisement for
UB Network's line of products.
     UB World will also promote 3-D technology and UB
Network products.  The 'world' has an Interactive
Initiatives pyramid where visitors can go and find out
about the technology behind other electronic offerings
from UB Networks.  Users can also retrieve information
about the UB line of products from the Services pavilion,
whose
architecture is inspired by the company's GeoLan/500
product.  The pavilion will automatically link into the UB
home page.
     Interested parties can download UB World free of
charge from UB Networks' Website at http://www.ub.com.
The product will also become available on CD-Rom in the
near future.

GIGABIT ETHERNET PLANS IN THE WORKS

     Sun Microsystems, Compaq Computer Corp. and 3Com
Corp. are hedging their bets that Gigabit Ethernet is to
be the next hottest backbone technology on the market.
     Gigabit Ethernet - which would provide a ten-fold
performance increase over 100 megabit Ethernet - is still
in the idea stage, said Les Poltrack, director of network
connectivity marketing for Sun Microsystems.
     Though there are no designs or standards in place at
this point, Poltrack said that Gigabit Ethernet is seen as
potentially attractive backbone technology for users with
Ethernet networks already in place. At the same time,
Gigabit Ethernet would be a technology nicely complemented
by companies who have started slowly incorporating
Asynchronous Transfer Mode into the network.
      In short, Ethernet could become for users a
technology applicable to the desktop all the way up to the
backbone, with 10 megabit up to one gigabit transmission
speeds.
   The idea of Gigabit Ethernet has been proposed to the
IEEE as a LAN standard, but there reportedly is still not
a working group in place to draft the standard. The
standards process could take years to complete, let alone
crafting a viable specification. Sun could not provide any
timeline for when Gigabit Ethernet might reach the market.
     Achieving Gigabit Ethernet is at least a couple of
years away, said Michael Howard, president of consultancy
Infonetics research.
     Work has been done in the laboratory to achieve
gigabit speeds, but at very short distances. As such,
feasibility of Gigabit Ethernet is still not a sure thing.
     Although ATM is slated to finally take off in late
1996, the concept of Gigabit Ethernet would be a nice
alternative for companies looking to stick with an
existing infrastructure.
     "The real ATM market has not hit yet," Howard said.
"There are a lot of smaller and medium sized companies and
portions of larger companies that are counting on doing as
much as they can with Ethernet. [With Gigabit Ethernet]
users have the hope that they can built very fast
backbones with Ethernet."

MICROSOFT BACK IN THE GAME WITH INTERNET PLAN

There were a few surprises when Microsoft finally
announced its Internet game plan.
    It included an intention to license technology from
competitors Sun Microsystems and Oracle Corp., and the
promise of creating a "community" on the Internet with its
Microsoft Network (MSN) on-line network.
     Microsoft has detailed a number of plans which it
hopes will help paint Netscape and others out of the
picture. In the broadest sense, Microsoft's strategy is
one of integration.
     For example, it has plans to incorporate Internet
access into virtually all of its "mainstay" PC products
such as Windows 95, Windows NT and 3.1, Excel and
Microsoft Word. Microsoft also plans to deliver to users
of Microsoft and Macintosh computer systems free Internet
software. The Internet will become an integral part of
Microsoft's development in every area.
   "You won't see us having an Internet division," said
Microsoft's CEO Bill Gates at a industry briefing. "That
would be like having an electricity division. The Internet
has become pervasive in everything we are doing."
     On to Explorer, Microsoft's Internet browser: the
company is touting several key features with Explorer that
make it a superior technology over competitors.
     For example, multi-threading and progressive
rendering features help with responsiveness of the user
interface to complex Web pages. A proprietary Place Holder
Mode allows for text to be downloaded quickly and easily
before graphics are so users do not have to entertain
themselves in the meantime.
     Unlike other browsers, Explorer supports advanced
multimedia and 3-D capabilities. Explorer 2.0 includes
inline AVIs for embedded videos, scrolling banners,
background audio, context-sensitive menus, as well as
inline Virtual Reality Markup Language for fast viewing of
3-D objects and animation.     The company has also made
official an intent to deliver its previously named
"Blackbird" electronic publishing tool kit to users in the
first part of 1996.
     With a release expected in March of next year,
Blackbird, now renamed "Internet Studio," will serve as a
tool for site developers to create interactive multimedia
pages, without any programming or HTML coding. With
Internet Studio, developers can expect the task of
creating similar static web pages to be made easier, and
at the same time be able to jazz up those pages that need
be more snazzy, said Mike Conte, group manager for
Microsoft's personal systems division.
     "It turns out a lot of people are just using text
editors to create content for their site which is a very
primitive way of doing it," Conte said. "This is a big
step forward, it allows you to create a rich interactive
site without having to know HTML or how to program."
     Sound, graphics, animation and other features are
easily integrated simply by dragging and dropping objects.
The design of a page is essentially separated from the
content of a page, so designers can easily "refresh"
information on a page with little effort. Microsoft claims
that with Internet Studio, businesses are expected to save
time and money it terms of web site maintenance.
     "With Internet Studio, you can create a format once
and simply flow new content into it without having to re-
author your site," Conte said. "It takes care of creating
links between stories and so on... its quite a time saver
for creating stories of equal impact but also have some
tools for creating more exciting sites than you are able
to do today."
     Finally, another "bit" of Internet news: Microsoft's
just announced partnership with the National Broadcasting
Company to deliver an interactive computer news service
and a 24-hour news channel.
     The venture, which from the onset looks to cost in
the whereabouts of $420 million, holds the promise of
providing comprehensive news and a plethora of archived
information for the viewer. Data such as photographs,
videos, historical data and like will be available for
viewers wanting more than just a 30 second news bite.
     According to industry analyst Rob Enderle with
research
firm Giga Information Group, Microsoft's just-revised
Internet strategy is a giant step in the right direction.
Though Netscape is in the headlines now, Enderle warned
that there is still plenty of room for other vendors to
capitalize on the promise of the Internet.
     "The Net is still very new as far as a cultural
mainstay or icon," Enderle said. "The final impact is
still a long way off. We've got a number of years to flush
it out and for vendors to emerge. Netscape was one of the
early players, but its not often that the early players
survive the entire generation."
     At the same time Enderle gave Microsoft high marks
for its company-wide involvement and effort surrounding
the Internet. "It's a level of commitment for a company
Microsoft's size that's pretty unheard of. I think about
six or seven months ago they were completely off track but
they've done a great job of refocusing."

CABLE TELEVISION INDUSTRY EXTENDS TECHNOLOGY TO THE NET

    With lines running past 97% of residential America,
cable TV has the potential to put the Internet at the
fingertips of anyone with a remote control at a speed
1,000 times faster than telephone lines.
     CableLabs, the American cable television industry's
research and development consortium, announced a move to
standardize modem connections with cable systems by April.
     At least 63 million sites already exist as part of
     the
half century-old cable TV infrastructure, which will have
to be overhauled and revamped in order to accommodate the
high market demand for set-top box technology.
     Mike Schwartz, vice-president of Communications,
describes the CableLabs project as a non-profit,
cooperative information clearing house and technology
watchdog.
     "We're not competing with anybody, frankly. We want
to foster an open process for standard specifications
which will bring production costs down."
     There are eight interfaces which CableLabs will
specify: the connection to the consumer's personal
computer; the consumer radio frequency interface,
connecting the cable network to the home; five interfaces
within the cable headend or distribution hub including
router and operation support system interfaces; and an
interface from the headend to wide area networks, to
include Internet backbones and other global data networks.
     CableLabs chairman Dr. John C. Malone acknowledges
that cable operators have already purchased thousands of
cable modems to date, however he says these modems are not
interoperable.
"We applaud the research that went into today's modems,
and obviously wish to use it to get into the marketplace
first. But in the next generation of modems, we look for
more commonality in cable so that vendors may enjoy mass
market sales."
   Plans to unveil the standard specifications for cable
modems, or set-top boxes, may not come early enough for
vendors and manufacturers. Those cable operators reluctant
to wait until April will not be disappointed.
     Motorola has already accepted 500,000 orders for its
CyberSURFER modems and Hewlett-Packard is also contracted
to produce 150,000 set-top boxes before the April
deadline.
    A resulting de facto standard from these models is
anticipated by Rick Lehtinen, senior analyst for In-Stat's
MultiMedia Group. He remains skeptical of CableLabs' April
deadline. According to Lehtinen, "In the face of
prevailing buzzes, I saw nothing to dance in the streets
about," at the
1995 Western Cable Show in Anaheim, California, where
CableLabs made the standardization announcement.
     Malone sees the new initiative on high-speed cable
data modems in a different light. In his announcement at
the Western Cable Show, Malone said "This international
specification will take the World Wide Web a step further,
bringing broadband interconnections into homes worldwide."
     However Lehtinen perceives difficulty in the
     modulation
and inception cable backbone which currently exists.
"There is a finite number of channels available through
cable, whereas wireless cable advanced modulation systems
and satellite systems have achieved phenomenal
penetration."
     Although coaxial connections offer 1,000 times the
bandwidth of the fastest available telephone network
connection, according to Lehtinen, this by no means
indicates a plethora of alternatives. He says that the
nation's cable TV network, which has primarily been used
for "downstream" or one-way transmissions, is subject to
interference from police scanners, CB radios and even
Christmas lights.
     A pilot scheme, Project Agora is designed to test
these and other problems in large-scale, "upstream" or two-
way use of set-top boxes. Continental Cablevision, the
fourth largest cable operator in the U.S., is sponsoring
the test, using Boston College faculty and students as a
focal group.
     Continental furnished 6,600 dormitories, 2,500
classrooms and 400 offices on the campus with cable modems
for a period of several months. The company found that on
line users prefer the speed of cable modems for functions
such as downloading graphics and massive files.
     Telephone companies are currently in the process of
launching a competitive alternative to cable modems,
offering a service known as ISDN, dedicated lines which
will carry digital data at higher speeds, but still not
comparable to the speed which set-top boxes provide.
     The question remains, however, who shall lead and
eventually dominate the cable TV industry's onramp to the
information super highway, exacting monthly tolls of
anywhere from $20 to $30 for leasing the modem alone.
Estimated rate projections fluctuate from $30 to $40 per
month for service providers, which the cable television
industry hopes to become.

DESKTOP VIDEOCONFERENCING STILL NOT SET TO TAKE OFF

   1995 was touted as the year desktop videoconferencing
would blossom as prices dropped and standards were
solidified.
   Not so and now some industry watchers are painting a
gloomy picture for the technology's future.
     The hardware and software costs for desktop
videoconferencing are falling, but analysts point to the
hidden costs of installing and managing videoconferencing
on the network as a source of discouragement amongst MIS
managers. More so, there are simply are not enough
applications available for companies to deem desktop
videoconferencing an essential component on the network.
     TeleSpan Publishing Corporation indicates there was a
slump in worldwide desktop videoconferencing shipments
from the second to third quarter of 1995: in the second
quarter, 19,693 units were shipped, whereas in the third
quarter, 17,176 units were shipped, a 12.8 percent drop.
     On the other hand, a wide angle look at the market
shows much more promise: TeleSpan reports that in the
third quarter of 1994, shipments totaled 7,013 - there has
been a 120 percent jump over the past year.
     Tom Pincince, analyst with Massachusetts based
research firm Forrester Research, said that desktop
videoconferencing has not taken off because it has not
become an essential part of conducting day to day
business. For the most part, such units are typically
installed for only the top 10 or so executives in a
company.
     "There is just not this compelling need for everyone
to go out and get it on their desktop," Pincince said.
"It's a really sexy application, but if you are an MIS
manager trying to figure out whether or not this is an
application that you want to deploy on thousands of
desktops...it's not hard to figure out the answer is no."
   A study conducted by Forrester further indicates that
desktop videoconferencing has a long way to go before
receiving universal acceptance. The company just presented
50 Fortune 1,000 data communications and
telecommunications managers with the following question:
"What would it take for you to put videoconferencing on
your LAN?"
    For the most part, responses indicated that lack of
applications, lack of bandwidth, and the high cost of
overhauling a network to include video to the desktop mean
desktop videoconferencing will not become prevalent on the
LAN for five years. Forrester concluded that even when it
does become commonplace, videoconferencing will not
transform business interaction.
     In terms of costs, Forrester estimates that in order
to successfully implement video at the desktop, total
costs to lay the foundation for videoconferencing will run
in the whereabouts of US$6,000 per seat. The costs include
not only the video equipment: camera, software and sound
equipment, but a router upgrade, "people time," a switched
workgroup, a video LAN/WAN gateway, and Pentium-class
machine with a fast monitor.
     "[Hesitancy] used to be about cost and complexity;
that has gotten fixed over time," Pincince said. "The real
issue is that there is a big hidden cost in LAN-based
videoconferencing. Even if they zero out the cost of the
desktop, there is still a significant infrastructure
cost."
     Other industry watchers say that though desktop
videoconferencing has been slow to gain momentum,
proliferation will take less than five years.
     Ultimately, the prices for the basic
hardware/software components will become so attractive
over the next few years that "everybody is going to jump
into [videoconferencing]," said Will Strauss, president of
research Forward Concepts. Now though, Strauss said market
growth has been "painfully slow," and Forward Concepts is
"in total dismay with the way things are going."
     Though companies like Forrester claim that there is a
high price to pay for video on the desktop, Strauss said
it is simply a matter of sacrificing quality. Users will
not in every case require the best possible conditions to
deploy videoconferencing.
     A survey conducted by Forward Concepts of more than
250 end users indicated that a majority of users will be
satisfied with video over the plain old telephone lines
(POTS) and will want video to the desktop as an option.
The company predicts that LAN pipelines and ISDN will
proliferate as well, and in the next three years two-way
cable TV will prove a popular videoconferencing pipeline
option.
   "We've got [interoperability] industry standards like
H.324 which will enable a lot of people to call up each
other and see some incredibly bad video," Strauss said.
"What we have found is nobody wants it
[videoconferencing], but everybody will use it if the
price is close to free."
     As it stands, basic software/hardware costs will
decline over the next few years, Strauss reports. This
year, Strauss predicts that the cost of a
videoconferencing "essentials" will be US$1,948. Next
year, that cost will be down to US$598, and by the year
2000, that will price will be around US$207, Strauss
claims.
     On the applications front, analysts have mixed
opinions of how and when desktop videoconferencing will be
useful. On one hand, Pincince emphasizes that "the
business applications where you need to see someone's face
are really limited." Even though data collaboration is
becoming a more popular reason to utilizing
videoconferencing equipment, analysts say the time spent
actually looking at one another on the screen is usually
very little. Still, many employees will desire
videoconferencing capabilities to avoid travel and to
maintain contact with key associates.
     Outside of a traditional business setting, desktop
videoconferencing will increasingly become an important
tool in specialized fields, such as for telemedicine
applications.
     Beyond staring at a jittery picture of business
partner's face, Forrester predicts in the future - beyond
the year 2000 - there will be more unique ways of
utilizing video to the desktop. For example, businesses
might create "virtual environments" somewhat like those
created for games like Doom where a number of players - or
in this case business partners - can interact by taking on
the persona of a character of a machine. Far out maybe,
but not far off, Forrester predicts.
   Of course, the vendors themselves do not admit to any
disappointing figures in terms of desktop
videoconferencing units. Intel, for example, says that the
next year, and years beyond look bright.
     Intel with its ProShare videoconferencing system,
along with companies PictureTel, Compression Labs Inc. and
the like are promising users increased functionality,
lowered prices and better computing power to deliver
higher quality systems this year - all over the globe.
     Intel, for example, says its videoconferencing units
have been deployed in around 28 countries across the globe
to date, including locations in North America, Latin
America, the Asia Pacific and European regions said Scott
Darling, director of marketing for Intel communications.
Many countries of course have a different level of
requirements based on factors like the sophistication of
the network.
     "There are subtleties in each country by media type
and other various factors," Darling said. "More
importantly, the critical thing to do is work with
customers around defining applications."
     "It's not a matter of going in and selling
conferencing as a broad, horizontal capability... it's
important to go in and talk about specific applications
and what the return on investment for those applications
is," he continued.
    Intel said in terms of a desktop videoconferencing
strategy, the whole point is to further make the PC a
"communicating PC," providing users with every possible
option to make communication easier. As such, video would
become as commonplace as the modem.
