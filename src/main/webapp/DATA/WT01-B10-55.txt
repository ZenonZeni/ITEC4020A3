We, ________________________ and _______________________ being husband and wife, voluntarily give our
consent and authorize, Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Georgia Baptist Medical Center, Paces Cryobank, their
officers, doctors, agents, employees, successors, and assigns and the IVF program personnel and associates to
perform cryopreservation.  As a result of our participation in the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre's and Dr.
Perloe's <b>IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF) program</b>, <b>GAMETE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER (GIFT)</b> program, or
<b>ZYGOTE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER (ZIFT)</b> program more eggs may be retrieved or pre-embryos form than Dr.
Perloe recommends be placed back into the woman's uterus or fallopian tubes.  Accordingly, we desire that surplus
eggs be fertilized and excessive pre-embryos be cryopreserved. <p>

<b>DEFINITIONS.</b>  As used in this <b>INFORMED CONSENT</b>, the following definitions shall apply:<p>

<b>"CRYOPRESERVATION"</b> is preservation by freezing.  In this case, cryopreservation refers to the
preservation by freezing of human pre-embryos.<p>

"A<b> PRE-EMBRYO"</b> is a fertilized egg, or ovum, that has divided to form a small number of simple cells, but
not specialized tissues.  At the pre-embryo stage of development each of these primitive cells is identical to
all other cells in the fertilized dividing egg.  Human pre-embryos are usually cryopreserved when they
consist of from one (l) to sixteen (l6) cells.<p>

<b>"IN VITRO FERTILIZATION"</b>  or "IVF" refers to the process whereby egg growth is stimulated in a woman,
the eggs are obtained from her ovary or ovaries, the eggs are then fertilized by her husband's sperm or by a
donor's sperm, in a laboratory, and the resulting pre-embryos are placed into a woman's uterus.<p>

<b>"GIFT"</b> is an acronym for <b>"GAMETE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER"</b>. Gametes are sperm and eggs. 
GIFT is a procedure in which eggs are obtained from a woman's ovary or ovaries by ultrasound guided
retrieval or by a procedure called a laparoscopy.  Then, during the same procedure, the eggs are placed
into the woman's fallopian tubes along with some of the husband's sperm or a donor's sperm.<p>

<b>"INTRAFALLOPIAN"</b> means "inside the fallopian tube", which is the normal site of fertilization.<p>
<b>
"ZIFT"</b> is an acronym for <b>ZYGOTE INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER. </b> Eggs are obtained and fertilized in a
fashion similar to IVF.  Twenty-four hours following retrieval, pre-embryos are transferred directly into the
fallopian tube during an outpatient surgery, laparoscopy. <b></b>

<b>"EMBRYO TRANSFER"</b> means the transfer of up to four or five pre-embryos into the uterine cavity. <p> 

<b>ABSENCE OF GUARANTEE</b><br>

We have been informed and understand and affirm that no guarantee or representation has been made to us that
the pre-embryos will survive the cryopreservation, or that pregnancy will be achieved utilizing this process.  We have
also been informed and understand that mechanical failures may occur at any point during the process resulting in
loss of the pre-embryos.<p>

<b>ALTERNATIVES FOR USE OF CRYOPRESERVATION OF PRE-EMBRYOS</b><br>

The cryopreserved pre-embryos may be placed in the uterus of the wife.  Alternatively, we may decide to donate
them to another individual or individuals, or we may authorize their disposal, or, if we fail or refuse to make a
decision, they may be discarded.<p>

If we choose to make our cryopreserved pre-embryos available for donation to another individual or individuals, we
will complete a questionnaire that deals with our physical characteristics, education, and both personal health and
family health.  We agree to have certain blood tests to confirm that we carry no communicable disease.  To the
extent required by law, both of us and the recipient individual or individuals will remain anonymous to each other. 
The recipient(s) will not be shown the actual questionnaires we have completed, but may receive information taken
from the questionnaires for assistance in making a decision regarding receipt of the pre-embryos.  
<p>
In the event of pre-embryo donation, we understand and agree that we will have no further claims or rights of any
kind or nature upon or to the pre-embryos or any offspring which may result therefrom. We expressly waive any and
all rights with respect to any offspring that may result from the pre-embryos.  We further understand and agree that
the recipient(s) of the pre-embryos will be deemed the parents and shall have all parental rights with respect to any
offspring which may result from the pre-embryos.  We understand that in the event we make our pre-embryos
available for donation to another individual or individuals, and:<p>

(i)	after reasonable time and effort has been expended no suitable recipient is available, or;<br>

(ii)	applicable law prohibits donation of pre-embryos, <p>

our pre-embryos will be disposed of, without notice to us or consent by us.  We expressly waive any and all rights to
the pre-embryos and authorize that they be disposed of if no suitable recipient is available or applicable law prohibits
donations of pre-embryos.  We have been informed and understand that in the event the pre-embryos are discarded
no offspring will result from them.<p>

<b>CHANGE OF DECISION</b><br>

We understand that after we have made our decision regarding the use or donation of the cryopreserved pre-
embryos, we have no right, at any time in the future, to change any decision about use or donation of the pre-
embryos or their disposal.  <p>
<b>
INDECISION, SEPARATION, DIVORCE, DEATH</b><br>

In the event of our disagreement or our failure or refusal to make a decision, for whatever reason, or our separation,
or divorce, or the death of either of us, the use or disposal of such pre-embryos shall be in accordance with the
applicable provisions in paragraph titled <i>MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF CRYOPRESERVED PRE-
EMBRYOS </i>

When we and the program of Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Paces Cryobank, Mark Perloe, M.D., and Roman
Pyrzak, Ph.D. have determined that the cryopreserved pre-embryos are to be placed in the wife's uterus, they will be
thawed and placed in her uterus one (l) to four (4) at a time in subsequent normal ovarian cycles.<b></b>  

Only pre-embryos considered by Mark Perloe, M.D., and or Roman Pyrzak, Ph.D. to be potentially viable, using
reasonable medical judgment, will be transferred.  We have been informed and understand that placement of the
pre-embryos into the uterus requires a normal uterine lining and close synchronization to the normal process of
ovulation.  Synchronization may require monitoring by frequent blood or urine tests of the wife, and ultrasound
examination of the wife, and the pre-embryos will only be thawed and so placed into the uterus only if the cycle is
determined to be normal in all respects by Mark Perloe, M.D.  <p>

<b>PROCEDURES IN EVENT PREGNANCY IS ACHIEVED</b><br>
 If a pregnancy occurs from intrauterine transfer of cryopreserved pre-embryos, prenatal diagnosis, amniocentesis or
chorionic villus sampling, may be recommended for the purpose of determining whether the fetus is chromosomally
normal.  We have been informed and understand that prenatal diagnosis may detect some, but will not detect all
abnormalities that may be present.  <p>

Given current medical research, there is no present indication of an increase in the rate of anomalies among infants
born after successful uterine transfer of cryopreserved pre-embryos, nor any indication of increased abnormalities
after cryopreservation from extensive experience in animals. Nevertheless, until large numbers of children have
been born as a result of the cryopreservation process, it will not be possible to ascertain that the rate of
abnormalities truly does not differ from that in spontaneous conceptions.  We knowingly accept this risk of
abnormality in any child so conceived through the pre-embryo cryopreservation procedure.<p>

<b>COSTS</b><br>
We have discussed in detail with representatives of Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre and Mark Perloe, M.D. the
financial aspects of cryopreservation of human pre-embryos.  We understand that cryopreservation of human pre-
embryos is an intricate and time-consuming process.  We understand and acknowledge that it is solely our
responsibility to pay the full costs of freezing, storing and thawing our surplus pre-embryos.  <p>

We agree to inform the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre and Mark Perloe, M.D. of any change in our address
occurring while we have cryopreserved pre-embryos in storage. We further agree that if any amount owed by us or
the designated recipient in the event of death of one partner, separation or divorce remains unpaid for more than
one (1) year, the pre-embryos are to be:<p>
<i><dd>a.	_____________  Donated.  	____________(initials of husband and wife)<p>

<dd>b.	_____________  Disposed of.  	____________(initials of husband and wife)<p></i>

without any further notice to us or consent by us and we understand that we are still responsible for payment of an
outstanding balance.<p>

<b>MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF CRYOPRESERVED PRE-EMBRYOS</b><br>
We hereby express our decision regarding the management and disposal of our cryopreserved pre-embryos in the
following situations:<p>

In the event of the <b>death of the husband</b>, we wish our pre-embryos to be:  <p>

<cite><dd>a.	Placed in the uterus of my surviving wife, if she so desires.<br>

<dd>	____________________________(initials of husband and wife)</i><p>


<b>LEGAL RIGHTS OF HUSBAND AND WIFE UNDER GEORGIA LAW</b><br>

We understand that as of the date of this instrument the legal rights of husbands and wives, and of other parties,
with regard to the use, donation and disposition of human pre-embryos resulting from IVF, GIFT or ZIFT have not
been statutorily or judicially determined in the State of Georgia.  In the event it is later determined that any of the
selected pre-embryo uses, donations or disposition outlined in this Informed Consent is illegal, then such selected
use, donation or disposition shall be deemed null and void.  <p>

In the event either the husband or wife contests the legality of any provision of this Informed Consent with respect to
the use, donation or disposition of the pre-embryos, then, in that event, the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre and
Mark Perloe, M.D. shall preserve the frozen pre-embryos at the expense of the contesting spouse. And, in the event
of failure of the contesting spouse to make any payment due for more than one (1) year, it is agreed that the said
pre-embryos may be disposed of by the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre without further notice to us or consent
by us and we understand that we are still responsible for payment of an outstanding balance.<p>
  

<b>PRE-EMBRYO STORAGE WILL NOT BE BEYOND THE 50TH BIRTHDAY OF THE WIFE</b><br>

We understand that in any event the pre-embryos will not be stored beyond the 
50th birthday of the wife, at which time the embryos will be:<p>

<i><dd>a.	Donated.<br>
<dd>______________________________(initials of husband and wife)<p>

<dd>b.	Disposed of without further notice to us or consent by us.<br>
<dd>______________________________(initials of husband and wife<p></i>

<b>SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD PROGRAM</b><br>

We understand that if the wife has a hysterectomy or change in the health of her uterus as to preclude pregnancy,
currently the only known remaining alternative, other than donation or disposal of the pre-embryos, would be to
achieve pregnancy through a surrogate mother to carry the pregnancy.  We have been advised that the Atlanta
Reproductive Health Centre and Mark Perloe, M.D. does not currently have a "surrogate mother program," and may
or may not have such a program in the future.  However,  the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre and Mark Perloe,
M.D. will cooperate, to the extent permitted by law and the policies of the Georgia Baptist Medical Center Hospital
Commission, in the transfer of the pre-embryos to a physician of our choice for surrogate mother use.  In such an
event, we agree to pay all costs related to the cryopreservation, transfer and other related costs and expenses. <p>

<b>SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE</b><br>

We understand that the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Paces Cryobank, Dr. Roman Pyrzak and Mark Perloe,
M.D. and the other personnel involved in our care are not obligated to proceed with pre-embryo uterine placement, if,
on the basis of scientific evidence, Mark Perloe, M.D., in his sole judgment, believes that the risks of proceeding
outweigh the benefits.  The Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre and Mark Perloe, M.D. also reserve the right to
terminate their participation in the human pre-embryo cryopreservation project at any time.  In the event of such
termination, all reasonable efforts will be made to arrange for use of or disposition of the pre-embryos  remaining in
storage according to our wishes.  In the absence of directions from us within a period of ninety (90) days from written
notification, the frozen pre-embryos will be disposed of, without further notice to us or consent by us. <p>

<b>DISPOSAL</b><br>

Any disposal of our frozen pre-embryos directed or authorized by this document shall be in accordance with the
procedures then in effect at the Atlanta Reproductive Health Centre, Georgia Baptist Medical Center and Paces
Cryobank. <p> 
<b>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</b><br>

Should we have questions or require further information regarding cryopreservation of human pre-embryos, financial
matters, or our cryopreserved pre-embryos, we can obtain answers to our questions and further information by
contacting Roman Pyrzak, Ph.D. or Mark Perloe, M.D. at (404)265-3662.  Our participation in the Atlanta
Reproductive Health Centre's human pre-embryo cryopreservation program will be kept in confidence to the extent
required by law.<p>
