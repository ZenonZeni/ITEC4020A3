<H2>SEA ICE AND ICEBERGS </H2>

The <a href="rsghome.htm">SPRI Remote Sensing Group</a> carries out
research into the applications of remote sensing methods to the polar
marine environment, especially sea ice and icebergs. Our research projects
have used both radar altimeter and passive microwave data to measure sea
ice concentration.  More recently, the RSG contributed to the
international <b>IPAP</b> (Ice Pilot Applications Project) with the aim of
showing that spaceborne synthetic aperture radar data could be used in a
timely manner (within a few hours of collection by the satellite) to
provide sea ice and iceberg data for operational use in polar waters. This
project, which was a collaboration between SPRI, GEC Marconi Research
Centre, SAIC Science and Engineering Ltd, BP, Canarctic Shipping (Canada),
Nunaoil (Denmark) and the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute
(Russia), was managed by the UK Defence Research Agency on behalf of the
British National Space Centre. It involved the development and validation
of new algorithms for the detection of the ice edge, measurement of ice
concentration, and the detection of icebergs, among other tasks. The
system is now <a href="http://www.demon.co.uk/raids/demos.html">operational
</a>, using ERS satellite data.<br> <b>(Images here soon)</b>

In 1995 the RSG began an associated <a href="dlf.htm">project</a> to
develop a detailed microscopic understanding of sea ice, with the ultimate
goal of improving the parameterisation of sea ice in global climate
models. It complements the work of the <a href="../sig/sighome.htm">SPRI Sea 
Ice Group</a>.  This project, which is funded by the UK Meteorological 
Office <a href="http://www.meto.govt.uk/sec5/sec5pg1.html">Hadley 
Centre</a> under its Gassiot studentship scheme, is being undertaken by 
<a href="http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/people/dlf20/home.htm">Daniel Feltham</a>
in collaboration with Dr Grae Worster of the University of Cambridge 
<a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/">Department of Applied Mathematics and
Theoretical Physics</a>.
