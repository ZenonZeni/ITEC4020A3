This course is taught jointly by the Department of Food Science
and Technology and the Department of Agricultural Economics and
Management. The aim of the course is to provide the student with
a broad understanding of the technical, managerial and marketing
issues within the food industry. It contains academically rigorous
analysis in the fields of food engineering, management and the
economics of food marketing policy.
<p>
The course is of four years duration with a structure as shown
in the following table.  Students spend a minimum of three periods
training in industry as part of the course.

<b>Industrial placements</b> may be anywhere in the UK and also in many other European countries.  The University is part of  two EU schemes, Leonardo and Socrates, which support the exchange of staff and students between participating institutions.  There are occasional opportunities for training outside Europe. The Department arranges the placements taking into account the students'preferences. Normally students are paid a salary by the company with whom they are training. Most companies appoint a member of their staff to supervise the student during the placement.  Normally a member of the academic staff of the University Department will visit each student during each placement. Reports on the training are made by the student, the company and the visiting academic and on the basis of these reports the student's performance is assessed and this assessment is taken into account at the end of the course
when decisions regarding the class of degree to be awarded are being made.
<p>
Further information about industrial training is available from our <a href="/workexp/workexp.htm">Industrial Training Office</a>.
<P>
<b>The time spent in the University</b> is organised into three parts and the subjects are grouped into modules.  An outline of the course and the topics studied is as follows:

Trade, European Policy, Third World development. The options available
may change from year to year.
<P>
<B>Extended Essay</B><br>
Students undertake a special study on a
topic to be agreed by them and their Essay Supervisors. The study,
which is allocated two modules in term 7 and 1 in term 8, is presented
in the form of an essay (of not more than 10,000 words) by the
end of term 8.
<P>
<B>Teaching</B><br>
Students attend lectures and participate
in tutorials and seminars. The lectures in Process and Food Engineering
are supported by practical work in the processing laboratory,
and other classes include workshops e.g. in Quantitative Methods.
<P>
<B>Assessment</B><br>
There is a formal written examination
at the end of Part 1. Students must pass this in order to progress
through the rest of the course. In the event of failure in the
first attempt each subject may be retaken once. There is no formal
examination at the end of Part 2. Modules are assessed throughout
Part 2. Students who do not perform satisfactorily in the modular
assessments may be required to take a written examination. Modules
are also assessed throughout Part 3 of the course. There is a
formal written examination at the end of the course. The class
of degree awarded to each student will based on consideration
of the results of the modular assessments in Parts 2 and 3, the
results of the final examination, the assessment of the essay
and the industrial training.
<P>
<B>Sponsorship and prizes</B><br>
A number of companies offer some financial support to students undertaking this course. There are prizes awarded to the top students in each part of the course.
<P>
<B>Entry requirements</B><br>
Two, preferably three, A-level passes (or AS equivalents) one of which must be in a science subject or mathematics. GCSE/O-level mathematics is also required. The minimum grades required are CDD. Good attainments in other courses such as International Baccalaureate. BTEC, GNVQ or Access courses, in appropriate subjects, will be considered.
<p>
<b>Career opportunities</b><br>
The multidisciplinary nature of the course, together with the industrial training, equip our graduates for a wide variety of careers in the food and related industries.  Opportunities occur in the manufacturing sector in production management, marketing, buying, selling, quality assurance and research and development.  Many of the large retailing companies employ our graduates in marketing, and buying or to liaise with their suppliers on the quality of their products, the conditions under which they are manufactured and in new product development.  Some graduates are employed by companies who supply the food industry with ingredients, equipment and packaging. Other opportunities arise in government institutions, with local authorities and in teaching.  Some graduates go on to undertake postgraduate studies here in Reading or in other UK or overseas Universities.
<p>
<b>Other courses</b><br>
The Departments offer undergraduate courses in Agricultural Economics (3 yrs),  Biotechnology (4yrs), Chemistry and Food Science (3yrs), Food Marketing Economics (3yrs), Food Science (3yrs), Food Science, Food Economics and Marketing (3yrs) and in Food Technology (4yrs).  They also offer MSc courses in Agricultural Economics, Food Science, Food Technology and in Food and Agricultural Biotechnology as well as research courses leading to MPhil and PhD degrees.
