<H2>Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism</H2>
<HR>

In this OHE report Jane Griffen outlines how post-surgical deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are estimated
to have cost the National Health Service between &#163;205 and &#163;225 million in 1993. This estimate does not include the
costs incurred by the patients and their families. Indeed, if all the patients at high risk of developing a post-surgical DVT
(ie. those aged over 45 years and undergoing an operation associated with a high incidence of thrombosis) had received adequate prophylaxis the NHS would have made a cost saving of between &#163;35 and &#163;85 million and the number of deaths due to post surgical pulmonary embolism would probably have been reduced by more than 400, according to this analysis.

Yet, despite the fact that the major risk factors for DVT of age, immobility and certain forms of surgery are well known
among the medical profession and have been recognised for many years, less than half (46 per cent) of high risk surgical patients
appear to be receiving any form of prophylaxis. For some patients, particularly those undergoing brain surgery, it is possible that
the risks of using thrombolytic prophylaxis, such as excessive bleeding, outweigh the benefits of preventing deep vein thrombosis.
However, there are other non-pharmaceutical methods of prophylaxis such as elasticated stockings and according to the sample quoted
in the National Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths (CEPOD, 1995), only 17 per cent of neurosurgery patients were
given these.

The use of thrombolytic prophylaxis for the prevention of DVT provides a classic example of clinical and cost-effectiveness
evidence about a therapy not being put into practice. At a time when evidence-based medicine is receiving considerable emphasis
in the NHS, it would appear from this research, that much could be achieved in terms of cost savings and health gain if prophylactic
measures were implemented for surgical patients at high risk of developing a DVT.
