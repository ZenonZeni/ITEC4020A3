<h2>A Typical Pergonal/Humegon/Metrodin Cycle</h2>

<B>Cycle Day 1: </B>Call 265-3662 and make an appointment to start
you daily injections.  You will need to schedule an appointment
for a baseline ultrasound sometime between 7:30 a.m. and 8:30
a.m. You may schedule your ultrasound appointment for cycle day
1, 2, or 3. (weekdays only)
<P>
<B>Cycle Day 2: </B>No appointment or treatment necessary.
<P>
<B>Cycle Day 3: </B>A brief office visit to have an  ultrasound
is required (if not performed on CD1 or CD2).  Injections start
on the eve of CD3 and  usually continue for 5 to 12 days.  The
number of injections and dosage of medication you receive will
depend upon your individual response.  The injection should be
given at approximately the same time every evening. (4-8 p.m.)
<P>
<B>Cycle Day 4-6:</B>     Daily injections to be taken as ordered.

<P>
<B>Cycle Day 7: </B>You will have an ultrasound between 7:30 and
8:30 a.m.  Depending on the results of the ultrasound, we may
draw your first estradiol (blood) level.  Ultrasound examinations
and estradiol levels will be repeated every one to two days until
the follicle(s) have developed enough so that HCG may be given.
 HCG is an injection taken once in the afternoon or evening. 
Be sure to take this injection promptly at the designated time.
This visit may be delayed in subsequent cycles if we can predict
when your follicles may be ready. 
<P>
<B>HCG + 18 Hrs: </B>If indicated, an insemination will be scheduled
for approximately 7:30 a.m. Your husband will be asked to provide
a specimen.  Processing varies and may take 30-60 minutes. In
some cases a single insemination is performed 36 hours after HCG
injection. 
<P>
<B>HCG + 42 Hrs: </B>The insemination may be repeated. 
<P>
<B>HCG + 1-14 Days: </B>Progesterone vaginal suppositories, oral
progesterone or additional hCG injections may be ordered. 
<P>
<B>HCG + 5-7 Days: </B>You may have a follow-up ultrasound and
serum progesterone to confirm ovulation. 
<P>
<B>Pregnancy Test: </B>You can perform a urine hCG test at home
ten days after your final hCG injection or 12 days after the last
insemination whichever is later. 
<P>
<B>NOTE: </B>If your period starts on Friday, you must come in
<U>that day</U> for an ultrasound.  If you start on Saturday,
you must come in Monday (Day 3).
