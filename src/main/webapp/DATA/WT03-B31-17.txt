   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. <6752> is to use its
professional news DVCPRO model digital video camera (DVC) as to
spark a significant increase in sales of professional image
equipment to broadcasters, CATV operations, and large-scale in-
house users. The System Development Division is to expand system
operations, with targeted sales of professional image systems of
150 billion yen by FY98. Installation and maintenance specialist
subsidiaries are soon to be established, providing for smoothly
interconnected R&D, manufacturing and sales, and maintenance.

Sony Develops New Shock Absorbant Packaging Material


   Sony Corp. <6758>, together with Rengo Co., Ltd. <3941>, has
developed a new type of cushioning material using waste paper.
The "Cellmold" material has the same shock absorbency as
styrofoam, and will be mass produced from the spring. It will be
used first as packaging material for tape recorders. The new
material can be collected after use and recycled for subsequent
reuse as either packaging or in other products that include
waste paper.

Sumitomo Electric Moves to 6in GaAs Wafers


   Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. <5802> has succeeded in
developing a practical 6in GaAs wafer, and will begin sample
shipments in early 1996 followed by the set-up of mass
production during 1997 and full-scale sales in the spring of
1998. The company utilizes its independently developed vapor
pressure Czochralski (VPS) method allowing the formation of 6in
GaAs wafers in an arsenic atmosphere, providing consistent
quality better than that of 4in wafers.

TDK to Sell Reverse Import Video Tapes


   Starting from April, TDK <6762> will take its domestically
manufactured half finished magnetic tapes (originals),
incorporate them into home use VHS casettes at factories in
Thailand and then import them back to Japan.  A little over 20%
of the domestic monthly sales volume corresponding to 1 million
reels will be switched over to these imports.  This will be the
first time since 1977, when it first commenced the sale and
manufacture of home use video tapes, that they will be imported
and sold.  This is one link in the chain in the reconstruction
of the recording medium (media) industry which is now suffering
from unprofitability.  For reasons having to do with secure
procurement and cost reduction, originals manufactured
domestically will be assembled at TDK Thailand.  The sale of
these imports will commence after April.  Although the last
couple of  years had seen a vigorous marketing war unfold in the
domestic video tape market which had included imported products,
TDK had managed to continue producing 100% domestically by means
of concentrating production facilities

Nippon Columbia in JV in China for Audio Equipment


   Nippon Columbia <6791> will soon embark upon a joint venture
in China for the manufacture of audio equipment.  As one link in
the chain of the Hitachi Group's managerial strategy, it will
manufacture a whole audio product line including mini-components
and karaoke machines by teaming up with a local firm in Fukien
province with which Hitachi has established a cooperative
relationship for joint TV production.  The amount of paid in
capital as well as the percentage of contributory financing is
still under adjustment but it expects to settle the joint
venture contract and commence production in the spring.
Although Columbia is producing audio equipment in China on a
consignment basis, they will solidify their footing in this
growth market by building a factory at their own expense.  By
manufacturing in China, the Hard Division's 40% overseas
production ratio will be raised to over 50% in 1996.

Fuji Electric Bumps Overseas Procurement 50%


   In a new-year announcement by the president of Fuji Electric
<6504>, the company expects to increase overseas procurement of
materials by 50%, to the value of 4.5 billion yen, in fiscal
1996.  Anticipating a long-term trend in yen appreciation,
management has determined to deepen ties with overseas
facilities, including a plant producing small, industrial-use
motors in Dalian, China, to enhance cost effectiveness.  This
move should yield a four-to-five percent improvement in the
sales-to-current profit ratio.  The company will also procure
raw materials, such as copper, iron and aluminum.

Olympus Optical Targeting Profitability at Rate of US$1 = 80 Yen


   Olympus Optical <7733> aims to restructure its R&D and
manufacturing systems by FY98, to ensure profitability even at
an exchange rate of US$1 = 80 yen.  The company, which relied on
exports for more than 60% of its sales, realized the importance
of an exchange-rate-resistant strategy during the first half of
FY95, when yen appreciation was rampant.  The manufacturer's
three- year management plant includes measures the company will
employ to achieve this profitability.  For example, by FY98
Olympus Optical plans to increase its overseas production ratio
to 80%, compared with 65% at present.

computer monitor application prototype 13.3in TFT type LCD
featuring an angle of visibility of 140 degrees, both
horizontally and vertically. Sales are to begin from mid-1996.
The new display has a depth of 21.5cm, half that of a comparable
CRT, and provides high-precision video images with no line
flicker. The price has yet to be announced.

Profit Increases for March Term at 2 Bearing Manufacturers


   For 2 manufacturers of steel balls for bearings the outlook
for the March 1996 term is for profit and income increases due
to increased demand from makers of household appliances and
small PC peripherals.  Current profits for Amatsuji Steel Ball
<6475> are expected to show a 30% increase over the previous
term to 3.4 billion yen while Tsubakimoto Precision Products
<6477> is expected to show a 26% increase to 2.7 billion yen.
The two companies, due to their no debt management style, will
show financial income with decreased profit margins due to the
reduction in interest rates while securing profit increases as a
result of rises in operating rates and rationalized
manufacturing processes.  For Amatsuji, there will be increases
in shipments of steel balls for industrial arts equipment as
well as export increases to SE Asia in addition to its PC
shipments.  Gross sales are expected to increase 9% to 20.8
billion yen while sales profits are expected to expand 43% to
3.2 billion yen.  For Tsubakimoto Precision Products, exports to
Europe and ball screws for industrial arts machines are expected
to increase.  With gross sales increasing 10% to 14.5 billion
yen sales profits are expected to show a 31% increase to 2.4
billion yen.

NEC Consigns Sparc Production


   NEC <6701> will produce Sun Microsystem's Sparc, the RISC MPU
hearts of such items as workstations.  This consignment is
linked to increased orders of ASICs for Sparc.  NEC will acquire
Sparc design data and manufacturing technology from Sparc
Technology Business, Sun's semiconductor division.  The company
plans to start production of low- cost, 64b RISC MPUs for Sparc
WSs at its Kumamoto facility in 1996.  Monthly output will be
several thousand, 8-inch silicon wafer conversions.  NEC hopes
that with the consigned technology the company will accumulate
the necessary capabilities to fabricate peripheral ICs and
expand ASIC operations.

Hitachi to Enter Full Production of Semiconductors in SE Asia


   Hitachi <6501> is getting into Malaysia with a South Korean
semiconductor maker, the first time Japanese and Korean
companies are doing so, and into Singapore with Nippon Steel
<5401>, that company's first overseas semiconductor venture.
Total investment, including construction of pre-assembly
factories for semiconductor fabrication, hovers at the 230
billion yen mark.  Production of 16Mb  and 64Mb DRAMs will begin
in 1998.  The facility in Malaysia will give Hitachi integrated
production capacity there, since the company already operates a
local plant for pre- assembly processes, and will reinforce the
company's supply capabilities in the rapidly growing
semiconductor markets of Southeast Asia.

New Line for Nikon Film Scanners


   Nikon <7731> has embarked on increased production of film
scanners, which transfer images from film to PCs.  A new line at
the company's Ibaraki-based lens subsidiary will help boost
monthly output to the 3,000- unit level in January.  Nikon is
faced with a hollowing out of camera operations, as camera sales
falter and the company shifts production overseas, but
skyrocketing growth in PCs and peripheral equipment has
reinvigorated domestic operations.  The Ibaraki plant, with
about 1,000 employees, had transferred lens operations to a Thai
facility, but the investment of several tens of millions of yen
has allowed the subsidiary to branch out into not only scanner
production to complement new, semiconductor stepper activities.
