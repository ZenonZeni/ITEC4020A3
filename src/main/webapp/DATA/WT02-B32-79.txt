<h4>Progress on Amending the Miscellaneous Additives Directive</h4>

There have been further discussions on the proposed amendment to the Directive 95/2 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners.  The MAFF letter reports discussions held on 9 and 13 January.
<p>
Over the two days all aspects of the proposal were discussed, together with various requests for additional entries put forward by the Member States and the Commission.  In many cases the discussion was inconclusive and a further meeting of the Working Group is planned for 30 January.  The intention is to reach an agreed Common Position at the Internal Market Council on 13 March, subject to prior receipt of the European Parliament's first reading opinion.
<p>
The letter records the main points of the discussion - mainly specific requests for new or extended uses of additives.  Details will not be given here and MAFF should be contacted for further information.  One point is worth noting - the Commission tabled additional proposed entries for two new additives:  E459 beta-cyclodextrine and E425 Konjac (i) Konjac gum, (ii) Konjac glucomannane..
<p>

<h4>Amendment to Sweeteners Directive Adopted</h4>

At the Environment Council meeting on the 9/10 December 1996, the proposal to amend the Sweeteners Directive (94/35/EC) was finally adopted unamended {See earlier item on Common Position, <a href="l-eu-96a.htm#96-11">27 June 1996</a>).
<p>
The amending directive adds further foods to those which may contain specified sweeteners.  It also makes a number of technical changes: adding a definition of "quantum satis"; introducing an Article relating to compound foods; and, amending the category "vitamin and dietary preparations to "Food supplements/diet integrators based on vitamins and/or mineral elements, syrup-type or chewable".
<p>
The Directive must be implemented within 12 months of its adoption and products not conforming must be prohibited within 18 months (except that those already marked or labelled may be sold until stocks are exhausted).

<h4>Commission Statement on BSE and Food Safety Reforms</h4>

An independent agency is needed to monitor the implementation of EU food safety and health measures, Commission President Jacques Santer stressed yesterday. The Commission had proposed the creation of such an agency in May 1996, he told the European Parliament's committee of inquiry on BSE, and if the proposal continued to make little progress in the Council, the Commission would bring the existing office responsible for inspections from Directorate General VI (agriculture) to DG XXIV (consumer policy). The scientific committees should also be strengthened, perhaps also  oving to DG XXIV, Santer said, to separate more clearly their role of providing the best scientific advice from the development of legislation by the Commission. 
<p>
<hr>
<a name="97-2"></a><i>MAFF Press Release, 16 January 1997</i>
 
<h4>Final Agreement Reached on EC Novel Foods Regulation</h4>
 
Food Minister Angela Browning welcomed the final agreement of the EC  novel foods regulation by the Council of Ministers and the European  Parliament [See <a href="#96-38">previous item</a>].  The regulation provides for a statutory pre-market safety assessment  based on the approach that the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and  Processes already follows.
<p>
The regulation will lead to special labelling when a novel food is  judged, on the basis of a scientific assessment, not to be equivalent to an existing food.  Foods will also require labelling if there are  any special ethical concerns or if it contains a live genetically  modified organism.
<p>
Speaking in London today Mrs Browning said:<br>
"<i>This Regulation is a very good result for UK consumers and industry. It provides the safeguards that consumers expect and deserve while at the same time providing a climate of greater certainty for industry.  The Regulation contains extensive labelling provisions, which most  importantly from the consumers points of view, are enforceable. I look forward to the early implementation of this regulation and I  am confident that the UK will continue to have an influential role in the safety assessment of novel foods</i>".
<p>
The Regulation is finalised and will come into force 90 days after publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.  This is expected to be in the first half of 1997.

<h4>Regulation for Nitrate in Lettuce and Spinach</h4>

The Commission proposal to set limits for nitrate in lettuce and spinach was considered at the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs on December 1996.  The proposal was agreed by a majority decision and the resulting Regulation will apply from 15 February 1997.
<p>
The letter indicates that, whilst maintaining its long-standing opposition to the principle of this legislation, the UK voted in favour of the Regulation as it now represents the best compromise achievable that safeguards the interests of both our growers and consumers.  The Regulation includes provision for a derogation which exempts crops grown for domestic consumption for a transitional period, provided that growers follow Good Agricultural Practice.  It is noted that the UK intends to apply this derogation for lettuce and fresh spinach.
<p>
The nitrate limits included in the Regulation are:
<ul>
<li>3,500 mg/kg for lettuce harvested in summer;
<li>4,500 mg/kg for lettuce harvested in winter;
<li>2,500 mg/kg for outdoor grown lettuce (May to August)
<li>2,500 mg/kg for spinach harvested in summer
<li>3,000 mg/kg for spinach harvested in winter
<li>2,000 mg/kg for preserved or frozen spinach
</ul>
<p>
It is indicated that recent concerns raised by the UK that some domestically produced(summer) spinach and imports from other EU countries in the winter would have difficulty in meeting the limits received no support from the other Member States.  The UK will continue to press for this issue to be resolved at the earliest opportunity (probably when the limits are reviewed in 1998)

<h4>Adoption of Decision on National Laws Prohibiting Food Additives in Certain Foodstuffs</h4>

As previously described (see <a href="l-eu-96b.htm#96-20">11 July 1996</a>), the Community has been developing a Decision which would permit the maintenance of national laws prohibiting additives in certain foods.  The Common Position was adopted on the 18 June 1996.  It was formally adopted at the Environment Council held on the 9/10 December.
<p>
No changes to the Common Position text were proposed  by the European Parliament during its second reading of the proposal.  The text of the adopted Decision therefore contains a list of 15 traditional foods (as listed in item of <a href="l-eu-96b.htm#96-20">11 July 1996</a>) for which certain Member States may maintain national bans on specific additive use on their territory.  None are UK products.

<h4>Genetically Modified Maize</h4>

The following is an extract from The Week in Europe.  No other details are yet available to me (but see earlier item <a href="#96-36">14 November 1996</a>).
<p>
<i>"The Commission has decided to authorize the placing on the market of genetically modified maize, notified by Ciba-Geigy.  This follows extensive consideration by the Council and Commission, and reports by three scientific panels; the scientific basis for the decision is far better than a few months ago, Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said."</i>

<i>MAFF Letter, 19 December 1996</i>

<h4>Amendment to Directive 89/398 on Foods for Particular Nutritional Uses</h4>

Discussions on an amendment to Directive 89/398 on foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses have been underway for some time.  A proposal was published in December 1994 and a Common Position was reached in June 1996.  The proposal was adopted at the Environment Council on 8/9 December.  The Directive reference number is not yet known.
<p>
The only amendment relates to the temporary placing on the market of products not complying with the legal requirements.  The following paragraph is added to the Directive (in Article 4):
<p>
<i>"To enable foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses and resulting from scientific and technological progress to be placed on the market rapidly, the Commission may, after consulting the Scientific Committee for Food and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13, authorize for a two-year period the placing on the market of foodstuffs which does not comply with the rules as to composition laid down by the specific directives referred to in Annex 1.
<p>
"If necessary, the Commission may add in the authorization decision labelling rules relating to the change in composition."</i>

<h4>Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin</h4>

It is understood that at a Regulatory meeting of Member States on the 11 December 1996, the third draft list of names was approved.  The only additional item for the UK which was on the list was "Whitstable Oysters" which is granted a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI).  [For more informations see <a href="#96-37">14 November 1996</a>]
<p>
A 4th list is currently being prepared for discussion in early February.

<a name="96-41"></a><i>MAFF Letter 17 December 1996</i>

<h4>Natural Mineral Waters</h4>

The Directive amending Council Directive 80/777 on Natural Mineral Waters (adopted 23 July 1996) has been published in the Official Journal as Directive 96/70.  It can be found in OJ L299, 23.11.96, p 26-28.  The Directive entered into force on 13 December 1996.  Member States have until 28 October 1998 to prohibit trade in products not complying with the Directive.
<p>
The Commission has now commenced work on a Commission Directive laying down detailed rules in connection with 96/70.  It is intended that this will concentrate on four items (from amended Article 11.1 or 80.777): limits for levels of constituents, labelling of high levels of constituents, conditions of use of ozone-enriched air and labelling of treatments.  Other matters, such as methods of analysis and sampling procedures will be dealt with in a subsequent directive.
<p>
The discussion on the use of ozone-enriched air follows an opinion given by the Scientific Committee for Food which suggests that usage should be restricted to carbonated waters with a pH saturation value below 7.2, in closed systems, for a certain duration.

<h4>Miscellaneous Additives Amendment</h4>

As previously noted [see <a href="l-eu-96b.htm#96-14">2 July 1996</a>], a Common Position for an amendment to Directive 95/2 was adopted on the 25 June 1996.  The amending Directive was formally adopted at the Environment Council on 9/10 December.  It provides for the addition to Annex I of "E407a Processed Eucheuma Seaweed" at quantum satis (good manufacturing practice level).  The text will be published in the Official Journal in due course.
<p>
The amendment has to be implemented by Member States - probably by 25 September 1997 (although the version circulated by MAFF states "1996").

<h4>Progress on Novel Food Regulation</h4>

A regulation on novel foods and food ingredients has been under development for several years.  However, although the Council of Ministers had reached agreement on the text (the Common Position), it was subject to a second reading in the European Parliament.  The Parliament proposed several changes which were not acceptable to the Council of Ministers.  In this situation a Conciliation Committee is established between the 2 Institutions to reach agreement.  Agreement has now been reached.
<p>
The major outstanding issue related to labelling.  The section dealing with labelling is Article 8 which now reads as follows:
<p>
<i>1. Without prejudice to other requirements of the Community law concerning the labelling o foodstuffs, the following additional specific labelling requirements shall apply to foodstuffs in order to ensure that the final consumer is informed of:<br>
(a) any characteristic or food property such as:<br>
- composition<br>
- nutritional value or nutritional effects<br>
- intended use of the food<br>
which renders a novel food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.<br>
(b) the presence in the noel food or food ingredient of material which is not present in an existing equivalent food stuff, and which may have implications for the health of certain sections of the population;<br>
(c) the presence in the novel food or food ingredient of material which is not present in an existing equivalent foodstuff, and which may give rise to ethical concerns;<br>
(d) the presence of an organism genetically modified by techniques of genetic modification, the non-exhaustive list of which is laid down in Annex IA, Part I of Directive 90/220/EEC
<p>
2.  In the absence of an existing equivalent food or food ingredient, appropriate provisions shall be adopted where necessary in order to ensure that consumers are adequately informed of the nature of the food or food ingredient.
<p>
3.  Any detailed rules for implementing this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13</i> [the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs procedure].
<p>
Additional changes include:
<ul>
<li>a provision which requires that those substances exempted from the controls (food additives controlled by Directive 89/107, flavourings controlled by Directive 88/338 and extraction solvents controlled by Directive 88/344) by Article 2 are exempted only so long as the safety levels laid down in the Directives corresponds to the safety level of this Regulation.
<li>a provision which requires the Commission, in addition to a review in 5 years, to monitor the application of the Regulation and its impact on health, consumer protection, consumer information and the functioning of the internal market and, if necessary, to bring forward proposals 
<li>the addition of a Commission statement which states that:  "The Commission confirms that should it appear, in the light of experience that there are gaps in the system of protection of public health provided for by the existing legal framework, in particular in respect of processing aids, it will formulate appropriate proposals in order to fill those gaps."
</ul>
<p>
The text is now subject to formal adoption by the Council and the European Parliament.
<p>
<hr>
<a name="96-37"></a><i>Scottish Office Letter - 14 November 1996</i>

<h4>Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origins</h4>

Regulation 2081/92 provides for the registration of protected names and geographical origins for agricultural products and foodstuffs.  The Commission has previously circulated two lists under this Regulation which have been adopted (See earlier item on Origin Marking <a href="l-eu-96a.htm#96-17">12 June/1 July 1996</a>).  A further short list has now been received.
<p>
The new proposed registrations include:<br>
<ul>
<li>Germany - meat-based products (3), cheeses (3) and bakery product (1)
<li>Austria - cheese (1)
<li>Italy - olive oil (1)
<li>Greece - cherries (1), table olives (1), gums and resins (2) and essential oils (1)
<li>Finland - potato (1)
<li>United Kingdom - fish and fish products (1)
</ul>
<br>
The United Kingdom item relates to the protection of geographical indication for "Whitstable Oysters".
<p>
The letter invites comments on the listed names by early December.

<h4>Genetically Modified Maize. </h4>

The Commission has postponed a decision on authorisation for the placing on the market of genetically modified maize until three scientific committees have delivered their opinions. It now expects to deal with the issue in December, after it has received the opinions of the Scientific Committees on Food, on Animal Nutrition, and for Pesticides. Any decision needs to be taken on the best basis for assessing the effects on health and the environment, and to be widely acceptable, Commissioner Ritt Bjerregaard said.

<h4>Proposed EC Limits for Lead and Cadmium in Foodstuffs</h4>

Discussions on this issue have been progressing for some time.  The latest development was that the Commission circulated a revised draft in late September and a Commission Working Group was held in Brussels on 30 September and 1 October.
<p>
The latest draft includes a number of changes to previous drafts.  Infant foods, for instance are now excluded from the proposal and distinctions have been made between fish in general and those species with naturally higher lead and cadmium levels.
<p>
Comments made at the Working Group are to be considered by the Commission for incorporation into a revised draft of the proposal with any forthcoming comments received from Member States or from industry.  The next meeting of the Working Group is planned for early 1997, at which the revised text will be discussed.  The Commission has also announced its intention to have the revised text ready for presentation at the Standing Committee for Foodstuffs (StCF) following the Working Group meeting.  The StCF is the forum where agreement on this issue will be reached.

<h4>
Quantitative Ingredient Declaration</h4>

A "Common Position" on an amendment to the EC Food Labelling Directive had been adopted on the 15 June 1995.  This would introduce more specific rules relating to quantitative ingredient declarations (QUID).  The European Parliament subsequently proposed certain amendments which the Council were unwilling to accept.  The proposal therefore went to a Conciliation Committee.
<p>
The Committee eventually agreed to the necessary changes to the common position and these were formally agreed at a meeting of the Committee on 16 October 1996.
<p>
The agreed text was not available at the time the circulation of the MAFF letter.
<p>
It is expected that the proposal will now be formally adopted by the end of the year for implementation during 1997.

<h4>Labelling of Beef and Beef Products</h4>

The Commission has published proposals for two new Regulations to help restore confidence in beef and beef products following the difficulties arising from BSE.  The first covers the identification and registration of cattle and the second is on the labelling of beef and beef products.  Only summary details of the second are given here.
<p>
In addition to the requirements on labelling already existing, if an operator or organization wishes to label beef or beef products in a detailed manner at the point of sale, it must meet the requirements of the Regulation.

Each operator or organization shall submit a specification for approval to the competent authority of each Member State in which production or sale of the beef or beef products  in question takes place.  The specification shall indicate the information to be included on the label, the measures to be taken to ensure the accuracy of the information, the control system to be applied.  Any specification which does not ensure a link being made between identification of the carcase, quarter, pieces of meat and meat products and the individual animal, or in the case of pieces of meat and meat products the animals concerned, shall be refused.  Where a specification is approved, the operator or organization shall be entitled to label beef and beef products, provided that the label contains its name or logo.
<p>
Provision is made for approval in different Member States and for products from third countries.
<p>
Details are given as to the type of information which can be included on beef and beef products.  Detailed rules may be developed regarding this information.
<p>
The proposals are due for early discussion as a matter of urgency.

<h4>Food Additives for Use in Flavourings - Draft Directive</h4>

The Commission has published for comment a draft directive which would lay down those additives which may be used in flavourings.  It is very brief and specifies the following:
<ul>
<li>Only food additives mentioned in Directive 95/2 with the exception of those mentioned in the Annex may be used in flavourings
<li>Only colours mentioned in Part 1 of Annex V of Directive 94/36 may be used in flavourings sold to the end consumer.
<li>Without prejudice to the Directives 94/35. 94/36 and 95/2, food additives shall be used in accordance with good manufacturing practice, and at a level no higher than is necessary to achieve the intended purpose for storage and use of flavourings.
</ul>
<p>
The Annex lists the following additives, mentioned in Directive 95/2, as being not permitted for use in flavourings: E230, E231, E232, E233, E234, E235, E239, E242, E249, E250, E251, E252, E280, E281, E282, E283, E284, E285, E311, E312, E315, E316, E353, E476, E479b, E483, E520, E521, E522, E523, E535, E536, E538, E579, E620, E621, E622, E623, E624, E625, E626, E627, E628, E629, E630, E631, E632, E633, E634, E635, E912, E914, E927, E950, E957, E1105.
<p>
Discussion is expected to start in late November with adoption planned for spring 1997.
