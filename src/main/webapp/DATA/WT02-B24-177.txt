<H4><CENTER>A 40-minute video explaining the Hows and Whys of Surrogate
Parenting</CENTER><BR><CENTER>VHS Format<BR>US $17.00 plus shipping and

</H4><P>
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation, Inc. has long been
helping infertile couples create families since 1980, and with our assistance
hundreds of long awaited babies have been born to some very thankful parents.
&#160;The staff at the Center believes that educating people about surrogacy
is one of their most important responsibilities. &#160;However, many people
who are considering this option have difficulty envisioning the type of women
who become surrogate mothers. &#160;In addition, couples may also be curious
about other couples' experiences with surrogacy.
<P>In <B>Creating Your Family </B>you will meet seven surrogate mothers as
well as two couples whose children were born with the assistance of surrogate
mothers. &#160;They will answer questions that most couples have about surrogacy,
in addition to some questions that no one thinks to ask. &#160;You will be
guided through the surrogate parenting process that has been so grossly
misrepresented in the media. &#160;Most importantly, you will be introduced
to the human factor of this process that is so often clouded with statistics
and legalese.

<UL><LI>What motivates a woman to be a surrogate?<BR>
