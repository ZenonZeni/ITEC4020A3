<B>Prescribed Burn Program<BR>
FACT SHEET
</B>

</CENTER><P>

In the final report presented last fall, the review of Ontario's prescribed burn (PB) program made 17 recommendations to the Minister of Natural Resources. The implementation of these recommendations have been summarized into four sections:  Operations, Planning, Communications, and Future Development.<P>
 
<B>Operations:</B>  Ontario's PB program now recognizes "problematic control" as a potential fourth stage of prescribed burning.  This is defined as a condition when the prescribed burn (during any of its three stages of ignition, control or demobilization) is not developing as planned and the fire could potentially escape or consume more resources and funds than was planned.<P>

Specific criteria have been developed to invoke more aggressive action to extinguish the burn once this declaration has been made.<P>
 
<B>Planning:</B>  A complete review of the Prescribed Burn planning manual this past winter has resulted in the preparation of a revised interim manual.  This will be replaced in June by a final version which incorporates the recommendations of the review committee.<P>
 
New planning initiatives cover: criteria to be used in the planning process that will direct more aggressive control and management; planned contingencies for fires that go beyond prescribed boundaries, and which also may have environmental impacts;  specific directions for communicating with communities in close proximity to burn projects.<P>

<B>Communications:</B>  A more structured approach to communications both internally and externally has been developed.  The communications section of the PB planning manual has been greatly expanded, and places greater emphasis on communications after ignition and during problematic control.<P>

<B>Future Development:</B>  The PB program has upgraded internal weather forecasts through a new agreement with Atmospheric Environment Services, which also includes enhanced long-term forecasting and application.  MNR's Fire Science and Technology Unit is also evaluating new developments in the field of infrared scanning technology, and their application to fire operations.
