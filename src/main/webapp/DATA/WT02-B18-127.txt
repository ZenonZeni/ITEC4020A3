<h4>December 16, 1996</h4>
<h2>Article 8.4.C and E</h2>
<h1>Penalty Overtime Exclusion Period </h1>
<p>In accordance with provisions of the National Agreement,
penalty overtime rates are not paid during the month of December.
It has been the practice to designate four consecutive work weeks
(which might include some days in November) as the December
penalty overtime exclusion period. For December 1996, the
American Postal Workers Union and the US Postal Service agreed
that the exclusion begins November 30, 1996 (start of week two of
pay period 25-96) and ends December 27, 1996 (end of week one of
pay period 01-97). </p>
<p>Note: The November 7, 1996 <em>Postal Bulletin</em> reported
the wrong dates. Management will make the necessary correction. </p>
<h1>Cost-of-Living Adjustments</h1>
<p><strong>The CPI-W rose in November to 464.2. After the fourth
month of the third cost-of-living adjustment period under the
1994 National Agreement, postal workers have accrued:</strong></p>
<p align="center">Per Annum: $ 239.20 </p>
<p align="center">Per Pay Period: $ 9.20 </p>
<p align="center">Cents Per Hour: 11.50&#162;</p>
<p>The next COLA will be effective March 1, 1997 and will be
reflected in checks dated March 21, 1997 (PP 06-97). </p>
<p>Employees are receiving $520 per annum as a result of the
first two COLA increases.</p>
<p><strong>CSRS COLA </strong></p>
<p>The 1997 CSRS retiree COLA is based on the third quarter
(July, August, September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the
1995 third quarter average. The 1997 CSRS cost-of-living
adjustment will be 2.9% and will be reflected in January 1997
annuity checks. </p>
<p>The 1995 CSRS COLA was 2.8%. The 1996 CSRS COLA was 2.6% and
reflected in April, 1996 annuity checks. </p>
<p><strong>FERS COLA </strong></p>
<p>The 1997 FERS retiree COLA is based on the third quarter
(July, August, September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the
1995 third quarter average. However, if the CPI-W quarterly
average increases 3% or more, one percentage point is subtracted.
A 5% increase in the quarterly CPI-W average results in a 4%
adjustment. If the quarterly average increases from 2% to 3%,
benefits will increase by 2%. If the CPI-W quarterly average
increases 2% or less, benefits will increase by the CPI-W
quarterly average increase. The 1997 FERS cost-of-living
adjustment will be 2.0% and will be reflected in January 1997
annuity checks. </p>
<p>The 1995 FERS COLA was 2.0%. The 1996 FERS COLA was 2.0% and
reflected in April, 1996 annuity checks. </p>
<p><strong>Social Security </strong></p>
<p>The 1997 Social Security COLA is based on the third quarter
(July, August, September) average CPI-W index in 1996 over the
1995 third quarter average. The 1997 SSI cost-of-living
adjustment will be 2.9% and will be reflected in January 1997
annuity checks. </p>
<p>The 1995 Social Security COLA was 2.8%. The 1996 Social
Security COLA was 2.6%. </p>
<p><strong>FECA COLA </strong></p>
<p>COLA increases for FECA recipients are based on the percentage
increase in the December index from year to year. After the
eleventh month of the 1997 adjustment period the CPI-W index has
risen 3.3%. </p>
<p>The 1995 FECA COLA was 2.7%. The 1996 FECA COLA was 2.5% and
reflected in March, 1996 benefit checks. </p>
<h3><strong>Cost-of-Living Adjustments for Data Centers </strong></h3>

the third cost-of-living adjustment period under the 1995 Data
Centers Agreement, postal workers have accrued: </p>
<p align="center">Per Annum: $ 119.40 </p>
<p align="center">Per Pay Period: $ 4.60 </p>
