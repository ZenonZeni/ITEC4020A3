<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The Best Reasons to
Invest</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>The best reasons to invest may be the people in your
life</STRONG><BR>
Smart investing begins with people and a purpose.  Whether you live alone or with
others,
have young
children or aging parents, chances are you want your investments to enhance
someone's
life.  Knowing
who you're investing for, what you hope to achieve, and when you'll need your money
can
help you
develop an effective investment strategy.  If you're young and single, you may make
different
choices
from someone who's married and about to retire.  If you want to pay for your
children's
education, are
you thinking about public colleges or aiming for the Ivy League?
<P>

<STRONG>Set specific goals</STRONG><BR>
Most people want more money.  But if you're setting an investment goal, it helps to
be more
specific. 
Do you want to retire with a million dollars in 25 years?  Are you hoping to make a
down
payment on a
$100,000 house in five years?  Would you like to earn at least three percent more
than the
inflation rate
over the next ten years? 
<P>
	Specific goals make it easier to see if your investments are on course - and
easier to
adjust them if
they start to fall behind.  It's fine to want financial independence.  But
translating that into a
specific
dollar amount and a definite time frame can help you decide what's realistic and
what's just
a dream.
<P>

<STRONG>Know when you need results</STRONG><BR>
Most people have a variety of goals with different time horizons.  You may want to
buy a new
car next
year, start your own business in five years, put your kids through college in ten
years, and
take a world
cruise when you retire. 
<P>
	Knowing when you'll need your money can help you choose the right investments. 
A
money
market
fund may be an appropriate investment for a car you'll buy next spring.  A bond or
growth and income fund might be a good choice for an intermediate-term goal.  And
equity funds may be
more
appropriate
for your longer-term needs. 
<P>

<STRONG>Consider how you feel about risk</STRONG><BR>
Investments go up and down, some more than others.  While past performance is no
guarantee of
future results, over time, stocks have tended to have wider price fluctuations than
bonds. 
Bonds, in
turn, have tended to vary more than short-term investments like Treasury bills or
money
market
instruments. 
<P>
	Of course, price variations aren't all you'll want to consider.  Over time,
stocks have
tended to
provide
higher returns than bonds, and bonds have typically returned more than money market
instruments. 
Smart investors know that risk and return are closely linked.  So they may seek the
highest
return
potential they can get without taking on risks they can't afford.

<P>
<STRONG>Balancing Risk and Return</STRONG>
<BR>


The kinds of investments that are right for you will depend largely on how you feel
about risk
and
reward. While most people want low risk and high returns, that combination may be
difficult
to find. 
<P>
As you can see from this chart, over time, common stocks have substantially
outperformed
long-term
government bonds, Treasury bills, and outpaced inflation. The chart also shows that
over
short periods,
stocks have had more ups and downs than fixed income securities, subjecting
investors to
greater risk.
While bonds and Treasury bills tend to provide relatively stable income, their
returns also
may vary with
changes in interest rates. As a general rule, investments with higher return
potential tend to
involve
more risk, and low-risk investments tend to provide lower returns. However, past
performance is no
guarantee of future results.

Common stock
performance is measured by the S&P 500, an unmanaged index considered to be
generally
representative of the U.S. stock market. Long-term government bond performance is
measured by a
one-bond portfolio with a 20-year maturity and current coupon. U.S. Treasury bill
performance is based
on a one-bill portfolio with the shortest maturity not less than one month.
Inflation is
measured by the
Consumer Price Index (CPI), which shows the changes in the cost of selected goods.
