UK Employer Sanctions</h2>

<ul>


<p>

The UK's Home Affairs ministry mailed letters to 1.1 million British

employers in early December informing them that the employer sanctions included

in the 1996/97 Asylum and Immigration Act go into effect January 27, 1997.

Employers found to have hired illegal alien workers over 16 can be fined up to

L5000.  The government estimates employer compliance costs at L0.68 or about $1

per employee.<p>

An employer can escape employer sanctions if the employer can prove that he

saw and kept a copy of documentation which seemed to relate to the job

applicant and appeared to him to prove they were entitled to work in the UK.

The government said that "We are not expecting employers to act as immigration

officers. We wouldn't expect an employer to detect a good forgery, for example.

That is our business."<p>

Industries most likely to be affected by the new employer sanctions law

include farming, clothing, construction and catering.<p>

Some 10,000 illegal workers were apprehended in the UK in 1996 compared

with 4,000 in 1988.  In 1995, illegal entry action was initiated against 10,381

people, up from 7480 in 1994.  However, two thirds of the illegal aliens

detected in 1995 applied for asylum to prevent their removal from the

UK.<p>

About 35 percent of the illegals in 1995 deceived an immigration officer at

entry and 31 percent were smuggled into the UK.<p>

According to British press reports, "hundreds" of East Europeans are paying

L150 to register with agencies in Eastern Europe for "no documentation

required" jobs in the UK.  Typically young people pay another L750 for tourist

or student visas and then arrive in the UK to work long hours on farms and in

factories for L2 per hour, or about L80 to L100 per week.  While working, they

must pay up to half their earnings for transportation and

accommodations.<p>

The British company that the workers thought they were working for asserted

that it had only rented housing and vans to subcontractors who were the actual

employers.<p>

"Illegal migrant suspects up 40 percent," Press Association

Newsfile, December 29, 1996. "Discrimination fear over illegal workers' curbs,"

Press Association Newsfile, December 3, 1996.  Jo Knowsley, "Foreigners duped

and paid slave wages," Sunday Telegraph, October 20, 1996.<p>
