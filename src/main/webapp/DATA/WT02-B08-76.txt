<B>We are delighted to extend a personal invitation to attend the XXth Congress
of the Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum (C.I.N.P.) in
Melbourne, June 23 - 27, 1996.<BR>
<BR>
The local organising committee and the International Scientific Programme
Committee have put together an exciting programme, developing the theme
&quot;The Decade of the Brain&quot;. The Scientific Programme has a comprehensive,
innovative series of symposia and poster presentations already enthusiastically
supported by offers from many participants.<BR>
<BR>
Our host city, Melbourne, is a cosmopolitan dynamic venue in the booming
Asia-Pacific region, recently voted &quot;The Worlds Most Livable City&quot;.
It is renowned for its restaurants, sporting and cultural activities and
is known internationally for its tree-lined boulevards, its magnificent
Victorian architecture, and its love of fine foods, wines and the arts.
We have programmed a comprehensive range of social and other activities
to enable you to sample our country's and city's natural beauty and host
of attractions.<BR>
<BR>
We recommend that you take advantage of the occasion to extend your stay,
to visit other wonders of Australia. Your choice is limited only by your
imagination: beautiful beaches and the spectacular coral of the Barrier
Reef; the sunburnt beauty and mystery of central Australia and Ayres Rock;
the unique flora and fauna of the rain forests of the tropics, national
parks and mountains.<BR>
<BR>
Come join us for a wonderful congress and experience the wonders of our
country. We look forward to meeting you in Melbourne.</B>
