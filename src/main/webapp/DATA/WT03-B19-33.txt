<strong>A trademark</strong> is a word, phrase, symbol, design, or 
any combination of these elements that is used by a business to identify
a source of a product and to distinguish it from the competition even
if the source is unknown. Trademarks symbolize the reputation of the
company and the quality of its products and services.<P>

<strong>A service mark</strong> is a word, phrase, symbol or design that is
used by a business to identify a service rather than a tangible item
and to distinguish it from services offered by the competition. For
this discussion, unless distinctions are made, "trademarks" refer to both
trademarks and service marks.<P>

<strong>Trade names</strong> are corporate or business names. They identify
the business, i.e., the provider of the product or service, rather than the
product or service itself. Trade names are the propoer nouns, so they
can be used in the possessive form and do not need to be followed by a
generic term.<P>

Because company names are frequently used both as trademarks and as trade
names, care must be taken to distinguish between the two uses and to 
follow the proper usage rules for each. Varian and Varian Associates, Inc.
are trade names which are also registered trademarks.<P>

<blockquote<em>EXAMPLES:</em></blockquote><P>
<blockquote><strong>Trade Name:</strong>
	The linear accelerator, made by Varian Associates, Inc.
	has become the market leader for radiation therapy.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Trade Name:</strong>
	Varian's latest enhancements for the accelerators became
	available last month.</blockquote><P>
<blockquote><strong>Trade Name:</strong>
	Varian is the world leader in vacuum system design for
	exceptional sputter processing.</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong>Trademark:</strong>
	Varian sputtering systems operate on production lines
	throughout the world.</blockquote><P>

The <strong>company logo</strong> is a symbol used with the company name for
company identity. Although it is not used as a trademark in literature, our
VA company logo is a registered trademark in countries throughout the
world. See the Corporate Identity guide for use of the company logo.<P>

<h4><font color="C50B21">Trademark Rights</FONT></h4>
<A NAME="trade">
Product names used internationally are subject to the trademark laws of
each country in which they are used. Although almost all countries have
laws for protecting trademarks, the laws may differ.<P>

In the United States, a company gains trademark rights by using a name with
a product or service, not by merely selecting a mark. Generally, the first
company to use a trademark with a certain kind of product gains priority
over late users of a similar trademark for similar products.<P>

A company can register its trademarks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, which provides certain legal advantages. Trademark and service 
mark registrations give the owner of the mark the right to prevent the
use of its marks by others in all states.<P>

Rights to a mark also can be lost if its use is discontinued. Nonuse 
of a mark with the intention of not resuming its use will result in
abandonment of the mark. Therefore, attempting to preserve a mark
by "banking" it and making periodic use of it will not succeed if it
appears that such use was not commercially significant and was made
solely to maintain ownership of a mark that is no longer intended 
for commercial use.<P>

Other countries give priority to the first to register a trademark
rather than the first to use a trademark. Each coun try has its 
own trademark registration procedure, so decisions to register a
trademark need to be made country by country, balancing the importance
of protecting the trademark against the expense of registration.<P>

In all countries, trademark rights can be lost if the name becomes
"generic", that is, if the name becomes the commonly accepted term
for the product, rahter than a distinctive term associating the
product with a particular brand or source of quality. For example,
the trademark Thermos was almost lost due to the public's generic use
of the term as a common descriptive adjective or noun to describe or
refer to vacuum insulated containers.<P>
