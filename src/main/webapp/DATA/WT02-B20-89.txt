What is Tourette Syndrome?<P>

Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by
tics -- involuntary, rapid, sudden movements or vocalizations that
occur repeatedly in the same way. Diagnostic criteria include:<P>

 <UL><li>Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics present at some
time, although not necessarily simultaneously;

 <li>The occurrence of tics many times a day (usually in bouts) nearly
 every day or intermittently throughout the span of more than one
 year;
  
<li>Periodic changes in the number, frequency, type and location of
 the tics, and in the waxing and waning of their severity. Symptoms
 can sometimes disappear for weeks or months at a time;

<li>Onset before the age of 18.</ul><P>

  Twenty-one children (ages 6-15) with Tourette's syndrome completed an 
educational battery.  Seventy-five percent had problems with spelling and 
writing, 50% had difficulty with calculations, and 25% had difficulty with word 
identification and reading comprehension.  Visual-motor defects were common.

  Three fact sheets provide parents and educators with basic information on 
Tourette Syndrome (TS).  The first sheet is titled "Learning Problems and the TS 
Child" and is by Herman Davidovicz, a neuropsychologist.  It notes the high 
frequency of attention deficit disorders and learning problems in children with 
TS and provides information for parents on warning signs, reasons for the 
learning problems, suggestions for intervention, and consideration of remedial 
help and regular classroom adjustments.  The second fact sheet is by an 
educator, Susan Conners, and is titled "Specific Classroom Strategies and 
Techniques for Students with Tourette Syndrome." Strategies are suggested for 
the following areas: tic symptoms; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
problems; visual motor integration, auditory processing difficulties, and fine 
motor skill problems; and "short fuse" and oppositional behavior difficulties.  
The third sheet is by Jacqueline Favish, a special educator, and is titled 
"Techniques To Aid Students with TS in Completing Written Assignments." It 
offers suggestions for helping students with note taking, standardized tests, 
teacher-devised tests, and timed tests.  (DB)<BR>

  This parent and teacher guide considers discipline for children with 
Tourette Syndrome (TS) who have difficulty with behavioral compliance.  
Discipline is defined primarily as "training to act in accordance with rules," 
and is not punishment but involves teaching self-control and observance of 
societal expectations.  Controversy and misconceptions about discipline are 
noted.  Consideration is given to redirecting the child from undesirable 
behaviors which can occur with TS, such as the urge to spit or touch or grab 
other people's personal body parts.  Ways to redirect the child from obsessive 
thought repetition are also addressed to help avoid the child's distress when 
saying phrases or words of an obscene or violent nature which stick in their 
minds.  Practice in anticipating outcomes of behaviors can be helpful for the 
child with TS who has difficulty with impulse control and does not see the 
connection between actions and consequences.  In addition to teaching the child 
the concept of cause and effect, children can be taught how to make choices and 
to accept consequences for them.  Also important is providing the child with 
structure, direction, and limits regarding the expression of explosive anger.  
Included are brief annotations of three videotapes and three publications on TS.

  Tourette Syndrome (TS) is described as a genetically based, chronic 
constellation of neurobehavioral symptoms and associated features involving 
repetitive, simple, and/or complex motor and phonic tics.  Treatment generally 
involves neuroleptic medication.  Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
attention deficit hyperactive disorder, learning disabilities, 
neuropsychological anomalies, school adjustment problems, and behavior or 
conduct disorders are often associated with Tourette Syndrome.  Milestones 
unique to the course of Tourette Syndrome may include parents' realization that 
something is unusual about their child's behavior, a referral to a school 
psychologist, an official diagnosis, and subsequent parental involvement with a 
support group.  The role of the school psychologist involves evaluation, case 
manager, counselor or therapist, and advocacy.  School psychologists are in a 
unique position to be prime facilitators and advocates in promoting self-
esteem, encouraging school achievement, and supporting warm family 
relationships and peer socializations.  Appendices outline symptoms and 
frequency of behavioral difficulties.  (Contains 23 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  Designed as a resource for two-year college faculty and staff working with 
students with disabilities, this handbook contains facts about various 
disabilities, practical suggestions for improving services, and resource points 
for further information.  Following a brief introduction, legal implications 
regarding disabled students are discussed for postsecondary education 
institutions, and general suggestions for overcoming negative reactions to 
disabled students are provided.  Next, the handbook describes symptoms and 
useful teaching techniques/classroom approaches for the following disabilities: 
learning disabilities; traumatic brain injury; mobility impairments; visual 
impairments (legal blindness); total blindness; hearing impairments, including 
information on using a relay system to call the hearing impaired and working 
with interpreters; back impairments; speech impairments; epilepsy; cerebral 
palsy; carpal tunnel syndrome; multiple sclerosis; rheumatoid arthritis; 
Tourette's syndrome; mental illness; suicide; Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS); and substance abuse.  For each disability, telephone numbers 
of institutions offering further information are provided.  The manual then 
lists possible side effects of medication that students may be taking and 
reviews considerations regarding disabled student access to science 
laboratories.  Finally, evacuation procedures for visually impaired, hearing 
impaired, and non-ambulatory students are considered.  (MAB)<BR>

  Examination of 42 cases of children with Tourette Syndrome with intelligence 
quotients (IQs) above 70 found that mean IQs were higher than mean math, 
spelling, reading, and reading comprehension scores.  Using a 1.5 standard 
deviation discrepancy, 51 percent met criteria for learning disability in at 
least one academic area; 21 percent had a 2-standard-deviation discrepancy.
