<h1>How to Approach the Black Community </h1>

<p> <b>by Clifford A. Schaffer</b> </p>

<h2><img src="../graphics/blueline.gif" align="BOTTOM"> </h2>

<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p> There have been many people who have rightly criticized the
fact that the drug policy reform movement has not made major
allies in the black community - despite the fact that the black
community is clearly the most severely impacted by the drug war.
Instead, the reaction in the black community is often one of even
greater calls for law enforcement presence and even greater
support for the drug war. </p>

<p> While this is largely true, it is simply a matter that most
black people (like most white people) don't realize how we got to
where we are today with the drug problem. As soon as it is
explained in terms that are relevant and understandable to them,
they readily understand and agree with the need for reform -
specifically, not putting nearly so many people in prison. </p>

<p> I have always found it relatively easy to get black people,
particularly black leaders, to support drug policy reform. They
will not support &quot;legalization&quot;, but they will support
specific steps of reform which both they and the
&quot;legalizers&quot; agree are necessary. They already have a
problem with too many liquor stores in their communities, so they
will not support ideas which look like you are going to open up a
legal chain of crack houses. They can be expected to argue for
the point that we simply need to stop and look at what we are
doing, and seriously question the whole program. They will also
support and argue for constructive, rather than destructive
approaches to the problem. </p>

<p> Ultimately, many black leaders will tell you privately that
they support &quot;legalization&quot;, if they are just given the
facts as a basis for their view. However, they will still have a
significant problem with the public presentation. One church
leader told us that his church had once issued a health kit which
included various first aid items, educational materials, phone
numbers to call, a lot of other things, and a condom. He said
there was a storm of controversy about nothing but the condom and
they eventually had to take it out of the package because they
were spending all their time explaining it and defending it to
people, so they couldn't get anything else done. They ultimately
figured that it would be better to distribute the same package
with everything but the condom. It is sad, but it is a functional
reality of the community they live in. It is one task to persuade
them of the need for reform. It is another task to help them find
ways that they can address the issue with their own community. </p>

<h2>How to Find Them, Approach Them, and Win Them Over </h2>

<ol>
    <li>Do your homework. Be up to date on the latest stats,
        issues, and arguments as they relate to the black
        community. </li>
    <li>Look in the phone book for any churches or other social
        organizations located in, or allied to, the black
        community. </li>
    <li>Call the head of the organization and arrange an
        appointment. Most of them, particularly churches, will
        give you one if you just ask. </li>
    <li>Be prepared with charts, graphs, statistics, historical
        information, and reference sources, so you have an
        interesting and persuasive presentation. </li>
    <li>Cover the racial origins of the laws, with appropriate
        citations and quotes. </li>
    <li>Cover the current situation with black men, <u>including
        the lifetime risk of prison for black men</u> - and how
        the probability of a drug conviction relates to that
        total risk. </li>
    <li>Don't expect them to trust white people. After the last
        200 years, they are justified in being a little
        suspicious at times. Ask them to trust themselves and
        check everything you say. Then give them the reference
        sources to do it. </li>
    <li>Don't use the &quot;L&quot; word, the &quot;D&quot; word,
        or the &quot;M&quot; word. Use the &quot;R&quot; word -
        Reform - in terms that are specific to the concerns of
        the black community. Talk about constructive (treatment
        and education) rather than destructive (prison)
        approaches to the drug problem. </li>
    <li>They know that you (like most of those goody-good white
        people who come down to meddle in their community) are
        going to be gone tomorrow and not living with the
        consequences of whatever takes place in their community.
        Your arguments must, at all times, be expressed in terms
        which are meaningful and relevant to them. </li>
    <li>Understand their position. They CANNOT be seen as
        promoting or condoning drug use in any way at all. If you
        tell them you support the right of everyone to get
        loaded, you will find yourself in the parking lot in a
        matter of seconds. </li>
    <li>Remember that the Christian belief is very strong in the
        black community (though they do tend to have a somewhat
        more vigorous approach to their religion than those
        stuffy white people). The argument about what Jesus would
        do - build bigger prisons, or build hospitals and schools
        - will strike a resonant chord with many of them.
        Contrast love, compassion, and healing, with punishment,
        prison, and destruction. </li>
    <li>Help them to find a way to talk about it publicly. The
        issue of the disparity in the sentencing, and the sheer
        numbers of black men going to prison alone means that we
        should <b>AT LEAST </b>back up and take an honest look at
        what we are doing in the drug war. We must build, not
        destroy. And we must examine the entire drug war, not
        just the crack laws. </li>
    <li>Get them involved in our alliance. Get them connected to
        the Internet, if possible, (usually not possible), or get
        them on the mailing lists of the relevant organizations.
        Find someone from their group who will take the
        initiative in maintaining and responding to
        communications. </li>
    <li>Tell them about the online library and the fact that it
        has large amounts of information about the racial roots
        of the drug war, as well as other information. </li>
</ol>

<h2>Questions </h2>

<p> I have listed below, a number of the common questions which
will come up in such an interview, whether they are explicitly
stated or not. </p>

<h3>What is their biggest concern? </h3>

<p> Their biggest single concern at this point is the ongoing
massive destruction of black men. Black men are being rendered
&quot;economically dead&quot; by the massive imposition of prison
sentences. Their point of view may be somewhat skewed, in that
they may view this as a result of the drugs, not the laws, and it
may not have occurred to them that, as bad as drugs are, criminal
punishment is not the way to address the problem. </p>

<h3>Why did this white boy come all the way over here to tell
this to me? </h3>

<p> Because I am concerned about the drug war for my own reasons,
and I have the good sense to recognize that there are other
people who would also have concerns, for their own reasons. We
will both achieve better results if we work together toward
common goals. And, just as a matter of common sense and common
decency, I think it is pretty stupid to lock up half of all the
black men in America. There has to be a better way. </p>

<h3>Why should I trust you? </h3>

<p> Don't trust me. Trust yourself. I will simply give you a
point of view and the evidence which I think firmly supports it.
I think the evidence will shock you, but I don't ask you to
believe it. I will give you the reference sources where I got it,
and I encourage you to do your own research and let me know of
any facts or issues that I have missed. My strongest allies have
always come from the people who went to the library and verified
what I said. </p>

<h3>Why should black people support drug policy reform? </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Because the drug problem is tearing up the black
        community and we need to find a better approach -
        whatever it may be. </li>
    <li>Because the drug laws were based on racism from their
        inception, so there is no reason to expect them to be
        balanced and productive laws today. </li>
    <li>Because every major study of drug policy said that this
        policy only caused more harm than good, particularly for
        poor communities. </li>
    <li>Because it is what Jesus would do. </li>
    <li>Because we want to rebuild black men and make them
        productive citizens, not destroy them. </li>
</ol>

<h3>Are you asking me to support legalization? </h3>

<p> Not at all. I am asking you to recognize the simple
proposition that prison has become a bigger threat to black men
than the drugs themselves. Black men can, and do, recover from
drug problems and go on to live productive lives. They have a
much harder time recovering from a long stretch in prison. We
need to discourage drug use but we do not need to destroy their
lives in order to save them. </p>

<h3>But some of these guys are dangerous and need to be locked
up! </h3>

<p> I fully admit that there are a good number of black men out
there who are dangerous and should be locked up for the good of
society. But we have now reached the point where about half of
all the young black men in America will have spent at least one
stretch in prison before they are thirty. I find it hard to
believe that we have to lock up half of all the young black men
in America for the good of society. Whenever the numbers get that
large, we must stop and ask ourselves if this is really the best
course of action. </p>

<h3>Don't we need some jails? </h3>

<p> Certainly we do. But we learned long ago that, as bad as
alcohol is, Prohibition only caused more problems than it solved.
In the current situation, we can use our money to put one more
black man in prison, or we can use the same amount of money to
provide education or treatment to more than one hundred black
men. Suppose that someone gave us the decision on where we should
spend the next million dollars of tax money on this problem -
what should we do? Should we provide education and treatment for
up to two hundred people, or should we put two more drug dealers
in jail? </p>

<h3>How can I speak about this publicly? </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Talk about the terrible damage being done by not only the
        crack laws, but the drug laws in general. The crack laws
        are the worst example, but they are only one small part
        of a bigger system that is severely impacting black men. </li>
    <li>Talk about the need for education and treatment, not
        prison. Talk about the need for responses to the problem
        which build people rather than destroy them. </li>
    <li>Talk about the racial roots of the drug laws - how these
        laws were built on racism from their very inception, and
        how the image of the Negro Cocaine Fiend in 1914 is
        repeated in the image of the crack-fiend today. </li>
    <li>Talk about the need for an open and honest investigation
        of this entire drug problem - not just the mandatory
        minimums for crack. It is the entire drug policy which is
        wrong and it is the entire drug policy which must be
        fairly, openly, and honestly investigated. </li>
</ol>
