Apraxia (dyspraxia) refers to a disorder of the nervous system, characterized by an 
inability to carry out purposeful movements, but not accompanied by a loss of 
sensory function or paralysis.  An individual may have severe difficulty in performing drawing, writing, buttoning, and other tasks requiring fine motor skill, or in sequencing the necessary movements.<P>

  Target Audience: Researchers<BR>
  The phonological competence of 4 children, ages 5-7 years old, with a 
diagnosis of developmental apraxia of speech (DAS), was contrasted to that of 4 
normal children.  The DAS children revealed a severe deficit in rhyming ability.
Results suggest that DAS is a fundamental disorder of the segmental 
phonological level of language.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  A 7-year-old girl who exhibited characteristics consistent with developmental 
apraxia of speech, including excessive nasal resonance and nasal emission of 
air resulting from velopharyngeal port dysfunction, was fitted with a palatal 
lift prosthesis and followed for 11 years.  Results of use of the lift and 
speech/language remedial programing are presented.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  A case study is presented of a fourth-grade girl with a seemingly mild "r" 
articulation problem.  During remediation, it was determined that the girl also 
presented characteristics consistent with developmental apraxia of speech.  A 
 motor-programing remedial model was initiated; following five semesters of 
remediation, acceptable performance levels were attained.  (JDD)<BR>

  A treatment program is described which successfully improved the speech of a 
57-year-old apraxic patient.  The program was composed of physiologic 
(nonspeech) and phonetic (articulatory) tasks that began with oroneuromotor 
control activities and progressed to consonant-vowel syllable, word, and 
sentence drills, with all activities paced by a metronome.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  The paper describes the development of Signed Target Phoneme (STP) Therapy, 
using the hand shapes of the Americal Manual Alphabet to cue phonemes.  Adding 
STP to traditional therapy methods with a five-year-old boy diagnosed as having 
developmental apraxia of speech revealed a positive relationship between 
application of STP procedures and a more rapid acquisition of target phonemes.

  Analysis of spontaneous language samples of eight children (4-11 years old) 
diagnosed with developmental verbal apraxia (motor speech disorder) revealed 
that at least some of the errors could not be attributed to motor speech and/or 
phonologic limitations but rather indicated concomitant syntactic disorders.

  Five children, aged 7-10 years, exhibiting Developmental Verbal Apraxia (DVA) 
were evaluated to determine the presence of word-retrieval problems.  DVA is a 
symptom cluster including at least some of 21 potential symptoms, such as 
delayed speech development and severe articulation disorder.  The Boston Naming 
Test (a picture confrontation naming task) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary 
Test-Revised, Form L, were administered to all subjects.  Evidence of word-
finding problems was based on the number of correct responses, the speed with 
which responses were given, and other word-finding behaviors.  Results 
indicated that the DVA children had more restricted receptive vocabularies, 
expressively identified fewer pictures correctly upon confrontation,  identified 
the pictures more slowly than did normal children of the same age, and 
exhibited more behaviors often associated with word-finding problems (such as 
fidgeting and hitting their heads).  A year later, two of the DVA children were 
administered the new German's Test of Word Finding, which confirmed the 
continuing presence of word-finding problems.  It was concluded that children 
exhibiting DVA are thus at high risk to exhibit significant word-retrieval 
problems, and remedial objectives addressing these problems should be included 
in treatment programs of DVA clients so identified.  Appended are tables 
detailing the research results.  (JDD)<BR>
