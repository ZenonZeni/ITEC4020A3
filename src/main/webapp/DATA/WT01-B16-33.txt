<html><body><h4>2.   SCOPE
<p>
2.1  STRUCTURE OF WORK SCOPE AND PHASING</h4>
<p>
The RSA work scope is structured to represent the logical and chronological occurrence of the
distinct work activities.  The work segments are called phases, and include:  Phase A -
Development of Servicing Plans, Phase B -  Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization,
and Phase C - SNF Acceptance and Transport.  The purpose of the nine month Phase A Planning
work scope is to obtain comprehensive plans and revised pricing for the work scope defined in
both Phase B and Phase C from each contractor awarded a Phase A Regional Servicing Contract. 
For an RSA selected to participate in Phase B and Phase C,  the initial three year work scope
involves the total effort of marshaling the required hardware items, software, facilities and
personnel and preparing to startup waste acceptance and transportation operations plus the
following five years of management and acquisition of required hardware.  Phase C, commencing
about three years after start of Phase B,  is the five years of waste acceptance and transportation
operations.
<p>
<h4>2.2  PHASE A:  DEVELOPMENT OF SERVICING PLANS</h4>
<p>
During Phase A, the RSA shall contact each Purchaser with an allocation within its  region and
develop Purchaser approved Purchaser Site Service Plans; prepare an integrated Regional
Servicing Plan; determine required quantities of transportation and storage components;
determine software, personnel, services, and facilities requirements; prepare a management plan
for Phase B and Phase C work scope; and prepare revised pricing for Phase B and Phase C work
scope based on the plans and requirements estimates.  The Phase A plans, requirements
development, and revised pricing shall be based on the Regional Waste Acceptance Schedule
<a href="appb.htm">(Appendix B)</a>.  This is the starting point from which the RSA shall initiate discussions and
planning with the Purchasers in its region.  The RSA shall deliver the specified quantities of
Purchasers' SNF from the region to the Federal Facility.
<p>
The RSA may propose in its Purchaser Site Service Plans and Regional Servicing Plan any
reasonable approaches agreeable to the affected Purchasers.  However, OCRWM will not fund
any on-site infrastructure modifications or improvements to the Purchasers' facilities. 
<p>
<h4>2.3  PHASE B:  ACQUISITION OF HARDWARE ITEMS AND MOBILIZATION </h4>
<p>
Phase B is anticipated to last approximately eight years; the first three years of this phase will
cover pre-operational activities and hardware  acquisition, and the last five years will cover
management, and continuing transportation cask and storage system hardware acquisition needed
to support the SNF delivery rates during the Phase C waste acceptance and transportation
operations. 
<p>
OCRWM will only accept delivery and take title to SNF canisters, storage modules, and that
ancillary equipment required for handling of casks and canisters and support of Federal Facility
operations.  The RSA shall acquire all other hardware items either through lease or purchase; title
to these items shall remain with the RSA or the lessors. 
<p>
The pre-operational activities shall include acquisition of those dual-purpose systems and related
hardware items needed for startup; provision of a startup supply of storage modules for the
Federal Facility; utility interface activities; coordination with the Federal Facility Operator and
other RSAs; refinement of Purchaser Site Service Plans and the Regional Servicing Plan;
establishment of an operating capability for waste acceptance and transportation; preparation of
procedures and training materials; staffing and training of personnel; performance of institutional
and outreach activities with the Public to include local, State and Tribal groups; establishment of
services capabilities; selection of routes; and other pre-operational activities necessary to support
SNF acceptance and transport.
<p>
Prior to commencement of Phase C operations, the RSA shall provide dual-purpose systems
and/or canisters in quantities needed for startup operations to those Purchasers in its region in
accordance with the Regional Servicing Plan.   
<p>
Prior to initiation of SNF shipments at the commencement of Phase C operations and consistent
with the Regional Servicing Plan, the RSA shall provide NRC approved storage modules suitable
for use at the NRC-licensed Federal Facility for canistered SNF as Phase B deliverables.  All
required cask-related lifting hardware items, ancillary equipment, and transporters, if required,
are the responsibility of the RSA and must be supplied to the Federal Facility Operator prior to
commencement of SNF delivery. 
<p>
The overall management function of the RSA in  the Phase B will continue beyond the first three
years of pre-operational startup activities through completion of the five years of waste
acceptance and transportation operations as a Phase B activity concurrent with Phase C activities. 
<p>

<h4>2.4  PHASE C - SNF ACCEPTANCE AND TRANSPORT</h4>
<p>
Commencement of Phase C will be dependent on establishment of SNF receiving capability at a
Federal Facility.  When Phase C activities are authorized,  the RSA shall commence waste
acceptance operations and transportation and delivery of Purchaser SNF to the Federal Facility. 
Additionally, the RSA shall provide NRC approved storage modules suitable for use at the NRC
licensed Federal Facility for storage of the canistered SNF delivered by the RSA.  In addition,
when authorized by OCRWM, the RSA will provide NRC approved storage systems and
canisters, in accordance with the Regional Servicing Plan.  These shall be  suitable for use at the
NRC licensed Federal Facility for uncanistered SNF as Phase C deliverables.  
<p>
Specific Phase C work includes: verification of SNF prior to shipment; validation of cask
loading, provision of transport services including in-transit physical protection, routing and pre-notifications; maintenance of a communications capability; provision of all heavy-haul and
intermodal transfer support; acquisition of permits; and maintenance of equipment.  The RSA
shall accept title to the SNF on behalf of OCRWM and shall act as the Shipping Agent on behalf
of OCRWM.
<p>
As indicated in <a href="1intro.htm#1.4.1">Section 1.4.1 </a> above, the first two years of SNF delivery are planned to be
made using only dual-purpose systems.  When the Federal Facility attains the capability  to
receive uncanistered SNF and OCRWM provides authorization, the RSA may commence
shipping uncanistered SNF to the Federal Facility in accordance with the Regional Servicing
Plan.
