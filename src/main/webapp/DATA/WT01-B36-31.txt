<h4>CHAPTER TWO</h4>

<h3>THE HARVARD HAPPENINGS</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>1961</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At Harvard University in the early sixties,
students had not yet discovered pot; the great majority were into
booze, and there was considerable emphasis on physical prowess
and middle-class, American WASP values. They had not escaped from
the prison of their conditioning and the grand diagonal of crisis
in student sensibilities was between those who went to football
games and those who didn't. There was also a snob element, the
Ivy League ethos, which pervaded the campus. Harvard was a sort
of club designated by the <i>imprimatur</i> of the establishment.
Yet 1961 was to herald a change of consciousness that was to have
a seismic effect not only on the sensibilities of many Harvard
students but on all sections of American culture. I refer of
course to the advent of psychedelic drugs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Leary had returned from a holiday in Mexico where
he had first taken the Sacred Mushroom called teonancatl or
'flesh of the gods' which had been used as a kind of sacrament in
Aztec religious rites, with a history going back more than 2000
years. The botanical name for this narcotic mushroom is <i>Psilocybe
mexicana</i>, which has autonomic side-effects similar to those
of LSD, though milder. According to the Harvard ethnobotanist,
Dr. Richard Schultes, </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>' . . . psychedelic plants act on the central nervous
    system to bring about a dream-like state marked by extreme
    alterations in consciousness of self, in the understanding of
    reality, in the sphere of experience, and usually marked
    changes in perception of time and space; they almost
    invariably induce a series of visual hallucinations, often in
    kaleidoscopic movement, usually in rather indescribably
    brilliant and rich and unearthly colour, frequently
    accompanied by auditory and other hallucinations and
    varieties of synesthesias.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>Psilocybe mexicana</i> mushroom was
synthesised by Dr. Albert Hofmann in 1958 at the Sandoz
Laboratories and given the trade name <i>Psilocybin</i>. It was
one of a range of psychedelic (mind-manifesting, mind-opening)
plants which dramatically alter psychological functions such as
mood, sensation, perception, consciousness, and cognitive
function, which are described as 'mystico-revelatory' by various
investigators, but statements about the subjective effects and
clinical differences among these substances are, at this stage of
our knowledge, in the realm of folklore. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There is considerable disagreement in the
literature as to the interpretation of the effects of
psychedelics, but there is substantial, one might say unanimous,
accord on one major point: they do drastically alter human
consciousness. They apparently knock out inhibitory processes in
the nervous system (which select, discriminate, censor, evaluate)
and they thus release an enormous flow of previously screened-out
awareness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The words which one uses to describe the
psychedelic experience depend upon the investigator's cultural
background, his language repertoire, his literary breadth. If you
usually label 'psychotic' anything which lies outside the
middle-class cultural ego of your tribe, you will call these
psychedelic experiences pathological. If you define 'maturity' in
terms of those modes of perception popular in urban America of
1961, then you may call any experience outside these limits as
'regressive'. It was Leary's thesis that the psychedelic effect
is a <i>transcendental experience, accompanied by intense
positive or negative psychological reactions</i>. There is
transcendence of space-time categories, of the ego, of
subject-object worlds of experience, of words. There is usually a
sense of unity or 'oneness' with internal and external process
which can be ecstatic and exalting, but which can also be
frightening to the unprepared person in a strange or
non-supportive physical setting. Whilst most psychologists tend
to emphasise the pathological reactions; most subjects, who do
not think in pathological categories, stress the positive aspects
of the drug experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This would suggest that specificity of reaction to
a psychedelic drug is primarily a function of set and setting. If
the mental set of the subject and the physical setting or
environment are positive, supportive, anxiety-free, then the
reaction of the subject will be ecstatic, insightful, and
educational. If the set and setting are clinical, experimental,
non-supportive, and impersonal, then the reactions will be
frightening and confusing. Take the case of the American Indians
who still use peyote in connection with their religion. The
peyote rite is one of prayer and quiet contemplation. Their
doctrine consists of belief in God, brotherly love, care of
family and other worthy beliefs. Peyote is conceived of as a
sacrament, a holy god-given food and an available means of
communion with the Spirit of the Almighty. When ingested, it
causes the worshipper to experience a vivid revelation in which
he 'sees' or 'hears' the spirit of a departed loved one, or
experiences other religious phenomena; or he may be shown the way
to solve some daily problem, and experience a deep reverential
attitude to the divine; sometimes he may be reproved for some
evil thought or deed. For the Indian, there is nothing debasing
or morally reprehensible about using a psychedelic substance to
establish contact with the gods, for he believes the peyote
cactus to be of divine origin. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the modern-day Westerner, the psychedelic
experience can be very unexpected, seeing how personality is the
product of conscious and unconscious imprinting as it may also be
seen as the subjective expression of the society in which we
happen to be brought up. We like to believe in the general
regularity of our mental life, in the constancy of our views or
opinions, and like to think how much we are alike, our so-called
normality. But in the psychedelic state, our mind seems to obey
no rules and, except in trivial ways, seems to exist outside the
scope of ordinary rational consciousness. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not surprising, therefore, that psychedelic
drugs like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and peyote were considered
by the American psychological establishment as <i>psychotomimetic</i>
agents, and in the literature we note that researchers use the
language of psychopathology to describe mystical and ecstatic
experiences, in what Leary calls 'catalogues of anguish and
conflict'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychiatric researcher is trained to see the
world through negative, pathological lenses. He is myopic and
cannot see the wood for the trees. When he observes mystical or
transcendental or ecstatic reactions the psychiatrist falls back
on the concepts to which he is committed. He uses the language of
pathology. Psychedelic drugs produce reactions which are not
conventional. Somebody else's ecstasy always looks rather bizarre
or foolish or insane to such an observer. Since ecstatic
behaviours are not conventional and 'normal' it follows that they
must be abnormal. Psychotic. Crazy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A typical psychiatric interpretation reads like
this: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'This paper describes our initial pilot study of clinical
    effects of psilocybin. The volunteers selected were told only
    that they might receive a substance which would produce
    temporary changes in perception and bodily feelings or an
    inert substances A baseline EEG, mental status and checklist
    of symptoms was completed before the drug was administered. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; (Notice the suggestive use of a 'list of symptoms';
a researcher not oriented towards pathology could have checked
the subject out on a list of ecstasies and illuminating
experiences.) </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The experiment was conducted in a dark room. A nurse or
    doctor or both were constantly in attendance. Every fifteen
    minutes the psychiatrist rated the subject's responses on the
    checklist and conducted a mental status examination.
    Volunteers were told that they might be required to remain in
    the hospital for twenty-four hours, but only in two instances
    (out of fourteen) was this necessary. Results visual
    hallucinations, illusions, a form of hyperacusis, body image
    distortions, euphoria, anxiety, depression, blocking,
    disorganised thinking, distractibility, flight of ideas,
    clang associations, inability to abstract. A subject in
    response to the proverb &quot;People in glass houses
    shouldn't throw stones'' said before the drug, &quot;You
    shouldn't point out faults in others that might exist in
    yourself&quot;. After the drug he said, 'At who? That depends
    on a lot of things.&quot; Autonomic responses, pupillary
    dilation, nausea, dizziness, flushing, abdominal complaints,
    blood pressure and pulse.... Usage of these drugs especially
    in an out-patient setting is fraught with the danger and
    should be undertaken only with the greatest caution.
    Psilocybin, LSD and mescaline are extremely potent agents
    capable of producing acute psychotic behaviour in many
    individuals. Depression with the ever-present risk of suicide
    may develop during or after their administration. Additional
    post-drug effects also occur. Once a patient has been
    entrusted with a hallucinogen even when instructed to take
    the drug in small doses, below the hallucinogenic threshold,
    we have no control over the number of pills he may take. The
    use of hallucinogens should be restricted to research in a
    hospital setting.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The genius of Leary was that he avoided the
behaviourist approach to the study and use of psychedelics. Avoid
labelling, depersonalising the subject. Don't impose your own
scientific jargon or your own experimental game models. Do not
set out to validate the redundant implications of your own
premises. Do not limit yourself to the pathological hypotheses.
Do not interpret ecstasy as mania; calm serenity as catatonia; we
must not diagnose Buddha as a detached schizoid; nor Christ as an
exhibitionist and/or masochist; nor the mystic experience as a
symptom; nor the visionary state as a model psychosis. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Right from the start the Harvard Psychedelic
Project was surrounded by a charged field of excitement, glamour,
adventure, enthusiasm, mystery, hyperbole, passion, controversy.
Those who were running the show were charismatic, distinguished,
articulate and colourful. Whilst the majority of the Harvard
faculty was content to observe the world, our message was
revolutionary: if things are not right, then let's change them.
LSD et as was the New Heresy that gave birth to momentous social
change in the form of a New Radicalism, which had as its core the
experience of transcendence. Man could take a 'third eye' view of
himself. He could escape from the prison of his conditioning, his
robot-self, and move towards wholeness, completeness,
place-in-the-world. We could all be conscious agents in the
evolutionary process. This was to be our brave Golden Age of
Anarchy when man would free himself from the dehumanisation of
self-perpetuating, oligarchical bureaucracies and build a new,
socialised, humanized super-society. We wanted to make
'turning-on' a natural part of modern man's existence, for the
experience of liberation from the tyranny of the ego is an
experience so extraordinary, so unique, that it is never
forgotten by the individual&#151;indeed, the vision is the
impetus to behaviour change. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Our offices at that time were located in an old,
remodelled Cambridge house&#151;Five Divinity Avenue. About nine
faculty members and seventy graduate students in psychology used
the building as their place of research and study, and it was a
division of the Social Relations Department. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As fate or chance would have it, the building was
called Morton Prince House after one of the first American
psychologists to recognise alterations in consciousness as a
critical area for research. Morton Prince would still be
considered 'far out' today with his curious and bold interests in
multiple personality, hypnosis, trance states and visionary
experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It seemed somehow most natural and proper that we
should be initiating a research into altered states of
consciousness in this building. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Although Morton Prince was the founder of the
Center he was not the first Harvard scholar to adventure boldly
into the uncharted realms of inner space. The lineage of this
research can be traced to the turn of the century, to that most
venerable and greatest of American psychologists, William James,
who saw that if the riddle of consciousness was to be solved then
the researcher must use psychophysical means on himself. James
tried the peyotl cactus, the sacramental food of the
Indians&#151;only to be daunted by the stumbling block of nausea.
He also tried nitrous oxide (laughing gas) as an available means
of enlarging consciousness, and refers to his experiences in his
classic work, <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Some years ago I myself made some observations on this
    aspect of nitrous oxide intoxication, and reported them in
    print. One conclusion was forced upon my mind at that time,
    and my impression of its truth has ever since remained
    unshaken. It is that our normal waking consciousness,
    rational consciousness as we call it, is but one special type
    of consciousness, whilst all about it, parted from it by the
    filmiest of screens, there lie potential forms of
    consciousness entirely different. We may go through life
    without suspecting their existence; but apply the requisite
    stimulus, and at a touch they are there in all their
    completeness, definite types of mentality which probably
    somewhere have their field of application and adaptation. No
    account of the universe in its totality can be final which
    leaves these other forms of consciousness quite disregarded.
    How to regard them is the question&#151;for they are so
    discontinuous with ordinary consciousness. Yet they may
    determine attitudes though they fail to give a map. At any
    rate, they forbid a premature closing of our accounts with
    reality. Looking back on my own experiences, they all
    converge towards a kind of insight to which I cannot help
    ascribing some metaphysical significance. The keynote of it
    is invariably a reconciliation. It is as if the opposites of
    the world whose contradictoriness and conflict make all our
    difficulties and troubles, were melted into unity. Not only
    do they as contrasted species, belong to one and the same
    genus, but <i>one of the species</i> the nobler and better
    one, <i>is itself the genus and so soaks up and absorbs its
    opposite into itself.</i> This is a dark saying, I know, when
    thus expressed in terms of common logic, but I cannot wholly
    escape from its authority. I feel as if it must mean
    something, something like what the Hegelian philosophy means,
    if one could only lay hold of it more clearly. Those who have
    ears to hear, let them hear; to me the living sense of its
    reality only comes in the artificial mystic state of mind.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So the genealogical line of research in altered
consciousness at Harvard starts with William James and from him
to Morton Prince. And after Prince came another giant of
psychology: Henry A. Murray, who was the director of the Center. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor Murray used fantasy, dream legend,
folklore, mystic vision, poetry and esoteric writings as the raw
material of his work on human personality. It was perhaps
inevitable that he would request a psychedelic session, and in
the spring of 1961 he took the drug for the first time. As he
said of his decision afterwards, 'Curiosity and the envisaged
possibility that I might revel in a little efficacious lunacy
spurred me on to it. Why not?' It was a bold decision for a
modern behavioural scientist at a time when the behaviourists
were the tough-minded guys who wanted to apply impeccable
scientific methodology to the study of the human organism, hiding
their mediocrity and lack of imagination behind 'scientific'
models, techniques, and mechanical 'designs' of the mind which
are by definition mediocre and unimaginative, generating
triviality and error. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Professor Murray realised that modern man is
sitting on top of a simmering volcano. The psychedelic experience
is one possible solution to avoid the deepening chaos; but
thinkers, philosophers, psychologists and scholars have been
singularly reticent about the possibility of expanding man's
awareness and as a group are disinclined to face up to the
existence of this new range of mind-changing chemicals by modern
synthetic chemistry. If the minds of men are blind, then surely
we should utilise whatever available means we have to restore
true vision. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The psychedelic experience and the insights it
provides entail the obligation to communicate and to listen.
Revelation and response are not a man's private affair; for the
revelation comes to one man for all men, and in his response he
is representative of mankind. And since the response is
representative it endows the recipient of revelation, in relation
to his fellow men, with the authority of the prophet. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But here we come to the central problem. Spiritual
fervour is not necessarily accompanied by tact; and men at large
do not willingly recognise a new voice of authority when they
hear it. ( <i>Vide</i> Leary, Aldous Huxley, Herald Hear, Alan
Watts, Robert Graves, Henry Murray). The difficulties are
infinitely aggravated in our present-day world of easy mass
communication which encourages a multiplicity of successive and
often parallel authorities whose rival claims extend all over the
place by virtue of the large followership which they have found.
I think if a Jesus or a Buddha were to appear in our midst today
he would be hard pressed to convince anyone of the relevance to
mankind of his teachings. We find ourselves in a situation that
Aldous Huxley, the patron saint of the psychedelic movement,
touches on in his essay 'Art and the Obvious', where he talks of
the incompetence and vulgarity with which the great obvious
truths have been trivialised by hacks, and goes on to say that
'on some of the most sensitive and self-conscious artists of our
age, this state of affairs has had a curious and unprecedented
effect. They have become afraid of the obviousness of things, the
great as well as the little.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But perhaps the communication of an old obvious
truth&#151;that the fullest kind of maturity has its core in the
experience of personal transcendence&#151;consists not so much in
looking for new things to do as in finding new and relevant ways
of doing the obvious things. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is evident that every scientific, ethical,
aesthetic and spiritual advance has been made by individuals who,
to some extent, broke out of the prison of their linguistic and
social conditioning. And when we consider the present situation
of the world, we see that advancing technology has rendered our
prevailing nationalistic and militaristic culture completely
obsolete, inappropriate and appallingly dangerous. Populations,
civilisations and their rulers are everywhere the prisoners of
this obsolete culture. They can't escape. Indeed, they have been
so thoroughly conditioned that, although on the intellectual
level they are aware of their danger, they do not, on the
subconscious levels really want to escape. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What can be done to help individuals to become the
beneficiaries of language and culture without, at the same time,
becoming their prisoners and passive victims, or running amok
under the intoxicating influence of misused words? There are
several 'obvious' things that might be done.- We can give young
people (and adults) instruction in the nature, limitations and
capabilities for evil as well as for good, of language. We can
drum into their heads (as every wise man from Buddha and Saint
Paul down to those of the present has always done) that words are
not the same as things, that concepts are not experiences, that
pigeon-holes do not exist in nature, that it is both stupid and
unjust to hang a dog because somebody has given him a bad name
(Hitler massacred six million Jews who were regarded not as human
beings, but as the embodiment of a bad name). We must teach our
youth to take their ease with words, naively, by reflex. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These thoughts are pretty 'obvious' to those who
use psychedelics. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(Huxley: Private correspondence.) 'The accelerating rate
    of technological advance, of preparation for war, and of
    population increase leaves the human race very little time in
    which to get out of the prevailing mess. Perhaps within a
    decade the difficulties created by increasing pressure of
    numbers upon resources and by the disruptive impact of
    technology upon established behaviour patterns, may easily
    involve the whole world in a deepening chaos, to which the
    only antidote will be the iron dictatorship of generals or
    commissars. Those of us who worked with psychedelic drugs
    believed that within this short period we must try to train
    up a sufficient and effective minority of individuals,
    capable of profiting by language and culture without being
    stultified or made mad by them, capable of changing obsolete
    behaviour patterns in such a way that mankind may find it
    possible to live in conformity, not with disastrous slogans
    and dogmas inherited from the past, but with the life
    process, the essential Suchness of the world.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My own view is that LSD may be nothing more than
the extreme lengths to which a handful of individuals were
prepared to go in order to ensure the continuity of their
necessary freedoms. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This slight digression over, let us return to the
activities at Five Divinity Avenue, to that tiny group led by
Leary and sustained by Murray, who were to fiddle with
irrelevancies while the giant powers multiplied their infernal
weapons, threats, and provocations. As soon as it became known
that a research project involving the use of these new
psychedelic drugs was to be organised, large numbers of graduate
students came round to join the project. There were many planning
sessions, and an air of excitement pervaded Morton Prince House.
We also examined the available literature on the subject,
including the works of Aldous Huxley&#151;<i>Heaven and Hell</i>
and <i>The Doors of Perception</i> which detailed his experiences
with mescaline, as well as his novel <i>Island</i> about a
'positive Utopia' in which psychedelic drugs are used by a
community to help expand awareness and bring its members closer
to God. It was Huxley's solution to the problems and horrors he
described so dramatically in <i>Brave New World</i> and <i>Ape
and Essence</i>. There were also Leary's papers on the subject as
well as monographs by Frank Barron, a leading American authority
of creativity, Richard Alpert, a member of the Harvard Faculty,
and William Burroughs. It was not much, but it was enough to
start planning sessions based on non-clinical methodologies. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My job at this time was as an assistant to Leary. I
was living in his house and we would drive to the office each
morning from Boston, just across the river from Cambridge. I was
also given a course to teach, two hours a week, when I would meet
with perhaps a dozen graduate students in psychology to plan and
discuss LSD sessions. We would sit around discussing how best to
run group sessions, the function of the 'guide' or administrator,
and the ethical and interpersonal principles involved. The
atmosphere of the Center hadn't been this stirred since Harry
Murray was trying to solve the Lindberg kidnapping, since Morton
Prince tried to get in touch with the co-conscious 'spirit
world', since William James started a rage of nitrous oxide
parties in Boston's Back Bay. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What we wanted to achieve was an 'open',
collaborative and humanistic response to our research in order to
produce optimally positive reactions to the drug experience. And
by 'positive reaction' we meant a pleasant, ecstatic, non-anxious
experience leading to a broadening of awareness and an increase
in individual insight. The following principles were laid down by
the team: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Participants whenever possible will alternate
roles of observer and subject. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Participants will be given all available
information about the drug and its effects before the experiment.
We will attempt to avoid an atmosphere of mystery and secret
experimentation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The participants will be given control of their
own dosage. A maximum dosage will be determined by the principal
investigators. This maximum number of tablets will be given the
subject and he will be told to dose himself at the rate and
amount he desires. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. The sessions will take place in pleasant,
spacious aesthetic surroundings. Music, art reproductions,
sympathetic observers will be available. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. The subject will be allowed to bring a relative
or friend to be his observer. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. No subject should take the drug in a group where
he is a stranger. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 7. An attempt will be made to have one observer for
each two subjects. The subjects will be given complete freedom of
the house but cannot leave the premises. Observers will be
available at all times for discussion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 8. Observers will be present at the end of the
session for follow-up discussions. </p>

<p> It is interesting to look back at some of the original
members of the Harvard Psychedelic Project, who were first
introduced to LSD via the contents of the magic mayonnaise jar,
and to note their successive and deepening involvement in the
psychedelic movement, which was to spread from Harvard to all
sections of our Western culture as well as introduce a new
vocabulary for a turned-on youth movement ('psychedelic', 'acid',
'trip', 'stoned'); new slogans ('turn on, tune in, drop out');
new artistic forms (psychedelic art, acid rock, psychedelic
discotheques, a Beatle album openly celebrating the psychedelic
experience); new drug-associated organizations (The International
Federation for Internal Freedom [IFIF] in Cambridge, The Agora
Scientific Trust in New York, The World Psychedelic Centre in
London, The Castalia Foundation at Millbrook); new religions (The
Neo-American Church, The League for Spiritual Discovery, The Free
High Church of Cumbrae [Scotland], The Church of the Awakening,
San Francisco); new life-styles (head shops, ashrams, communes,
The Brotherhood of Eternal Love); an underground newspaper
service; new literary forms and themes <i>(High Priest, Time
Psychedelic Review, The Ecstatic Adventure, The Psychedelic
Experience, Psychedelic Prayers, The Varieties of Psychedelic
Experience)</i> and so on and so forth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Along the crowded corridors of the Center walked
Aldous and Laura Huxley, Arthur Koestler, William Burroughs,
Charles Olson, Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky, famous
musicians and painters, ministers, cured dope addicts, New York
hipsters, oriental religious leaders, rabbis and even a couple of
Jesuits. 'There is some possibility that my friends and I have
illuminated more people than anyone else in history.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not long before the Harvard Research Project
had grown to include some forty professors and graduate students,
who had sensed in the psychedelic experience a new tool with
which to shape and extend their awareness of the world and the
other people in it. And their claims on behalf of LSD et al were
highly articulate, and perhaps tinged with a fervour usually
associated with religious belief. Naturally, this had a
disturbing effect on their colleagues, who were doing <i>real</i>
psychology&#151;Delay of Gratification Experiments; Need for
Achievement; Personality Studies of Lower-Class Irish in South
Boston; The Rorschach Test; Need for Approval; Perception and
Motivation Studies. Psychology was the science of rats and tests
and statistics. Exploring and mapping new realms of internal
experience didn't belong here. Or did it ? Who could now really
say ? The hermetic vase had been opened, and the <i>avis Hermetis</i>
had flown the nest. The dynamic life-giving adventure of
exploring <i>inner space</i> was to become the <i>new romance</i>.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was inevitable that, as our drug programme
expanded, criticism and rumour began to flourish about our
activities. One of the most vocal of the critics was Professor
David McClelland, a professor of psychology, a protestant-ethic
man, highly intelligent, an expert in the psychological basis of
'fantasy', a prominent Quaker, dedicated to external achievement.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; McClelland had decided to bring matters to a head
by calling a meeting of the staff of the Center in which he
revealed in no uncertain terms his growing concern over the
Psychedelic Project. To judge by the behaviour of Mexican <i>curanderas</i>
and Indian mystics, he said, one would expect the chief effects
of psychedelic substances to be to encourage withdrawal from
contact with social reality and to increase satisfaction with
one's own inner thought life. Research reports from the current
Harvard project, he said, 'are not inconsistent with these
expectations'. And went on to note that 'initiates begin to show
a certain blandness, or superiority, or feeling of being above
and beyond the normal worlds of social reality'. He was concerned
about a developing interpersonal insensitivity, about the
'inability to predict in advance what the social reaction of a
&quot;psilocybin party&quot; would be'. And religious and
philosophical naiveté: 'Many reports are given of deep mystical
experiences, but their chief characteristic is the wonder at
one's own profundity rather than a genuine concern to probe
deeper into the experience of the human race in these matters',
and impulsivity: 'One of the most difficult parts of the research
has been to introduce any order into who takes the drug under
what conditions. Any controls have either been rejected as
interfering with the warmth necessary to have a valuable
experience or accepted as desirable but then not applied because
somehow an occasion arises when it seems &quot;right&quot; to
have a psychedelic session'. He concluded his statements with
this warning: 'It is probably no accident that the society which
most consistently encouraged the use of these substances India,
produced one of the sickest social orders ever created by mankind
in which thinking men spent their time lost in the Buddha
position under the influence of drugs exploring consciousness,
while poverty, disease, social discrimination, and superstition
reached their highest and most organised form in all history.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Another critic, Dr. Herbert Kelman, lecturer in
Social Psychology, said at a later meeting that he had observed
that graduate students in the project had formed clannish
'insider groups'. 'I also question whether this project is
carried out primarily as an intellectual endeavour or whether it
is being pursued as a new kind of experience to offer an answer
to man's ills,' he said. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The problem was one of communication, or rather the
lack of any, for we had let the rumours go unchecked. From the
point of view of those of us working on the project, psychedelic
drugs had an amazing potential, not only as aids to psychotherapy
but in such areas as prisoner rehabilitation, personal growth and
individual freedom, interpersonal community structures, improved
human relations, creativity, art and entertainment, education,
religion and philosophy, politics and sociology, experimental
behavioural science, to mention just a few of the practical
applications we had pursued. We came to believe, as a result of
our own experiences and those reported to us by others using
psychedelics, that they had the potential to facilitate for the
individual the experience of major insights and problem solutions
of an intellectual-emotional nature. The realm of these insights
or problem solutions is in any area which is meaningful to that
individual be it social or personal, intellectual, religious,
philosophical, things like that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was also our conviction that these insights,
enlightenment or solutions provided a firm educational foundation
for (a) change in the social or intellectual behaviour of the
individual, (b) the development of new models regarding the
nature of man along with suitable research designs to test such
models, (c) the development of more subtle methods of
communication between individuals and (d) the conceptualization
and formulation of modified social systems. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We tried to counter the criticisms by gathering
together some of the students who had used psychedelics, at which
time phenomenological reports were made. We also had two graduate
students in the Harvard Divinity School and one student from
M.I.T. Philosophy Department attending who were considering Ph.D.
dissertations in this area. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We also brought out a Newsletter in which we tried
to illustrate the impact of the psychedelic experience by quotes
from subjects' reports: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The atmosphere could hardly have been made more pleasant
    and congenial. The freedom, spontaneity, and personal warmth
    within the group and between members of the group became very
    meaningful. In these moments the psychology <i>vs</i>.
    theology business dropped off, the faculty-student barrier
    just did not matter, even the friend-stranger game was
    minimised. For these few moments we interacted not as role
    players or status seekers but as human beings&#151;men who
    share common sorrows and common joys, some of which we
    discussed. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Things going on inside me took all my attention. Early in
    my session I fastened upon the question of the distinction
    between knower and known, recalling Allport's and Hall and
    Lindzey's discussion of whether the self should be
    conceptualized in terms of the processes of knowing
    (self-as-subject, James' pure Ego) or in terms of the
    structures, patterns, abstractions by which one defines
    himself (self-as-object, proprium). It seemed to me that
    these were being dissociated in me, and I as knower was
    unable to confirm my knowing or to sustain my sense of
    identity by referring to any stable elements of myself. I
    recall looking at a Buddhist symbol, a circle divided into
    two S-shaped parts, one black and one white, with a centre in
    each of the semi-circles which formed the S. I struggled to
    bring the two centres together, as if &quot;the 1&quot; had
    to do so to survive. I can remember twisting and straining
    with all my might, saying I-I-I-I-I and somehow being aware
    that the batter of my universe was to maintain the
    &quot;I&quot; while all else was stripped away. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Two related feelings were present. One was a tremendous
    freedom to experience, to be I. It became very important to
    distinguish between <i>I</i> and <i>Me</i>, the latter being
    an object defined by patterns and structures and
    responsibilities&#151;all of which had vanished&#151;and the
    former being the subject experiencing and feeling. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'What it all means: First, for psychological theory. One
    striking aspect of the experience was the lack of sexual
    feelings or thoughts. We all commented upon this. Another was
    the lack of aggression&#151;moments of irritability produced
    only a desire to move away from the irritating one. Moreover,
    I experienced no developmental regression. While this does
    not in any way disprove Freudian theory, it makes it utterly
    irrelevant to this experience.... </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'To begin with, the usual: the experience is so fantastic
    in both its novelty and its power as to beggar all
    possibility of adequate depiction through words. The most
    that can be hoped for by way of description is an
    approximation, and only those who have had the drug can know
    how far removed from actuality the approximation must be. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The things that can be said easily and unequivocally are:
    (I) My physical symptoms were a pronounced quaking which
    centred in my lower limbs, climaxing (I would judge) about
    one and a half hours after taking the drug but continuing off
    and on for about five hours; a slight stomach cramp for about
    ten hours; the feeling of physical depletion&#151;having been
    wrung through a wringer&#151;on coming out of the spell; and
    inability to sleep (bright flashes of light) until 3.00 a.m.
    (2) No disorientation&#151;at no point did I lose awareness
    of who I was, where I was, or the group experience that was
    underway. (3) Considerable apprehension, but no real terror
    or paranoia. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Now to the difficult part. The best way I can describe
    the experience as a whole is to liken it to an
    emotional-reflective-visual kaleidoscope, with the words
    listed in order of decreasing importance&#151;mood and
    emotion most important, thought next, visual (internal, of
    the sort you can get with your eyes closed) least. Experience
    involving these three components kept dissolving continuously
    from one pattern into another. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Emotionally the patterns ranged from serene contentment
    and mild euphoria to apprehension which bordered on, but
    never slipped into, alarm, but overwhelmingly they involved
    (a) astonishment at the absolutely incredible immensity,
    complexity, intensity and extravagance of being, existence,
    the cosmos, call it what you will. Ontological shock, I
    suppose. (b) The most acute sense of the poignancy,
    fragility, preciousness, and significance of all life and
    history. The latter was accompanied by a powerful sense of
    the responsibility of all for all&#151;all this, it must be
    pointed out, while lying comfortably and privately flat on
    one's back. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Intellectually, the dominant impression was that of
    entering into the very marrow of existence. Instead of
    looking at a painting, I was climbing into it, almost through
    it, as if to view it from behind. So too with being in
    general. It was as if each of the billion atoms of experience
    which under normal circumstances are summarised and averaged
    into crude, indiscriminate wholesale impressions was now
    being seen and savoured for itself. The other clear sense was
    that of cosmic relativity. Perhaps all experience <i>never</i>
    gets summarised in any inclusive over-view. Perhaps all there
    is is this everlasting congerie of an infinite number of
    discrete points of view, each summarising the whole from its
    perspective with the sum of all perspectives running the
    entire gamut from terror to absolute assurance and ecstasy. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'During the supper, after the two groups had gathered
    together I found myself disinclined to speak much. And the
    reason seemed clear&#151;and still does. Several times a
    thought began to take shape. But immediately one saw three or
    four feasible (and very different) ways any overt expression
    of it could be taken: straightforward, platitudinous,
    farcical, too personally revelatory to be publicly broadcast,
    etc. As language seemed too gross and clumsy to screen out
    the senses 1 did not intend, it seemed, not so much more
    prudent as more truthful in the sense of
    not-multiplying-misunderstanding, to remain for the most part
    quiet. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Felt clean&#151;cleansed, actually&#151;clear and happy
    the next day; the reverse to about equal degree the day
    following: normal, thereafter.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We also tried to scotch the rumours by 'coming out
front' and including mention of them in the Newsletter: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'During the fall of 1961 reports circulated in Manhattan
    literary, artistic and intellectual circles about the
    availability of black market hallucinogenic drugs, allegedly
    psilocybin. These substances were sold in liquid form.
    Because of our interest in the anthropology of
    consciousness-altering substances we investigated these
    reports. Conversations with a physician who analysed this
    liquid revealed it to be a form of LSD mixed with another
    substance, probably amphetamine. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In December we were informed about the case of a
    well-known model who had been wandering for several weeks in
    lower Manhattan in a delirious state which was attributed to
    liquid &quot;mushrooms&quot;. A New York businessman who is
    producing a movie on the Mexican mushroom heard of this
    case&#151;his wife being a former friend of the model. The
    girl was located and a physician called. The girl made an
    apparent recovery. After a week, at the suggestion of the
    physician, and at our invitation the girl came to Boston for
    a rest. We had anticipated that we could assist her in
    integrating her experience into her life. However, she was
    immediately seen to be suffering from a severer psychosis. A
    psychiatrist was called and hospitalization arranged in a
    local hospital. Subsequent investigations have determined
    that the girl had probably been functionally psychotic for
    several months. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'On Saturday, morning 7 October, we were asked for help by
    an undergraduate who knew of our work and was concerned about
    his girl. It seemed that he had obtained (from New York) and
    taken a hallucinogen the previous evening and had spent this
    evening with his girl, who was, apparently, already quite
    emotionally disturbed as the result of a series of recent
    traumatic experiences. During the night, although the girl
    did not take any drugs herself, she was affected by the
    situation, so much so that she lost contact with reality a
    number of times during the course of the evening. After a
    review of the situation, we arranged for the girl to see a
    Cambridge psychiatrist whom she reported having visited
    previously. We have continued to see the boy up to the
    present time in order to help him integrate and make use of
    his experience. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'A recent rumour suggested that the punch at a University
    function had been &quot;spiked&quot; with hallucinogens by a
    student who obtained the material from us. In fact, our
    materials are carefully safeguarded and are signed out <i>only</i>
    to the members of our staff (who sign a requisition for all
    material) for specified research purposes. We were unable to
    ascertain the source of the rumour. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>'In the fall of 1961 members of our research group were
    approached by and met twice with several young men who have
    been informally experimenting with conscious-altering
    substances. All of these young men were or had been Harvard
    undergraduates. They wanted to talk with us about their
    experiences, and particularly about their plans for a model
    free community in Mexico. Two of these young men did go to
    Mexico to look for a location, but they returned to
    Cambridge. To our knowledge no community has been
    established. In our discussions with these men we found them
    to be imaginative, decent, and full of youthful exuberance.
    We did nothing to encourage their use of conscious-altering
    substances. Rather, we expressed concern about the
    clandestine atmosphere in which they used these substances
    and talked very frankly with them about the frightening
    experiences that stem from secretiveness, suspicion, and
    fear.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Newsletter ended with a paragraph about 'Group
leaders': </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'There is, at present, a group of psychologists who,
    during the past year have become very familiar with
    psilocybin and its effects. They have each participated in a
    number of sessions both as member and leader. We start with
    this group as a nucleus of administrators. The group
    includes: Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert, Michael Kahn, George
    Litwin, Ralph Metzner, Gunther Weil, Ralph Schwitzgebel,
    Michael Hollingshead. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the paranoia was not restricted to Harvard. The
Press were having a field-day, and reports of our activities
began to appear in such mass-circulation magazines as <i>The
Reporter</i> ('The Hallucinogenic Drug Cult'); <i>Look</i>
('Weird Story of Harvard's Drug Scandal'), and even an article
entitled 'Psycho Chemicals as Weapons' which appeared in <i>The
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>, which prompted us to reply
in an article duly published in their next issue; our article was
headed 'The Politics of the Nervous System'.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'The article by Dr. E. James Lieberman entitled
    &quot;Psycho Chemicals as Weapons&quot; (January, 1962) could
    lead to serious confusion in the minds of a credulous public
    and of a credulous military. The author seems to be moved by
    admirable democratic sentiments, but he has mixed together an
    astonishing combination of psychiatric folklore and chemical
    warfare fantasy. The results are misleading. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The so-called &quot;psychotropic weapons&quot;
    emphasised in this article are Lysergic Acid Diethylamide
    (LSD), Mescaline (the synthetic of the &quot;divine peyote
    cactus&quot;), and Psilocybin (the synthetic of the Sacred
    Mushroom of Mexico). The author, a psychiatrist, warns that
    &quot;catastrophic damage that would be neither reversible
    nor humane&quot; might follow the ingestion of these drugs. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Dr. Lieberman has presented one of the many
    sharply divergent viewpoints about the interpretation and
    application of these drugs. Many psychiatrists believe that
    LSD, Mescaline and Psilocybin produce psychiatric
    symptoms&#151;anxiety, depression, detachment, confusion,
    suspicion, psychosis. Many other investigators have come to
    the conclusion that these symptoms exist mainly in the mind
    and eye of the psychiatrist, and that consciousness-expanding
    chemicals, far from being dangerous weapons, may produce
    dramatic changes in personality leading to unprecedented
    peace, sanity and happiness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Perhaps it depends on what you are trained to
    look for. Most psychiatrists who have experimented with such
    consciousness-affecting drugs report danger. Most
    non-psychiatrists see these drugs as great benefactors of
    mankind. Included in the latter group are Albert Hofmann, the
    brilliant bio-chemist, who first synthesised LSD and
    Psilocybin; Alan Watts, author and philosopher; Robert S. de
    Ropp, bio-chemist; Aldous Huxley, novelist and philosopher;
    and the great American psychologist and philosopher, William
    James. Also included among those who hail the humanistic
    promise of consciousness-expanding drugs are a few
    psychiatrists who have seen beyond psychopathology to the
    adaptive potentials of the human brain. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'So much for the controversial. Research and
    not words will resolve these issues. But let us look next at
    the secure knowledge which exists concerning Mescaline, LSD,
    and Psilocybin. What are these substances? Sacramental foods?
    Devilish weapons? Wonder medicines? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'It is easier to say what they are not. They
    are not addictive, nor sedative, nor intoxicating. There is
    no evidence for any lasting and very few transient physical
    effects. Everyone agrees on one factor&#151;they dramatically
    alter consciousness and expand awareness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'There is a second generally shared conclusion.
    Set and suggestibility, expectation and emotional atmosphere
    account for almost all of the specificity of reaction. If the
    drug-giver is supportive, open, relaxed, then the results
    will usually be positive, educational, dramatically
    insightful. If, on the other hand, the drug-giver is
    secretive, depersonalised, himself fearful of the drug, then
    the reactions will probably be anxious and unpleasant. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'As members of a research project studying the
    effects and application of consciousness-expanding drugs, we
    have had the opportunity during the last eighteen months of
    observing the behavioural and phenomenological reactions of
    over 300 subjects. A glance at some of our results suggests
    that the military applications of consciousness-expanding
    drugs may be limited. Ninety-one per cent of the Americans
    who have participated in our research report pleasant,
    inspirational experiences. Even with no attempt to be
    therapeutic, and with only one ingestion, over sixty per cent
    of our subjects report subsequent life changes for the
    better. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'During the past twelve months we have used
    these drugs for rehabilitation purposes in a maximum security
    prison. During more than 100 individual ingestions
    with-hardened criminals we have witnessed dramatic insight
    and behaviour change reactions. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Like any product of our advanced technology,
    the consciousness-expanding drugs can be used to manipulate;
    to dominate, to frighten or to benefit mankind. A hypodermic
    syringe of LSD or Salk vaccine in the hands of an enemy can
    become a frightening weapon. However, the greatest enemies of
    mankind are ignorance and fear. In the hands of the
    unfriendly, these weapons&#151;ignorance and fear&#151;can
    paralyse and destroy. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'What are the protections? Accurate
    information, openly shared, calm, courageous response to the
    evidence. Psychiatrists and physicians (on whom Dr. Lieberman
    calls for rescue from danger, perhaps imaginary) can help to
    the extent they are collaborative, open, fearless with their
    fellow men. If the American people are frightened by
    psychopathological obsessions and psychiatric superstitions
    and ill-kept chemical warfare secrets, they can be hurt. We
    are least vulnerable and strongest when we are well-informed.
    Facts are the defence against any weapon, and particularly
    the psychological weapons of fear and helplessness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The facts about consciousness-expanding
    substances are not all in yet, but some things are clear.
    Physiologically these substances act mainly on the brain
    stem, disinhibiting certain regulating, selecting, screening
    and controlling mechanisms that constantly guide our
    perception and thinking. The higher, conscious centres are
    free temporarily from these artificial restrictions.
    Behaviourally the main effect of these substances is
    relaxation. Most of our subjects are very happy just to sit
    and enjoy the world. There is much less talking, much less
    superficial movement or conversation. Let us be clear, almost
    all of our subjects could function very adequately if called
    on. They choose to relax. Psychologically these amazing
    substances expand your awareness, they open your mind. The
    kaleidoscopic and complex world that has always been there,
    the powerful sensations from every part of your body and the
    unusual connections of thoughts and feelings that are
    normally ignored come dramatically into consciousness. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Of course these experiences can be
    frightening. If you are not prepared, if you do not know what
    is happening to you and your brain, if you are struggling to
    maintain complete verbal control over your senses and your
    awareness, you will certainly be frightened and angry. But if
    you are prepared, if you know what kind of a chemical you
    have taken and what to expect (which most subjects
    participating in psychiatric research with these substances
    do not), if you do relax, then the experience can be
    wonderful, enlightening, and life-changing. If an enemy does
    drop LSD in the water supply and if you are accurately
    informed and prepared, then you have two choices. If you have
    the time and inclination you should sit back and enjoy the
    most exciting education experience of your life (you might be
    forever grateful to the saboteur). If you don't have the time
    or the inclination for this pleasant and insightful
    experience, then swallow a tranquilliser (which is a good
    antidote) and you'll be back to the prosaic reality. Tomorrow
    the drugs and the counter-drugs may be different, but the
    prescription is the same. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'If an enemy introduced a
    consciousness-expanding drug into a military command centre,
    our leaders (if they are accurately informed and experienced
    about the potentials of expanded awareness) might find that
    men in certain key positions could function better. In fact,
    we must assume that these substances are now being used by
    our space agency for the preparation of cosmonauts, who will
    certainly undergo altered states of consciousness in space
    exploration. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Your brain is your own. Intelligent, open
    collaboration can expand your mind&#151;with words and with
    drugs. Only ignorance and misinformation can allow someone
    else to control it&#151;with their own words or with their
    drugs or with their imaginary fears.' </p>
