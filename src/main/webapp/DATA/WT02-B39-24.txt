NBD, 1ST CHICAGO EXPECT EASY COMPLIANCE MERGER

The fact that National Bank of Detroit and First Chicago both had
line management compliance systems before they merged Dec. 1 will ease the
future merging of their compliance departments, NBD's general counsel told
RCW.
        The compliance program at the new holding company, First
Chicago/NBD Corp., will probably be run in a similar way, Dan Lis said.
Only the holding companies have currently merged; the only banks that will
merge are in Illinois--NBD Illinois and First National Bank of Chicago--
which will merge at mid-year. At that time NBD will fold into First
National.
        So far, the plan of how to structure the new compliance program
hasn't yet gone to senior management or been implemented, but according to
bank executives this is not a problem.
        "There was no danger in not having a compliance program completely
set up in time for the merger, because our functions and the way the two
banks approached compliance were very similar," said Lis. "We will not have
any gaps in coverage because of this."
        How to merge CRA functions, which are separate from compliance,
also wasn't considered until after the merger. According to M. Chris Snow,
NBD's CRA officer, before Dec. 1 the CRA department was just making sure it
got through the approval process, which included a couple of protests.
"When we sat down to combine our offices, we realized that our public
affairs divisions both held CRA (departments), but were different in other
ways," said Snow. "So far we've only had two meetings to integrate the
departments."
        Lis said that like the pre-merged institutions, First Chicago/NBD
Corp. will probably have corporate compliance officers in each line of
manufacturing business, who will have corporate-wide responsibility. There
will probably also be distribution compliance officers in charge of each
state, since each state operation serves as a distribution arm of products
and services, speculated Lis. Those officers will report to the bank
president of that state.
        Those officers, together with certain executive officers, including
those of the law and auditing departments, will comprise a corporate
compliance committee. The auditing and law departments will serve as
support for the line management.
        Lis said the manufacturing arms of the bank take up such retail
banking functions as mortgage, consumer banking, deposit services and
marketing. Distribution involves the sale of the bank's products.
        "The most significant difference between the new compliance
department and the old ones is that before, at NBD, there was a single
corporate compliance officer. Now we will use the corporate compliance
committee structure, similar to the one First Chicago had," said Lis.
        "There will also be some decrease in personnel due to redundancy as
a result of the transition, not as a result of the new structure. For
example, before we downsize there may be two lawyers who study the same
reg, two compliance officers who monitor it, etc."
        There won't be many problems combining the bank's CRA departments
either, said Snow.
        "Even though First Chicago was a larger bank, its market was small
compared to ours, and its CRA was focused more in their public affairs
group, out of their downtown Chicago office, since they didn't have many
branches," she said. "By contrast, NBD's CRA efforts were spread over five
states, each with a state coordinator. Each state was also broken up into
regions, with a part-time regional person.
        "I think we will move the centralized CRA to Chicago, like the
centralized lending analysis, since our corporate headquarters will be
there, and keep the information flowing back and forth from the regions,"
Snow continued. "We still need to keep the regional efforts because the
needs of each state are different--CRA has to be much closer to the
customer and geography. Before, we had to rely on a local person to tell us
why a trend was the way it was, but the new reg lends itself more to
centralized data.
        "Right now we're not worried about who will be in what job, but
that whatever data analyzer we purchase will be flexible enough to accept
data from any operating system, be it consumer or commercial loan
information. We'll have small business reporting from five different banks.
        "Our CRA department is responsible for choosing the data base
analyzer, and senior management and our technology task force is in charge
of hiring a geocoder and purchasing loan collection systems, since
marketing will also use the information. We'll have some say in the latter,
but not a lot of input."
        "Then we'll make (CRA) lending decisions based on what the numbers
tell us. We would be doing the switch to data collection regardless, but
the merger will make the switch go faster, since we'll already be in a
change mode."
        "We might be hiring a couple of new people to do lending analysis
for the new CRA reg, the number will depend how much we can automate," said
Snow. "Our plan is not to grow our CRA department, since our CRA philosophy
is to keep the authority with the local state bank president or regional
director. We hesitate to hire too many CRA people because it is too easy to
offload the responsibility to them."

LARGE BANKS FACE RISK-BASED EXAMS

By the end of the first quarter, large national banks can expect to
be examined against nine risk factors identified by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.
        The agency's new Supervision by Risk program, released Jan. 4 by
way of its "Large Bank Supervision Handbook," is for national banks with
total assets of at least $1 billion and for banks that are part of multi-
bank holding companies with at least one bank with assets of $1 billion or
more.
        Banks smaller than $1 billion in assets will be treated as
community banks and their new risk-focused exam guidelines are expected by
June.
        Intending to help banks manage risk to capital and earnings,
examiners will focus on credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, foreign
exchange, transaction, compliance, strategic planning and reputation.
Examiners will then put together a customer-tailored profile for each bank.
        While the OCC has been examining banks based on a variety of risks
for several years, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said, the new
handbook marks the national standardization of this process.
        "By delineating and defining each risk, bankers and examiners will,
for the first time, be able to use the same terminology when discussing
risk-related issues, and examiners will be more consistent in their
approach to similar institutions," said Ludwig.
        Supervision by Risk, announced by Ludwig last September, will be
part of banks' annual on-site safety and soundness exams and might also
occur throughout the year in various target examinations.
        If a risk is identified as an unwarranted problem, banks will be
expected to take steps to correct the problem, and examiners will monitor
their progress.
        The OCC has also provided a Risk Assessment System within the
handbook--a checklist within the nine risk categories, for banks' self-
assessment regarding the quantity of risk, the quality of risk management,
the level of supervisory concern, and the direction of risk.
        Within each risk category, examiners will identify whether risk is
increasing, stable, or decreasing in each bank. The new handbook also
emphasizes two-way communication about bank risk between bankers and
examiners.
        According to the handbook, each bank's individualized risk
management program should include identification, measurement, control, and
monitoring of risks.
        The OCC defines the nine risk categories as follows:
         Credit: The risk from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of
any contract or fail to perform as agreed. Credit risk also arises in
conjunction with selecting investment portfolio products, derivatives
trading partners, or foreign exchange counterparties; through country or
sovereign exposure; and through guarantor performance.
         Interest Rate Risk: The risk from movements in interest rates.
Should consider risk from both an accounting perspective (the effect on the
bank's accrual earnings) and the economic perspective (the effect on the
market value of the bank's portfolio equity). In some banks, interest rate
risk is captured under a broader category of market risk.
         Liquidity Risk: The risk from a bank's inability to meet its
obligations when they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses.
Includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding
sources; and the failure to address changes in market conditions that
affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in
value.
         Price Risk: The risk from changes in the value of portfolios of
financial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, and
position-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, and
commodities markets.
         Foreign Exchange Risk: The risk from movement of foreign exchange
rates, found in cross-border investing and operating activities. Market-
making and position-taking in foreign currencies should be captured under
price risk.
         Transaction Risk: The risk from problems with service or product
delivery--a function of internal controls, information systems, employee
integrity, and operating processes.
         Compliance Risk: The risk from violations or non-conformance with
laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards. Also
arises in situations where the laws or rules governing bank activities may
be ambiguous or untested. Compliance risk exposes the bank to fines, civil
money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts.
         Strategic Risk: The risk from adverse business decisions or
improper implementation of those decisions. This risk focuses on more than
an analysis of the written strategic plan; it focuses on how plans,
systems, and implementation affect the bank's franchise value.
         Reputation Risk: The risk from negative public opinion, affecting
the bank's ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue
servicing existing relationships. This risk can expose the bank to
litigation, financial loss, or damage to its reputation. Banks that
actively associate their name with products and services, such as with
fiduciary services, are more likely to have higher reputation risk
exposure.
        Copies of the Large Bank Handbook can be obtained by sending $6 per
booklet to the OCC, P.O. Box 70004, Chicago, Ill. 70673-0004. o
Mortgage Reg OKs Endorsements
        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity Conversion
Mortgage program can now process these loans without approval from the
department. HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approved
lenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its direct
endorsement program.
        Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17, but the final
rule, which appears in the Federal Register, makes the change official; it
also completes one of many streamlining procedures HUD has initiated over
the last several months.
        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECM
that lenders haven't issued a conditional commitment for is eligible for
direct endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insured
before Sept. 15, 1995, must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUD
office for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance. If HUD
deems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, it will give the
lender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DE program. o
Fannie Joins Plan For American Indians
        Lenders will be able to begin offering mortgages to certain
American Indian tribes without the anxieties traditionally associated with
lending on tribal trust lands.
        Starting in January, Fannie will begin taking part in the Rural
Housing Service's Rural Housing Native American pilot, but will limit its
initial participation to 10 tribes.
        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed
$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they have
a good working relationship with the Rural Housing Service and the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be added
later in the pilot.

FLORIDA TO REQUIRE CONTINUING ED. FOR SECURITIES

Mark up Florida as the first state to follow national continuing
education requirements. The Southeastern hotbed for bank securities
activities has become the first state in the nation to require continuing
education for securities dealers.
        A new administrative rule will go into effect for approximately
130,000 securities sales, trading, and investment banking personnel
registered in Florida who have direct client contact, and their immediate
supervisors.
        The rule requires Florida dealers and associated persons to comply
with the same requirements as members of all the national exchanges, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board and the commodities regulatory agencies.
        The rule also exempts registered representatives with 10 years
experience and a flawless disciplinary history from the regulatory
requirements. Reps with the flawless disciplinary records make up about 17%
of Florida's securities sales industry, according to the state securities
regulator. However, all companies will be required to have a written plan

to develop and administer training programs tailored to specific training
needs regarding product lines and sales practices. The program went into
effect at the start of the new year.

BRIEFS


Fed OKs Chase Merger
Before Ending CRA Check
        The Federal Reserve on Jan. 5 approved the merger of Chemical
Banking Corp. with The Chase Manhattan Corp., a $10.4 billion deal that
will create the country's largest bank.
        Despite numerous complaints by community groups under the Community
Reinvestment Act, including two days of hearings in New York City in
November, the Fed didn't include any conditions in its order, other than
requiring the bank to fulfill an $18 billion CRA commitment it announced
last fall.
        The Fed said that both banks meet the credit needs of their
communities, citing Chemical's lead bank's two consecutive "Outstanding"
CRA grades and the Chase lead bank's recent "Satisfactory" ratings.
        Activists were especially angry that the Fed didn't wait for the
OCC to complete its CRA review of Chase before acting on the application.
Instead, it relied on a 1993 exam.
        The merger still has to be approved by the New York State Banking
Department. o
OCC To Relax Rules
On Community Work
        The OCC has proposed streamlining its CRA regulations in order to
spur more community investment by banks. Instead of the four-part test now
required of banks to prove that a community investment is in the public
interest, the OCC would only require banks to self-certify that investments
will benefit LMI families or small businesses.
        The proposal is in the Dec. 28 Fed Register; comments are due by
the beginning of March.
        "The proposed changes encourage national banks and community groups
to work together by allowing them the flexibility to determine how best to
structure their own partnerships in support of community development," said
Comptroller Eugene A. Ludwig.
        According to the OCC, national banks and their community partners
have invested a combined total of $2.16 billion in CDCs and community
development projects since December 1993, when the Community Development
regulation was adopted.
        The proposed revisions preserve the community development focus,
but would:
         Allow national banks greater flexibility to determine if
investments promote the public welfare by modifying the current public
welfare test;
         Retain the requirement that the investment primarily benefit LMI
persons, families, or small businesses, but make it clear that this benefit
can be provided in a variety of different ways;
         Simplify the self-certification and prior approval processes by
eliminating a current five-day OCC review period for investment proposals
that the OCC has previously approved for another bank;
         Eliminate the reg's list of eligible investment structures to
allow bank management flexibility to determine appropriate structures for
its investments.
        Also, the OCC adopted a final rule Dec. 27 allowing banks to
reinvest proceeds from these investments in any way they choose instead of
being required to reinvest in the community. o
Regulators Clarify
CRA Transition
        Federal banking regulators have clarified that once an institution
chooses or is forced to comply with the performance tests and standards of
the new CRA, it must comply with all of the requirements of the new rule.
(See Fed Register Dec. 20 and RCW Jan. 8 issue, p.2)
        The regulators gave this example: Small institutions will be
evaluated under the small bank performance standard beginning on Jan. 1,
1996. But for examiners to properly evaluate a bank, the institution must
also comply with other provisions of the new reg, including delineating an
assessment area, maintaining a public file and providing proper public
notice--requirements that don't under the transition rules, become
applicable until Jan. 1 or Jul 1, 1997.
        In another example, if a large bank elects to be evaluated under
the lending, investment and service tests before being required to do so in
July 1997, the bank would be required to comply on Jan. 1, 1996, with the
rule's other provisions.
        The regulators also intend to provide banks with guidance on CRA
strategic plans--the types of information to include and when and where to
file the plans--and how to qualify for wholesale bank status. OTS, for
example, plans to issue a CEO letter in the near future. o
Management Interlocks
Changes Proposed
        The financial institution regulatory agencies published a proposed
rule in the Federal Register Dec. 29 that revises their regulations on
management interlocks. Comments are due Feb. 27.
        In order to remove unnecessary obstacles faced by small banks
seeking to attract qualified management, the agencies propose to eliminate
the provision in the current rule that prohibits management interlocks
between an institution under $20 million in assets and a bank with assets
of $20 million or more that are both located in the same MSA. This change
is intended to provide small banks with a larger pool of qualified
candidates for management positions.
        The agencies aren't proposing any changes in the way the management
interlocks regulation is applied to banks in the same community, a smaller
geographic area than an MSA.

FANNIE SET TO BOOST LOAN LIMIT

Fannie Mae is on the verge of matching Freddie Mac's $4,150
conforming loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its
limit to $207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage
industry sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers to
raise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect
Jan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider the
views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make its
announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said those
details would be made available shortly.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not return
requests for comments.
        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie
raised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the last
month, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the
change in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew
that to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to
Freddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be
surprised."
