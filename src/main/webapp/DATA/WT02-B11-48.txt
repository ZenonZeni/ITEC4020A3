<b><p>
'Folkeoplysning' is a collective concept covering the teaching and pedagogically organized activities which do not form part of the formal education system established by the public authorities. 'Folkeoplysning' as a concept originates in the religious and social movements of the 19th century which were inspired by the Danish philosopher, poet, educationalist and clergyman N.F.S. Grundtvig.</b><p>

</ul><hr><p>
The initiative for the school forms mentioned here all originated in private initiatives from grassroot movements. Adult education (evening schools), associative life, 'folkehøjskoler' ("folk high schools") and 'daghøjskoler' (non-residential folkehøjskoler) are still private and self-governing even though they do receive considerable public funding. The offers of general qualifying education for adults have now been taken over and are supervised by the public authorities.<p>


<h3><a name="a">The act on 'Folkeoplysning' </a>(1991)
</h3>
Adult education, sports and youth associations, youth clubs and the university extra-mural department have been grouped in one act which provides the guidelines for the local authorities' allocation of financial
support to these activities. A local committee on Folkeoplysning draws up the more detailed regulations for the support so that it can be adapted to local conditions. The municipality is free to fix the total overall allocation, but it must allocate support to adult education and to activities for children and young people and to premises for sports and youth associations, clubs etc.
<p>
Approx. 1 million adults each year take part in adult education. The students pay one third of the expenses themselves, while the local authorities pay the rest: approx. 450 million DKK a year. Around two thirds of all children and young people take part in an association or in another form of organized activity which is almost solely run by voluntary unpaid staff. The public support allocated to this kind of activity is estimated to amount to approx. 800 million DKK, to which should be added approx. 1 billion for premises.
<p>
<h3><a name="b">'Folkehøjskoler' ("Folk High Schools")</a></h3>

Denmark has approx. 100 institutions of this kind, of which the oldest dates back to 1844 and the two youngest were established in 1991.
<p>
<b>Free schools </b><br>These schools are private schools organized as private foundations which decide on the content and form of the teaching themselves.
<p>


<b>Aims </b><br>The aims of these schools are expressed as follows in section 1 of the Act on 'Folkehøjskoler':
<p>
"The 'folkehøjskoler' shall offer adult students (over 18 years of age) general education and may within the framework of this give individual subjects or subject groups an important place". The concept of "general education" means that the the aim of the schools is personal development: By means of the teaching and the daily social dealings with other people, the students shall have the possibility of expanding their understanding of society and human relations.
<p>
As these schools do not hold any examinations or tests, the aim of the teaching becomes the personal growth, maturity and independence of the student.
<p>
<b>Establishment and approval</b><br> A 'folkehøjskole' is established by private initiators and can obtain public support when the Ministry of Education has approved 1) the statutes of the school, 2) the educational and administrative qualifications of the principal, 3) the suitability of the buildings for teaching and accomodation, as the 'folkehøjskole' is a boarding school where the students and often several of the teachers are living, and 4) the teaching plan, as emphasis is laid on the general educational aim.
<p>
<b>The teaching <br></b>As the individual school is free to arrange its own teaching, the offer of subjects is rather varying. Some schools focus on one individual subject-area, e.g. music, sports or arts and crafts. But the majority of

schools have a very varied offer of subjects which may comprise history, politics, literature, philosophy, cultural history or environmental issues.
<p>
<b>Courses and students<br></b> The 'folkehøjskole' offers long courses (of 5-32 weeks' duration) and short courses (of 1-4 weeks' duration). The average age of the students in the long courses is 22-23 years. In the short courses which in particular take place in the summer season, the age of the students is considerably higher. In 1990, there were a total of 13,500 students in the long courses and 44,000 in the short courses.
<p>
<b>Finance </b><br>The courses are financed partly by student fees, partly by government support. In 1989, the student fees and the government support contributed with equal parts of the income, i.e. a total of 85%. The schools received the remaining 15% by renting out the buildings for other purposes. The government furthermore allocates an incomedetermined grant towards the students' payment for their participation in courses of a minumum duration of 2 weeks.
<p>
In 1990, the government expenses for the schools and their students were as follows:
<p>
Grants to the schools: 361 million DKK. <br>Grants to the students: 106 million DKK.
<p>
<h3><a name="c">Non-residential 'folkehøjskoler'</a></h3>

These schools are institutions which offer 'folkeoplysning'. Their activities are particularly aimed at the unemployed.
<p>
The offer of the schools comprises a broad range of activities - with both cultural, social, creative and aesthetic aspects. The teaching covers both general and vocationally oriented topics.
<p>
In keeping with the close relation to the tradition of the 'folkehøjskole', the education offered by these schools lays a special emphasis on the strengthening of the personal development of the students and on the enhancement of their possibilities of taking part in the labour market or the education system.
<p>
The courses are normally of a duration of up to 16 weeks, but the schools also offer rather short introduction and guidance courses.
<p>
The experience gained so far shows that approx. two thirds of the students get a job or start on a course of education when they leave the course.
<p>
The non-residential 'folkehøjskoler' are formally private foundations. All schools (approx. 145) receive financial support from public authorities of approx. DKK 175 million for 4200 annual places corresponding to about 10,000 students.
<p>
It is possible for the students to receive social benefits (social security benefits, unemployment benefits etc.) during the course.
<p>
<h3><a name="d">Qualifying general education for adults</a></h3>

General adult education (AVU) is an offer of qualifying education which provides adults with a possibility of supplementing and updating their general education and of sitting for examinations at a level corresponding to the final form levels (9th-l0th forms) of the Folkeskole.
<p>
The subjects, curricula, the organization and examination forms are adapted to the needs and prerequisites of adults. The education provides general qualifications which can be used in connection with continued education in relation to working life or in social life.
<p>
<b>Finance</b> <br>The AVU is offered at the county adult education centres (the VUC). The county finances the education and supervises the teaching. There are about 75 adult education centres distributed all over the countr,v. The participation is free of charge - apart from a small registration fee.
<p>
<b>Range of subjects<br></b> The subject range consists of 7 core subjects which are offered at all centres: Danish, mathematics, English, German, French, natural sciences and social studies. In addition to these subjects, the following subjects may be offered: Danish as a foreign language, philosophy, history, informatics, Latin, typing with electronic wordprocessing, media knowledge and psycholog,v. It is furthermore possible to arrange interdisciplinary introduction courses and other subject offers of local interest. All subjects have a centrally determined or approved curriculum and are completed by a State-controlled examination for adults.
<p>
The subjects are offered on a single subject basis, and they are divided into modules. This enables the students to individually compose a course which corresponds to their

prerequisites and needs for qualifications.
<p>
Each subject module comprises between 80 and 120 lessons and is typically arranged over a period of 12-16 weeks. The individual adult education centre is however free to adapt the organization of the course on the basis of noted needs - also with a view to starting time and the time of examinations. The education is very flexible which also makes it possible for the course to cooperate with the other adult education courses such as the non-residential 'folkehøjskoler' and the labour market courses.
<p>
<b>Administration</b><br> At each adult education centre, there is a centre council which in cooperation with the management of the centre decides on the offer of subjects, the number of lessons in the individual subjects and other matters pertaining to the operation. The centre council consists of representatives from the local labour market parties, the municipal and county authorities as well as from the students and teachers of the centre.
<p>
<h3><a name="e">Adult educational support (VUS)</a></h3>

Act no. 336 of 24 May 1989 on adult educational support came into force on 1 October 1989. It is the aim of the act to create an economic basis which enables adults with a short education to take part in general and vocationally oriented education during working hours.
<p>
The student is free to choose an educational offer which fits his own needs, and the act gives equal importance to general and vocationally oriented edncation
<p>
Educational leave during working hours is agreed between the student and his employer.
<p>
The target group of the VUS is salaried employees, self-employed persons and assisting spouses between 25 and 60 years of age with a short school education and/or vocational training background. The prerequisite for receiving support is that the applicant has had at least 6 months of employment in his present workplace.
<p>
The educational support which is granted as a compensation for the loss of salary in connection with the participation in courses during working hours corresponds to the highest unemployment benefit which amounts to approx. 2,500 DKK per week. If the student is paid his ordinary salary during the course period, the amount of the educational support is refunded to the employer. VUS may be granted for teaching periods of 1-16 weeks' duration full time or correspondingly longer part-time teaching periods, but there must be a minimum number of 6 lessons per week.
<p>
Since 1989, financial support has been granted to a total of approx. 6,500 students.
