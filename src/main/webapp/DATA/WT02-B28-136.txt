<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> - A
Variable
Annuity From NYLIAC</STRONG></FONT><P>



Are you concerned you won't have enough money to finance the retirement you
want? 
Are you
worried
you'll outlive your income after you do retire?  With expenses, taxes, and
inflation eating
away at your
income, the amount of money you'll need for your future is certainly a moving
target.<P>
Merely saving isn't enough anymore.  To make your money go further, you need a
product that
can adapt to your long-term financial goals, one that gives you control over
your
funds and
the freedom
to change course when necessary.  And you need a product that gives you the
advantage of
proven
money management techniques yet still provides a measure of security. <P>
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> offers all this - and more. 
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> is a variable annuity that can
provide income
for your retirement.  Your earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis, which
may
help your
money
accumulate faster than it would in a similar but taxable investment.  With
LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> you
control how your money's invested.  And when you retire, you'll
control how you receive your money - LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>
can even
offer you income for the rest of your life.<P>
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> is issued by New York Life
Insurance
and
Annuity Corporation (NYLIAC), a wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life
Insurance
Company
and available through NYLIFE Securities Inc. (member NASD) 51 Madison Avenue, NY
NY
10010. 
<P>
<STRONG>Select From a Variety of Options</STRONG><BR>
Since no one understands your retirement goals better than you, you decide how
your
funds in
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> can be invested.  You can
allocate
your money
to stock, bond, balanced, international or money market accounts - or to the
Fixed
Account
that's fully
backed by assets in NYLIAC's general account.<P>
What's more, you're not locked into your choices.  When your lifestyle or
financial
goals
change, you can
change your mind - and your investment choices - simply by calling our toll-free
number.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP> 
<P>
<STRONG>Benefit From Professional Management</STRONG><BR>
Although you choose the investment accounts, you're certainly not on your own. 
The
professional fund
managers at MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation Financial Corporation, Monitor
Capital
Advisors, Inc., Calvert
Asset
Management Company, Inc., and New York Life manage the LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> portfolio accounts.  They are experienced financial
advisors with
proven
track records in investment management.
<P>
<STRONG>Control Your Premium Schedule</STRONG><BR>
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> offers an extremely flexible
premium
arrangement.  Initially, the minimum premium is $2,000 for tax-qualified plans,
or
$5,000 for
non-qualified plans.  You can then add to your annuity as you wish, with a
minimum
premium of
$500.
<P>
<STRONG>Earn Special Additional Interest Rate</STRONG><BR>
When you add new funds to the Fixed Account, a special interest rate will be
credited to that
money
during the first contract year.  After the first year, those funds will earn
renewal rates
set annually.
<P>
<STRONG>Keep In Touch</STRONG><BR>
With LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>, quality service is just a
phone call
away. 
Use our toll-free number to get information on your policy's cash value, to
transfer money
between
accounts, or to change the allocation of your future premium payments.  You'll
also
receive
quarterly
statements to keep you up-to-date on your policy.
<P>
<STRONG>The Power of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
Earnings in LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> accumulate
tax-deferred. 
In other
words, you don't pay taxes on earnings until you withdraw your money.  That
means
money may
accumulate faster than it would in a similar but currently taxable investment.
(Remember,
withdrawals
prior to age 591/2 may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.)
<P>
<STRONG>Control Your Taxes</STRONG><BR>
Here's another advantage of tax deferral:  since you aren't taxed on annuity
proceeds until
you withdraw
them, you can plan your withdrawals so you're not hit too hard by Uncle Sam. 
After
you
retire, you may
find yourself in a lower tax bracket - perhaps you can wait until then before
you
withdraw
your money.  Or
you can withdraw funds prudently, so you don't push yourself into a higher
bracket. 
An
annuity can offer
genuine tax control.  It can help your money accumulate - and last.
<P>
<STRONG>Select a Balance That's Right For You</STRONG><BR>
No two people have identical needs and concerns.  Depending on your life stage
and
your
financial
goals, you'll want to make sure you choose the investment mix that meets your
needs.  Perhaps
you're
younger and want to be more aggressive in your investment choices - you can
allocate your
money to
investment choices that offer the potential for higher return.  Later you may
prefer to
balance your
aggressive investments with those that offer a higher measure of safety.  And if
you're
nearing
retirement or have already retired, a more conservative allocation may suit your
goals
perfectly. 
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> allows you to change your
investment
strategy
as your needs change.
<P>
<STRONG>Set a Course</STRONG><BR>
Some people track their investment accounts daily - others set a course and let
it
run
itself. 
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> gives you those options.
<P>
<STRONG>Dollar Cost Averaging Option</STRONG><BR>
"Making money is easy," a wit said.  "You simply buy low and sell high."  But
how
can you
predict when
prices will be "low" or "high?"  You may not need to if you dollar cost average. 
With dollar
cost
averaging, you set up a program of scheduled investments - given dollar amounts
invested at
given
points in time - and stick to it, regardless of the changes in the markets. 
This
consistent,
disciplined
approach allows you to take advantage of market volatility by buying more
investment units
when prices
are low and fewer when prices are high.  Although dollar cost averaging does not
ensure a
profit nor
protect against a loss in a declining market, over time a sustained dollar cost
averaging
strategy can
reduce your timing risk and optimize your return. Investors should consider
their
financial
ability to continue purchases through periods of low and high price levels.<P>
<P>
<STRONG>Automatic Asset Reallocation Option</STRONG><BR>
Let's say you want to maintain a particular allocation of your assets in 
investment
divisions, for
example, 40% in Bond, 40% in Capital Appreciation and 20% in Cash Management. 
Since
portfolio
values change at different rates, you may need to move money between investment
divisions to
keep
your desired ratio.  It's a popular investment strategy, but it requires a lot
of
maintenance. 
<P>Fortunately, LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> offers an
Automatic
Asset
Reallocation feature that allows you to specify when - quarterly,
semi-annually,
or annually
- NYLIAC
will review your accounts and automatically make any necessary transfers to
bring
your
distribution
back into the balance you selected.
<P>
<STRONG>Payout at Retirement</STRONG><BR>
The goal of any annuity - including LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>
- is to
provide retirement income.  And with LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>, you can
elect to receive an income that's guaranteed to last as long as you live. And
although
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> is designed as a longer-term
investment, there
are other
ways to access your money without incurring surrender charges.<SUP><FONT
SIZE="-1"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></SUP> Withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may be
subject to a
10% IRS tax penalty.
<P>
<STRONG>Windows of Opportunity</STRONG><BR>
LifeStages' 10% Window allows immediate access
to
10% of your policy's cash value each year (less any surrender-charge-free
withdrawals you've
made
during the year) without triggering a surrender charge.<P>
In addition, LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> offers a Gain Window
for policies
with $100,000 or more in accumulated premium payments.  Without incurring
surrender
charges,
you
can withdraw the greater of all of the gain in your policy or the 10% Window
amount.
<P>
<STRONG>Loan Option for TSAs</STRONG><BR>
If you're investing through a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA) program only,
LifeStages offers liquidity through a TSA loan provision.  Loans may
equal the
lesser of 50% of the value of your policy or $50,000. 
<P>
<STRONG>Guaranteed Refund of Initial Premium on Fixed Account</STRONG><BR>
If you surrender your policy during the first three years, you're guaranteed to
receive the
portion of the
initial premium you allocated to, and that remained in, the Fixed Account. This
refund does
not apply if
any partial withdrawals are taken 
from the policy, such as the 10% Window or the Gain Window.
<P>
<STRONG>Guaranteed Advantages For Your Heirs</STRONG><BR>
To help you provide for your heirs, LifeStages<FONT
SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT>
offers a
death benefit equal to the greater of the cash value or the premiums paid less
withdrawals. 
In other
words, your heirs will receive at least the amount of money you've invested -
even
if your
accounts have
declined in value.<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#3">3</A></FONT></SUP>
<P>
There's even a three-year step-up<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A
HREF="#4">4</A></FONT></SUP> feature that offers even more protection.  Every
three
years,
your
death benefit "locks in" so your beneficiary is guaranteed the greater of the
current cash
value or
premiums paid less withdrawals or the cash value at each third-year anniversary
(plus any
premiums
paid less any withdrawals and surrender charges since the last third-year
anniversary).  This
enables
you to lock in new, higher levels of guarantees in a growing market. This
step-up
feature
continues until
the owner or annuitant reaches insurance age 85.
<P>

<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="1">1</A></FONT></SUP> Transfers
from
the
Fixed Account to Investment Divisions are subject to some restrictions.  See the
prospectus
for details. 
Subject to contract limitations, you are permitted twelve free transfers per
year. 
NYLIAC
reserves the
right to charge up to $30 for each transfer exceeding twelve per year.  This
offer
may be
modified or
withdrawn at any time.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="2">2</A></FONT></SUP>
LifeStages<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP>SM</SUP></FONT> surrender charges are based on
the
date of
each premium payment as follows:  7% in years one through three; 6% in year
four;
5% in year
five and
4% in year six. For residents of Oregon - after ten years, surrender charges
will
never be
more than 1%
of the policy cash value.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="3">3</A></FONT></SUP> Death
benefit
payments are dependent upon the claims-paying ability of NYLIAC.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1"><SUP><FONT SIZE="-1"><A NAME="4">4</A></FONT></SUP> For
residents
of
Texas, the step-up death benefit is "stepped up" every six years.</FONT>
