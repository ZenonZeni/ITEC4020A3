<A NAME="1."><H3>1. INTRODUCTION</H3></A>
<P>
During September 1992 through January 1993, a review team established
by the Department of Energy conducted an assessment of the U.S.
biomass power industry.  The review team, led by Michael Reed
of the Solar Thermal and Biomass Power Division, and consisting
of representatives of the Antares Group, Inc., and Meridian Corporation,
visited with more than 50 organizations representing all sectors
of the biomass power industry.  These organizations included utilities,
independent power producers (IPP), component manufacturers, engineering
and construction contractors, agricultural organizations, industrial
users, and regulatory organizations. 
<P>
<A NAME="1.1"><B>1.1 Assessment Objectives and Approach</B></A>
<P>
The "Biopower Tour" served many purposes.  First, DOE
solicited industry input for the development of the Biomass Power
Division's "Five Year Plan," which was issued in May
1993.  DOE believed there was a critical need to obtain industry's
insight and working knowledge to develop the near- and long-term
plans of the program.  At the heart of this objective was the
desire to identify near-term initiatives that the program could
pursue to help accelerate the further development of biomass power
projects.  Second, the tour was conducted to identify key players
of the U.S. biomass power industry and gain a better understanding
of its needs and goals.  Third, the tour served to inform industry
about the mission and scope of the DOE's Biomass Power Program.
 Many of the organizations were unaware that a biomass power program
existed within DOE.  As such, it was important to discuss with
industry the DOE mission, proposed DOE goals, and DOE willingness
to work with them in the future.
<P>
As discussed in Section 2, the biomass power industry will probably
never be a vertically integrated special industry (fuel supply,
equipment manufacture and installation, through project financing
and operation) like other renewable energy industries in wind,
photovoltaics, solar, and hydropower. As such, it was crucial
to identify the key players in this industry, and work with them
in identifying their needs.  DOE consulted with industry associations
and consultants to identify organizations that had active biomass
power projects and equipment in operation.  While the organizations
contacted cannot be considered all inclusive of the parties with
potential interest in biomass power, DOE obtained a good cross-section
of the industry. The geographic distribution of companies contacted
is shown in Exhibit 1-1.  In conducting the assessment, DOE presented a standard
presentation as a frame of reference for the meetings, but allowed
the discussions to focus on the issues and opportunities of most
importance to the industry representatives.  The basic intent
was to be a good listener and to try to identify trends and consensus
issues.
<P>
<A NAME="1.2"><B>1.2 Overview of Assessment Findings</B></A>
<P>
Biomass power already supplies 6 GWe of power to the domestic
grid and is the primary baseload technology among the renewables.
 Biomass power facilities have brought new industrial jobs to
rural areas of the country and spawned several new regional businesses
in biomass fuels procurement and delivery.  The basic technology
for producing power is proven for selected feedstocks in plant
sizes ranging from 10 to 50 MWe.  However, many plants that have
been fueled by agricultural byproducts or low-grade wood fuels
have experienced operational problems.  Fuel sources are currently
limited to forest thinning materials, wood and agriculture industry
byproducts, or biomass in urban waste streams.  The industry must
generally rely on short term contracts or the spot market for
fuel purchases.  The infrastructure for fuel production, collection,
and transport is still in a nascent state.
<P>
Despite rapid growth in the 1980s, the numbers of active biomass
power projects decreased in the 1990s.  There are several reasons
for the lack of current project activity.  Power producers have
often had to use a good deal of ingenuity in their ability to
acquire sufficient fuel feedstocks at reasonable costs.  Competition
for a limited feedstock source can drive up the price of the fuel
substantially and limits the number of projects within a geographic
region.  In addition, use of feedstocks with characteristics that
differ substantially from the fuel for which a given boiler was
designed affects both unit performance and reliability.
<P>
The competition from natural gas-fired generators has also dampened
the market for biomass and many other fossil-fueled projects.
 End-use natural gas prices peaked in the 1980s and have generally
declined since then.  The magnitude of the change varies by end-use
sector, with prices declining most for on-system industrial sales
and for electric utilities.  The price of power generated by natural
gas combustion turbines has also often been the basis for the
price for avoided costs on which most Independent Power Producers'
(IPP) power contracts are based.   While production and availability
of natural gas is expected to be maintained if not expanded throughout
the 1990s, prices have risen since 1991.
<P>
Despite the current downturn in the market, members of the IPP
industry believe that if the environmental benefits of biomass
power are fully recognized through externalities and if natural
gas prices once again return to prices consistent with the history
of natural gas as a premium fuel, then the market will rebound.
 The utility industry, which until now has been a relatively small
player in the development of biomass projects, is poised to become
a significant interest through cofiring wood at existing coal-fired
boilers.  This approach will allow them to reap the significant
environmental benefits associated with biomass.  For the near
term, the IPP industry will survive by continuing to improve operations
at current plants and exploiting niche markets for greenfield
power plants.  Although most project developers expressed interest
in the international markets, where capacity growth projections
are impressive, there was a practical appreciation of the difficulties
of developing projects based on new technology or new fuel sources
for that market.
<P>
Although many differing views were expressed concerning what needs
to be accomplished and what role DOE should take to bring about
a "green revolution" in power production, there was
consensus on the major issues and opportunities:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Information and Education:</B>  A high visibility information
dissemination campaign needs to be undertaken to correct the most
commonly held misconceptions about modern biomass-fired power
facilities and to provide the public and decision makers with
a well-founded understanding of the environmental and economic
benefits of utilizing biomass resources for power generation.
<P>
<LI><B>Environmental Assessment and Valuation:</B>  Biomass could
have the high tech image of photovoltaic power systems, but it
will never be a zero-emissions-generating technology.  Its environmental
characteristics (both positive and negative) must be accurately
characterized and fairly portrayed to the public.  Environmental
characterizations should be performed by independent industry
sources.  The environmental benefits must be valued in decision
making with respect to power resource choices.  Methods to properly
value external benefits are still in a developmental stage. 
<P>
<LI><B>EPACT 1992 Implementation:</B>  The incentives provided
in Sections 1212 and 1914 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (renewable
energy production incentive and renewable electricity production
tax credit) could be important stimuli to biomass power project
development, particularly for encouraging consideration of investments
in sustainable dedicated fuel supply systems.  Latitude in qualifying
facilities for the incentives is needed to ensure transitional
types of projects can be undertaken (i.e., cofiring).
<P>
<LI><B>Developing Cofiring Opportunities:</B>  Cofiring biomass
with coal represents the best near-term opportunity to increase
use of biomass fuels among utilities and quickly bring on line
biomass-fired generation capacity.  The merits of this fuel switch
option will have to be demonstrated at utility generating stations
for several types of boilers to encourage widespread acceptance.
<P>
<LI><B>Expanding the Resource Base:</B>  One general area of
need and opportunity will be projects and activities that expand
the current resource base available to power producers.  Nearly
all of the industry representatives for IPPs and utilities expressed
the desire to be able to use a wider base of fuel resources economically.
 It was very clear from the meetings that the achieved survival
of a nascent biomass power industry would depend on expanding
the availability of diverse low-cost fuel sources.
<P>
<LI><B>Develop Repowering Opportunities:</B>  Many of the generating
units built by IPPs were constructed when available resources
were cheaper and purchased-power agreements were generous.  As
such, combustion efficiency was not considered a major issue at
that time.  As power purchase agreements expire and new contracts
are negotiated, the ability of many of these facilities to continue
to be productive will be in question.  Repowering projects could
improve the efficiency and availability of some of these plants
to extend their useful life until a new generation of conversion
systems becomes commercially available.  Repowering aging utility-owned
coal- and oil-fired plants to efficiently produce power from biomass
is also a potential area for project development.
<P>
<LI><B>Develop Products for International and Modular Prepackaged
Generation Markets:</B> For international markets in areas where
power is frequently needed in smaller increments and biomass resources
are plentiful, small-scale packaged biomass generators will be
very attractive.  On a larger scale, several companies have targeted
the existing agricultural processing industry as potential power
producers.  To open this market, new U.S. products will have to
be demonstrated to meet performance (including cost), maintainability,
and reliability claims of the manufacturers.
</UL>
<P>
The power generation industry remains interested in the potential
for biomass power, but sees fewer opportunities to develop profitable
greenfield projects under current market conditions.  However,
the experience gained in the 1980s is providing a solid base for
developing successful projects in the 1990s for niche markets.
 Cofiring and repowering projects are expected to provide the
best opportunities for continued near-term growth in the use of
biomass fuels. 
<P>
As will be reported on the following pages, the current industry
faces many hurdles and obstacles.  The problems identified by
the survey team, and the potential role that the DOE Biomass Power
Program can fill to alleviate these problems, will be outlined.
 However, it must be remembered that input was received from numerous
organizations representing a diverse range of opinion. As such,
this report should be viewed as DOE's analysis of the collective
discussions held with industry.
<P>
<A NAME="2."><H3>2. INDUSTRY STRUCTURE & KEY PLAYERS</H3></A>
<P>
<A NAME=2.1><B>2.1 Overview</B></A>
<P>
The biomass power industry will probably never be a vertically
integrated specialty industry, unlike renewable energy industries
in wind, photovoltaics, and low-head hydropower.  The IPPs, utilities,
and engineering and construction (E&C) firms that implement
the technology are unlikely to dedicate all of their resources
to a single fuel or technology, although they will often commit
to a small group of technologies that are competitive in the power
market.  Despite the significant differences that the fuel characteristics
of biomass impose on combustion and conversion technology, boiler
and gasifier manufacturers will offer products that span the fuel
market rather than focus on a dedicated fuel capability.  As a
result, biomass power will be a subset of the power industry with
constituents in each of its major segments.  On the fuel side,
the agricultural interests are likely to present a similar picture
with only a few growers dedicating their total resources to a
single crop.  The constituents for biomass power are likely to
be organizations who see a profitable future for this generation
resource and who have technology that is adaptable to the resource
or project development experience that could give them a competitive
advantage.  In some cases, individual players may make an exclusive
commitment to the biomass option, but they will probably be the
exception rather than the rule.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2"><B>2.2 Components of the Industry</B></A>
<P>
The components of the biomass power industry are depicted in Exhibit 2-1 and include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Regulated Electric Utilities<BR>
<LI>Independent Power Producers (IPPs)<BR>
<LI>Utility/Industrial Component Manufacturers<BR>
<LI>Engineering and Construction (E&C) Contractors<BR>
<LI>Agricultural Organizations<BR>
<LI>Industrial Users/Producers<BR>
<LI>Regulatory Organizations<BR>
<LI>Feedstock/Fuel Brokers
</UL>
<P>
Organizations in each of the above groups are likely to play a
key role in the success or failure of biomass power both domestically
and abroad.  Shown as a second tier player in the diagram are
the investment institutions/organizations that will be called
upon to finance power projects.  The importance of these organizations
to the acceptance and development of biomass as a power resource
is such that they can be considered on a par with the first tier
players in the decision making for power projects.  Included in
that category of interests are the insurance firms that provide
efficacy insurance for projects.  Without such insurance many
projects would be too risky for investors to underwrite.  The
interests of these groups in the technology are discussed in the
sections that follow (and the following Exhibit  2-2), concluding with an evaluation of the role they are likely to play in the development of the resource and implementation
of improved technology in future biomass power stations in the
U.S. and abroad. 
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.1"><B>2.2.1 Electric Utilities</B></A>
<P>
A handful of utilities have built biomass power stations.  These
are mostly smaller utilities such as municipalities, and the stations
are more often multi-fueled facilities rather than dedicated units.
<P>
The utilities are important constituents of the industry because
they represent mainstream users of the technology for bulk power
production at a utility scale.  In addition, many utilities have
experimented or continue to experiment with cofiring wood, municipal
solid waste, and coal.  Their primary interests in the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE) Biomass R&D program will be the improvement
of the current technologies or the demonstration of the next generation
of technology.  Regulated utilities are required to provide customers
with safe, reliable, and economic service while earning an agreed
upon return on investment.  For biomass power, one of the issues
is the impact on the cost of delivery of economical power from
a resource that is often not located near electric load centers.
 Since wheeling of power through systems at reasonably high efficiencies
is an increasingly  available option to generators, the concern
is more one of access to transmission systems with available capacity.
 Utilities are more likely to support a biopower demonstration
if either can be accomplished through a relatively low capital
retrofit of existing facilities, providing efficiency and reliability
improvements.  A major concern for such retrofits will be the
effect on current permits for the facility.  A review of current
permits triggered by a possible demonstration of new technology
would be a significant risk for the plant owners.
<P>
The utilities are not a homogeneous group, and the subgroups within
the industry have different needs and resources.  The major subgroups
are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Investor Owned Utilities (IOU)<BR>
<LI>Municipal Utilities<BR>
<LI>Rural Electric Cooperatives<BR>
<LI>Federal Power Authorities
</UL>
<P>
Among these groups, the most active players in biomass projects
are the municipal utilities.  Few of the large investor-owned
utilities (IOUs) yet own biomass-fired facilities, but many are
power purchasers from the IPPs.  This may change as the scale
of biomass power projects increases.  None of the rural cooperative
generators or the Federal Power Authorities have built biomass
power stations.  The capacity growth needs of the smaller IOUs,
the rural electric cooperatives, and the municipal utilities are
well suited to the size of current biomass power facilities. 
However, when larger plants based on dedicated fuel supply systems
(DFSS) and advanced conversion cycles are ready for demonstration
at full scale, the larger IOUs are likely to be the power purchasers
and/or project developers.
<P>
Another possible DOE Biomass Program constituent is the coal-fired
utilities for whom biomass cofiring might represent an attractive
Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) compliance option.  The Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA) has inaugurated a program of assessment
and evaluation for these purposes in cooperation with DOE and
the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).  In addition, a
set of utilities for which biomass cofiring appears to have merit
was identified in a recent report prepared by Scott Piscitello
and Christian Demeter of Antares for National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) entitled 'Biomass Cofiring Analysis Summary.'
<P>
In summary, the utilities and their research, development, testing,
and evaluation arm, EPRI, are an important constituent of the
program.  The utilities' interest in the program is likely to
be in near-term technical improvements to the technology.  They
offer the potential for joint venture (cost-shared) retrofit demonstrations.
 They are also the ultimate customer for biomass power technology.
 Whether they build and operate their own plants or purchase power
from the IPPs, they will be key decision makers with regard to
technology acceptance and implementation.  In some ways, they
may be considered to have less at stake than other constituents
since their investment is limited to the facilities they operate.
 Many of these facilities could be converted to other fuels if
economics and other factors indicate it would be prudent to do
so.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.2"><B>2.2.2 Independent Power Producers</B></A>
<P>
A second key constituent for the biomass power industry is the
IPPs.  The IPPs are similar to the electric utility in that they
will serve as project developers for the industry.  Also, there
are IPPs who already own and operate biomass-fired power plants.
 Along with cogenerators, the IPPs represent the major portion
of today's biomass generation capacity.  Included in this category
are JWP Energy Products, Thermo Electron, HYDRA-CO, and Wheelabrator
(Exhibit 2-4).  The independent power project developer segment
is the most diversified in terms of the organizations involved,
ranging from the specialists-companies created solely to develop
for this market-to the many subsidiary companies of the utilities,
E&C contractors, and equipment vendors vying for a piece of
the market.  Many of the subsidiaries operate with a large degree
of independence under the parent organization and are subject
to the same market factors and interests driving the specialists
in the industry.
<P>
Under Title IV of CAAA, independently owned generating plants
with capacities of 25 MW or more will be held to the same sulfur
dioxide (SO2) emission limits as electric utility plants.  However,
emission allowances will not be given to the IPPs (as is the case
with the utilities) and will have to be purchased on the open
market or at emission allowance auctions.  Therefore, IPPs' interest
in the virtually sulfur-free biomass resource should increase
as the regulation's deadline nears (January 1, 2000).
<P>
IPPs are well suited to respond to the utilities' current disposition
towards smaller capacity additions that require modest capital
outlays.  The Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA),
which mandates electric utilities to buy power from independent
producers using renewable sources or cogeneration, sets an upper
limit of 80 MW on the producer's capacity.  This size fits the
capacity addition range needed by many utilities.  This range
also matches the capacities of installed biomass power facilities.
 Thus, there often is a match between the size of plants that
will be constructed by IPPs operating under PURPA, the capacity
additions which the utilities desire, and the size associated
with current biomass resources.  The competitive bid process being
utilized in many states for resource acquisitions is beginning
to affect this market to some degree, increasing the size of many
recent IPP projects.  Scale-up of biomass technology will be more
important as this trend continues.
<P>
Biomass can also be used to cogenerate electricity with process
heat (steam).  This creates opportunities for IPPs to work with
industrial participants (such as the pulp and paper industry or
the wood products industry) who can supply the biomass resource
and also offer a host for the process heat.  An interesting market
for biomass-based cogeneration may be industrial participants
who currently operate natural gas/gas turbine technology.  For
example, the Boise Cascade pulp and paper plant in Fort Francis,
Ontario currently operates an 86-MW natural gas-fired combined
cycle unit.  Biomass gasifiers could be installed at such locations
and coupled to the existing combustion turbines.  
<P>
Underlying the success of the IPP industry is the advantage of
operating under less regulatory burden than the electric utilities.
 Therefore, the IPP is less constrained in their generating technology
options and have a greater ability to take risks and earn healthy
rates of return.  In contrast to regulated utilities, the IPPs
are dependent upon the capital investment markets for project
financing.  More recently, these investors are requiring greater
financial exposure of the developers and other participants in
the projects to ensure their interests in protecting the investment.
 This tends to result in a greater degree of conservatism in site,
resource, and  technology choices for new projects.  This is exemplified
by the current emphasis on natural gas combustion turbine projects.
 For the IPPs to be successful, they will need to work with utilities
to identify locations for projects that can tap into existing
transmission and distribution capabilities and that are near areas
of increasing electric power demand. 
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.3"><B>2.2.3 Utility and Industrial Power Component Manufacturers</B></A>
<P>
The traditional suppliers of utility power generation hardware
are large, well-financed, heavy equipment manufacturers.  Nearly
all have international operations and compete in a global market.
 All of these companies also have product lines and services aimed
at the industrial power market.  In the industrial market, there
are smaller specialty companies who also serve the market.  Some
of these firms, such as JWP Energy Products, may dedicate their
product line to biomass and municipal solid waste (MSW); however,
these firms are the exception.  Nevertheless, the equipment vendors
are important biomass program constituents because they are the
most likely participants in hardware R&D, with a stake in
the advancement of the state of the art.  Pictured in Exhibit  2-5 is an Ahlstrom/Pyropower biomass-fired fluidized bed unit.  Both bubbling and circulating fluidized bed boilers are representative
of state-of-the-art utility boilers capable of handling a wide
variety of biomass fuels.
<P>
Among the larger vendors, there are sufficient resources to support,
through cost-sharing, the DOE R&D program if the corporate
commitment exists.  Those companies that have invested in the
coal gasification option may be inclined to make a serious commitment
to the biomass gasification alternative if they see a strong potential
market and view the biomass conversion option as a hedge on their
investment in developing coal conversion equipment.  For this
reason, the companies involved in coal gasification should be
viewed as potential partners in the biomass power program.  A
similar argument can be made for the manufacturers of hot gas
cleanup equipment.  
<P>
In contrast, the gas turbine manufacturers are less likely to
commit resources to develop a new turbine tailored to biomass
derived fuels.  Manufacturers of turbo-machinery designed for
the low-Btu gases supplied by coal will likely already have a
product for the biomass gasification process.  However, the fuel
of choice for the foreseeable future is natural gas, and motivation
to invest in alternative fueled turbine development is nil.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.4"><B>2.2.4 Engineering and Construction Contractors</B></A>
<P>
Often power equipment manufacturers, such as General Electric,
Westinghouse, and ABB Combustion Engineering, take on the role
of E&C contractor.  In other situations, companies are dedicated
to E&C and are not involved with component manufacturing (e.g.,
Black & Veatch, Stone & Webster).  In either circumstance,
electric utilities and IPPs rely on E&C contractors for large
tasks that may be beyond the responsibilities they wish to bear.
 For this reason, the E&C firms must be kept abreast of, and
involved with, the Biomass Power Program.  The most important
of these firms' capabilities is turnkey services, in which they
are responsible for coordination of feasibility, design, procurement,
construction, start-up, and operation.  Some of these firms even
assist in financing.  Often the contractor can supply some or
all of these individual services in addition to the coordination.
 Due to the similarities between biomass power technologies and
more traditional technologies (e.g., biomass IGCC/coal IGCC similarities),
E&C contractors can easily make the transition to the biomass
power industry.  In fact, several manufacturers, including Babcock
& Wilcox and Foster Wheeler, have already provided turnkey
services at biomass-fired facilities, generally for the pulp and
paper and sugar processing industries.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.5"><B>2.2.5 Industrial Users and Cogenerators</B></A>
<P>
The wood products industry and pulp and paper mills have used
biomass fuels on a broad scale for process heat and self generation.
 PURPA brought in a new set of players building biomass-fired
cogeneration systems supplying industry with process steam and
electricity, and also feeding power back to the grid as a qualifying
facility.  However, the primary objective of the mills is to dispose
of the unused byproducts; heat and power generation are generally
secondary benefits.  With the trend in the industry toward waste
minimization and alternative uses for unused byproducts of higher
value than fuels, the availability of these sources will tend
to decrease in the future.  For the cogeneration project developers,
the number of attractive sites with hosts for process steam have
dwindled.
<P>
Currently the wood products industry is the primary supply source
for biomass fuels for power projects.  That role is expected to
continue throughout the 1990s.  The importance of this group to
the development of biomass power is probably its knowledge of
large scale feedstock production, transportation, processing and
handling systems, and its holdings or rights to large areas of
potential feedstock production,  which might give it a competitive
advantage in entering the production phase of the business.  Nearly
all of the major businesses involved in the wood and paper products
industry have had power generation experience including Georgia-Pacific,
Boise-Cascade, and Weyerhaeuser.
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.6"><B>2.2.6 Biomass Fuels and Fuel Feedstocks</B></A>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has ongoing programs
that are looking at specialty crops for biomass fuel production;
for example, rapid growth poplars and switch grass, and has signed
a Memorandum of Understanding with DOE to pursue these programs
jointly.  Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has a current project
focused on the development of a biomass fuels model that can project
resource availability based on plant type, soil characteristics,
water availability, climate, and other characteristics.  However,
from a less technical viewpoint, what also needs to be investigated
is to what extent current agricultural subsidies and allowances
will enhance or slow the transition by the agricultural sector
to biomass fuel crops.  It may be appropriate to look in detail
at the economics of biomass fuels production to insure the resource
availability at a cost-competitive price.  The analysis should
consider the environmental costs as well as the national/regional
economic benefit of relying on a domestically produced fuel. 
These economic benefits would include an increase in jobs, reduction
in energy imports, and an increase in federal, state, and local
tax revenues. 
<P>
<A NAME="2.2.7"><B>2.2.7 Regulatory Agencies</B></A>
<P>
The decisions of the regulatory agencies affect nearly all aspects
of power production and can be pivotal in the development of the
biomass power industry.  A favorable view toward the environmental
and economic benefits of biomass power could lead to changes in
the competitive bidding process and integrated resource planning
(IRP) being instituted in most states in the U.S. and potentially
in foreign jurisdictions as well that might give biomass a competitive
advantage.  Equally, an unfavorable ruling on biomass environmental
impacts could hurt biomass projects across the board-permitting,
competitive bidding, cost of construction and operation, and generation
efficiency.  Generally, regulatory agencies will not champion
technology or resources, but they certainly have the power to
influence resource choices by penalizing the perceived negative
impacts of specific resource and technology choices.  From this
standpoint, DOE cannot afford to ignore the information needs
and technical concerns of the regulatory bodies.  In effect this
may be an important way in which the Biomass Power Program can
assist industry toward near-term implementation of biomass projects.
 The degree of objectivity shown by DOE in presenting its lab
and field test findings with respect to biomass power technology
will have a profound affect on their acceptance by the regulators.
 A number of regulatory agencies at the national (EPA) and local
(e.g. South Coast Air Quality Management District, CA) level have
R&D resources for evaluation of environmental characteristics
of new energy technologies and could be contributing partners
in the Biomass Power Program.  A number of the PUCs nationwide
have been or are in the process of commissioning analytical studies
of the use of environmental adders (externalities) in the resource
selection process and other important refinements to the IRP process.
<P>
<A NAME="3."><H3>3. DYNAMICS OF THE MARKETPLACE</H3></A>
<P>
The marketplace for biomass power projects is influenced by many
factors. Some of these factors, such as the low cost of natural gas in
the past several years, make it difficult for the biomass power
option (and many other conventional or renewable fuels) to compete
on a simple production cost bid basis. Other influencing factors,
such as negative public perception, can be overcome with increased
information dissemination.  Meetings with industry representatives
focused on the following issues as being the areas of greatest
challenge.
<P>
<A NAME="3.1"><B>3.1 Cost of Electricity</B></A>
<P>
Biomass power projects are relatively capital intensive (comparable
to coal, but less than nuclear) and must generally be operated
as baseload stations to make the investment economic.  The busbar
cost-of-electricity (COE) is a common figure of merit used to
compare generation alternatives.  A high capacity factor reduces
the impact of the capital cost component of the plant COE.  This
increases the relative importance of fuel and other operating
costs as components of COE.  Once a project is operational, the
plant will be dispatched solely on its relative cost to operate
compared to other plants in the system.  Thus, for a biomass power
project to contribute value to the utility system, operating costs
must be competitive with other choices.  The primary drivers for
operating costs are station heat rate and fuel cost with low heat
rate and fuel cost being the winning combination.  (IPPs generally
have contracts requiring the utilities to buy as much electricity
as the IPP can produce, but the price paid for power is fixed.
 Thus, the IPP has a similar motivation to minimize fuel costs
and heat rate, though it is driven more by profitability than
dispatchability.) 
<P>
<A NAME="3.1.1"><B>3.1.1 Low Cost Power Generation Options</B></A>
<P>
Natural gas prices have remained relatively low in recent years,
while natural gas combined cycle plants have increased the efficiency
of power production dramatically.  This price moderation for what
is usually viewed as a premium fuel has allowed electricity generation
costs to approach 4&#162;/kWh with this fuel source.  Although
more regional in nature (i.e. in the northwest U.S.), low-head
hydropower costs are in this range as well.  Relicensing issues
surrounding existing hydro sites are expected to significantly
constrain the use of this resource. Because the natural gas option
is widely available, it has become the standard for many utilities
in setting a floor on resource bids. More recently, gas prices
have begun to rebound and will probably escalate at a moderate
level during the rest of the decade.
<P>
<A NAME="3.1.2"><B>3.1.2 Feedstock Availability and Cost</B></A>
<P>
Feedstock availability and cost strongly influence the COE associated
with biomass power facilities.  Biomass feedstock collection can
be labor intensive, especially when obtained from the forest floor.
 Also, because biomass has a higher bulk density per unit heat
input than coal, it has higher associated transportation and handling
costs.  In the northwest, environmental concerns (i.e. spotted
owl habitat) have greatly affected the timber industry.  This
directly affects the feedstock availability for biomass power
plants in that region.  In California, the rapid development of
biomass power facilities in the 1980s (as a result of PURPA legislation),
created a high demand, causing biomass fuel prices to skyrocket.
 Furthermore, as pulp and paper mill operations become more efficient,
there is less byproduct resource available.  Competing end-uses
for biomass resources, such as for landscaping mulch, maintain
demand-side pressure.  
<P>
Countering those forces to some degree are trends such as the
restrictions on landfilling that may increase the availability
of process byproduct resources in the market. As electricity prices
increase, pulp and paper mills will want to become more self-sufficient
in power, and repowering with high-efficiency biomass-fueled power
systems will be more desirable.
<P>
<A NAME="3.2"><B>3.2 Financing/Lending Institutions</B></A>
<P>
Another obstacle encountered in the today's markets for new power
is securing financing.  Securing financing for biomass projects
can be more difficult than for conventional projects due to higher
perceived risks.  For all IPP projects, the recent trend of requiring
a higher equity stake on the part of the developer is forcing
technology toward the tried and true. Lending institutions are
very reluctant to finance the construction of biomass power plants
without an established long-term fuel supply infrastructure. A
power plant will not be financed without a fuel supply infrastructure,
and the fuel supply infrastructure will not be created without
a market for the biomass fuel.  In addition, despite the need
for the use of higher efficiency conversion systems to make biomass
power fuels competitive, most lenders are uncomfortable with new
or unfamiliar power generation technology. Thus, perceived risks
in financing can be a significant hurdle to the introduction of
the technology that is needed to move the industry forward.  
<P>
<A NAME="3.3"><B>3.3 Environmental and Permitting Regulations</B></A>
<P>
A recurring concern echoed throughout the industry is dealing
with variable and changing permitting requirements.  Federal,
state, and local regulations present a veritable maze to the biomass
plant developer, Exhibit 3-2.  In addition, biomass power is seen
as a relatively new technology concept where many regulators are
concerned.  Therefore, whenever a developer is applying for permits
for a biomass plant, he must first educate the appropriate regulators
concerning biomass technology.  This has the practical effect
of sending the permitting process back to square one for every
new biomass plant, where each aspect of the plant must be documented
and/or proven, over and over again.  This approach may also be
seen as unnecessarily burdensome, given the potentially beneficial
environmental aspects of biomass power compared to some conventional
plants.  It is hoped that once regulators are educated as to the
benefits of biomass power, some of this repetition could certainly
be eliminated (placing biomass on at least an equal footing with
conventional power sources), and perhaps even some informal streamlining
could take place.  An example presented to the survey team indicated
that the permitting process for a new plant took three years and
cost $3 million.  Streamlining the permitting process would be
a logical step for organizations hoping to encourage the use of
biomass power.
<P>
<A NAME="3.4"><B>3.4 Power Purchase Agreements and Externality Considerations</B></A>
<P>
Competitive bidding practices pit IPP generation options against
each other and utility-financed options.  This practice is gradually
replacing the avoided-cost power contract.  On a simple first
cost basis, gas combustion turbines tend to have a clear advantage.
 However, some jurisdictions are beginning to value externalities
such as environmental and economic impacts in the competitive
bid process.  These factors tend to level the playing field for
biomass power and other alternatives.  In bids where these factors
have been given significant weight, biomass power projects have
proven to be competitive.  Exhibit 3-3 indicates the potential effect of several externalities
as they might be applied to a cofiring retrofit project for an
existing coal-fired facility.  While the trend is toward giving
these considerations more weight, the process and methods are
still controversial and far from being widely used.  One approach
favored by several states has been the use of set-asides of blocks
of power for acquisition of renewables.  This approach lets renewables
compete among themselves and avoids the use of a complex system
of cost adders in the bid process.
<P>
In February 1993 the administration proposed a broad-based
energy tax covering fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and hydroelectric
power.  'Non-conventional' fuels, including biomass,
were excluded.  The Administration stated the objectives of the
tax were to increase energy efficiency, improve the environment,
enhance national security, and strengthen domestic economic performance.
 The tax was to be indexed to the energy content of the fuels
and was proposed at 25.7&#162;/MMBtu.  Although it is unlikely
that the conference committee bill will include the Btu tax in
this form, it is expected that the trend toward valuing externalities
in tax measures will be an approach given serious consideration
by legislators.
<P>
<A NAME="3.5"><B>3.5 Public Perception</B></A>
<P>
It appears that as a whole, the biomass power industry suffers
from a public relations problem.  Much of the general public (and
to some extent the regulatory community) views biomass combustion
as an old (1930s) style combustion technology or, worse, as a
cover for waste incineration.  Environmental and economic benefits
of the technology are not often taken into account.  Public awareness
about today's biomass power generation, on a national level, is
essentially nonexistent.  This lack of awareness and/or  misconception
about biomass power often causes unfounded community concerns
regarding the siting of biomass power facilities.  
<P>
Industry perceives a further complication of this problem by the
government's failure to take a firm stance with regard to developing
biomass as a national resource for its economic and environmental
benefits in power generation. Industry lacks the independence
to evaluate and promote these benefits to the public.  Thus, the
burden of reaching the public on the need for biomass power falls
to DOE which, in conjunction with the USDA and EPA, must present
a united or at least coordinated front on the issues to be resolved
and benefits that can be achieved through promoting biopower.
<P>
<A NAME="4."><H3>4.  OPPORTUNITIES</H3></A>
<P>
As a result of the assessment team's discussions,
a number of important opportunities for coordinated efforts and
possible joint ventures between DOE and industry were apparent.
 Each of these areas can produce important near term results that
will spur the continued development of the biomass resource and
generation capacity in the 1990s.  These opportunities received
strong consideration in the development of the DOE Five-Year Plan.
<P>
<A NAME="4.1"><B>4.1Cofiring Biomass and Coal in Utility Boilers</B></A>
<P>
Cofiring alternative fuels, such as biomass and coal (or other fossil fuels), has been
conducted on an experimental basis by utilities without much fanfare
throughout the U.S. (See Exhibit 4-1) Experience
varied with boiler configuration.  In pulverized coal boilers,
cofiring has been limited to a few percent of heat input.  In
coal stokers, the percentage cofiring has been increased into
the 25% to 50% range, while fluidized bed boilers have been fired
with mixtures that span the full range.
<P>
 Cofiring, as a strategy
element of the Biomass Power Program, provides one of the best
opportunities to quickly bring the utilities into the fold of
biomass resource users.  IPPs that build or own coal-fired stations
may also be interested.  From the utility point of view, cofiring
is attractive for several reasons.  Cofiring of inexpensive byproduct
fuels solves two problems.  It helps  mitigate a waste wood disposal
problem that is becoming increasingly burdensome for industrial
customers, municipalities, and citizens.  As landfill restrictions
are tightened and operating costs spiral upward, the diversion
of waste wood from landfills to the power generator as a low/no-cost
fuel resource can provide direct consumer benefits.  Not only
is landfill space preserved, but consumer waste disposal costs
and customer power rates may be lowered.  If the byproduct fuels
can be procured at a near zero cost, it may provide the only opportunity
to revitalize some smaller capacity coal units that are no longer
economical to dispatch as base or intermediate load plants.  Cofiring
is also a low-risk, low-capital cost option.  This makes it a
much easier sell to both utility management and the Public Utilities
Commission.  Other cogent factors favoring cofiring from the utility
perspective include: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Direct environmental benefits of both
reduced air emissions (lower SOx, NOx, and CO2 emissions) and
reduced solid waste streams.  Thus, biomass provides power while
demonstrating corporate commitment to a cleaner environment.
<P>
<LI>Possible economic benefits accruing to SO2 allowances and avoidance
of potential carbon taxes.
<P>
<LI>Fewer permitting problems by introducing
this 'new' fuel on a partial basis at existing permitted
facilities.
<P>
<LI>Fuel flexibility providing negotiating advantages
in fuel procurement for coal and biomass.
</UL>
<P>
From the DOE perspective
several factors make this strategy attractive:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>This strategy
element is also a low risk to DOE on both the investment and technical
ends.
<P>
<LI>Cofiring offers the best near-term opportunity to bring
the traditional utility companies into the biomass power arena
providing them with fuel procurement, permitting, and operational
experience.
<P>
<LI>Environmental regulators and the public are afforded
the opportunity to evaluate the use of biomass fuels in a permitting
setting that is far less threatening.
<P>
<LI>Cofiring is a technology
choice that can deliver its share of the power generation capacity
goal set for the biomass power program in SOLAR 2000.
<P>
<LI>Cofiring can provide the lower risk transition step to DFSS development.
</UL>
<P>
Only
two utilities have cofired coal and biomass on a continuous basis.
 These are Tacoma Public Utilities and Northern States Power.
 Burlington's McNeil plant was designed to operate solely on wood
fuel but was later converted to cofire natural gas (at low summer
rates) and biomass to improve plant economics and dispatchability.
<P>
In
the Southeast and mid-Atlantic region, several utilities have
experimented with cofiring biomass and coal in existing utility
boilers.  Santee Cooper has successfully fired a 5% mix of biomass
and coal on a temporary basis.  Others, including Delmarva and
Carolina Power and Light, have run wood/coal cofiring tests. 
TVA is undertaking a year long study of retrofit options for its
coal-fired power stations as well as resource assessments.  Early
results indicate that there are units that could be adapted for
pulverized wood firing with minimal impacts on boiler operation.
 The Southern Company is in the midst of a similar assessment
and is already cofiring wood and paper processing byproducts on
a limited basis at several facilities in the system.  In fact,
the Southern Company affiliated utilities have expressed a desire
to implement pilot plant conversions at several smaller stations
in the system.
<P>
In the Northeast, Niagara Mohawk is investigating
opportunities to cofire a number of alternative fuels in its coal-fired
facilities primarily to take advantage of very low cost byproduct
fuels to improve the dispatchability of existing coal-fired stations
on an economic basis.  NYSEG is already cofiring wood chips on
a limited basis (less than 1%) and has expressed similar reasons
for its interest in cofiring.
<P>
It is important to note that utilities
did not feel that SO2 reductions alone will have a significant
enough benefit to make cofiring a good investment.  It is clear
that other factors will have be present to make a cofiring retrofit
worthwhile.  In some discussions, previous attempts to cofire
more difficult biomass fuels, such as peat, or cofire by directly
mixing minimally processed biomass on the coal pile, led to operational
problems that has left some plant operators skeptical.  A cofiring
initiative on the part of DOE will have to consider these concerns
in addition to the other concerns typically raised for use of
biomass fuels.
<P>
Several strategy elements and issues are evolving
from these and other similar assessments in the region.  For interested
utilities, the unknowns and concerns that need to be addressed
include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Potential boiler operation impacts: efficiency losses,
increased slagging potential, boiler capacity derating, fuel feed
control and boiler response, downtime for retrofits, combustion
instability, and unknown levels of emissions (NOx, VOCs, CO, SOx,
PM10).
<P>
<LI>Fuel delivery, handling and stocking concerns: fuel
deliveries (access and congestion), on-site fuel storage area
required for low density fuel, fuel pile emissions, fire hazards
and decomposition, separate on-site fuel processing equipment
needs, fuel feed and boiler interconnections, fuel processing
and handling safety, system flexibility for coal/biomass interchange
and systems reliability.
<P>
<LI>Fuel procurement: availability,
price and its impact on plant dispatchability, fuel contract administration,
fuel quality assurance and variability.
<P>
<LI>Impacts on environmental
controls: ESP, baghouse or scrubber  performance impacts and their
consequences for permit compliance or review.
<P>
<LI>Impacts on plant
staffing.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, plant managers will want to know if the
positive benefits of cofiring outweigh the possible problems of
plant and operational modifications to accommodate the use of
the fuel.  To convince system and plant managers to pursue cofiring
projects, joint venture activities must address the issues in
three ways.  First and foremost, there is a desire to see that
retrofits can be made with minimal impacts on plant capacity,
operations, and dispatchability.  Second, the benefits of cofiring
must translate into meaningful incentives.  This could include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>achieving NOx or SOx compliance through cofiring without
further modifications
<P>
<LI>increased run-time (capacity factor)
due to reduced operating costs and/or environmental dispatch incentives,
such as carbon dioxide caps on generation
<P>
<LI>reductions in loadings
of local municipal landfills from industrial sources due to diversion
to cofiring facilities
</UL>
<P>
Third, the fuel procurement systems must
be demonstrated to assure plant managers that a sufficient long-term
source of known quality fuel will be available to the plant.
<P>
The
types of projects that are required include generic design studies
for each of the major boiler configurations, demonstration projects
designed to address all aspects of the retrofit and cofiring operations.
 Specific joint venture hardware tests might include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>evaluation
of preprocessing equipment capability to meet desired fuel specifications
that minimize boiler modifications (fuel dryers, and mills);
<P>
<LI>evaluations of alternative boiler retrofit options to optimize
combustion stability, completeness, and minimize regulated emissions;
<P>
<LI>evaluations of boiler and fuel feed equipment configurations
that permit a high degree of flexibility with respect to fuel
mix and boiler response to load changes;
<P>
<LI>on the institutional
side, initiatives that address possible evaluation of changes
in dispatch rules and system operations and accounting that provide
incentives based on the demonstrated benefits of cofiring.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="4.2"><B>4.2 Expanded Resource Availability</B></A>
<P>
One general area of need and
opportunity will be projects and activities that expand the current
resource base available to power producers.  As can be seen in
Exhibit 4-2, byproducts such as agricultural residues represent the upper
end of the current supply curve in California.  The possibilities
raised span the potential market from wood and paper byproduct
streams to energy crops as a supplemental source.  Nearly all
the IPP and utility representatives expressed the desire to be
able to use a wider base of fuel resources economically.  It was
very clear from the meetings that the continued survival of the
nascent biomass power industry would depend on the expansion of
availability of diverse, low-cost fuel sources.  Each potential
resource has a specific set of issues to be addressed although
environmental, collection and permitting issues pervade them all.
 Many of the potential feedstock sources are byproducts of industrial
or agricultural operations.  It will be more efficient for the
Biomass Power Program to work jointly with DOE Industrial Energy
R&D Programs and USDA Product Development Programs to develop
these resources.
<P>
<B>Efficient collection of agricultural residues</B>.
 Orchard prunings, and wheat and rice straw are a few of the sources
that the IPPs and utilities expressed interest in utilizing as
a fuel source.  However, these residues can be costly to collect
and their availability is seasonal.  The further tightening of
open field burning restrictions could prove to be a strong motivating
factor for these efforts.  Estimates of the farmer's cost to collect
and bail wheat materials range from $17 to $30 per ton.  Furthermore,
the resource is low density, on the order of 1 to 3 tons per acre
per year.  The desirable solution appears to be the development
of collection processes that are integrated with harvesting. 
By densifying and collecting the material as a part of the harvesting
process, these fuels could be affordably collected.  Collection
must then be augmented by an efficient delivery system to transport
fuels to the plant.
<P>
<B>Increasing the availability of residues
from improved forest management practices</B>.  In California
and the Pacific Northwest, concerns for habitat protection continue
to be strongly supported.  However, the economic downturn coupled
with recent experiences with forest fires and the desire to use
forest resources to benefit economic growth have spurred efforts
to institute forest management practices that consider the benefits
of removing salvageable materials that would otherwise be tinder
for forest fires.  The industry that must operate in this region
generally feels that the level of emotion that pervades the forum
on the use of forest lands is hamstringing productive and environmentally
sound uses of the resource.  The initiative that the industry
is seeking here is to involve DOE and the Forest Service in efforts
that would gain acceptance for good management practices that
provide for the health of forests while permitting economic use
of the available resources.  Opportunities to demonstrate these
practices are being developed by the owners of Biomass One in
eastern Oregon at a 5-MWe site.  Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
has indicated its willingness to offer a renewable generation
rate for such projects and the Bonneville Power Administration
(BPA) could also be a player in this process.  The situation in
Vermont is similar, but the driving force for access to forest
resources has been towards management programs designed to cull
the low-value species that predominate in Vermont woods to allow
high-value species to make a comeback.  Burlington Electric considers
its fuel harvest management approach to be a model for the industry.
 Burlington suggested that one area where federal support could
be of direct assistance would be in providing resources to the
state forestry and agriculture programs to underwrite the costs
of surveying forest resources, developing harvest management plans,
and providing manpower for inspection to assure compliance with
authorized harvest plans.  This would directly reduce costs born
solely by the utility that increase fuel procurement costs. 
<P>
<B>Tapping treated mill byproduct materials</B>.  In addition
to untreated wood byproducts, the industry would like to access
other mill byproduct streams such as pulping process byproducts
or treated wood byproducts (fiberboard, plywood).  The ability
to economically process these byproducts into transportable fuel
forms and burn them without environmental permitting repercussions
is the primary issue.  JWP Energy Products, Inc., is concluding
a project in Virginia that burns paper mill sludges at a rate
of 32 DTPD.  Wheelabrator expressed interest in processes that
would pelletize pulp and paper sludges for fuel.  These fuels
are potentially of most value to the mills for cogeneration.
<P> 
<B>Tapping low-value paper byproduct streams</B>.  Treated
paper products such as newsprint, colored or finished paper and
chemically impregnated cardboard byproducts are difficult to recycle
into new paper products.  Rather than landfill these materials,
recycling them as fuels would be desirable.  One of the industry
contacts pointed out that the recycling of low-value paper sources
to produce paper often generates more mill sludge than paper.
 For these materials, fuel uses may be the higher value use with
the least environmental impact.  JWP Energy Products, Inc., is
particularly interested in developing a multi-fueled energy project
in northern Idaho to demonstrate low emissions from today's fluidized
bed combustion technology.
<P>
<B>Tapping urban wood materials
from the solid waste stream</B>.  Several efforts are being pursued
that tap into the urban wood materials supply, thus diverting
it from the solid waste stream.  Burlington is accepting yard
and tree trimmings at the McNeil station.  Wheelabrator is in
the process of building a 39-MWe energy facility in Polk County,
Florida, that will burn a combination of yard and tree trimmings,
used tires, and landfill gas.  Thermo Energy has three operating
facilities and is completing a fourth that use urban wood as a
fuel source.  Use of urban wood has been extensively evaluated
by New York State and others as an important source of fuel for
power production.  Use of urban wood directly reduces landfill
loading and provides low-cost fuel for power production.  The
primary issue has been concern with air emissions from the use
of treated wood products.  The NYSERDA work generally indicates
that with the exception of CCA-treated wood, the exposure risks
of combusting most treated wood are very slight or insignificant
and meet state guidelines.  NYSEG is particularly interested in
specialized used wood streams and is evaluating fuels such as
railroad ties and telephone poles.  Forced recycling goals for
California and other jurisdictions may make these fuel sources
more accessible.
<P>
<B>Early development of dedicated feedstock
supply system (DFSS) projects to supplement other fuel sources</B>.
 Possible use of DFSS as a source of fuel is being considered
for projects in Alabama, Minnesota, Virginia, Wisconsin, New York,
the Tennessee Valley, and California.  EPRI is very supportive
of this approach for two reasons: long term supply assurance and
disassociation of biomass from the potential environmental problems
of misusing forest resources, and limitations of byproduct or
waste fuels.  Two things appear to be necessary for the DFSS concept
to be accepted as economic for current industry projects-assurances
that the EPACT 92 production tax credits can be used by the project
and the ability to serve several markets with the biomass products
(eg. white wood going to paper production, bark and lesser grades
of wood harvested going to fuel uses).  In New York, NYSEG, Niagara
Mohawk, and SUNY (Syracuse) are pursuing a trial DFSS project
based on hybrid willow clones.  The fuel produced would be test
co-fired in utility coal-fired boilers.  In Virginia, poplars
grown on existing farm acreage are being considered as a potential
fuel supplement option for obtaining a secure long-term fuel supply
required by lenders for a wood-fired IPP project.  In California,
the DFSS option is being given consideration as a supplemental
fuel source to provide an alternative to current sources that
are in high demand by competing uses.  Ag West Resources has proposed
a DFSS project to support the Thermo Energy project at Woodland,
California.  The Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD)
is working with the University of California-Davis to identify
the four most productive DFSS species for the Sacramento valley.
 With passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
pending, California is very concerned about the decline in state
agriculture with the opening of markets to products produced in
Mexico.  In the Tennessee Valley, DFSS projects offer the ability
to expand the use of biomass fuel sources needed to implement
TVA's coal- and wood-cofiring strategy without recourse to harvests
from environmentally sensitive resources.  Another interesting
concept put forth is the dual purpose use of energy crops as erosion
control and ground water filtering systems.  This increases the
value of the DFSS as a dual-purpose system.  In the San Joaquin
Valley, 600,000 eucalyptus and casuarina trees (some poplars also
tested) have been planted to control erosion and absorb selenium
salts from irrigation runoff.<sup>1</sup>

<A NAME="4.3"><B>4.3 Repowering Existing Steam
Turbine Stations</B></A>
<P>
Many of the generating units built by IPPs
were constructed when available biomass resources were inexpensive
and purchased power agreements were generous.  As such, combustion
efficiency was not considered a major issue at that time.  As
power purchase agreements expire and new contracts are negotiated,
the ability of many of these facilities to continue to be economically
productive will be in question.  In addition to tougher power
contracts, stricter environmental regulations and a tighter wood
supply situation are threatening the economic health of the industry.
 In California, IPP and QF biomass power stations now account
for approximately 4% of total generation for PG&E.  Repowering
projects can improve the efficiency and availability of some of
these plants to extend their useful life until a new generation
of conversion systems becomes commercially available.  This is
also true for two other classes of power facilities: wood-fired
units operated by the pulp and paper industry, and aging coal-fired
plants operated by the utilities or industry.  The pulp and paper
industry would benefit from a greater degree of self sufficiency
while the utilities could upgrade and extend the life of older
units.  Options include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Gasification of agricultural biomass
fuels to fire boilers previously plagued by slagging problems.
 Low-temperature gasification can produce a fuel gas that will
be free of slagging materials and can be fired in existing boilers
at relatively high efficiency  and with increased plant availability.
 There are a number of plants that have plentiful resources of
agricultural byproducts but cannot keep the boiler in operation
due to severe slagging problems.  Gasification could provide the
solution to reintroduce the agricultural byproduct fuels into
the operation.
<P>
<LI>Gasification combined cycle retrofits to increase
efficiency and reduce operating costs.  Repowering existing boilers
with a gasification combined cycle offers the potential to salvage
projects where fuel costs have made biomass operations uneconomic
(See Exhibit 4-3).  Green Mountain Power, with assistance
from EPRI, is giving this option consideration.  Burlington Electric's
McNeil Station is currently dispatched on an economic basis at
a low capacity factor and is a possible candidate for repowering.
 Approximately 40% of generated power is currently produced using
gas available during the summer at very low cost.  Gasification
combined cycle would reduce fuel operating costs by as much as
25%.  Paper and wood products industries such as Weyerhaeuser
have expressed interest in the gasification combined cycle with
the intent of being even more self sufficient in terms of self-producing
power for plant operations.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="4.4"><B>4.4 Modular Scale Prepackaged Generating
Systems and Custom Built Agripower Systems for International Markets</B></A>
<P>
For
international markets in areas where power is frequently needed
in smaller increments and biomass resources are plentiful, small
scale packaged biomass generators will be very attractive.  Several
companies are evaluating the market and the technology that would
best serve the market.  One company, Energeo, is committed to
development of those markets with the intent to offer a line of
prepackaged indirect-fired gas turbine generators sized from 200
kW up to several Megawatts (See Exhibit 4-4).
 PGI is also developing a product (direct-fired small gas turbines)
well suited to this market.  The opportunity exists for small
scale, modular biomass systems to compete in the international
marketplace with diesel-powered generators.  By using an inexpensive
indigenous resource, biomass power systems reduce dependence on
high-cost, imported fossil fuels.  Other companies have indicated
interest in offering prepackaged systems for biomass fuels based
on more conventional conversion equipment.
<P>
On a larger scale,
Agrilectric, JWP Electric, and other companies have targeted the
existing agricultural processing industry as potential power producers.
 The sector that has attracted the most initial interest is the
sugar industry, which typically uses its byproducts to produce
process heat.  By converting to higher efficiency cogeneration
equipment at these facilities, the industry and local economy
stand to benefit by the additional income generated by power sales.
 Both JWP and Agrilectric offer products that are suited to the
combustion of agricultural fuels.
<P>
Industries actively pursuing
international markets are aware of the programs sponsored by USAID
and Winrock and in several instances are already benefiting from
these 'technical assistance missions' to developing
nations.  The industry generally felt that these programs were
helpful and should not be duplicated by DOE.
<P>
One element these
programs do not address is the need to demonstrate performance,
maintainability, and reliability claims of the manufacturers.
 The need to see, first hand, a system operating on local feedstocks
for an extended period of time (up to one year) and to realize
the projected cost savings for replacing aging diesel equipment,
is commonly expressed by the purchasing agents of the governments
of developing nations.  An opportunity exists for DOE to pursue
joint venture projects in strategic locations worldwide that make
it easy for representatives of developing nations to see U.S.-built
systems in operation.  A second issue that is clearly of concern
to U.S. firms is the protection of the company's technology rights.
 Reverse engineering of the patented portions of U.S. equipment
is commonplace.  Once a product is available from in-country or
regional sources, there is little market left for the U.S. product
unless the company licenses the technology to in-country manufacturing
concerns and competes with local manufacturing labor.

<A NAME="4.5"><B>4.5 Developing
Markets for Biomass Power Byproducts</B></A>
<P>
Potential productive uses
of biomass ash include: liming agents and nutrients for agriculture,
landfill caps, sewage sludge stabilization, and structural fill.
 The issues for application of biomass ash are regulatory.  In
the state of Washington, wood ash is classified as a hazardous
waste based on pH>12.  This restricts both the handling and
application of the ash for agricultural uses.  A far more difficult
problem has arisen in California where rice straw ash has been
declared hazardous due to its high silica content.  One project
has been stockpiling the ash on site with the potential of becoming
a hazardous waste clean-up site unless appropriate disposal arrangements
are made.  For urban wood materials, the presence of heavy metals
and other contaminants from chemical treatment pose a problem
for ash disposal.  The approach recommended by industry to overcome
some of these regional restrictions is to develop environmental
consensus standards for biomass ash based on the real risks posed
for transport, application, and use.
<P>
Coproduction of chemicals
and power make it possible to operate plants at full capacity
to generate two product streams.  For gasification, methanol production
is a logical coproduct.  Methanol can be used as a turbine fuel,
a transportation fuel, or a chemical feedstock for other processes.
 Development of coproduction facilities was discussed only as
a future option.
<P>
<A NAME="4.6"><B>4.6 Capturing Legislative and Regulatory Incentives
</B></A>
<P>
The cofiring and niche opportunities described above may be
enhanced considerably by legislative and regulatory incentives
that encourage the use of renewable resources and resources that
have positive environmental attributes unlike conventional fuels.
 The picture for the biomass power industry is still somewhat
unclear, however.  For example, industry is generally aware of
the nature of the incentives provided under the recently-passed
Energy Policy Act of 1992, but is unsure of the direction of implementation.
 Thus, the influence of these factors can be potentially positive
for development of biopower projects, but may also lead to a 'wait
and see' approach that would postpone projects until a clear
direction for implementation is assured.  In addition, a number
of state organizations and utilities have instituted programs
that provide incentives for renewable technologies, and the Clean
Air Act Amendments also may provide for improved opportunities.
<P>
<B>Energy
Policy Act of 1992</B>
<P>
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 includes several
incentives for renewable energy power production, including a
renewable power production incentive (section 1212), a tax credit
for renewable energy electricity production (Section 1914), and
joint venture funds for renewable projects (Section 1201).  The
renewable energy production incentive provides for a payment from
DOE of 1.5 cents per kWh produced.  The coverage for this incentive,
however, is limited to plants with ownership by a governmental
entity (such as a state, political subdivision of a state, or
an instrumentality of a state) or a nonprofit electrical cooperative.
 The tax credit is to be part of the General Business Credit,
and applies only to qualified closed-loop biomass (and wind) plants,
and is set at a maximum of 1.5 cents per  kWh.  A closed-loop
biomass plant is defined as utilizing crops specifically grown
for fuel for an electricity plant.  The amount of the credit is
reduced if the average power purchase rates for biomass power
facilities exceed 8 cents per kWh or if there is federal or other
government cost sharing (grants, subsidies, etc.).  Both incentives
(sections 1212 and 1914) cover the first 10 years of the plant's
operation and are indexed for inflation.  A 1.5 cent per kWh production
incentive is equivalent to a $.90 - $1.25 /MMBTU subsidy for the
biomass fuel at a plant with heat rates ranging from 16,000 to
12,000 Btu/kWh.  This incentive could make a difference for marginal
projects.  The industry could easily see the benefits for project
development but seemed skeptical about being able to realize the
potential benefits.  Issues raised by the industry include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The law specifies that the credit applies to 'new facilities'
built after 1992.  Many of the real opportunities are repowering
or cofiring retrofit projects, which are, by definition, upgrades
to existing facilities.  As such, the law bypasses some of the
most realistic near-term opportunities available for biopower
development.
<P>
<LI>Early DFSS projects are likely to serve two markets
simultaneously: fiber and fuel.  Extension of the definition of
DFSS to cover these projects will increase the chances that DFSS
will be considered by plant developers.
</UL>
<P>
The renewable energy joint
ventures program seems particularly attractive to utilities or
project developers who are considering use of DFSS as a supplemental
fuel supply.  There is also interest in the use of joint venture
funds for both cofiring and gasification demonstrations.
<P>
<B>Externality
Valuation and Regulations</B>
<P>
Many jurisdictions of the U.S. are
giving consideration to the recognition of externalities in the
utility resource planning process.  The impetus for this consideration
comes from many sources, including implementation of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990, state and local legislation/regulations,
and a number of other sources.  In addition, this recognition
comes in many forms, but there is no consensus concerning methodology
or the degree to which externalities should impact decision making.
 In its broadest sense, any credit or debit based on social or
environmental interests that is used to alter decisions that would
normally be based on a purely economic and technical risk assessment
serves as an externality.  An immediate example is the proposed
BTU tax, which provides a favorable treatment for biomass fuels
for power generation by exempting them from the tax. The biomass
IPP industry generally favors the use of externalities because
they believe that they will tend to favor renewable energy projects
and, more specifically, biomass fuels.  The utilities, on the
other hand, generally favor the traditional economic assessment
approach with qualitative consideration given to other factors.
 While some utilities are adamantly opposed to the quantitative
use of externalities, others have developed and used them in their
resource planning process.  Some examples include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Vermont
has issued an executive order for 20% CO2 reduction for energy
uses and has instituted a renewable power purchase program.
<P>
<LI>Puget Power provides a 10% credit for renewable regeneration
sources in bidding.
<P>
<LI>Idaho offers 6.5 cents per kWh for renewable
generators less than 10 Mwe.
<P>
<LI>The CAAA have instituted allowance
trading for SO2 emissions.  The low sulfur content of biomass
fuels permits utilities to earn allowances when they substitute
biomass for coal fuels.
<P>
<LI>The California Assembly directed the
state PUC to set aside 50% of future generating capacity for renewables.
<P>
<LI>New York established a program to procure 300 MW of new renewable
capacity by January 1, 1994, if it could be procured at an acceptable
price premium.
<P>
<LI>Iowa established a statewide renewable capacity
procurement of 105 MW at a contract rate of approximately 6 cents
per kWh.
<P>
<LI>Wisconsin's PSC approved an investment/purchase
incentive of 0.25 cents per kWh for biomass-generated electricity
for up to 20 years if projects are on-line by December 1998.
</UL>
<P>
At
the level of current externality valuations, most in the industry
felt that the gap between biopower projects and gas turbine projects
could not be made up.  There is, however, a good deal of concern
about the possible imposition of carbon taxes or carbon limits.
 Most of the industry seemed to feel that this could make the
difference as long as the 'no net CO2' principle for
biomass is accepted.  Until the rules for valuing reduced CO2
emissions are in place, the industry has suggested that a systematic
approach for 'banking' credits for reductions would
provide some initial incentive for companies considering biomass
cofiring or repowering projects.  These early reductions would
be credited to the utilities' CO2 accounts pending the imposition
of caps and allowance trading.  Without such a system there will
be some inertia against reducing what may become the baseline
emissions under future regulation.
