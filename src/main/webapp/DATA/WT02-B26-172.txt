   Objectives and Importance of the Study 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   The objectives of this study is to  develop a image processing system, for remote sensing, which  is microcomputer  based,  low-cost, user-friendly  and  easy to  use, In the  1970's, graphics terminal  connected to  the mainframe computer  was utilized. However, due to  the high-cost  of the  system,  un-user-friendliness, and  slow  turn-around it  was not widely accepted by resource managers.  Thanks to the recent technology development  in the field of IBM PC  or compatibles,  costs of  microcomputer system  and image processing  peripherals were substantially reduced  while performance and capacity have  been dramatical ly improved.
   As a result many low-cost system were developed and commercially available for the  on-site experts in national land development, resource  exploration, environmental conservation, marine and oceanic research, weather forecasting, etc. Recently  interest in  utilizing  remote sensing  technology  has been  increased in some govemment offices,  national institutes,  and universities. Some  of them  already installed an image  processing system  at their  site. Thease  system usually  have been  introduced into Korea in turn-key base. With  turn-key based system, the local maintenance of the hardware and software is very difficult even though not impossible.
   Thus  it is  very  important to  develop  a low-cost,  easy-to-use  microcomputer image processing  system  and  distribute to  the  local  remote  sensing  specialists and  resource menagers.

   Conclusions 
</h2>
<ul>
<p>
   This year is  the second year of the proposed  three years study and We  have performed the suplementation and  expansion of the system  developed in the first year,  development of additional sofrware, production of user's manual.
   In the  final year, development  of additionally required  softwares, production of  technical and library manual, and commercialization of then-developed system will be camied out.
   Once this study  is successfully completed the  on-site resource managers will  be able to utilize the system  for delivering the information  necessary to their decision making  process. Also related technology in software development, hardware integration will be accumulated for other applications.
