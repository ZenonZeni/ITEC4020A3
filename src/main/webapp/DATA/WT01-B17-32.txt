A new patent has just been released describing a non-invasive therapeutic 
 approach that directly targets the build-up of artery deposits. It does 
 this by preventing cholesterol-transporting particles from accumulating 
 inside artery walls. This same technology can reverse existing deposits, 
 providing an alternative to the surgical treatment of cardiovascular diseases. 
 Developed by Matthias Rath, MD, the treatment uses ascorbate (vitamin C), 
 other antioxidants, and the amino acids proline and lysine.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>LOW LEVELS
OF VITAMIN C
FACILITATE CHOLESTEROL
BLOCKAGES.</CENTER>

<P>How does Dr. Rath's treatment work? Low levels of vitamin C facilitate
cholesterol blockages, while high levels prevent the formation of free radicals -
the out-of-control molecules that damage your healthy cells. Free radicals initiate
artery obstruction by damaging your artery walls. Vitamin C also helps to heal the
impaired areas of artery walls before they fill with cholesterol. The other
antioxidants and the proteins in Rath's regimen all work synergistically to make
this happen.

<P>Dr. Rath describes the symptoms of one of his patients: &quot;George is a patient
with a severe heart muscle weakness. He is an entrepreneur in his fifties. Three
years ago his life was changed by a sudden occurrence of cardiac failure - a
weakness of the heart muscle leading to decreased pumping function and to an
enlargement of the heart chambers. He could no longer fully meet his professional
requirements and had to give up his sports activities.

<P>&quot;On some days George felt so weak he couldn't climb stairs and he had to hold
his beverage glass with both hands.  Because of the continued weak pumping function
of his heart and the unfavorable prognosis of this disease, his cardiologist
recommended a heart transplant operation.

<P><CENTER>AFTER TWO MONTHS
GEORGE'S CARDIOLOGIST
NOTED A DECREASE
IN SIZE OF THE
PREVIOUSLY ENLARGED HEART.</CENTER>

<P>&quot;At this point George started to follow my cardiovascular health
recommendations. His physical strength improved gradually. Soon he could again
fulfill his professional obligations on a regular basis and was able to undertake
daily bicycle rides. After two months his cardiologist noted a decrease in size of
the previously enlarged heart, another sign of a recovering heart muscle. One month
later, George was able to undertake a business trip abroad by plane, and he could
attend to his business affairs without any physical limitations.

<P>&quot;I firmly believe that America's number one killer can be prevented by an
optimum intake of essential nutrients.&quot;
