<STRONG>Plan for Your Retirement with NYLIAC Variable Annuity</STRONG>
<P>




Retirement - spending time with family and friends, traveling, doing things you
didn't have a chance to do while you were working.<P>
But what if you're ready to retire and your finances won't let you? Will you be able to
afford a comfortable
standard of living without the security of your paycheck? <P>
NYLIAC Variable Annuity can help you prepare for the type of retirement you've always
dreamed
of. With
its tax-deferred growth,  variety of investment options and professional fund managers,
NYLIAC
Variable Annuity might be just what you're looking for.  It can even help provide you
with an
income for
the rest of your life.<P>
When you're planning for retirement, you need all the help you can get. Since earnings
grow
tax-deferred in NYLIAC Variable Annuity, your money may accumulate faster than it would
in a
similar
but taxable investment.<P>
Your needs and goals are unique, and are likely to change throughout your lifetime. With
NYLIAC
Variable Annuity, you have the option of choosing from a variety of investment divisions
that have
varying levels of risk. You also have the option of a Fixed Account with a guaranteed
interest rate.
Managing your money can be extremely time consuming. It can also be difficult keeping
track
of market
changes and interest rate fluctuations. With NYLIAC Variable Annuity, you can leave the
investing to
professionals. Fund managers with proven track records manage the portfolios.<P>
NYLIAC Variable Annuity is issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation
(NYLIAC), a
wholly owned subsidiary of New York Life Insurance Company and available through NYLIFE
Securities Inc. (member NASD) 51 Madison Avenue, NY NY 10010.<P>

<STRONG>Benefits of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
Earnings in NYLIAC Variable Annuity accumulate tax-deferred. In other words, you won't
pay
taxes on
your earnings until you decide to withdraw them. So, not only can your earnings compound
year
after
year, but they also remain untouched by taxes until withdrawal. This could translate into
extra dollars in
the long run. (Remember, withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% IRS
penalty.)
<P>
<STRONG>Controlling Your Taxes</STRONG><BR>
Since tax-deferral means that you won't be taxed until you withdraw your money, NYLIAC
Variable
Annuity can actually help you control your taxes. By planning your withdrawals, you can
spread out your
tax liability so you are not pushed into a higher bracket. 
NYLIAC Variable Annuity can offer you the opportunity to better control taxes. It can
help
your money
accumulate faster - and last longer.
<P>
<STRONG>Flexibility</STRONG>
<BR>
With NYLIAC Variable Annuity you design an investment portfolio that is right for you.
Based
on your
objectives and risk tolerance, you can select among a variety of investment options,
including stock,
bond, international equity and a fixed account. The Fixed Account has an interest rate
that
is periodically
set and guaranteed by NYLIAC.<P>
Because your needs and objectives may change, you can redesign your portfolio by making
tax-free
transfers among investment options. It's even easier when you use NYLIAC's toll-free
telephone
number.
<P>


<STRONG>Professional Management</STRONG><BR>
Although you choose the investment divisions for your policy, professional fund managers
at
MacKay
Shields Financial Corporation, Monitor Capital Advisors, Inc., Calvert Asset Management
Company,
Inc., and New York Life are responsible for managing the underlying portfolios of the
investment
divisions. Each portfolio is managed by experienced financial advisors who have proven
track
records
in investment management.
<P>
<STRONG>Dollar Cost Averaging</STRONG><BR>
Don't you wish you could predict the highs and lows of the market? Then you would be able
to
buy when
prices were low and sell when prices were high. But who has a crystal ball? <P>
You can avoid a lot of the guesswork if you dollar cost average. With dollar cost
averaging,
you set up a
program of scheduled investments - given dollar amounts invested at given points in time
-
and stick
to it, regardless of the changes in the markets. This consistent, disciplined approach
allows
you to take
advantage of market volatility by buying more investment units when prices are low and
fewer
when
prices are high. Although dollar cost averaging does not ensure a profit nor protect
against
a loss in a
declining market, over time a sustained dollar cost averaging strategy can reduce your
timing
risk and
optimize your return. Investors should consider their financial ability to continue
purchases
through
periods of low and high price levels.<P>
Dollar cost averaging is easy with NYLIAC Variable Annuity. Just select the automated
Dollar
Cost
Averaging feature, tell us how much to invest and how often, and we'll do the rest. 
<P>
<STRONG>Automatic Asset Reallocation</STRONG><BR>
You might want to maintain a particular allocation of your assets among certain
investment
divisions,
for example, keeping 30% in Bond, 30% in Capital Appreciation and 40% in International
Equity. Since
portfolio values change at different rates, you may need to move money between investment
divisions to
keep your desired ratio. It's a popular investment strategy - but it requires a lot of
maintenance.
<P>Fortunately, NYLIAC Variable Annuity offers an Automatic Asset Reallocation feature
that
allows
you to specify when - quarterly, semi-annually, or annually - NYLIAC will review your
accounts and
automatically make any necessary transfers to bring your distribution back into the
balance
you
selected.
<P>
<STRONG>Payout at Retirement</STRONG><BR>
With NYLIAC Variable Annuity you choose how you want to receive your retirement income.
Several
options include a guaranteed income that will last as long as you live. 
<P>
<STRONG>Withdrawals</STRONG><BR>
You may make withdrawals from your policy at any time, and NYLIAC Variable Annuity
features
attractive
withdrawal options.<P>
NYLIAC Variable Annuity's 10% Window allows you to withdraw 10% of your policy's cash
value
each policy year (less any surrender-charge-free withdrawals you made during the year)
without incurring surrender charges. And, if your policy has $100,000 or more in
accumulated
premium payments, you can withdraw the greater of: the gain in your policy, or the 10%
Window
amount, without incurring surrender charges. Certain withdrawals prior to age 59 1/2 may
be
subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
<P>
<STRONG>Loan Option for TSA Plans</STRONG><BR>
If you are investing in a NYLIAC Variable Annuity through a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA)
program at work,
there are certain loan provisions available. The loan options are available in TSAs only.
<P>
<STRONG>Protection for Your Heirs</STRONG><BR>
With NYLIAC Variable Annuity your heirs are guaranteed to receive the greater of the cash
value of your
policy, or any premiums paid less withdrawals. This means that even if the value of your
portfolio has
decreased, your heirs are guaranteed to receive at least the amount of money that you had
invested
(less any withdrawals and taxes, of course). NYLIAC guarantees it!
<P>
Request a NYLIAC prospectus package for more complete information including fees and
expenses.
Read it carefully for complete information on all product features before you invest or
send
money.<P>
The value of your investment, including the return of your principal, is subject to
market
risk.<P>
