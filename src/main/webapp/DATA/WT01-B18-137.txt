<IMG SRC="../../grf/dcT.gif" ALT="T" ALIGN=left WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="56">he Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an 
international group of 2,500 climate scientists assembled under the 
authority of the United Nations to monitor global climate, recently 
documented the causal link between human activity and global climate 
change. The IPCC report declares that the 6 billion metric tons of carbon 
emitted into the atmosphere globally each year are indeed heating the 
planet. Because economic growth and energy consumption have historically 
marched in lockstep, there is great concern that policy measures aimed at 
reducing fossil-fuel use could constrain future prosperity. <BR>
<p>     Fortunately, the world need not choose between catastrophic climate 
change and economic growth. A host of new technologies offers the means to 
simultaneously boost the economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. U.S. 
businesses, municipalities, and educational institutions are finding that 
investments in energy efficiency cut power bills and provide a rapid 
payback, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions. So while some argue that 
cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would be a costly drag on the 
economy,<a href="#1"  NAME="r1">[ 1 ]</A> </a>this report shows dozens of examples of how carbon dioxide 
reductions are often a beneficial side effect of profitable, energy-saving 
business choices.<BR>
<p>     Energy efficiency<a href="#2" NAME="r2">[ 2</a> ] </a>can increase profitability and competitiveness by 
lowering the cost of doing business. When businesses improve their 
manufacturing processes to use energy and raw materials more efficiently, 
carbon dioxide emissions and environmental compliance costs fall while 
profitability, productivity, and competitiveness improve, creating jobs.

<P><A HREF="#r1"  NAME="1">1.</a> Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) has been charged with assessing the economic costs of climate 
change. Some have argued for the use of "top-down" macroeconomic models, 
which look at aggregated statistical data, and claim that carbon dioxide 
emission controls could cost the U.S. economy 1 to 2 percent of GDP 
annually. On the other hand, "bottom-up" computer models find the opposite 
conclusion, that carbon dioxide emission controls could actually grow the 
economy by 1 to 2 percent annually through increased energy and economic 
efficiency, enhancing profitability, productivity, and new job 
creation.<BR>
<p>     Advocates for the "top down" models claim that it would be more 
cost-effective to delay implementation of carbon controls until current 
capital infrastructure and investments reach the end of their life-cycle. 
This argument, however, suffers in two respects. First, it fails to 
account for ecological reality: carbon dioxide continuously accumulates in 
the atmosphere, so emission reductions sooner are more valuable than 
reductions later. Second, it reflects an outmoded business philosophy. As 
discussed below, the businesses that will thrive in an increasingly 
competitive global economy are those that recognize the necessity of 
constant reinvestment in efficient production and productivity 
improvements. Energy efficiency investments will assist companies in 
becoming more productive and competitive, while helping the U.S. meet its 
international carbon dioxide reduction obligations. <I>See</I> Cutter
