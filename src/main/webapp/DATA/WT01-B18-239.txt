Robert C. Bonner, Administrator  
Drug Enforcement Administration  
Washington, D.C. 20537  

Dear Mr. Bonner:  

     I just finished reading your decision on the Marijuana 
Rescheduling Petition, 57 FR 10499 (March 26, 1992).  Your 
explanation of the scheduling criteria in the Controlled 
Substances Act (CSA) left me confused.  By your definition, a 
substance in Schedule II is a scientifically established chemical 
compound capable of reproduction in standardized dosages.  Of 
course, marijuana is not such a substance, it is a plant, not a 
drug.  

     Although you made no mention of the fact, the coca plant, 
from which cocaine is made, and the opium plant, from which 
morphine and heroin are made, are both in Schedule II of the CSA.  
As I was reading your decision, I wondered how these two plants 
can be in Schedule II.  These plants are subject to the same 
variances in chemistry as the marijuana plant.  It seems like you 
are treating marijuana unfairly.  

     If Congress intended to rely on scientifically established 
chemistry and reproducible dosages, why did Congress include the 
coca and opium plants in Schedule II?  

     It seems to me that these plants should not be included in 
the CSA at all, because they will never fit into your definition 
of drugs, and I think your definition is correct as far as it 
goes.  However, since Congress has decided to include them in the 
CSA, your definition is inadequate to explain them.  I hope you 
will correct your definition, and not simply ignore this apparent 
inconsistency.  

     Thank you for your attention.  

     Sincerely,  
     Carl Eric Olsen
