<H1> Mazda Denies Demise of the Rotary Engine </H1>

<EM>(from a report by the
<A HREF = "http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news2-20.html">Japan Times, Feb. 20</A>,
1996)</EM>

<P> <FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>azda <FONT SIZE=+2>M</FONT>otor Corp. denied a
newspaper report Feb. 20 that said the automaker may stop production of
its rotary engine, a trademark technological feature.  Hiroshima-based
<A HREF="mazda.html">Mazda</A> is the only automaker in the world to
mass-produce rotary engines, which are more compact and high-powered
than piston engines but have high fuel consumption.

<P> Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported that Mazda is studying the possibility
of halting production of the engine, quoting remarks by Ronald Leicht,
Mazda's senior managing director, who said the engine's fate will depend
on customer needs. Leicht came from Ford Motor Co. of the United States,
which owns 24 percent of Mazda and is pushing for restructuring of the
Japanese automaker.

<P> Mazda denied the report as "totally groundless." A Mazda spokesman
said the firm has exhibited a new model, the <A
HREF="rx-01.html">RX-01</A>, carrying a rotary engine at the Tokyo Motor
Show in October. Mazda is considering putting the RX-01 on sale in the
future and is also developing a new rotary engine using <A
HREF="hydrogen.html">hydrogen</A> fuel.

<P> The complete story is in

The Japan Times, Feb. 20</A>, 1996.

<H2> Source of Rumour Mazda May Stop Making Rotary Engines </H2>

<P> <KBD> Nikkei News Service  02/20/96 01:30 JST </KBD>


<P> Mazda Motor Corp. may stop producing rotary engines, Vice President
Ronald Leicht, who is responsible for domestic sales, has told The Nihon
Keizai Shimbun.  Mazda is the only automaker in the world to make rotary
engines.  Leicht implied that Mazda will stop production unless
prospects improve for sales of the RX-7 sports car, which is equipped
with rotary engines.

<P> However, only consumers can decide the fate of the engines, Leicht
said.

<P> Stopping production is expected to reduce annual expenses by several
billion yen, with over 50 workers engaged in development and design
reassigned elsewhere.

<P> Mazda, which set up a marketing headquarters in January, will make a
final decision this year following the reconsolidation of its sports car
business with Ford Motor Co., a top Mazda shareholder.

<P> Mazda assembled 5,000 rotary engines in 1995, against a peak of
240,000 in 1973.
