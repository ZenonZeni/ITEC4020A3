Based in Raleigh, NC, Boron Biologicals, Inc. (BBI) was founded by Dr. Bernard Spielvogel in 1986 to develop new molecular structures fabricated on the element boron. The company has positioned itself to be the top supplier of boronated compounds for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) cancer research. The company is currently selling products for evaluation in a variety of applications, including cancer clinical trials, and is positioned to introduce products for the rapidly growing DNA diagnostics markets over the next 6-12 months. In addition, this revolutionary and proprietary chemistry permits BBI to continue to add to a substantial pipeline of reagents, diagnostics, drugs, and industrial products.<P>

The company is currently producing both B-10 enriched p-boronophenyalanine (BPA) and sodium borocaptate (BSH) under Drug Master Files submitted to the FDA. In addition to supplying BPA to Brookhaven National Laboratory and others in the U.S., BBI is supplying BSH for the upcoming clinical trials by the European Consortium. BBI has also been supplying both BPA and BSH to European and Japanese workers in BNCT, as well as to BNCT researchers throughout the world.<P>

BBI's business development strategy capitalizes on the company's near-term product opportunities in DNA-based products together with the sales of existing compounds. BBI is negotiating combined license/supply agreements with leading multi-national life science companies for DNA sequencing and diagnostic applications and is preparing to sell sequencing kits under its own label through standard distributors.
