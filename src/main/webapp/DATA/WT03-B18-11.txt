<PRE>Because it's  a two way street we must try to understand
why ants do what they do.
<HR>
     While  ants learn quickly, people do not. So  don't  be
ashamed  that  it will take you and the ants  some  time  to
understand what you want of them and what they want of  you.
Don't use any poison at this point.  Allow the ants to feed freely
from the ant cafe.  They need to know it as the source of  food.
Watch and see if they are entering and actually taking away
the food and or water.
<HR>
    During  this time you should be using the Dr.  Bronners
Peppermint soap or some other natural soap as per chapter one
"Dances with Ants", inside the house and along any paths the
ants are using. Do not spray the ant cafes!
<HR>
     Ants  like a mixture that has a lot of water in  it  since water
is an important part of their diet, so  I make  1/2 water and
enough sugar, whether it is honey or white sugar  or whatever,
and I make sure that I add enough to thicken the water just
a little. Ants really do love honey and sugar, so give them that first!
<HR>
The results:
     The results you'll get from using the ant cafe will  be
that  almost right away you will notice less ants  indoors!
Soon  there will be only a few scouts looking around, but  the
majority of the ants wll be staying outside.
 This is just a simplied answer to get you immediate help.
There is more info available on natural ant control in the
clubs section which is available to IGA members only.
Plus there are many situations of ants that require different
solutions to solve the proble. What works for one may not work for
the other.
