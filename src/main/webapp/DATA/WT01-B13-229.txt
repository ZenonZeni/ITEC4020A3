Accounts">
<BR>

It's easy to open a gift account at Kemper. And, if the gift is
established to meet the requirements of your state's Uniform Gift to
Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA), it can enjoy
unique tax benefits. According to current Uniform Gift rules, you can
open a mutual fund account in a child's name and designate yourself, a
spouse or a friend to administer it until the youngster reaches adult
age. It is not necessary that the custodian be a parent.
<BR><BR>

<B>Q: How do I establish a gift account with Kemper?</B><BR>
<B>A:</B> Simply obtain the child's Social Security number and appoint a
custodian to manage the account. Complete a new account application,
making certain to check the box in Section 1, "Gift to a Minor," and
enter the names of the custodian and minor where indicated.
<BR><BR>

The minimum investment amount for a custodial account is $1,000 unless
you establish an <A HREF="autoinvesting.html">automatic investment plan</A>, in which case you can set up
an account for as little as $50. If you choose to establish an automatic
investment plan, be sure to complete Section 12 on the application.
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: What are the responsibilities of the custodian?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> The custodian for the account controls the money - how it is
invested
and spent - until the child legally comes of age. In most cases, the
legal age is 18 or 21 for the purposes of the Uniform Acts. However,
some states allow custodianship to extend beyond the age of majority. 
<BR><BR>

Here's a tip to bear in mind: As a parent, if you name yourself as
custodian and you die before your child becomes an adult (an adult is
often defined by the statutes as either age 18 or 21), the value of the gift account may be
included as part of your estate for federal tax purposes. In this case, you
may wish to consult your tax advisor about alternatives such as naming
some person other than yourself as custodian. Or, if you and your spouse make the gift
jointly, consider a third-party custodian.
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: What happens when the child reaches the age of majority?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> When the child reaches the adult age designated by the state
for
ending the custodianship, the assets are his or hers to spend or to
invest in any way. The money you invest on behalf of a child is
considered an irrevocable gift. The account you've established in one
child's name, for example, cannot be transferred to the name of another
minor.
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: What Kemper funds may I establish a gift account in?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> Kemper offers a range of funds that could be well suited for a
child's portfolio. <A HREF="../funds/spectrum.html">(Click here to view the Kemper Funds Risk/Return Spectrum.)</A> Your financial representative can help answer your
specific investing questions.
<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: What are the tax benefits of establishing a gift account for a
child?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> For children under the age of 14, the Internal Revenue Service
treats
a child's first $650 of unearned income ("unearned" means not
representing compensation for services) as tax-free. The second $650 of
unearned income is taxed at the child's marginal tax rate of 15 percent.
Any unearned income over $1,300 is taxed at the parent's top marginal
tax rate. (The parent's rate applies even if the gift comes from someone
else). This means that for an investment earning a hypothetical 8
percent* annually, you could have up to $16,250 in the child's name and
still qualify for favorable tax treatment on the $1,300 of income. For
children 14 years and older (at the end of the tax year), all earnings
after the first $650 are taxed at the child's tax rate.
<BR><BR>

You can further enhance the potential tax benefits of the gift by
choosing an investment strategy that emphasizes capital appreciation
over income. While income dividends are taxed up to the highest marginal
tax rate of 39.6 percent, the current maximum tax on capital gains is 28
percent. Growth stocks often pay low or no dividends because earnings
are needed to finance further growth. That being the case, capital growth
funds may be better from a current tax perspective (especially for
children under age 14). Keep in mind, however, that capital growth mutual
funds often make an annual distribution of any realized capital gains 
which would be taxable when distributed.
<BR><BR>

The procedures for calculating the tax for children under age 14 can be
very complex, with the amount of tax dependent upon both the type of
income (earned versus unearned) and the amount of deductions offsetting
that income. Additional information may be found in the U.S. Savings Bond Investor Information Guide, which is available from the <A HREF="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/pubdebt/save.html">Savings Bond page</A> of the U.S. Treasury web site. You may wish to consult with a tax, legal or other advisor
for more information, particularly if these gifts are to be part of a
larger financial plan. Please call Kemper's Shareholder Services
representatives at (800) 621-1048 for answers to administrative
questions.

<BR><BR><BR>

<B>Q: Does a Kemper Fund gift account qualify for the gift tax
exclusion?</B> <BR>
<B>A:</B> Yes, an UGMA gift qualifies for the $10,000 annual gift tax
exclusion. If your spouse consents and you file IRS Form 709 (this form can be retrieved from the <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS web site</A>), you and
your spouse may give up to $20,000 per year tax-free to each child.
