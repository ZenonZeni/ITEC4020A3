<H1><CENTER> California's "Cleaner Burning Gasoline": Boom or Bust?</CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
<font size=-1>
The following information about cleaner burning gasoline was provided by
the Society of Automotive Engineers  and does not necessarily reflect SEMA's views on
this issue.</font><BR>
<BR>
In June 1996 the California Air Resources Board required the introduction of CARB reformulated gasoline phase  2 (RFG) throughout California, although its phase-in began early in the year. The fuel was supposed to reduce ozone precursor emissions from vehicles by 15 percent and reduce the emissions of carcinogenic compounds such as benzene up to 40 percent.<BR>
<BR>
Since then, significant controversy has emerged regarding the fuel and its use. Reports regarding large drops in fuel economy of up to 50 percent (ARB predicted a 1-percent to 3- percent drop), increased fuel leaks and fuel system component failures (especially on older and some imported vehicles), and increased frequencies of vehicle fires were all attributed to RFG. Preliminary testing performed by and/or for CARB had not identified any of these problems. <BR>
<BR>
What are the facts? Are Californians driving leaking bombs (and getting poor fuel economy at the same time)? Or does RFG clean the air in a safe and economical fashion as "advertised?" My employer, the Automobile Club of Southern California, decided to try to find out. <BR>
<BR>
In late winter 1996 we performed a small test utilizing the Federal Test Procedure (on our emission dynamometer) to evaluate the effects of the fuel on fuel economy and tailpipe emissions. We also used a test track to evaluate acceleration (SAE recommended Practice J1491) and measured interior noise levels as well. Also, driveability was evaluated on the road under a variety of conditions. <BR>
<BR>
Results of this test concurred with CARB predictions. Emissions were improved about 15 percent; fuel economy dropped less than 3 percent; and acceleration, noise and driveability were not affected when comparing RFG with the base fuel available at the time. <BR>
<BR>
After the release of these test results, the controversy continued and since a short-term performance test could not verify or disprove the reports of deteriorating and leaking fuel systems, The Auto Club decided to follow-up the test program with a survey of motorists conducted in late September. <BR>
<BR>
A total of 10,200 motorists who own vehicles from 1923 to 1997 were polled. Questions were asked about fuel economy, fuel system leaks and repairs and fires. Results include: <BR>
<BR>
FUEL ECONOMY:<BR>
Those motorists who consistently track their fuel economy have experienced on average a drop in miles per gallon of 1.7 percent in 1996.
<BR>
<BR>
FUEL LEAKS:<BR>
About 3 percent of respondents had some sort of fuel system leak repaired in 1996. While this is considered a "normal" overall rate, 5.5 percent of pre-1982 vehicles received repairs in 1996 versus only l percent of post-1981 vehicles. These results may also be "normal," but the higher rate for older cars bears (and will receive) further study. <BR>
<BR>
VEHICLE FIRES:<BR>
Out of the entire survey, only 19 vehicle fires were reported. Of these, only one fuel-related vehicle fire occurred since the introduction of RFG. <BR>
<BR>
The bottom line appears to be that RFG is performing as predicted. Nineteen ninety-six  has brought the best air quality to Southern California on record. Further study must continue on older cars to make sure that RFG is not deteriorating fuel system components. <BR>
