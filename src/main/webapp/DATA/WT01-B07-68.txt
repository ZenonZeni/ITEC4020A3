In recent years two new ideas to design air-conditioning systems have spread very quickly in north-western Europe, displacement flow and cooled ceilings. These new air-conditioning systems are already frequently applied due to many advantages. There are many differences between this type of air flow compared with the better known mixed flow. Many questions arose about the design of the new systems: Dimensioning and location of the air outlets, influence of the thermal load, distribution of temperatures, velocities and concentrations in the occupied zone. Most of these questions are solved now and a survey about the design rules will be given and some applications will be shown.

Along with improvements of Chinese people's living standards, household air conditioners have already come into population's home right now. In order to evaluate the influence of air-conditioned ventilation upon indoor radon concentration in air, indoor radon levels were studied by a continuous electrostatic radon monitor (CER) under normal living conditions. Results show radon levels with air-conditioners were not much more than one in winter without it, although fixing household conditioner requires a sealed room which will lead higher radon levels. Turning on air-conditioner helps to lower it. Total effects are normal , ventilation , exhaust or indraft , exhaust plus indraft, and reduce the harm to human. In summary, air-conditioners are good for human health.

The purpose of this project is to examine the potential for backdrafting in ten houses having active soil depressurization radon mitigation systems installed and operating. As part of a State Innovative Radon Grant project supported by the State of Minnesota's Department of Health, we investigated the impact of radon mitigation system on house depressurization and backdrafting of atmospherically vented combustion devices. Ten houses were chosen in the Twin Cities metropolitan area that contain active radon mitigation systems. All had basements. Air leakage measurements of the houses showed a median air leakage of 6.0 air changes per hour at 50 Pascals pressure. Depressurization of the mechanical room relative to the outside was measured with the mitigation system off and in operation. The potential for backdrafting of the combustion equipment was also measured. We did not observe depressurization of the basements in any of the ten homes due to operation of the radon mitigation system. Worst-case depressurization was established by operating all exhaust equipment simultaneously. Worst-case depressurization caused backdrafting to occur in four of the ten houses. In one of the four the furnace began to draft after firing for three minutes. We tested the carbon monoxide production in the flues of each atmospherically vented combustion device during backdraft conditions. If the device did not experience backdrafting during the worst-case test, the backdraft was induced using a blower door. In tow of the ten houses elevated CO production was seen in one of the combustion appliances subject to backdrafting. Active soil depressurization systems did not add to backdrafting concerns in the houses tested.

It is expected to develop a method for measuring air exchange rate in large experimental hall by means of radon observation. The method was applied to a room with low air change rate. The radon exhalation rate measured by direct method has been found almost the same as the estimated value from air change rate and radon concentration in room air. The time variation of air change rate in the room was reproduced and observed indoor radon and exhalation rate from wall.

The thermal environment was continuously monitored for one week in winter and one week in summer in 4 naturally ventilated (NV) air-conditioned (AC) UK offices. Occupants considered the NV offices to be comfortable across a wider range of temperatures than AC offices in winter, but the range was similar in summer. The neutral temperature in NV offices was 1.3 degrees C lower in winter and 2.2 degrees C lower in summer than in AC offices. However, there was only a marginal difference in clothing insulation and activity levels between the two types of office. Discrepancies of up to 4 degrees C were found between the observed neutral temperatures and those predicted by international standards ISO7730. thermal comfort, natural ventilation, air conditioning

We use the refuse-air heat from hot tools in industrial shop to preheat the fresh air for the space heating. There is the technology-steam discharge through the steam pipe openings into the industrial shop. For this reason we have used the simulation software AZMAP. This software is based on the mathematical modeling of this energy system via a heat exchange network. The higher diameter of the opening means the higher steam loss but higher energy savings needed for the space heating of the industrial building. The adjustment of the fresh air-mass flow to obtain the thermal comfort in the industrial shop means the additional energy savings up to 3%.

In cold climates, the temperature difference between vertical room surfaces and adjacent room air is capable of initiating cold downward convection flows, which are often intensive enough to create local drafts. An investigation of convection induced by a cold window was conducted in a climate chamber. The window faced an outdoor temperature of about -12 degrees C. A flat unit, placed horizontally below the window, was used to simulate floor heating. By measurements of the sir flow, the draft was investigated. THe result shows that the heating hardly affects the flow along the window surface, but gives considerable effects on the air current spreading over the floor. With the local air temperature increased and the local air velocity reduced, the near-floor draft can be greatly suppressed by floor heating. draughts, window, test chamber

This paper describes the thermal environment and indoor air quality of 16 well-insulated and airtight houses in Senai and Moriaoka during the winter and summer of 1994. These houses have mechanical ventilation system and space heating system for a whole house. The thermal environment during the winter was comfortable, but some occupants complained of dryness of indoor air. During the summer, the indoor temperatures of houses did not rise so much without the cooling system, and it seems possible to be improved by cross ventilation or night time ventilation. The NO2 concentration were not so high. The concentration of NO2 with an unvented kerosene heater was higher than that without it.

Field measurements on thermal comfort were carried out in a passenger terminal building at an international airport and an office building with a big atrium using an instrumental cart built for investigating thermal environment from outdoor to indoor in transient spaces. Numerical simulation based on these field data was carried out to evaluate thermal comfort for sedentary and transient persons by using a thermo-regulation model with 16 body parts. It was found that the mean skin temperature of the transient persons was higher than that of sedentary ones. It was proved that atrium was functioning not only for pleasant atmosphere but also for a thermal buffer.

Air conditioned buildings are becoming more and more associated with the negative aspects of environmental services design. They are generally regarded as associated with high energy use, high capital and maintenance costs and building health and comfort problems. One reason for the poor performance of air conditioning systems is the potential for short-circuiting of air between the various supply and exhaust locations. This means that the air that is delivered to the occupied zone is not as "fresh" as it was intended to be. This paper discusses the problem of short-circuiting of exhaust and supply air in air conditioned offices. It identifies three main short-circuiting situations, at external, intermediate and internal locations. Results from a number of case studies are presented to illustrate the problems that occur in practice. These results suggest that short-circuiting happens more often than perhaps previously thought, and that it may be fundamental to current problems associated with poor indoor air quality. Some recommendations are provided for good practice.

Transport equations of room ages of air determined from tracer step-up and step-down experiments are derived under the condition that each room air is completely mixed and each flow rate of building airflow network is constant. Based on the derived transport equations of room ages of air, a new evaluation method of flow rates of building airflow network is proposed with a suitable tracer gas experiment procedure. Proposed transport equations are validated by comparison to the age distribution of rooms calculated from numerically simulated tracer gas experiments. A series of tracer step-down experiments were carried out of full-scale model house together with the direct measurement of flow rates. It was found that the age distribution of rooms calculated from the measured flow rates, and reversibly evaluated flow rates from the measured age distribution of rooms were in good agreement with the experiments.

The objective of the paper is research on aerodynamical and thermal phenomena in rooms supporting or impeding two-zone air flow characteristic for displacement ventilation. The tests were carried out in scale models of an industrial hall. The power and location of the heat sources as well as the air volume flux in quasi-laminar sup[ply flows were changed as the boundary conditions of the modelled process of displacement ventilation. Distributions of the air temperature and of the tracer gas concentrations were measured. The flows visualized were recorded with a video camera. The effect of the ventilation boundary conditions on the creation of an inter-layer which divided the inflow zone and circulation zone. The characteristics of the inter-layer and interface were tested. Occurrence of two-zone flow in displacement ventilation systems is affected by the following depending on one another factors: plumes, supply flows, their position and other geometrical conditions of the room. These factors should be considered and optimized individually while maintaining, however certain proportions between the air change and power of the heat sources as well as the layered air flow within the whole lower zone.

During the surgical operations, both the necessity of lower energy consumption and a deeper consideration to the risks of post-operative sepsis need a new approach in the assessment of the ventilation requirements for the operating rooms. An Indoor Air Quality Procedure is used to discuss the sterility level attainable in these rooms during a surgical operation, for different ventilation rates and consistency of the medical team. Furthermore, their typical time dependent behaviour and the time of de-contamination are discussed.

The first UK experiment to utilize human sensory perception as a measure of an indoor air's acceptability took place in 1872. Since this time several important investigation have been carried out, using human arbiter, to determine the minimum ventilation rate required to maintain indoor air as acceptable. Humans, rather than instrumentation, have been preferred ad they can give both a quantitative and qualitative dimension to the judgments. However, qualitative judgments such as the pleasantness, annoyance or nuisance of odours and irritants will depend strongly on the context in which they are measured. Traditionally, "visitors" to buildings are employed to measure the acceptability of the indoor air as the occupants will have adapted to the ambient odour levels with the subsequent loss of sensitivity. This paper reports on the findings of an experiment that utilized occupants, a trained panel and an untrained panel to judge the indoor air in a large air-conditioned office building sited in central London. The evaluations took place over three weeks and the outside ventilation rates were reduced during the second and third weeks. All participants were "blind" to the changes in ventilation rates. Results suggest that the three groups' basis for acceptability judgments are very different and that the occupants' perception of "air quality" may be influenced by prior knowledge that the outside air is polluted which will inevitably effect the quality of the indoor air. Recommendations for standard methods of assessment of indoor air quality are presented based on the results from this study.

"L" MARKET - now under construction - is based on the "clean building philosophy". A main goal is to deliver an office complex of approx. 76.000 metres squared without debris and building dust, such as mineral wool, cement, sand or gypsum. Implementation of a building project which employs new innovative techniques, requires the total co-operation and participation of contractor and sub-contractors. Accordingly, great emphasis is placed on the education of contractors and the displacement of conventional attitudes and practices. Unless individual workers can be convinced of the basic value of following "clean" construction procedures, there is no possibility of achieving one of the principal objectives of the original environmental plan, which was made for "L" MARKET. We have to convince the workers that the "clean building philosophy" is a benefit for their comfort and health during the construction time.

The contamination of rooms after application of pyrethroid insecticides was investigated in this study. Three different formulations containing deltamethrin, permethrin, piperonylbutoxide and pyrethrins were sprayed in a model house consisting of ten identical furnished rooms and their concentration monitored on surfaces, in house dust and airborne dust over a period of two years. The concentrations of permethrin and deltamethrin decreased very slowly during this period. After 70 weeks, permethrin applied as a solvent-based emulsion was found in house dust in concentrations of 200ug/g, and deltamethrin applied as an aqueous suspension in concentrations of 5ug/g. Decontamination of the rooms using a household cleanser substantially reduced the pyrethroid concentration.

The rapid increasing of population in the world, becoming barren of the earth land, and the damage of ecology balance are forcing mankind to pay attention to the underground space again. But the severe indoor environment problems of underground space, such as temperature, humidity and ventilation, have not been well solved, though some documents about those problems have been reported in recent years, which will obstruct the exploitation and utilization of underground space. In this paper, an experimental natural ventilation system with dehumidification in terms of special construction element measures has been designed and built in underground space. Measurements of its thermal-moisture properties was taken in the summer of 1994. The results have been qualitatively or quantitative analyzed. It shows that this system is effective to some degree to improve the thermal-moisture performance in the underground space. Finally, some useful suggestions have been proposed to ameliorate this system.

The contribution made by diesel exhaust particles (DEP) to indoor air pollutants was evaluated on the basis of concentrations of elemental carbon (EC), a major component of DEP. Concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM: particles of &lt;10µm diameter) and EC in indoor and outdoor air were measured at 8 private homes located between 5 and 150 metres from a main road. Samples were collected using an AND sampler capable of separating airborne particles according to aerodynamic diameter (&lt;2µm, 2-10µm, and &gt;10µm). EC concentration in indoor air of homes located within 5 metres of the roadside was 25µg/cubic metre while that for homes located between 60 and 150 metres from the roadside was 17µg/cubic metre. The contribution of DEP to SPM of &lt;2µm diameter in indoor air was evaluated at approximately 43-64% for homes located within 5 metres of the roadside and at 41-61% for those 60-150m distant.

Airborne contaminants can easily be distributed by HVAC systems an dispersed in air. The control of microbioaerosols and particulate can be done partly by better design, installation, operation and maintenance of HVAC systems, This paper discussed the influence of ventilation and air-conditioning system and filtration provision to aerosols level in health care buildings. Particulate levels at selected areas with different ventilation rates, air side systems and filtration provisions in a newly built hospital in Hong Kong have been studied. It has been found that CAV may not perform better than VAV and 100% fresh air may not perform better than recirculatory system. Human activities and movement may have significant contribution to the particulate level in the fine size mode.

Sensation of draught is one of the most common reasons for complaints about thermal environment. It is therefore of interest to investigate correlation between the existing draught criteria and convective heat loss from the human body. The measurements were carried out with a thermal manikin head heated to simulate thermal comfort sensation for a human head under different environment conditions. The mean heat loss from the head was measured together with the local heat loss in four different positions. The corresponding convective heat transfer coefficient was calculated for the air velocity between 0 and 0.4 m/s, turbulence between 10 and 70% and frequency between 0 and 1 Hz. The air temperature and mean radiant temperature were kept constant around 20.5 degrees C. The main result was that, generally, the increase in convective heat loss caused by increasing air velocity and/or increasing turbulence cannot, by itself, explain the corresponding increase in draught sensations. The difference between heat loss from different parts of the head was smaller than the one found in earlier investigations. A good correlation between convective heat transfer coefficient of the overall head and draught sensation, for percentage of dissatisfied DR lower than 25% was found.

At temperatures above comfort, sweating is increasingly important for human thermoregulation and air humidity becomes important when evaluating heat stress. Among heat acclimatized people, sweating is often quite efficient. Dry supply air may be a promising low-cost alternative to cooling in hot and humid areas. 123 heat-adapted subjects participated in six one-hour exposures in cubicles in a warm room without air conditioning. Each subject had individually-adjustable air outlets both above and below the desk. The temperature and humidity of the supply;air was varied in a blinded and randomized design. One exposure had no air supply. At the end of e#ach exposure the perceptions of subjects, water intake, skin temperatures, sweating and a simple performance measure were registered. The supply of de-humidified but not cooled air significantly increased acceptability and reduced most of the monitored indictors of heat stress. This reduction is possible even in offices without airtight enclosures when the dried air is supplied directly to each workplace.

In industrial buildings, the Edified Environmental Quality is very important, especially in Brazil, due to its warm and humid climate. Our subject is an industrial prefabricated building with a low internal heat generation and our objectives are: a) reduction in heat solar gains; b) save electric energy using natural light; c) intensive, well distributed and assured natural ventilation. We studied natural ventilation in laboratory experiments with a small-scale industrial building. The results show that it is possible to get good ventilation rates, that, associated with the other qualities, give industrial buildings Edified Environmental Quality and Energy Conservation.

A newly constructed and commissioned Research and Demonstration Facility allows for an evaluation of the as-built performances of a vertical displacement ventilation system and a conventional variable air volume system in two architecturally similar rooms with each served by its own independent HVAC system. Evaluations based on air temperature, velocity, and contaminant concentration measurements obtained at several location and heights in the two rooms and within the HVAC systems were performed at two thermal load conditions. As-built performance deficiencies suggest the need for a re-evaluation of commissioning criteria. Baseline thermal and air quality performance of the VDV system was superior to that of the VAV system. The data were also used to validate a unique two-zone model of displacement ventilation.

Four turbulence models, the "standard" k-e model, a modified k-e model, a RNG k-e model, and a Reynolds-stress model, were used to study a turbulent buoyant plume and room airflow with displacement ventilation. For the plume flow, it is found that the Reynolds-stress model predicted satisfactory velocity, temperature and turbulence quantities while the performance of the eddy-viscosity model is poor. For the room airflow, the computed airflow patterns, mean velocities, temperatures and contaminant concentrations agree reasonably with the experimental data obtained from a full-scale test chamber, but the discrepancies in some locations are large.

The results of laboratory measurements on the performance of the floor-supply displacement ventilation system are described. The experiments were performed in a controlled chamber configured to resemble a modern office space with modular workstation furniture and partitions. In addition to detailed measurements of temperature, air velocity, and tracer gas concentration, a skin-temperature-controlled thermal manikin was used to evaluate the quality of the non-uniform thermal environments produced by the proposed system in comparison to a conventional ceiling-based system. The results show that the proposed system could be operated to maintain acceptable thermal comfort and high ventilation efficiency in the occupied zone of the space, while at the same time taking advantage of the temperature stratification to achieve energy savings in air-conditioning of the space.

The outdoor thermal environment can affect displacement ventilation in tow related aspects, namely the additional vertical wall buoyancy flows generated and the additional cooling load generated. These effects are due to the altered interior wall surface temperature and heat flux. This paper used a computational fluid dynamics approach to examine the flow and temperature fields of a displacement ventilated room influenced by outdoor temperature and solar radiation. It is shown that the warmer floor and ceiling weaken the gravity currents and the ceiling-jet driven wall flows respectively.

To make a model for easy prediction of the room air temperature profiles in the under-floor air distribution system, the measurements were made in a full-scale test room on various conditions of heat loads and supply air flow rates. based on the measurement results, the room air flow patterns are estimated, and a model to account for those flow patterns is proposed. The application of the model clarifies some relationships regarding the air flow and the heat. The model is also used to predict the temperature profiles, reproducing the measured profiles well, and show that accurate heat load profiles are important for accurate prediction of temperature profiles.

In a displacement ventilated room the non-uniform contaminant distribution causes and improved indoor air quality in the occupied zone compared with conventional mixing ventilation. This has been demonstrated in numerous studies by chemical measurements. In this study the air quality in a displacement ventilated room was determined directly by asking humans about how they perceived the air quality. A trained sensory panel comprising 12 subjects assessed the perceived air quality immediately after entering a climate chamber. The experiments showed that the perceived air quality in the displacement ventilated chamber was substantially better than in the case of mixing ventilation.

A reliable prediction of heat transfer is very important in the analysis of displacement ventilation, not only to assess the system cooling load, but also to ensure that the system utilizes the thermal fluid flow principles to achieve the required vertical air displacement. Four different methods are used to extract the heat transfer data from the output of a computational fluid dynamics analysis. The total heat gain into the room from the outdoor environment can be more than 50% of the total cooling load. It is shown that the outdoor environment also affect their spatial distribution of the heat gain.

The present paper is devoted to the study of a displacement ventilation system regarding its applications to office and industrial environment. Although the principles of displacement ventilation are well-know, it appears that a correct use needs better knowledge for a good control of the flow pattern inside the room. Both experiments and calculations were carried out to investigate convective phenomena in such systems. The numerical study were performed using the CFD finite element code N3S and the CFD finite volume code ESTET. Different situations were investigated showing the influence of the main parameters such as, the heat release rate, the supply unit flow rate, the influence of cold walls on the flow pattern and temperature profile.

Non-use of residential mechanical ventilation equipment is due in part to the lack of user-friendly ventilation control systems. A prototype residential ventilation controller was developed and field-tested to determine its acceptability to home-owners. The prototype controller incorporated an adjustable duty cycle to control ventilation rate, programmable time-of-day scheduling, countdown timer override/purge to adjust CO" level, manual override with adjustable ventilation rate, and maximum-limit CO2-based override. Controllers were installed at 16 field test sites and data on CO2 concentration and ventilation fan use were taken over a four-month period. Home-owners reported a significant improvement indoor air quality and judged the prototype controller easy to use. Data analysis showed the average CO2 concentration was reduced by 7%.

The performance of a passive ventilation system using beam space as a fresh air supply chamber was investigated by use of a test house and computer simulations. In a test house of which equivalent leakage area is 2.0 (cm squared/m squared), the fresh-sir was not supplied to the first floor from the beam space. But the outside-air infiltrated to the first floor through the leaks and its volume fluctuated due to the wind. In a well-airtight house: 0.5 (cm squared/m squared), the fresh-air was supplied to every room and its volume was steady. Its indoor air quality was acceptable in winter in Sapporo, Japan.

Study of pressure and flow loss caused by heat-pipes for heat recovery was carried out using computational fluid dynamics. It has been shown that heat-pipes located in the bottom of the stack produce greater insertion flow loss (IFL) than those located at the top. In addition, heat-pipes located next to the stack walls give rise to less IFL than those places in the centre. The results also showed that a smaller insertion pressure (IPL) caused by a heat-pipe corresponds to a greater IFL and vice versa. It has been demonstrated that IFL is the preferred indicator for loss caused by obstacles submerged in stack flows. The temperature of the heat pipe has little effect on flow loss performance of the heat exchangers.

The temperature gradient in a displacement ventilation room has fascinated many workers in this field. A imitative office room was selected for this study. The room was ventilated by means of a low velocity diffuser standing on the floor and attached to the rear wall. The exhaust outlet is on the ceiling. Room temperature at several heights were recorded with 23 thermocouples. The relationship between the working area air temperature difference and the supply air temperature difference have been obtained. The relationship can become a reference on design of displacement ventilation system.

This paper aims to clarify the thermal performance in the rooms with displacement ventilation. Results of experiments performed on a 2.8m x 2.6m x3m test room with high heat loads (30-170W/m squared) are presented. Results of heat exchange analysis inside the room are also presented. The results of experiments indicate that the temperature stratification is strongly dependent on the air flow rate and heater height at a given heater input. Floor surface absorbs the heat from other surfaces by radiation and a great fraction of the heat is transferred from the floor surface to the floor structure. Results indicate the importance of floor insulation especially in this system.

The aim of this research is to see if the displacement ventilation principle can protect a person from the exposure to passive tobacco smoking. This is done by full-scale experiments with two breathing thermal manikins, smoke visualizations, and tracer gas measurements. In some situations, exhaled smoke will stratify in a certain height due to the vertical temperature gradient. This horizontal layer of exhaled tobacco smoke may lead to exposure. In other situations, the smoke is mixed into the upper zone, and the passive smoker is protected to some extent by the displacement principle and the convective boundary layer flow around the body.

It is the aim of this study to develop a mathematical model, describing indoor air pollutant concentrations as a function of indoor and outdoor sources. The work was carried out in two directions: development of a multi-zone air flow mode, and a transport model defining the pollutant concentrations in each zone of a building as a function of time. Data for simulation experiments were obtained from a typical Israeli apartments, constant outdoor concentrations, and assumed emission factors. It was found that indoor air quality is affected by meteorological conditions (wind), emissions from indoor sources, and the air tightness of a given building. The configuration of the staircase (open or closed and the presence of the vent top) also affects indoor air concentrations.
