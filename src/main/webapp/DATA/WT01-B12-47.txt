 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF SKIN </H2>

<P>   The areas of the thighs, legs, arms, abdomen, buttocks and along the trunk are a different type of skin than the face. These areas have certain regional characteristics that must be respected when formulating a total skin care system. Body skin tends to be thicker and contain more fatty material than the facial skin. This body skin can tolerate a more vigorous cleansing and will actually shine when cleansed well.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW FAT IS BURNED</H2>
<P>  The natural xanthine compounds contained in the FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION are theophylline conjugates.  These facilitate penetration of theophylline into and through the skin, all the way down to the fat tissues, which are special cells known as lipocytes or adipcytes that contain the fat.  In order for fat to be burned, it must be broken down by the enzyme lipase. In order for this to happen, lipase must be activated. The activation of lipase takes place after the completion of a series of other enzyme reactions involving protein kinases. This series of reactions is called a "kinase cascade." That is, one kinase activates another, which activates another, etc. until lipase is finally activated.   Another substance, Cyclic AMP starts this cascade. The level of Cyclic AMP has to be controlled so the body's fat stores are not completely used up.  Another enzyme called PDE inactivates Cyclic AMP. This happens rapidly as PDE destroys Cyclic AMP almost as fast as it is formed. Theophylline inhibits PDE so the action of Cyclic AMP can be prolonged. In this way, breaking down of fat by lipase can continue longer. This results in the burning of fat, a restructuring of the body and loss of weight.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MOST BENEFIT</H2>
<P> It  is  important  that  when  you  use  FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION for cellulite loss, weight loss and re-shaping, that you understand what is happening so you can receive the most benefit. It facilitates the body's natural process of breaking down fat so that it can be used up and eliminated.  You will receive maximum benefit if you exercise after you apply it to the areas you want to reduce. When you apply it, calories are liberated from fat breaking down. If you exercise when this is happening, the specific calories from fat will be burned. The result is specific weight loss from fat, which is ideal. Lean body mass percentage will increase and it will be easier to maintain the loss. It is not necessary to be over zealous with your exercise. Usually reasonable amounts of regular exercise like walking or cycling is adequate. For example, apply BODY PERFECTING LOTION to thighs and abdomen and take a brisk walk. You will be surprised at the positive results.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> FOOD INTAKE</H2>
<P> Food intake can play an important role. When we eat, insulin levels increase. Insulin blocks the action of lipase, which slows down body fat breakdown. This lessens the effect of theophylline. Therefore, if you desire maximum effects for cellulite or weight loss, delay eating for a while after applying BODY PERFECTING LOTION.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> MULTI-FUNCTIONAL</H2>
<P> FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION is not just for reducing fat and cellulite.  It is a wonderful, general body lotion that makes the skin feel soft and supple and look great, too. The special concentrated oat protein contains antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents and iron chelating agents. It provides a soft matte finish to the skin, which tends to reduce the appearance of aging lines. At the same time, this finish tends to scatter sunlight, which reduces its energy and thus provides more protection from ultraviolet damage.  The application of the FOREVER YOUNG BODY PERFECTING LOTION results in multiple benefits, as it is multi-functional. Its hydration of the skin permits a softer feel, and at the same time does not interfere with healthy skin physiology. It provides a good moisturizing function to combat dry skin. Not only does dry skin not feel good, but it also sends signals to lower tissues to produce more cells.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> SUGGESTIONS</H2>
<P>  The contouring action of the BODY PERFECTING LOTION is aimed at reducing those areas of fatty tissue, which protrude into the skin's surface. The system is based on the enzymes described above and works best when combined with mild exercise and a slight reduction in diet. It is important, however, to understand that its many special synergistic ingredients have been designed to meet the needs of skin, regardless of the activity level one has. A mild exercise program, coupled with the use of the BODY PERFECTING LOTION, will provide maximum benefit to the skin. It increases the skin's blood supply, which in turn allows more of the active ingredients to reach deeper levels of the skin. When you can, vigorously cleanse your body with the FOREVER YOUNG BODY SPONGE, then apply BODY PERFECTING LOTION where desired action is wanted, especially where cellulite is present.</P>

<P>Suggested Use: To reduce fat deposits or cellulite, gently apply to the abdomen, thighs, butocks or other areas being re-shaped. It is best to then walk or exercise to burn the fat calories that are liberated. Also, use as a high quality, body lotion everywhere.</P>
