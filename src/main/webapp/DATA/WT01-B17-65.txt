<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Fiber Facts</CENTER></H2>

Before you read the following information about fiber, let's test your knowledge of 
fiber facts. Which of each pair of foods do you think has more fiber:
<UL>
        <LI>Celery or broccoli?
        <LI>Apples or pears?
        <LI>Prunes, dates, or figs?
        <LI>White rice or brown rice?
        <LI>Beans or beets
        <LI>Chicken or beef?
        <LI>Yogurt or milk?
</UL>
According to the Journal of Nutrition (Sep 1994, 124 (9 Suppl): 1747S-1753S), the 
tenth edition of the Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) discusses carbohydrates 
in the context of dietary fiber and digestible carbohydrates, which provide energy. It 
recommends that more than half the energy requirement beyond infancy be provided by 
carbohydrates and that a desirable intake of fiber be achieved by consumption of 
fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole-grain cereals.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=90%>

<P>The researchers continue to assert that the association between high fiber
foods and protection against cardiovascular disease, colon cancer, and
diabetes is clear. But, they add, helpful information for consuming a diet high
enough in fiber is often confusing and sometimes even erroneous. 

<P>They remind us
that dietary fiber as well as nondigested starch are the only known dietary
components that increase stool weight and promote microflora in the large
intestine, both necessary for good health. 
<P>Mainstream physicians recommend
between 25 and 35 grams of fiber daily. Many nutrition-oriented practitioners
suggest even more-as much as 50 or 60 grams for optimal health. When you
consider that five heads of lettuce contain only 6 grams of fiber, and that
fruit is not in the high-fiber category, you realize how difficult it is to
get the desired amounts every day. 

<P>To help your fiber awareness, note the
hierarchy of fiber content: 

<P><B>Fiber Foods in Order of Fiber Quantity</B>
<UL><LI>Highest quantity of fiber 
        <UL><LI>Whole-grain cereals 
                <UL><LI>wheat

                        <LI>corn

                        <LI>rye
                        <LI>buckwheat
                        <LI>millet</UL></UL>
        <LI>A little less fiber
                <UL><LI>Legumes 
                        <UL><LI>peas
                                <LI>beans
                                <LI>lentils</UL>
                        <LI>Nuts
                        <LI>Seeds
                        <LI>Dried fruits</UL>
        <LI>Still less fiber
                <UL><LI>Root vegetables
                        <UL><LI>potatoes
                        <LI>carrots
                        <LI>parsnips
                        <LI>turnips</UL></UL>
        <LI>Even less fiber
                <UL><LI>Fruits
                <LI>Leafy vegetables
                        <UL><LI>lettuce
                        <LI>cabbage
                        <LI>celery</UL></UL></UL>
                        
        As you can see, foods that are highest in fiber are the ones we mush, mash,
and mangle before consumption. Whole-grain cereals have more fiber than their
cellulose-containing companions; fruit is not exactly a high-fiber food; and
leafy greens, although teeming with other virtues, have the least amount of
fiber in the garden patch.

<P>     When whole plant foods have been processed, the fiber is usually left
behind. Among the most extreme revisions have been the fiber-stripping that
takes place in the production of white flour and sugar. Other foods running a
close fiber-depleting detrimental second include processed white rice, corn
flour, corn flakes and other so-called "cold" cereals, pearled barley, molasses,
glucose, and maple syrups. Add fruit juices, wines, and even beer (which
contains fiber-free maltose), and it is obvious that you would have to be on an
unusual diet to be totally exempt from consuming processed, fiber-bankrupt
foods.

<P><B>Think about what you ate today. Did your meals contain enough fiber?</B>
<UL>TABLE TALK FIBER NOTES:
<LI>Although more is better in the case of fiber, more is
not better when you initially start increasing fiber use. <I>Increase gradually</I> to
avoid flatulence!
<LI>One cup of hot Wheatena cereal contains 3.6 grams of
fiber; One cup of Wheaties has 2 grams.
<LI>Nuts are good fiber foods. Almonds
are among the most stable of nuts and are even more stable than most other nuts
once shelled.
<LI>A portion of All-Bran contains 30 grams of fiber and offers
8.3 calories per gram of fiber. A portion of Rice Crispies contains only 1/5th
of one gram of fiber and offers 1,975 calories per gram of fiber.
<LI>We
ingest more food when its fiber is removed.
<LI>Fiber offers protection
against an increase in triglyceride levels in those who are consuming large
amounts of sugar.</UL>

<B>Answers to quiz:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Broccoli. Just because a food is crispy (celery)
doesn't mean it has a lot of fiber. Don't be fooled by crunchiness. Also note
that if a food didn't &quot;grow crispy," it's not in your best health interest.<LI>
Pears have almost twice the fiber content of an apple.
<LI>Figs have considerably
more fiber than prunes or dates. Two dates contain 1.2 grams of fiber; two figs
contain 4 grams.
<LI>Brown rice. Surely you knew the answer to this one! Fiber
content is almost always in the husk of a grain-the part that's sheared away in
processing.
<LI>Too bad beans have the general reputation of being a "lowly"
food in this country. Not only are beans high in fiber, but they have other
nutrition benefits, too.
<LI>Chicken or beef? Yogurt or milk? These are trick
questions! There is absolutely no fi ber in any animal product!</UL>
