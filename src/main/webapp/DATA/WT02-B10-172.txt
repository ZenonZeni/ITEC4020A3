We have focused our research efforts in the following major areas:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* the safety of antidepressant drugs in hospitalized depressed patients with cardiovascular disease;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* the efficacy of various antidepressants in outpatients with late-life depression;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* the relationship between depression and death with particular focus on heart attack patients with depression;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* pharmacological and psychological treatment of <A HREF="/nyspi/depts/psypharm/eating~1/index.htm">eating disorders</A>;
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
* smoking addiction, with special interest in the relationship between nicotine dependence and depression.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Cardiovascular Effects of Antidepressants</B>  We are conducting a four-year study of the cardiovascular effects of a new group of antidepressants, the serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Though these drugs have different cardiovascular effects from the tricyclics, they are being used with a false sense of "safety" in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease. Our studies will determine if these drugs prove to be more effective and safe than our standard antidepressants in patients with complicated cardiac problems. These cardiac studies have also allowed us the opportunity to determine the efficacy of the new antidepressants in the most severely depressed patients. Initially, it appears that the serotonin reuptake inhibitors may not be as effective as the standard tricyclics in the treatment of the hospitalized depressed patient. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Late Life Depression Clinic</B>  With the Department of Biological Psychiatry, we have opened a Late Life Depression Clinic focusing on the study of the phenomenology, biology, and treatment of depressed patients over the age of 60. Depression is a common illness in this growing segment of the population and there has been insufficient investigation to determine the safest and most effective treatment for them. This is the only research clinic focusing on depression in the elderly in New York City. Studies already completed in the clinic have demonstrated that the mild, chronic type of depression, called dysthymia, occurs in older age patients. Initial trials have suggested that medication may be of help for these patients. Currently, the clinic is conducting studies of the effectiveness of antidepressant medication in older age patients with both mild and more severe forms of depression. Ongoing studies are also directed at comparing the safety and efficacy of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors vs. the tricyclics in depressed patients with ischemic heart disease.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Antidepressant Studies in Patients After a Heart Attack</B>  There is now significant data to support the observation that depression dramatically increases the risk of dying after a heart attack. These data showing an increased mortality come in part from studies conducted in this department, arising both from our interest in the use of antidepressants in patients with heart disease and from our studies with smoking. What is not clear is if antidepressant drugs would be safe to use after a heart attack and, if they were used, if they would reduce 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
the risk of depression and the associated increase in mortality. Based on our long interest in the safety of antidepressant drugs in patients with heart disease, we propose and have been funded to look at the safety of these drugs immediately following an infarction. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Cardiac Studies in Children and Adults</B>  We have obtained information suggesting that the cardiovascular effects of tricyclic antidepressants are substantially different in children and adolescents than in adults. We are examining the physiological basis for these differences to determine whether they may increase the vulnerability to arrhythmias in some young people.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Treatment of Bulimia Nervosa, Anorexia Nervosa, and Binge Eating Disorder</B>  We have recently completed a controlled treatment study of bulimia nervosa aimed at determining the relative efficacy of supportive therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and the utility of adding antidepressant medication to these therapies. A controlled treatment study to compare the relative effectiveness of interpersonal therapy and CBT in women with bulimia nervosa has recently been initiated. We have also initiated a controlled trial using fluoxetine to facilitate weight gain in hospitalized patients with anorexia nervosa. Preliminary work regarding the effectiveness of CBT in the post-hospitalization prevention of relapse in anorexia nervosa has been completed, and we have initiated a controlled trial. We are also exploring the utility of CBT and of medication for the treatment of binge eating associated with obesity.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Eating Behavior Studies of Bulimia Nervosa and Binge Eating Disorder</B>  In continued collaborative studies with St. Luke's Medical Center, we are examining in detail the disturbances of eating behavior in these disorders. We have found increasing evidence of disturbance in the psychological and biological mechanisms responsible for the development of satiety in bulimia nervosa. We are also conducting studies to determine whether such disturbances also affect some obese individuals. 
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Study and Treatment of Nicotine Dependence</B>  In previous studies, we found a larger than expected rate of a history of major depressive disorder in our samples of heavy smokers and a lower success rate among those with such a history. We are continuing our trials of the effectiveness of antidepressants, combined with behavioral counseling, on smoking cessation and long-term abstinence and we are examining biological, psychological, social, and demographic variables that may have an impact on smoking cessation. We are also collaborating with the Cancer Institute to study the molecular effects of smoking in tumor promotion with a view to improving cancer risk assessment. In addition, we are collaborating in an investigation of a genetic marker in dependent smokers. Perhaps most importantly, we are following smokers with a history of major depression who are able to stop and those who are not, to see if smoking cessation influences the subsequent frequency of serious depressions.

<B>Training and Patient Care</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The unit staff are active in a broad range of training programs. The educational objectives for all residents are to learn: 1) how to recognize and treat major depression and eating disorders; 2) principles of pharmacology that govern the use of psychotropic medications; 3) and how to design smoking cessation programs to allow psychiatric patients to better tolerate smoke-free hospitals.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The 7th Floor Clinical Service of this department is a research unit devoted to the study and treatment of affective and eating disorders. Treatment modalities include antidepressants and ECT for depression, and antidepressants and cognitive behavior therapy for eating disorders.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Special Activities</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to regional seminars in psychopharmacology, the department administers a statewide psychopharmacology "Hotline." This is a service offered to New York State Department of Mental Health facilities across the state through which physicians may, by phone, get immediate expert advice on any drug-related psychiatric problem. It functions to improve the level of patient care throughout the New York State psychiatric system.
