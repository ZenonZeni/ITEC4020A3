<strong>GTS DURATEK MELTER COMMENCES RADIOACTIVE
OPERATIONS AT WESTINGHOUSE SAVANNAH RIVER FACILITY</strong>


<p>	COLUMBIA, Md. -- GTS Duratek (Nasdaq:  DRTK) today announced
that its DuraMelter 5000, the world's largest radioactive waste melter, has begun
converting low-level radioactive sludge from the United States Department of
Energy's (DOE) Savannah River Site into glass (a process called vitrification). 
This is the first commercial cleanup effort to use vitrification on a DOE site.


<p>	Robert E.  Prince, president and CEO said, "The commencing of
radioactive operations is a major milestone for the Company and for the
technology.  This uniquely gives us the experience to be a large player in the
multi-billion dollar cleanup effort that is only beginning."


<p>	Mario Fiori, DOE's Savannah River Site Operations Manager said,
"This project is the largest commercial use of vitrification to date.  GTS Duratek
has created good paying jobs in the South Carolina area, and is solving a very
important environmental problem.  In addition, the M Area cleanup is a key
commitment made to the state by the DOE, and GTS Duratek is on track to help
us meet our milestone."


<p>	GTS Duratek built, owns and operates the facility on the Savannah River
Site for cleaning up low-level radioactive waste.  The Company will convert
660,000 gallons of waste into glass over the next 6 to 12 months.  This waste
represents only 1% of the waste at the Savannah River Site.  Upon completion of
this contract, GTS Duratek's facility will be available to process additional waste.  


<p>	GTS Duratek, along with its strategic ally BNFL Inc., was recently
awarded a contract -- estimated to be worth up to $4 billion -- to design, build,
operate and decommission a facility located at the DOE's Hanford Site in
Richland, Washington.  The DuraMelter 5000 is one-third the size of the melter
that will be used for the Hanford project, and the Savannah River facility was
designed to be the small-scale prototype for Hanford in order to better develop the
technology needed.  The Hanford facility will convert up to 6 million gallons of
high-level radioactive waste in the first phase of the largest environmental waste
cleanup for the DOE.  Cleanup of DOE sites across the country -- containing over
tens of millions of gallons of similar hazardous and radioactive waste -- requires
technologies such as vitrification and is estimated to cost over $230 billion.


<p>	GTS Duratek is an environmental technology and services firm that uses
its proprietary vitrification processes to convert radioactive and hazardous waste
into glass for environmentally safe long-term storage and disposal.
