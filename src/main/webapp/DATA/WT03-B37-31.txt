Check Fraud: A Problem That Just Won't Go Away


Check fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem destined only to intensify.
Depending on who you talk to, bad checks are siphoning as much as $11 billion
a year from the U.S.  economy.  That's more than the combined yearly totals
for automated teller machine, credit card and wire transfer fraud, according
to industry sources.

Indeed, while the headlines of the business press for years have heralded the
threat of computer hackers accessing and pillaging the bank accounts of
corporate America, a small army of criminals has been amassing wealth by
forging and doctoring corporate America's old standby payment method:  the
check.  Anyone with a few thousand dollars to invest in desktop publishing
software, some scanning equipment and a laser printer, and who has the desire
to commit check fraud can print bogus checks that fool even the most astute
bankers.  (Color copiers are another option, although the bogus checks they
produce typically are not as sophisticated as the desktop variety.)

"The amount of money involved in computer fraud is minimal compared to check
fraud," says Dan McGurl, president, Bottomline Technologies, Inc., a
Portsmouth, NH, company that markets automated disbursement systems to
corporations and banks.  "The ease with which an individual inclined to do
this kind of thing can now rip off corporate checking accounts is astounding."

In a backhanded way, that's good news for McGurl.  His firm is part of an
offensive that has emerged to counter check fraud using a concept known as
positive pay.  A company using positive pay provides its bank each day with an
electronic list of checks issued that day.  The bank then uses the list to
verify the authenticity of checks presented against the company's account.
Bottomline sells software, dubbed Positive PayLink, that lets companies create
these files and transmit the information to banks.  At a cost of about
$10,000, just under 100 companies have purchased the system since its
introduction in mid-1995, according to McGurl.

Tough sell

McGurl sees great promise in Positive PayLink, and in the general trend toward
positive pay services.  "Every check-issuing organization is going to want to
get into positive pay as long as the check system is the way it is today," he
insists.

But it isn't that easy to sell corporations on positive pay.  Most bankers are
doing well if they can convince 10 to 20 percent of their corporate customers
to use positive pay, says Bruce Brett, senior vice president, Signet Bank,
Richmond, VA.  "I guess check fraud just isn't bad enough yet," gripes Brett,
who chairs the American Bankers Association's check fraud task force.

Or, suggests Richard Poje, partner, Treasury Strategies Inc., a Chicago-based
cash management consulting firm, check fraud losses just haven't hit enough
corporate issuers of checks.  "The best time to be selling a positive pay
product is the morning after a fraud has occurred," Poje suggests.

In the meantime, bankers are beginning to shop around for other check fraud
weapons, like online verification services.  Dan Fisher, senior vice
president, Victoria Bank and Trust, Victoria, TX, says a case can be made for
creating an electronic positive file of checks that operates akin to credit
card authorization systems.  "If you can set up a negative file for bad
checks, why can't you set up a positive file of good checks?"  he asks.

Some banks are doing that now through a company known as Primary Payment
Systems Inc., which was founded by Star System Inc., a bank-owned EFT network
based in California.  The company maintains a database of information on
checking accounts at participating financial institutions.  Banks, or check
verification companies, use the information to decide whether checks should be
honored.  As of last fall, the Primary Payment database contained information
on 22 million checking accounts at 20 financial institutions in California and
surrounding states.  Participation is poised to expand, however, as Primary
Payment goes national.  "By the end of 1996, we'll definitely have
participation beyond the western states," says Nikki Waters, Star senior vice
president.

The daily process of uploading account updates and verifying check deposits
against the Primary Payment database takes about five hours for a bank to
complete, start to finish, according to Waters.

Waters says Primary Payment participation makes good sense for banks.  "For
every $1 spent participating in deposit check [the Primary Payment service
that banks use to check on deposited checks], they can realize $9 to $10 in
savings," she relates.  The savings figures, Waters says, are based upon data
provided by some of the larger banks participating in Primary Payment.  These
participants include Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank and First Interstate
Bank.

Fee opportunity

Bankers and others involved with Primary Payment say it, or similar services,
can help retailers, too, and create new revenue opportunities for banks by
providing a venue for the sale of checking account information to firms that
sell check verification services to the merchant community.  Electronic
Transaction Corp., the Deluxe Corp.  unit that runs the Shared Check
Authorization Network (SCAN), and Telecheck, Houston, have already begun
testing the idea.

Representatives of the merchant community say they like the idea of bolstering
the data available on checking accounts and potential bad checks at the point
of sale.  But they say banks also need to do more to thwart consumers who pass
bad checks at the point of sale.  "These are shared problems," says Judy Cook,
president, Minnesota Retail Merchants Association.  "Trying to identify these
individuals at the outset and not letting them open checking accounts is where
the banks should be focusing their attention."

Cook says the merchant community in Minnesota has been successful in forcing
banks to more closely scrutinize individuals opening checking accounts.  But
the battle against check fraud is far from over, she concedes.

"No matter what you do, it seems the crooks always find another way to get
you," laments Cook.  "Cooperation is the real key."

IBOS Expands Its Ranks


Chase Manhattan Corp.  has tipped the scales of IBOS (Inter-Bank Online
System), the technology-savvy international payments network, toward the U.S.
Chase's recent purchase of a 24.05 percent stake in IBOS ratchets U.S.
ownership to a majority, rounding out the 24.05 percent held by Electronic
Data Systems, Plano, TX, and the 3.8 percent held by Goldman Sachs.  The
founding institutions, Banco Santander of Spain and The Royal Bank of
Scotland, both also own 24.05 percent of the company.

IBOS is an electronic network that links accounts within all participating
banks, allowing end-to-end international payments at both the retail and
wholesale level.  The network was created about four years ago, in
anticipation of increased cross-border transactions with the formation of the
European Community.  Indeed, increased global commerce has caused IBOS'
volumes to "more than double in the last 12 months," according to Thomas Metz,
director of global business development at IBOS and divisional vice president
of EDS in Dallas, although he would not reveal IBOS' exact volumes.

IBOS basically simplifies international banking for commercial and retail
customers.  Commercial customers who use IBOS-participating banks benefit by
not having to go through agent banks in foreign countries in order to get
certain cash management, securities and corporate banking services.  And
individuals benefit by being able to use foreign branches as if they were
branches in their own country.  For example, Chase customers vacationing in
Scotland could stop in at The Royal Bank of Scotland, identify themselves as
customers of an IBOS-participating bank and conduct their banking as if they
were at their home branch in the U.S.

Seal of approval

"Because Chase is the largest correspondent bank in the world and one of the
leading banks in international payments, they bring a tremendous amount of
credibility to IBOS," notes Metz.  "It's kind of like the Good Housekeeping
Seal of Approval.  Chase has indicated that it wants to create other virtual
banking alliances using its correspondent banks and add the IBOS payment
capability to Chase's broad range of corporate cash management products."

The global virtual bank of IBOS is racking up a bevy of new participants,
including Denmark's Unibank; ING Bank and Instituto Bancario San Paolo du
Torino-the largest banks in the Netherlands and Italy, respectively.  Other
non-equity members are Banco Comercio e Industria of Portugal, Credit
Commercial de France and Belgium's Kredietbank and Credit General de Banque.
Other banks are likely to sign on soon.  The EC Investment Services Directive
requires that all member countries' financial institutions and markets be open
to all EC participants.  When that law goes into effect, there could be a
landslide of banks joining IBOS, says Metz.

And, now that the largest U.S.  bank is in on the deal, others will likely
want to keep up with the Joneses.  "We hope other banks in the U.S.  will
follow suit," says Chuck Mallis, global marketing and strategic positioning
executive at Chase in New York City, who also sits on the Board of Directors
of the Society for Worldwide Financial Interbank Telecommunications
(S.W.I.F.T.).  "We do not believe in exclusivity.  Open access networks are
the way to go."

For 30 years, S.W.I.F.T.  has been smoothing out the cross-cultural kinks and
language barriers that would otherwise impede international transactions
amongst its member banks, which now total 3,000.  "There's been a lot of
confusion over what S.W.I.F.T.  and IBOS are," notes Barry Morse, vice
president of marketing at S.W.I.F.T.  in Lahoulpe, Belgium.  "The two services
are very complementary," he explains.  "When two banks send payments to each
other there's a lot of communications required as intermediate steps.  That is
the S.W.I.F.T component-standardized communications using correspondent
banks."

However, S.W.I.F.T.  is closing in on some of the services offered by IBOS.
S.W.I.F.T.  has arranged to offer foreign institutions access to the U.S.
Depository Trust Company's services, which include securities transfers;
kicked off an end-to-end cross-border account payment service called
S.W.I.F.T.Pay, and launched a service called Accord, which performs
cross-border matching and bilateral netting.

If banks want to conduct multilateral international netting, they can use
S.W.I.F.T.  to access the foreign exchange clearing houses that have been
sprouting up this summer.  "We do communications for Eccho [the London Stock
Exchange's foreign exchange clearinghouse]," Morse says.  "We do not have a
relationship with the U.S.'s [foreign exchange clearinghouses] F/XNet and
Multinet.  But we're all trying to solve the same problems in the industry:
the costs and risks associated with cross border payments and foreign
exchange.  Eventually, we will all be doing much of the same things and
potentially working together."

On a similar note, if S.W.I.F.T.  and IBOS were to pool their resources, "it
would open up opportunities in things like imaging and smart card
technologies," says Mallis.  "IBOS ultimately provides a virtual bank network
capability through multiple associations."  IBOS is currently talking with
officials in Russia and other eastern European countries about helping them
set up payment vehicles for their national clearing systems.  The group is
also discussing setting up a Web service, although that is not considered an
immediate concern.  "There is also potential for industries and their banks to
develop information networks on IBOS because of its broad bandwidth
capabilities," says Mallis.

Both IBOS and S.W.I.F.T.  have seen increasing activity.  "With these new
banks coming online, our volume is going to increase significantly," from the
doubling that just occurred over the past year, says Metz of IBOS.  "That is
allowing us to lower our prices to make it more proportionate to S.W.I.F.T.
pricing."

S.W.I.F.T.  volumes, meanwhile, have risen only 17 percent over last year, but
that represents a larger base number.  Notes Morse of S.W.I.F.T., "The value
of payments that go through the network is about [U.S.] $2.5 trillion every
day, half the annual GNP of America."

When Servicing Customers, Every Minute Counts


Cost-justifying a call center is getting easier by the minute, according to
Sprint Business.  By mimicking the pay system of an 800 number service, the
Dallas-based corporation has created a call center solution that offers a
creative way to finance customer service requirements-it's a price-per-minute
call center.

With this call center solution, there are no added costs or unexpected fees,
says Kay Jain, Sprint's manager of customer programs.  The package is designed
to ensure operating costs get offset by new revenue.  Total cost to the
financial institutions are a direct result of the activity in its call center.

Sprint's Call Center Connection includes all the equipment needed to outfit a
call center, from the automated call distributor, to the phones, along with
the network services needed to connect it to customers and prospects.  Sprint
teamed up with suppliers Rockwell Telecommunications, Downers Grove, IL, and
Northern Telecom, Chapel Hill, NC, to make the offering.

Each customized per-minute deal includes turnkey installation, on-going
maintenance and full warranty service, plus specialized training and system
upgrades.  Once installed on the bank's premises, bank management takes over
full control of the center to run its day-to-day operations.  If operations
warrant expansion, banks may add agents, equipment or services as needed.

The price-per-minute cost for the call center service is determined by how the
system is configured, the minimal annual usage commitment and the length of
the contract.  The customer's anticipated call volumes provide the basis for a
minimum annual usage commitment, which equals the minimum number of minutes
that agents will be handling calls in the course of a year.

According to Jain, after the number of minutes-per-year is established and the
customer decides on the equipment, the price can be determined for the
duration of a contract.  "We recommend a two to five year contract but there
is no set limit."

To help make it easier to track automated call distributor performance per
month, Sprint sends out two monthly billing statements, indicating long
distance usage and call center costs separately.

Microsoft Shifts Gears


Bill Gates quickly made amends for calling banks dinosaurs back in 1994,
during his keynote address at Bank Administration Institution's Retail
Delivery Systems conference.  Without skipping a beat, he then launched into a
sales pitch for Microsoft's latest offering to facilitate interactive banking.
This time around, bankers were more impressed than threatened.

"I never said banks are dinosaurs," he clarified during his speech, referring
to a quote that appeared in Newsweek.  "I actually said many banking systems
are dinosaurs."

The original dinosaur comment surfaced before Microsoft signed on about a
dozen banks to offer to their customers Microsoft's personal financial
management software, Money.  To many observers, distributing the powerful
Microsoft brand in such a way obscures and undermines the relationships banks
have with their customers.  Others also fear the set-up allows Microsoft to
somehow skim a small percent of fee revenue off transactions that occur
through Money.

Gates's latest interactive banking appeal, unveiled during his speech, is more
in keeping with the type of relationships banks are accustomed to having with
their vendors.  With high-tech fanfare, including a tongue-in-cheek video that
poked fun at the Internet as a "Web of Wealth," Gates introduced a suite of
tools and technologies for building profitable bank applications on Internet
and e-mail platforms.  "The Internet will be the primary connection between
banks and their customers," predicted Gates.

The December 5 speech actually was a preview to an announcement made two days
later in Seattle of a wide-ranging Microsoft commitment to the Internet.  At
that briefing, Microsoft introduced more than 20 products and tools to create
applications that encompass both Windows technology and the Internet.  "I
think most people are going to be surprised at the depth and breadth of our
commitment to integrate the Internet into our products," said Gates at that
briefing.

Just like old times

In exploiting this new delivery channel, Microsoft will follow a business
model of partnering with others, a practice it has taken since its origins,
when it relied on Intel to provide the microprocessors for its systems, Gates
said.  "Over the next five years, we will partner with more companies than we
have in the last 20.  And Microsoft will continue to do exactly what it does
today, which is write software."

Like any off-the-shelf software package, the new Internet tools are
licensable.  Banks will be able to use them to create what Gates terms
"virtual branches," which will be bank-branded and customizable.

Chief among the new tools will be Internet Studio (code-named Blackbird), an
authoring tool for developing Internet interfaces that incorporate multimedia,
such as sound and video.  Also available will be an Internet Information
Server, based on Windows NT.  These products will be available over the course
of 1996, and will join Microsoft's Internet browser, Explorer.  The
combination will support authentication and also embed secure protocols for
payments over the Internet.

Microsoft also has plans to jazz up e-mail.  New tools will make it possible
to transfer more than just text over e-mail connections.  For example, banks
could transmit formatted statements-complete with logos-via e-mail.  "This
will be a key element of what we provide," noted Gates.

During the presentation, Linda Parker, vice president, US Bancorp, was invited
to demonstrate how the bank built a direct link between e-mail and a loan
approval center it created on its Internet site.  US Bank is an early adopter
of Microsoft Money, as well as the new Internet tools.  The bank is well into
the process of using Microsoft's Internet Studio tools to build a
bank-branded, sales and service delivery channel over the Internet that links
to back-office data.

With Microsoft's new Internet-centric approach, the role of Money changes.
According to Gates, Money will become a "core database" or "file cabinet" that
banks will be able to customize and extend by adding, say, a third-party
retirement planning software package to it.  In the near term, Money will
receive various upgrades, including additional back-end processing options
beyond the current one from Intuit Processing Services, and the ability to
connect users to banks' Internet sites via hot links.

Kudos

For the most part, banks put aside their typical skepticism of Microsoft's
intentions and applauded the company's efforts.  "He [Gates] has done a great
job," says Tom Kitrick, vice president, First Union National Bank.  "He's
added more value to the customer interface, and that's the most important
thing."

Robert Hedges, executive vice president, Shawmut National Corp., brought up
the same two words:  customer interface.  "The future world is going to
revolve around the quality of the customer interface," he says.  "We have to
be in the business of knowing how to create a good one."

Shawmut will soon be folded into Fleet Financial Group, which is a part-owner
of Meca Software, Inc., a Fairfield, CT-based outfit that prides itself on its
bank-focused approach to distributing its Managing Your Money personal
financial software.  Hedges says that although the bank is now a part-owner of
Meca, it would be open to working with Microsoft on other projects.  "But only
on an open-systems basis, and only if we retain the customer interface."

In adopting an approach more amenable to banks, Microsoft has, at the same
time, shifted its position relative to its own competition.  Prior to
Microsoft's announcement of its Internet intentions, Intuit Inc.  and its
Quicken program occupied the same competitive terrain as Microsoft and Money.
Now that Microsoft has broadened its approach, it faces a new set of
competitors, namely Sun Microsystems.

Sun's Java, a tool that adds dynamics-such as multimedia-to Web browsers,
squares off against Microsoft's new Internet Studio.  Introduced in August,
Java allows small applications (called applets) to be transported from servers
over the Internet.  These applets latch on to client computers and liven up,
say with animation, Internet interactions of that client computer.  For
example, a client computer viewing the Web server of a bank that uses such
applets might let users to perform dynamic what-if analyses on loan options,
not just apply for a loan.

How the competition will pan out in this next stage of the interactive world
remains to be seen.  "Everything's changing," notes Kitrick of First Union,
who says he wants to see what happens with Java before he decides about
Internet Studio.  "Nothing is staying the same."

Answering The High-Tech Call


There's no doubt call centers are emerging as a popular way to reduce
operating costs while improving service to customers.  To wit, this technology
entrant placed first out of 12 in BTN's annual survey of the Best Of The
Newest banking technologies (see BTN, December 1995).  Today, the question for
many banks-especially medium- to small-sized ones-is deciding at what point,
if ever, they should move from standard voice response systems to full fledged
state-of-the-art call centers.

Most banks already have some type of voice response system in place to allow
for automated responses to routine customer service inquiries.  These
systems-once known for handling only simple inquiries such as savings or
checking account balances-are now equipped with a variety of increased
capabilities.  Integrated voice response applications can now process
virtually any information exchange including account balances, portfolio
information, bill payment, interest rates and mortgage pre-qualifications.

A fully customized, turnkey voice response solution can start at $30,000, and
quickly increases with advanced programming applications.  But despite all the
enhancements with voice response technology, it still has many limitations
compared to a full-blown call center solution.  Most notably missing is the
human interaction with customers.

Making the move

Advanced call centers employ customer service workstations backed by
computer-telephone integration.  Using computer-telephone integration to make
information that's locked away in computer databases available to telephone
systems is an act that's easier said than done.

The basic hardware for incoming call management is a standard set-up comprised
of private branch exchanges, automated call distributors and voice response
units.  The real feature that differentiates one bank's call center from
another's is in its use of middleware.  The middleware provides the connective
data integration link between a customer service representative's workstation
and an incoming call.

"The key to implementing a state-of-the-art call center is integration," says
Julie Fitzpatrick, product marketing manager at Early, Cloud & Co., Newport,
RI.  "Integrating customer information files allows a customer service
representative to access a wealth of information that assists in a variety of
capabilities and increases cross-selling opportunities."

Middleware is actually the doorway to accessing information, managing call and
data information, routing the information, managing workflow and monitoring
the system.  In addition to basic call management and data management
capabilities, more advanced services such as identifying numbers dialed by
callers, a process known as Designated Number Identification Service, as well
as identifying callers' telephone numbers, known as Automated Number
Identification, are available.

The more integration there is between computer and telephone systems, the
longer the list of services that a bank can offer through the phone.  Beyond
retrieving account balances, customers can authorize funds transfers, open
checking and savings accounts, apply for loans, pay off credit card balances
and the list goes on-directly over the phone.

Sky's the limit

Experts say the absolute minimum investment for a fully integrated call center
is $10,000 per seat, with $20,000 per seat not an unreasonable price for
higher configurations.  Basically, there is no definite price cap on the
investment because of all the different options and equipment available.  In
essence, stepping up from standard voice response to call-center
computer-telephone integration requires a significant investment, but it can
also be one with limitless possibilities.

A number of packaged call center automation software applications are
available.  One such package, scheduled for general release next quarter, is
Early Cloud's Call Flow Client.  The new desktop software environment lets
institutions automate telephone-based customer service operations with
computer-telephone integration, message-based data access and enterprise-wide
business workflow within a distributed client/server environment.

Call Flow Client helps retail banks tackle the project of building
comprehensive, completely integrated call centers, all the way from back-end
systems to customer service desktops, and eliminates the need to build every
call center application from scratch.  With its graphical interface
environment, developers can graphically define workflow processing and
individually design their call center environments.  The software package
offers a number of options ranging from historical transaction information;
new account openings for savings, checking, loans, CDs and IRAs; bill
payments, to an ATM locator feature with scanned map retrieval.

Although the costs associated with a full-blown call center versus a standard
voice response system vary, experts say cost is only one of many issues
relevant to the decision to plunge into call-center technology.  "Ultimately,
the decision is one that should be based on your marketing strategy and what
message your bank is trying to convey," says Lisa Stockburger, vice president
at Vanguard Communications Corp., Morris Plains, NJ.  "You have to determine,
'Do I want to be like the big boys or do I want to maintain my face-to-face
image associated with smaller banks?'"

Meeting challenges

For Bank United of Texas, $12 billion in assets, the decision to create an
advanced call center was strategic-the result of a long string of
acquisitions.  In 1990, Houston-based Bank United acquired six financial
institutions that had retail, mortgage and wholesale banking divisions.
Consolidating the different banks into one entity resulted in multiple
operating systems and a very confused customer base.  In addition, the bank
was further challenged by inadequate marketing of its telephone-based
services.

At the time, Bank United had only two small customer service centers located
in Houston and Dallas.  The centers operated during normal business hours and
offered very limited services.  And since they were scarcely promoted, many
customers were unaware of their existence at all.

The need for an improved customer service system was apparent.  According to
Pat Moretti, assistant vice president, the bank redefined is strategy and its
customer service mission statement to its current definition:  to enhance
value by providing an efficient, cost effective sales and service alternative
for existing and prospective Bank United customers on a national level.

Through its acquisitions, the bank had inherited a Syntellect voice response
system, which it is now considering upgrading, and it purchased an Aspect
switch from Aspect Telecommunications, San Jose, CA, for about $225,000 for
the new call center.  In addition, it is working on cost-justifying future
purchases of a TCS Forecaster Scheduler from TCS Management Group, Inc.,
Nashville, TN, which will run about $38,000, as well as an Alltel Customer
Service Platform Workstation from Alltel Information Services, Inc.  Little
Rock, AR, which will cost around $500,000.

Bank United's technology allows calls to be routed among five units within the
call center, including:  loan-by-phone; customer service; deposit sales;
support functions, and a systems administrator.  The bank is also introducing
a financial markets unit as an alternative service for annuities and
securities customers.  The bank maximizes the capability of its voice response
unit whenever applicable but always has a customer service representative
ready to respond.

Before implementing its full-blown call center, the bank's customer service
centers averaged about 126,000 calls received per month, of which 32,000 were
answered by live representatives.  With the telephone banking center, the
number of calls answered has increased to an average of 210,000 calls per
month with about 47,000 answered by representatives.

The call center also has had success with new-account openings, which were not
possible through the original customer service centers.  The current call
center averages about 400 new-account openings per month.  That rate is on par
with the number of accounts opened monthly at the largest of the 67 branches
Bank United operates throughout Texas, according to Moretti.

"We went from nothing to something," says Moretti, describing the call center,
which grew from eight to 41 employees.  At the same time, "we broadened our
customer base by catering to all types of customers."

For some banks, investing in a call center is tantamount to using technology
as a weapon to remain independent.  "Call centers are a major investment for
smaller banks, but one that is necessary if you wish to remain independent,"
says Pat Mackesey, vice president of telephone banking at Dauphin Deposit
Bank.  "And, it can be easily cost-justified if done correctly."

Mackesey was instrumental in the creation of Dauphin Deposit's telephone
banking center, introduced in November.  The Hanover, PA-based bank, with $5.5
billion in assets, owns and operates Farmers Bank, ValleysBank and Bank of
Pennsylvania, and now handles customer service for all those banks through a
single call center.  Dauphin Deposit's telephone banking center, which
currently employs a staff of 17, is projected to employ 50 people by April.
The bank also plans to offer underwriting services through the call center.

According to Mackesey, performance is the turning point in making a call
center a profit center.  He points out that the center creates a myriad of
opportunities for pro-active cross selling.  "There is a major positive
contribution in covering bank expense in a call center," he says.  "You are
able to take advantage of a customer service situation and turn it into a
sales opportunity."

Local flavor

"We took a basic customer service center and turned it into a multi-faceted
service and sales center with an expanded level of service," he says.  "It has
become an alternate delivery channel opportunity to service customers more
efficiently with more cost-effective means of banking."

With the installation of an Argo Platform system developed by Dallas-based
Argo Data Resource Corp., Dauphin Deposit succeeded in centralizing the call
center function, while still retaining the local flavor of each of the three
banks that comprise the institution.  The telephone number listed for all of
the banks is one centralized number.  When calls are received by the front-end
network, they are recognized and routed to the customer service representative
who will then answer with the appropriate branch name.

Mackesey said that the new call center is viewed as a "superbranch" and is
expected to enhance traditional branch production, not replace it.  Before
implementing the new call center, Dauphin Deposit had only one customer
service unit, which was not able to open any type of account.  The new call
center, which he says is already experiencing "encouraging" responses prior to
any advertising efforts has already proven to be effective in cross-selling
new accounts for the bank.

The right number

Similar telephone banking success was found at Oakland, MD-based First United
National Bank & Trust, $500 million in assets.  Its implementation of a new
call center increased efficiencies while offering cross-selling and outbound
telemarketing opportunities.  The bank's call center, which runs the Customer
Service and Correspondence system (CSCS) from Milwaukee-based Fiserv, handles
all transactions, customer needs and inquiries, and allows the bank to
automatically track calls, trends and sales.  Outbound telemarketing calls are
also documented on the system to record the number of sales produced.

Fiserv's CSCS system, with a starting cost of about $10,000 (and up, depending
upon the number of users and feature applications), provides a complete case
history of calls by automatically time- and date-stamping every comment
entered by customer service representatives.  It tracks the effectiveness of
individuals and departments in responding to customer requests.  The system
also provides online instructions and prompts to help solve problems, aid
cross-selling efforts and ensure consistent responses are communicated on
specific inquiries.

First United's call center, now staffed by four people, is expected to triple
by the end of this year.  Introduced last August, the number of calls actually
serviced increased immediately.  Prior to the new call center, calls were
distributed among various departments, which inevitably led to lost or missed
calls.  With the new call center, all calls are centralized and handled in a
standardized manner, increasing the number of calls serviced.

Robin Murray, customer service manager, adds that the telephone banking center
is viewed as a high growth area for the bank because it lets the bank expand
its customer base without having to expand its brick and mortar.

"The telephone banking center allows our in-branch sales force to do more
prospecting and less service-oriented transactions," says Murray.  "Our long
term strategy places a strong focus on our telephone center because of the
flexibility and convenience it provides combined with the personal touch that
satisfies customers."

Customizing your call center will essentially determine its cost.  According
to Jeanne Michelson, marketing representative at Telcom Technologies, Pomona
CA, the size of a call center is one important criteria in pricing it.  But
other variables weigh just as heavily.  These factors include the expected
value of your incoming calls, the general level of competition your business
faces and the experience level of your call center supervisors and managers.

Start-up and small call centers often opt for a private branch exchange, which
is a basic telephone switching system, because it can be inexpensive and is
usually already in place within the company.  Many of the more popular private
branch exchange systems can be purchased for less than $600 per station or
$1,200 to $2,800, along with an automated call distributor hardware/software
package.

A stand-alone automated call distributor, according to Telcom, typically costs
$2,200 to $3,000 per position, depending on the particular application and
configuration requirements.  Therefore, for a cost effective automated call
distributor, expect to see the following price ranges:  $35,000 to $45,000 for
a 15-agent system; $120,000 to $150,000 for a 50-agent system; $170,000 to
$225,000 for a 75-agent system.

Cost justifying a standalone automated call distributor comes down to a
variety of factors.  By determining caller demand, identifying sales
opportunities, calculating revenue losses (i.e., missed calls) and total
operational cost savings-personnel and telephone service usage-a bank can cost
justify its system on paper.  By adding revenue savings, personnel savings and
phone usage savings, a bank can determine eventual paybank in years by
dividing the total system cost by the total savings.

Solving Chicken-And-Egg Dilemmas In Electronic Bill Pay


Trying to get more consumers and merchants interested in electronic bill
payments is like trying to answer the question, "Which came first, the chicken
or the egg?"

The chicken:  many consumers are balking when asked to sign up for electronic
bill payment services because, to a large extent, associated fees still are
greater than or equal to the cost of mailing checks through the tried and true
U.S.  Postal Service.

The egg:  banks won't be able to drop fees any further until more merchants
are able to receive such bill payments electronically.  The irony of most
banks' electronic bill payment programs is that the bulk of payments made to
merchants are actually in the form of paper checks.  The only thing electronic
about them is that they were initiated electronically by consumers using
screenphones, PCs or telephones.

The vast majority of merchants lack the computer capabilities to handle
electronic payments.  Visa International estimates that nearly 60 percent of
"electronic" bill payments actually are converted to paper before they are
passed to merchants.  Bill Burchfield, CEO of Intuit Services Corp., which
handles bill payments for users of Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft's Money home
banking products, similarly estimates that 70 percent of the payments it makes
to merchants are in paper form.

Yet another egg (or would that be a chicken?):  Merchants as a whole are
unenthusiastic about electronic bill payment services.  Those not able to
accept electronic payments get a raw deal, because they end up receiving from
banks cumbersome lists of names and account numbers, accompanied by a single
check that represents many payors.  Generally known as a check-and-list, the
payment represents an exception item for the biller.

Merchants also are dragging their feet because they don't see enough consumers
using bill payment services.  Larger volumes, among other factors, would make
it worth their while to go electronic.  "Every merchant is interested in
moving to electronic payments, but most need to make [systems] changes to do
that," says Mark Johnson, executive vice president of Columbus, OH-based
Checkfree Corp., a leading electronic bill payment processor.  "We need to get
as much [consumer] volume as possible, so that the merchants see it's
worthwhile" to invest in the necessary systems upgrades.

Here's the good news:  Leading payment processors are aggressively pursuing
various strategies that should make electronic bill payments more palatable to
both billers and consumers.  Visa, for example, is tackling the back-end with
its introduction last month of an end-to-end electronic payment and remittance
system.  The Visa system will let billers easily accept more types of
electronic payments, without having to make large investments in new systems.
The bi-directional system even will make it possible for billers to deliver
bills electronically to consumers who want them.

Checkfree is also making major moves to increase the electronic element of
bill payments.  Checkfree's efforts focus on volume-specifically, boosting the
volume of consumers and small businesses using electronic bill payment
services.  With increased customer volumes, large billers should deem it all
the more worthwhile to invest in automated payment receptors.

Even smaller outfits are getting into the act.  An outsourcing service that
specializes in delivering bills electronically to biller endpoints is getting
a higher profile than ever these days.  Princeton TeleCom Corp., Princeton,
NJ, just signed on to provide $68-billion, Cleveland-based KeyCorp with bill
settlement and disbursement services for KeyCorp's newly introduced home
banking services.

Visa adds missing link

Visa collaborated with Dallas-based Sterling Software, a leading vendor of
electronic commerce and electronic data interchage software, in its attempt to
get more merchants into the electronic arena.  Sterling's financial EDI
product, Vector:Connexion, is a key element of Visa's ability to create a
fully electronic, paperless pathway from consumers, through their banks and on
to billing companies via billers' banks.

Sterling's Vector product has been available independent of Visa for a good
eight years, and is now installed at 41 banks.  To accommodate the increasing
flow of electronic consumer-to-biller payments, Sterling simply built a new
module to its Vector:Connexion product, which adds Visa's EDI format, TC09, to
the list of electronic payments it can make, such as ANSI X.12, 820, BAI
lockbox, flat file or customized formats.  The Vector:Connexion for Visa
module communicates payment information from billers' banks to billers via
direct connections, value-added networks, or the Internet.

"Now the huge Visa network, which so many banks are connected to, can feed
transactions to merchant banks," says M.A.  Hancook, manager, marketing
communications at Sterling.  "Merchant banks know that their paper-based
lockbox operations are going to go electronic someday.  What they're doing is
protecting their lockbox businesses, plus saving a lot of money because
they're not processing paper."

Visa also is striving to fill in yet another missing electronic link of the
electronic bill payment process.  Through Visa Interactive, a company formed
by Visa last year to offer PC- and screenphone-based banking, Visa will
provide electronic bill presentment.  In other words, no more envelopes.
Consumers will be able to receive their bills electronically via Visa's home
banking software.  Merchants will be able to transmit bills in a customized
format, complete with logos and marketing information, and also send returns
and corrections electronically to consumers.

Visa already is working with a number of banks, including Banc One, Barnett
Banks and Chase Manhattan, to take advantage of the commercial relationships
these banks have with billers, and get the electronic remittance product,
dubbed ePay, out in the market.  Financial institutions will do the honor of
distributing the application to their biller customers, giving them the
opportunity to add value-and sales revenue-to biller relationships.

NationsBank, for example, is using ePay to add to the cash management service
it already offers its biller customers.  "The biggest benefit is in the way we
can meet our customers' needs," says Ken Wood, vice president of emerging
technologies, NationsBank.  "Our biller customers are seeing an onslaught of
electronic payments coming [from front-end electronic connections to
customers], and they are fearing more paper payments coming through the back
end.  We expect this service to eliminate the chore of having to go through
the long lists of netted payments."

The $170 billion NationsBank signed up for the entire Visa package, including
Vector:Connexion.  Banks are not required to have Vector:Connexion to run
Visa's ePay; however, the set-up makes for more seamless interactions.  Wood
did not disclose how much the bank paid for the package, but said the price of
ePay is "competitive" with the automated clearinghouse and other back-end
systems.  "We have to be under the ball, ready to catch it for our clients,"
Wood says.  "By joining Visa, we're covering more of the outfield.  There are
other parts of the outfield, like ACH or [MasterCard's] Remittance Processing
Service, with whom we'll retain our relationships."

Bills, bills, bills

Checkfree is hoping to sweet talk more merchants into electronic commerce by
focusing on increasing volumes.  In one effort, Checkfree, like Visa, is
striving to electronically present bills to consumers.  In this respect, the
bill payment processor is potentially one step ahead of Visa, since it already
is involved in piloting electronic bill delivery to 500 consumers across the
country.  Participating billers include various telephone and utility
companies.  All of the participating billers are already equipped to receive
electronic payments from Checkfree.  Eventually, Checkfree will diversify its
trial to include credit card, insurance, newspaper and cellular phone
companies.  The goal is a controlled test of some 2,800 households, a fraction
of the customer bases of the participating companies.  When the service goes
live in the third quarter, it could extend to the companies' millions of
customers.

Checkfree sees electronic bill presentment as an important first ingredient
for more electronic bill payments.  "A lot of consumers aren't interested in
paying bills electronically until they can receive them electronically," says
Bill Kitchen, director of product development at Checkfree.  And for
merchants, electronic bill presentment cuts costs, and is more accurate and
timely.

Once the service goes full tilt, Kitchen expects the rest of Checkfree's
electronic merchants will want to get in on the action.  While the service is
de gratis during the trial, Checkfree might impose a per item charge to
merchants when it goes live.

Checkfree is just as busily mounting other efforts to build up the volume of
users of electronic bill pay services.  Recently, it teamed up with Automatic
Data Processing, Inc., Roseland, NJ, to launch a joint marketing program that
will target to small businesses PC banking and bill payment, payroll
processing, direct deposit and other services.  With only one percent of the
12 billion checks cut every year by U.S.  corporations processed
electronically, the potential to spur new waves of electronic bill payments is
huge.  "Small business owners use personal financial management packages at
home, and they want them for their businesses," notes Pete Kight, president
and CEO of Checkfree.  "It's almost criminal that we haven't delivered such
solutions to small businesses."

All in one

The emergence of companies like Princeton TeleCom is yet another hopeful
signal that electronic bill payment volumes are well on their way.  The
privately held company was founded in 1983 by a group of Princeton University
professors.  Originally organized to introduce a PC banking product, the firm
changed its direction in 1987 to focus on bill payments only.

The company specializes in addressing the needs of billers that receive
electronic bill payments.  A number of banks, the latest being KeyCorp, hire
Princeton TeleCom as an outsourcing service for settling and disbursing
electronic bill payments to billers.

"Princeton TeleCom is the only outsource that specifically concentrates on
electronic delivery to the biller endpoints," says Paul Ayres, Key Corp's vice
president for consumer electronic payments.  "We were searching for a partner
who fully understood the need for timely and accurate postings," to biller
remittance centers.

Princton TeleCom accomplishes this task through its flagship els Electronic
Lockbox Service.  With full electronic links to more than 450 billers,
Princeton TeleCom captures the overwhelming majority of payment items banks
now mail out to biller endpoints in the form of nettlesome "check-and-list"
disbursements.

At a set time each day, a file of all the day's transactions is sent into
Princeton TeleCom's main system.  "We go through that file and edit it based
on each biller's specifications about which account numbers are acceptable.
Once files have been cleaned, we sort them into files for each payee.  At that
point, each file is reformatted according to each payee's file specs," says
Martha Davis, marketing manager of Princeton TeleCom.  This process "gives
banks the ability to do customer service, to show their customers that they
are on the ball."

If a payee is not equipped to receive electronic payments, Princeton's Remote
Disbursement Facility prints out individual checks for each consumer payment,
rather than sending out net payments accompanied with a list of payers.  Net
payments "are very labor intensive.  If one of the payments on a bulk list is
wrong, they'll hold the whole list.  It's one payment per check with us.  This
way the quality of the check meets or exceeds the standards of the remittance
stub," says Davis.

The company encourages merchants to go electronic once payments reach a
critical mass, she notes.  Otherwise, the vendor can meet some non-electronic
merchants halfway if they have MICR scanners in their remittance centers.  In
that case, Princeton TeleCom can send payments to a scanning workstation at
the remittance center.  From there, payments are uploaded to accounts
receivable systems, processed and posted.  This is also the option for
electronic merchants not comfortable with the idea of an outsider sending
items directly into their accounts receivable systems, the method Princeton
TeleCom uses for merchants so equipped.

The whole electronic process takes place in a maximum of 48 hours:  two hours
for editing and sorting, and then it's just a matter of catching the billers'
15-minute "payment acceptance window."

Princeton's 2,000 bill payment originators include KeyCorp, Bank of America,
Wells Fargo, Boatmen's Bancshares, Fleet Financial Group, CoreStates, Premier
Bancorp Inc., Washington Mutual, Barnett Banks Inc.  and Union Bank.
Princeton charges billers 10 cents per transaction, while originators, such as
banks, pay 15 cents or less per transaction, based on volume.

The more that ideas to increase electronic bill payments get hatched, the more
that chicken-and-egg problems associated with the task will get smashed.

Electronic Money:  A Legislative Can Of Worms


A vast, unregulated terrain looms ahead as new payment methods-from smart
cards to stored-value cards to electronic cash-hit the marketplace.
Unfortunately, the current laws that monitor these fledgling products are not
new themselves.  Minute amendments aside, the most recent round of electronic
funds transfer rules were written at least ten years ago.  Today, new payment
technologies are stirring up a whole new set of regulatory dilemmas to be
dealt with, not to mention potential fraud pitfalls.

Industry experts and regulators are examining whether existing rules fit the
new environment, whether amendments must be written or altogether new
regulations drafted, and even more fundamentally, which entities have the
jurisdiction to regulate each of the new payment vehicles and write the laws
in the first place.

Fast action needed

Government higher-ups concede that swift action is necessary.  Recently,
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder told the House Subcommittee on
Domestic and International Monetary Policy, "Clarifying the legal and
regulatory structure that will govern electronic money products is one area
that may need prompt attention from both policymakers and the industry.  In
this case, failure of the government to act may, ironically, impede rather
than facilitate private-sector developments."

In the mind of at least one banker, one aspect of the coming regulatory
playing field is clear.  "Regulation should take place at the national level,"
says Robert Egan, vice president in Chemical Bank's legal department and a key
player in the Financial Services Technology Consortium, a national squadron of
banks, technology firms, consultants and universities working on various
technology projects.  "If you have to deal with local state laws on cards, it
becomes impossible to market a product that can go across state lines."  That
dynamic is especially important for Internet transactions, where buyer,
seller, bank, issuer and online server could all be in different states or
countries.

Egan raises another issue.  Cards jointly issued by groups of companies and
that carry multiple functions "result in an overlap of regulators."  Should
stored-value calling cards, for example, be regulated by the Federal Reserve
or the Federal Communications Commission?  "There needs to be some effort to
coordinate [who governs what]."

Few wheels in motion

So far, the only concrete action taken in this rocky regulatory arena is a
Senate proposal in October to exempt smart cards from Regulation E of the
Electronic Funds Transfer Act.  Led by Senators Robert Bennet (R., Utah) and
Richard Shelby (R., Alabama), the exemption would free card issuers from
having to replace funds on lost or stolen cards and from having to print
receipts for transactions, as stipulated by Reg E.

"With the new technologies, paper receipt generation is not always feasible,"
says Mike Shade, vice president of smart cards at VeriFone, Redwood City, CA.
The company is a key player in the SmartCash venture, a group of 11 banks and
various card technology providers creating the first stored-value card
business that will extend nationwide.  "Electronic receipts may be possible,
but certainly not in the form Reg E asks for.  One of the niches smart cards
are supposed to fill is the vending machine, and purchases of that nature.  It
would be difficult to generate receipts [for purchases of such small amounts]
in a manner that complies with Reg E."

One alternative to producing paper receipts for small-dollar, stored-value
transactions is to generate receipts only when loading value onto a card.
Ending the paper trail at that point would avoid the burdensome expense of
constantly generating paper for small-value purchases.

What about lost or stolen funds on smart cards?  "If I were to go to my bank
and withdraw $100 in $20 bills and then lose one of the bills, I can't go back
to the bank for a refund," notes Paul Seader, an attorney affiliated with the
law firm of Hughes, Hubbard & Reed, and who advises the electronic-cash vendor
DigiCash in New York City.  "But what's the status of an electronic cash
withdrawal in this regard, either via a smart card or the Internet?  These
issues need to be addressed in the contractual arrangements that underlie the
issuance of smart cards or electronic cash."

You say tomato, I say tomahtoe

Much of the regulatory discourse revolves around whether the new technologies
will be seen as resembling their physical world look-alikes, or as entirely
different from their predecessors.  Do Internet credit-card payments, for
example, fit into the current mold of rules for card transactions over the
phone and in retail outlets?  "I think regulators are beginning to change
their approach, to form new categories instead of forcing new technologies
into old categories," says Magdalena Yesil, director of marketing at Reston,
VA-based CyberCash, which is already shooting out encrypted credit-card
payments on the Internet.  "The Internet itself is going to be a whole new
category."

One innovation that appears to diverge sharply from its real-world counterpart
is ecash, Amsterdam-based DigiCash's Internet currency, which made its U.S.
debut on the Internet in October (see December BTN).

Dan Schutzer, vice president and director of advanced technology at Citibank
and director of the Financial Services Technology Consortium, throws out some
interesting questions:  "Will banks exchange ecash for currency, or will it be
the equivalent of currency?  If not, the value of ecash could fluctuate
relative to other companies' electronic money, to the dollar itself and to
other currencies."  And then Wall Streeters would start placing bets on ecash
exchange rates!

An oft-cited concern about ecash is whether a consumer has recourse if a hard
drive crashes, the ecash disappears, and it just so happens the owner did not
make a backup copy on disk.  Would Digicash or the issuing bank be held liable
to replace the ecash, or is the consumer out of luck?  In this case, if ecash
is equated with regular cash, the consumer is out of luck.  But if an
amendment declares ecash to be electronic funds, reimbursement would be in
order.

Digicash currently doesn't have a policy providing for reimbursement, although
it's working on one.  On its Web site (http://www.digicash.com), Digicash
provides this nebulous assurance:  "In case your computer were ever to break
down, if you had written down the secret random seed number you chose
initially when opening your account, future versions would let you use it to
recreate the coins and thereby obtain a free re-issue of the signed coins that
were lost."  St.  Louis-based Mark Twain Bank, the first U.S.  insitution to
issue ecash, notes on its Web site that losing ecash is like losing cash out
of a real-world wallet.  The bank advises consumers to only stash as much
money in the hard drive as one would in the wallet.

Square peg in a round hole?

Unspent funds on smart cards are the subject of numerous regulatory questions.
The funds could be subject to Federal Reserve requirements that 10 percent of
the floating amount be maintained in a non-interest bearing account against
the unspent funds, says Bob Ballen, partner at the law firm of Schwartz &
Ballen in Washington D.C.

For banks involved in smart-card initiatives, such a ruling "would certainly
have an impact on the earning power of those dollars," says W.  Doug King,
executive vice president of consumer credit services at Wachovia Corp., which
is participating in both the Visa stored-value pilot and the SmartCash pilot.
"But we have been faced with Reserve requirements on deposits forever."

In addition, floating funds on smart cards could affect the Fed's ability to
monitor monetary supply by distorting the perception of the amount in
circulation.  This could spur a call for disclosure regulation in the future.
"Having to disclose [floating funds on smart cards] would hinder our desire to
go into smart cards," King says.  In his view, however, disclosure is
unnecessary.  The Visa system, for example "is fully auditable," he says.
"All transactions are routed through a single settlement unit."

Unspent funds on stored-value cards could also fit into current laws governing
escheatment, or abandoned property, although these vary from state to state.
William Keenan, senior vice president of marketing and business development at
NatWest Bank in Delaware and chair of the legal and public policy subcommittee
of the Smart Card Forum, suggests that cards be confiscated if their value is
not used up after two years.  "But who would regulate that?"  Keenan asks.
"The Fed would argue that it should be the one.  Stolen cards, on the other
hand, can be deactivated through card readers."

The Mondex mystique

Once the industry settles all the regulatory issues related to unspent funds
on stored-value cards, it still will have to grapple with Mondex.  This
stored-value card, the brainchild of London-based National Westminster Bank,
is currently being piloted in Swindon, U.K.  If all goes well, the cards will
hit the U.S., Canada and Hong Kong next year.

Mondex cards work just like cash.  Card owners-be they two friends or a
customer and merchant-can transfer funds to one another without going through
a middleman.  Because Mondex does not have a central settlement mechanism,
many argue that it would be difficult to track how much money is changing
hands.

But Mondex's chief executive officer, Tim Jones, asserts, "Point-of-sale
terminals can remember everything they do, making Mondex more auditable than
cash.  It's not a fully accountable system [like some stored-value programs],
but still more so than [cash].  We are in discussions with U.S.  regulators.
They are doing a good job so far."

However, unspent Mondex funds may pose other problems.  "Somewhere, Mondex
dollars, either in a reserve amount or actual dollars representing it, is on
deposit and a bank is making lots of money on the float.  From the Federal
Reserve's standpoint, how do you keep an eye on the currency flow?"  asks
Henry Polmer, a partner at Bell, Boyd & Lloyd in Washington D.C., and legal
counsel to Electronic Funds Transfer Association.

Auditability is a key component of levying taxes, as well as curbing criminal
activity.  "Taxation is not at all difficult with stored-value transactions at
the point of sale," says Bernard David, director of marketing and planning for
the Smart Card Enterprise at DE-based Electronic Payment Services, a
participant in the Smart Cash enterprise.  "But with the anonymity of
transactions on the Internet, will taxable transactions be able to be traced,
as well as enforced by taxing authorities?"

A price for privacy

At the same time that banks face auditability issues with electronic money,
they also must deal with requirements of protecting customer information under
the Bank Secrecy Act.  The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to
report cash transactions of more than $10,000, as well as "suspicious
transactions," to federal law enforcement agencies.  "The cost of auditability
is a loss of privacy," notes William Binzel, vice president of government
relations at MasterCard in Washington D.C.  "Conversely, the cost of
protecting privacy is not being able to catch people who are doing laundering
or other illegal activities."

When larger chunks of money start changing hands on the Internet, rules and
systems may have to be set up to act as financial police.  For example,
digital signatures and other technologies could authenticate the parties to a
transaction.  Currently, Internet transactions veer toward the $10 to $100
range, which makes money laundering over the Internet as yet inconvenient.

That doesn't mean money-laundering Internet schemes and other crimes won't
crop up.  Stanley Morris, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN) of the Treasury, described the maladies that could plague the
Internet, in a recent hearing of the House Subcommittee on Domestic and
International Monetary Policy:

"Suppose my Internet user is a narcotics trafficker.  Consider the invoices
the trafficker might pay, the supplies he might order and the transactions he
might accomplish if, for instance, he could download an unlimited amount of
cash from a smart card to a computer, and then transmit those funds to other
smart cards in locations around the world-all anonymously, all without an
audit trail, and all without the need to resort to a traditional financial
insitution."

A scary proposition, indeed.  But unlike the woeful circumstances that
ultimately resulted in the formation of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and other regulatory agencies, industry experts say a Depression-like crisis
will not be a necessary impetus to establish electronic-money laws.  Says Egan
of Chemical Bank, "You hope the regulators will be sufficiently on top of
things so that when something [bad] happens they can have the tools to deal
with it."

Find The Bank:


Wachovia Bank recently unveiled the handsome design of the stored-value Visa
cards it will issue during the 1996 Atlanta Olympic games.  Most prominent is
the athelete at the top of the card, in dramatic motion.  Next, one notices
the Atlanta skyline.  Emblazoned at the bottom of the card is the Visa Cash
logo and the chip emblem.  Want to know which bank issued this bank card?
You'll have to turn the card over to find, finally, Wachovia's name at the
bottom.

A Card By Any Other Name...


It's all in the cards, or is it the name?  Major players in the bank-card
arena are realizing that the skillful naming of new card products has a hand
in their success.  The barrage of new bank-card options-from stored-value
cards, to debit cards, to multi-function smart cards-is increasing the
importance of effective naming.

Hence, Visa U.S.A.  has officially adopted the name "Visa Cash" for its
stored-value cards issued in the U.S., which are currently serving as cash
substitutes for purchases under $10.  The Visa Cash name and logo were
introduced last November in Atlanta, prior to its usage at this year's Summer
Olympic Games.  The prepaid bank cards operate with embedded computer chips
that store money as electronic data.

Visa's competitors have also opted for simplicity in naming their stored-value
cards.  MasterCard International has chosen "MastercardCash," while SmartCash,
the stored value card venture spearheaded by Electronic Payment Services Inc.,
will offer SmartCash cards.

While the naming of these "cash" cards is straightforward, consumers still
have to be sure not to confuse them with MasterMoney or VisaCheck cards.
Known by bankers as debit cards-since transaction amounts are automatically
withdrawn from accounts rather than prepaid-both companies nixed using "debit"
to describe such cards, due to its negative connotation with consumers.
MasterCard surveyed more than 5,000 customers before deciding on the
MasterMoney moniker for debit cards, further proof that the name can say it
all.

The Changing Physics Of Checking


Quiz those individuals with a stake in the business on their attitudes toward
checking and you're apt to receive a nearly universal response:  Checking is a
business undergoing colossal change.

"It's the new physics of banking," observes Dan Fisher, senior vice president
and cashier, Victoria Bank and Trust, Victoria, TX.  Industry consolidation is
the leading cause of change for the checking business today.  Fisher must
understand this fact first hand:  Victoria Bank, a $2 billion-asset bank,
situated in southeast Texas, about midway between Houston and Corpus Christi,
will soon become part of the Norwest Corp.  family of banks.  Norwest, a
multi-bank holding company headquartered in Minneapolis, tendered a bid for
Victoria Bank in November; the acquisition is expected to be finalized early
this year.

What is to become of Fisher's check processing shop once the acquisition by
Norwest is completed epitomizes the $64,000 question confronting bankers of
every ilk involved in the current consolidation frenzy.  No matter how
efficient a bank's check operation, experts note, it's difficult for an
acquiring bank to justify redundant check processing facilities because they
detract too much from the economies bank consolidations offer.  It's only a
matter of time before merged banks begin consolidating check shops.  "With all
of the merger activity we saw in 1995, we can expect to see consolidation of
greater check volumes into single check shops in 1996," predicts Stanley (Ned)
Miltko, senior vice president, Littlewood, Shain and Co., Exton, PA.

Miltko speculates that, at merging institutions, consolidation will throttle
the processes that support widescale implementation of new technologies, like
electronic check presentment (ECP) and image check processing.  "Technology
initiatives are going to have to wait to some degree for the consolidation
process to shake out," he says.

ECP, the equalizer

Clearly, there is a case to be made for ECP.  In the vernacular of many bank
operations executives, ECP is the great equalizer.  "ECP puts everyone on an
equal footing," explains Fisher.  "Distances don't matter anymore when you're
clearing checks electronically."  Nor does size; a small bank can present
checks with the same ease as its big bank competitor, provided each bank in
the exchange process is ECP-compatible.  "It levels the playing field," says
Fisher.

But there are many issues that must be resolved before ECP can begin to
fulfill its promise of widescale improvements in the efficiency of the check
clearing process.  For example, notes Miltko, in moving away from paper
presentment to a check clearing system that relies more on the exchange of
electronic files, banks will need to develop techniques for the integration of
back office systems, like accounting and statement rendering, with this new
check clearing model.  "It's not as simple as installing ECP receive software;
it's a whole reengineering of the back office that's required," says Miltko.
"That's really a tall order."

Today, ECP is almost always the electronic transmission of check payment
information in advance of the physical exchange of checks.  The idea is to get
a jump start on the processing of paper in hopes of identifying early in the
processing cycle items to be returned.  Clearly, if the paper check never had
to move-if it were truncated at the point of purchase or the bank of first
deposit-the hassles of reconciling paper and electronic presentments would
disappear.

Truncation woes

But check truncation brings with it an assortment of other problems.  Many of
the legal assurances that make the check a preferred method of payment in
America today simply don't translate into the world of the electronic check.
Banks need timely access to truncated checks, or at least to the images of
those items, to mitigate risks such as return item risk.

And then there is the matter of storage-where do banks stow all the checks, or
images of checks, that are truncated and converted to electronic items?  These
important questions must be answered before electronic check processes can
displace a significant share of paper check exchanges.

The Federal Reserve organized a panel of bankers and Fed officials late last
year in an effort to try and address these and related issues.  But before the
Fed's Advisory Group on ECP can begin to make headway, members will need to
agree upon a "common vision" for ECP, notes Paul Connolly, first vice
president, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and director of retail payment
products for the Federal Reserve Bank System.  "I think all of us would
benefit from developing a common vision for ECP:  ideally, a vision of
paperless collection of checks, and certainly of reduced reliance on paper; a
vision in which checks could be written by businesses and consumers, and then
collected electronically instead of by processing and delivering the paper
checks themselves," Connolly said in a speech to bankers last fall.

Not everyone is optimistic about ECP and truncation, however, even with the
Fed leading the charge.  One of the real sticking points, says Richard Ercole,
Huntington Treasury Management Co., Columbus, OH, is how you support
truncation at the point of sale.  The model most industry executives point to
relies upon the automated clearing house (ACH) to clear the electronic items
created from truncated checks.  And the National Automated Clearing House
Association (NACHA) has gone so far as to create a multi-industry panel, the
Electronic Check Council, to promote this approach to truncation.

But Ercole, who participates on the NACHA panel, says there are many legal and
regulatory issues that get in the way of truncation.  For example, once a
check is converted to an ACH debit, in today's world at least, it becomes
subject to Regulation E, the Fed's consumer electronic funds transfer
regulation.  Reg E, among other things, provides consumers with a 60-day
opportunity to rescind contested EFT transactions.

There also have been questions raised about whether or not consumers should be
required to authorize the truncation of checks tendered at the point of sale.
An initial test plan for POS truncation, involving only return checks, already
has been placed on the back burner because of questions such as these, Ercole
notes.  Any widespread implementation of check truncation at the point of sale
is probably a long way off, he suggests.

Trading in efficiency?

"Quite frankly, I'm not sure we can truncate checks at the point of receipt
without making the payment system less efficient," says Ercole.  "I think
either legislation or regulations are going to have to be changed, at least as
far as forward presentment is concerned."

Another contentious issue raised by truncation is storage.  Truncation of
lockbox items illustrates the situation aptly.  As image technology makes
inroads in lockbox operations, experts say the case for truncating checks
collected through lockboxes becomes even more compelling.  "What do you need
the check copy for if you can have the image of the check?"  asks Richard
Poje, a partner at Treasury Strategies Inc., a Chicago cash management
consulting firm.  But, then, who is to retain the images of those checks for
those situations when a payor or payee needs a copy of an item?

"The absence of an accessible, economic archive is a major impediment to
truncation on a broad-scale basis," says Poje.  To overcome this impediment,
Poje suggests bankers turn to the Fed.  "I think the Fed is the natural
provider" of check image archive services.  "They are the honest broker in the
business; the one party everybody trusts."

But how will the Fed get the images?  Today, only about one-third of the
estimated 63 billion checks written that are tendered for payment each year
clear though the Fed.  "The concept of a repository needs to be developed
around the whole clearing structure," says Jay Simmons, vice president,
Citibank.  "The Fed should be doing it for the items that clear through them."
But to forward to the Fed for storage those check images that are not cleared
through the Fed, would diminish many of the economies promised by truncation,
Simmons suggests.

The more appropriate role for the Fed in the evolution of electronic check
processes, Simmons says, is in rule writing.  As a regulator, the Fed can
implement rules that provide the assurances banks need to overcome the
shortcomings of ECP and truncation.  "I think that's their role in life," he
says.

Putting imaging in its place

And, what about imaging?  After years of promise, imaging has yet to make
major inroads into the labor-intensive proof-of-deposit function.  But imaging
is gaining favor for specialized applications, such as lockbox and return item
processing.  "To me, an imaging system focused on returns makes a great deal
of sense," says Simmons.  "It takes a lot of the risk out of the process."

During the course of a typical month, Simmons notes, a major cash management
bank might return between 4,000 and 5,000 checks that have been presented
against controlled disbursement accounts.  Sending those checks back through
the paper return cycle can take upwards of five days; transmitting images of
the items is a far quicker alternative.

One potential obstacle, Simmons concedes, is the current lack of imaging
standards.  Differences in the way the two major brands of check imaging
equipment-Unisys Corp.  and IBM Corp.-convert paper checks to electronic
images makes broad-scale image interchange an iffy proposition.

At least two groups-the New York Clearing House (NYCH) and the Financial
Services Technology Consortium (FSTC)-are working on projects to perfect the
use of images to support the check return process and check image interchange,
Simmons notes.  (Citibank is a member of both groups.)  If the FSTC and NYCH
projects prove successful, imaging could help the private sector chip away at
the Fed's return item processing business.

Today, the vast majority of check returns are routed through the Fed.  It's
largely a matter of convenience, explains Huntington's Ercole.  The Fed's
prices are such that it is often cheaper to send the Fed a mixed cashletter
than it is for a bank to sort the items itself.  Imaging, Ercole suggests,
makes it worthwhile for a third party, like a clearing house, to fine sort and
capture the images of checks for its members (or clients), thereby enabling it
to compete head-to-head with the Fed.

Online access to check images, he believes, could expedite the return process
by at least a day.  Ercole's parent bank, Huntington, is a founding member of
the National Clearing House Association (NCHA), which competes with the Fed
for nationwide check clearing business.  It's all in keeping with what bankers
like Victoria Bank's Fisher like to refer to as the "changing physics" of
banking, where the evolution of check products and services draws upon the
unlimited power of electronics rather than the physical limitations of paper.
"We have a system that is designed to deal with exceptions," explains Fisher.
"So why not create an image-based infrastructure for return items?"

The conversion of other paper-based check processes to electronics, suggest
Fisher and others, will just follow naturally.

INTERACTIVE BEAT


Will New Service Send Customers Out The Door?  Whether the newest feature to
be added to the interactive banking package from Online Resources &
Communications, Inc., McLean, VA, will be a boom or bust to banks is entirely
debatable.

Online's Interbank Transfer Service gives consumers an easy way to shop around
for the most competitive banking rates and electronically transfer money into
banks that offer the most attractive options.  At the same time, however,
consumers also have the ability to take money out of their banks more quickly
and easily than ever.  Whether a bank is on the winning or losing end of that
equation will determine just how much value they find in Online's new
offering.

"It seems absurd that banks would want to offer this service," says David
Stewart, consultant at Global Concepts, Inc., Atlanta.  "Obviously, it is
potentially damaging for banks that are looking to maintain and strengthen a
relationship with the customer."  In essence, banks are encouraging a "shop
around" attitude, Stewart says.  The only benefit may be if banks believe it
advantageous to offer as many options as possible, even at the risk of losing
business, he adds.

To use the interbank transfer feature, a consumer need only sign up (at no
added cost) for the service through an Online Resources client financial
institution that is marketing the feature.  Consumers can then access funds in
virtually any U.S.  institution from their home- or office-based PCs or
screenphones.  Three banks that are currently using the service include
Nationsbank, Comstar Federal Credit Union, Gaithersburg, MD, and Richmond,
CA-based Mechanics Bank.

"I'm not sure there's any way to ensure that funds won't leave your bank,"
says Alex Hart, vice president of customer access at NationsBank.  "But, the
best way to keep funds in your bank is to offer customers the services they
want."  As a service provider, Hart concludes that a bank needs to be focused
on offering the type of functionality and services desired by customers.  "You
should not be so proprietary to deny customers the conveniences they want
purely for defensive reasons," he says.

Online Resources contends that its new service feature is as beneficial for
banks as it is for consumers.  Says Lori Stewart, Online Resource's senior
vice president of marketing, the service is a "big benefit" for banks because
it is the first interactive way to transfer new funds into the bank.

12 Merchants Get Smart With First Union

First Union Corp.  is the first to announce merchant commitments to
participate in a smart-card trial during this year's Summer Olympics in
Atlanta.  The First Union Visa Cash card will be accepted by most of the
merchants as early as first quarter of the year.  Two other banks scheduled to
issue Visa Cash cards-NationsBank and Wachovia-had not announced any merchant
agreements as of November.

The 12 merchants signed up with First Union for the test launch include
Baskin-Robbins, BellSouth, Blimpie, Chick-fil-A, Communications Central, Crown
Central Petroleum, Domino's Pizza, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit
Authority, Pollo Tropical, Star Enterprise, Taco Bell and United Artist
Theaters.  According to First Union officials, several other merchants have
already signed letters of intent for participation.

The prepaid stored-value cards are available in $10, $20, $50 and eventually
$100 values, and may be obtained by anyone regardless of their bank
affiliation or credit history.  There is no fee to buy or use the cards, which
can be purchased with cash, credit or debit cards.  Omaha, NE-based Applied
Communications, Inc.  is providing the BASE24 software needed to load cash
value onto the First Union cards, which can be used wherever the Visa Cash
logo appears.

Visa is officially leading the smart card race in North America, with
London-based Mondex running close behind.  Mondex just announced a 12-month
pilot in the city of Guelph, Ontario scheduled for the latter half of this
year.  Mondex began piloting the system last July in Swindon, England and
reports usage by more than 8,000 consumers.  Plans are also underway for
additional pilots in the U.S., Asia and Europe.

Other competitors include Electronic Payment System's SmartCash (11
participants in this), which is expected to hit the U.S.  market sometime
later this year along with Mastercard International's MastercardCash, already
in circulation in Australia.  Even American Express is making sure it is not
left behind in the dust.  Teaming up with MCI, American Express Special Teams
is planning to market "integrated service" cards for stored-value applications
to college campuses in the U.S.  and abroad for a 1996 release.

All-in-one cards coming

By mid 1996, First Union will introduce reloadable stored-value cards.
Customers will be able to add cash value to the cards by using a First Union
ATM machine to access their checking or savings accounts.  The eventual goal
is an all-in-one card that will function as stored-value, debit and/or credit
card.

Next year, First Union plans to expand Visa Cash cards to other cities,
including the greater Washington, D.C.  area, Richmond, VA, and major Florida
metropolitan areas.  Major cities in North Carolina, South Carolina and
Tennessee are planned for 1998.

MasterCard Bounces Checkfree For Servantis

MasterCard International announced an alliance with Norcross, GA-based
Servantis Systems, Inc.  as part of several enhancements being made to its
MasterBanking program.  The Servantis alliance will eventually override the
existing agreement between Checkfree Corp., the Columbus, OH-based bill
payment processor, and MasterCard that began three years ago with the launch
of the MasterBanking program.  The enhanced MasterBanking program will be
available during the first quarter of this year.  MasterCard contends that
under a mutually modified agreement, the 50,000 MasterBanking customers whose
transactions are currently passed on to Checkfree will be converted over to
the Servantis system.  Full conversion is expected by mid 1996.

Dual role

"There is no problem with Checkfree, it's just a different choice of a
technology partner," says A.  Christian Frederick, MasterCard senior vice
president of remote banking and strategic planning.  "We wanted the dual
functionality offered by Servantis rather than just the bill payment option
offered by Checkfree."

The dual functionality Frederick refers to is Servantis' ability to offer both
home banking and bill payment capabilities.  The Servantis software allows
customers looking for simple, quick access to their finances to check
balances, transfer funds, pay bills and send and receive email messages to and
from their financial institution through Windows- and Macintosh-based
computers.  Servantis will market these products and services as Bank Street
Platinum.

US Order Delivers Smarter Phones At Lower Cost

Available at a cost of about $200 (down from $250), U.S.  Order's smart phones
not only got cheaper, they got smarter.  The Herndon, VA-based company
announced three new interactive features for its PhonePlus line of smart
telephones.

With the introduction of three features-EZPage text paging, EZPost email
service and FastFind visual directory assistance-PhonePlus smart phones now
have the capability to type and send full text messages directly to pagers,
send email messages via the Internet and receive nationwide directory
assistance information visually on the phone's display screen.  These three
applications add to its established functionality, which includes an interface
with Visa's electronic banking and bill payment service.  The screenphones
also provide a personal phone directory, visual caller ID and visual message
retrieval features.

Banc One, headquartered in Columbus, OH, and Memphis-based First Tennessee
Bank have both begun deployment of the Phone Plus Smart Phone while 18 other
financial institutions are planning to deploy the phones for technical
evaluation and trials.  Current PhonePlus customers will be able to download
the new applications directly from the US Order host computer.  New customers
can purchase the new smart phones through GTE and Sprint.

IRE Helps Secure Quicken Online

Baltimore-based Information Engineering Resources is providing Intuit Service
Corp.  with secure remote access products to protect electronic commerce
transactions.  The encryption equipment, now available through Intuit's
Quicken software, is packaged in a small, portable case designed for
convenient use in home banking.

Banks have been up and running with Quicken since Oct.  26, 1995.  The online
Quicken service enables consumers to bank, pay bills and perform other
financial tasks by dialing up their bank and downloading data directly into
the software, which then organizes consumers' records.

Founded in the early 1980's, Information Engineering Resources is a public
company that designs, manufactures and markets secure, encryption-based
communications systems.  The company reported revenues in excess of $4 million
last year, up 60 percent from the previous year, according to company
spokesperson Jill Leukhardt.

PRODUCT OF THE MONTH:  Shaping A Competitive Image


Shortly after First Commerce Bank of Georgia, $120 million in assets,
installed the PrimeImage Check Imaging System, bank officials had proof they
made the right decision.  With PrimeImage, the bank was able to detect a
fraudulent-check situation that would have resulted in a loss of $160,000.

"Since the system allows instant retrieval of the previous day's deposits, we
were able to substantiate a suspected kite, therefore saving us from a
substantial loss," says Randy Whitehead, group vice president.  "With
microfilm, there is no way we would have been able access our records as fast
to move on the situation."

The PrimeImage Check Imaging System from Carrollton, GA-based Greenway Corp.
is a Windows-NT based check and document imaging software system.  One unique
aspect of PrimeImage is that it utilizes a Redundant Array of Independent Disk
(RAID) system for online, magnetic storage of images.  The online RAID system
reduces statement preparation time by 90 percent over optical storage systems.

With PrimeImage, the front and back of each check and deposit slip is captured
by electronic cameras mounted on an image-enabled check reader/sorter and
transferred to a RAID system for high capacity, online magnetic storage with
fault tolerant safety.  The software system has the capability to assemble the
images and print up to 33 double-sided check-statement pages per minute in
check-number order.  Thus, it streamlines operations by simplifying the
check-sorting process and reducing the number of employees involved.

First Commerce Bank served as the beta site for PrimeImage.  Fully implemented
in June 1995, the system processes all checks for more than 10,000 First
Commerce accounts.  Whitehead points out that the bank has also prevented four
or five other potential losses since installing the complete system in August.
He concludes, "It really has been an excellent overall move for the bank in
terms of time, accuracy, staff productivity and customer service."

Banks using the PrimeImage software report that customers find the new
technology improves the way they balance their checkbooks.  First Commerce's
Whitehead says "customers love it" and reports a 99.5 percent satisfaction
rate with the new laser printed statements.

First National Bank of Griffin, $150 million in assets, installed the
PrimeImage system in November.  Prior to the system's implementation, the
Georgia-based bank conducted focus groups comprised of a variety of
professional and lay people to determine consumer opinion on the new
technology.  The overwhelming majority agreed the system was a quicker and
easier alternative to the "old" checking system.

Elderly customers, in particular, were especially appreciative of the easy to
understand statements, says Bill Homes, senior vice president at First
National Bank of Griffin.  With PrimeImage, checks are reduced to print-outs
that can be stored in a three-ring notebook provided by the bank.  "Our
customers are very comfortable and extremely pleased with our new system," he
says.

Other banks using the PrimeImage software include Moultre, GA-based ABC
Bancorp ($314 million in assets), which installed the system in December, and
Northwest Georgia Bank in Ringgould, GA ($180 million in assets), which will
be up and running with the system in February.

An Unbalanced Budget Burden


It's not easy being a medium-sized institution these days.  That's at least
one of the findings of an annual survey of bank and thrift
information-technology expenditures from Mentis Corp., Durham, NC.

The amount of money banks and thrifts of all sizes spent to purchase new
information systems, hardware and software reached $4.3 billion in 1995, up
from $3.7 billion in 1994, a 17-percent increase.  In addition to the $4.3
billion of capital invested in new technology, the industry spent more than
$20 billion on personnel, facilities, external services and other expense
categories associated with running existing systems and equipment.

Interestingly, the extent to which banks increased their capital investment in
technology differed greatly depending on the deposit size of the bank, the
survey found.  With consolidations roiling and churning the industry
practically weekly, such size-based spending suggests banks are using
technology as a tool to either defend, expand or control their turf.

Medium-sized institutions were the most aggressive investors in new technology
in 1995.  For many of them, potent technology-based strategies were the key to
maintaining their independence against ever-bigger banks encroaching on their
territory.  Mentis found that the segment with between $1 billion and $4
billion in deposits experienced an increase in capital IT spending of 41
percent, from $413 million to $582 million.  That hefty increase occurred even
as the number of branches these institutions own and operate went down (from
11,278 in 1994 to 10,765 in 1995).  By the same token, the segment of
institutions with between $500 million and $1 billion in deposits boosted IT
capital spending by 29 percent, from $184 million to $238 million, even though
they too, had fewer branches to maintain (5,765 in 1994 versus 5,107 in 1995).

When examined by branch, average technology spending for institutions with
between $1 billion and $4 billion in deposits increased by 48 percent per
branch between 1994 and 1995 (from $36,620 to $54,064 per branch).  For the
segment with between $500 million and $1 billion, such spending per branch
increased a 46 percent (from $31,917 to $46,603).  These stats lead to the
summary that medium-sized institutions may well be feeling the heat to compete
more effectively-either to keep up with large banks, or at least avoid being
taken over by them.  Clearly, banks and thrifts of this size are using
technology to pursue aggressive business strategies toward those ends.

Aggressive goals

One case in point, among many, is Centura Bank, Rocky Mount, NC.  The $5
billion institution is surrounded on all sides by some formidable big-bank
competition, including NationsBank, First Union and Wachovia.  Over the past
year, Centura has geared the bulk of its bank technology spending toward a
very specific, aggressive goal:  toward becoming the "money manager" of its
customers, says Tom Rogers, executive vice president.  Investing in technology
was virtually the only way to ensure the success of that strategy.

A month or two from now, Centura will wrap up a branch automation project that
should facilitate the bank's goal of better understanding customers' financial
situations, their needs and their profitability profiles.  Centura's
installation of Windows-based SellStation software from Ampersand Corp.  (now
owned by EDS Corp.)  at the teller and platform lines hooks into a customer
information system, from Customer Insight Co., Denver.  Customer Insight's
Analytix Software delivers customer information, including profitability,
directly to salespeople at the platform, helping them to gear product pitches
to the appropriate customers.

All of these systems and features at the platform are helping to build
business in the bank's new brokerage unit, which offers insurance and
investment accounts.  Rogers was not specific about revenues or new accounts
generated in this area, but relates that "from a business plan standpoint, the
new units are making very good progress."

For Centura, technology was the "tool chest" that helped make it possible.
Quite simply, Rogers says, "we need those [technology] tools to compete, and
to achieve our objective of being money managers."

Big banks reign in

Compared to medium-sized banks and thrifts, the biggest institutions spent far
less on acquiring new technology in 1995.  Banks and thrifts with more than $4
billion in deposits increased capital IT investments by only 17 percent, from
$2.3 billion to $2.6 billion.  The increase is even more modest in light of
the fact that the number of branches these institutions own and operate also
increased, from 33,942 to 35,222.

Many large banks and thrifts, having merged recently, are being sidetracked
from new-investment initiatives as they grapple with the huge jobs of
eliminating multiple information systems and paring overlapped branch
networks.  Of course, there's light at the end of the tunnel for these banks
and thrifts.  As these large institutions succeed in eliminating redundancies,
they should be able to redirect future IT expenditures toward capital
investments in new strategic initiatives.

Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank, to be officially combined as the largest
bank in the land come March, are in that limbo stage right now.  But with the
expectation of eliminating 12,000 positions, consolidating back-office systems
within three years, and saving $1.5 billion in expenses, the combined bank
should be in a position to invest in new technology before long.  The new
Chase is predicting a revenue fall within the first year of merged operation,
a year of break-even growth after that, and finally, revenue gains by 1998.

The objectives and experiences of small banks and thrifts turned out to be
altogether different from those of larger institutions in 1995, when it came
to investments in technology.  According to the Mentis survey, banks and
thrifts with less than $500 million showed a much lower growth rate in their
acquisition of new technology.  Those with between $250 million and $500
million in deposits spent 15 percent less investing in new technology (from
$229 million to $195 million) while those under $250 million increased their
technology expenditures by only 10 percent (from $598 million to $657
million).

These lagging trends in technology budgets make sense in light of the decrease
in the number of branches owned and operated by this segment of the bank and
thrift population.  Institutions with between $250 million and $500 million in
deposits now operate 728 fewer branches (6,767 in 1994 versus 6,039 in 1995),
while those with less than $250 million are dealing with 2,834 fewer branches
(28,425 in 1994 versus 25,591 in 1995).

Despite the overall decrease in technology investment for small banks and
thrifts, the Mentis study shows small institutions are nonetheless beginning
to invest in technology at a level that's on par with their larger brethren.
Mentis examined how capital technology expenditures compare to institutions'
non-interest expenditures-all those expenditures that support a bank's
operations and facilities, such as personnel and technology.

For banks and thrifts with deposits of more than $1 billion in deposits, 1995
capital technology expenditures amounted to 2.5 percent of total non-interest
expenditures.  For those institutions between $250 million and $1 billion,
capital technology spending was 1.9 percent of non-interest expenditures, and
for those with less than $250 million in deposits, it was 2.0 percent.

According to Dr.  James Moore, president and CEO of Mentis, the slightly
higher technology investments of larger banks as a percent of non-interest
expenditures is not a surprise.  "Economies of scale and consolidation in the
large bank segment allow a greater proportion of total dollars to go toward
acquiring new technology," he says, as opposed to managing the current
infrastructure.

The good news is that small banks and thrifts seem to be taking the challenge
of a lack of scale economies in stride, especially as advanced technology
becomes more affordable to them.  If small institutions can't spend as
aggressively as large ones, they at least seem to be spending wisely.  Take
tiny State National Bank of Big Spring, TX.  With $130 million in assets, the
bank has not let its small size get in the way of innovative ideas and astute
technology investments.

Busy, busy, busy

Its list of technology credits include just completing installation of a check
imaging system, developing a debit-card program through MasterCard's
MasterMoney offering, launching an electronic data interchange (EDI)
translation service and offering voice-response access to account balances.
Prior to these projects-most of which occurred in 1995-the bank was busy
installing a fully loaded local area network that runs Windows-based
applications for lending, account openings and other platform functions.  On
the agenda for 1996 is home banking.

Decisive moves

Robert Buckner, first vice president, can't yet quantify the payback the bank
has received, since most of the projects are just starting to have an effect
on customers now.  But State National is moving decisively to ensure its
investments pay off.

In just one example of moving swiftly to offer a service most large banks are
only now just dreaming of, State National will be delivering check images to
its fleet of networked PCs to aid customer service efforts.  Bankers will be
able to print out the front and back of checks in response to customer
requests.  And in a move that some institutions might think radical, State
National will charge a fee to customers who want paper checks returned, but
will offer imaged checking-account statements for free.

State National is not only thinking big, but is thinking creatively about how
to get good returns on technology investments.  Recently, it instituted what
could be a first:  a wake-up service brought to you by a bank.  Through its
voice response system, supplied by Regency Voice Systems, Inc., Dallas, State
National has rigged a wake-up service that sends out ring-a-lings to about 100
people every morning.  The message offers the time, the temperature and a
friendly "Good morning from State National Bank!"

The bank does not feel a need to charge a fee for such calls.  "We figure that
if the first thing you hear every morning is the name of our bank, then pretty
soon that's the only name that comes to mind when banking comes up," notes
Brunckner.

Flexible, free-form thinking like that, in addition to the ever-declining cost
of PC-based banking applications, will help small banks bring much-needed
efficiency gains to technology expenditures.

And once a much-needed calm to the industry's current consolidation frenzy
settles in, perhaps operating budgets will begin following a more steady,
consistent pattern across banks of all sizes

PRODUCT INTROS


For An Encore, Culverin Promotes Self-Service

Imagine customers who act as tellers for themselves.  Dayton, OH-based
Culverin Corp.  is doing just that, as it positions the self-service package
for its Encore!  for Windows application system as a labor-saving tool.
Recently, Culverin was acquired by CFI ProServices, Portland, OR.

The self-service package runs on a touchscreen-equipped PC.  With a card
reader and laser printer, customers can get account and product information,
print instant statements and run simple, non-cash transactions.  PINs maintain
customer security.

Although the self-service package can run independently of the Encore!
system, Culverin doesn't plan to market it as such, says Robert Feaganes,
marketing director.  The software package will probably cost $5,000 to $7,000
per workstation, he says.  Add the hardware required to run it, and the system
comes in priced at less than $10,000.  Culverin Corp., (513) 435-2335.


Signatures Go Digital

From time immemorial, signatures have been used to positively identify bank
customers.  With the ID-007, Atlanta-based Cadix International, Inc., brings
signature verification into the electronic age.  A pressure sensitive writing
tablet and Windows-based driver software make up the ID-007 system.

The ID-007 documents not only the shape of a signature, but also the pressure
and speed with which a person signs.  When first registering with the system,
a customer signs three to five times to give a large enough sample.  The
ID-007 software normalizes the signature and creates a 1.5 KB template.
Future signatures are compared to the template.  The system continues to
update the template with each genuine signature, as the template, like a
person's signature, changes gradually over time.

The system operates on either a local computer or over a network.  It costs
$250 to $1000 per unit, depending on desired features.  Cadix International,
Inc., (404) 804-9951.


Identix ID Points A Finger At Impostors

Identix, Inc., of Sunnyvale, CA, began shipping its TouchSafe II Fingerprint
Identification Terminal, which provides a physical method of verifying
personal identities of customers and computer users.

The TouchSafe II consists of two elements.  The first is a fingerprint scanner
"about the size of four average mice," says Anna Stockel, Identix's director
of fingerprint identification products.  The scanner connects to a standard
PC-mounted card.

The company using the system creates a database by scanning the fingerprints
of people it will wish to later identify.  The Identix system creates and
stores digital templates for these fingerprints.  To positively identify a
person, the system creates a second template from a new scan and compares it
with the old template.

Stockel emphasizes that unless the system is specially ordered, fingerprint
images cannot be generated from templates.  This lack, she says, helps calm
customers or users who fear their fingerprints, after they are scanned, will
be compared to law agency records.

Stockel declined to give price information on the Touchsafe II system.
Identix, Inc., (408) 739-2000.


Budgeting Service For Check Customers

For businesses and families on a budget, every check written is important.
Banks using Budget Master software, a product of Wausau Financial Systems,
Inc., can deliver to their budget-conscious customers statements that
categorize cashed checks into various budget areas.

Banks with Budget Master software issue special budget checking accounts.
Checks for these accounts are imprinted with 21 to 35 special symbols, created
by OnTRACK Management Systems, Inc., Downey, CA.  When writing a check, a
customer marks one or more symbols for budget categories into which the
payment falls.  At the bank, these check categories are keyed in along with
the other check information required to process a check.

Wausau, based in Mosinee, WI, also plans to release an image capture version
of the software, says Joe Gregory, product development manager.  The software
price varies depending on a bank's assets, from a minimum of $20,000 to
$125,000 for a $2 billion bank.  Wausau Financial Systems, Inc., (715)
693-5560


UCC Software Prevents Costly Filing Mistakes

A program from Librasoft, Inc., significantly reduces the risk of clerical
errors that might endanger a banks' legal protection under the Universal
Commercial Code (UCC).  UCC Control, a Windows-based program, automates the
completion of the more than 177 varieties of UCC forms.

Santa Fe, NM-based Librasoft developed UCC Control to automate data entry and
track compliance with UCC filing regulations.  UCC Control recognizes
incongruities in data and notifies users of impending filing lapses.

Form update disks for the program are provided quarterly under an arrangement
with UCC Filing Guide.  A single-user package costs $2,495.  Novell network
versions are available.  Librasoft, Inc., (800) 922-4988.


Toolkit Eases Transition To Mortgage EDI

Lenders using FiTECH Lending's Mortgage Lending system will be able to create
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) interfaces on demand using the Greensboro,
NC, company's EDI Tool Kit.

The kit, priced under $10,000, gives lenders the ability to communicate with
multiple vendors that support the EDI standard.  Lenders using EDI improve the
timeliness of business transactions, eliminate redundancy, reduce paperwork,
improve business workflow, reduce processing errors, streamline operational
costs and provide access to additional services.  FiTECH Lending, (800)

Visa Pushes Non-Duality For Internet Purchases


The World Wide Web of the Internet is a whole new world, right?  Visa U.S.A.
sure seems to think so.  Recently, the bank card association staked out a
strikingly bold claim in the still-developing world of Web commerce.

Visa announced it will collaborate with Sony Corp.  of America to build a
slick entertainment- and information-rich Web site-one that will take
advantage of Sony's multiple strengths in filmmaking, music, television,
radio, consumer electronics and video games, among others.  The site, dubbed
Sony Station, will be available for access in spring 1996.  Web surfers will
be able to access loads of new content that Sony is developing for this
medium, such as interactive tours with bands, live dating games and
information sessions with audio experts.

Visa's role in this venture is to act as the exclusive processor of secure
payments and micropayments for those who purchase entertainment or other
products from the Web site.  Visa's bold move excludes other brands of debit,
credit and chip cards for use on the Web site.  In other words, consumers will
not be able to use MasterCard or other card brands to make Sony Station
purchases.  In essence, Visa is attempting to create a new model for Internet
payments where duality-the accepted practice of having issuers and merchants
offer and accept multiple brands of bank cards-is a no go.

"Visa's going in the wrong direction," says David Weisman, analyst at
Forrester Research, Cambridge, MA.  "It's an attempt to say Visa has the only
secure payment system for the Internet, which it doesn't.  Now is not the time
to be staking territory."

Visa's attempt to create a non-dual world on the Internet harks back to its
announcement last September that it had established a secure transaction
protocol for Internet payments.  The announcement caught the industry by
surprise because Microsoft, not MasterCard, shared the podium with Visa.
Prior to the unexpected revelation, Visa and MasterCard had said publicly that
they were collaborating on a single standard for secure Internet transactions.

During the press conference announcing Sony Station, Carl Pascarella, Visa's
president and CEO, said that the differences between the Visa- and
MasterCard-led secure Internet protocols were "minimal."  He added, "We're
working on fast convergence of the standard."

However, resolution of the standard will not change the way transactions occur
on Sony Station.  "Resolving the standard will accelerate acceptance of
commerce on the Internet," said Pascarella.  "But it won't change Visa's
position on Sony Station.  Visa will be the only accepted card."

Microsoft Makes Big-Bank Inroads With NT Servers


A number of financial big leaguers recently pledged their allegiance to
Microsoft's Windows NT as their server operating-system of choice for some of
their more mission-critical applications.  The list of high-profile
institutions to sign up with Microsoft toward the end of 1995 includes
Citicorp, Merrill Lynch & Co.  Inc., Charles Schwab & Co., KeyCorp, Crestar
Bank and Sanford C.  Bernstein & Co.  Inc.

Most of these firms are employing Microsoft Back Office, a set of
next-generation business applications for NT servers.  According to Microsoft,
shipments of the Windows NT Server increased 70 percent between the first and
second quarters of 1995.  Even so, Windows NT, which hit the market in 1993,
still has a long way to go to catch up to the financial-services market share
of server operating-systems currently owned by Novell's NetWare network
operating system, according to a 1995 survey by The Tower Group, Wellesley,
MA.  Windows NT represented only 18 percent of new server operating-system
purchases by banks in 1995, compared to the whopping 52 percent represented by
Novell NetWare.

However, that 52 percent represents a harsh loss of share for Novell, because
it is down significantly from 1994's 72 percent, according to Tower.  NT's
18-percent share, meanwhile, represents dramatic momentum, up from only two
percent in 1994.  Through all this, IBM Corp.'s OS/2 LAN Server maintained an
even 20-percent market share in 1994 and 1995, according to Tower.

Many of the applications being put on Windows NT these days are considered
mission-critical.  New York-based Citibank, with more than $250 billion in
assets, will be rolling out more than 10,000 machines grounded in NT over the
next three years.  The bank will develop its future line of ATMs, in-branch
kiosks and staff workstations on Windows NT.

The $14 billion Crestar Bank, Richmond, VA, also is putting NT to work in
branch automation.  Crestar had been using Bankpro branch automation software
from Dallas-based Argo Data on OS/2 operating systems at all of its branches.
When Argo announced that it would make Bankpro available on Windows NT,
Crestar agreed to be one of the beta test sites for the NT version.

"Many of the other local area networks operating within the organization are
predominantly Microsoft and Novell-based solutions," explains David Holman,
senior vice president and manager of branch operations at Crestar.  "If we are
able to run the mission-critical branch automation on Microsoft, we will have
made a significant step forward in achieving increased compatibility between
operating systems across corporate LANs."

Cleveland-based KeyCorp, with $68 billion in assets, began piloting Windows NT
for branch automation at four branches in Columbus, OH, last September.  By
the end of October, the Columbus branches had a total of about 18 workstations
equipped with NT running Olivetti Corp.'s Mosaic OA branch management
software.

By the end of 1996, full functionality will be realized in 200 KeyCorp
branches.  Ultimately, the NT system will run database marketing programs,
interactive video banking kiosks, telephone banking services, enhanced ATM
functionality and smart card services.  Says Janet Malecki, vice president of
Key Services Corp., the move is part of the institution's "First Choice 2000
Strategic Initiative," a set of goals for the turn of the century.

Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, will implement Windows NT on all its 700 branch
servers and 25,000 desktops.  Sanford Bernstein & Co.  already has migrated 25
servers and 400 workstations to Microsoft Back Office and plans to migrate its
remaining mainframe-based applications, such as portfolio accounting and
analytical modeling, to the Windows NT Server.

HP Dresses Up Teller Windows At Wachovia


Microsoft's Windows NT is not the only high-powered operating system making
its way into bank branches.  At Wachovia Bank, Winston-Salem, NC, Hewlett
Packard computers will automate teller windows at some 500 branches in North
and South Carolina and Georgia.  Wachovia plunked down $30 million on the
intelligent HP workstations and the AT&T GIS servers that will feed them.  On
the platform side of branch operations, Wachovia uses IBM workstations running
OS/2.  Previously, the bank used an IBM 4700 configuration in its branches and
in other areas.

William Scales, Wachovia's manager of computing and network services justifies
the huge investment as part of a long-term strategy.  "We've put in a base
platform that will give us a lot of flexibility in the future," he says.  The
terminals could soup up customer service and rev up cross selling at the
teller location, for example.

The HP implementation is also an extension of an ongoing relationship with the
Palo Alto, CA-based computer vendor.  HP workstations and servers automate
Wachovia's bond trading, investment operations, auto finance and
asset-liability management departments.  HP Openview, a network management
software, coordinates systems across the bank.

What Do The Meca Banks Know That You Don't?


Fleet Financial Group, First Bank Systems, Inc.  and Royal Bank of Canada may
know something the rest of the banking industry doesn't.  At a time when
Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft's Money are the bulls in the PC home banking
market, these three banks have bought ownership stakes in Meca Software, whose
Managing Your Money application holds, at best, about 10 percent of the
market.

"The banks that invested in Meca want to be able to offer a full-feature
personal financial management package that's bank-branded, so the relationship
is with the bank rather than with the software package itself," says David
Weisman, analyst at the Forrester Group, Cambridge, MA.  "With Quicken or
Money, the customer relationship is with the package, not the bank."

Besides displaying only bank logos, the Meca software allows banks to
determine which financial services to offer.  Banks also can choose from
various back-end payment systems processors.  "The cornerstone of the bank's
relationship with its customers has been the payment system.  And if you
believe that there's an opportunity to merge the payment system with Internet
commerce, then you would want to make sure that you were in control of that
payment system," says Paul Harrison, president and CEO of Meca.

"Canadianizing" home banking

Meca's flexibility has special appeal for Toronto-based Royal Bank, because
with Meca, it can easily "Canadianize" PC home banking.  Canada's currency and
financial regulations are not fully accommodated by US-oriented packages like
Quicken and Money, points out Dan Maceluch, a spokesman for the bank.  For
example, Canadian retirement plans are called Registered Retirement Savings
Plans, rather than 401(K)s, as denoted on US-made software, and are controlled
by a different set of laws.  Similarly, tax filings are conducted differently
and need to be molded within the software accordingly.

"We would also like to offer the software to the different subsidiaries of
Royal Bank, like Royal Trust, Royal Mutual Funds, RBCDS Dominion Securities
and Action Direct, our discount brokerage," notes Maceluch.  "You have to
create all of those interfaces.  It's not a matter of handing out boxes of
software to customers."  Royal plans on distributing the package for free, and
charging an as-yet undetermined monthly fee.

The three new Meca banks join San Francisco-based Bank of America, with more
than $215 billion in assets, and Charlotte-based NationsBank, with $169
billion in assets, which collaborated to buy the Fairfield, CT-based Meca last
spring.  Each of the five banks now owns 20 percent of Meca.  The ownership
ring is potentially open to a few more bidders-although Harrison asserts he
doesn't want too many owners.

Others cluing in

Ultimately, Meca will offer and tailor the product for non-owner banks.  Other
plans include rolling a wider range of services onto the application, such as
brokerage, loan origination, insurance, and even travel tickets and catalogs.
The three banks' versions of the application will begin appearing on the
market the first half of this year.

These banks are "not the only ones" cluing in to the importance of branding
financial software, says William Randle, director of marketing and strategic
planning at Huntingon Bancshares, Columbus, OH.  "Our view of the future is an
electronic gateway that says 'Huntington.' Microsoft and Intuit have different
views," he asserts.  Randle has faith that "most banks will take action to
protect their customer relationships, so the brand in front of the customer is
their own.  The advantage banks have is they currently own the customer
relationships."

AOL, Intuit Pave Yet Another Electronic Path


Now that Intuit, Inc.  and America Online, Inc.  have joined forces to provide
online electronic banking services, consumers have one more entry into the
evolving world of home banking.  The strategic alliance between the two
industry leaders opens the door to electronic banking for the millions of
America Online members.  At the same time, it creates yet another product
detour for consumers en route to banks.

AOL subscribers will have point-and-click access to financial services
including checking, savings, money market and credit card accounts-as long as
these accounts are located at banks participating in the new AOL service.
These banks will charge fees independent of the AOL subscriber fee.

Providing AOL access will be easiest for banks already offering electronic
banking services via Intuit's Quicken.  For these banks, no additional
equipment or programming will be necessary-a single connection to Intuit
Services Corp.  will give these banks the ability to communicate
electronically with the eight million Quicken users and the four million AOL
members alike.

However, experts caution the potential hazards of banks engaging in such an
offering.  "It's a double-edged sword," points out David Weisman, an analyst
at Forrester Research, Cambridge, MA.  "It's a tempting place to be because
Intuit and AOL have such great target customer bases."  But, as more banks
sign on to offer their products through AOL, "you run the risk of becoming
just another computer icon within someone else's financial powerhouse."

Will banks go for it?  "We won't be jumping on this," says Doug Haynes, senior
vice president at $5.1 billion Centura Bank, Rocky Mount, NC, which offers
both Quicken and Microsoft Money to its customers.  "Obviously AOL is one of
the more popular online service providers.  So it's certainly something we'll
be looking into down the road."  Haynes adds that the bank is too busy right
now focusing efforts on its recent rollouts of Quicken and Money.

One more option

First National Bank of Chicago, another adopter of both Quicken and Money, is
investigating the AOL/Intuit service.  "Right now, we can say to our
customers, 'If you don't like Quicken, you can use Microsoft Money' or vice
versa," says Tom Kelly, spokesperson.  "If we were to sign on with AOL, we
would then be able to provide one more option to our customers."

According to Linda Parker, senior vice president at US Bancorp, Portland, OR,
the AOL/Intuit product description is "very attractive."  The real advantage
for banks, she says, is the potential to tap into a customer segment
unreachable through personal finance software.

The collaborative electronic banking service is expected to be launched during
the first half of this year for Windows users and by the end of the year for
Macintosh users.  Nevertheless, no financial institutions had committed
themselves as of press time.

Prior to the alliance, the Vienna, VA-based online service provider had only
one other online banking service agreement, with Bank of America, which had
established a site on AOL's Personal Finance channel last year.

New Directions EDS, The Exchange Create New Network


EDS and The Exchange regional network are splitting ownership of a new
enterprise, TransAlliance, that will offer electronic funds transfer services
to institutions in the western U.S.  and western Canada.  The alliance
combines The Exchange's more than 300 members with EDS' two EFT network
operations for a total initial customer base of about 700 financial
institutions spanning 13 states and four provinces, with 9,000 ATMs, and
annual revenues of about $50 million.

The bill of fare will include ATM, point-of-sale and interbank transaction
processing, and eventually home banking and electronic bill pay transactions.
Multimedia-based ATM transactions are a possibility as well.

Transactions will be processed on a new platform, called EON, just introduced
by EDS to satisfy requirements for greater uptime and availability.  Denny
Dumler, president and CEO of Visa International's Plus national ATM network,
was named president and CEO of the new enterprise.

Mellon Offers Corporate Cards With A Twist


Company handouts to employees are taking on a new twist with a corporate ATM
card being offered by $38-billion asset Mellon Bank.  The card lets employees
access compensation and incentive funds from special accounts whenever they
feel like it.  And, it reduces costs for employers, as it replaces paper
checks or certificates, and leaves the processing of ATM and debit
transactions to Mellon.  The Pittsburgh-based bank will custom design the
cards according to firms' specifications.

Going Where No Card Reader Has Gone Before


Gamblers beware.  Off-track betting could end up in consumers' living rooms
through a pilot combining at-home point-of-sale terminals and interactive
television simulcasts of horse races.  This project is one of many that Morris
Plains, NJ-based ISED (International Secure Encryption Devices) is pursuing,
as it attempts to establish applications for a new low-cost point-of-sale
terminal that secures debit and credit card transactions initiated in the home
or small office.

ISED's horse-betting venture with Tulsa, OK-based On Demand Services, a
partner of Churchill Downs, organizer of the Kentucky Derby, typifies the sort
of in-home POS service that ISED is hoping to make mainstream.  Gamblers will
be able to place bets on interactive-TV race simulcasts by swiping cards
through ISED's Secure Encryption Devices and making online or offline debits.
Other ultimate uses for the devices will be to facilitate the $40 billion
worth of home-shopping purchases currently made by consumers via telephone
each year.  Using the secure terminals to transmit home-shopping orders offers
far more privacy and security than reciting one's credit card number over the
phone to a customer sales representative.

$75 a pop

"The little box replicates an ATM in every sense of the word except that it
doesn't dispense cash," says Joseph Favole, vice president of ISED.  At $75 a
pop, ISED is hoping to become the first company to make secure card payments
via telephones and PCs a reality for consumers at home.  The terminals use
regular phone jacks to plug into telephones and modems.  Another version of
the gizmo fits into the keyboard port on a PC.  From these easy access points,
ISED taps into the might of the ATM and credit card networks, allowing secure
online and offline debit and credit transactions to occur from home.

Before reaching the mass consumer market, however, ISED is first targeting the
small merchant market.  ISED estimates six to seven million small merchants
still accept only cash or checks because they deem the POS terminals available
today as expensive barriers to electronic transactions.  Not only are the less
expensive Secure Encryption Devices an inducement for such merchants, but by
getting rid of paper, the typical 2.18 percent interchange rate and $.10
per-transaction fee drop to an interchange rate of 1.3 percent and no fee.  At
least 800 Secure Encryption Devices are already in action at merchant sites,
and there's a huge back order on the little machines, according to Hilary
Thomas, president of ISED.  Thomas hails from a prior post as president of
Minitel USA, a subsidiary of France Telecom, which distributed screenphones
throughout France a few years ago.

Rutland, VT-based Chittenden Bank, $1.2 billion in assets, is the first bank
to test the Secure Encryption Devices.  Daniel Alcorn, senior vice president
of Chittenden's retail credit division, expects the terminal "will enable us
to get more merchants, independent sales organizations and agent banks as
customers.  It's a low-cost solution to paper processing, and a low-cost
entrance into electronic processing, including debit."

Alcorn predicts a surge in merchant processing revenues, thanks to the
low-cost competitive edge the Secure Encryption Devices provide.  "If we
brought in merchants each with an average transaction rate of $10,000 a month,
and we signed on a thousand merchants, that's $10 million a month.  The margin
on that business is usually .0025.  You make $25,000 a month in net pretax
margin, which is $300,000 a year before taxes.  We think we'll be able to
attract at least that many new customers in one year," Alcorn says.

Merchant to supplier

Once the Secure Encryption Devices make headway in the small-merchant market
as low-cost POS terminals, ISED plans to market them as devices merchants can
use to facilitate purchases from their suppliers.  "These first two phases are
happening now," notes Favole.  Finally, the devices will enter into consumer
homes, supplied by merchants through customer loyalty programs, and ultimately
sold to consumers by software companies.

ISED is adopting a different terminal deployment strategy from that of
VeriFone, which recently announced a plan to enable consumers to make payments
from home using PC-based software called Pay Window.  Under VeriFone's scheme,
a device will marry point-of-sale terminals, called Payports, to consumers' PC
terminals.  The solution will let consumers use credit and debit cards,
electronic cash and electronic checks to make Internet purchases.  The plan
includes payment software for merchants and acquirers, and Gateway software to
tap into existing payment and clearing infrastructures.

To pull this off, the Redwood City, CA-based vendor is tapping the resources
of its recent acquisition, Enterprise Integration Technologies of Menlo Park,
CA, which specializes in software and consulting to get companies rolling with
electronic commerce, and Cybercash, Reston, VA, a key player in payment
systems on the Internet.  VeriFone's Internet payment architecture is
scheduled to hit the market in six to nine months.

Flawed strategy?

In the view of VeriFone, ISED's strategy of reaching out to small merchants
may well be flawed.  "Eighty percent of merchants who can afford debit
transactions are well equipped at this point," says Mohammad Khan, director of
marketing at VeriFone's Internet Commerce Division.  "There are only a few
merchants left who don't have electronic card readers, and that merchant
segment is not interested in debit cards at this point."

ISED, nonetheless, is forging right ahead.  "Right now, we're encrypting the
PIN" for ATM and debit card activity, says Favole.  "We can also encrypt the
magnetic stripe information, but we're not doing it yet.  Regulations don't
require encryption for credit card transactions yet.  But in the event that
Visa and Mastercard start offering banks lower rates for encrypted
transactions, we are ready."

A further security measure waiting in ISED's wings is the creation of
one-of-a-kind public and private keys for every missive.  Processors of the
Secure Encryption Devices will be called upon to create and maintain master
keys for security purposes.  Processors of the banks and merchants that deploy
devices to the consumer will have the ability to recognize transactions from
"foreign" Secure Encryption Devices, much like bank ATM processors today
recognize and route foreign ATM transactions between banks.  For example, a
merchant or bank's Secure Encryption Device processor will request a working
key from the processor of the consumer's deployer.  A single-use-only working
key, encrypted under the master key, will be sent back directly to the
consumer's Secure Encryption Device within seconds.

Backed by Electronic Data Systems, ISED congealed some three years ago with
the goal of bringing the Secure Encryption Device to market.  EDS' involvement
in the privately held ISED is strictly financial, and the monetary stake has
not resulted in the Dallas-based company becoming the sole processor for the
ISED terminals.
