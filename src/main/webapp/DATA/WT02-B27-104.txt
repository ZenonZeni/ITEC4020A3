Flavell (1976), who coined the term "metacognition, "referring to cognition
about cognition, defined metacognition as "knowledge concerning one's own
cognitive processes and products or anything related to them...[such as]
active monitoring and consequent regulation and orchestration of these
processes" (p. ???).<BR>
<BR>
Schoenfeld (1987) elaborated on this definition by explaining that metacognition includes the following processes:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> awareness of cognition and cognitive strategies -- knowledge about one's thinking<BR>
<BR>
<LI> control or self-regulation of cognitive processes -- how well one keeps track of what they are doing<BR>
<BR>
<LI> beliefs and intuitions about the task at hand -- what ideas or attitudes one brings to the task (beliefs that math is impossible, or Shakespeare is beautiful, for example)

<BR>
Various authors have used different terms to describe different aspects of
metacognition, including:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> metamemory -- knowledge about and regulation of memory states and processes. An example of this would be a student's knowing that they will recall information better on a test if they study in the same room as the test, use of mnemonics to help remember information<BR>
<BR>
<LI> metacomprehension -- used to describe monitoring of one's comprehension, also referred to as self-monitoring for comprehension. An example of this would be someone realizing that they are not fully understanding something they are reading. An analogous process could be realizing that a math answer is incorrect (such as computing a sine of 1.2)<BR>
<BR>
<LI> meta-attention -- controlling and regulating one's attention. An example of this is selectively ignoring task-irrelevant stimuli, and focusing attention on relevant stimuli. This could also be broadened to include knowing when one's attention has wandered from the task, and using strategies to keep one's attention on task, such as talking out loud to oneself or structuring the environment to be conducive to attending to the desired stimuli (turning off music while studying, perhaps).<BR>

Does the concept of an executive controller sound familiar? It should if you've studied the history of psychology. Click <A HREF="MetaHist">here to see some information on historical antecedents</A> of what Flavell described as metacognition.<BR>
