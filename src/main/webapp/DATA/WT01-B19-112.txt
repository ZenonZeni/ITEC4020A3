<div align="CENTER"><font size="-1" face="Arial"><b>WATERLOO</b></div><br>
<div align="left"><spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15"></font>Allen
Helmers sits rigidly on cement steps that lead to the front porch
of his weathered, white duplex on the city's east side.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Just above his head, a pair of
skinny cats lounge behind the screened windows, eyes closed, ears
twitching to pick up even the smallest sound from the street.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Helmers adjusts his black reading
glasses and shifts his weight uncomfortably.&nbsp; It's a little
after 1 p.m., and he's hurting.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I can't sit like this very
long,&quot; he says.&nbsp; &quot;Pretty soon, I have to recline
or lay down or it starts killing me.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Before he reclines, Helmers, 48,
will fill a small pipe with marijuana and inhale deeply.&nbsp;
His doctor says it's the only thing that effectively relieves the
throbbing pain of fibromyalgia syndrome, which attacks the body's
soft tissue.&nbsp; Neither cause nor cure is known.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Seconds after his fourth
&quot;hit&quot; of the day, the pain in Helmers' back and legs
will begin to subside, and he can think about something else.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Like spending as much as 10 years
in prison.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;If they send me into the
system, I'll be one hell of an expensive prisoner,&quot; he
says.&nbsp; You know, disabled people have rights, too.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Helmers survived a semi roll-over
in 1983 that left him with a broken back.&nbsp; In 1994, he was
hit by an uninsured drunken driver while riding his motorcycle,
resulting in an ugly mass of purplish zipper scars crisscrossing
his lower left leg, where the flesh has been stretched
haphazardly over repaired bones.</div><br>

<p>Man faces prison term for using medicinal marijuana</b></font> <br>
<font size="-1" face="Arial">Continued from page 1</font> <multicol
cols="3" gutter="10" width="100%"> <spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">But
six months before the second accident, on a cold February night,
police burst into Helmers' house with a search warrant.&nbsp; He
says they were looking for powdered methamphetamine, having
traced the drug to a man who rented the other half of the duplex.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">But the search yielded the 90 grams
(about three ounces) of marijuana Helmers had on hand to keep the
pain at bay.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I knew better than to have
that much at once,&quot; he says.&nbsp; &quot;Anything less than
44 grams would have been a misdemeanor.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Helmers stash cost him two
five-year prison sentences and $1,800 in fines and court
costs.&nbsp; The prison terms were suspended, and he was placed
on two to five years of supervised probation, which includes
periodic urine tests.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I didn't lie; I told them the
(tests) would be dirty,&quot; he says.&nbsp; &quot;I wasn't going
to stop smoking; I couldn't.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">His doctor, W.H. Verduyn of
Waterloo, says Helmers' pain does &quot;not seem to respond to
the usual medical management.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">According to Helmers, more potent
prescribed pain relievers have not only failed, hut caused
everything from stomach ulcers to impotence and memory loss.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;Marijuana gives me the best
relief from the pain and muscle spasms without the debilitating
side effects of the other drugs,&quot; he says.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">It even allows him the mobility to
mow lawns for elderly friends and give horseback rides to
neighbor kids.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Dr Verduyn, of Physical &amp;
Rehabilitation Associates of NE Iowa Inc., says he knows many
patients who use marijuana to reduce chronic pain, with the only
side effect being &quot;a significant reduction of the other pain
medications.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;It has been known in the
medical field, particularly in the area of rehabilitation, that
chronic neurogenic pain responds well to the medicinal use of
marijuana,&quot; he says.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Across the country, the same case
has been made for people suffering with AIDS, cancer, glaucoma,
epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and other maladies.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">But there are only eight people in
the United States who can legally smoke marijuana for medical
reasons.&nbsp; All were given permission - and are supplied the
drug - under a federal program that was shut down by the Bush
administration in 1992, two years before Helmers took a friend's
7-year-old son &quot;for a little ride on the motorcycle.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">It was 3:30 p.m., in the 1900 block
of Independence Avenue.&nbsp; The woman driving the car that
struck them was determined to be legally drunk.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;The bones came spraying out
of my leg, and I busted the bottom two vertebrae that still
haven't healed,&quot; Helmers remembers.&nbsp; &quot;The little
kid landed on my lap, he got a couple of stitches.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;We had an angel with
us.&quot;<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Helmers is hoping the angel will be
in the Black Hawk County Courthouse Sept. 16.&nbsp; That's when
he goes before a judge at a probation revocation hearing.&nbsp;
An unfavorable decision will send him to prison.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">But even if he's lucky, and
probation is continued, he won't stop smoking pot.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;In good conscience, if need
be I will do my time, but I don't and can't feel like a criminal
because I use a substance that enables me to at least function
part-time,&quot; he says.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">Not surprisingly, Helmers' plight
has come to the attention of Iowans for Medical Marijuana, and
his story has been posted on the Internet.&nbsp; A lawyer in
Philadelphia has reportedly offered his services.&nbsp; The
statewide group has invited Helmers to a rally at the state
Capitol on Oct. 6.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">If he's not in jail.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I will battle the best I can,
but I know if I'm locked up and deprived of my medicine, I'll go
downhill fast,&quot; Helmers says.&nbsp; &quot;I can only hope
that my suffering might somehow help someone else down the road.<br>
<spacer type="HORIZONTAL" size="15">&quot;I'm turning it over to the
Lord.&quot; </multicol></div> </p>
