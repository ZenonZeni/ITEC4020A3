    <H3>
      Why would I want to post a Class Action Notice on the Internet?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    The purpose of giving notice to absent class members is to assure procedural
    fairness and due process.
    <A HREF="http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23.htm">Federal Rule
    of Civil Procedure 23</A> instructs that the notice be the <STRONG>"best
    practicable"</STRONG> under the circumstances, including individual notice
    to members who can be identified through "reasonable" efforts. State rules
    of procedure, from
    <A HREF="http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/calaw.html">California</A> to
    <A HREF="http://tally.gulfnet.com/user_pages/fl_law/frcpcon.htm">Florida</A>
    to
    <A HREF="gopher://lbdc.senate.state.ny.us:70/00/.laws/Civil%20Practice%20Law%20%26%20Rules/.CVPA9">New
    York</A>, include similar requirements.<BR>
    <P>
    In addition, Congress recently enacted the
    <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.1058.ENR:">Private
    Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995</A> which provides for a
    <STRONG>special early notice</STRONG> in securities class actions to be published
    "in a widely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire service"
    advising members of the purported plaintiff class.
    <P>
    Posting a notice on the Internet may be one of the most cost efficient means
    of reaching millions of potential members. For the modest price of obtaining
    an Internet presence, a document can be posted and made <STRONG>continuously
    available</STRONG> to nearly
    <A HREF="http://www.openmarket.com/over/int_fact.htm">40 million</A> Internet
    users. And the number of users is expected to increase at least fivefold
    by the end of the century.
    <P>
    Courts have broad discretion in formulating standards for appropriate notice.
    Orders are now being fashioned which require Internet posting in addition
    to print media publication. As technology and society advance, notice by
    electronic distribution will become standard.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      OK, the Internet sounds good. But why post at www.notice.com?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Putting your notice on the Internet isn't enough. It needs to be positioned
    where individuals, who may be unaware that they are potential members of
    a class, might reasonably expect to look.
    <P>
    As of January 1996 <A HREF="http://www.webcom.com/~walsh/stats.html">over
    170,000 commercial domains</A> were registered on the Internet, representing
    an annual increase of 586%. Plus there are tens of thousands of academic,
    governmental and other organizational domains. Each domain may have within
    it an unlimited number of pages.
    <P>
    Every page or document on the Internet has a unique address called its
    <A HREF="http://www.matisse.net/files/glossary.html#URL">URL</A> (uniform
    resource locator). The various <A HREF="http://www.albany.net/allinone/">search
    engines</A> that are available on the Internet indexed an estimated
    <A HREF="http://thirteen.srv.lycos.com/sow/TrueCounting.html">19</A> to
    <A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">21</A> <STRONG>million</STRONG> or
    <A HREF="http://www.opentext.com/omw/f-omw-stats.html">more</A> URLs as of
    the beginning of 1996. And the numbers keep growing.
    <P>
    <B>Is it reasonable to expect that a posting on any page will get noticed?</B>
    <P>
    Class actions may cover a wide variety of subjects and may have national
    or international scope. The subject matters range from computer chips to
    polybutylene pipe, from corporate antitrust to consumer fraud. An action
    filed in Alabama may bind class members from Maine to Wyoming.
    <P>
    A central location on the Internet, not limited by considerations of geography
    or topic, is required. A site that not only is registered with all of the
    major search engines, but one where users would naturally expect to find
    a notice of importance.
    <P>
    <FONT SIZE=+1><B>That location is
    <A HREF="http://www.notice.com/">www.notice.com</A>.</B></FONT>
  <DT>
    <H3>
      How do I get my Class Action Notice posted at www.notice.com?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    There are four ways:<BR>
    <P>
    <STRONG>First</STRONG>, if you have a home site on the Internet, you can
    load the notice on a separate page at your site. Then send an email to
    <CITE><A HREF="mailto:legal@notice.com">legal@notice.com</A></CITE> with
    the URL of the notice page along with a 10-to-15 word description to go along
    with it.
    <P>
    <STRONG>Second</STRONG>, you might have the defendant in the class action
    post the notice at a special location at its home on the Internet. See,
    <CITE>e.g.</CITE>, <A HREF="http://www.intel.com/product/pentium/">In re
    INTEL PENTIUM(TM) PROCESSOR LITIGATION</A>, where the notice is posted at
    Intel's site. Again, send an email to
    <CITE><A HREF="mailto:legal@notice.com">legal@notice.com</A></CITE> with
    the URL of the notice along with a brief description.
    <P>
    <STRONG>Third</STRONG>, you might consider going to an independent service
    bureau who would put the notice on a separate page at the bureau's site.
    Again, send an email to
    <CITE><A HREF="mailto:legal@notice.com">legal@notice.com</A></CITE> with
    the URL of the notice location along with a brief description.
    <P>
    <STRONG>Fourth</STRONG>, we will load the notice for you onto a designated
    URL at www.notice.com ("Your-Notice-URL") and then post it. We will also
    keep you advised as to how many times Your-Notice-URL has been visited.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      How much does it cost?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    We post notices <STRONG>without charge</STRONG>. If we load the notice and
    create Your-Notice-URL (option 4 above), there are setup and maintenance
    fees for page development which vary based on the length (number of pages)
    of the notice, the processing required (<I>e.g.</I>, electronic file transfer
    or paper document scan) and the time period for maintenance.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Will you certify a posting?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    At your request, we will provide a certificate confirming the date that we
    post the URL of your notice. You may also request a certificate of continuity,
    confirming the continuous time period during which we have posted the URL
    of your notice.
    <P>
    Please note: Unless we have loaded the notice and maintained Your-Notice-URL
    (option 4 above), we will not be able to certify that the notice has actually
    resided at the designated URL. We can only certify that the URL which you
    designated (under options 1 through 3 above) has been posted and maintained.
    <P>
    There is a charge of $50 per certificate.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Exactly what will you post for free?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    We will post the complaint, proposed settlement, or other judicially approved
    notice document.
    <P>
    We will not post the entire docket file.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      Will you post a summary report of the litigation?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    Some law firms and organizations prepare descriptions of past or current
    litigation work. Such documents, while very informative, are treated as
    promotional material. We invite you to <A HREF="contact1.html">contact us</A>
    about advertising, paid postings and sponsorship opportunities.
  <DT>
    <H3>
      What about notice by email?
    </H3>
  <DD>
    We are unaware of any court that has permitted notice to class members by
    email in lieu of mail sent via the U.S. Postal Service or other delivery
    service. Notice by email would clearly provide an effective backup process,
    and we can provide that service. However, if you know the recipients' email
    addresses, then you really don't need us to transmit the notices unless you
    have administrative or legal concerns. We can also assist in
    <STRONG>locating</STRONG> email addresses for your prospective recipients.
