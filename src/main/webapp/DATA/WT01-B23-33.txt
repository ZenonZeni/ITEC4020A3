<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>II -- THE INDIAN OPIUM MONOPOLY </h2>

<p><img src="../../graphics/blueline.gif" align="bottom"

<p><font size="1">LET </font>us quote from another dry official
record, of unimpeachable veracity-the Statesman's YearBook, for
1916. On page 140<b>, </b>under the heading of The British
Empire: India and Dependencies, we read: &quot;Opium. In British
territory the cultivation of the poppy for the production of
opium is mainly restricted to the United Provinces, and the
manufacture of the opium from this region is a State monopoly. A
limited amount is also grown in the Punjab for local consumption
and to produce poppy seeds. In the monopoly districts the
cultivator receives advances from Government to enable him to
prepare the land for the crop, and he is bound to sell the whole
of the produce at a fixed price to Government agents, by whom it
is despatched to the Government factory at Ghazipur to be
prepared for the market. The chests of manufactured opium are
sold by auction in Calcutta at monthly sales. A reserve is kept
in hand to supply the deficiencies of bad seasons, and a
considerable quantity is distributed by the Indian excise
departments. Opium is also grown in many of the Native States of
Rajaputana and Central India. These Native States have agreed to
conform to the British system. No <font size="1">6 </font>opium
may pass from them into British territory for consumption without
payment of duty. </p>

<p>&quot;The bulk of the exports of opium from India has been to
China. By arrangements with that country, the first one being in
I907, the exports from India have been limited, and provision
made for the cessation of the export to China when the native
Chinese production of opium shall be suppressed. The trade with
China is now practically suspended.&quot; </p>

<p>The important things to notice in the above statement are
these: The growing of poppies, the manufacture of opium, and the
monthly auction sales continue. Also, the opium trade with China
is practically at an end. The history of the opium traffic in
China is a story complete in itself and will be dealt with in
another chapter. At present, we must notice that the trade with
China is practically suspended, but that the British Government
is still auctioning off, once a month at Calcutta, great
quantities of opium. Where does this opium go--who are the
consumers? If not to China, then where? </p>

<p>The same reliable authority, the Statesman's Year-Book for
1918<b>, </b>has this to say on the subject. On page 130 we read:
&quot; Opium: In British territory the cultivation of the poppy
for the production of opium is practically confined to the United
Provinces, and the manufacture of opium from this region is a
State monopoly. The bulk of the exported opium is at<b> </b>present
either sent to the United Kingdom, or supplied direct to the
Governments of consuming countries in the Far East; a certain
quantity is also sold by auction in Calcutta at monthly sales.
Opium is also grown in many of the Native States of Rajputana and
Central India, which have agreed to conform to the British
system.&quot; The following tables, taken from most reliable
authority, give some idea of the exports to the &quot;consuming
countries of the Far East.&quot; Note that Japan began buying
opium in 1911-12<font size="1">2. </font>We shall have something
to say about the Japanese smuggling later. Also note that it was
in 1907<b> </b>that Great Britain and China entered into
agreement, the outcome to be the suppression of the opium trade
in China. But see the increasing imports into the treaty ports;
up till almost the very last moment British opium being poured
into China. In the second table, observe the increasing
importation into England, (United Kingdom), synchronous with the
increased exports to Japan, which will be discussed later.<br>
