<P><CENTER><HR><B>PATENTED CO-COMPOSTING TECHNOLOGY<BR>
for municipal solid waste and sewage sludge<BR>
<BR>
Executive Summary</B><BR>
<HR><B>Background </B></CENTER>
<P>Today, biodegradable organic materials make up more than 60% of the typical
municipal solid waste (MSW) stream. Mounting federal and state recycling
and waste diversion mandates along with increasing costs of siting new landfills
and disposing of sewage sludge, have made composting an economically, as
well as environmentally, sound alternative for municipal waste management
plans in virtually any size community.<BR>
<P><CENTER>BBC's Patented Co-Composting Technology</CENTER>
<P>Bedminster Bioconversion Corporation (BBC), with its patented and proven
technology, converts municipal solid waste (MSW) and municipal sewage sludge
(MSS) to high quality, highly marketable compost within to three to nine
days.<BR>
<BR>
The heart of the Bedminster system is the patented Eweson&reg; (pronounced
Av-e-son) digester, a compartmentalized rotary cylinder that provides the
ideal conditions for rapid microbial activity, accelerating the natural
decomposition of all biodegradable materials into exceptional quality compost.
The benefits of Bedminster's Organagro&reg; compost have been verified by
university research. With an operating facility in Big Sandy, Texas since
1972, Bedminster now has over 20 years of co-composting experience.<BR>
<BR>
The Bedminster system is the world's leading technology for composting both
MSW and sewage sludge. The aerobic, in-vessel process and enclosed facility,
equipped with a complete air treatment system, eliminate odor problems and
prevent air, water or soil pollution. <BR>
<BR>
BBC has presently 3 plants in operation, 3 plants under construction and
licensing agreements in Sweden and Australia.

mandates.<BR>
<BR>
Compatible with conventional recycling programs.<BR>
<BR>
Inert and sanitized residual eliminates landfill leachate, methane gas and
vector problems.<BR>
<BR>
Modular technology provides flexibility to adapt to any size community and
allows for incremental expansion.<BR>
<BR>
Exceeds EPA 503 compost standards for heavy metals and pathogen reduction
to qualify as &quot;Exceptional Quality&quot; for unrestricted use.<BR>
<BR>
Ability to privately finance projects.<BR>
<BR>
Provide process and performance guarantees.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No grinding or shredding of input waste material allows recyclables and
inerts to be separated to ensure highest quality compost.
