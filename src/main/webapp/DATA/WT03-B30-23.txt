DAB rules against Navy control of ASAT

     The Defense Acquisition Board has decided against Navy
control of the anti-satellite program despite Navy protestations
that a sea-based system will best serve the ASAT cause.
     In their review, the board rejected a Navy request to
transfer the ASAT program from Army's Strategic Defense Command
to the Navy's Strategic Systems Program Office.
     The Army is interested in developing a land-based ASAT that
could eventually be upgraded to sea duty. But the Navy wanted to
focus exclusively on the sea-based system, a move that many
suspect weighted the DAB review in the Army's favor.
     A request for proposals is expected sometime in January,
although a specific date has not been established. Judging by the
returns, the Army will borrow from technology based upon the
exoatmospheric re-entry interceptor system being developed under
the auspices of the Strategic Defense Initiative.
     Defense analysts believe the DAB's close-door review should
put an emphatic end to the Navy's insistent demands to head the
program, an issue that has left the program without a clear
operational objective until now.

     The Navy has awarded Raytheon Company a $273.7 million

     The Navy has awarded Raytheon Company a $273.7 million
contract for limited production of the Relocatable Over-the-
Horizon Radar (ROTHR). The decision comes following a
pronouncement by the U.S. Navy Space and Naval Warfare Systems
Command that the company's prototype ROTHR has passed all
operational test and evaluation protocols.
     ROTHR is designed to provide early warning of enemy attacks
by aircraft and ships against U.S. Navy battle groups. With a
operating arc of more than 60 degrees, ROTHR can detect targets
at a range of up to 1,800 miles. OTH radars operate by bouncing
radio waves off the Earth's ionosphere which bounces the waves
back to Earth.
     The first production system will be deployed in Virginia to
replace the prototype (on its way to Amchitka, Alaska) and
provide coverage of the Caribbean. The second unit will take up
residence on the island of Guam. The Navy has not specified the
eventual destination of the third radar.
     Raytheon received the production award in 1984 and has since
instituted over 495,000 lines of software code into the system.
Except for the radar's massive antennas, all of ROTHR is
transportable.

     Raytheon Co. received an early Christmas present late last
month when the Air Force Electronic Systems Div. awarded it a
$174 million contract to begin low-rate initial production (LRIP)
of the Air Force Milstar satellite communications program.
     The announcement provides a breath of fresh air to the
program which has been plagued by cost overruns and significant
delays. The next-generation communications program is expected to
provide worldwide, jam-resistant and survivable teletype, voice
and data communications capabilities for strategic and tactical
C3I efforts.
     Under the terms of the contract, the defense giant will
provide airborne and ground terminals for the tri-service
program.

Corporate survival posture for 1990's: proactive

     There are two types of defense company staring into the
proverbial budget abyss of the 1990s: one which resigns itself to
a fiscally austere future like a deer frozen in the headlights
of some unavoidable disaster; and one that consolidates its
resources and aggressively seeks out new contracts, creating a
need where before there was none.
     NEWS ANALYSIS
     In a series of interviews conducted during the previous two
weeks, C3I Report has learned most contractors are
steering clear of window ledges and are focusing instead on areas
of growth, belt-tightening and resource consolidation.
     For example, TRW's Joseph Aro says the Information Network
Div. for which he works has four telemarketers making 1,200
outbound calls a week in an attempt to solicit new customers for
his company's products.
     A source with Lockheed Corp. suggests the company's decision
to integrate two of its subsidiaries -- Lockheed Electronics Co.
(LEC) with Sanders Associates -- is an indication that the
company is actively seeking the means to trim the fat and "do
what we do best." Lockheed laid off 1,000 of LEC's employees and
moved its operations into Sanders' Nashua, N.H. complex.
     Chrysler Corp. has placed its defense electronics operations
on the block in order to focus exclusively on the competitive
automobile market.
     Northrop Corp. announced plans to sell its spacious
headquarters building in Century City, Los Angeles. "In order to
reduce our debt, we're actively looking at the sale of our non-
operating assets," says Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio.
     The prime contractor for the B-2 is not the only military
aircraft maker to suddenly enter the real estate market. In
early December F-14 producer Grumman Corp. announced plans to
redevelop half its 500-acre Long Island property into a hotel,
shopping mall and office complexes.
     In each of these instances, company officers evaluated their
specific strengths and weaknesses and acted.
     "You've got to be proactive in the current environment,"
says TRW's Aro. "There are a lot of companies that are sitting
out there wringing their hands. That's not our approach."
Creating a market
     As marketing manager for TRW's networks division, Aro
focuses almost exclusively on the Unified Local Area Network
Architecture or ULANA contract, an Air Force system designed to
link military computers with one another. Aro is convinced his
office's aggressive telemarketing efforts are paying off. He said
market conditions for TRW's ULANA products is stronger than that
of Electronic Data Systems, the other prime contractor for ULANA.
     There is a lesson in all this, says Aro. "The more skittish
[contractors] believe anybody can lose their job. They think they
might be driving a truck soon.
     "Others," says Aro, "are charging ahead to get the job
done."

FAA-DOD controversy threatens GPS

     Just when you thought it was safe to go back out on the
water, the system that promises to get you to your destination
and back is again embroiled in bitter controversy.
     A number of aviation groups have complained to Defense
Secretary Richard Cheney and Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner that the Defense Dept. is blocking civil use of the
Pentagon's much-heralded Global Positioning System (GPS).
     GPS is a constellation of two dozen satellites, some of
which are already in orbit, intended to provide extremely
accurate navigation information to aircraft, ships, vehicles and
ground forces around the world.
     The Soviet Union has a similar system called GLONASS. The
Federal Aviation Administration hopes a single receiver can be
built to receive both GPS and GLONASS signals. If satellites are
to become the sole means of navigation, then neither the U.S. nor
Soviet system has enough satellites to provide the required
accuracy. But together they can do it.
     A letter sent to Skinner and Cheney Dec. 13 warns that
unnamed organizations within DOD may now be seeking to subvert
that goal. The unnamed organizations are accused of renewing the
issue of whether GPS data ought to be available to the civil
community, and issuing concerns about technology transfer.
     The on-again off-again GPS controversy is indicative of many
such instances when military and civilian protocols clash. In one
corner stands the Pentagon, ever-wary of the Soviet Union and any
technology transfers that might make their job more difficult. In
the other stands the FAA and related groups interested in
improving civilian navigation. Most years such a clash would have
resulted in a Pentagon victory. But recent developments and the
pervading atmosphere of glasnost may result in a darkhorse
victory.
Increased accuracy for DOD users
     Original plans were to offer a degraded, less accurate level
of GPS navigation for the civil community, while DOD users
would get the more accurate signals. Thus, an enemy could
navigate accurately enough for civil transportation, but could
not use GPS data to guide weapons.
     The current controversy over GPS access stems from an FAA
initiative to coordinate U.S. and Soviet tests of a joint
GPS/GLONASS receiver. FAA officials say the satellite navigation
program follows the terms of a bilateral transportation
cooperation agreement signed at the 1988 Moscow summit.
     The test program was proposed last spring in a joint U.S.-
Soviet working paper presented in Paris at the International
Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) future air navigation system
committee.  An agency of the United Nations, ICAO would use test
results to certify a GPS/GLONASS system as a reliable means of
navigation for international air travel.
     The U.S. and Soviet navigation systems could be augmented
and would form the foundation for a global navigation satellite
system (GNSS). This global system also could employ
geosynchronous calibration transmitters launched by other
nations.
     The multi-national GNSS would be less dependent on the whims
of either superpower. A U.S. aviation expert says this redundancy
is especially important for non-aligned countries who don't want
a navigation system that relies on the whims of a single
superpower.
     Under the plan proposed to ICAO, the U.S. and USSR
separately would build and test civil GPS/GLONASS receivers. FAA
officials say the programs would be done in parallel. Since
sales of civil GPS receivers are permitted under existing export
control regulations, FAA officials say there wouldn't be any need
to transfer hardware or technology. "We've had no difficulty
with the [DOD] tech transfer folks," one said.
     To aid the U.S. test program, FAA would like the Soviets to
provide a civil GLONASS receiver for study. This shouldn't be too
difficult, since Glavkosmos, the Soviet space marketing agency,
has already printed glossy brochures for its "Shkiper" receiver.
     The U.S. dual receiver would be built by M.I.T. Lincoln
Laboratories. The system, which could be modeled on one already
tested by Magnavox, would use orbital elements and time messages
transmitted by GPS and GLONASS satellites to calculate the
position and velocity of an aircraft.
     FAA officials say the two sides would only collaborate at
the end of the test program, sharing results of their navigation
tests. If each side's dual receiver is sufficiently accurate, the
two superpowers could propose ICAO adoption of GNSS.
Divergent views emerge -- again
     Although GPS and GLONASS travel in similar, semisynchronous
orbits, the two systems are not identical. A total of 21 primary
GPS and three spare satellites orbit in six planes, while 24
GLONASS spacecraft occupy three planes. The constellations also
use different formats to transmit position and time information.
     Several FAA officials have indicated they have no intention
of promoting a merger of GPS and GLONASS technology.
"`Commonality' is a trigger word that sets off alarms in the
Pentagon," one said. FAA officials say they won't sign any
agreement that would require DOD to change the way it operates
GPS satellites or its military receivers.
     Until recently, FAA's civil navigation initiative didn't
face any DOD opposition. An agency official said the GNSS joint
working paper was cleared with the Pentagon's C3I office.
     But FAA plans to proceed with the bilateral test program
were stalled when DOD's space operations policy office raised
objections to the effort. This opposition prevented FAA from
starting detailed discussions with their Soviet counterparts last
fall.
     The FAA is hoping to get back on track once the dust clears
from the DOD infighting. One FAA official says the problem may
stem from the space policy office's unfamiliarity with civil
aviation.
     Said one exasperated FAA official, "We are looking forward
to the day when we can work directly with [DOD's] C3I office
again. There's a real misunderstanding of what we're trying to
do [with space ops]."
     FAA's frustration is compounded by DOD's vagueness over
operating policies for GPS. In addition to encrypting the more
highly accurate navigation data for DOD users and providing
civilians with the less reliable data, DOD also reserves the
right to scramble GPS's second channel to frustrate enemy
attempts to spoof military receivers. While civil users could
still navigate with one channel, it would further degrade
navigational accuracy.
     The opening paragraph of the letter to Cheney and Skinner
states: "In 1983 President Reagan made the momentous decision to
make the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite navigation
system, developed by the U.S. Defense Department, available to
the world and to offer an accuracy of navigation which would not
compromise U.S. defense needs."
     Pentagon space ops officials, however, offer a different
interpretation, arguing that the "momentous decision" actually
alluded to a remark made by Reagan spokesman Larry Speakes at a
press conference.
     "If the Soviets are going to use our data for military
purposes, we are stupid. And if they are going to use it to
compete against us in the commercial market, we are still
stupid," a Pentagon officer said.
     He further accused the FAA of violating a written agreement
with the Pentagon barring even the discussion of sensitive
technology in the GPS system, let alone suggesting the
possibility of sharing it with the Soviets.
     "They agreed not to approach that topic, and have abandoned
it," he said.
Is GPS a navigational Everyman?
     The letter was sent to Cheney and Skinner by former FAA
chiefs Donald Engen, Najeeb Halaby, and Lynn Helms. It is also
signed by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the Air
Line Pilots Association, the Airport Operators Council
International, the Air Transport Association, and the National
Business Aircraft Association. It was sent to the media by the
Airport Operators Council International. Questions to that group
were referred to the FAA.
     Another bone of contention within the Pentagon is whether
geoid data should be shared with the Soviets. Geoidal data
describes the absolute shape of world in computer language where
the potential for gravity is considered a constant at any point.
This is the manner in which satellites view the Earth. Many
believe the United States boasts a much more accurate geoidal map
of the world and are reluctant to share this information with the
Soviets. (C3I Report 9/18/89).
     The DOD official said the root issue is whether GPS will
serve as the only navigational system for both military and
civilian users. The military, he noted, won't stand for it. The
FAA is seen at the Pentagon as wanting GPS to replace everything
else: VOR navigation (which makes up the current airway system),
NDB navigation (used in the middle of the century) and LORAN C
navigation.
     There is also mistrust over whether the FAA would simply
hand actual components to the Soviets, rather than data the
Soviets could use to develop their own components for GPS
receivers. The United States has built a GLONASS receiver using
Soviet data.
     Civil aviation experts point to the voluntary submission of
GLONASS information to the U.S. as a testament to the Soviet's
commitment to a joint program. This reversal, which occurred in
early 1988, followed years of Soviet stonewalling on discussing
any details of its system.
     If DOD blocks civil use of GPS, it will be a blow to work
already in progress for use of the system on airplanes and ships.
Officials of the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics said
they were informed of the controversy by AOCI, but will continue
their work. RTCA is a federal advisory group charged with setting
technical standards for receivers that can use both the U.S. and
Soviet satellite navigation systems. Work is already completed on
systems standards for GPS use by the civil sector.
     Work is also in progress on operations performance standards
for aircraft systems, and should be completed by the end of 1990.
There is also work in progress on integrating the Soviet system
with GPS, enabling aircraft to navigate solely with GPS, GLONASS
or both.
     If the Pentagon can be convinced to allow civil use of GPS
for aircraft, separation standards could be reduced safely,
allowing more aircraft to use trans-Atlantic routes at one time.
     An RTCA official said a receiver for the Soviet system has
been built under an FAA contract to Mitre, Bedford, Mass.
     And the Radio Technical Commission for Maritime has a group
formed to advise the federal government on standards for GPS
systems aboard ships.
TAKE OUT QUOTE: "We are looking forward to the day when we can
work directly with [DOD's] C3I office again. There's a real
misunderstanding of what we're trying to do [with space ops]." --

Milstar: all wired and nothing to control

     With little fanfare, the Air Force quietly installed a huge
control room for Milstar communications satellites.
     Located in Air Force Space Command's Consolidated Space
Operations Center (CSOC), the Milstar control room is now in the
final stages of installation at Falcon AFB, Colo.
     Formally known as Mission Control Center 3, the Milstar
control room will be able to handle an operational constellation
of 10 extremely high frequency communications satellites. During
a crisis or war, the Falcon center could control satellites
through fixed and mobile ground stations.
     Although MCC-3's IBM 3090 computers are nearly hooked up and
ready to run, the control center won't do much satellite
controlling for the next two or three years. A continuing series
of technical problems and funding cuts will delay the launch of
the first Milstar satellite until at least 1992.
     Until the first Milstar flies, SSD plans to use the center
for software development and training. This debugging period will
be an unaccustomed luxury for SSD, which is three years behind
schedule on three other Falcon control centers.
     SSD plans to turn over its first CSOC center to Space
Command this month. The MCC-1A center controls Navstar
navigational satellites. MCC-1B, which controls meteorological
and missile warning satellites, will be turned over in January.
An MCC-2 control room for four communications satellite systems
will be operational late next year.
