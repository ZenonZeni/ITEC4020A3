Surveillance equipment manufacturer <BR>
trusts NewsNet for current company news</H2><BR CLEAR=ALL>


The market research specialist for Sensormatic Electronics Corporation, Dan Martin, depends on NewsNet for keeping track of information on his company, for competitive information, general company news, and for providing a comprehensive look at target markets.<P>

Sensormatic Electronics, located in Deerfield, Florida,  is engaged in the manufacture of
electronic article surveillance and microprocessor closed circuit television systems that are used to deter shoplifting and theft in retail stores.<P>

Dan accesses the NewsNet multiple times each day. Primarily responsible for assisting
his staff in finding information on specific companies, he spends time helping them locate specific articles and finding supplemental information on new topics of interest as they arise.<P>

As with many NewsNet users, NewsFlash is one of Dan's favorite features. "I like NewsFlash the most because it allows me to input specific keywords and it enables me to monitor all of the NewsNet files in a way that I am guaranteed not to miss anything," he said.  "Information in our business can come out just about anywhere."<P>

Dan finds the Investext files to be a valuable source of company information. "The Investext company reports conducted by analysts and brokerage firms allow me to obtain very specific information about particular companies," he said. "Reports include company strategies and current markets, and some include their five-year strategic plans," he continued. "I like the in-depth analysis that you can retrieve from an Investext report; you are not just limiting yourself to financial records."<P>
