<h1>The Destruction of OSHA Reform</h1>
<h2>by the Health Commission, CPUSA</h2>

<p> It came as no surprise to workers and their unions that 
Republicans took over the Senate and the House of 
Representatives, and are readying themselves to retake the 
White House in 1994. Although trade unionists voted two to 
one in favor of Democratic candidates, the broken promises 
of the Clinton presidency insured that the overall voter 
turnout of working people would be low. </p>

<p> The die was cast when President Clinton, in office hardly 
more than one year, called organized labor a "bunch of 
strong-armed goons." He pulled out all stops to get the 
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) passed, and 
wasn't above slandering the labor movement to do so.</p>

<p> This is the same president who refused to lift a finger to 
get the anti-scab bill (S-55) enacted and who reneged on his 
promise of national health care. Clinton increasingly came 
to be seen as pro-monopoly and anti-labor. </p>

<p> In the background throughout these struggles was the 
workers' battle to reform the 1970 Occupational Safety and 
Health Act. The abbreviated phrase for this effort became 
"OSHA reform."</p>

<h4> Auto Workers Strike Over Speed Up</h4>

 <p>On September 13, 1994, Clinton's Labor Secretary Robert 
Reich announced the demise of the OSHA reform legislation. 
At the same time, auto workers were taking matters into 
their own hands. "The Big 3 (Ford, Chrysler and General 
Motors) can't make cars and trucks fast enough" was the New 
York Times headline. While the Ford Motor Company's sales 
rose 14.5 percent to $3.5 million, autoworkers represented 
by the United Auto Workers Union fell 10 percent, from 
106,600 to 96,000. </p>

<p> At the Livonia, Michigan GM engine plant, local union 
leaders pointed to layoffs as the reason for the increase in 
health and safety problems. GM is producing more engines 
today than in 1992, yet the workforce has been reduced from 
1,500 to 1,000 workers. After weeks of struggle and a major, 
week-long strike, GM agreed to rehire 799 workers, admitting 
that the layoffs were the culprit. The strike was a reaction 
to the super-exploitation taking place in the auto industry, 
and it caused extensive production problems for the company. </p>

 <p>It soon became a painful reality that despite this 
increasing exploitation, revision of the OSHA law, a 
supposed Clinton priority, would die a silent death. Job 
safety and health has not been a priority in either the 
Clinton or Democratic Party agendas and we will all suffer 
for it.</p>

 <h4>Reform Needed</h4>

<p> During the first 20-plus years of the federal OSHA 
legislation, President Carter's was the only Democratic 
administration. OSHA head Dr. Eula Bingham was very 
sympathetic to workers and their unions, which made her very 
unpopular with the Carter administration. Then-Secretary of 
Labor Ray Marshall often fought for a strong OSHA law. 
Marshall did a far better job representing the interests of 
working people than has Reich. Marshall's positions also 
made him very unpopular with the Carter administration and 
Democratic Party bigwigs.</p>

 <p>Promising in the 1980 election campaign to throw "OSHA into 
the ocean," the Reagan/Bush team, once elected, pulled every 
possible administrative trick to kill its effectiveness.</p>

<p> Ironically, in 1978-80, before the 12 years of Republican 
rule began, the Democrats, in 1978-80, led by Senator Edward 
Kennedy, engineered the first thrust against regulation in 
general, and OSHA in particular. The 1980 Occupational 
Safety and Health "Improvement" Act, actually authored by 
Democratic Party Congressional leaders, attempted to kill 
OSHA enforcement and other important safety and health 
rules. Only a broad-based grassroots movement stopped them.</p>

 <p>During the Reagan/Bush years, the job safety and health 
movement fought every effort to administratively kill 
enforcement. Each change was met with stiff resistance. Out 
of that fightback movement came the effort to reform the 
law. Many meetings within the labor movement and in 
coalitions among safety and health activists were held to 
develop a legislative agenda to make OSHA stronger.</p>

<p> The OSHA reform legislation was "drafted" in the period 
from the 1980s to 1992. The House Labor Committee passed the 
legislation in 1992. The final legislative proposal, while 
having many progressive aspects, could have been much 
stronger if a class struggle approach had been taken by all 
of labor. </p>

 <p>It was against this background that leaders of the safety 
and health, labor, medical/scientific and community 
movements prepared for the 1992 presidential elections. The 
Democratic Party platform and Bill Clinton's campaign 
promises contained the basis for OSHA reform that would 
significantly improve the safety and health of workers. </p>

<p> The election of Bill Clinton also brought a significant 
Democratic Party margin in both the U.S. Senate and House of 
Representatives. This increased the hope for the passage of 
reform. This was supposed to be the "no veto Congress" 
everyone fought for. </p>

<h4> Election Hopes Dimmed</h4>

 <p>From the beginning of the Clinton administration, with the 
appointment of lackluster people like Robert Reich to head 
the Department of Labor and Donna Shalala to head Health and 
Human Services (this is where the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is housed), the 
worrying began. They were appointed over more qualified and 
aggressive candidates. The impact of the Democratic 
Leadership Council (DLC), the right-wing of the Democratic 
Party that controls the Party's strategies and appointments, 
and the AFL-CIO collaborationist policy began to take hold. 
When Reich, in September 1994 sent OSHA reform to the grave, 
he added insult to injury by warning that only if the bill 
gets "reworked" will it be reconsidered in 1995. In 
Washington Beltway jargon, that means, make it more 
acceptable to Big Business.</p>

<p> To head up OSHA, the White House and Reich refused highly 
qualified candidates who were proposed by organized labor. 
Joe Dear, a state of Washington official and a career 
administrator, was selected to head OSHA. A similar scenario 
took place in the appointment of the NIOSH head. Appointing 
a qualified labor union expert to head OSHA, and a labor 
recommended medical/scientist to head NIOSH, would have sent 
the right message to corporate profiteers in reverse of what 
Reagan/Bush did in 1981 by hiring incompetent corporate 
people to head the Department of Labor and OSHA.</p>

 <h4>Mass Mobilization Is Key</h4>

 <p>For almost five years the labor movement and its allies 
mobilized to pressure members of Congress to pass OSHA 
reform. Local COSH groups (committees on safety and health) 
showed remarkable effectiveness in pressuring local elected 
officials. But as the list of sponsors in the House and 
Senate grew, an eerie silence started to come from the 
newly-elected officials in the White House, Congress and the 
Department of Labor.</p>

 <p>For a number of years, "Worker Memorial Days" (April 28th 
each year), speeches and related activities were used to 
agitate for the passage of OSHA reform legislation. These 
special mobilization days, sponsored by the National AFL-CIO 
and supported by local grassroots groups, reached into every 
nook and cranny in the United States. Lobbying took place in 
Washington, D.C. and at the local offices of legislators. 
State legislatures and locally elected officials passed 
supporting resolutions.</p>

<p> During the first stages of the Clinton administration, all 
of the routine legislative activities took place. Union 
lobbyists met with administration and congressional staffs. 
Extensive labor/management meetings (in accordance with DLC 
and AFL-CIO orders) were held to attempt to work out a 
consensus on key issues. Things seemed to be generally on 
course.</p>

 <p>But other events were pointing in a different direction. 
Clinton was in full gear getting the anti-labor NAFTA bill 
passed, while the anti-scab bill was in the process of being 
killed. Health reform was on the road to ruin. Contrary to 
right-wing allegations that Clinton and congressional 
leaders were pursuing socialized medicine, they were, in 
reality, preparing health care for the insurance and drug 
industries, for-profit hospitals and banking monopolies (see 
Political Affairs, November, 1994.) The White House 
legislative agenda was appearing markedly anti-labor.</p>

 <p>While the White House and Congress were doing their dirty 
deeds, the Washington D.C. Beltway "permanent government" 
was being utilized to kill reform. Increasingly well known 
to unions is the use of Department of Labor lawyers, in its 
infamous Solicitor's Office, to pick reform legislation 
apart. Movement activists are familiar with the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB was used by those 
opposed to an effective OSHA to stop progressive regulatory 
activity in the 1970s and early '80s. In recent times, the 
Solicitor's Office has become the vehicle to fight against 
progressive change. It is the one-two punch of the OMB and 
the Solicitor's Office that has subverted the original 
intent of Congress.</p>

 <p>All important OSHA regulatory actions taken against 
employers must be cleared through the Solicitor's Office, 
and the first stop for the Solicitor's Office is the 
Secretary of Labor. If the Secretary of Labor were an 
independent-minded leader, someone willing to fight the 
increasingly anti-labor White House, then maybe workers 
would have gotten an even break. That was the struggle under 
the Carter administration when Marshall and Bingham often 
helped labor with its agenda.</p>

<p> That is not the case under Clinton. As months dragged on, 
it became painfully clear that Secretary Reich - who once 
said that unions should not be necessary - cared little 
about workers and their unions and a lot more about his 
career with the Clinton administration. The difference 
between the labor departments under Carter and Clinton has 
become increasingly clear, with the understanding that 
Carter was hardly the standard for a pro-worker 
administration.</p>

<p> Department of Labor lawyers were assigned to working 
committees dealing with each key aspect of the pending law. 
They brought with them the political power of the Secretary 
of Labor, the White House, leaders of the Democratic Party 
in the House and Senate and their allegiance to big 
business. The leaders of the Senate and House Committees 
were usually very supportive of a strong OSHA law, but when 
they went to their Democratic leaders the message was 
increasingly clear: tone it down or it won't see the light 
of day. Active grassroots labor lobbying kept these leaders 
honest and supportive. But above that level, the struggle 
was far less effective. The darkness fell like a lead 
balloon.</p>

<h4> Corporations Evade Law</h4>

 <p>The key elements of the OSHA reform legislation are its 
enforcement provisions. From the beginning, employers 
assigned their attorneys to determine how they could avoid 
the law or use it as a shield against legal actions by 
workers and their unions. By the end of OSHA's first 10 
years, this shield was used to conceal employers' disregard 
for safety and health laws. The legal term is pre-emption. 
The courts ruled that if there is a federal law, then if 
someone is disabled or killed the employer cannot be 
indicted by the courts. The only remedy is through 
inspections. This is similar to how employers use workers' 
compensation as a legal shield against lawsuits from workers 
who become disabled or die on the job. </p>

<p> By the early part of the 1980s, local district attorneys 
were being pressured to take worker-killing employers into 
court. In Chicago, the owners of Film Recovery Inc. were 
found guilty of killing a worker who they willfully exposed 
to cyanide. They tried to use the OSHA shield, but the local 
district attorney successfully indicted and convicted the 
employer. One company official served some jail time, but 
the owner of the company fled to Utah and was not brought 
back to serve time. This case, however, provided an 
important precedent. </p>

<p> In Brooklyn, New York, the owners of Pymm Thermometer Co. 
were brought into court for seriously endangering their 
employees. Mercury poisoning was the issue here. At first, 
the courts ruled this could not be done, since the only 
remedy was OSHA. Federal pre-emption was, again, the issue. 
That later changed and the owners of Pymm faced criminal 
penalties. </p>

<p> In Hamlet, North Carolina, at a major poultry factory fire 
disaster, 25 workers were killed due to locked exits. This 
was very similar to the New York City Triangle Shirtwaist 
fire in 1911 where over 150 women garment workers were 
killed, also due to locked exits. This disaster elevated 
corporate criminal penalties. It became a centerpiece of 
OSHA reform. The Department of Labor Solicitor's Office 
fought hard against this provision and ultimately won. </p>

 <h4>Who Will Run Workplace Committees?</h4>

<p> An outcome of OSHA legislation could have been the federal 
requirement that every plant and workplace must have a 
safety and health committee through which detection, control 
and prevention of job safety and health hazards take place. 
This kind of a system, in various forms, is very popular 
around the world and would have been popular at shops here 
at home. The former socialist countries had these 
committees. </p>

 <p>In Sweden, plant-based safety and health committees are 
established by law throughout the country. These are 
labor/management committees. But, in a very advanced form, 
these committees must be chaired by the labor union at the 
plant, and there must be at least one more union member than 
management members. The logic is that without this pro-labor 
provision, workers and their unions would not have any faith 
in these committees. </p>

<p> At the least, the demand should have been that every 
worksite have a legally recognized union committee. What was 
proposed however was a system of labor/management committees 
of equal numbers and status. Under this kind of system, 
workers and their unions would surely be at risk if they 
told the truth. Employer retaliation would be swift against 
militant representatives on these committees. Sanctions 
against employers who discriminate against workers who 
exercise their rights is almost non-existent. The union-only 
committee would have afforded workers time to conduct 
private meetings during working hours. No wonder corporate 
leaders would not like this kind of proposal. </p>

<p> This proposed labor/management committee system was 
supported by workers and their unions, because many did not 
know that a union-only system was possible. When OSHA reform 
came under attack, this provision did not ignite much 
fightback. While it's true a strong local union could win 
the right to union-run committees, this is rare. Here again, 
the class collaborationist policies of the Kirkland 
leadership pushes in the direction of a labor/management 
system. If that strategy was meant to win legislative 
support, it totally failed. But along with that failure 
comes a disarming of workers' ability to fight for a more 
militant program. </p>

<h4> One Unified, Strong Law</h4>

 <p>When OSHA was enacted, Congress refused labor's efforts to 
create one safety and health law protecting all workers. The 
goal was to correct that "compromise" and eliminate the 
legal and administrative loopholes that employers use to 
gain an advantage over workers. </p>

<p> Under OSHA reform, the following federal agency safety and 
health laws were meant to be brought together under a 
strengthened law. These areas include: Mine Safety and 
Health Administration (all underground work); Department of 
Transportation (railroad, trucking, airlines); Department of 
Energy (all atomic energy sites); Jones Act (high seas); and 
Federal Workers. The new unified law was not meant to reduce 
standards, but to use the most stringent rules from each 
area.</p>

<p> Since unions have multiple jurisdictions, a local union 
committee composed of representatives from each regulatory 
area would put the union in the driver's seat. It would have 
prevented employers from trying to hide behind regulation 
overlap gaps. This provision is especially important for 
public workers who are excluded from federal OSHA coverage. </p>

<p> When OSHA was passed one of the most backward of all 
congressional compromises was the "states rights" 
provisions. Under this provision, any state could enact its 
own OSHA law as long as its program was "as effective as" 
the federal law. Twenty-four states went this route. All the 
Southern and Southwestern states took the road of states' 
rights. Unfortunately, California, Oregon, Washington, and 
Michigan, states with relatively strong labor movements, 
also took this route. </p>

<p> OSHA had a State Plan Office which was supposed to monitor 
this program. It has been underfunded from the beginning. 
Reform did not attempt to eliminate this provision. It 
merely called for more oversight. This was clearly not 
enough. By not calling for the elimination of these state 
plans, valuable local support was lost. </p>

<p> The disaster at Hamlet highlighted the state plan debacle. 
At that non-union site, North Carolina inspectors failed to 
adequately inspect the plant. Even with this disaster, 
bringing all states under the federal law was not fully 
considered. Investigations and committees were established 
and a lot of militant words came from North Carolina and 
federal officials. But, ultimately, nothing happened. </p>

 <p>The hidden government of the U.S. Department of Labor's 
Solicitor's Office was a target. This office, as much as the 
infamous Office of Management and Budget, has been 
responsible for destroying the effectiveness of OSHA. When 
workers and their unions complain about the failure of OSHA 
to seek the strongest penalties against employers, the 
culprit is usually the Solicitor's Office. Its directives 
come from the pro-corporate offices of the White House and 
the Democratic Party's political machine. </p>

<h4> Equity With EPA</h4>

 <p>More often than not, community environmental hazards are 
created at the factory. Factory workers face occupational-
related illnesses and injuries in far stronger doses than do 
people living in the community. Yet the EPA receives funding 
well over 10 times that of OSHA. The reverse funding 
strategy should have taken place. From its inception the EPA 
was seen as the more important agency. It was given its own 
government status and is not under any other agency. The 
same was wanted for OSHA. The lower bureaucratic status 
radically reduced its funding potential.</p>

 <p>Over the years, there have been some very successful 
working relationships between pro-EPA and OSHA activists. 
Right-wing and corporate ideologues are continually trying 
to drive wedges between worker and community safety and 
health activists. But it has been more difficult to divide 
the two in recent times. For example, the Sierra Club and 
other environmental organizations gave strong support to 
anti-NAFTA activities. </p>

 <p>Combining OSHA and EPA could be a good idea, but only if 
the best of both laws was used as the common denominator. 
For example, OSHA has far stronger (at least intended) 
enforcement powers than EPA. In reality, the difference is 
probably not a lot, but stronger enforcement powers are 
needed for both laws. Unfortunately, Congress and the White 
House have chosen both low funding and weak enforcement 
powers to kill the real strength of both laws. </p>

<p> In the Eula Bingham/Ray Marshall administration, $15 
million was distributed each year for labor education and 
training programs. This program was essential to spawning a 
nationwide safety and health awareness program. By contrast, 
Reich has offered a paltry $1.5 million each year.</p>

<p> These educational programs were instrumental in bringing 
safety and health to every corner of the United States. They 
served as an incentive for the training of safety and health 
professionals into the field of health and safety. Since 
most of the funding went to labor unions, it helped unions 
establish and expand safety and health programs. No wonder 
corporate power said no to an educational program similar to 
the Marshall/Bingham period. The Clinton/Reich regime made 
no effort to increase funding of this important program.</p>

<p> An important part of the bill would have established a 
national rule of protecting workers from repetitive motion 
and lifting hazards. This field of science has become known 
as ergonomics. It is estimated that $100 billion in lost 
work time is due to such injuries. The future of a new 
standard on ergonomics, given the unwillingness of the 
Clinton administration to fight corporate lobbying efforts 
and Congressional Republicans, is rather dim. Nancy 
Kassebaum (R-Kan.), the new head of the Senate Labor 
Committee, has rejected this OSHA proposal, saying it is 
better left to state and local governments. </p>

<p> OSHA reform did not improve the federal marshal inspection 
system. When union representatives raised the issue of 
hiring more inspectors, they were told it was not possible 
because there is "too much anti-government feelings." These 
officials said that labor/management committees and the 
voluntary compliance that would come through that 
cooperation would take care of enforcement. This far-fetched 
idea was not believed.</p>

<p> Fear of inspections remains a crucial union strategy to 
force employer compliance. Therefore, the 1,500 federal 
inspectors in 26 states is totally inadequate. An even lower 
level of inspectors exists in the other 24 state plan 
inspection systems. </p>

<p> A reasonable demand would be to immediately put 10,000 
federal inspectors into the field to protect workers from 
the super-exploitation being faced by workers, and 20,000 if 
all states were covered by federal OSHA. </p>

 <h4>International Health and Safety</h4>

 <p>"One international working class, one struggle against the 
transnationals" - That is rapidly becoming the workers' 
demand from every corner of the world. In the Western 
Hemisphere, the failed struggle against NAFTA with its 
intent to lower working standards in Mexico, Canada and the 
United States was a new eye-opener. The cry of 
internationalism was heard in all three countries. GATT 
negotiations are bringing the same response - in this case 
it includes Europe (notably Scandinavia) and Asia. The 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, with their 
transnational corporate directors, are licking their profit-
chops at the potential of NAFTA, GATT and other trade deals. </p>

<p> The collapse of socialism in the Soviet Union and eastern 
Europe has exposed all workers to greater exploitation. The 
power, at this time, is clearly in the hands of the 
transnational corporations (TNCs). The disastrous and widely 
reported increase in child labor exploitation is but one 
example.</p>

<p> But the turnaround is coming. Health and safety activists 
have long learned that standards and enforcement in the 
United States are well below other countries. Through the 
phony cry of tearing down trade barriers, TNCs are seeking 
the lowest common denominator from all countries. This is an 
arena of struggle that must be increased. </p>

 <h4>Health Reform</h4>

 <p>That the struggle for health care reform and OSHA reform 
took place at the same time should have helped both 
struggles. But some lobbyists and strategists saw them as 
competing for Congressional action. Many health activists 
understand that real health reform should start at the 
workplace.</p>

<p> A unified health program is needed for both workers on the 
job and people living in the communities, regardless of 
where they work or live. One of the weaknesses of the great 
health care reform struggles of the 1992-94 period was the 
lack of inclusion of work-related health delivery issues. 
The work-relatedness of diseases and injury, and their 
prevention, must be addressed in the next period of health 
reform struggle. Over 100,000 workers die each year from 
work-related illnesses and injuries. Tens of thousands are 
disabled and rely on health services either through their 
workers' compensation insurance or the regular system of 
employer paid group insurance. </p>

<p> Since it is practically impossible for workers to win 
compensation claims for work-related illnesses, they must 
rely on the health system everyone else is saddled with for 
treatment of illnesses. This will bring tens of thousands of 
workers and their families into the struggle for real health 
care reform. Workers and their unions can give valuable 
examples of their experiences with workers' compensation 
carriers as an example of how all insurance carriers treat 
people. They will also be able to describe the evils of 
state plans to gain benefits since the decrepit workers' 
compensation system is entirely state-based.</p>

<p> This combined struggle would have united the health care 
and the OSHA reform struggles. The enemies of both pieces of 
legislation were certainly working together. The disastrous 
experience with OSHA state plans, workers' compensation and 
state-based Medicaid and Medicare, even in their quasi-
federal form, must be not repeated with single payer state 
plans. The Republican-controlled Congress will reject 
federal action in favor of state solutions.</p>

<p> Class collaboration in the trade union movement must be 
overcome. The road to full achievement of worker and labor 
rights does not go through the dead-end of labor/management 
cooperative schemes. Business unionism that relies on 
collaborating with employers is a McCarthyite holdover that 
has not been successful in winning any victories for workers 
or their unions. The failure of the Clinton administration 
to support any of the key labor issues in its first two 
years shows the bankruptcy of the labor/management strategy. 
Safety and health activists can help to lead workers and 
their unions out of this dead-end approach. </p>

<p> Keeping the pressure on Congress and the White House must 
continue. But that pressure must switch from top-level 
individual lobbying efforts to mass struggle tactics. The 
labor movement and its community allies can not match the 
financial contributions to politicians from the 
corporations. Corporate power and money can only be balanced 
through the mobilization of large numbers of people. The 
lobbying of politicians in state capitols and in the halls 
of Congress also means that grassroots tactics and 
strategies are needed.</p>

<p> Such grassroots struggles could include: workplace actions 
around safety and health; building local committees; forming 
and joining with broad-based coalitions for social change; 
building Worker's Memorial Day activities; public 
demonstrations at corporate offices; national demonstrations 
in Washington; joining the struggles for national health 
care with the fight for strict OSHA enforcement; and 
building national and international working-class unity that 
will put an end to the destructive policies of GATT and 
NAFTA. </p>

 <p>With the Republicans controlling the Senate and the House 
of Representatives, and with the White House moving even 
more to the right, the importance of mass action has grown. 
Political pundits predict a further demise of labor unions 
and the end of progressive positions on social and economic 
issues. But history shows that when the working class is 
mobilized its power can overcome politicians and their 
corporate backers. With the conditions of workers' safety 
and health growing worse every day, the willingness to join 
in fightback activities will increase dramatically. Now is 
the time to unleash the power of workers through independent 
political action, sparked by grassroots worksite actions on 
issues of health and safety.</p>
