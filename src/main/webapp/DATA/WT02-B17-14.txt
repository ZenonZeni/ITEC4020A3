The goal of this project is to develop a clean, sustainable 
transportation system for a 

community.  The project is managed by a consortium that includes the 
City of Palm Desert, 

California, the Schatz Energy Research Center, and E.I. DuPont de 
Nemours &amp Co.  The 

project involves four main tasks: (1) designing, building, and operating 
a fleet of personal utility vehicles and neighborhood electric vehicles 
powered by hydrogen-fueled, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells; 
(2) designing, building, and operating a refueling infrastructure 
appropriate for future hydrogen-based transportation systems; (3) 
developing materials and manufacturing techniques for PEM fuel cell 
production; and (4) designing and constructing a PEM fuel cell service 
and diagnostic center.

<b><I>Recent Advances</I>:</b>

<P>The fuel cell has continued to run on the test bench since late

March with excellent performance.  We planned to have the stack

in the cart by this time but have been delayed by software and

electronics problems.  We now estimate that the fuel cell will

be installed by mid-May.  We continued discussions with Dupont

about the new membranes.  Dupont has agreed to send us a sample

of the Nafion&#174; 1135 experimental membrane for testing.  Performance


should improve with this thinner, more conductive membrane.

<P>

The EZ-GO golf cart that will serve as our first delivered vehicle

(Cart 1) was disassembled, and hydrogen storage tanks and associated

high-pressure fuel delivery hardware (solenoid valves, pressure-relief

valves, regulators) and the water circulation system have been

installed and tested.  The heat exchangers and fans also have

been installed.  Structural changes to the frame have been completed

to allow installation of the batteries and fuel cell. We are adding some 


extra safety features to Cart 1:  a front bumper and a roll bar.

<P>

We continued collaborating with personnel from Sandia National

Laboratories on development of hydride storage for the vehicles.

 They have completed a preliminary computer model predicting behavior

of the cart thermal and fuel systems using data we delivered to

them.  Sandia personnel have also begun negotiations with Hydrogen

Consultants to obtain a prototype hydride storage system for testing

in August.  One of our major tasks has been to analyze,

modify, document, and debug existing software.  We have written

the manual cart control and diagnostic software and the foundation

of the automated control software, which allows the cart to be

run and sensors to be debugged. 

<P>

We moved forward in identifying a neighborhood electric vehicle

(NEV) appropriate for this project by speaking to individuals

at CALSTART, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, the Personal

Independent Vehicle Company (PIVCO) of Norway, and several other

electric vehicle manufacturers and retrofitters.  We decided that

the best possibility for an NEV, given our time constraints, is

the Kewet, a Danish car marketed in Southern California and costing

around $15,000, which meets U.S. safety standards.  Although space

is at a premium, it appears to meet all our requirements.  We ordered 

a Kewet and began testing it in May.

<P>

The preliminary layout of the photovoltaic hydrogen generating

and refueling station was completed.  An artist's rendition of

the station was presented to the Palm Desert city manager, economic

development director, and director of buildings and safety in

April.  The response was uniformly positive.  While we were

in Palm Desert, we visited a sunline natural gas refueling

station and a local 12-kW photovoltaic system and met with an

advanced transportation task force to discuss safety and refueling

issues.

<P>

We have nearly completed the development of SERC web pages.   We 

exhibited and ran the prototype PUV at the L.A. Fleet Auto Show and 

Eco Expo, as well as at the City of Palm Desert Clean Cities 
Celebration. 

The reception from the public and from officials was very positive.

The BBC filmed the prototype in action in Arcata and Palm Desert.

A six-minute clip aired in Great Britain in May.  Hoes Engineering

is interested in continuing to work with us to ensure safety in all 
systems

in the PUV, the NEV, the generating and refueling stations, and the 
service center.

Dr. Michael Swain of  the University of Miami has also agreed to work 
with us 

on safety issues.
