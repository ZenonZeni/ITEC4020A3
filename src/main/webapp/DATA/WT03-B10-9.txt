It's Curtain Time For AT&T Interchange


The fat lady finally sang.  AT&T is phasing out its proprietary online
publishing platform AT&T Interchange by the end of 1996, Michael Kolowich,
president of AT&T New Media Services, told EIR (see related story).

Why shut down the online version?  "With this move, we are acknowledging and
capturing industry and customer trends," Kolowich said.  "We are creating open
and inoperable standards," with the Web initiative.

Publishing Partners Jumping Ship

AT&T InterChange never really took hold as a leading electronic publishing
system.  The service literally only had a handful of publishing partners -
five to be exact - ZD Net, Gartner Group, The Star Tribune Online, The
Washington Post/Digital Ink and The Journal Register.

During the last few months, several publishing partners have been turning to
the World Wide Web to publish their information rather than use AT&T
InterChange.  For example, The Star Tribune Online (STO) announced that it
would upgrade its World Wide Web presence.  A STO/Web edition is scheduled for
release in February.  STO is a unit of Cowles Media Company.  SIMBA
Information Inc., publisher of this newsletter, is an affiliate of Cowles.

Gartner Group announced its Web publishing strategy this week (see related
story).

ZD Net, an electronic warehouse of computer product and industry news,
announced its Web site earlier this year.  Digital Ink and Journal Register
Company have yet to state their Web publishing initiatives.

Europe Online, which licensed AT&T Interchange last year, abandoned the online
platform earlier this year in favor of the Web (EIR, Nov.  17, 1995).

Interchangeable Parts

Kolowich said that "there is a tremendous amount of reusable[AT&T Interchange]
components that are applicable to Web use, such as software code and tools."

Where it's appropriate, "some AT&T Interchange publishing partners will
continue to provide their content on BizNet," Kolowich said.  Pieces of AT&T
Interchange's publishing partners content are already available on BizNet.

AT&T New Media Services expects to redeploy its AT&T Interchange development
staff.  AT&T New Media Services has 300 employees.  "None of those 300
employees are part of AT&T's severance package," Kolowich said.  AT&T is
cutting 40,000 jobs over the next three years (see related story).

AT&T Abandons All Online Systems For Web

AT&T is following in the footsteps of many other online services and content
providers and abandoning its other proprietary online systems o ImagiNation
Network, an online games service and PersonaLink, an e-mail service o and will
remodel these services based on World Wide Web standards.

AT&T said that a small portion of a $4 billion after-tax restructuring charge
against fourth quarter earnings would cover its online products being written
off or revalued.

Web Version Of AT&T BizNet By Mid-96


A World Web Web version of AT&T Business Network (BizNet), a newly launched
online service, will debut by mid-1996, said Michael Kolowich, AT&T New Media
Services president.  The company will phase out the online version of the
service.  BizNet, which launched this fall, is an online information service
for business professionals (EIR, Sept.  22, 1995).

BizNet, which has in excess of 10,000 registered users, is "growing rapidly,"
Kolowich said.  Since launch, the company has distributed more than 100,000
trial kits.

"We expect usage to be mushrooming on the Web," Kolowich said.  "What's more
challenging is the content [piece]...there's currently more content than
eyeballs habituated to it [the Web]."

The most usage on BizNet is currently being generated from the Dow Jones and
CNN content components (EIR, Oct.  20, 1995), Kolowich said.  Entrepreneur
toolkits, research tools and daily discussions are also popular, he added.

$10M+ Ad Campaign

As part of BizNet's launch, AT&T is spending in excess of $10 million on its
6-month marketing and advertising campaign that kicked off with various ads in
early December and during this past season's collegiate football bowl games,
Kolowich said.

Gartner Group Follows Other AT&T Interchange IPs To Web


Like other AT&T Interchange content providers including The Star Tribune
Online, Gartner Group plans to offer @vantage, its online market research and
analysis service on information technology on the Internet starting in the
second quarter (EIR, May 12, 1995).

The @vantage Web site, which will be developed independently of AT&T, was
motivated by Gartner's desire to broaden availability of @vantage, said Kate
Berg, company spokesperson.  Berg denied that the mirror site on the Internet
foreshadows a break from its eight-month-long relationship with AT&T
Interchange.

"We have a lot of customers that would be very upset if we moved off
Interchange," said Berg, noting that since launching in May 1995, @vantage is
profitable and has grown steadily to 1,000 users, most of which are Gartner
Group clients.

Gartner charges clients $2,000 and non-clients $4,800 annually to subscribe.
Assuming 60%-85% of the 1,000 @vantage subscribers are clients, @vantage
generated estimated subscription revenues of $2.4 million to $3.1 million by
the end of 1995.

@vantage also takes a small share of transaction revenues from its ten
partners which include BRP Publications, Dataquest, Esther Dyson's Release
1.0, Individual and Pathfinder Research, Jeffrey Tarter's SoftLetter, Amy Wohl
and Workgroup Strategic.

Momentum Picks Up In Business Information Market


The demand for data in new electronic formats and information on new
technologies has pulled the business information market out of its recession,
according to the newly published Business Information Markets 1999:  The
Strategic Outlook (BIM).  SIMBA is the publisher of BIM and this newsletter.

Business information growth rates have risen steadily over the last few years,
from 2.9% in 1991 to 5.1% in 1992 and 5.6% in 1993.  Business information
revenues reached $25.4 billion in 1994, a 9.5% increase from $23.1 billion in
1993.  Revenues are projected to exceed $27 billion in 1995.

BIM defines business information as any copyrighted or proprietary information
produced for a business or professional audience.  The research report
concentrates on 10 business publishing markets and media, including online
databases, print databases, trade magazines and newspapers, face-to-face and
audiovisual services, general business periodicals, research services and
reports, looseleafs, newsletters, CD ROM databases and business books.

Largest Segment By Format - Still Print

As it has in past years, print remains the largest business information
segment by format, with sales of $13.7 billion in 1994.  However, print's
market share continued to slip from 57.0% in 1993 to 54.3% in 1994.

Electronic services accounted for 37% of the business information market in
1994, according to BIM.  Sales of electronic services were $9.3 billion in
1994.  By 1999, SIMBA estimates that online services will account for close to
50% of business information revenues.

The remainder of the market consists of face-to-face and audiovisual
information services, which had revenues of more than $2.2 billion.
Face-to-face and AV accounted for 8.8% of the market in 1994, down from 9.1%
in 1993.

Database Revenues $13.8B In '94

Database publishing continues to be the largest business information segment,
with revenues of $13.8 billion in 1994.  Comparatively, database publishing
revenues were $12.1 billion in 1993.  BIM defines databases as any collection
of information from archival literature and text documents to real-time
financial services and market quotes to directories and fax updates.

Challenges Ahead

There are several obstacles ahead for business publishers, including the
uncertainty of advertising revenues, demand for wider distribution of data,
industry consolidation and increased market competition.

Reuters '95 Sales To Fall Shy Of Record '94 Levels


Reuters' 1995 sales growth will reach into the double digits, but will not
equal last year's record-breaking 23% growth, according to Reuters chief
executive officer Peter Job.  "Expect gentle reduction in this growth
rate...due to record sales back in mid-1994, when the market was very hot,"
Job told analysts at the Paine Webber Outlook For Media conference last month.

Reuters' sales are currently in a deceleration mode.  Job hinted that
full-year results will likely be less than the 17% growth posted for the first
nine months of 1995.  An annual growth rate of 15%-17% would bring Reuters'
1995 sales to between $4.14 billion and $4.21 billion.

Job described Reuters' 1996 revenue outlook as good, but said the company is
not assured of double-digit gains because of continuing consolidation in the
U.S.  financial market.  Reuters already has in place initiatives to reduce
1996 operating costs, in case the growth slowdown continues.

"Broadly, we feel we will have a reasonable set of financials for next year,"
he summarized.

Despite that forecast, Reuters continues to dominate the financial information
business.  Reuters' share of the $5.5 billion to $6.0 billion market has risen
from one-third to two-thirds, Job maintained.  Reuters generates 90% of its
revenue from information products, where it competes with Dow Jones Telerate,
Bloomberg and Knight-Ridder Financial.  Transaction products represent the
company's second-highest revenue generator.  Media products represent just six
percent of revenues.

International Expansion Targeted

In the next three to five years, Reuters will direct its growth efforts to
emerging financial markets such as Russia, China and especially Japan.
Reuters presently distributes financial information to 154 countries.  Only
one-third of these countries are mature markets, while the other two-thirds
represent growing or emerging markets with vast potential, Job explained.

To illustrate the growth opportunities in emerging markets, Job noted that the
average site in such markets has only two to three user accesses, while
developed countries average 10 accesses per site.  In Russia, for example,
Reuters seldom sees a competitor, and already enjoys "reasonable market share"
in China, Job noted.

New Business Information/Transaction Products

Reuters will also look to develop new business information/transaction
products for niche professional markets, like insurance and advertising and
marketing, where demand will come from managers who don't have access to their
competitors' financial statistics.

Specifically, Job pinpointed the insurance industry as a niche Reuters hopes
to target.  he also reaffirmed the company's commitment to providing
information for the advertising and media industry.  Reuters already owns a
20% stake in AdValue Media Technologies (EIR, Dec.  10, 1993).  "Contribution
[from niche professional markets] to sales growth, in my opinion, will quite
rapidly become material," Job said.

McGraw-Hill Companies More Innovative In '96, Dionne Says


Expect to see more innovation from The McGraw-Hill Companies in 1996, Joe
Dionne, MHC chairman and chief executive officer, told analysts at the Paine
Webber Outlook For Media conference last month.

"In the midst of all the talk of the software revolution and the information
superhighway, we believe that companies with content have a bright future
indeed," Dionne said.  The company believes that its breadth of content gives
it a distinct competitive advantage in the development of new electronic
services for businesses and consumers.

One year ago, MHC had not yet stated its Internet strategy (EIR, Jan.  6,
1995).  MHC has been cautious and slow to move to the World Wide Web.

New Electronic Products

So what's ahead for MHC in 1996?  The company is prepared to provide its
customers "with the information they want, in the form and frequency they
desire," Dionne said.

MHC will also enter the consumer market for the first time in 1996 with its
newly formed Home Interactive Division.  The company provided sparse details,
but expects to release its first group of electronic products for the 1996
holiday selling season, said Terry McGraw, MHC president and chief operating
officer.  In the corporate market, MHC is planning to create electronic
extensions of its existing product lines, especially World Wide Web services,
McGraw said.

1996 Will Be Challenging

While 1995 was a good year, Dionne said that 1996 "will be a more challenging
year," especially in the school sales area.  Despite these challenges, the
company expects "another year of double-digit increases," he said.

Financial services, which was an important part of MHC's growth in 1995, is
the company's fastest growing global business, said McGraw.  In particular,
MHC's Financial Services should see growth in the Far East.  Although
transaction volumes have been declining, sales increases are predicted in 1996
for Standard & Poor's Debt Ratings.

The company continues to develop new financial services products, including a
broader portfolio of risk evaluation products.  MHC launched its Bank Loans
Ratings products in June 1995 and is already generating new revenues from this
product, McGraw said.  "The rebound continues at MHC's DRI unit," which
performs econometric forecasting, according to McGraw.  He expects another
year of "progress and profitability."

Shepard's Faces A Tough Year

Within Educational and Professional Publishing, the company's largest revenue
generator, is Shepard's legal publishing unit.  Shepard's had a solid year in
1995 due to the release of its federal citator revision system, McGraw said.
However, Shepard's "faces a tough year in 1996," due to the planned sale of
the company's topical business, which will lop off $22 million in sales.
There won't be a new release of the popular citator revision system, he added.

Information and Media Services, which contains all of MHC's advertising-based
businesses, reversed four straight years of declining margins, McGraw said.
The company aims to improve margins again in 1996.  Business Week, the
company's largest ad revenue producer, also had an outstanding year.

Construction Information Better In '96

In 1995, there were "some signs of life" in the construction information
business, as the company continued to reshape this business (EIR, Jan.  6,
1995), McGraw said.  In the first 10 months of 1995, the construction industry
was up 1.0% from one year ago, he added.
