Mexico: Dual Citizenship and NAFTA</h2>

<ul>


<p>

The Mexican Senate and Chamber of Deputies approved legislation on

December 10, 1996 that would permit Mexicans who become naturalized US citizens

to retain their Mexican citizenship.  When two-thirds of Mexico's 31 state

legislatures approve dual citizenship, the new law will go into effect,

probably sometime in 1997.<p>

An estimated two million Mexican-born persons who have become naturalized

US citizens could recover their Mexican citizenship and 3.5 million other

Mexican-born persons in the US could become US citizens without losing their

Mexican citizenship.  Mexico has not yet decided how to deal with the tax and

military service obligations of citizens abroad, or whether to allow absentee

voting.<p>

Dual nationals are persons who owe allegiance to more than one country

because of birth, marriage, parentage or naturalization.  Each country develops

its own policies toward dual nationality.  <p>

The US government tolerates but does not advocate dual nationality.

<p>

A UCLA study concluded that "the impact on trade-related employment during

the first three years after NAFTA is estimated to be, at the very least, a near

zero net impact, and more likely, a moderately positive number" of about 2,900

net new US jobs since 1994.  However, there were 28,200 jobs lost to increased

imports and 31,200 jobs gained due to increased exports.<p>

Tehuixtla, Mexico, a village in the state of Puebla 140 miles southeast of

Mexico City, once again had annual visits from migrants who had moved to the

New York City area.  During most of the year, the village has about 200

residents, but at Christmas time, there are over 1,000.<p>

Remittances have financed construction of a stone church and a refurbished

hilltop shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe.  Many migrants have built

cement-and-tile houses that are crowned with satellite-dish antennas.<p>
