<H2>Land Grab Imperils Lacandon Territories</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>
Chiapas, Mexico: Spurred by a severe land shortage, Tzeltal Maya farmers are invading territory belonging to the Lacandon Maya, a 450-member indigenous group living in the Selva Lacandona region. CI Mexico's Victor Hugo Hernandez and his staff are assisting Mexican government officials and indigenous leaders in resolving this dispute. Although Mexican troops have moved to stop further seizure of Lacandon lands, the people are concerned that the "Naha invasion" will resume when the military leaves. In the words of one Lacandon Maya leader, "They have turned all their forest to pasture, and now they want the forest we have kept alive for our families."
<P>
CI's strategic interest centers on protecting the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve, which overlaps 90 percent of the Lacandon territory. Home to nearly half of Mexico's known biodiversity, the reserve is the largest remaining tract of primary rain forest in the country. Equally important to CI is helping to build local conservation capacity in communities surrounding the Montes Azules reserve. Since 1991, CI has worked with the Lacandon community, which is now struggling to hold on to its last ancestral lands and preserve its cultural identity.
<P>
The Tzeltal Maya invaders appear to be taking advantage of political unrest in the region instigated by the armed rebellion of the Zapatista National Liberation Army that began in early 1994, destroying more than 200 hectares of Lacandon Maya forest in a northern section of the Selva Lacandona. Over the past year, 
the Tzeltal have taken over another 2,000 hectares of Lacandon forest. Their extreme actions reflect the intense economic and land-use pressures that are crippling the region.</BLOCKQUOTE>
