<p>Computer Motion announced the formation of clinical development partnerships with The
 Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Penn State University’s Hershey Medical Center and Sarasota 
Memorial Hospital. These institutions have agreed to help perfect the company’s robotically
 assisted microsurgery systems and participate in the studies necessary for the systems to
 receive FDA clearance. These systems will be used in minimally invasive cardiac surgery 
procedures such as the Endoscopic Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (E-CABG), to allow multiple 
vessel coronary artery bypass grafting through holes smaller than the diameter of a pencil.</p>

<p>Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and most 
industrialized nations. More than 700,000 coronary artery bypass grafts and 200,000 heart
 valve replacements are performed annually worldwide. Greater than 99 percent of these 
procedures are performed as open-heart surgeries as today’s technology is not capable 
of supporting the clinical demands of a fully endoscopic surgical approach.</p>

<p>Computer Motion’s robotically assisted microsurgical systems enable surgeons to 
videoscopically perform delicate, precise surgical maneuvers through endoscopic ports. 
With the assistance of robotics, new procedures such as the E-CABG will be performed 
safely and with consistent high quality. Dr. Yulun Wang, Computer Motion’s Chief Technical 
Officer and Founder, believes that "computers and robotics can enhance the surgeon’s 
dexterity in the same way that the microscope enhances the surgeon’s ability to view
 the detail of small objects."</p>

<p>"We are seeing the proliferation of minimally invasive techniques in all the 
surgical specialties, including cardiac surgery. The benefits cannot be ignored – 
shorter hospital stays, decreased pain for patients and faster recovery times," 
said Joseph F. Hahn, MD, Chairman of The Cleveland Clinic Foundation’s Division of 
Surgery. "However, as we work with smaller incisions and smaller vessels, we test
 the limits of human physical capabilities and require the assistance of new technology, 
such as Computer Motion’s robotically assisted microsurgical systems." </p>

<p>"With conventional surgical instruments, we are not able to achieve an acceptable 
method for treating multiple vessel coronary artery disease in an endoscopic fashion," 
said Ralph J. Damiano, MD, Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Penn State University’s
 Hershey Medical Center. "However, with the advent of computer controlled medical 
robotics, we now have a platform of technology that will enable us to devise innovative 
minimally invasive procedures to reduce the morbidity and cost associated with these
 operations."</p>

<p>Thomas M. Krummel, MD, a John W. Oswald Professor and Chairman of the Department 
of Surgery at Penn State University’s Hershey Medical Center commented, "This builds
on our long standing commitment to technology development and validation to enhance 
our missions of patient care, education, research and service."</p>

<p>Michael Rowan, Chief Operating Officer of Sarasota Memorial Hospital, stated, 
"Over the past year we have studied the opportunities for realistic success in 
minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafts. We believe that robotic surgery 
offers the best opportunity to marry advanced technology with our surgeon’s skills
 to make the clinical leap to successful minimally invasive cardiac surgery that 
can be duplicated in centers around the country."</p>

<p>James L. Cox, MD, Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Washington University School of 
Medicine, said, "I believe that the use of robotically assisted microsurgical systems 
in minimally invasive cardiac surgery will advance our surgical capabilities far 
beyond anything that is now possible. Never has the future of cardiac surgery been 
more promising or exciting, largely because of innovations such as this one by 
Computer Motion."</p>

<p><i><b>Gene Wang</i></b></p>

<p>As we end 1996, Computer Motion has made considerable progress as a company. We have 
doubled our size, released a great new product  – AESOP 2000 with Voice Control  –  
and refined our vision for the coming years. Through these changes, our mission remains 
unchanged –  to enhance the surgeon’s capabilities, improve outcomes and reduce costs 
using computers and robotics. In the years ahead, we will expand our product line, 
while maintaining our focus on leadership in medical robotics.</p>

<p>Minimally invasive surgery, Computer Motion's primary target market, has 
experienced two explosive growth periods within the surgical subspecialties 
of arthroscopy and laparoscopy. Medical experts agree that the next huge MIS 
growth opportunity exists in the cardiac surgery market.</p>

<p>Computer Motion will enable the next frontier in MI cardiac surgery with 
robotically assisted microsurgical systems. These systems, code named "ZEUS", 
will empower surgeons to fully perform cardiac procedures endoscopically via 
improved anatomical access, enhanced patient-to-surgeon ergonomics and unparalleled 
dexterity and precision. The Company has partnered with some of the world’s leading 
heart institutions (see front page article) to perfect and commercialize these 
robotic systems.</p>

<p>In today’s managed care environment, OR's must become more efficient and 
less costly. Computer Motion will help optimize the OR by providing surgeons with 
an easy way to directly control their OR. The Company’s Surgeon Control Center, 
code named "HERMES", will integrate key medical devices in the OR into a network 
which can be commanded by the surgeon’s voice, mitigating the need for a member of 
the surgical team to manually control these devices.</p>

<p>We are excited about the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead as we evolve 
into the Operating Room of the Future. We remain committed to serving our customers
 around the world, and appreciate your continued support.</p>

</P>

<p>Computer Motion is committed to the development, marketing and support of advanced 
technologies that are shaping the Operating Room of the future. With AESOP 2000 we 
have successfully integrated several advanced technologies, including robotic enhancement,
 audio feedback and voice control. Going forward, we are aggressively developing new
 robotic and computer enhanced technologies for integration into future products. Our
 vision for the OR of the future includes the seamless integration of robotic tools
 to enhance the surgeon's capabilities, an intuitive and responsive surgeon-to-OR 
interface providing direct surgeon control, and an underlying information network 
which allows data from all OR devices to be shared.</p>

<p>The voice control interface of the AESOP 2000 enables the surgeon to use spoken 
commands to precisely position a laparoscope. Spoken language is the most natural 
and efficient form of human communication. Surgeons have overwhelmingly shown their
 preference for the voice interface and have demonstrated its efficiency in the OR
 using AESOP 2000. Although voice recognition technology has evolved to the point 
where a number of non-medical voice recognition products are commercially available,
 the design criteria for the surgical environment requires a unique combination of 
rapid recognition speed and reliability. As the first company to obtain clearance from 
the Food and Drug Administration for its custom OR compatible voice recognition software 
and hardware, Computer Motion is in fact the leader in this field.</p>

<p>Computer Motion is now applying its core technical competencies to develop a 
complete Surgeon Control Center for the OR of the future. This system will integrate
 numerous OR devices over the next few years, as part of the surgeon-to-OR interface.
 Devices that can be effectively integrated into this system include: cameras, light
 sources, insufflators, room lights, still recorders, video recorders and telephones.
 The Surgeon Control Center will make it possible to place these devices further from
 the surgical field, thus reducing clutter in the OR. Control and status information 
will be provided through a consistent and intuitive user interface and personnel 
movement within the OR will become more efficient. </p>

<p>The introduction of Computer Motion’s Surgeon Control Center will significantly 
enhance the surgeon’s relationship with the OR and the capabilities of OR devices 
by establishing a common user interface and information network. This represents 
an important step in the development of the OR of the Future.</p>

</P>

<p>AESOP 2000 is the world’s first FDA cleared, voice controlled surgical robot. It employs
 state-of-the-art speech recognition technology to raise the surgeon-to-machine interface 
to an unparalleled level. The voice control interface of AESOP 2000 dramatically 
decreases the learning curve for this sophisticated technology, placing its empowering 
benefits within the reach of every endoscopic surgeon.</p>

<p>Prior to using AESOP 2000, the surgeon participates in a brief training session 
to allow the system to adapt to the nuances of the surgeon's voice. The surgeon 
is prompted by the voice training computer to repeat the words that make up the 
AESOP command set (the lexicon). The data from this session is then synthesized 
to create models of the surgeon's voice and saved on a Personal Voice Card (PVC).</p>

<p>During use, the surgeon puts the robot in Command Mode by saying "AESOP." Once 
in Command Mode, the surgeon can verbally direct the laparoscope using one or more 
of the 25 verbal commands. During  minimally invasive procedures, this allows the
 surgeon to remain focused on the video monitor, while controlling the operative 
field of view.</p>

<p>Through the use of speech recognition technology, Computer Motion has brought 
the utility of robotics to every surgical suite. AESOP 2000 provides technology 
to truly enhance the surgeon's capabilities and empower the surgical team of 
the future.</p>

<p>Shaun Cleary, our Director of US Sales, identified his personal mission while in 
college, "To develop and deliver technology that improves the efficiency and efficacy
 of healthcare providers." His studies in medicine led him to the realization that 
there were significant challenges ahead in the healthcare field. He chose to partner 
with advanced technology to help meet those challenges. To gain a comprehensive grasp
 of the issues, Shaun studied healthcare economics, public health and hospital 
administration.</p>

<p>After graduating with a BS from the University of California at Berkeley, Shaun
 worked with American Hospital Supply followed by five exciting years with Pyxis
 Corporation. Shaun was the very first salesperson at Pyxis and was promoted to 
General Manager for the western states. </p>

<p>It is no surprise that Shaun is such a competent team player. At the University
 of California at Berkeley, he was an All American water polo player on a team that 
won two NCAA Championships. Shaun trained and competed with the US Olympic Water Polo
 Team for four years and helped his team win a Gold Medal at the Pan American Games
 in Indianapolis.</p>

<p>Shaun now leads our sales team at Computer Motion. In his own words,  "I am 
honored to be a part of this great team of talented people. I love the excitement 
and the problem solving associated with developing new solutions to challenges 
in healthcare." Shaun's enthusiasm, experience and vision will certainly aid in
 shaping new technology for the OR of the future.</p>

<p>Our Clinical Education Specialist for the mid-Atlantic region, Bronwyn 
(B.B.) Byron, RN, BSN, CNOR, received her BSN from the University of Maryland 
and began her nursing career in the US Army. She was stationed in Landstuhl, 
Germany, for three years, as Assistant Head Nurse of a very busy 
Orthopedic ward.</p>

<p>After she completed her active duty, B.B. returned home to Baltimore, 
Maryland and took her first OR position at Johns Hopkins Hospital, specializing 
in General Surgery and Urology. From there, she moved on to a smaller community 
setting where she held positions including Day-Shift Charge Nurse and Service 
Coordinator for Hand, Trauma and Reconstructive Surgery. In addition, B.B. 
performed preceptor duties, focusing on nurses without previous OR experience. 
She found this work particularly rewarding.</p>

<p>It was after a life-inspiring experience (a medical mission to Guyana, South America) 
that B.B. decided to leave the OR to broaden her professional horizons. Later, while 
she was coordinating a research project at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, B.B. 
became very interested in robotics and was invited to join the Computer Motion team.
 Her extensive OR experience and dedication to education have made her a valuable
 team member. In her own words, "I enjoy working with the surgical staff, being a 
resource to them and providing quality education for a quality product."</p>

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5><A NAME="Focus">Focus on Laparoscopic Sigmoid Colon Resection</A></FONT></B></CENTER>
</P>

<img src="lap.jpg" align=right align=absmiddle>

<p><i><b>Bronwyn Byron, RN, BSN, CNOR</i></b></p>

<p>Laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection is one of several laparoscopic bowel 
procedures being performed by general and colorectal surgeons today. Many 
laparoscopic techniques, drawn from the laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 
appendectomy, have been expanded and refined to be utilized in this complex
 procedure. These include intra-corporeal dissection, devascularization and 
anastomosis.</p>

<p><i><b>Benefits</i></b></p>

<p>The benefits of laparoscopic colon procedures are numerous compared to the
 traditional open colectomy. These include a faster return of bowel function 
and a rapid advancement towards a normal diet. Post operative pain is markedly 
decreased and encourages a more rapid return to normal activities. Improved 
cosmesis of the surgical site is also much appreciated by the patient. Ultimately, 
patients undergoing laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection have the opportunity 
to progress towards wellness significantly faster than patients who undergo the 
traditional open procedures.</p>

<p><i><b>Setup</i></b></p>

<p>For the laparoscopic sigmoid colon resection, the patient is in the lithotomy 
position and AESOP is placed at the left shoulder with a half tilt. Tilting AESOP
 is always completed prior to performing the Positioning Guide measurement and 
setting the Lower Limit. Tilting promotes maximum range of motion by increasing 
the clearance between AESOP's Elbow and the facial structures of the patient. 
Additional clearance can be attained by asking the anesthesia personnel to lower
 the profile of the patient's head by either removing (or using a smaller) pillow
 and turning the patient's head to the side. </p>

<p>Once Positioning Guide #1 is aligned over the optic port site and the Lower
 Limit is set, AESOP is ready for draping.</p>

<p>This procedure generally takes from 2 to 4 hours to complete, utilizing 
a surgical team of surgeon, first assistant, surgical technologist and AESOP. 
Rarely, the surgeon may reach the mechanical upper limit with AESOP (e.g., 
with very large patients). If and when this occurs, the solution is easy. 
Simply loosen the Collar and slide it down the laparoscope approximately 
2-4cms. Secure the collar in that location by tightening and then re-connect 
to AESOP. This will provide the necessary mobility to continue, resulting 
in a successful case.</p>

<p>The American Academy of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (AAGL, September 25-29, Chicago) 
and American College of Surgeons (ACS, October 7-11, San Francisco) meetings were 
successful platforms for the introduction of our premier product AESOP 2000. The 
Computer Motion booth, at both events, was very popular. The in-booth presentations
 during ACS were so crowded that the audience spilled out into the aisles. Many 
physicians took the opportunity to record their AESOP 2000 Personal Voice Cards 
at our Technology Suites which were open during the AAGL and ACS conventions.</p>

<p>Managing Today’s Operating Room Suite meetings (MTORS, September 11-13,
 Orlando and October 16-18, San Francisco) were also tremendous opportunities for
 surgical services directors and operating room managers to observe AESOP 2000. 
This year, for the first time, we attended the American Society for Reproductive
 Medicine conference (ASRM, November 2-6, Boston). We also exhibited at the 
Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons Endo Expo ’96 meeting
 (SLS, December 5-7, Orlando).</p>

<p>In early 1997, Computer Motion will exhibit at the Medicine Meets Virtual Reality
 Show (MMVR, January 21-25, San Diego) and the American Organization of Nurse 
Executives Meeting (AONE, February 22-24, Phoenix). Come visit us at one of these
 events.</p>

</P>  

<img src="earth.gif" align=right align=absmiddle width=100 height=100>

<p>1996 was a year of international growth for Computer Motion. Significant
 expansion occurred in the European and Asian markets with new market penetration 
as far south as Australia.</p>

<p>AESOP 2000 was featured during live surgical broadcasts at numerous 
prestigious international congresses. This included the International Meeting 
on Laparoscopic Surgery in Belgium where Dr. Luc Vanderheyden of Bruges, Belgium 
lead the world's first telesurgery between two countries. (Dr. Peter Go made the
 incision on the patient in Nieuwegein, in the Netherlands.) Professor L. Mettler
 of Kiel, Germany performed live pelviscopy at the Academy of Gynecological 
Endoscopists (AGE) held in Germany. </p>

<p>Live surgery utilizing AESOP 2000 was performed by Dr. Masahiro Ohgami at 
Keio Hospital and broadcast to the Japanese Society for Endoscopic Surgery 
(JSES) in Tokyo. Dr. Seigo Kitano of Oita assisted in the surgery from JSES 
via tele-mentoring using the AESOP Telesurgery system. Many presentations were
 given at these congresses by members of our Advisory Board and other highly
 regarded physicians on AESOP, telesurgery and the role of robotic technology 
in developing the OR of the future.</p>

<p>We continue to develop our relationships with several training centers, 
particularly focusing on the European Institute of Telesurgery (EITS) in 
Strasbourg, France and the European Surgical Institute (Ethicon) in
 Norderstedt, Germany.</p>

<p>International customers have been inquiring about the voice interface 
of AESOP 2000. Although the command set (the lexicon) of AESOP 2000 currently
 exists only in English, the AESOP 2000 system can still be used by our 
international customers. Our early experience with surgeons from European and
 Asian countries indicates that AESOP responds accurately to variable accented 
commands. The speaker dependent configuration of the technology allows for 
the variance in phonemes that other accents contribute to the commands. Provided
 that the speech pattern during the voice recording sessions is produced exactly
 as the surgeon will repeat those commands during surgery, accurate recognition 
is achievable. Additionally, Computer Motion plans to release foreign language
 versions of AESOP 2000 in the future. </p>
