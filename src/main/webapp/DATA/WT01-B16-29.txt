<p><hr>
  <body><h4>
  This past December, Linda Desell, Director of the
  Environmental and Operational Activities Division of the
  Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM),
  participated in a panel discussion on the topic of
  radioactive waste. The symposium, which took place at
  Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, was
  sponsored by the Greater Middletown League of Women Voters.
  In addition to Ms. Desell, who represented OCRWM at the
  symposium, panel participants included Marvin Resnikoff of
  Radioactive Waste Management Associates; Susan Wiltshere of
  J.K. Research Associates; and Professor Jelle de Boer of
  Wesleyan University's Environmental Sciences Department. The
  audience included the general public and members of the
  local League organization.
  <p>
  The panel spent the first half of the symposium defining the
  existing nuclear waste problem and discussing possible
  solutions to that problem. The second half of the discussion
  related to regulatory framework and policy issues, including
  the U.S. policy on high-level radioactive waste disposal and
  the currently "favored" solution to the waste-disposal
  problem (i.e., geologic disposal, as mandated by Congress).
  <p>
  The symposium concluded with a discussion on what citizens
  can do to become better educated and more informed of the
  problems related to the management and disposal of
  radioactive waste, and how they  can provide meaningful
  input in terms of helping to select the "best" solution to
  these problems.
