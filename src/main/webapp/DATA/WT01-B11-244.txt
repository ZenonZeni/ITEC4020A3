<p><b>SPERM INJECTION FOR SEVERE MALE INFERTILITY</b></p>
<p></p><p></p></center><p>One of the latest, and most exciting advances in treatment of infertility has been in the area of male factor problems.  Low numbers, poor quality, or absence of sperm have limited the ability to help the couple where the main cause of their infertility was the husband’s sperm.  In the past, these couples would have had to resort to donor sperm insemination, or adoption.</p>
<p>Today, it is possible to help these patients with the latest technology of <b>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injectin (ICSI)</b>. In this procedure, one sperm is injected directly into the egg allowing fertilization to occur.  Thus, minute amounts of sperm can be worked with, for one only needs enough sperm to inject the eggs available, i.e., 10 sperm if one has 10 eggs available.  Because of that, the Arizona Institute of Reproductive Medicine can help couples where:</p>
<ul>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men have had vasectomies (tubes tied)<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men born without a vas (the tube from the testicle to the outside)<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men with failed vas reversals<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men with extremely low counts<br>
<img src= i_mgmt/redbut.gif width=20 heigth=20>  men with Sertoli Cell Only Syndrome<br>
</ul></center>
<p>It is important to understand that there are many ways to perform sperm counts.  Most commercial laboratories do not spend the time needed to locate minute amounts of sperm.  We have several patients that have been told that they did not have sperm, when in truth, we have located sufficient sperm to allow us to achieve pregnancies via <b>Intracytolplasmic Sperm Injection</b>.</p>

<p>The technology of <b>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)</b> was introduced by us in Arizona in 1993. <b>Our success rate in 1995 using ICSI shows the 57% of mature eggs captured fertilized normally, resulting in an ongoing pregnancy rate in women less than 40 of 50%</b>.  We have obtained <b>sperm directly from the testicle by either sperm aspiration or testicular biopsy</b> done in the office and successfully fertilized 42% of eggs injected.  Our first set of <b><u>twins</b></u> recently delivered and celebrated Father’s Day with their dad.</p>

<p>If you believe that a male factor fertility problem exists, call our office for further information, or come visit us and see the modern facility that is here to help you.</p></center>
