<p>
A Case Western Reserve University law professor filed suit today in
federal court, challenging government regulations which restrict his
ability to teach a course in computer law.  Peter Junger, a twenty-five
year veteran of the law school faculty, filed a federal civil rights
action this morning in the United States District Court in Cleveland. 
The suit names the Department of State and the secretive National
Security Agency, which administer federal regulations limiting
Professor Junger's ability to teach.

<p>

The case involves federal regulations which restrict the export of
military arms.  Under federal law, computer software which encodes
messages to preserve the privacy of messages on the Internet can be
declared a military export.  The regulations are so strict that even
discussing the technical aspects of such software in the presence of
foreign nationals may be a felony, punishable by up to ten years in
prison.  Professor Junger, whose class at Case Western Reserve focuses
on the legal aspects of computer use and software development, plans to
turn away any foreign students who register for the course this fall,
largely because the law is uncertain as to what he may teach, and to
whom.


<p>
The restrictions at issue are administered by the Department of State,
in cooperation with the ultra-secret National Security Agency, the
organization charged with eavesdropping on foreign governments.   


<p>
Under the restrictions, Junger may not teach foreign students about
even simple software capable of encoding messages.  Such software is
vital to maintaining the privacy of communications and financial
transactions on the Internet, and Junger believes that lawyers need to
understand how it works in order to prepare to practice in an
increasingly technological world.


<p>
The information that Junger wishes to disclose is widely available on
the Internet and elsewhere.  "It's not as though we are talking about
classified information,"  explained Gino Scarselli, one of three
lawyers representing Junger in the case.  "The material at issue in
this case can be found in any university library,  but the regulations
make no exceptions for even the most basic software,"  Scarselli noted.
  The lawsuit does not challenge the government's right to restrict
access to classified information.


<p>
Junger is also represented by Raymond Vasvari and Kevin Francis
O'Neill, two Cleveland attorneys with considerable experience in First
Amendment issues.   As Vasvari explained, the suit presents important
First Amendment questions about the government's ability to regulate
academic life.  "These regulations allow the government to dictate what
a professor may and may not teach, even though the material involved
poses no threat to national security," Vasvari explained.  


<p>
The suit charges that by requiring Junger to apply for a federal
license to discuss cryptography with foreigners, the government is
violating a well-established First Amendment rule which prohibits the
government from licensing expression.  


<p>
Because computer cryptography is expected to play an important role in
the economic development of the Internet, the case is being closely
watched by industry leaders in the Silicon Valley.  Scarselli has
worked closely with attorneys affiliated with the San Francisco based
Electronic Frontier Foundation in preparing the suit, and Junger and
his lawyers have  been in frequent contact with founder John Gilmore,
formerly of Sun Microsystems, who has offered his assistance as a
technical advisor in the case.
