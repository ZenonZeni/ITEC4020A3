<P>
All parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, from uranium mining and preparing fuel for use, through use of the fuel to generate electricity, to management of used fuel and decommissioning, produce some radioactive waste.  This waste comprises a diversity of materials with different physical, chemical and radioactive characteristics, requiring different types of management. 
<P>The broad characteristics of radioactive waste that affect what effects it could have and how it should be managed are: 
<UL>
<LI>how long the radioactivity lasts (the content of short or long-lived radionuclides)
<LI>the concentration of the radionuclides, (high, medium or low level)
<LI>whether it is heat generating or not (which is related to the concentration of the radionuclides)
</UL>
The length of life of the radioactivity determines how long it has to be managed.  The concentration of the radionuclides and whether it is heat generating dictates how it should be handled:  how much, if any, shielding is needed.  These considerations together determine what ways of disposal are suitable. 
<P>
The main categories of waste from the nuclear fuel cycle are: 
<OL TYPE=i, ii, iii, ...>
<LI>The residues left from processing uranium ore.  These contain naturally occurring radioactive elements mined with the uranium, and some chemicals used in the separation process.  The radioactivity is low level but long-lived. 
<LI>The materials and equipment (for example protective clothing, cleaning materials, ion-exchange resins) which become contaminated during the operation of nuclear facilities.  The radioactivity is mainly low level and short-lived. 
<LI>The wastes arising from nuclear fuel after it has been used in a reactor.  These can be the used fuel itself if it is not reprocessed or the wastes resulting from reprocessing the used fuel so that it can be recycled for reuse.  Used fuel that is not to be reprocessed can be regarded as high level, long-lived waste.  Reprocessing wastes are a mixture of high, intermediate and low level wastes, including long-lived intermediate level wastes:  the mixture depends on the treatment techniques used. 
<LI>The wastes resulting from dismantling nuclear reactors after the fuel has been removed and from fuel processing plants at the end of their operating lives.  The radioactivity is low and intermediate level and mainly relatively short-lived.  There will be some long-lived waste from dismantling reprocessing plants. 
</OL>
The high level wastes in category iii account for almost all (some 99 per cent) of the radioactivity produced by nuclear electricity generation, but a very small proportion of the total volume of waste, which is itself very small (especially if there is reprocessing) in comparison to wastes from other forms of thermal electricity generation.  Since it is such a small volume, it can be effectively and economically isolated.  The long-lived but low level wastes from processing uranium ore account for most of the volume of all radioactive wastes - 50 to 100 times as much as the rest - but very little of the radioactivity.
<P>
Additional civilian radioactive wastes arise from medicine, industry and research.  These may be very heterogeneous and can contain long-lived radionuclides.
<P>
An important reason why the volume of all waste from use of nuclear power is small in comparison to that from other forms of thermal electricity generation is that nuclear power produces very much more energy from a given amount of fuel.  A pellet of nuclear fuel less than a centimetre in diameter and one and a half centimetres long has about as much energy available as over 450 cubic metres of natural gas or one tonne of coal;  and a 1300 MWe coal fired power plant would use over 50 000 times the tonnage of fuel it would need if it were nuclear powered.  This more than outweighs the fact that production and use of coal generates less solid waste per tonne of fuel.  (The very large amount of greenhouse gases from production and use of fossil fuels and the negligible amount from production and use of nuclear fuel are not taken into account.)
<P>
All countries manage the different kinds of waste to take full account of their characteristics, but the classifications they use for the waste differ somewhat in accordance with the systems they use.  Since this may be causing some confusion to the public, standardised international waste classifications could be helpful in explaining what is being done and why it is consistent between countries in achieving the same goals. 
<P>It is helpful that a <A HREF="http://www.nea.fr/html/rwm/geodisp.html">Collective Opinion</A> on the methodology and means for assessing the safety of radioactive waste disposal practices and concepts has been arrived at and published by the Radioactive Waste Management Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA) and the International Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), with the endorsement of the experts for the Community Plan of Action in the Field of Radioactive Waste Management of the Commission of the European Communities (CEC).
<P>
<B>The Collective Opinion:</B>
<UL>
<LI>confirmed that safety assessment methods are available today to evaluate adequately the potential long-term radiological impacts of a carefully designed radioactive waste disposal system on humans and the environment, and
<LI>considered that appropriate use of safety assessment methods, coupled with sufficient information from proposed disposal sites, can provide the technical basis to decide whether specific disposal systems would offer to society a satisfactory level of safety for both current and future generations.
