OPINION: OPINION<p>
<p>
   Proposition 187 is an initiative measure which was submitted to the voters
of the State of California in the November 8, 1994 general election. It was
passed by a vote of 59% to 41% and became effective the following day. The
stated purpose of Proposition 187 is to "provide for cooperation between [the]
agencies of state and local government with the federal government, and to
establish a system of required notification by and between such agencies to
prevent illegal aliens in the United States from receiving benefits or public
services in the State of California."  Prop. 187,  @ 1. The initiative's
provisions require law enforcement, social services, health care and public
education personnel to (I)  verify the immigration status of persons with whom
they come in contact; (ii)  notify certain defined persons of their immigration
status; (iii) report those persons to state and federal officials; and (iv)
deny those persons social services, health care, and education.<p>
<p>
   After the initiative was passed, several actions challenging the
constitutionality of Proposition 187 were commenced in state and  federal
courts in California. Ultimately, five actions filed in the United States
District Court were consolidated in this Court for purposes of motions,
hearings, petitions and trial (collectively, the consolidated actions"). n1

Superintendent of the Alhambra Unified School District Heber Meeks.  Gregorio
T. plaintiffs also named Dawson (who was replaced by Eastin);  Anderson;
Belshe; individuals who are the members of the California State Board of
Education, in their official capacities; individuals who are the Regents of the
University of California, in their official capacities; Jack Peltason,

<p>
   On May 1, 1995, the League of United Latin American Citizens ("LULAC") and
Gregorio T. plaintiffs brought motions for summary judgment in which they
contend that Proposition 187 is unconstitutional on the sole ground that the
initiative is preempted by the federal government's exclusive constitutional
authority over the regulation of immigration, Congress' exercise of that power
through the Immigration and Nationality Act ("INA"), and other federal
statutes. n5 n6 Defendants n7 oppose the LULAC and  Gregorio T. motions on the
grounds that Proposition 187 is not preempted and, alternatively, that if any
portion of the initiative is preempted, the remaining portions are valid and
must be upheld.<p>

summary judgment motions based on preemption as well, on May 12, 1995 and May
16, 1995, respectively. Catholic Hospitals and Islamic Center each joined in
the other's motion.<p>
<p>
   To the extent that those motions are brought on grounds other than those
raised in the LULAC and Gregorio T. motions, they are denied. To the extent
that those motions rely on the same arguments raised in the LULAC and Gregorio

<p>
I. Purpose and Effect of Proposition 187<p>
<p>
   Proposition 187 consists of ten sections: a preamble (section 1), a section
pertaining to the amendment and severability of the initiative (section 10) and
eight substantive sections (sections 2-9). n8 Within the eight substantive
sections of the initiative, there are the following five types of provisions:<p>
<p>
(1) provisions which require state officials to verify or determine the
immigration status of arrestees, applicants for social services and health
care,  and public school students and their parents, by either classifying
persons based on state-created categories of immigration status (the
"classification" provisions) or verifying immigration status by reference to
federal immigration laws (the "remaining verification" provisions) ( Prop. 187
@@ 4(b); 5(b), (c);  6(b), (c); 7(a)-(e); 8(a)-(c)) n9;<p>
<p>
(2) provisions which require state officials to notify individuals that they
are apparently present in the United States unlawfully and that they must
"either obtain legal status or leave the United States" (the "notification"
provisions)  ( Prop. 187  @@ 4(b)(2); 5(c)(2); 6(c)(2));<p>
<p>
(3) provisions which require state agencies to report immigration status
information to state and federal authorities, and to cooperate with the INS
regarding persons whose immigration status is suspect (contained in Sections
4-9) (the cooperation/reporting"   provisions) ( Prop. 187  @@ 4(b)(3);
5(c)(3); 6(c)(3); 7(e); 8(c); 9);<p>
<p>
(4) provisions which require facilities to deny social services, health care
services and public education to individuals based on immigration status (the
"benefit denial" provisions) ( Prop. 187  @@ 5(b), (c)(1); 6(b), (c)(1);
7(a)(c); 8(a)-(b)); and  (5) criminal penalties for falsifying immigration
documents ( Prop. 187  @@ 2,  3).<p>

   n8 The eight substantive sections of the statute are codified as follows:
Section 2 is codified at Cal. Penal Code @ 113. Section 3 is codified at Cal
Penal. Code @ 114. Section 4 is codified at Cal. Penal Code @ 834b. Section 5
is codified at Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code @ 10001.5. Section 6 is codified at
Cal.  Health &amp; Safety Code @ 130. Section 7 is codified at Cal. Educ. Code
@ 48215.  Section 8 is codified at Cal. Educ. Code @ 66010.8.<p>
<p>
   For the purposes of this Opinion, the initiative's provisions are referred
to by their initiative section numbers rather than by their California code
section numbers (i.e., Cal. Penal Code @ 834b(a) is referred to as section
4(a)").<p>
n9 The verification provisions are of two types. The first type requires state
agents to classify persons based on three state-created categories of "legal
status" without any reference to federal immigration laws. Specifically,  state
agents must determine who is a "citizen" and who is "lawfully admitted" as a
permanent resident or for a temporary period of time. @@ 5(b); 6(b); 7(d).
These provisions are referred to collectively as "classification" provisions.
The remaining verification provisions contain a "catch-all" category exempting
from Proposition 187's denial of benefits, notification and reporting
provisions persons who are otherwise lawfully present in the United States
under federal law. @@ 4(b)(1); 5(c); 6(c); 7(b), (c); 8(b). These provisions
are referred to collectively as the remaining verification" provisions.<p>

-<p>
<p>
   The initiative has a dual purpose and effect. The classification,
notification and cooperation/reporting provisions taken together constitute a
regulatory scheme designed to deter illegal aliens from entering or remaining
in the United States by (1) detecting those persons  present in the United
States in violation of either state-created criteria for lawful immigration
status or federal immigration laws; (2) notifying those persons of their
purported unlawful status and ordering them to obtain legal status or leave the
country; and (3) maintaining a system of reporting and cooperation between
state and federal agencies to effect the removal of those persons. These
provisions cannot be read except as a regulatory scheme; and indeed, defendants
have not seriously urged any other reading. While the benefits denial
provisions also have the purpose of deterring illegal aliens from entering or
remaining in the United States, and arguably may be viewed as part of the same
regulatory scheme, they have the additional purpose of forbidding the use of
public funds to provide social services, health care and education to persons
deemed to be present in the United States illegally.<p>
<p>
II. Severability of the Initiative<p>
<p>
   In determining the validity of Proposition 187, the Court is mindful of its
obligation to uphold the initiative to the fullest extent possible. California
law holds that "all presumptions favor the validity of initiative measures and
mere  doubts as to validity are insufficient." Legislature v. Eu,  54 Cal. 3d
492, 501, 286 Cal. Rptr. 283, 287, 816 P.2d 1309 (1991).  Initiatives "must be
upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably
appears." Id. A finding that a section, subsection or subpart of Proposition
187 is preempted by federal law does not end the Court's inquiry with respect
to the validity of the initiative. Rather, a finding that any provision is
preempted requires the Court to determine whether that provision is severable
from the balance of the initiative so that the remainder may take effect. See
Calfarm Ins. Co. v. Deukmejian, 48 Cal. 3d 805, 821, 258 Cal.  Rptr. 161, 170,
771 P.2d 1247 (1989) (a holding that a subdivision of an initiative is invalid
under the state and federal Constitutions requires a determination as to
whether the invalid provision is severable from the initiative). Whether any
preempted provision of Proposition 187 is severable from the remainder of the
initiative is determined pursuant to California law. National Broiler Council
v. Voss, 44 F.3d 740, 748 n.12 (9th Cir. 1994).<p>
<p>
   Section 10 of Proposition 187 provides:<p>
<p>
In the event  that any portion of this act or the application thereof to any
person or circumstance is held invalid, that invalidity shall not affect any
other provision or application of the act, which can be given effect without
the invalid provision or application, and to that end the provisions of this
act are severable.<p>
<p>
"'Although not conclusive, a severability clause normally calls for sustaining
the valid part of the enactment, especially when the invalid part is
mechanically severable . . . [citation]'"  Calfarm, 48 Cal. 3d at 821, 258 Cal.
Rptr. at 170 (citation omitted). The existence of a severability clause does
not conclusively resolve the severability inquiry, however. Rather, "the final
determination depends on whether 'the remainder . . . is complete in itself and
would have been adopted by the legislative body had the latter foreseen the
partial invalidity of the statute . . .' and 'is not so connected with the rest
of the statute as to be inseparable.'" Santa Barbara Sch. Dist. v. Superior
Court, 13 Cal. 3d 315, 331, 118 Cal. Rptr. 637, 650, 530 P.2d 605 (1975)
(citations omitted).<p>
<p>
   California courts have prescribed three criteria by which a reviewing court
must assess the severability of invalid provisions of statutes. In order to be
severable, "the invalid provision must be grammatically,  functionally, and
volitionally separable." Calfarm, 48 Cal. 3d at 821,  258 Cal. Rptr. at 170. A
provision is grammatically severable if "it constitutes a distinct and separate
provision . . . which can be removed as a whole without affecting the wording
of any other provision," 48 Cal. 3d at 822, 258 Cal. Rptr. at 170, or "where
the valid and invalid parts can be separated by paragraph, sentence, clause,
phrase or even single words." Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal. 3d at 330, 118
Cal. Rptr. at 649. However, where "the defect cannot be cured by excising any
word or group of words, the problem is quite different," and severance is
inappropriate. Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal. 3d at 331, 118 Cal. Rptr. at
649.<p>
<p>
   A provision is functionally severable if the remaining provisions can "stand
on their own," are capable of "separate enforcement," People's Advocate, Inc.
v. Superior Court, 181 Cal. App. 3d 316, 331-32, 226 Cal. Rptr.  640, 649
(1986), can be "given effect," Raven v. Deukmejian, 52 Cal. 3d 336, 355, 276
Cal. Rptr. 326, 338, 801 P.2d 1077 (1990), or can operate . . . independently"
of the invalid provisions. Eu, 54 Cal. 3d at 535, 286 Cal. Rptr. at 310. The
remaining provisions must neither be "rendered vague" by the absence of the
invalid provisions nor "inextricably connected to them by policy
considerations." People's Advocate, 181 Cal.  App. 3d at 332, 226 Cal. Rptr. at
649.<p>
<p>
   Finally, an invalid provision is volitionally severable if the remaining
provisions "would likely have been adopted by the people had they foreseen the
invalidity" of the challenged provision, or if the provision was not "so
critical to the enactment of [the initiative] that the measure would not have
been enacted in its absence." Calfarm, 48 Cal. 3d at 822, 258 Cal. Rptr.  at
170. Stated differently, the test [for volitional severability] is whether it
can be said with confidence that the electorate's attention was sufficiently
focused upon the parts to be severed so that it would have separately
considered and adopted them in the absence of the invalid portions." People's
Advocate, 181 Cal. App. 3d at 333, 226 Cal. Rptr. at 650. Under the volitional
severability test, even if the "'heart of [the] proposition'"  is found
invalid, if some "'substantive provisions remain,'" the invalid part should be
severed to enforce the valid provisions and achieve at least "some substantial
portion of [the voters'] purpose." Gerken v. Fair Political Practices Co., 6
Cal. 4th 707, 714-15, 25 Cal. Rptr. 2d 449, 457, 863 P.2d 694 (1993)  (quoting
City of Woodlake v. Logan, 230 Cal. App. 3d 1058, 1070, 282 Cal. Rptr. 27
(1991); Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal. 3d at 332, 118 Cal. Rptr. at 650).<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs contend that Proposition 187 is not severable because its
"pervasive unconstitutionality" leaves nothing to salvage. In addition, they
argue that the provisions of the initiative fail to meet the three criteria for
severability. They contend, for example, that the classification provisions are
not grammatically severable because their absence would render the remaining
verification provisions unintelligible. They argue that none of the
verification provisions are functionally severable because their absence would
render the denial of benefits provisions inoperable. Finally, they argue that
the notification and reporting provisions are not volitionally severable from
the benefits denial provisions because the intention of the electorate in
passing the initiative was to enact a comprehensive scheme to "stop illegal
aliens," and severing the notification and reporting provisions to salvage the
benefits denial provisions would frustrate the electorate's intent.<p>
<p>
   Defendants counter that the initiative meets all three severability tests.
That is, defendants argue that the initiative is volitionally severable because
the severability clause reflects the electorate's intent to accept the
implementation of any valid provisions notwithstanding the invalidation of
others, grammatically severable because each section, subsection and subpart of
the initiative can be severed from the others without rendering remaining
sections unintelligible and functionally severable because each section,
subsection and subpart is capable of operating independently from the others.<p>
<p>
   Before analyzing the severability of each of the challenged provisions of
Proposition 187, two general comments on the grammatical and volitional
severability of the initiative as a whole are warranted. First, defendants are
correct that each of Proposition 187's ten sections, and their respective
subsections, is a distinct grammatical unit and thus is capable of being
severed from the other sections and subsections without affecting the wording
of any other section or rendering what remains unintelligible.  Accordingly,
any section or subsection within Proposition 187 which is found to be invalid
is grammatically severable from the remainder of the initiative.<p>
<p>
   Second, defendants are also correct that the initiative is volitionally
severable. Plaintiffs' contention to the contrary -- that, for example, the
denial of benefits or criminal penalties provisions would not have been adopted
had the people foreseen the success of challenges to the reporting and
notification provisions -- is unavailing. Proposition 187's declaration intent
explicitly states that a substantial purpose of the initiative is to "prevent
illegal aliens in the United States from receiving benefits or public services
in the State of California." @ 1. Elsewhere in the initiative it is stated that
it is "the intention of the People of California that only citizens of the
United States and aliens lawfully admitted . . . may receive the benefits" of
public social services, health care, and education. @@ 5(a); 6(a);  7(a); 8(a).
Further, "even though . . . the full purpose of [the  initiative] cannot be
realized, it seems eminently reasonable to suppose that those who favor the
proposition would be happy to achieve at least some substantial portion of
their purpose." Santa Barbara Sch. Dist., 13 Cal.  3d at 331-32, 118 Cal. Rptr.
at 650. It cannot be disputed that the denial of benefits to "illegal aliens"
(in sections 5 through 8) and the criminalization of the manufacture and use of
false immigration documents (in sections 2 and 3)  serve a significant part of
the initiative's purpose. The Court is therefore convinced that if the voters
had known that some of the initiative's provisions would be held invalid, they
would have preferred the implementation of the remaining portions, rather than
the invalidation of the entire initiative. Any provisions of Proposition 187
found to be invalid are volitionally severable from the remainder.<p>
<p>
   Thus, the provisions of Proposition 187 which are preempted must be severed
from the initiative. A copy of the initiative as severed in accordance withthis
Opinion follows in Appendix B. The Court's preemption analysis follows.<p>
<p>
III. Whether Proposition 187 is Preempted   Under Federal Law<p>
<p>
   The question of whether provisions of Proposition 187 are preempted by
federal law is governed by the Supreme Court's decision in De Canas v.  Bica,
424 U.S. 351, 47 L. Ed. 2d 43, 96 S. Ct. 933 (1976) (California statute
prohibiting an employer from knowingly employing an alien who is not entitled
to lawful residence in the United States held not preempted under federal law).
In De Canas, the Supreme Court set forth three tests to be used in determining
whether a state statute related to immigration is preempted. Pursuant to De
Canas, if a statute fails any one of the three tests, it is preempted by
federal law.<p>
<p>
   Under the first test, the Court must determine whether a state statute is a
"regulation of immigration." Since the "power to regulate immigration is
unquestionably exclusively a federal power, id. at 354, any state statute which
regulates immigration is "constitutionally proscribed."  Id. at 356.<p>
<p>
   Under the second test, even if the state law is not an impermissible
regulation of immigration, it may still be preempted if there is a showing that
it was the "clear and manifest purpose of Congress to effect a "complete ouster
of state power -- including state power to promulgate laws not in conflict with
federal laws" with respect to the subject matter which the statute attempts to
regulate. Id. at 357. In other words, under the second test, a statute is
preempted where Congress intended to "occupy the field" which the statute
attempts to regulate.<p>
<p>
   Under the third test, a state law is preempted if it "stands as an obstacle
to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of
Congress. Id. at 363 (citing  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52,  67, 85 L. Ed.
581, 61 S. Ct. 399 (1941)). Stated differently, a statute is preempted under
the third test if it conflicts with federal law making compliance with both
state and federal law impossible. Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers v.
Agricultural Marketing and Bargaining Board, 467 U.S. 461, 469, 81 L. Ed. 2d
399, 104 S. Ct. 2518 (1984); Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers v.  Paul, 373
U.S. 132, 142-43, 10 L. Ed. 2d 248, 83 S. Ct. 1210 (1963).<p>
<p>
   A. Whether Proposition 187 Constitutes an Impermissible Regulation of
Immigration.<p>
<p>
   The federal government possesses the exclusive power to regulate
immigration. De Canas, 424 U.S. at 354-355 ("Power to regulate immigration is
unquestionably exclusively a federal power.") That power derives from the
Constitution's grant to the federal government of the power to "establish a
uniform Rule of Naturalization," U.S. Const. art. I, @ 8, cl. 4., and to
"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations." Id., cl. 3. In addition, the Supreme
Court has held that the federal government's power to control immigration is
inherent in the nation's sovereignty. See, e.g., Nishimura Ekiu v.  United
States, 142 U.S. 651, 659, 35 L. Ed. 1146, 12 S. Ct. 336 (1892)  (recognizing
inherent power of sovereign nation to control its borders);  Plyler v. Doe, 457
U.S. 202, 225, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 102 S. Ct. 2382  (1982) ("Drawing upon [its
Article I, section 8] power, upon its plenary authority with respect to foreign
relations and international commerce, and upon the inherent power of a
sovereign to close its borders, Congress has developed a complex scheme
governing admission to our Nation and status within our borders");  Fiallo v.
Bell, 430 U.S. 787, 792, 52 L. Ed. 2d 50, 97 S. Ct.  1473 (1977) ("Our cases
'have long recognized the power to expel or exclude aliens as a fundamental
sovereign  attribute exercised by the Government's political departments . .
.'" (citation omitted).<p>
<p>
   Congress has exercised its power over immigration in the Immigration and
Naturalization Act, 8 U.S.C. @ 1101 et seq. (the "INA"). The INA is a
comprehensive regulatory scheme which regulates the authorized entry, length of
stay, residence status and deportation of aliens. See Gonzales v. City of
Peoria, 722 F.2d 468, 474-75 (9th Cir. 1983) (recognizing that the regulatory
scheme created by the INA is so pervasive as to be consistent with the
exclusive federal power over immigration). The INA delegates enforcement duties
to the Immigration and Naturalization Service ("INS").<p>
<p>
   Because the federal government bears the exclusive responsibility for
immigration matters, the states "can neither add to nor take from the
conditions lawfully imposed by Congress upon admission, naturalization and
residence of aliens in the United States or the several states." Takahashi v.
Fish &amp; Game Comm'n, 334 U.S. 410, 419, 92 L. Ed. 1478, 68 S. Ct. 1138
(1948). See also  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 at 225, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 102 S.
Ct. 2382  (1982) ("The States enjoy no power with respect to the classification
of aliens." (citing Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 85 L. Ed. 581, 61 S. Ct.
399 (1941).<p>
<p>
   In De Canas, in reasserting the rule that "power to regulate immigration is
unquestionably exclusively a federal power," the Supreme Court emphasized that
the mere fact that a state statute pertains to aliens does not require a
finding  that it is preempted: "the Court has never held that every state
enactment which in any way deals with aliens is a regulation of immigration and
thus per se preempted by this constitutional power . . ." 424 U.S. at 355. The
Court stressed that "the fact that aliens are the subject of a state statute
does not render it a regulation of immigration, which is essentially a
determination of who should or should not be admitted into the country, and the
conditions under which a legal entrant may remain." 424 U.S. at 355.<p>
<p>
   In this case, plaintiffs urge that the entirety of Proposition 187
constitutes a scheme to regulate immigration and is therefore preempted. They
assert that the initiative as a whole is a regulation of immigration because it
forces state employees to make judgments as to an individual's immigration
status, gives them the power to effectuate removal of immigrants from the
country and thereby establishes California's own INS. Defendants counter that
pursuant to De Canas, "regulation of immigration" has a "narrow, technical
meaning"; that a facial challenge to this statute requires a "painstaking
line-by-line analysis" of the statute; and that such analysis reveals that,
standing alone, none of Proposition 187's individual sections or subsections is
"essentially a determination of who should or should not be admitted into the
country and on what terms those lawfully admitted can remain here." De Canas,
424 U.S. at 355.<p>
<p>
   In De Canas, the statute at issue provided that "no employer shall knowingly
employ an alien who is not entitled to lawful residence in the United States if
such employment would have an adverse effect on lawful resident workers." Id.
at 352 n. 1; Cal. Lab. Code @ 2805. Noting that in that case,  California had
"sought to strengthen its economy by adopting federal standards in imposing
criminal sanctions against state employers who knowingly employ aliens who have
no federal right to employment within the country," the Supreme Court found
that the statute did not constitute an immigration regulation, but rather, had
only "some purely speculative and indirect impact on immigration." Id. at
355.<p>
<p>
   Unlike the statute at issue in De Canas, various of Proposition 187's
provisions have much more than a "purely speculative and indirect impact on
immigration." Indeed, Proposition 187's verification, notification and
cooperation/reporting requirements directly regulate immigration by creating a
comprehensive scheme to detect and report the presence and effect the removal
of illegal aliens. The scheme requires state agents to question all arrestees,
applicants for medical and social services, students, and parents of students
about their immigration status; to obtain and examine documents relating to the
immigration status of such persons; to identify "suspected" "illegal"
immigrants present in California; to report suspected "illegal" immigrants to
state and federal authorities; and to instruct people suspected of being in the
United States illegally to obtain "legal status" or "leave the country." Thus,
Proposition 187's scheme has a direct and substantial impact on immigration.<p>
<p>
   Further, certain of Proposition 187's provisions require state agents to
make independent determinations of who is subject to the initiative's benefits
denial, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions and who may lawfully
remain in the United States. Unlike the statute at issue in De Canas, which
adopted federal standards to determine whether an individual's immigration
status subjected an employer to liability, Proposition 187's classification
provisions create an entirely independent set of criteria by which to classify
individuals based on immigration status. See, e.g.,  Prop. 187  @@ 5(b); 6(b);
7(d).<p>
<p>
   On the other hand, the benefits denial provisions of sections 5 through 8
may be likened to the statute at issue in De Canas. While the denial of
benefits to persons not lawfully present in the United States may indirectly or
incidentally affect immigration by causing such persons to leave the state or
deterring them from entering California in the first place, such a denial does
not amount to a "determination of who should or should not be admitted into the
country." De Canas, 424 U.S. at 355. Accordingly, the benefits denials
provisions are not impermissible regulations of immigration and thus are not
preempted under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   It is true, as plaintiffs argue, that benefits denial can only occur after
an applicant's legal status has been "determined." That is, absent
verification process, eligibility for benefits based on immigration status
would be impossible. Moreover, state agents are unqualified--and also
unauthorized--to make independent determinations of immigration status.
Congress has exclusively reserved that power to the INS and to immigration
judges pursuant to the INA. See  8 U.S.C. @ 1252(b); 8 C.F.R. @ 242.1(a).
Indeed, determinations of immigration status by state agents amounts to
immigration regulation whether made for the purposes of notifying aliens of
their unlawful status and reporting their presence to the INS or for the
limited purpose of denying benefits.<p>
<p>
   Defendants contend that because state agents are required to and do make
determinations of immigration status in administering benefits under certain
federal-state cooperative programs, eligibility for which Congress has
conditioned on lawful immigration status, such determinations may also be made
by state agents for purposes of denying benefits under Proposition 187. Indeed,
the Systematic Alien Verification for  Entitlements program ("SAVE"),  42
U.S.C. @ 1320b-7, is an existing federal eligibility system used to verify
status for various federal-state cooperative programs such as the Aid to
Families with Dependent Children ("AFDC"), Food Stamps, Medicaid and
Unemployment Compensation programs under which eligibility is dependent on
lawful immigration status. See  42 U.S.C. @ 1320b-7(b)(1) and 45 C.F.R. @
233.50 (AFDC); 42 U.S.C. @@ 1320b-7(b)(2) and 1396b(v)(1) (Medicaid);<p>
7 U.S.C. @ 2015(f) and 42 U.S.C. @ 1320b-7(b)(4) (Food Stamps). These benefits
programs require state agents to verify immigration status by accessing federal
immigration status information through SAVE. In administering state-federal
cooperative benefits programs, however, state agents perform a ministerial
rather than a discretionary function in verifying immigration status. That is,
state agents merely access INS information to verify an applicant's immigration
status -- no independent determinations are made and no state-created criteria
are applied. A requirement that state agents merely verify immigration status
by referring to INS information is much different from a requirement that state
agents actually make determinations as to who is, and who is not, deportable
under federal law. Permitting state agents, who are untrained -- and
unauthorized -- under federal law to make immigration status decisions, incurs
the risk that inconsistent and inaccurate judgments will be made. On the other
hand, requiring state agents simply to verify a person's status with the INS
involves no independent judgment on the part of state officials and ensures
uniform results consistent with federal determinations of immigration status.<p>
<p>
   The benefits denial provisions of Proposition 187 may therefore be
implemented without impermissibly regulating immigration if state agencies, in
verifying eligibility for services and benefits, rely on federal determinations
of status made by the INS and accessible through SAVE. Because state
regulations implementing Proposition 187 could require state agencies to verify
immigration status through reference to INS information and could deny state
actors discretion to apply non-federal criteria for benefits eligibility,
Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions are not an impermissible
regulation of immigration and therefore withstand scrutiny under the first De
Canas test.<p>
<p>
   Accordingly, the classification, notification and cooperation/reporting
provisions of the initiative, contained in sections 4 through 9 and in the
preamble, which are aimed solely at regulating immigration, are preempted. The
provisions which have the permissible purpose and effect of denying
state-funded benefits to persons who are unlawfully present in the United
States are not a regulation of immigration and therefore survive the first De
Canas test.<p>
<p>
   1. Section 4<p>
<p>
   Section 4, entitled "Law Enforcement Cooperation with the INS," requires law
enforcement agencies to verify the legal status of every arrestee who is
"suspected of being present in the United States in violation of federal
immigration laws" by "questioning the person" and "demanding documentation." @
4(b)(1). Section 4 requires law enforcement agencies to "notify the person of
his or her apparent status as an alien who is present in the United States in
violation of federal immigration laws and inform him or her that . . . he or
she must either obtain legal status or leave the United States. @ 4(b)(2). In
addition, section 4 requires the agency to "notify the Attorney General . . .
and the [INS] of the apparent illegal status." @ 4(b)(3). Finally, section 4
requires law enforcement agencies to "fully cooperate with the [INS] regarding
any person who is arrested if he or she is suspected" of being in the United
States illegally and prohibits any local governmental agency from limiting such
cooperation in any way. @ 4(a), (c).<p>
<p>
   Under the first De Canas test, a state may not require its agents to (i)
make independent determinations of who is and who is not in this country in
violation of immigration laws;" (ii) report such determinations to state and
federal authorities; or (iii) "cooperate" with the INS, solely for the purpose
of ensuring that such persons leave the country. The sole stated purpose and
the sole effect of section 4 is to impermissibly regulate immigration.
Accordingly, section 4 is entirely preempted by federal law under the first De
Canas test. <p>
<p>
   2. Sections 5 and 6<p>
<p>
   Section 5, entitled "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens from Public Social
Services," and section 6, entitled, "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens from Publicly
Funded Health Care," differ from section 4 in that their stated purpose and
effect is not solely to ensure the ouster of persons suspected of  being in
this country unlawfully. Rather, they have the additional purpose and effect of
excluding persons from obtaining public social and health care services. To the
extent that state actors deny benefits to persons based on determinations by
federal authorities that those individuals are deportable pursuant to federal
law, benefits denial is not a direct regulation of immigration, but rather, has
only the possible indirect effect of deterring "illegal" aliens from coming to
California or causing them to leave.<p>
<p>
   Sections 5 and 6 do not merely deny benefits, however. Both sections contain
classification, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions which are
roughly parallel those contained in section 4. See @@ 5(b), (c)(1), (c)(2);
6(b), (c)(1), (c)(2). These provisions are entirely unnecessary to the
implementation of the benefits denial provisions. That is, without those three
sets of provisions, both sections 5 and 6 still require public entities and
publicly-funded health care facilities to deny benefits to persons who are
determined to be in the United States in violation of federal law. See @@
5(c)(1), 6(c)(1). n10 <p>

<p>
   n10 As explained above, the benefits denial provisions in subsection (c) of
sections 5 and 6 may be constitutionally implemented only through a regulation
whereby state agents do not themselves determine a whether a person is lawfully
present in the United States and only verify a person's immigration status for
benefits denial purposes by relying on determinations made by the INS and
accessible through SAVE.<p>

<p>
   The classification, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions in
sections 5 and 6 add nothing to the statute except that they expand Proposition
187's impermissible scheme of immigration regulation -- by requiring agents of
the state (i) to make independent determinations of who is and who is not
"lawfully admitted" in this country, based on state-created criteria
(subsection (b)); and (ii) to report such determinations to state and federal
authorities solely for the purpose of ensuring that such persons leave the
country (subsections (c)(1) and (c)(2)).<p>
<p>
   In addition, subsection (b) is an impermissible immigration regulation
because, unlike the statute at issue in De Canas, the classification of persons
as (1) citizens; (2) lawfully admitted as a permanent resident or (3) lawfully
admitted for a temporary period is not in any way tied to federal standards.
Thus, the state has created its own scheme setting forth who is, and who is
      not, entitled to be in the United States. As discussed below, the INS's
standards for who is and who is not deportable are entirely different from
those set forth in subsection (b). See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. @ 1251(a). As the
Supreme  Court held in De Canas, a state cannot, on its own, determine who is
or is not entitled to be present in the United States. See De Canas, 424 U.S.
at 355.<p>
<p>
   Defendants contend that the Court should construe the term "lawfully
admitted" in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) as applying "to persons who are
present in the United States unlawfully, not to those who entered unlawfully."
They argue that such a construction avoids preemption, because "lawfully
present" is an immigration status standard applied under the INA, and thus the
classification of persons required under subsection (b) of sections 5 and 6
would be tied to federal standards, rather than to state-created criteria. This
argument is not persuasive. As plaintiffs point out, the term "lawfully
admitted" has its own established meaning under the INA. See  8 U.S.C. @ 1182.
n11 Thus, there is no basis for the Court to replace the word "admitted," with
the word "present." Moreover, even if the Court were to do so, the statute
still would not be tied to federal standards.<p>
<p>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

n11 Those lawfully "admitted" under federal immigration law are those who an
immigration officer determines to satisfy admissibility criteria at the time of
entry. 8 U.S.C. @ 1182. Thus, it is likely that there are aliens who are
lawfully present in the United States, but who were never lawfully "admitted"
as federal law defines that term. These include, for example, persons who
entered illegally but then were granted asylum under 8 U.S.C. @ 1158.
Conversely, some aliens who were lawfully "admitted" under the INA, but have
overstayed their visas, may no longer be lawfully present. The plain language
of subsection (b)(3) would include these aliens while the construction urged by
defendants would exclude them.<p>
<p>

-<p>
<p>
   The impermissible classification, notification, and cooperation/reporting
requirements of sections 5 and 6, subsections (b), (c)(2), and (c)(3), are
therefore preempted.<p>
<p>
   In the absence of the scheme created by those sections, the remaining
substantive provisions of sections 5 and 6 are contained in subsections 5(c)(1)
and 6(c)(1). Those provisions, standing alone, require that state agents deny
benefits to persons who are determined or suspected to be "in the United
States in violation of federal law. Defendants contend that (c)(1) is not an
immigration regulation because, absent the classification, notification, and
reporting provisions, (c)(1)'s effect is solely to deny benefits -- not to
determine who should or should not be permitted to remain in the United
States.<p>
<p>
   Indeed, in the absence of subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3), subsection
(c)'s verification component is utilized solely for the purpose of denying
benefits. Unlike subsection (b), subsection (c)(1)'s verification component is
tied to federal immigration standards, so that under subsection (c)(1),
benefits are denied based on an individual's federally-determined immigration
status and not on any independent criteria developed by the state.<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs counter that (c)(1) is not tied to any federal or state
immigration standards and is therefore preempted because, on its face,
subsection (c)(1) would deny benefits not only to aliens who are deportable
under federal immigration law but also to aliens who have, for example, failed
to file their tax returns, because technically such persons would be "alien[s]
in the United States in violation of federal law." This is a tortured reading
of the provision. The Court is obliged to uphold subsection (c)(1) if there is
any construction of the provision which is constitutional. Clearly (c)(1) can,
and should, be understood to require denial of benefits solely to deportable
aliens (i.e., those aliens whose presence in the United States is in violation
of federal immigration law). The Court must conclude that subsection (c)(1)
denies benefits based on federal determinations of immigration status and is
not an impermissible regulation of immigration. Such benefits denial is not
preempted under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   One additional problem remains. Subsection (c)(1) requires state agents to
deny benefits to any individual who is "determined or "reasonably suspected" to
be present in the United States in violation of federal law. Thus, on its face,
(c)(1) requires state actors to make independent determinations as to whether a
person is deportable under federal law. As discussed above, under the first De
Canas test, state actors may not make independent determinations as to persons'
immigration status. Only the INS can make such determinations, and so (c)(1)
may survive only if benefits are denied only to those persons determined to be
deportable by the INS. This problem is not irremediable, however. If the words
"or reasonably suspects, based on the information provided to it," are severed
from the subsection (c), sections 5 and 6 no longer would deny benefits to
persons who are merely suspected by a state agent, rather than determined by
the INS, to be deportable. And those words indeed are grammatically,
functionally, and volitionally severable. The language "or reasonably suspects,
based on the information provided to it," is grammatically severable, since
when it is omitted, the remaining language makes sense. The offending language
is also functionally severable, because denial of benefits  can be implemented
in its absence.  That is, a person can be denied benefits if the administrating
agent "determines," rather than merely "reasonably suspects . . ." that the
person is present in the country in violation of federal laws. Finally, the
"reasonably suspects" language is volitionally severable because the
severability clause evidences the intent of the electorate to permit the
severance of offending portions, and because it cannot be argued that the
language was crucial to the passage of the initiative.     Even in the absence
of the "reasonably suspects" language, however, it is still possible that under
subsection (c)(1) state actors could be required to deny benefits based on
their own independent determinations as to persons' immigration status. To
avoid this result, the state could implement a regulation requiring officials
to verify eligibility for services and benefits by accessing INS determinations
of individuals' immigration status through the SAVE system. If the "reasonably
suspects" language is omitted, and a regulation implementing the benefits
denial provisions required state agencies to utilize INS determinations in
denying benefits, subsection (c)(1) would not impermissibly regulate
immigration.  It would then withstand scrutiny under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   The question remains whether the invalid provisions of sections 5 and 6 are
severable from the remainder of the initiative. Plaintiffs contend that
subsections (b), (c)(2) and (3) are not functionally severable from the
remaining provisions in sections 5 and 6 and that a finding that subsections
(b), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are preempted requires a finding that all of sections 5
and 6 are preempted. However, as set forth above, subsection (c)(1) can operate
independently as a benefits denial provision absent the impermissible
immigration regulation scheme. Therefore, subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3)
are functionally severable from the initiative. Because it is reasonable to
conclude that the electorate would have preferred the implementation of the
benefits denial provisions rather than the invalidation of the entire
initiative had they foreseen the invalidity of the classification, notification
and cooperation/reporting provisions, subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are
volitionally severable. Finally, subsection (c)(1) makes grammatical sense
absent the severed provisions. Accordingly, subsections (b), (c)(2) and (c)(3)
are severable.<p>
<p>
   3. Section 7<p>
<p>
   Section 7 is entitled "Exclusion of Illegal Aliens From Public Elementary
and Secondary Schools." Like sections 5 and 6, section 7 contains
classification, notification and cooperation/reporting requirements that, taken
together, serve only to further the scheme to regulate immigration and are
unnecessary to the denial of public education.<p>
     In section 7, subsections (a) through (c) require schools to verify the
immigration status of children for the purposes of denying access to public
elementary and secondary education. Subsection (d) requires verification of the
immigration status of parents of school children. Subsection (e) requires
school districts to report the "illegal" status of any parent, guardian,
enrollee or pupil to state agencies and the INS. Subsection (f) requires school
districts to "fully cooperate" in "accomplishing an orderly transition to a
school in the child's country of origin."<p>
<p>
   Subsections (a), (b) and (c), together, assure that undocumented children
will be denied access to public education. Subsection (d) is wholly unnecessary
to implementing the denial of education mandated by section 7, because the
state has no  need to know the immigration status of parents in order to deny
benefits to children. Like subsection (b) in sections 5 and 6, the only purpose
and effect of subsections (d), (e), and (f) is to ensure that persons
determined by the state to be in the United States unlawfully are
"transitioned" to the "country of their origin." Subsections (d), (e) and (f)
are part of an impermissible scheme to regulate immigration and are therefore
preempted under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   In any event, an analysis of section 7 under the rigors of the first De
Canas test is not necessary to sustain the Court's ruling on these motions. In
light  of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S.
202, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 102 S. Ct. 2382 (1982), in which the Court held that the
Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits states from
excluding undocumented alien children from public schools, section 7 in its
entirety conflicts with and is therefore preempted by federal law.<p>
<p>
   4. Section 8<p>
<p>
   Subsection (a) of Section 8 prohibits public postsecondary educational
institutions from providing education to persons who are not "authorized under
federal law" to be in the United States. Subsection (b) requires such
institutions to verify the immigration status of each person enrolled or
attending to ensure that education is provided only to persons who are
"authorized under federal law" to be in the United States. Subsection (c)
requires admissions officers to report any persons who are "determined to be,
or . . . under reasonable suspicion of being in the United States in violation
of federal immigration laws" to state and federal authorities.<p>
<p>
   Subsection 8(c), like the reporting requirements in sections 5 and 6, cannot
survive because it has no purpose other than to regulate immigration. On the
other hand, subsections (a) and (b), like the denial of benefits in sections 5
and 6, are not regulations of immigration since they do not amount to
determinations of who may and may not remain in this country. In the absence of
subsection (c)'s reporting requirements, the verification components of
subsections (a) and (b) are permissible because their only purpose is to
determine who may and who may not receive postsecondary education. Also, the
verification components of subsections (a) and (b) are tied to federal
standards rather than to an impermissible state classification scheme. Because
subsections (a) and (b) may be implemented by requiring state actors to rely on
federal determinations rather than their own independent determinations of
immigration status to deny public postsecondary education, subsections (a) and
(b) are not preempted under the first De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   The final question is whether subsection (c) is functionally, volitionally
and grammatically severable from the remaining provisions of section 8. Since
the absence of the impermissible reporting requirements does not impair the
state's ability to deny public postsecondary education, subsection (c) is
functionally severable. Subsection (c) is grammatically severable because the
removal of subsection (c) does not render the remaining provisions of section 8
unintelligible. Finally, because it is reasonable to conclude that the
electorate would have preferred the implementation of the remaining provisions
rather than the invalidation of the entire section had they foreseen the
invalidity of the cooperation/reporting provision, subsection (c) is
volitionally severable.<p>
<p>
   5. Section 9<p>
<p>
   Section 9, entitled, "Attorney General cooperation with the INS," requires
the state attorney general to maintain records of, and to transmit to the INS,
all reports received from state agencies pertaining to persons who are
"suspected of being present in the United States in violation of federal
immigration laws." This section is preempted under the first De Canas test
because it has no purpose or effect except to further Proposition 187's
impermissible immigration regulation scheme.<p>
<p>
   Section 9 is a separate and distinct section of Proposition 187, the
severance of which does not impair the meaning of any remaining sections. It
is, therefore, grammatically severable from the remainder of the initiative.
Section 9 is functionally severable because it merely imposes additional
reporting and record-keeping requirements beyond those required by the other
sections of the initiative and eliminating these additional requirements does
not impair the operation of the remaining sections. Finally, because the
initiative's remaining benefits denial and criminal penalty provisions serve a
substantial purpose of the electorate and would have been approved even absent
the invalid provisions, section 9 is volitionally severable. n12<p>

conclusion:<p>
<p>
Therefore, the People of California declare their intention to provide for
cooperation between their agencies of state and local government with the
federal government, and to establish a system of required notification by and
between such agencies to prevent illegal aliens in the United States from
receiving benefits or public services in the State of California.<p>
<p>
(emphasis added). Since Proposition 187's cooperation/reporting requirements
are preempted, the underlined portion of the preamble states an impermissible
purpose. However, because the preamble has no practical effect absent the
invalid substantive provisions, it is not subject to the preemption inquiry.<p>

   6. Sections 2 and 3<p>
<p>
   Sections 2 and 3 criminalize making and using false documents "to conceal"
the "true citizenship or resident alien status" of a person. These provisions,
though they may indirectly affect immigration in some way, n13 can hardly be
said to be a "determination of who should or should not be admitted in to the
country." Like the benefit denial provisions, the criminal penalties,
criminalizing conduct that is dishonest and deceptive, are a legitimate
exercise of the police power of the state.<p>

   Plaintiffs contend that criminal penalties are part of the overall
immigration regulation scheme. Absent the verification, notification and
cooperation/reporting elements of the initiative, however, the criminal
penalties do not serve the impermissible goal of ensuring that "illegal" aliens
leave the country. Accordingly, sections 2 and 3 are not preempted under the
first De Canas test.<p>
 <p>
   B. Whether Proposition 187 Is Preempted Because Congress Intended to Occupy
the Field.<p>
<p>
   Under the second De Canas test, even if a statute is not an impermissible
regulation of immigration, it may still be preempted if there is a showing that
Congress intended to "occupy the field" which the statute attempts to regulate.
De Canas, 424 U.S. at 357.<p>
<p>
   As discussed above, the Constitution commits the power to regulate
immigration exclusively to the federal government. De Canas, 424 U.S. at 354,
356. Congress has fully occupied the field of immigration regulation through
enactment and implementation of the INA. See, e.g., Gonzales v. City of Peoria,
722 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1983) ("We assume that the civil provisions of the [INA]
regulating authorized entry, length of stay, residence status, and deportation,
constitute such a pervasive regulatory scheme, as would be consistent with the
exclusive federal power over immigration."). Since the classification,
notification and cooperation/reporting requirements contained in sections 1 and
4 through 9 constitute  a scheme to regulate immigration, those provisions are
necessarily preempted under the second De Canas test as well.<p>
 <p>
   Because the Court has determined that the benefits denial and criminal
provisions in sections 2 and 3 are not impermissible regulations of
immigration, the question remains whether these provisions are nevertheless
preempted because Congress has intended to occupy the field on which they
touch. Under the second De Canas test, the benefits denial provisions of
sections 5 through 8 are preempted only if they regulate a field in which
Congress intended a "complete ouster" of state power, even if a state
regulation in that field is not in conflict with federal law. See  De Canas,
424 U.S. at 356, 357. In De Canas, the Supreme Court defined the field on which
the statute in question touched not as the broad field of immigration
regulation, but, rather, the more narrow field of employment of illegal aliens.
Id. Finding nothing in the INA which indicated Congressional intent to preclude
state regulation touching on the employment of illegal aliens, the Court
refused to "presume that Congress . . . intended to oust state authority to
regulate the employment  relationship covered by the [statute]," and held that
the statute was not preempted. Id. at 357.<p>
<p>
   Similarly, the field on which Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions
touch is not the broad field of immigration regulation but, rather, the public
benefits field, specifically alien eligibility for public benefits. Since
nothing in the wording or legislative history of the INA "unmistakably
confirms" an intent to oust state authority to regulate in the public benefits
field, and because, as in De Canas, such an intent cannot be "derived from the
scope and detail of the INA . . . governing entry and stay of aliens," id. at
359, Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions are not preempted under the
second De Canas test. n14<p>
<p>
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Footnotes- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

<p>
   n14 The Court in De Canas also recognized that because certain federal
legislation pertaining to farm labor contractor registration explicitly
contemplated supplementary and consistent "appropriate State law and
regulation," 7 U.S.C. @ 2051, the INA could "not be taken as legislation by
Congress expressing its judgment to have uniform federal regulations in matters
affecting employment of illegal aliens, and therefore barring state
legislation" such as the statute at issue.  De Canas, 424 U.S. at 361-62.
Likewise in this case, the public benefits scheme in this country is
predominantly a cooperative federal-state effort based on voluntary state
participation in federally-funded public benefits programs such as AFDC,
Medicaid and Food Stamps and the states' optional provision of state funded
public benefits not within the federal scheme. Thus, it cannot be said that the
INA was unmistakably intended to preclude states from regulating, to the extent
consistent with federal law, the provision of public benefits and services.<p>

<p>
   Likewise, the criminal provisions set forth in sections 2 and 3 are not
preempted under the second De Canas test. Plaintiffs have made no showing
whatsoever that Congress intended to effect a "complete ouster of state power
-- including state power to promulgate laws not in conflict with federal laws"
with respect to criminalizing the falsification and use of forged
identification documents. 424 U.S. at 357. The field on which sections 2 and 3
touch is not the broad field of immigration regulation but, rather, the field
of the criminal law as it relates to false documents. Since nothing in the
legislative history of the INA, or in the INA itself, reveals an intent to oust
state authority to criminalize the production or use of false identification,
sections 2 and 3 are not preempted under the second De Canas test.<p>
<p>
   C. Whether Proposition 187 Is Preempted Because It Directly Conflicts With
Federal Law<p>
<p>
   The final inquiry under De Canas is whether, "although the INA contemplates
some room for state legislation," De Canas, 424 U.S. at 363, Proposition 187 is
preempted in whole or in part because it "stands as an obstacle to the
accomplishment and execution of  the full purposes and objectives of
Congress." Id. (citing  Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 67, 85 L. Ed. 581, 61
S. Ct. 399 (1941)). Stated differently, the provisions of Proposition 187 may
be preempted because they conflict with federal law making compliance with both
state and federal law impossible. Michigan Canners &amp; Freezers, 467 U.S. at
469.<p>
<p>
   1. Classification, Notification, and Reporting Provisions<p>
<p>
   As set forth above, Proposition 187's classification, notification and
cooperation/reporting provisions are preempted under the first and second De
Canas tests because taken together, they constitute an impermissible scheme for
the regulation of immigration. Those same provisions also violate the third De
Canas test, because they are in conflict with federal laws governing the
deportation of aliens.<p>
<p>
   The INA specifies an exclusive list of grounds for deportation, 8 U.S.C.
1251(a), and provides that that procedure shall be the "sole and exclusive
procedure for determining the deportability of an alien." 8 U.S.C. @ 1252(b)
(emphasis added). The procedure requires, among other things, that only a
"special inquiry officer" (an immigration judge) may conduct deportation
proceedings. Id. The INA's accompanying regulations require "every proceeding
to determine the deportability of an alien in the United   States [to be]
commenced by the filing of an order to show cause with the Office of the
Immigration Judge." 8 C.F.R. @ 242.1(a); 8 U.S.C. 1252a. The authority to issue
such orders is delegated to a discrete list of federal officers. Id. Only
specified federal officials can commence deportation proceedings, and only an
immigration judge in deportation proceedings can determine that an alien is
deportable and order the alien to leave the United States. Id.; 8 U.S.C. @@
1252(a), 1252(b). Then, after a "final order" of deportation issues, only the
Attorney General may "effect the alien's departure from the United States." 8
U.S.C. @ 1252(c).<p>
<p>
   Proposition 187's classification, notification and cooperation/reporting
provisions directly contradict the INA's mandate that the procedure outlined in
the INA "shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining the
deportability of an alien." These provisions create a new, wholly independent
procedure, pursuant to which state law enforcement, welfare, health care, and
education  officials--rather than federal officials and immigration judges--are
required to determine the deportability of aliens and effect their deportation.
The classification, notification and cooperation/ reporting provisions delegate
to state agents tasks which federal law delegates exclusively to federal
agents. These provisions are in direct conflict with and are preempted by
federal law.<p>
 <p>
   2. Denial of Benefits Provisions<p>
<p>
   a. Conflicts based on classification and remaining verification provisions
 Proposition 187 requires, for the implementation of its benefits denial
provisions, that public social service agencies, public health care facility
personnel, public school districts and postsecondary educational institutions
classify or verify the immigration status of applicants for benefits and
services.<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs argue that because the classification provisions define legal
immigration status more narrowly than federal law, and because the remaining
verification provisions require state agents to classify persons' immigration
status based on "suspicion," those provisions will result in the denial of
benefits to persons who fail to meet state criteria but are nevertheless
lawfully present in the United States under federal law. The plaintiffs contend
that both types of verification provisions are preempted under the third De
Canas test.<p>
<p>
   Defendants argue that the initiative "does not set up a classification
system" at all and that the classification provisions, like the remaining
verification provisions which are tied to federal standards, should be
construed as applying only to persons who are present in the United States in
violation of federal immigration laws.<p>
<p>
   (1) The classification provisions<p>
<p>
   As discussed above, Proposition 187 establishes three state-created
categories of lawful immigration status on which the denial of benefits is
based. These categories define persons as "legal" and entitled to receive
benefits if they are citizens of the United States, aliens lawfully admitted as
permanent residents and aliens lawfully admitted for a temporary period of
time. See @@ 5(b)(1)-(3), 6(b)(1)-(3), 7(d)(1)-(3). These three categories,
however, fail to recognize several federal categories of persons who are not
citizens, not admitted as permanent residents and not admitted for a temporary
period of time but who are nevertheless present in  the United States,
authorized to remain here and eligible for certain benefits in accordance with
federal law. For example, federal law authorizes certain refugees, n15 asylees,
n16 persons granted withholding of deportation, n17 parolees, n18 persons
protected by "family unity" status, n19 persons present under temporary
protected status, n20 persons granted deferred enforced departure ("DED"), n21
persons eligible for suspension or stay of deportation n22 and battered
immigrant women and children n23 to remain in the United States permanently,
indefinitely or temporarily. None of these categories of lawful immigration
status is accounted for by  Proposition 187's classification scheme.<p>

   Sections 5, 6 and 7 utilize this underinclusive classification scheme to
deny benefits and services to persons who fail to meet state criteria for
lawful immigration status but are lawfully present in the United States and
entitled to receive benefits and services under federal law. Congress has
conditioned eligibility for some federal-state cooperative benefits programs
covered by sections 5 and 6 on lawful immigration status under federal
immigration laws. For example, eligibility for the Medicaid, Aid to Families
with Dependent Children ("AFDC") and Food Stamps programs depends on
verification of immigration status through the SAVE system. In administering
these programs, state agencies verify recipient immigration status by accessing
INS information. Since some persons otherwise eligible for benefits under
federal standards would be excluded by Proposition 187's underinclusive
classification scheme, denying services based on the classification scheme
conflicts with the existing federal eligibility system for programs
administered under SAVE. This classification scheme, preempted under the first
and second De Canas tests, is also preempted under the third De Canas test as
used to deny social and health services under sections 5 and 6 and education
under section 7.<p>
<p>
   The question remains whether the impermissible classification scheme in
subsection (b) of sections 5 and 6 and subsection (d) of section 7 is severable
from the remainder of the initiative. The subsections are grammatically
severable because their absence does not render the remaining subsections
unintelligible. The subsections are functionally severable because the benefits
denial provisions may be implemented by utilizing the remaining verification
provisions in subsection (c) of sections 5 and 6 and subsections (b) and (c) of
section 7 which bases denial of benefits and services on federal immigration
standards. Finally, the subsections  are volitionally severable because it
cannot be said that voter approval of the initiative was dependent on any
particular classification scheme as long as the effect was the denial of
benefits and services to illegal aliens. Thus, subsection (b) of section 5 and
6 and subsection (d) of section 7 are preempted by federal law but may be
severed from the remainder of the initiative.<p>
<p>
   (2) The remaining verification provisions<p>
<p>
   Subsection (c) of sections 5 and 6 provides that if any public entity
"determines or reasonably suspects, based on the information provided to it,"
that an applicant for benefits or services is an "alien in the United States in
violation of federal law," the entity shall deny the benefits or services. @@
5(c), 6(c). Subsection (b) of sections 7 and 8 likewise calls for verification
of status based on federal immigration standards by requiring school districts
and postsecondary educational institutions to verify that students and/or
parents are "authorized under federal law to be present in the United States."
@@ 7(b), 8(b). Because these provisions require verification by reference to
federal immigration standards, conflict with that law is not readily apparent.
Because Congress conditions eligibility for benefits under the AFDC, Food
Stamps and Medicaid programs on lawful immigration status and requires state
agents to verify applicant eligibility by accessing INS information through the
SAVE system, section 5's denial of benefits to persons "in the United States in
violation of federal law" does not conflict with or impede the objectives of
federal law. Section 5 is not preempted to the extent that it applies to
federally funded programs for which Congress has conditioned benefit
eligibility on lawful immigration status.<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs contend, however, that the verification procedure required by
subsection (c) of sections 5 and 6, based on the reasonable suspicion of state
agents, cannot be constitutionally implemented because denying benefits to
those merely suspected of being present in violation of federal laws conflicts
with federal law which entitles those lawfully present in the United States to
the receipt of certain benefits. In other words, because benefits may be denied
under Proposition 187 to individuals who are in fact lawfully present in the
United States if the administering agent merely reasonably suspects they are
      present  in violation of federal law, the verification procedure
conflicts with and impedes the objective of federal law with respect to
immigrant benefit eligibility.<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs are correct. Because the only constitutional implementation of
Proposition 187's benefits denial provisions would require state agents to
utilize federal determinations of immigration status, and because a state
agent's "reasonable suspicion" of unlawful immigrant status is not the same as
a federal determination of immigration status, the "reasonably suspects"
language conflicts with federal law. It is therefore preempted under the third
De Canas test. The "reasonably suspects" language in subsection (c) may be
severed from the remainder of subsection (c).<p>
<p>
   The remaining verification provisions in sections 7 and 8 pertaining to the
denial of public education do not suffer from the same defect as their
counterparts in sections 5 and 6 because public school authorities are merely
required to verify a student's immigration status as lawful under federal law.
No "reasonable suspicions" are involved. Because verification of immigration
status by reference to INS information is permissible through programs such as
SAVE, the remaining verification provisions of sections 7 n24 and 8 are not in
conflict with federal law and are not preempted under the third De Canas test.

   b. Conflicts based on benefits denial provisions<p>
<p>
   As applied to federally-funded programs and federally-funded health care
facilities, the benefits denial provisions of sections 5 and 6, even if
implemented to deny benefits and services only to persons present in the United
States in violation of federal immigration laws, appear to conflict with
various federal laws. It is unclear, however, from the showing made here
whether, under  Ray v. Atlantic Richfield Co., 435 U.S. 151, 158-160, 55 L. Ed.
2d 179, 98 S. Ct. 988 (1978), these apparent conflicts render the denial of
benefits provisions completely preempted or preempted only to the extent that
they apply to federally-funded benefits. Moreover, even if the Court were to
hold that the apparent conflicts with federal laws do not completely defeat the
denial of benefits provisions, the defendants have made only a general
representation to the Court that there are purely state-funded benefits and
services to which the initiative could apply. Because the implications of Ray
are unclear and because the Court is not convinced that there actually are any
such wholly state-funded benefits programs and health care facilities, the
Court declines to rule on whether the denial of benefits provisions are
preempted. Nevertheless the Court sees several apparent conflicts between the
operation of the benefits denial provisions and various federal laws.<p>
<p>
   (1) Section 5<p>
<p>
   The remaining benefits denial provision of section 5 provides that "any
public entity" shall not provide benefits or services to persons determined to
be "alien[s] in the United States in violation of federal law." @ 5(c)(1). By
its plain language, section 5 applies to "any public entity" in the state of
California and covers "public social services" or "benefits and
services"administered by those entities. Id. "Public social services" is
broadly defined under California law to include:  those activities and
functions of state and local government administered or supervised by the
department [of Social Services] or the State Department of Health Services and
involved in providing aid or services or both . . . to  those people of the
state who, because of their economic circumstances or social condition, are in
need thereof and may benefit thereby.<p>
<p>
Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code @ 10051. The Court concludes that section 5 broadly
denies any and all aid, services and programs administered or supervised by the
state departments of social and health services to persons without lawful
immigration status under federal law. Accordingly, to the extent that section 5
would deny public social services to persons entitled to receive them under
federal law, section 5 conflicts with federal law. Plaintiffs argue that
section 5's denial of public social services conflicts with federal law
regardless of whether eligibility is based on the impermissible underinclusive
classification scheme in subsection (b), or on federal immigration standards
referenced in subsection (c), because Proposition 187 conditions eligibility
for some federal-state cooperative programs on lawful immigration status where
the federal legislation authorizing such programs imposes no such requirements.
Specifically, plaintiffs contend that there is a conflict between section 5 and
the Women, Infants, and Children program n25 and child welfare services n26
because benefits are available under these federally-funded programs regardless
of immigration status.<p>

&amp; Inst. Code @ 15500 et seq. The federal statutes governing the program do
not  condition eligibility on lawful immigration status. See  42 U.S.C. @ 1786.
Defendants concede, as they must, that if the Women, Infants and Children
program is a "public social service" within the meaning of section 5,
conditioning eligibility for benefits under the program on lawful immigration
status conflicts with the federal law which makes those benefits available
regardless of immigration status. Given California's broad definition of
"public social service," section 5's denial of public social services clearly
applies to the Women, Infants and Children program. Therefore, section 5's
denial of social services as applied to the program conflicts with federal
law.<p>
<p>
   Qualified child welfare services programs administered by states receive
grants of federal funding under various federal laws. n27 Defendants do not
dispute that section 5 conflicts with these laws if construed to apply to
federally-funded child welfare programs for which federal law does not
condition eligibility on immigration status. Rather, defendants argue that
child welfare services are entirely outside the scope of section 5 as a matter
of statutory construction. Defendants contend that subsection 5(c)(1) applies
only to public social service programs to which persons voluntarily and
affirmatively apply. They argue that because child welfare services are
generally extended to children who are involuntarily placed in the protective
custody of the state and are not benefits for which a person voluntarily
applies, section 5 is inapplicable to child welfare services. This distinction
is specious. Section  5 applies broadly to deny "public social services" and
"benefits and services" to persons present in the United States in violation of
federal law. @ 5(c)(1). Child welfare services fall squarely within
California's definition of public social services. See Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst.
Code @ 16500.<p>
<p>
   Moreover, some children do affirmatively seek state intervention (either<p>
personally or through a representative). Thus, defendants' construction of<p>
section 5 would deny benefits to children who actively seek placement with
child<p>
welfare services, while granting the same services to children who wait<p>
for the state to intervene. Because this absurd result could not have been<p>
contemplated by the voters and because child welfare services fall squarely<p>
within California's definition of public social services, child welfare
services<p>
are not excluded from section 5's coverage.<p>

   Finally, section 5 may serve to deny state-administered public social
services that are not part of any federal-state cooperative program and do not
receive any federal funding. As noted above, the Court is unable to conclude
that such wholly state-funded programs in fact exist. n29 If such programs do
exist, it does not appear that section 5's denial of wholly state-funded
benefits would conflict with and be preempted by federal law. That the state's
denial of such benefits may be unconstitutional on other grounds is not a
question before the Court at this time.<p>

   In sum, section 5's benefits denial provisions conflict with federal law as
applied to public social services funded in any part by the federal government
and made available to persons under the authorizing federal statutes regardless
of immigration status. Section 5, to the extent that it denies benefits under
wholly state-funded programs and under federal-state cooperative programs such
as Medicaid, Food Stamps and AFDC, eligibility for which Congress has already
conditioned on lawful immigration status, does not appear to conflict with
federal law. The Court makes no determination, however, as to whether section
5's benefits denial provision is wholly preempted. A further showing would be
required to reach this conclusion.<p>

   (2) Section 6<p>
<p>
   The remaining benefits denial provision of section 6 requires "any publicly
funded health care facility" in California to deny services "other than
emergency medical care as required by federal law" to persons determined to be
"alien[s] in the United States in violation of federal law." @@ 6(c),

care facilities which receive any federal funding, conflicts with and is
preempted by federal laws, specifically the Hill-Burton Act, n30 the Public
Health Services Act ("PHSA"), n31 and the Emergency Medical Treatment and
Active Labor Act ("EMTALA"), n32 which require the provision of emergency and
other health care services regardless of immigration status.<p>

   Defendants respond that because the goal of section 6 is to prevent the use
of public funds to provide health care services to persons not lawfully in the
country, Hill-Burton and PHSA facilities are not prevented from providing all
services to unlawful immigrants but, rather, are merely denied public
reimbursement for the services so provided. Further, defendants contend that
emergency medical care required by EMTALA is explicitly excluded from the scope
of section 6.<p>
<p>
   (a) The Hill-Burton Act<p>
<p>
   The Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. @ 291 et seq., provides for allocation of
federal funds to states for the rehabilitation, construction or modernization
of public and nonprofit hospitals. See  42 U.S.C. @ 291c. In an application for
funds under the Act, the applicant state and institution must make assurances
that: <p>
<p>
(1) the facility or portion thereof to be constructed or modernized will be
made available to all persons residing in the territorial area of the
applicant; and (2) there will be made available in the facility or portion
thereof to be constructed or modernized a reasonable volume of services to
persons unable to pay therefor . . . . 42 U.S.C. @ 291c(e). The regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Act interpret the assurance that the facilities
will be made available to "all persons" to mean that services be provided  to
all persons residing . . . in the facility's service area, without
discrimination on the ground of race, color, national origin, creed or any
other ground unrelated to an individual's need for the service or the
availability of the needed service in the facility.<p>
<p>
42 C.F.R. @ 124.603(a)(1) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs argue that section 6
conflicts with federal law because it requires Hill-Burton facilities to deny
health services based on immigration status, a ground unrelated to the
individual's need or the availability of needed services. Plaintiffs contend
that section 6 must be read to prohibit the provision of all health services to
undocumented persons, even services to be self-paid by the patient or funded by
private charity, and therefore cannot be construed to avoid conflict with the
Hill-Burton Act.<p>
<p>
   Defendants argue that Hill-Burton facilities are not prohibited from
providing all services to undocumented persons but, rather, are merely
prohibited from providing publicly-funded services to such persons. In other
words, relying on language in the preamble of section 6 evidencing an intent to
deny "publicly-funded health care" to persons present in violation of federal
immigration laws, defendants argue that Hill-Burton facilities may provide
self-paid or charitable services to undocumented persons, and therefore no
conflict with federal law exists. See @ 6(a).<p>
<p>
   The plain language of subsection 6(c)(1) broadly prohibits "any
publicly-funded health care facility" n33 from providing "health care services"
or "services" other than emergency services required by federal law. @ 6(c)(1).
Despite the language in subsection 6(a) evidencing an intent to deny
undocumented  persons "the benefits of publicly-funded health care" and to
"protect public funds from misuse," subsection (c) contains no such limiting
language, and proscribes the provision of "services," generally, by
publicly-funded health care facilities to persons unlawfully present in the
United States. @@ 6(a), (c). Further, health care facilities do not, as a
practical matter, at the service provider level, make distinctions between
services that are "publicly-funded" and services that are funded by other
sources. It is difficult for the Court to conceive of a manner in which section
6 could operate under the construction urged by the defendants. The Court
thus<p>
<p>
declines to eschew the plain language of the statute in favor of defendant's<p>
interpretation. Section 6 must be construed to require publicly-funded health<p>
care facilities to deny all services other than emergency medical care
required<p>
by federal law. Because Hill-Burton facilities must make their services<p>
available to all persons without regard to immigration status, the operation
of<p>
section 6 conflicts with the requirements of the Hill-Burton Act.<p>

  n33 Subsection (d) of section 6 provides that the term "publicly-funded<p>
health care facility" is to be defined as specified in Sections 1200 and 1250
of<p>
the California Health and Safety Code. Section 1250 defines "health facility"<p>
as:<p>
<p>
any facility, place or building which is organized, maintained, and operated
for<p>
the diagnosis, care, prevention, and treatment of human illness, physical or<p>
mental, including convalescence and rehabilitation and including care during

persons, to which the persons are admitted for a 24-hour stay or longer.<p>
<p>
Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code @ 1250. Section 1200 defines "clinic" as
follows:an organized outpatient health facility which provides direct medical,
surgical,dental, optometric, or podiatric advice, services or treatment to
patients whoremain less than 24 hours, and which may also provide diagnostic or
therapeuticservices to patients in the home as an incident to care provided at
the clinicfacility.<p>
<p>
Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code @ 1200. While these sections define "health
carefacility," they fail to explain what is intended by the term
"publicly-funded."Under these broad definitions, section 6 must be construed to
apply to allhospitals that receive any "public" funding, state or federal.<p>

<p>
   Even if section 6's denial of health care services is construed to apply
onlyto publicly-funded services, denying "free" services based on immigration
statusnevertheless conflicts with the Hill-Burton Act's requirement that
eachrecipient facility provide a "reasonable volume of services to persons
unable topay therefor," 42 U.S.C. @ 291c(e)(2), without discrimination based
onany ground "unrelated to an individual's need for the service or
theavailability of the needed service in the facility . . ." 42 C.F.R.
@124.603(a)(1). This does not mean that a Hill-Burton facility is required
totreat any person, regardless of his or her ability to pay, who appears at
thedoors simply because the person resides in the facility's area.
Rather,Hill-Burton facilities are required to provide a "reasonable volume of
services"to persons unable to pay without discriminating between these persons
on anybasis unrelated to patient need or service availability. That is,
Hill-Burtonfacilities may not close the door on a person based merely on
immigrationstatus. Section 6's denial of health care services, to the extent it
applies toHill-Burton facilities, conflicts with federal law.<p>
<p>
   (b) Public Health Service Act<p>
<p>
   Under the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. @ 201 et seq., grantsof
federal funds are available to public and nonprofit private entities
forprojects to plan and develop "community health centers" to serve
medicallyunderserved populations. 42 U.S.C. @ 254c(c). The Public Health
ServicesAct defines "community health center" as an entity which, "through its
staff . .. or through cooperative arrangements with other public or private
entities"provides health and health-related information and referral services
toresidents of the area it serves (the "catchment area"). 42 U.S.C. @254c(a).
The Act provides for grants of federal funds to community healthcenters serving
areas designated as having a shortage of personal healthservices. 42 U.S.C. @@
254c(c); 254(b)(3). Any hospital or otherfacility receiving grants under this
section for the purpose of serving amedically underserved population is a
"community health facility" within themeaning of the Public Health Services
Act. Community health centers funded undersection 254c(c) must be administered
to ensure that services are made availableand accessible in a manner "assuring
continuity of service to theresidents of the center's catchment area." 42
C.F.R. @ 51c.303(a).<p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs argue that section 6, which prohibits community health centers
from providing any services to catchment area residents in the United States
unlawfully, conflicts with and is preempted by the Act which requires such
facilities to make services available to catchment area residents regardless
ofthose persons' immigration status. Defendants respond that facilities
deemed"community health centers" by virtue of their receipt of federal funding
under the Act are only prohibited from providing publicly-funded health
services andmay provide self-paid or privately-funded services to undocumented
persons.However, because section 6 requires all "publicly-funded health care
facilities"to deny "health care services" and "services" other than emergency
medical services, and does not by its language limit such denial to services
for which reimbursements with public money are made, section 6 conflicts with
the PublicHealth Service Act provisions pertaining to federally-funded
community healthcenters.<p>
<p>
   (c) Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act<p>
<p>
   EMTALA, 42 U.S.C. @ 1395dd, requires hospitals underMedicare provider
agreements with the federal government to provide "anappropriate medical
screening examination" to "any individual" requestingmedical treatment from
hospital emergency departments regardless of the person'sability to pay. 42
U.S.C. @ 1395dd(a). The screening must include allroutinely available ancillary
services, and, if the patient is found to have an"emergency condition," the
hospital is required to provide the care necessary tostabilize the patient's
condition. 42 U.S.C. @ 1395dd(b). The hospital may not delay in providing a
screening or treatment required to stabilize anemergency condition in order to
inquire about an individual's insurance orability to pay for services. 42
U.S.C. @ 1395dd(h). <p>
<p>
   Plaintiffs contend that section 6 conflicts with EMTALA because it
precludeshealth care facilities from providing the required screening to
persons whose conditions do not appear to require "emergency medical care," the
only services exempted from section 6. @@ 6(a), 6(c). n34 Defendants argue that
subsections (a) and (c), by creating an exception for "emergency medical care
as required by federal law," exempt all of EMTALA's screening, stabilization
and treatment requirements and therefore do not conflict with federal law. Id.
Because the clear intent of the enacting body was to exempt "emergency medical
care as required by federal law," and it is reasonable to interpret this
exemption to include all of EMTALA's screening, stabilization and treatment
requirements, the Court concludes that section 6's denial of health services
does not conflict with but, rather, is entirely consistent with, federal law
pertaining to emergency medical services.<p>

   In sum, section 6 must be construed to require all publicly-funded health
care facilities to deny all medical services, except emergency screening and
treatment procedures required by federal law, to persons not lawfully present
in the United States under federal law. To the extent that section 6 applies to
facilities that receive federal funding under programs such as the Hill-Burton
and Public Health Services Act and requires denial of non-emergency medical
services to persons unlawfully present where the federal legislation  enabling
the programs is silent with respect to the immigration status of medical care
recipients, section 6 conflicts with federal law. However, to the extent that
section 6 applies to wholly state-funded health care facilities, if in fact
such facilities exist n35, the denial of non-emergency health services to
persons unlawfully present in the United States does not appear to conflict
with any federal law. While recognizing these conflicts, the Court cannot
determine on the record before it whether section 6's denial of benefits
provision is entirely preempted or preempted only to the extent that it applies
to federal grant recipient health care facilities.<p>

   (3) Section 7<p>
<p>
   Section 7 denies public elementary and secondary education to (i) children
who are in the United States in violation of federal law, and (ii) children
who are citizens or otherwise legally present, but whose parents or guardians
are in the United States unlawfully. See @@ 7(a), 7(e), 7(f). This denial of
public education directly conflicts with federal law as announced in the
Supreme Court's decision in  Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 102
S. Ct. 2382 (1982). n36 In Plyler, the Supreme Court held that the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a state from denying
"to undocumented school-age children the free public education that it provides
to children who are citizens of the United States or legally admitted aliens."
Plyler, 457 U.S. at 205. The Supreme Court rejected each of the state's
proffered justifications for denying education to undocumented children,
including the desire "to protect itself from an influx of illegal immigrants,"
to "preserve . . . the state's limited resources for the education of its
lawful residents," and to remove the alleged "special burdens [undocumented
children] impose on the State's ability to provide high-quality public
education," as constitutionally insufficient to deny children access to a basic
education and noted the conflict that would result if the state were to deny
education to "a child enjoying an inchoate federal permission to remain." Id.
at 226-230. Clearly, then, section 7's denial of a public education based on
the immigration status of the child or the child's parent or guardian conflicts
with and is preempted by federal law as announced by the Supreme Court in
Plyler. n37<p>

<p>
   n36 Although plaintiffs did not assert Plyler as a basis for conflict
preemption of section 7 in their motions for summary judgment, the Court is
nevertheless constrained to consider the irreconcilable conflict between
section 7 and federal law as announced by the Supreme Court in that case. The
Ayala plaintiffs have also alleged that section 7 directly conflicts with the
Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. @ 1400 et seq. (the
"IDEA"), because the IDEA specifically guarantees a free appropriate public
education to all disabled children, regardless of immigration status. Since the
Court finds here that section 7 is preempted in its entirety as applied to all
children, this separate ground for summary judgment need not be considered.<p>
<p>
<p>
   n37 In finding the state's reasons for attempting to withhold public
education from undocumented children constitutionally "insubstantial," the
Supreme Court in Plyler was particularly concerned with the state statute
because it was directed at children, persons the Court deemed "special members"
of the "underclass" of undocumented aliens present in this country. Plyler, 457
U.S. at 219. Distinguishing undocumented children, who are capable of affecting
"'neither their parents' conduct nor their own status,'" from their adult
parents, who are willingly present in violation of federal immigration  laws,
the Court concluded that it is "difficult to conceive of a rational
justification for penalizing these children for their presence within the
United States." Id. at 219-220 (citing  Trimble v. Gordon, 430 U.S. 762, 770,
52 L. Ed. 2d 31, 97 S. Ct. 1459 (1977)). While "persuasive arguments support
the view that a State may withhold its beneficence from those whose very
presence within the United States is the product of their own unlawful
conduct," the "arguments do not apply with the same force to classifications
imposing disabilities on the minor children of such illegal entrants." Id.
Recognizing the costs the state statute imposed on "the innocent children who
[were] its victims, the Court concluded that the statute failed equal
protection scrutiny, despite the fact that classifications based on
undocumented alien status are not suspect and education is not a fundamental
right, because it failed to further "some substantial goal of the State." Id.
at 224. The Supreme Court's reasoning and ruling in Plyler appears to compel a
finding that section 6's denial of health care services, as applied to
undocumented children, is equally without "rational justification" and
offensive to the principles of equal protection. Id. at 220. Although the Court
declines at this time to rule on this extension of Plyler, it does note that
section 6, to the extent it denies health care services to undocumented
children, appears to be in direct conflict with federal law.<p>

Plaintiffs do not identify any provision of federal law that conflicts with

the INS statement permitting aliens "considered to be residing permanently in

false documents, a fine of up to $ 75,000 and for use of such documents, a fine

penalties than those already imposed under federal laws regulating the
production or use of false citizenship, naturalization and alien registration
papers and the misuse or forgery of passports and visas, n39 sections 2 and 3

penalties contemplated by sections 2 and 3 conflict with or impede the

IV. Conclusion<p>
<p>
     The California voters' overwhelming approval of Proposition 187 reflects
their justifiable frustration with the federal government's inability to
enforce the immigration laws effectively. No matter how serious the problem may
be, however, the authority to regulate immigration belongs exclusively to the
federal government and state agencies are not permitted to assume that
authority. The State is powerless to enact its own scheme to regulate
immigration or to devise immigration regulations which run parallel to or
purport to supplement the federal immigration laws.<p>
<p>
   The classification, notification and cooperation/reporting provisions in
sections 4 through 9 of the initiative, taken together, constitute a regulatory
scheme (1) to detect persons present in California in violation of
state-created categories of lawful immigration status; (2) to notify state and
federal officials of their purportedly unlawful status; and (3) to effect their
removal from the United States. These provisions create an impermissible state
scheme to regulate immigration and are preempted under the first and second De
Canas tests. Plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment are granted with respect
to these provisions.<p>
<p>
   The benefits denial provisions of the initiative -- if implemented by state
regulations which would require verification of immigration status by reference
to federal determinations of status -- have only an incidental  impact on
immigration and thus do not violate the first De Canas test. Nor do those
provisions violate the second De Canas test. Plaintiffs have failed to direct
the Court to any authority for the proposition that Congress intended to
completely oust state authority to legislate in the area of benefits denial.
Consequently, the Court must conclude that those provisions are preempted only
if their operation conflicts with or impedes the objectives of federal laws.<p>
<p>
   Section 7's denial of primary and secondary education conflicts with federal
law as announced by the Supreme Court in Plyler v. Doe and is therefore
preempted. Section 8's denial of postsecondary education does not appear to
conflict with any federal law and thus is not preempted. With respect to the
benefits denial provisions in sections 5 and 6, to the extent that they deny
federally-funded benefits and services, those provisions conflict with federal
laws authorizing such benefits and services without reference to immigration
status. It is unclear from the showing made whether the existence of such
conflicts render sections 5 and 6 wholly preempted or preempted only to the
extent that they conflict with federal law. Moreover, the Court may not need to
reach that issue, for while it appears that the state could permissibly deny
wholly state-funded benefits and services without impeding the objectives of
federal law, it is unclear from the record whether any such purely state-funded
programs or health care facilities in fact exist. The showing made on these
motions is inadequate to permit the Court to resolve the issue of whether the
provisions are wholly preempted or whether they are preempted only to a limited
extent. For these reasons, plaintiffs' motions with respect to the denial of
benefits provisions in sections 5 and 6 are denied.<p>
<p>
   Finally, for the reasons set forth above, sections 2 and 3 are not
preempted. Plaintiffs' motions with respect to those sections are denied.<p>

cooperation between their agencies of state and local government with the
federal government, and to establish a system of required notification by and
between such agencies to prevent illegal aliens in the United States from
receiving benefits or public services in the State of California.<p>
