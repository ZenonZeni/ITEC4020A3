<h2>World Energy Engineering Congress Scheduled for November</h2>

The 19th World Energy Engineering Congress (WEEC), presented by
the Association of Energy Engineers and sponsored in part by DOE's
Federal Energy Management Program, is joined this year by companion
programs as part of "Operational Efficiency Week." The
Energy Service & Power Marketing Center has been created to
find new ways of doing business as deregulation takes hold.  The
Environmental Technology Conference and Expo will explore the
integration of energy and environmental issues from water resource
management and pollution prevention to indoor air quality improvement
and CFC phaseout.  The Plant & Facilities Expo provides maintenance
and operation solutions that are practical and cost effective.
 Features of this year's program include Energy Purchase
and Services, Energy Management, and Operation and Maintenance
Management.  Mark Ginsberg, Director of FEMP, will discuss successful
energy efficiency in the Federal sector through barrier reduction.
The WEEC will take place November 6-8, 1996 at the Georgia World
Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia.
