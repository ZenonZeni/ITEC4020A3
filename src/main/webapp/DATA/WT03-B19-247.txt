Major regional areas and centres
</H1>

<B><I>Geelong</I></B>
<P>
Geelong, Victoria's second largest city with a regional population of about 
199,000, is one of the most highly industrialised centres in Australia. 
Located 75 kilometres from Melbourne on Port Phillip Bay, the Geelong 
region offers big city amenities in a rural environment close to 
the sea. Deakin University in Geelong was the first university to be established
outside the Melbourne metropolitan area. The region has an abundance of land 
available for residential and business use. The Port of Geelong and Avalon, 
Victoria's second international cargo airport, are major transport assets 
in the area. Manufacturing is the major industry, in particular 
automotive (including Ford), textiles, clothing and footwear, aluminium (Alcoa),
steel products, petroleum (Shell Refining), cement, and food processing.
The region is seeking to expand business opportunities in such areas as 
food processing, high technology, research and development, tourism, 
aerospace and textiles.
<P>

<B><I>Latrobe region</I></B>

<P>
The Latrobe region is 150 kilometres east of Melbourne with a population 
of about 74,000. Its main urban centres are Moe, Morwell and Traralgon. 
It is an industrial area based on large deposits of brown coal. 
Electricity generated from this coal at Yallourn, Morwell and Loy Yang provides 
90% of Victorias needs. The other major resource-based industry is forest 
and paper products manufacturing (including Australian Paper). These 
industries have resulted in the development of a highly trained technical and 
trades-based labour force. The establishment of the Australian Securities 
Commissions Information Processing Centre in Traralgon is an important 
example of the diversification of the economic structure that is occurring 
in the region. Monash University is also a key player. It is a partner in 
the ceramic fuel cells facility and provides joint training with industry.
There is also scope for growth in information processing, energy-related 
research and development, tourism, furniture and agriculture-based manufactures.
<P>

<B><I>Albury-Wodonga</I></B>

<P>
Albury-Wodonga, which straddles the Victorian-New South Wales border, is at the
hub of the Hume Transport Corridor (with both highway and rail access) and 
is easily able to service the major markets in both States. Regular air 
services also connect Albury-Wodonga to Melbourne and Sydney. The operation 
of an inland port with customs and quarantine services and bond storage 
facilities permits the direct consignment of exports and imports. The 
regional population is around 93,000.
<P>
Manufacturing is a major industry with key sectors including food - 
predominantly meat processing (Uncle Bens and Wodonga Meats are two large firms 
located in the area) - paper products (Australian Newsprint Mills) and 
automotive components (BTR Engineering). Diversification is occurring 
with a new information data processing service for banks and other 
institutions being established by Brambles. Tourism is also an important 
activity in the region while beef cattle production is the major 
agricultural industry.
<P>

<B><I>Ballarat</I></B>

<P>
Ballarat, 110 kilometres west of Melbourne and with a population of nearly 
76,000, is a major commercial and industrial centre for much of western 
Victoria. It is linked to Melbourne by dual carriage freeway (the Western 
Highway) and to rail services providing access to the Ports of Melbourne and 
Geelong.
<P>
The economy is based on manufacturing, mining, agriculture, education and 
tourism. The region has high quality agricultural land which produces wool, 
meat (beef and sheep), cereals and potatoes.
<P>
The key manufacturing sectors in the region include automotive components 
(Bendix Mintex, Australian Timken), food processing (McCains and Mars 
Confectionery), clay products, engineering, clothing and footwear.
<P>
Opportunities for further development include mining-related activities 
(gold, clay and other minerals), food processing, information technology-
related ventures, metal manufacturing, tourism and education services.
A major new $100 million development is the IBM/BHP Data Centre. 

<P>

<B><I>Bendigo</I></B>

<P>
Bendigo is at the geographical centre of Victoria and is the gateway to the 
Murray-Darling Basin, a major agricultural region. Local 150 kilometres 
north of Melbourne, Bendigo is less than two hours travel by road and 
rail. With its strategic location in the State at the hub of a radiating 
highway network, Bendigo also offers easy access to the major population 
centres of New South Wales and South Australia.
<P>
With a population of nearly 83,000, Bendigo supports a variety of industrial 
and agricultural enterprises. Important manufacturing sectors include heavy 
engineering (Australian Defence Industries and the foundry operations 
of Keech Casting, recently relocated from Sydney), clothing (The Stafford 
Group), automotive components (Empire Rubber) and non-metallic mineral products.
Poultry processing is another important industry. Tourism, largely based 
on the region's gold mining history, is a growing industry.
<P>
There is significant potential for growth in the developing customer servicing 
area of information and data processing, food processing, tourism and 
poultry production.
<P>

<B><I>Shepparton</I></B>

<P>
Sometimes referred to as the food bowl of Victoria, the Shepparton region 
has capitalised on its rich and diverse agricultural base by encouraging 
the establishment of a high value adding and export-oriented food 
processing industry.
<P>
With a population of nearly 54,000, Shepparton is a major commercial centre 
for the Goulburn Valley region of Victoria and southern parts of New South 
Wales. As well as food processing - mainly fruit, vegetable and dairy 
processing (including SPC, Ardmona, Bonlac, Campbells Soups, Henry Jones 
(IXL) and Unifoods) - there is a range of supporting industries in engineering, 
packaging and road transport.
<P>
<B><I>Other regional centres</I></B>
<P>
There are a further 17 regional centres that offer the potential investor 
many choices. These include Ararat, Colac, Hamilton, Horsham, Mildura, 
Portland, Stawell, Swan Hill and Warrnambool in the west, with 
Castlemaine, Echuca, Maryborough, Wangaratta, Benalla and Seymour in the 
central area, and Bairnsdale and Warragul in the east.
