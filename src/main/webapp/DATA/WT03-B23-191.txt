<H3>General Information About Income and Wage Loss
</H3><P>You are entitled to recover lost wages and income due to accident-related
injuries. This includes both income lost due to time spent unable to work,
and time missed because you were undergoing treatment for your injuries.
You have the same right to recover whether you work full-time, part-time,
or are self-employed.
<P>You may be entitled wage loss reimbursement even if you receive sick pay,
vacation pay or disability pay. This is because you would have been entitled
to use that sick leave or vacation time for other periods when you might
have needed or wanted it. Therefore, using sick leave or vacation pay is
often considered the same as losing the pay itself.
<P>In addition to time lost from work, you may be entitled to be reimbursed
for work opportunities you lost due to your injuries. Proving a lost opportunity
(such as a job interview or a promotion) is much more difficult than showing
actual time loss from work. However, even if you cannot verify or quantify
this in a dollar amount, that lost potential income or opportunity may still
add to the value of your claim. How much the value is increased depends on
how strong your proof is, and how much income that lost opportunity might
have generated.
<P>It is important to remember that you must have <EM>medical
authorization</EM>  to be off work.  It is generally not sufficient that
you decide you don't feel up to a job; get your treating doctor's statement
that you are to spend that time recovering from your injuries.
<H3 align=center>DOCUMENTING THE CLAIM
</H3><P>The type of documentation required will depend upon how you were
employed and whether you are submitting a <A HREF="medwage.htm">PIP</A> claim
for wage loss.  The following information should give you some guidelines.
<H3>If You Are Regularly Employed by a Company
</H3><P>If you are regularly employed by someone else, verification is fairly
simple.  Have your employer write a letter on company stationery.  The letter
should include the following information:
<UL><LI>Your name.
<LI>Your job duties or position.
<LI>Rate of pay (salary and/or hourly wage rate prior to the injury).
<LI>Number of hours you normally work &amp; number of hours or days you missed
following the accident.  (Include days or partial days. You do not need to
indicate whether you used vacation time, sick leave, or a leave of absence.)
</UL><P>The insurance company may want some additional verification, but
this will be a good start.  In addition, be sure to get your doctor's statement
indicating the specific dates you were not able to work due to your injuries
from the accident.
<H3>If You Are Self-Employed, or Not Regularly Employed
</H3><P>If you are self-employed or not regularly employed, proving lost
income is more difficult, and the insurance company will definitely require
more detailed documentation.  You need to be able to prove <EM>net loss of
earnings</EM>, which is gross income less expenses.  In other words, if you
are a contractor who is unable to work for three months following an auto
accident, and you would have had gross income of $30,000 and expenses of
$17,000 (cost of materials, labor, etc.), then your net loss of earnings
is $13,000.
<P>Carefully document how much time you were unable to work, what your gross
earnings would have been had you been able to work, and what your expenses
would have been.  The insurance company will most likely require tax returns
for the past 2 or 3 years.
<P>If you had been working consistently before the accident, you can show
an average for the period by putting together copies of billing statements,
invoices, payments received or other evidence of income earned. You may need
to include letters from individuals indicating your services would have been
used had you been able to work. From this information you can calculate how
much income you lost for the time you were unable to work due to injuries.
<P>If your work income fluctuates during the year, you may be able to document
the value of lost work time by showing what you normally earn during an entire
year, then dividing into weekly or monthly averages.  However, if the work
is seasonal, you will need to take that into account.
<P>If your income was particularly low after the accident due to your injuries,
you can demonstrate how much you normally earned by using several years of
tax returns.
<P>In any event, be sure to get your doctor's statement indicating the specific
dates you were not able to work due to your injuries from the accident.
