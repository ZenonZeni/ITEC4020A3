<h3>Seeking info</h3>
<p>
Do you have any group dicussions or any organized e-mail service
where we can read and learn about disabed subjects? I try to
educate people about the disabled by describing my disablity and
experiences.  I would like to make people aware that even though
because I walk a little funny and talk with a speech defect I have
goals, dreams and desires like everyone else.  I want to work and
earn my money.  I have completed several computer courses and plan
to take more to improve my job skills.  I do not want pity but
respect.  If you have any comments or suggestions please e-mail.

<h3>Storm problems</h3>
<p>
I am a paraplegic.  I recently was "given" my new power wheelchair. 
It is
from Invacare - a Storm.  I am having difficulties with the castor
wheels,
the joystick, and the clamp that holds the power arm.  Invacare
says (through
my provider) that there should not be any problems with the wheels. 
Has
anyone else experienced these difficulties?  Do you have
information on how I
can get hold of Invacare and talk to them direct?  Please let me
know.

<h3>Thanks for info</h3>
<p>
I just want to thank you for the information you are providing on
line.  
As a hemiplegic, the computer is my adaptive tool for research. 
Your 
magazine seems to offer a constructive climate rather than the "sue
first, ask questions later" mentality.  This is important when
dealing 
with highly controversial and emotional subjects.  Many people seem
to be 
of the mind that you can and should force others to come around to
your 
way of thinking.  I can't tell you how many people honestly believe
the 
ADA says you HAVE to make your business accessible when, in fact,
most 
businesses only need to provide reasonable accomadation.  Sure,
total 
accessability would be a godsend, but this is life, it isn't
fair---or we 
wouldn't need accomadation in the first place.  
THANK YOU.  MAINSTREAM   is now a treasured bookmark!

<h3>Changing myths</h3>
<p>
As the parent of a mentally disabled child, I fell in love with
your magazine. 100% of my 
time is devoted to trying to change the myths and limits placed on
the disabled. I am 
just a flat broke mom using a donated computer, running an irc chat
channel called 
#forgotten_kids on the undernet, for parents of
emotionally/mentally/behaviorally 
disabled children. and have a website at
http://www.tach.net/forgotten_kids all thanks 
to the kind isp in my area that also donates the online time (about
400 hours a month).
Please let me know the limits to which i can quote, link etc your
info to my page for 
the parents. I hope we can work together.

<h3>I need help</h3>
<p>
I have just found your publication on the Net and I need some help.
I'm an RN who works at home with a wonderful 13 year old boy who is
a ventilator dependent quadraplegic. His mother has recently heard
rumors that the program which allows for his home care is in
jeopardy because of proposed cuts in Medicaid which are part of the
FY '97 budget. 
<p>
I'm not quite sure how to begin researching this topic or how to
work to make sure that these cuts (if proposed) don't become law.
I'm from Washington State and have sent e-mail requests about the
bill to Senators Murray and Gorton. My understanding is that 
the budget begins moving through Congress in June. 
<p>
I'm well aware of the benefits of this program and am willing to
contribute considerable time and effort to insure that it stays in
place.
<p>
Thank you for any help you can offer and keep up the good work.

<h3>Cybergimp</h3>
<p>
I just finished reading your article concerning whether "gimps"
should identify themselves as such when communicating via internet.
I am very new to the net and this is my first communication since
I began to explore the net. I had spent some time trying to decide
if I should pass myself off as just another able-bodied net-user.
Your article helped me to come to the conclusion that I should no
more pretend to be a non-wheelchair user than I should pretend not
to be Black. So thanks for your thoughts as an experienced user.

<h3>Articles online?</h3>
<p>
Maybe I'm missing something, but can a person read your magazine articles via your
web page, or do I have to subscribe to the paper edition?  I was reviewing the
contents page and would like to read some of the articles.

<h3>Hate crimes</h3>
<p>
I am a college student doing a report on hate crimes aimed at the
disabled people of the United States. At the moment, I am having
trouble finding information. Would you please send me any ideas on
where information could possibly be found. Thank you,

<h3>Diluting resources</h3>
<p>
I share your concerns that services may be cut back for
people who really need them. However, part of the
problem is that so many situations have been labelled 
as disabilities that it tends to dilute out the finite amount
of resources available even during a booming economy,
as well as public support for same. One need only look
at "disabilities" such as drug and alcohol addiction,
dyslexia, ADD, etc. to see what I mean. A similar problem
has been seen in the ADA, which has made employers
more timid about being inclusive and accommodating for fear of 
litigation.
<p>
I believe that those who would speak for those with mobility
limitations would do better to separate their issues from those
with mental or other types of disabilities, and to seek strategies
that would allow more support for things such as insurance coverage
for mobility aids, elimination of physical barriers, adaptive living,
home health care, housekeeping, shopping services, aide services, 
portability and availability of private insurance, asset limits for
receiving disability assistance, and the like.
<p>
Rather than simply targeting the GOP, it would be more effective to 
seize on those issues they are touting for which there may be some
common ground. Otherwise you will continue to see a system that may be
broad in scope (to get more votes) but shallow in depth--much like the
system we have now.

<h3>Any ideas?</h3>
<p>
I am a Professor at Casper College in Wyoming and in the process of
developing an assistive technology 2 year degree program. This type of
program has never been done before. The program will also include consumer
training and assistance, professional training, and regional resource
center for assistive and adaptive equipment.
<p>
We are working with the RESNA group on the new ATP credidentialing.
We hope to develop individuals that specialize in adaptive and assistive
equipment to assist O.T.'s, P.T.'s, other professionals, and consumers in
evaluation, selection, training and making it all work. We are also
including the technology tranfer group of wyoming (WYNOT) so we can train
professionals, consumers, care givers.
<p>
I am in the process of developing a needs assessment for the degree plan.
This must be submitted to our state college commission before anything else
gets done. The needs assessment must include the projected job market and
pay for next 5 years for local, regional and national. The problem I am
having is that this degree plan has never been done before and is a new
career area. The way our college system works, we need a degree plan in
place so we can do training for professionals and consumers.
<p>
If you have any ideas or would like further information please let me
know. I would appreciate any input or support you might have.

<h3>Important link</h3>
<p>
Thank you for all you're doing. This is an important link for our
"Community of the Able-Disabled"! I am so glad to find you On-Line!
I was very inspired by some of the articles in a previous issue.
Are those older issues availaible anywhere? On-Line? or in Print?
Can there be an index of topics and /or titles?
<p>
Thanks again,
