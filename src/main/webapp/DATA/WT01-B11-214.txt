<B>Now Illegal To Buy Or Sell Angler-Caught Fish
</B>
</CENTER><P>
Under an amendment to the Game and Fish Act, anglers, who fish anywhere in Ontario, are prohibited from selling their catches of fish. It is also illegal for anyone to purchase fish caught by anglers.<P> 

The amendment to Section 72, which took effect January 1, 1996, states: "Except under the authority of a licence and in accordance with the regulations, no person shall sell, offer for sale, purchase, barter, culture or be concerned in the sale, purchase, barter or culture of fish other than species designated in the regulation."<P>

Yellow perch angled from the waters of Lake St. Francis in eastern Ontario may continue to be sold, but only within the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.<P>

The sale of angler-caught fish has long been an issue within Ontario's angling community. With this new regulation, angling will focus on the recreational values of fishing and no longer involve commercialization of the fish caught.<P>
