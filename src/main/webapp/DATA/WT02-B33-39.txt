SPEED SENSE

The control of vehicle speed is an emotive issue for most motorists.
Increasingly, though, the effective regulation of speeds is seen as a
tool for making better use of the road system, reducing accident rates
and limiting the environmental impacts of car use.

After a hard-fought battle between the pro and anti lobbies, President
Clinton signed the bill that ended the 55 mph (88 km/h) national speed
limit in the US. Individual states are now free to set their own limits
or, indeed, to have none. The national limits, thoroughly unpopular in
western and southern states, were set by Congress in 1973 as an energy
conservation and safety measure. The most worrying facet of the
abolition of the national speed limits was that the environmental
implications of speed merited barely a sentence in the congressional
and public debates on the issue. The discussion focused almost
exclusively on safety concerns.

Speed is an important factor in determining the emissions from a car.
Essentially, a vehicle is at its least polluting (per mile travelled)
when it is travelling at a constant speed of around 45 mph (72 km/h).
As the speed moves away from this value and/or the journey becomes
stop/start in nature, emissions tend to increase. Specifically, as
speeds rise above 55 mph, the environmental implications are
significant:

* a vehicle travelling at 65 mph (105 km/h) emits 100% more carbon
monoxide than the same vehicle travelling at 55mph, as well as 50% more
hydrocarbons and 31% more nitrogen oxides;

* passenger cars and light trucks use about 50% more fuel travelling at
75 mph (121 km/h) than they do at 55 mph. This translates directly into
increased CO2 emissions.

Despite the clear implications of increased speeds for emissions of CO2
and toxic pollutants, the protagonists in the US debate talked only of
safety and their concerns over security of oil supply. This narrow
vision seems all the stranger for a nation that has a history of
adopting the most stringent vehicle emissions legislation in the world.
Moreover, the debates came as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change were re-confirming their belief that global climate change is
happening and that action is required to reduce CO2 emissions.

Of course, no one is pretending that the 55 mph speed limit was being
obeyed police tended not to stop drivers doing 10 mph greater than the
speed limit anyway and the law was often described as the most flouted
in America. In general, research shows that without stringent
enforcement, drivers travel at whatever speed they feel comfortable
with, regardless of official speed limits. In this sense, bad speed
limits can be defined as those that are poorly enforced.

The abolition of the national speed limit in the US comes at an
interesting time for speed discussions. Throughout Europe, attitudes to
speed limits and controls are changing. In the UK, the M25 has recently
become the subject of a controlled motorway trial with variable speed
limits employed in an attempt to make better use of the road space.
Message signs are used to show a mandatory speed limit depending on
traffic levels measured by underground sensors. The preliminary results
show smoother traffic flows and reduced delays with a consequent
reduction in fuel use and emissions.

At a European level, legislation was introduced recently to fit speed-
governors that physically limit the speed of coaches and heavy trucks.
Even in Germany, the no limit rule on the Autobahns was recently
reviewed as the country was hit by episodes of high pollution. Indeed,
the absence of a German speed limit is currently the subject of a legal
challenge from an environmental transport group.

By combining the intelligent use of speed limits with developments in
areas such as obstacle sensors and route guidance, the future holds
genuine gains in terms of improving the efficiency with which the road
networks can be used. As the American experience shows, any speed
regulation must be accompanied by effective enforcement technological
developments such as speed cameras and radar systems provide the means
for such a system to exist. Providing speed regulation does not end up
merely stimulating more traffic, thereby recreating the original
congestion, there are clear environmental and operational benefits
available.

Whatever individual states decide to do with their new-found speed
limit powers, the quality of debate exhibited in the USA seems to
indicate that Europe is genuinely a step ahead in terms of
understanding the environmental benefits available from sensible speed-
control measures.

BRAZIL RETAINS FUEL-ALCOHOL PROGRAMME

Brazil continues to pursue its controversial policy of supporting the
use of alcohol as a fuel for road vehicles. An executive committee has
decided to retain the programme of subsidies for fuel alcohol produced
from Brazilian sugar cane. The market for alcohol is also guaranteed by
the committee's decision to maintain the 22% minimum alcohol content in
petrol.

Further, the committee has entered into talks with sugar cane growers
and distillers to look for methods of promoting the creation of a green
fleet in Brazil. The resulting scheme is likely to provide subsidies to
encourage buses, taxis and other urban public vehicles to switch to
fuel with a higher alcohol content.

NATURAL GAS HEAVY-DUTY ENGINE MEETS ULEV STANDARDS

Thermo Power Corporation has succeeded in producing a natural gas heavy-
duty engine capable of meeting the USA's Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle
(ULEV) standards. The ULEV standard is the next most stringent standard
after the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) category, and Thermo Power's
engine is the first natural gas engine to be granted ULEV status. The
engine's success further extends the potential market for NG heavy duty
vehicles into those areas where the most stringent exhaust standards
are in operation.

Thermo Power's Tecodrive engine is based on a 4.3 litre General Motors
Corporation petrol engine block. Thermo Power modified the original
engine for optimal operation on natural gas by using an advanced
natural gas fuel-injection system and closed-loop electronic controls.
The result is an engine that provides performance similar to a petrol
version, while producing much lower emissions the engine easily meets
the ULEV standard, producing just 6% of the permitted amount of non-
methane hydrocarbon emissions, 16% of the carbon monoxide limit and 45%
of the nitrogen oxides standard.

The engine's development was partly supported by the US Department of
Energy, and its first commercial use will be in 276 vehicles for UPS.

FUEL CELL VEHICLE HITS THE MARKET

The first vehicle powered by a fuel cell has entered the market place
in the US. Fuel cells are mini power-plants that produce power by
combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water without
combustion and, perhaps more importantly, without pollution. Fuel cells
have long been seen as the ultimate clean, alternative power source for
vehicles. However, their rapid development in recent years has meant
that they are now being taken seriously.

The Genesis ZEV's specification and performance mean that manufacturers
of conventional vehicles can, for now, rest easily. The Genesis uses a
7.5kW fuel cell, runs for three hours on a full tank of hydrogen, has a
range of around 45 miles and a reckless top speed of 15 mph. Fuel tanks
hold compressed oxygen and hydrogen and these can be refilled in 15
minutes. The vehicle is intended for use in operations such as airport
cargo hauling, grounds maintenance, or as a people mover in amusement
parks.

The vehicle and associated fuelling stations were developed in a
collaborative effort by Energy Partners Inc., Western Golf Car and
Telesis Cogeneration. The Big Three vehicle manufacturers in the US all
have fuel cell development programmes in conjunction with the US
Department of Energy. A variety of independent programmes is also under
way throughout Europe and North America. Most recently, Chicago Transit
Authority started a two year trial operating three buses powered by
Ballard fuel cell engines. The power density of fuel cells is being
constantly improved, and their use in vehicles will become more
widespread as more progress is achieved.

NATURAL GAS VEHICLE WINS AWARD

A natural gas vehicle design has been recognised by Popular Science
magazine as one 1995's 100 greatest achievements in science and
technology. The Advanced Natural Gas Vehicle (ANGV) was designed and
developed by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore. The ANGV is based on a modified subcompact car a
Geo Prism and has a driving range of 300 miles with performance
comparable to the original petrol version.

GAS BUSES FOR SOUTHAMPTON

Southampton Citybus and British Gas have signed a ten-year agreement as
part of a scheme to introduce natural gas buses to Southampton. British
Gas will build, equip and operate a gas filling station in the company
s bus depot. Hampshire County Council and the UK Department of
Transport are supporting an initiative to convert six buses to gas,
with a further 10 provided through other government funding.

The agreement was announced before the much anticipated tax break for
natural gas was disclosed in the UK budget. The financial advantages
brought by the reduced fuel duty can be expected to boost the number of
UK schemes for natural gas vehicles in the coming months.

JAPAN HELPS THAILAND WITH FUEL TESTING AND SPECIFICATION

Japan has announced a four year project with Thailand as part of its
continuing policy of technical support to South-east Asian countries
suffering air pollution problems. Beginning in March 1996, the
Petroleum Energy Centre (PEC) of Japan will transfer technologies to
its Thai counterpart, the Petroleum Authority of Thailand. The transfer
will enable the Thai organisation to carry out its own analysis in the
search for cleaner fuels and oils.

The project will involve Japan supplying both expertise and equipment
so that fuels and lubricant specifications can be defined that are most
suitable for the prevailing conditions in Thailand.

MOBIL LAUNCHES CLEANER DIESEL

Mobil has launched a new diesel fuel, Cleanerburn Diesel Plus, which it
claims produces 30% less particulate emissions and 80% less black smoke
emissions than ordinary diesel fuel. Hopes of reduced duty for this
type of cleaner burning diesel were not realised in the UK Budget (NEWS
ANALYSIS, December) and the extra refining processes involved mean that
such fuels are more expensive to manufacture than standard fuels. As a
result, without subsidy, their use in the UK is likely to remain
limited.

GENERAL MOTORS PUNISHED FOR POLLUTING CADILLACS

General Motors (GM) faces a bill of around $45m as punishment for
fitting inadequate pollution control devices to nearly 500,000
Cadillacs. Although GM agreed to the settlement, it continues to
dispute the allegations made by the US EPA that form its basis.

The punishment was agreed with the US Department of Justice, on behalf
of the EPA, for installing illegal devices in Cadillacs that defeat
pollution controls. The guilty device is an engine control system
designed to remedy stalling problems that had occurred when drivers of
the 4.9 litre, V8 engine Cadillacs turned on their climate control
systems. The device works by increasing the fuel to air ratio when the
air conditioning system is in use.

Problems arise because the engine control system overrides the emission
control system, resulting in emissions of carbon monoxide that are
three times the legal limit. GM failed to disclose the use of the
device or its adverse effect on pollution control. However, the EPA
discovered the problem in 1993 during routine emissions testing and
subsequently charged GM with violations of the Clean Air Act. The EPA
estimates that the use of the device has resulted in the additional
release of approximately 100,000 tonnes of carbon monoxide.

The agreement makes three demands of GM:

* a civil fine of $11 million;

* the 470,000 Cadillacs sold since 1991 must be recalled and repaired:
the repair involves fitting a new engine control system to each vehicle
and the whole exercise will cost around $25 million; and

* $8.75m to establish an emission remedial project fund to finance
schemes to reduce air pollution. The fund will be used to repair the
damage done by the Cadillacs and is likely to be used for schemes to
accelerate the scrapping of old, polluting cars and buses.

The punishment forms a landmark in that it involves the first judicial
vehicle recall on environmental grounds, and the fine of $11m ranks as
the second largest meted out under the Clean Air Act.

The settlement has left General Motors feeling rather embittered with
the EPA and the Justice Department. GM issued a statement in which it
made clear that the company strongly disagreed with the allegations
made and considered the issue to be a matter of interpretation of
current regulations . The company stressed that it had agreed with the
settlement as an appropriate resolution of the issue, in line with its
environmental commitment.

PARTICULATE REDUCTION SYSTEMS ON TRIAL IN LONDON BUSES

Rival systems for reducing emissions of harmful particulates are
undergoing trials with two bus firms in London.

EZ Traps have been fitted to four buses operated by Leaside buses. The
system is manufactured by Lubrizol and involves the addition of a
liquid catalyst to the diesel fuel. Results so far are very promising,
showing a reduction in particulate emissions of between 69% and 98%.

Continuously regenerating traps have been developed by Johnson Matthey
and Eminox and are currently being tested by Stagecoach in east London.
No results from this trial are currently available.

Vehicles such as buses and trucks have extended lifetimes and retro-
fitting of particulate reduction systems may be required if urban air
quality standards for this pollutant are to be met.

MEXICO CITY TIGHTENS CAR CONTROLS

As anticipated in last month's NEWS ANALYSIS, Mexico City's authorities
have introduced further measures to tackle the city's dramatic
pollution problems. Phase one of the ambitiously titled Plan to Solve
Atmospheric Problems was introduced in December 1995 and includes an
extension of the ban on each car's use during winter smog episodes from
one day a week to two. It has been estimated that this measure will
result in around 20% less traffic. Phase one also involves cutting
industrial emissions by up to 40% during smog emergencies. Despite
this, critics have argued that the plan imposes the heaviest burden on
motorists while not doing enough to reduce factory emissions.

In 1992, a government study concluded that 76% of air pollution was due
to vehicles. More recently, a study by the University of California-
Irvine concluded that the majority of smog came from cooking fuel.
Whatever the source of the emissions, the authorities have been forced
into action by recent episodes of poor air quality. In the week prior
to the announcement of the new measures, air pollution was grave enough
to cause breathing problems for around 400,000 of the city's 20 million
inhabitants. With ozone levels reaching twice the acceptable limits,
factories were asked to reduce production and outdoor school activities
were prohibited.

CHINA'S POLLUTION PROBLEMS WORSEN

China is experiencing an increasingly serious rise in motor vehicle
emissions that has led to Beijing's vehicle pollution problems
surpassing those of Los Angeles and Tokyo. That is the finding of a
recent study, Automobile Emissions Control Equipment, commissioned by
the US and Foreign Commercial Service.

One of the main problems cited was poor manufacturing techniques that
have contributed to making emission levels from Chinese-made
automobiles dozens of times higher than those in the developed
countries . Most of the 10 million vehicles produced in China every
year have no emissions control equipment and only in recent months have
the Chinese authorities started to examine the issue of vehicle
emissions. The problem requires urgent attention as the number of
privately registered cars is forecast to rise to 18 million by 2000
with rapid growth to 44 million by 2010.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY

The last month has been dominated by discussion of the reconsideration
of California's 1998 ZEV mandate (December's NEWS ANALYSIS). Changes to
the California Air Resources Board (CARB) mandate are still under
consideration and fresh rumours circulate almost daily. The most likely
alterations to the scheme incorporate the following:

* large demonstration fleets of electric vehicles may be required for
the years 1998 to 2000. The numbers under consideration are 750
electric vehicles for 1998, with 1,500 in the two subsequent years.
After the year 2000, CARB are likely to insist on retaining the ZEV
sales targets for 2001 (5% of sales) and 2003 (10%).

* the development and use of advanced batteries would be encouraged by
awarding EVs using such batteries multiple sales credits. For instance,
the sale of an EV using an advanced nickel-metal hydride battery might
merit three credits while a vehicle with a conventional lead-acid
battery would only rate a single credit. In this way, a vehicle
producer could amass sufficient EV credits to meet any mandate by
selling a smaller number of vehicles fitted with advanced batteries.

* CARB is likely to insist on maintaining the established goals for
cutting pollution. For instance, the equivalent air pollution goals to
a 2% ZEV mandate could be met by producing cleaner burning petrol cars
or vehicles using alternative fuels such as natural gas.

The ongoing review and possible changes to California's 1998 mandate
have left the plans of New York, Massachusetts and Vermont a little
exposed. These states opted into the ZEV mandate scheme under the
Northeast Ozone Transport Region's plans. It remains unclear whether
these states can maintain their plans for ZEV sales in 1998 without the
momentum provided by California.

Aside from the negotiations and political manoeuvrings, a new study has
cast doubt upon manufacturers high price projections for EVs. Pricing
for Success: Using Auto Industry Models to Review Electric Vehicle
Costing and Pricing was compiled by Green Car Media, an independent
research organisation. The study claims that the price estimates for
electric vehicles are arbitrarily high and do not reflect typical
policy as they involve the absorption of all development costs into the
vehicle price. The study concludes that the current high price
estimates have resulted in false and disappointing market projections
for electric vehicles.

SOLECTRIA SUNRISE CONTINUES TO IMPRESS

The Solectria Sunrise, the world's first all-composite electric vehicle
designed for mass production, has passed the necessary safety tests and
will begin production in 1998.

The Sunrise employs the AC induction drive system currently used in
Solectria's production electric vehicles, the Force sedan and E-10
pickup truck. The new model makes use of proven components alongside
high energy-density Ovonic nickel- metal hydride batteries and uses
lightweight composite materials throughout. The resulting vehicle is a
full-size, four-passenger sedan, shown to be capable of 238 miles on a
single charge in the 1995 American Tour de Sol electric vehicle road
rally. Further refinement to the design has been made possible by
additional funding received from the National Institute of Standards
and Technology.

Twenty commuters are currently leasing Solectria Force sedans in
Massachusetts and rate their overall satisfaction at 8 out of a maximum
10 points. Solectria claim that these results demonstrate that today's
technology already satisfies the performance and range requirements of
the average urban commuter. They hope to further consolidate this claim
when production of the Sunrise begins.

EV TRIALS IN WESTMINSTER

An #800,000 project in the London Borough of Westminster is set to
introduce up to 25 ZEVs to the city. The scheme is intended to promote
interest in electric vehicles amongst fleet and taxi operators.

A network of recharging stations will be installed at council and
public sites and will be available for use by any suitable electric
vehicle. The council will purchase two cars and two vans for its own
use and will also operate a fleet of five electric taxis from mainline
railway stations. Local fleet operators will be encouraged to purchase
the remaining 16 vehicles available.

The scheme is backed by electricity generator PowerGen, the Department
of Trade and Industry and manufacturers Carbodies and Wavedriver. If
the trials are successful, it is hoped that the 18 month project can be
extended to include neighbouring boroughs and other private operators.

ALUMINIUM USE ON THE INCREASE

Aluminium continues to grow in importance as a material for use in cars
and trucks. In 1994, vehicles became the largest market for the metal
in North America. The annual amount employed has almost doubled during
the last ten years and overall use rose by 15% from 1993 to 1994. All
evidence points to continuing increases in its use as the metal becomes
more important in manufacturers efforts to produce lower-weight
vehicles.

IMCO EXPANDS ALUMINIUM CAPABILITIES

A new aluminium recycling plant is to be built in the USA in a joint
venture by IMCO Recycling Inc. and Alchem Aluminium.

The plant is expected to begin production by the end of 1996 and will
be used to supply recycled metal in molten form, around half of which
will be used by Alchem to produce specification aluminium alloys that
are sold principally to automobile companies and manufacturers of
vehicle components. Michigan, Ohio and Indiana are the sites under
consideration for the new plant.

The new plant will mark a further step for IMCO, the world's largest
specialist aluminium recycler, into the rapidly growing vehicle market
for aluminium. IMCO has already acquired four US plants that supply
recycled aluminium for the manufacture of car components. The firm is
also launching a joint venture with VAW Aluminium AG of Germany to
supply the European market.

JOHNSON CONTROLS USES RECYCLED DRINK BOTTLES TO MAKE SEATS

Johnson Controls has developed an innovative system that enables soft
drink bottles to be recyled for use in car seats. The company's
Automotive Systems Group is the world's leading supplier of automotive
seating and now employs PET (polyethylene terephthalate) from recycled
plastic drink bottles to manufacture pads for seat backs and cushions.
The first seats manufactured in this way were shown at last year's
Frankfurt Motor Show.

PET seat pads have a number of advantages over the polyurethane foam
pads used in most seats at present. PET-based pads are lighter in
weight, offer more breathability , and can be moulded into a wider
variety of densities for many seating applications. In addition to
their recycled content, the PET-based pads are themselves recyclable.
Further, no adhesives or hazardous chemicals are used in the
manufacturing process and no emissions are produced.

In addition to the use of PET in its seats, Johnson Controls is also
striving to make the seats themselves easier to disassemble and
recycle. This can be achieved by reducing the number of parts used,
standardizing fasteners and avoiding the use of insert-moulded plastic
parts.

FIAT TO EXPAND RECYCLING OFFER

Starting in January of this year, Italian drivers can leave any make of
old car at a Fiat retailer without charge and without being obliged to
purchase a new Fiat car. The firm is offering an assurance that it will
forward the vehicles to an ecologically sound recycling centre.

By expanding its scheme, Fiat is aiming to recycle 100,000 of the 1.5
million cars scrapped in Italy each year. The programme will form
Europe's biggest car recycling project, and builds on the success of
previous company initiatives which have so far involved recycling
150,000 cars with the recovery of 2,700 tonnes of glass, 900 tonnes of
plastic and 1,100 tonnes of upholstery.

Technical details of Fiat's FARE recycling scheme can be found in
October 1995's issue of AEA.

ZEXEL DEVELOPS MEMBRANE TO IMPROVE ENGINE FUEL EFFICIENCY

Zexel has developed a diamond-like carbon membrane that can be placed
inside a vehicle's fuel pump to allow ultra-high-pressure fuel
injection in compact diesel engines. Previous fuel efficiency
improvements for this type of engine have focused on particulate
reduction methods.

GREENPEACE DESIGNS CAR

In an intriguing change of role, one of the traditional adversaries of
the motor industry, Greenpeace, has designed a fuel-efficient car. The
environmental pressure group decided to take to the drawing board after
being frustrated with what they saw as industry's intransigence in
reducing the fuel consumption of new cars.

The aim of the project was to demonstrate that safety and performance
need not suffer in the drive to produce a more environmentally friendly
car. The venture began with a production model Renault Twingo and a
target of 50% improvement in fuel efficiency. Three Swiss companies
(Wenko AG, Esoro AG and BRM Design) were commissioned to help in the
transformation of the car. The main changes made were:

* Engine: the original engine has been replaced with a smaller,
supercharged four- stroke petrol engine. This engine produces the same
output (50 hp) as the engine in the production model whilst consuming
significantly less fuel. A diesel engine was ruled out on the grounds
of its weight and complexity along with the potential health threats
from particulates.

* Weight: a group of designers modified the standard car body to reduce
the vehicle weight by about 20%, from 810kg to 650kg.

* Wind resistance: wind tunnel tests showed that alterations to the
vehicle had also succeeded in producing a 30% reduction in wind
resistance.

Other modifications included the introduction of tyres with lower
rolling resistance, and the fitting of a speed governor set at 130 km/h
(80 mph).

The vehicle was scheduled to undergo road and fuel consumption tests
during December 1995. Prior to the results of those tests, Greenpeace
was anticipating that the car was capable of doing 100 kilometres on
between 3 and 3.5 litres of petrol, the equivalent of between 80 and 95
mpg. The modifications made to the vehicle would add around #1,000 to
the cost of a production Twingo. Of course, if significant fuel savings
were realised during actual use, the extra cost of the vehicle could
soon be recouped through reduced fuel costs.

Greenpeace claims that there is a market for highly fuel-efficient
vehicles, citing public opinion polls in Germany showing that two-
thirds of all car buyers would opt for such a car if it were offered
for sale. Despite its apparent design success, Greenpeace is at pains
to point out that the project is for demonstration purposes only and
that it has no intention of becoming a car manufacturer.

NEW ROVER 200 SERIES CARS DESIGNED FOR FUEL EFFICIENCY

The new Rover 200 Series models show innovative features in engine and
transmission design which contribute to better fuel efficiency and
lower emissions.

All of the 12 models available in the range use engines from Rover's K
(petrol) and L (diesel) series.

K Series engines: Four versions of the Rover K series engine feature in
the new 200 range, ranging from the 1.4 litre, 8-valve 75PS unit to the
1.8 litre 16 valve 145PS unit fitted with Rover's patented Variable
Valve Control system.

All of the engines in the K family feature ultra-light sandwich
construction of low pressure aluminium sand castings, held together by
high-tensile through-bolts for strength and low distortion. Efficiency
is a key concern and is apparent throughout from the advanced
combustion management to the low coolant volume, which gives a fast
warm-up ensuring minimum emissions and fuel consumption from a cold
start.

All 1.4 and 1.6 litre engines in the 200 range have a grouped injection
strategy, in which alternate pairs of injectors are fired in turn,
giving improved efficiency compared with the previous method of banked
injection where all four injectors fired simultaneously.

L Series engines: Two versions of the L series direct injection 2 litre
turbo-diesel engine are available in the 200 range. The lower-cost
version has conventional mechanically-controlled fuel injection, and
develops a maximum power output of 86PS.

Of more interest is the sophisticated 105PS version. This engine
employs an ultra- efficient combustion system, with near-vertical fuel
injectors firing directly into compact re-entrant shaped combustion
chambers formed in the tops of the pistons. Two-stage fuel injection
allows quieter and cleaner operation by initiating combustion more
progressively.

Emissions control features include exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),
which adds a calculated amount of exhaust gas to the inlet charge to
limit combustion temperatures and minimise emissions of nitrogen
oxides. A two-way oxidising catalyst is also fitted to the exhaust
system to reduce emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and
particulates.

All of the models in the 200 series are capable of meeting the next
stage of European Union emissions legislation which comes into effect
in 1997.

Transmissions: In addition to the manual and conventional automatic
transmissions available, the 216 models are available with the option
of a CVT (continuously variable transmission). CVT provides a lively
response to the throttle but is also capable of delivering better fuel
economy than conventional automatic transmissions.

CVT effectively provides an infinite number of ratios instead of the
four or five ratio steps typically available. The key working parts are
two pulleys with conical driving faces which have working diameters
that can be varied by means of hydraulic control of the spacing between
the driving faces. In Rover's own tests, the vehicle fitted with CVT
showed better fuel economy than the vehicle with a conventional
automatic transmission. Indeed, the CVT car even bettered the economy
of the vehicle with a manual transmission.

US 55 MPH SPEED LIMIT ABOLISHED

Despite strong misgivings about the safety implications, President
Clinton has signed a bill which abolishes the US national speed limit
of 55 mph (88 km/h) and allows individual states to set their own
limits. The law came into effect in early December and nine of the 50
states had existing laws that automatically raised speed limits in the
absence of a national limit. A further 28 states are likely to
introduce speed limits set higher than 55 mph in the next few months.

The move has been greeted with despair by safety campaigners who claim
that an extra 6,000 deaths will result. Supporters of the limit's
abolition were jubilant and dismissed the safety fears as unjustified.
In reality, the effects of speed limits upon accident rates are complex
and there are numerous studies available to back up both sides of the
argument.

OECD RECOMMENDS THAT CANADA RAISE TRANSPORT TAXES

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has
recommended that Canada should increase the level of taxation on
transport to meet its commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In a review of Canada's environmental performance, the OECD points out
that Canada has committed to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions at 1990
levels by the year 2000 and thereafter to start reducing emissions.
However, current projections show a 13% increase in CO2 emissions
between 1990 and 2000. To help close the gap between projection and
target, the OECD recommends using economic instruments such as taxes
and other charges in the transportation sector. The study notes that
the Canadian tax on petrol represents about 47% of the consumer price,
one of the lowest proportions among OECD countries.

The review is being considered by the Canadian government and
indications so far are that the recommendations may be acted upon. The
Canadian environment minister, Sheila Copps, has made it clear that she
is examining the whole range of fiscal options including raising
existing taxes, introducing new charges and adopting a system of
tradeable permits. Ms Copps concurs with the OECD's view that voluntary
measures will be insufficient to meet Canada's stabilisation target for
CO2.

THAI GOVERNMENT TO CRACK DOWN ON MOTORCYCLES

The Thai government is understood to be studying new incentives to
reduce pollution. The newly elected administration of Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-archa has made it clear that it intends to introduce
policies based upon the polluter pays principle. Specifically targeted
in the vehicle sector will be motorcycles powered by highly polluting
two-stroke engines. Around 500,000 such vehicles are sold annually and
they can be expected to be subject to much higher sales tax in 1996.

Thailand's new-found environmental concern follows persistent criticism
of the government for neglecting the environment in its drive towards
rapid economic development.

EC VEHICLE RECYCLING DIRECTIVE THIS YEAR

The European Commission is preparing a new directive aimed at
harmonising the recycling of vehicles across member states. The
production of a Waste Framework Directive was listed in the Commission
s work programme for 1996.

It is widely anticipated that the directive will place responsibility
for end-of-life recovery upon the motor industry. To promote recycling,
the directive is also likely to include provisions for scrapping
incentives so that owners of old, highly polluting vehicles are
encouraged to trade them in for less polluting new cars.

The detailed timetable for the proposal of the directive is uncertain
as the Commission is already facing a significant backlog of measures
carried forward from the 1995 work programme.

LOBBYING INCREASES ON US NLEV PROGRAMME

The US continues to supply the most engrossing of the big battles for
the motor industry. Currently, the EPA's proposal for a national low
emissions vehicle (NLEV) programme is causing friction between the
vehicle manufacturers and the oil companies. The programme is intended
to define a low-emissions vehicle for the entire US. Formal comments
are currently being made on the plan and lobbying by representatives of
the two protagonists has been intense.

The oil companies are concerned that they will be required to produce a
new fuel specification for the programme and have insisted that a
national fuel is technologically unnecessary for the achievement of
Clean Air Act goals. Further, in a now familiar refrain, the industry
has asserted that the provision of a national fuel would have a
devastating economic impact on the refining industry, jeopardising the
very existence of many firms.

For its part, the motor industry has long used the electric vehicle
mandates in California, New York, Massachusetts and Vermont as
bargaining counters in their negotiations on the NLEV scheme. Even with
California back-tracking on its mandate, the manufacturers continue to
assert that they cannot realistically move forward on the NLEV
programme until all the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandates have been
dropped.

Thus far, the EPA is retaining a cautious stance and has not shown
favour to either industry's viewpoint. However, once firm proposals are
made, the lobbying from all sides is expected to be stepped up another
gear.

IMPLICATIONS OF TRANSPORT POLICY FOR ENGINEERING INDUSTRY

The Engineering Employers Federation (EEF) has published a report that
considers the different aspects of transport policy and their
importance for the engineering industry. The body of the report
consists of a study carried out for the EEF by the Henley Centre that
considers the transport policies of the UK government along with those
proposed by opposition parties and special interest groups.

Based upon the findings of the Henley Centre study, the EEF calls for a
comprehensive and integrated transport strategy which effectively deals
with the issues of competitiveness and environmental protection . The
EEF lays particular emphasis upon the need for investment plans to
provide integrated transport systems and cleaner technologies.
Specifically, these plans should include a vision of the transport
technologies which will be available two or three decades ahead, in
order to realise the full potential of low-pollution vehicle
technologies. The EEF favours this approach rather than what they see
as the current trend of focusing upon restricting transport or travel
because of the shortcomings of current technologies. The report offers
support for the use of fiscal incentives to promote environmental
objectives and backs the SMMT's call for scrapping incentives to be
introduced.

The government is urged to resist the temptation to make further cuts
in infrastructure spending. The EEF are critical of the wild swings of
recent government investment in transport equipment and believe that
the lack of planning in investment policy shows that the government
lacks a credible industrial policy.

Mixed Signals: Implications of Transport Policy for the Engineering
Industry is available from EEF, Broadway House, Tothill Street, London

IPCC RE-AFFIRMS BELIEF IN GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE

The latest report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) shows greater consensus that global warming is
occurring and that human beings are responsible. The IPCC is made up of
around 2,500 scientists, climatologists and experts from more than 100
nations. The group's tasks comprise assessing the scientific evidence
of climate change, calculating its impact and devising responses.

The scientific part of the programme unveiled its latest report in Rome
last month. The group concluded that the balance of evidence suggests a
discernible human influence on global climate . The scientists also put
forward their best estimate that mean surface temperature will be 2oC
higher in the year 2100 than in 1990. This comparatively small increase
masks larger, localised temperature changes and important shifts in
climatic patterns such as storm frequencies.

Road traffic is the fastest growing source of carbon dioxide, the main
greenhouse gas, throughout much of the world. If evidence of climate
change continues to gather, attention will become increasingly focused
on the growing numbers of road vehicles and, more importantly, their
escalating use.

AA: RESPONSE TO THE GREAT TRANSPORT DEBATE

The UK Automobile Association (AA) has published its response to the 20
questions on transport and the environment posed by Dr Brian Mawhinney
when UK Secretary of State for Transport.

Some of the main opinions put forward by the AA are detailed below:

* CO2 emissions: transport is being unfairly targeted for reduced CO2
emissions by the annual increase in road fuel tax of 5% above
inflation. This policy does not make economic sense and should be
reviewed.

* Toxic emissions: effective policing of emissions from vehicles is
required, carried out at a local level. The AA supports the principle
of roadside emissions testing, as allowed under the 1995 Environment
Act.

* Traffic growth: economic growth and traffic growth cannot be
uncoupled to a significant extent. Restrictions on car use would
undoubtedly help improve air quality, but the improvements would be
marginal when compared with the gains already being brought about by
technological advances.

* Road pricing: user charging would have to be widely accepted as a
legitimate transport policy tool before it could be implemented. The AA
believes it to be a longer-term policy option.

* Motoring taxation: incentives should be used to encourage the sale of
vehicles with lower emissions. Further, a fundamental review of
motoring taxation is required, with a view to improving the
environmental performance of vehicles through fiscal incentives and
penalties.

In summary, the AA believes that the key to a successful transport and
environment strategy is a combination of investment to provide levels
of access at a standard people expect, and traffic restraint/
management that people accept as being sensible. The AA considers that
going with the grain of people's lives is the only way of securing
acceptable and achievable transport policy objectives if the electorate
cannot see the sense in the measure, or it is perceived to be unfair,
it will be rejected.

Transport: the way ahead the AA's response is available from AA Public
Policy (tel: 0 (44) 1256 491926).

BODY AND CHASSIS INNOVATIONS

Conference on Materials for Lean Weight Vehicles: Part One

Innovation, both in materials and in methods of assembling structural
components, was covered in a topical conference on Materials for Lean
Weight Vehicles organised by The Institute of Materials and held at
Warwick in the UK in late November 1995. It was attended by about 130
delegates, mainly from Europe and representing automotive
manufacturers, component makers, material suppliers and research
institutes. AEA attended and presents its summing up in two parts this
month covering the body and chassis papers.

Weight saving current position

Increases in the weight of the car of today stem from the modern
customer's requirement for increased safety, performance, comfort and
pleasure. Items which at one time were optional extras are now
standard, and this in turn spawns a new spate of optional extras as
manufacturers vie with each other to tempt the customer.

Despite the increasing use of lightweight materials the weight of cars
on average has increased. For example the kerb weight of a Ford Fiesta
in 1976 was about 700 kg and there was little difference between the
basic model and the high series; the 1994 version has a basic kerb
weight of about 800 kg rising to 1000 kg for the high series. However,
customers expect and even demand good driving characteristics in
acceleration and power, combined with improved fuel consumption and a
good image. Stronger engines are necessary to provide effective power.
But stronger engines require heavier transmission and suspension
components leading to further increases in vehicle weight.

Such changes have led the weight spiral, especially in luxury cars.
Acceleration, rolling and hill climbing resistance are directly
proportional to mass and combined probably make up between 70% and 80%
of the total road resistance. So, unchecked, a weight spiral leads
directly to progressive increases in road resistance and increased fuel
consumption. To break this, vehicle weight must be reduced.

The reduction of vehicle weight has focused on engineering effort
because lightweight component developments present potential
disadvantages which have to be resolved and which may require novel
technical or manufacturing solutions. Automotive manufacturers have to
comply with global legislation which is constantly being reviewed and
updated. Emissions regulations necessitate significant improvements in
engine and vehicle efficiency, and in the USA the Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) legislation dictates a minimum average fuel economy
across manufacturer's range. A lower weight vehicle facilitates
improved efficiency and can be achieved by vehicle downsizing, reducing
individual component weight contributions or an entirely new structural
design.

Lightweight structures may enable smaller engines to be used without
impairing performance. But there are problems. The cost of lighter
weight materials or associated process routes may be higher than for
established practice. This is likely to be so for advanced materials,
such as metal matrix composites (MMCs). Thus the rule must be to
minimise waste wherever possible by using near net shape techniques. It
should also be remembered that development of alternative materials and
processes inevitably incurs an element of additional cost which has to
be recovered through savings.

Moreover, confidence has to be gained by quality validation and
inspection analysis which must continue for a long period into the
initial production runs. Technical knowledge needs to be constantly
available for the volume supply of raw materials at acceptable cost and
for the processing route to achieve the required component forms. A co-
ordinated approach to component design philosophy is therefore
necessary since the materials, design form and manufacturing route are
intricately interlinked; and successful implementation of a weight
reduction programme will depend on sources and details of each of the
three elements. Computerised component design and analysis systems are
essential to enable the optimisation of shape to meet performance
criteria which can yield significant weight reductions in the use of
established or alternative materials.

The automobile body is the largest and also the heaviest individual
component, accounting for 20% to 30% of vehicle weight. It therefore
presents the greatest potential for reductions. Targeting body weight
also permits secondary savings. But reducing car weight must go hand in
hand with more rigidity, greater safety and better handling
characteristics. Hence the joining and forming methods and the chassis
should also come under the microscope.

Hypercars the next revolution

The Keynote Speaker was Mr Amory B Lovins, Director of Research, Rocky
Mountain Institute, Colorado, USA. Mr Lovins and his team have
developed a unique analytical approach to the design and manufacture of
the car, and his opening speech on Hypercars the next revolution fully
demonstrated this. He pointed out the conflict between customers
wanting better cars which often meant heavier cars and the pressures on
the car manufacturers to reduce the weight of cars to help in meeting
fuel emission regulations through improved fuel consumption. In the US,
average fuel consumption is levelling off at about 8 litres/100 km (35
mpg), with a target of achieving half that rate by the year 2005
through an incremental approach to design and manufacture.

Mr Lovins advocates a leapfrog approach by a direct attack on the
factors which are wasting much of the energy in the fuel. He cited drag
coefficient, frontal area, mass and tyre rolling resistance. Reducing
these would bring about spectacular results. To these improvements he
added a hybrid electric drive with electricity generated onboard
driving all four wheels and the recovery and storage of some of the
electrical energy for re-use. Finally a light carbon fibre body would
reduce the mass still further. He postulated that this approach could
achieve a fuel consumption of at least 4 litres/100 km by the year
2000. Mr Lovins analysis is fascinating and it is planned to give a
fuller account of his work in a later edition of Automotive Environment
Analyst.

Audi's experience with the A8

The first paper was presented by Mr H Behrens (Project Manager
Development, Audi AG) on The aluminium Audi A8 . Audi had collaborated
with Alcoa for over ten years to develop a new body technology called
the Audi Space Frame (ASF) which enabled them to produce the Audi A8,
the world's first automobile to be designed specifically for aluminium
production. The outcome was a vehicle body up to 40% lighter, yet more
rigid and thus safer than a comparable steel body. The body in white
(BIW) weighs about 247 kg, the same as that of the VW Golf BIW. After a
comprehensive analysis aluminium was chosen because:

* it is the third most common metal on earth: thus no potential supply
problems;

* it offers good weight reduction its density is about one third that
of steel;

* it has good dimensioning possibilities;

* it offers reduction in waste of raw material in production;

* the strength of deep drawn heat treated aluminium and steel are about
the same;

* it offers ease of recycling.

The main disadvantage of aluminium is that its elastic modulus and
therefore its stiffness is only about one third that of steel. This
dictated the use of an ASF into which each surface component is
integrated with a load bearing function. Novel features are a frame
structure of straight or curved extruded sections with vacuum
diecastings at nodal points where the loads are highest, together with
load bearing sheet aluminium surface components. Individual elements in
the frame are metal inert gas welded together and the sheet is joined
mainly by self-piercing punch rivets.

Safety is also an important feature. The combination of lightness and
rigidity means that an automobile with an ASF body performs better than
a heavier vehicle during a handling course. The ASF body easily
satisfies current safety legislation and combines two vital passive
safety features: a rigid cage-like passenger survival space and energy
absorbing members providing tolerable deceleration rates. However
crashes which necessitate repairs are inevitable and Audi claims that a
normal dealer bodyshop can perform 95% of all accident repair work and
only where the frame has been damaged does an ASF vehicle have to be
taken to a specialist bodyshop.

To date 20,000 of the A8 model have been built and the current
production rate is 60 to 70 cars per day. Looking ahead Audi knows that
it will get more savings in weight by using an aluminium monocoque, but
this will involve bonding sheets together. Work is continuing on this
and there may be something to report within the next three years.

Steel's potential for lightweighting

The rivalry between aluminium and steel as the major material for the
construction of cars, particularly car bodies, became apparent in the
presentation of the next paper, titled The ultra light steel auto body
, by

Mr E F Walker and Mr K Lowe of British Steel Strip Products. Mr Walker
said that the pattern of steel developments has demonstrated the steel
industry's response to the changing requirements of improved body
designs, greater durability and more recently the demands for weight
reduction to improve fuel consumption and air quality. Steel producers
have traditionally collaborated with their customers on a one-to-one
basis to develop the quality of their materials. This has contributed
to weight reduction mainly through agreements on the optimum grade and
gauge required after a detailed study of manufacturing and performance
demands of each part of the vehicle body. The development of high
strength steels has also contributed to vehicle weight reduction. Re-
phosphorised and bake-hardened steels can be used for body panels with
high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels and dual- phase steels for
underbody and structural parts.

While these developments do produce weight savings, something more
substantial is required. In the USA a 1993 study to evaluate the
potential for weight reduction reported that it was possible to reduce
the weight of a mid-size American car by nearly 64 kg, remove 50 parts
and lower variable manufacturing cost by $40. In early 1994, the world
s steel companies, including British Steel, formed a consortium to
pursue the next steps in vehicle weight reduction using steel. The
Ultra Light Steel Auto Body (ULSAB) project was launched in July 1994,
funded by 32 steel companies from 15 countries. The aim was to design
and build a lightweight efficient body structure which would be viable
for mass production and would meet a high level of functional and
structural performance. Mr Walker went on to describe the work on this
project to date and this is reported on page 18 in the article Steel
Threats and Responses .

The challenge from high modulus composites

A look into the future followed, with the presentation of the results
of research into the use of new materials and designs. The paper The
MOSAIC front structure in HMC a unique approach to lightweighting was
presented by Mr P Valersteinas of Renault and Mr J Penon and

Mr H E Rowlands of DSM Resins. MOSAIC Material Optimisation for a
Structural Automotive Innovative Concept was a European research
project (under the EUREKA programme) on materials for use in automobile
production. Masterminded by Renault, it brought together a car
manufacturer and raw material producers. MOSAIC led to two prototype
cars based on the Renault Clio, one made in steel and the other in a
hybrid structure of aluminium and composite material. Project time was
four years from 1991, and the budget FFr350 million. Partners in the
second prototype were Renault, Norsk Hydro for the aluminium space
frame, Enichem and Montecatini for the floor pan, DSM for the front
structure, and Ciba- Geigy for the bonding technology. The design
strategy was based on simultaneous engineering principles in that from
the concept stage designers, material technologists and process and
production specialists worked together on design development in close
co-operation with Renault.

DSM had to develop a new composite for the front end in order to meet
the performance criteria. It was Shimoco HMC (high modulus compound)
and consisted of vinyl ester thermosetting resin, mineral fillers,
reinforcing glass fibres and additives such as curing agent and
pigment. An additional bonus was that up to 10% of recycled HMC can be
used in the mix without any change in the properties of the final
product. In total, 25 complete front structures were made in this
material using full production equipment, and they passed testing for
fatigue, stiffness, ageing and crash by Renault. An industrial assembly
model has indicated that a fully assembled front structure can be
produced from the parts in 50 seconds. DSM concluded that HMC had been
validated as a structural material for cars in that it gives:

* lower manufacturing costs due to lean production (80 parts on the
standard Clio reduced to 9 with HMC);

* substantially lower investment costs;

* increased production flexibility from 50 to 2,000 cars per day can be
produced with a linear capital cost increase;

* weight reductions of 30% compared to steel (similar to aluminium).

DSM concluded that composites remain in the position of challenger to
traditional materials such as steel, which continues to be the
reference point in the car industry. This paper was interesting in that
it showed that composites can be used for the manufacture of the more
extensive parts of a car, and it highlighted once again that research
collaboration between a car manufacturer and raw material producers
across Europe can be beneficial to those concerned.

The aluminium monocoque

A further contribution on the use of aluminium came from Mr D J
Meadows, European Automotive Group, Alcan International Ltd in a paper
The aluminium monocoque BIW the facts, not fiction .

There are two options, the conventional stamped sheet monocoque (SSM)
which offers up to 50% weight saving compared to a spot welded steel
car, and the extruded space frame (ESF) which would give 30% to 40%
saving. Both have their advocates, the latter's advantages being that
tooling costs are claimed to be low and model changes can be effected
without major structural modification; but to the largest producers of
cars the former offers the greatest weight saving and the least change
from their current manufacturing practices and thus is more likely to
be chosen. Therefore, in order to maximise the weight savings of a SSM,
Alcan has developed a technology known as AVT which encompasses
materials, surfaces and joining methods that include adhesive bonding
and spot welding. AVT is based on the use of a pre-treated and pre-
lubricated material and bonding with an advanced heat curing epoxy
adhesive developed with Ciba-Geigy.

Alcan has worked with a number of motor manufacturers on an SSM BIW
which was fully motorised and subject to full vehicle structural
evaluation programmes, with creditable overall results. Motor cars have
been built on the SSM principle for many years and production
processes, manufacturing equipment and knowledge have been refined to
produce the lowest cost vehicles. Alcan decided to stick with this
route, recognising that for a manufacturer to change to building
aluminium ESFs would entail not only the use of a new material but also
rendering much of the existing manufacturing knowledge and equipment
redundant.

The relative merits of SSM and Clad ESF have been stated by Alcan as
shown in Table 1 overleaf.

Attention was drawn to Ford's increasing commitment to aluminium
following the Aluminium Intensive Vehicle. For model year 1997 the cab
of Ford's new truck will be made of adhesive bonded aluminium and will
weigh just 113 kg. There will also be over 100,000 bonnets and boots in
aluminium on Ford cars.

Already 5% of a car's weight is of aluminium mostly components and by
the year 2000 Alcan is predicting the production of the first monocoque
body (presumably for a mass produced car). By 2015 it expects about 15%
of a car to be of aluminium with increased use for both components and
skins.

Weldbonded steel performance

A growing interest in adhesives was demonstrated by a paper on High
impact performance weldbonded steel bodyshells by Mr R E Davis of Ford
Motor Co Ltd and Mr J H Powell of Ciba Polymers. Currently adhesives
are widely used in many applications on automotive body shells for
bonding closure panels, roofs, reinforcements and direct glazing, but
in highly demanding applications adhesive bonds make little
contribution to the overall impact energy absorption of the structure.
The design benefits of adhesives are improved joint stiffness and
fatigue resistance, design freedom and manufacturing flexibility. For
these to be obtained in other areas of the body structure adhesive
joints must be able to perform as well as spot welded joints when
subjected to impact, since most areas could be required to withstand
impact loads when the vehicle is in service.

New tests were developed which represent better what happens to parts
of the vehicle when subjected to impact, and these were used to
evaluate tougher stronger epoxy adhesives which had been developed in
parallel. The tests involve box beams which are representative of the
load carrying members of a steel monocoque bodyshell such as pillars,
crossmembers, sidemembers and also front ends. In the latter the box
beam type members of a bodyshell are constrained by large panels such
as the floor pan or inner wings and the ends are generally fixed to
other members when being crushed in a collision.

With the new stronger epoxy adhesive the tests proved to be
satisfactory. Spotwelded beams were also tested to provide the basis
for comparison. Coated steels (electrogalvanised, hot dip galvanised
and galvannealed) were also box beam tested. Both electrogalvanised and
hot dip galvanised steel beams behaved similarly to mild steel beams,
but galvannealed beams had worse performance. The potential for
comparison came from a study of the thickness of the steel used in the
tests. It was found that weldbonded beams were able to maintain a
higher average collapse force and less impact deformation across a
range of gauges compared to spotwelded beams. The results suggest that
some members could be reduced in weight by around 15%.

PSA's TULIP concept vehicle

The final paper of this session given by Mr P M Parrott of Automotive
Technology Ltd (representing PSA Peugeot-Citroen Group), was on The
TULIP concept vehicle . Since 1991 the PSA Peugeot-Citroen Group has
been developing more appropriate urban cars for example the electric
versions of both the Peugeot 106 and Citroen AX. What is now being
proposed is a medium term vision of urban transport giving individual
freedom to the general public. This new concept, called TULIP
(Transport Urbain, Libre, Individuel et Public), would put at the
disposal of a great many customers a compact two seater electric
vehicle.

The TULIP concept draws on development work carried out by PSA in
partnership with SORA Composites Group to produce a composite car body
with limits to the number of structural vehicle parts, the number of
materials used (initially from the range of composite materials) and
the manufacturing time. It was from these that the TULIP vehicle
emerged consisting of just five primary elements structurally bonded
together with an epoxy adhesive. Each of the five parts is comprised of
a rigid polyurethane foam core wrapped in a preformed glass fibre mat
which is then injected with polyester resin. The process is called
resin transfer moulding (RTM). The resultant assembly weighs about 33%
less than the equivalent steel structure. There is also an element of
recycling in the manufacture of the vehicle in that waste glass fibre
can be ground and used as a stiffener in the foam core, thereby
allowing a lower density foam to be used.

Light weight materials for brakes

The first paper in the chassis session was an Investigation of light
weight materials for brake rotor applications , and presented by Dr D
Grieve,

Dr D C Barton and Prof. D A Crolla of the Department of Engineering,
University of Leeds, Mr J D Buckingham, Rover Cars Ltd, and Mr J
Chapman, BBA Friction.

It is well known that during braking the kinetic energy of the moving
vehicle is converted into thermal energy. This thermal energy is stored
by the thermal mass of the brake rotor (currently cast iron) and
dissipation of this stored energy takes place by convection and
radiation from the free surfaces of the brake. Moreover the brake,
rotor and stator, must be capable of operating over a wide range of
temperatures ( 40 to 800oC) without the loss of structural integrity
and excessive thermal distortion. With two or four discs per vehicle,
each weighing between 3 kg and 5 kg, a significant saving can be
achieved by replacement of the conventional cast iron disc with a
lighter alternative.

The materials chosen for investigation were a high temperature steel, a
copper- nickel alloy and a variety of composites (aluminium-MMC,
magnesium-MMC, carbon-carbon and Salon 101) but prior to that a
functional analysis of the braking system was undertaken to determine
the direction and scope of the research. This involved three different
tests (cooling test, alpine descent and fade test) carried out on the
test vehicle (Rover 200) after which these results were compared with a
simulation using a finite element model. Once the model had been
validated it was used to examine a number of materials under the
conditions experienced in the three different tests. The effects of
disc thickness were also studied.

All materials except Al-MMC were found to have serious drawbacks.
However an Al-MMC disc brake had shortcomings in that it would require
both improved cooling and thicker cheeks to keep surface temperatures
below the quoted maximum and operating temperatures. It has to be
concluded that a more effective and lighter substitute for cast iron as
a brake rotor is still some way off.

Forging of MMCs

Still on the theme of brakes, there followed a scientific paper on
Forging of an MMC for an automotive component by Messrs A M de Sanctis,
E Evangelista and A Forcellese, Department of Mechanics, University of
Ancona, Italy, and Mr A Fuganti, Fiat Centre Research, Orbassano,
Italy. The paper described research on a lightweight alternative to the
cast iron brake drum.

It was estimated that a weight reduction of about 40% could be obtained
by substituting the grey cast iron with aluminium alloy matrix
composites. Frictional tests established that of the three aluminium
composites originally selected, alloy 2618 (aluminium containing 20% Al
2O3 ) was found to be the most attractive to replace cast iron.

A thermal analysis of the brake drum by the finite element method shows
that the good behaviour of the MMC brake drum was predictable, but
experimental tests on components involving repeated braking will be
necessary to verify that the maximum temperature reached on the rubbing
surface is below 400oC (at which severe wear takes place). Also the
temperature close to the wheel hub must be suitable for traditional
wheel bearing application of approximately 120oC continually and 180oC
maximum.

Forging trials and experimental analysis showed that a finished brake
drum satisfying the soundness requirement could be produced, but this
involved machining the critical part of the forging. This caused a
substantial increase in manufacturing cost due to the low machinability
of MMCs. It was concluded that a more accurate forging design and a
proper definition of the forging conditions are required for low cost
manufacturing of defect-free MMC brake drum components. It is worth
recording that this collaborative research work was part funded by the
EU as a BRITE-EURAM project and involved, besides the authors, an MMC
manufacturer, two forging companies, two universities and a research
centre in three EC countries.

Lighter weight for dynamic and structural components

A paper entitled A review of light weight components in dynamic and
structural applications by Mr P R J Addis and Mr D P J Rogers of Jaguar
Cars Engineering Centre discussed, with the aid of case studies,
potential means for developing reduced weight components. Traditional
materials used in structural applications in vehicle manufacturing
which fulfil quite adequately the requirements of strength, integrity,
durability and ease of manufacture are steels, cast iron and aluminium
casting alloys. But low mass options have emerged, and are continuing
to do so.

Aluminium and magnesium are being introduced widely for lower weight
components, but both suffer from lower stiffness compared with their
ferrous counterparts. This can be overcome by good practice in design
and manufacturing. Speculation is now mounting about the use of the
aerospace material titanium, now that sources of lower cost titanium
alloy powders and finished parts are becoming available from Eastern
Europe. Its use could be in reciprocating valve train and other engine
components.

Engineering polymers and composites, which are lighter than metals, are
available for use as structural components in a vehicle's semi-
structural engine components, and suspension tie rods are already
produced from these materials. In manufacturing, emphasis is focusing
on processes which as far as possible will give near net shape, and
enable complicated designs to be achieved with full integrity. Various
developments in the casting, forging and forming industries indicate
that this is possible.

The main obstacles to the introduction of lower weight components were
identified as increased cost and the availability of technology in
respect of potential new materials. However changes are taking place
and four case studies were cited which illustrated the use of new
materials for components and different manufacturing processes:

* Traditionally the crossbeam has been manufactured by welding sheet
steel pressings including brackets and mounting points for the engine
and the wishbones. Substantial corrosion protection is essential. Now
it is planned to replace the steel assembly with a single controlled
fill low pressure diecasting in an aluminium alloy that is fully heat
treatable and has high strength, low corrosion and good impact
properties. A reduction in weight of 10 12 kg, or about 65% of the
original weight, is achieved together with closer tolerances from the
near net shape and relatively simple assembly. However, costs are only
less than steel for lower volume applications.

* Forged alloy steel or high impact nodular cast iron are used for the
steering knuckle, which forms the link between the wishbones and the
steering rod, since it is subject to suspension and steering load in a
high temperature environment. For low volume vehicles, indirect squeeze
castings in aluminium alloys have been introduced with a weight saving
of 3 kg per component. It is expected that such components will be
fitted to high volume, mid-size vehicles in 1996.

* For rear wheel drive vehicles the drivetrain contributes a
substantial proportion of the gross weight of the vehicles. Its main
component is the propshaft, transmitting power from the gearbox to the
differential on the rear axle. Steel tubes have been universally used
for these driveshafts with forged steel yokes and joints welded into
the ends. A centre bearing, a requisite on some large vehicles, adds to
the weight. Under development is an extruded aluminium alloy tubular
shaft, if necessary wound with continuous carbon fibre for extra
stiffness and better load bearing capability. Yokes of forged or
squeeze cast aluminium alloy are welded into the tube. The lower mass
permits higher whirl speeds and removes the need for a centre bearing
and two part system on large vehicles. Weight savings of around 50% are
being estimated, however difficulties remain. The lightweight component
materials are more expensive (though this might be offset by ease of
assembly). The large diameter of the shaft may also present problems in
system packaging.

* A connecting rod reciprocates at high velocity whilst being subject
to high compressive and inertia forces. Space limitations have
traditionally restricted material choice to forged alloy steel and, for
some lower stress applications, nodular cast iron. Extensive machining
and balancing operations are the norm. Under development is a
sinterforged alloy steel connecting rod manufactured from powder. More
than 20% weight saving has been obtained compared with a forged part
for a similar application arising from the very high accuracy of the
process and the absence of a balancing requirement.

On being questioned, the authors said that none of the examples
described were in use in Jaguar cars.

Aluminium production technologies

In a detailed talk on Aluminium control arms in different production
technologies , Mr Karl-Heinz von Zengen of VAW Aluminium AG, Bonn,
Germany, showed that for the manufacture of any component there is no
general best solution, but for every demand there is a specific best
solution. He pointed out that traditionally a designer tried to solve a
problem by using well known solutions either from within the company or
from a competitor. By adopting this approach it was rare for mistakes
to occur but there was also a distinct lack of innovation.

Also, slavishly sticking to best mechanical or other properties to the
exclusion of all else ignored important realities of production and
cost.

Over the years much has changed. Through the introduction of
simultaneous engineering teams and quality function deployment, a more
precise definition of the development's goal is given and more
development work is put out to potential producers. The result is a
faster innovation cycle and the prospects of lower development costs.
The production routes which Mr Zengen covered were forging, extruding,
casting, rolling/drawing and welding and the example component was a
control arm.

Forging is the classical production technology for highly stressed
components especially in chassis applications. To make the component
cheap in production it is best to have a constant cross-section over
the whole length. Thicker local areas, for example for the housings of
ball pins or bearings, requires an additional and possibly expensive
dosing process of raw material. It is possible to produce ribs but at a
higher cost. Tooling costs are proportional to the number of parts
produced.

Extruding is the process to use for components with complicated but
constant cross-sections over large lengths. Typical applications are
roof and seat rails, and from Audi all window frames for movable
windows. In larger sections there are front and rear cross beams of
cars and side panels of heavy trucks. With extruding only, limited
three-dimensional shape is possible, integration of housing is
impossible and tooling is independent of the number of parts.

Casting dominates the use of aluminium in automotive applications with
a share of roughly 85%. Applications in the chassis area are typically
crossbeams for multi link axles, hollow wishbones and similar
components in low scale production cars. It is now possible to produce
aluminium castings with good ductility by a vacuum assisted high
pressure die casting technique. Control arms of multi link axles have
been manufactured by this method and are being used in the new Porsche
911 series.

Control arms can also be produced by rolling and deep drawing aluminium
sheet but there are drawbacks in that relatively high tooling costs
necessitate large daily and total production numbers, and the thin wall
thickness requires broad flanges and a large drawing depth which can
lead to package problems. VAW are currently developing a process to
manufacture control rods from a seam welded aluminium alloy tube with
ends flattened to form the flange and drilled for the bushes. In this
process limited three dimensionality is possible by bending. There is a
high stiffness to weight ratio and tool costs depend upon the number of
parts.

In conclusion there was a stark reminder that even if the geometric
conditions for the five different technologies are identical, the
behaviour of the part in these different technologies is different.

Magnesium diecastings

Continuing the light metal theme was a paper on Magnesium diecastings
in automotive body/chassis applications by Mr P D Caton of Diemakers
Ltd, Slough, UK, and Mr K Barnes of Diemakers Inc, Monroe City, USA.

Mr Caton said that while magnesium diecastings have a higher strength
to weight ratio than aluminium diecastings or car body steel most
European vehicles currently contain very little or no magnesium.
Against this, American vehicles now contain an average of around 3 kg
per vehicle and this figure is rising significantly. It was the need
for weight reductions to meet the CAFE regulations which stimulated
North American engineers to look wider for their choice of materials.
The use of magnesium in diecasting in the USA has risen from 4,000
tonnes in 1982 to 16,000 tonnes in 1990, and dramatically to an
estimated 40,000 tonnes in 1995. By contrast European usage reached a
peak of 20,000 tonnes in 1984, declined by about half by 1988, but is
expected to reach 11,000 tonnes in 1995 on a clear upward trend.

In 1982 magnesium diecastings were used by Ford for the brake and
clutch pedal support brackets on its pickup trucks with a saving of 1.7
kg on a component which weighed 2.3 kg in steel. Now it is extensively
used in this capacity by both Ford and Chrysler. By the 1990s Ford were
using diecastings for more demanding applications in the form of the
main actuator housing and key-lock housing in the steering column
assembly.

The principal reason for considering the use of magnesium is usually
weight reduction. However, less well known properties of magnesium, for
example low heat content and low reactivity to steel, result in higher
productivity and longer die lives when compared with aluminium
diecastings. Moreover the good fluidity of molten magnesium permits the
casting of complex components containing fine details. The low heat
content reduces the amount of thermal distortion, enabling close
tolerances to be met with the possibility of avoiding a secondary
machining operation. Another attractive property is magnesium's high
damping capacity which makes diecastings suitable for engine components
such as valve covers (as specified by Ford, BMW, Toyota and Mercedes-
Benz) and for the steering wheel core. Other applications which are now
receiving attention in the USA and Europe are the integrated dash panel
or car cross-beam, and the prototype development of using diecasting
for door frames and boot lids as means of saving considerable weight. A
diecast magnesium dash panel was used by Audi to introduce airbags for
the V8 model, and General Motors has plans for widespread use of this
design principle. Besides weight saving from using a one piece
magnesium diecasting, there are additional benefits from a reduction in
sub-component diversity and assembly costs, and the exploitation of
magnesium's high damping capacity to absorb noise and vibrations
emanating from the steering column.

But not everything is going well for magnesium and its diecasters. The
price of magnesium in 1995 is up 15% on that in 1994, and there is a
problem obtaining supplies. Mr Caton claimed that this was a result of
poor forecasting of demand about three years ago which prompted the
closure of two production plants. However, two big plants, in Australia
and Israel, are coming on stream in about a year and the prediction is
that the price of magnesium should return to its 1994 level.

Plastic pedals

A paper on an even lighter material, plastic, ended the session.
Presented by Mr I S Rendell, Deputy Managing Director of Birkby
Plastics Ltd, it was titled Light weight plastic pedals . He said that
traditionally pedals have been produced by stamping quite heavy gauged
metal sheet or using steel or aluminium rods. After which extensive
welding, machining, assembly and protective coating were required, all
of which added to the cost. Now the space limitation in the footwell
area has further complicated the design of the pedals and pedal box
assembly, inhibiting the use of metals. This, plus the requirements for
weight and cost reductions, led to the use of injection moulded plastic
parts. These can be of complex designs with integrated functions and
are produced in a single operation. Plastics have achieved a 30% to 60%
reduction in weight at reduced cost.

Worldwide, about 80 million accelerator and brake pedals and about 60
million clutch pedals are produced each year. Europe has been changing
to plastic pedals in the past 10 years; similar movement in the USA
occurred much later. Birkby started to supply Ford with plastic
accelerator pedals for its Fiesta in 1988; the pedal weighed 120
grammes compared with the steel version's 256 grammes; the pedal on the
1995 Fiesta weighs only 100 grammes. Most European car manufacturers
now fit plastic accelerator pedals into their vehicles. However the
term plastic does not do justice to the material or its function; it is
actually a plastic composite consisting of nylon and a filler of 40%
short glass fibres.

Car manufacturers such as VW, BMW, Fiat and Ford are also introducing
plastic clutch pedals on their latest models. The performance
requirement of a clutch pedal is far more severe than that of an
accelerator pedal. Clutch pedals normally operate at a force of 100 to
150 Newtons, two to three times that of accelerators at 40 to 60
Newtons. The weight saving is dramatic; metal clutch pedals weigh 480
to 630 grammes and plastic ones 220 to 250 grammes. Next it will be the
turn of the brake pedal it is thought that Fiat could be the first
manufacturer to launch it.

In fact it is logical to make the whole pedal box assembly in plastic
as Fiat is already doing with the Fiat Ducato system. There are over 50
parts in the average metal pedal box assembly whereas the Fiat system
has less than half that number. In metal it weighs nearly 6 kg and in
plastic only 2.7 kg. There is also a reputed 20% cost saving.

The second part of this conference report, covering the joining and
forming and under bonnet topics, will appear in the February 1996 issue
of AEA.

STEEL THREATS AND RESPONSES

The ULSAB project

News that 32 of the world's steel companies from 15 countries had
formed a consortium to fund the Ultra Light Steel Auto Body (ULSAB)
project was remarkable (see CONFERENCE REPORT 1, page 12), and Phase 1
has already been completed. Steel is a highly competitive business with
some companies state owned or state subsidised, so such collaboration
is rare.

It is interesting to speculate on what prompted this move. Two reasons
are high on the list: cars have to be made lighter to help to improve
fuel consumption and meet emission regulations, but there is also an
increasingly serious threat from aluminium as a material for car
bodies. The production of the Audi A8 and Ford's fleet of 40 Aluminium
Intensive Vehicles for testing around the world are prime examples of
the potential threat to steel's market domination. The stakes are high.
This year alone an estimated 38 million cars will be produced worldwide
and, after allowing for the aluminium share, about 10 million tonnes of
steel sheet will have been consumed in the manufacture of bodies-in-
white (BIW). On top of this there is the amount that goes into
commercial vehicles. It is in the interests of all auto sheet producers
that such a huge market be defended. Collaboration on a project to
produce lightweight car bodies therefore makes good sense. It is also
good for the environment.

The ULSAB project was launched in July 1994 with the aim of designing
and building a lightweight efficient body structure which is viable for
mass production and will meet a high level of functional and structural
performance. The consortium commissioned Porsche Engineering Services
in Troy, Michigan, USA, to carry out the project in three phases:

1. Concept phase: this entailed the concept design, engineering and
analysis by Porsche Engineering of a five-seater, medium to large
saloon car.

2. Feasibility phase: this involves detail design, engineering and
analysis, building body demonstration hardware and basic BIW testing.

3. Exploitation phase: this will be the exploitation of the newly
proven opportunities for cost effective weight reduction in vehicle
design and building programmes.

In the analysis of Phase 1, a reference vehicle package was defined
from a study of nine North American, European and Japanese cars which
covered mass, static bending, static torsion, and first BIW vibration
mode. Following this, future reference values were calculated for each
performance parameter, since the ULSAB design will have to compete with
future vehicles. Also included in the study were nine different steels
all currently available to the automotive industry worldwide, nine
product parameters and twelve manufacturing processes all in current
use or capable of immediate implementation. Starting with a projected
vehicle package Porsche Engineering had a free hand in the design of
the ULSAB.

Design concept

Phase 1 has produced a design concept that demonstrates the interaction
between materials and processes. This design concept makes use of
various sheet steels, including high strength, bake hardening and dual
phase types (two thirds of the steels are high strength). Each steel is
matched to appropriate forming processes: deep drawing, roll forming,
hydroforming (5 parts are hydroformed) and tailored blanking (20 out of
78 major parts are tailor blanked). The appropriate joining techniques
such as spot welding, arc welding, laser welding, weld bonding and
mechanical joining are then applied.

Mass production

Considerable attention has been paid to ensuring the viability of the
ULSAB design for mass production. The sequence of assembly operations
for the front structure, underbody, body sides and final assembly have
been detailed. In the framing stages the exterior panels were excluded
in order to provide clearance to welds without access holes because
having large holes for weld gun clearance next to certain joints proved
unacceptable. A mainly conventional overall assembly concept emerged
with an inside-out build sequence being used on a conventional
platform. No major problems are anticipated in producing different body
styles.

Crash analysis

For Phase 1 crash simulation the computer-modelled BIW was fitted with
a bumper system, suspension, fuel tank, doors and a powertrain. The
crash analysis generally adopted a conservative approach. The front and
rear end simulations were performed at 35 mph (56 km/h), exceeding the
30 mph (48 km/h) standard. The 50 km/h side impact analysis was based
on a European side moving barrier test, but with a rigid barrier in
place of the standard deformable one. Porsche Engineering also
confirmed the protection of occupants in roll over crashes.

Performance summary

Based on available vehicle data (benchmark references), the average
body weight of a typical mid-sized saloon was fixed at 271 kg. This
typically represents 20% to 25% of the total vehicle weight. The ULSAB
weighs 205 kg with the same wheelbase, higher torsion and higher
bending rigidity. Body weight can therefore be reduced by up to 35%.
But there is more. The prospect of beginning with a lighter BIW offers
ample opportunity for additional weight reduction in powertrain,
suspension system, wheels and other components. Calculations put these
savings at about 50 kg. Lower fuel consumption, lower emissions and
reduced environmental impacts result from this lighter, more efficient
package.

Using a technical cost modelling (TCM) methodology IBIS Associates, an
independent automotive cost research company in the US, carried out a
costing of alternative designs. It showed that the current conventional
design reference BIW would contain 195 pieces and cost $1,116, and that
the ULSAB BIW would contain 169 pieces and cost $962, a saving of about
14%. This saving arises from a combination of more innovative design,
fewer parts and more efficient manufacture.

Benefits

The advantages from weight saving in steel include the following:

* steel-based weight saving designs and manufacturing technologies can
be implemented quickly because the basic manufacturing structure
already exists;

* this in turn means less risk and lower investment, material and
manufacturing costs for car makers; by contrast the use of alternative
materials such as aluminium requires greater investment in terms of
time and money;

* environmentally the benefits of vehicle weight savings accrue
quickly;

* it is claimed by the steel industry that steel exhibits overall
environmental life cycle advantages: cited are its superior and
demonstrable recyclability and a lower impact in the production process
through lower energy consumption, re- usable solid wastes and a smaller
volume of greenhouse gas emissions.

The future

In Phase 2 of the USLAB study, the steel industry consortium is
investing $20m over the next 24 months to construct demonstration
bodies to verify the design for weight, the ability to manufacture,
rigidity and other performance criteria. The evidence confirms that the
world steel industry is taking a serious approach to the threat from
aluminium, and seems intent on nipping this in the bud.

AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

The conference Effective Local Air Quality Management was held on 29
November 1995 in London and was sponsored by Local Transport Today. The
90 delegates were mostly from local authorities but included
representatives from transport operators, vehicle manufacturers and the
oil industry.

The conference was convened to assist with the development of an
effective transport policy response to the new responsibilities of
local authorities detailed in the 1995 Environment Act. Quite simply,
this Act involves the government handing down to local councils new
duties for ensuring that vehicle emissions do not reach levels which
pose a threat to public health.

This conference report focuses on the papers of greatest interest to
AEA readers and is not intended to be a complete record of the
proceedings.

Air pollution and health not a crisis, but action is needed

Dr Malcolm Green (President, British Lung Foundation) emphasised that
the health effects of the different pollutants that make up air
pollution are often complex and difficult to disentangle. For instance,
severe episodes of nitrogen dioxide pollution seem to be associated
with small increases in mortality, but clinical studies on the effects
of nitrogen dioxide have so far been equivocal. Similarly, despite the
much publicised connection between asthma and air pollution, there is
only anecdotal evidence to support the link.

In contrast, though, numerous studies have found that high levels of
ozone exacerbate respiratory problems. Perhaps of greater significance
for vehicle manufacturers, recent studies of the effects of
particulates seem to have effectively confirmed that diesel engines are
no more environmentally friendly than petrol engines.

Despite the lack of clear-cut evidence, there is now widespread
acceptance that air pollution is an important health issue. There are
no easy solutions to the problems but it now seems apparent that
continuing unrestricted expansion in our use of private cars is not
sustainable. There is a clear need for a rational transport policy.

In conclusion, Dr Green emphasised that while air pollution is a cause
for concern and requires action, it is not causing a health crisis at
present.

UK government strategy for improving air quality

James Clappison (Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the
Environment) outlined the government's policies for improving air
quality.

In March 1994, the government published a consultative document,
Improving Air Quality, which set out wide-ranging proposals on how the
challenge should be met. Subsequently, the government's policies for
air quality management were defined in Air Quality: Meeting the
Challenge. The policies detailed in this document were incorporated
into the Environment Act 1995 and will be used to meet the standards
and targets as due to be defined by the government in December 1995.
Guidance for local authorities on assessing and managing air quality
will also be issued.

The policies of the government can be divided into three main areas:

National air quality standards and targets: new standards and targets
will be established for nine individual pollutants (benzene, ozone, 1,3-
butadiene, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, particulates, nitrogen
oxides, lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). Some of these have
already been defined and published during 1995.

The standards adopted reflect the advice of the government's Expert
Panel on Air Quality Standards and are broadly in line with the latest
work of the European Union and the World Health Organisation. It is the
government's objective that these air quality targets should be
realised throughout the UK by the year 2005. Local authorities are
being given new powers and duties to establish plans for delivering the
targets.

Air quality management areas: a new framework for local air quality
management will be introduced that places powers and obligations on
local authorities to deal with areas that do not meet air quality
standards (air quality management areas).

Effective control of vehicle emissions: better air quality depends
above all on improvements to the transport sector. The five main themes
of the approach to this problem are:

* new standards for technology, emissions and fuels;

* planning policies and local transport strategies aimed at reducing
the need to travel and encouraging use of less polluting modes of
transport;

* new environmental responsibilities in partnership with public service
and other fleet operators;

* tighter enforcement of emissions regulations, targeting those
vehicles doing most damage to the environment;

* voluntary action and guidance.

Role of local authorities

Dr Tom Crossett (Secretary General, National Society for Clean Air and
Environmental Protection) considered the role of local authorities in
ensuring effective air quality management in light of the Environment
Act 1995.

So far, of the nine pollutants for which standards will be set, details
have been published for benzene, ozone, NOx, SOx and particulates. Of
these, meeting air quality standards for particulates will present the
greatest challenge for local authorities.

The new approach will place responsibilities on local authorities :

* to review air quality and assess against standards and objectives;

* where standards are not being met, the local authority must designate
an air quality management area (AQMA): they must then produce an action
plan proposing how they will tackle the problems in the AQMA;

* the measures at their disposal will include emissions testing
programmes, restricting vehicle access and other traffic management
schemes.

While welcoming the government's initiative, Dr Crossett expressed his
opinion that it was impossible to assess the practicality of the new
approach until the strategy is published, regulations and guidance
begin to emerge and the EU's Ambient Air Quality Assessment and
Management Directive becomes embodied into UK law.

If the policies so far outlined are to be successful in the UK, the
following areas will be important:

* adequate resources;

* the robustness of standards and their application;

* identification of least cost solutions; and

* management of cross boundary and inter-agency issues in pursuit of
cost effectiveness.

Policy options available

Gordon Henderson and Dr Neil Jenkins (Arup Transportation) examined in
detail the possible policy options for improving air quality.

The importance of vehicle speed/flow in determining emission rates is
well understood. In general, traffic conditions around the optimal
speed of 40 70 km/h (25 45 mph) produce the lowest emissions. At speeds
greater than 70 km/h, emissions tend to increase, particularly for
nitrogen oxides. However, the greatest impact occurs below 20 km/h (12
mph), where the highest emissions are normally associated with slow
moving traffic, stop/start conditions and queuing. Reducing emissions
from traffic can therefore be achieved by:

* reducing traffic congestion and promoting free flowing traffic;

* encouraging shorter trip distances; and

* reducing the number of trips.

Although these factors influence emissions, poor air quality actually
occurs in specific locations under certain meteorological conditions,
when local emissions accumulate and persist.

Short-term options to reduce emissions

Fines for highly polluting vehicles: the Environment Act 1995 allows
schemes to be introduced that levy fines on owners of polluting
vehicles. As an example of the success of such schemes, Singapore
ensures a high level of compliance with exhaust emissions by using
mobile police officers and smoke test teams to patrol the roads daily,
fining or prosecuting where necessary.

Temporary road closures and traffic bans: powers to restrict vehicle
access or impose temporary road closures are also included in the
Environment Act 1995. Clearly, care must be taken to ensure that
temporary bans do not simply transfer the problems elsewhere on the
road network.

Traffic management schemes: urban traffic control (UTC) schemes can be
used to smooth the traffic flow, thereby reducing fuel consumption and
emissions.

A recent report cited a study undertaken in Copenhagen in which the
effect of introducing green waves to allow smooth driving at around 40
km/h (25 mph) was modelled. It was estimated that such a scheme would
reduce emissions of CO and HCs by between 25% and 35% during the peak
hour and 20% over the duration of an entire weekday. Peak hour NOx
emissions would be reduced by between 10% and 25%. Although these
emissions benefits are significant, the study highlighted that this
freeing up of congestion could ultimately attract more traffic, thereby
recreating the problem.

Pilot red routes in London (that allow no parking or waiting) have been
shown to reduce the average journey time by around 15%. However, the
potential of such measures to attract more traffic was also
demonstrated by the accompanying increase of around 8% in the vehicle
flow. Despite this, a net emissions reduction was still achieved on the
routes, of between 1% and 17% for the different pollutants.

Although evidence is limited, research on traffic calming seems to show
that the implementation of 30 km/h speed limits and zones incorporating
physical traffic calming measures usually reduces emissions of nitrogen
oxides. The effects of traffic calming on fuel consumption and
emissions of CO, HC and CO2 remain less certain and some research
suggests that emissions of these pollutants are increased. These
results are not entirely surprising as traffic calming reduces traffic
speeds by interrupting the flow of traffic: this induces a greater
degree of acceleration and deceleration, a type of driving associated
with higher emissions. To achieve a general reduction in emissions,
therefore, traffic calming schemes should aim to reduce speeds whilst
also encouraging smooth driving behaviour.

Medium/long-term options to reduce emissions

Increasing attractiveness of alternative modes public transport:
improvements to public transport, either by the introduction of new
systems or improvements to existing systems, can induce modal transfer
and reduce the level of traffic in urban areas. The growth of light
rail schemes is testament to the efforts being made in this area.
However, the evidence so far shows that most of the people using
systems such as the Manchester Metrolink have simply transferred from
existing bus and rail services. Clearly, the effect on air quality will
remain very limited if public transport fails to attract car drivers
out of their vehicles. Further analysis of the Manchester system showed
the importance of parking commuters who had to pay for their parking
space were twice as likely to switch to Metrolink as those who had a
free space.

Guided busways are seen as perhaps a more cost effective alternative to
light rail in certain circumstances. Bus priority measures in general
can reduce congestion and produce substantial changes in bus emissions
(Figure 1).

The benefits of park and ride schemes are as yet unproven. A study of
Nottingham, Maidstone, Norwich and Shrewsbury indicated that park and
ride could prompt additional car trips as well as encouraging drivers
to travel further distances. Oxford has the largest park and ride
system in the UK and, despite its success, the city has experienced a
gradual decline in environmental conditions. A new #18m strategy in the
city, which includes further measures to encourage transfer from cars
to public transport and restrictions on car parking in the central
area, is being implemented.

Increasing attractiveness of alternative modes walking and cycling:
policies which encourage walking and cycling tend to be given a high
priority by most local authorities seeking to develop sustainable
transport policies.

York provides a good example of the potential of pedestrianisation as
an extensive scheme was introduced in 1987, covering more than 30
streets. Outside the city centre, complementary traffic calming schemes
have done much to improve conditions for pedestrians by slowing down
and reducing through traffic.

High quality cycle routes are also important if cycling is to be
encouraged and the #42.5m award to Sustrans to build a national network
of cycle routes is a welcome development. The use of bicycles to
replace short distance trips by cars is especially important because of
the high levels of emissions associated with such trips and the effects
of cold starts.

Car restraint policies parking: parking controls can be applied by
limiting the number of spaces available, the duration permitted, the
type of vehicle allowed and the price charged. The political
sensitivity of parking measures is great and there exist concerns over
the effects of restrictions on the livelihood of city centres. Also,
the impacts of any parking measures are often diluted by the
predominance of private non-residential parking spaces which are
unaffected by policy initiatives.

Theoretical studies indicate that parking charges can be one of the
most effective means of discouraging car use a Transport Research
Laboratory study concluded that doubling parking charges would reduce
the car's share of commuting in the central areas of towns by about
13%. Interestingly, it was noted that this doubling of car parking
charges would have a greater effect in reducing vehicle emissions than
a halving of public transport fares.

Car restraint policies area bans: heavily polluted cities in mainland
Europe often employ area bans in an attempt to reduce the winter air
quality problems. The evidence from cities such as Athens, Madrid and
Milan suggests that area bans can have a dramatic effect on traffic
levels and vehicle emissions within the banned area. Areas on the
periphery of the ban, however, may experience a deterioration in their
environment and unless the ban is very extensive, overall citywide
emissions reductions are likely to be small.

Car restraint policies central area licensing/road pricing: fiscal
measures such as central area licensing/road pricing are designed to
alter the relative costs of alternative transport modes. It follows
from this that if they are to fulfil their objectives, they must be
supported by a comprehensive package of measures including investment
in new and improved public transport systems.

Perhaps the most interesting projections of the impacts of road pricing
have been developed within the London Congestion Research Programme.
This study indicated that imposing a high charge level (#8 all day for
the central cordon; #4 for Inner London) would produce significant
changes in emissions (Figure 2). Further reductions beyond those shown
in Figure 2 would result if the charging measures were accompanied by
investment in public transport infrastructure and service improvements.

The widely publicised system of area licensing employed in Singapore is
estimated to reduce daily air pollution by around 10% with greater
reductions in the morning-peak emissions of around 30%. Potential
problems of area licensing are illustrated by the increased congestion
and pollution on the ring road, outside the central area. The full
benefits of area licensing schemes can only be realised if improvements
to alternative modes of travel are introduced in parallel. It follows
that allocation of road pricing revenue to fund complementary public
transport improvements is very important.

Planning policies: Planning Policy Guidance Note 13 (PPG 13), published
in March 1994, introduced a major change in UK policy with increased
emphasis on the inter- relationship of land use planning and
transportation as a means of:

* reducing the growth in length and number of motorised journeys;

* encouraging alternative means of travel which have less environmental
impact; and hence

* reducing reliance on the private car.

In essence, PPG 13 is intended to encourage car-borne shoppers back to
the city centre by moving employment and retail centres back into urban
and suburban areas. However, as shown by the recent RAC report (last
month's AEA), there is considerable debate over whether such policies
can reduce overall vehicle mileage and address the wider emissions
issues.

The speakers recommended that more practical research be carried out
into options to reduce vehicle emissions to complement the existing
theoretical work. They laid emphasis upon improvements in vehicle
technology as playing a major, if not dominant role, in reducing
traffic-related pollutants in the foreseeable

future. The principal components in the technological approach will be
catalytic converters, particulate traps, improved engine efficiency and
the introduction of cleaner fuels.

Sustainable planning policies must be reinforced by a firm commitment
to facilitate and fund high quality, attractive alternatives to the car
and an acceptance of the need to implement restraint measures
deliberately to discourage car use.

Air pollution information

Joy Thompson (Planning and Environment Department, Westminster City
Council) covered the role of local government in providing information
to the public about air pollution.

The Westminster campaign has targeted two groups: air pollution
sufferers, and polluters. Sufferers need to be informed when air
quality is going to be poor, and drivers need to know about the
condition of their vehicle and how much it is adding to pollution
levels.

Sufferers air quality information strategy: for most people, the
information of greatest use is when air quality is predicted to be poor
along with what action they can take to protect themselves. Rather than
publicise this information in libraries and other public places,
Westminster developed a more focused approach to communicating with
people who suffered during air pollution episodes. A network of key
contact points was established, consisting of schools, pharmacists,
general practitioners and hospital accident and emergency units. A
computerised system is now used whereby pollution warnings are
automatically faxed to the participants in the network when poor air
quality is ongoing or predicted. A telephone help line is also used so
that sufferers have direct access to pollution warnings.

Polluters Westminster's Exhaust Watch: there are two activities
involved in Exhaust Watch:

* the spotter campaign this encourages members of the public to report
vehicles with smoky exhausts. The information is then passed on to the
appropriate authority London Buses, the Public Carriage Office or the
Vehicle Inspectorate;

* roadside testing police stop the vehicle and a test is run on exhaust
emissions. The driver is given a printout of the results, advice on
what to do to solve any problems, and an information pack.

The problems of how information is communicated are being addressed by
an EU project, Efficiency of Information Campaigns in European
Municipalities which is looking at how air quality information is given
in different European cities, including Paris, Athens, Barcelona and
Westminster.

PUZZLING BUDGET

The recent fuel duty changes made in the UK budget leave some glaring
inconsistencies with regard to the treatment of diesel fuels.

The good news was that environmental considerations were used to
justify the reduction of duty on natural gas and liquefied petroleum
gas and the raising of duty on super unleaded fuel. Further, as part of
the programme to stabilise CO2 emissions, duties on transport fuels
continue to be increased by 5% above the rate of inflation.

Against this backdrop of environmentally-based fuel duties, the
treatment of diesel fuel appears rather incongruous. It is true that
the environmental problems of particulates from diesel fuel per se have
not been conclusively proven yet. With the jury still out it is perhaps
understandable that the Chancellor did not bend to pressure to increase
the duty on diesel fuel above that on petrol.

However, what is less comprehensible is why no differential was
introduced between conventional diesel fuel and low sulphur city diesel
emissions are reduced by 40%. Sainsbury's currently subsidises its
sales of city diesel so that it costs only 2p per litre more than
standard diesel. However, the growth of clean diesel should not rest on
a supermarket's public relations policy and if clean fuels really are
to be encouraged, duties must be reduced. If it is good enough for
petrol, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas then why not diesel?

SOAP STORY

The story of GM's polluting Cadillacs (NEWS ANALYSIS) reads like an
episode of a soap opera, complete with neatly highlighted moral
message.

To begin with, let us examine the polluting nature of these vehicles.
Routine testing found that the engines emitted up to three times the
permitted level of carbon monoxide with climate control on. In simple,
moral terms this can be seen as: in trying so hard to meet the
temperature and comfort requirements of those inside the vehicle, GM
failed to care adequately for those on the outside.

So, with the transgression discovered and the villain of the piece
cast, it was time for a tidy demonstration of the polluter pays
principle. These are troubled times for the EPA and one can almost hear
them rubbing their hands with glee at this straightforward
environmental wrongdoing. Not only must GM pay a fine, recall and refit
the sub-standard vehicles sold, but they must do good and spend another
$9m repairing the damage.

As the sun sets on the story, General Motors is continuing to growl and
splutter that they have been unfairly cast as environmental criminals.
Certainly, the tale seems too simple and in the final stages, the EPA
did appear to abandon negotiation and use the case as a public platform
on which to flex their muscles. This decision may yet backfire if the
net result is that the relationship between car manufacturers and the
EPA has been further tarnished.
