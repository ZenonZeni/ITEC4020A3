pathogens</b>. Journal of the International Hemp Association 1:
6-9.</p>

<p> The effect of the cultivation of fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa
L.), cv Kompolti Hibrid TC, on the population dynamics of the
soil-borne pathogens <i>Verticillium dahliae</i> (Fungi), <i>Meloidogyne
chitwoodi</i> and <i>Pratylenchus penetrans</i> (Nematoda) was
studied in greenhouse and field experiments. Fibre hemp
suppressed the population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> strongly. A
reduction in population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was also noted.
Removal of stubble of hemp from soil after harvest was found to
inhibit formation of survival structures (microsclerotia) of <i>V.
dahliae</i>.</font> </p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Introduction</b></font></p>

<p> Dutch agriculture faces an increasing problem with soil-borne
pathogens (including nematodes) due to intensive growing of a
limited number of crops in short rotations. Government plans to
reduce the use of soil disinfectants by 50 % by the next century
may well aggravate the situation. A possible solution to the
problem is the introduction of new crops in the rotation.</p>

<p> It is generally assumed that long rotations are less
susceptible to soil-borne diseases than short rotations. However,
this assumption may not apply to soil-borne pathogens with a wide
host range (polyphagous pathogens). Several fungi (e.g. <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i> and <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i>) and nematodes (e.g. <i>Pratylenchus</i>
spp. and <i>Meloidogyne</i> spp.) have a very large number of
host plants. Introduction of new crops of unknown host status
into a rotation may cause or aggravate problems with these
pathogens. Therefore, the population dynamics of important
polyphagous pathogens on new crops must be assessed before a safe
introduction can be made.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp is one of the potential new crops under
investigation in the Netherlands. Even though hemp is an ancient
crop, there are few reports on soil-borne diseases in this crop
and the general impression is that cultivation of hemp poses few
problems with plant diseases (Termorshuizen 1991). Soil-borne
diseases however often remain undetected due to the inconspicuous
symptoms. Furthermore, the absence of damage in a host plant does
not mean that the pathogen cannot multiply on the host.
Therefore, the population dynamics of some important soil-borne
pathogens on hemp were investigated.</p>

<p> The pathogens selected in this study were the fungus <i>Verticillium
dahliae</i> and the nematodes <i>Meloidogyne chitwoodi</i> and <i>Pratylenchus
penetrans</i>. These pathogens are potentially very harmful to
potato, which is the major crop in arable farming in the
Netherlands. <i>V. dahliae</i> is a major factor in the early
dying syndrome in potato, which can lead to severe yield
reduction. This pathogen has extremely persistent survival
structures (microsclerotia), that can endure in soil for over 12
years. Control of this pathogen is therefore very difficult
(Heale 1988).</p>

<p> The Columbian root-knot nematode <i>M. chitwoodi</i> has a
wide host range including many representatives of the <i>Gramineae</i>,
which are commonly used in rotational programmes with potatoes
(Santo et al. 1980). Low population levels of <i>M. chitwoodi</i>
already cause major crop losses of potato because of reduced
tuber quality and heavy infestations can substantially decrease
yields. Tuber infestation by <i>M. chitwoodi</i> causes necrotic
areas and other blemishes, rendering the tuber unsaleable
(Viglierchio 1987).</p>

<p> <i>P. penetrans</i>, the root-lesion nematode, has an
extremely wide host range. This species can cause severe growth
reduction and yield loss in potato production (Mai et al. 1977,
Santo 1989). Furthermore, <i>P. penetrans</i> increases the
effect of <i>V. dahliae</i> in the early dying syndrome of potato
(Kotcon et al. 1985, Rowe et al. 1985).</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Materials and Methods</b></font></p>

<p> The investigations described in this paper were carried out
using the Hungarian fibre hemp cultivar Kompolti Hibrid TC. This
cultivar was chosen for its good agricultural properties and
prior use as a standard in a cluster of research projects on
fibre hemp as an arable crop for paper production in the
Netherlands (&quot;National Hemp Programme&quot;).</p>

<p> The effect of cultivation of fibre hemp on the selected
pathogens was assessed by comparing the population before sowing
and after harvest of the crop. <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and <i>V.
dahliae</i> were studied in field and greenhouse experiments. The
reproduction of <i>P. penetrans</i> on hemp was studied in the
greenhouse only. The effect of fibre hemp on changes in
population of the pathogens was compared with the effect of crops
with known host status.</p>

<p> The greenhouse experiment with <i>V. dahliae</i> was carried
out using a organic sandy soil to which microsclerotia of <i>V.
dahliae</i> were added (2,500/ml soil). In 400 ml pots, hemp,
wheat and pea were grown (5 pots per treatment). A control
treatment contained no plants (fallow). Wheat and pea are
resistant and susceptible, respectively, to <i>V. dahliae</i>.
Afterwards, above-ground parts of the plants were removed and the
population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was estimated.</p>

<p> The population of <i>V. dahliae</i> was assessed with a
bioassay, using the potato as test plant. Rooted potato cuttings
were planted in 400 ml pots containing the soil to be tested. The
pots were placed on a greenhouse bench at 19 °C and watered
sparingly. At two to three days intervals, the number of leaves
showing wilt symptoms was determined. The disease progress was
monitored until the first potato plants died (60 days after
planting). The cumulative disease score was calculated per plant
and taken as the measure of the soil population of <i>V. dahliae</i>.</p>

<p> Formation of microsclerotia on crop residues of fibre hemp
such as plant tops and stubble was studied in some detail. Since
microsclerotia were very rarely observed on plant parts that were
vital (green) at harvest, the effect of pulling stubble directly
after harvest on the formation of microsclerotia was determined.
In a field infested with <i>V. dahliae</i>, plant tops were
collected and green stubble was removed from the soil after
harvest. Three weeks later, when the stubble had died, another
batch of stubble was collected in the field. On both occasions,
the plant material was left to dry on top of moist soil in a
greenhouse, to simulate drying in the field. Once they were
air-dried, the number of stubbles containing microsclerotia was
assessed.</p>

<p> The reproduction of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> on hemp was studied
in a greenhouse and in the field. In the greenhouse experiment
reproduction of the nematode was determined after 1 generation.
Three week old hemp seedlings were inoculated with 200, 400, 800,
1,600 or 3,200 nematodes (hatched second-stage juveniles) in 400
ml pots in 5 replications. After 1 generation cycle of the
nematodes (7 weeks at 20 °C), the number of newly formed eggs on
the roots was determined by the method of Vrain (1977). The
susceptibility of hemp was also tested in the field. On a sandy
soil heavily infested with <i>M. chitwoodi</i> (mean population
1500 eggs+larvae per 100 ml soil) fibre hemp was compared to five
other crops. All crops were grown in 6 x 6 m plots. Before sowing
and after harvest of the plants, the centre of the plot (1 x 1.5
m) was sampled with an auger (100 random samples, in total ± 3
litre soil per plot). The population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> was
determined with an Oostenbrink elutriator ('s Jacob and van
Bezooijen 1984). The experiment was set up as a randomized block
design with 4 replications.</p>

<p> The reproduction of <i>P. penetrans</i> on fibre hemp and,
for comparison, sugar beet (<i>Beta vulgaris</i> L.) or
fiddleneck (<i>Phacelia tanacetifolia</i> Benth.) was determined
in a greenhouse experiment. <i>P. tanacetifolia</i> and sugar
beet are susceptible and resistant, respectively, to <i>P.
penetrans</i>. The test plants were grown in 400 ml pots
containing potting mixture and coarse river sand (1:2, on volume
base). The plants were inoculated with a nematode suspension or
with nematode-infested oat root pieces. <i>P. penetrans</i>
originated from a greenhouse culture maintained on oats (courtesy
of Mr. van Bezooijen, Agricultural University Wageningen).
Nematodes for inoculum preparation were extracted from oat roots
in a mist chamber ('s Jacob and van Bezooijen 1984). Nematodes
were inoculated in suspension (470 per plant) or in infected
roots (210 per plant). The experiment was stopped at senescence
of the hemp plants, 2 months after inoculation. Nematodes were
extracted from the root system in a mist chamber and from the
soil with an Oostenbrink elutriator. The experiment was carried
out in a completely randomized design on a greenhouse bench at 20
°C. Per inoculum type, 5 replicates per plant species were
taken.</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Results</b></font></p>

<p> -<i>Verticillium dahliae</i><br>
The effect of the plants tested on the resulting disease index of
the potato test plants is shown in Table 1. Fibre hemp gave a
disease index in the bioassay that was not significantly
different from the resistant host plant wheat and the fallow
treatment. The susceptible host plant pea caused a significantly
higher disease index. This experiment was repeated with similar
results.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp sustained a large population of <i>P. penetrans</i>,
not statistically different from that of the susceptible host <i>P.
tanacetifolia</i>. The resistant host sugar beet had a much lower
final population.</p>

<p> <font size="4"><b>Discussion</b></font></p>

<p> Fibre hemp (cv. Kompolti Hibrid TC) was shown to be resistant
to <i>V. dahliae</i> and <i>M. chitwoodi</i>, but susceptible to <i>P.
penetrans</i>, under experimental conditions. Furthermore, it is
suggested that pulling of the stubble of fibre hemp directly
after harvest will reduce the formation of new microsclerotia of <i>V.
dahliae</i>. However, the experiments were conducted under
greenhouse conditions or in field trials at a single location and
in one year. This can make generalization of the results
precarious. Inclusion of crops of known host status in the
experiments reduces this problem. In this way it is possible to
draw conclusions on the host status of fibre hemp by comparison
with the other species.</p>

<p> Fibre hemp can possibly be used to suppress <i>M. chitwoodi</i>.
In the field experiment strong suppression was found and in the
laboratory experiment reduction of the population of <i>M.
chitwoodi</i> was evident even at very low inoculum levels. This
is an important result, because of the wide host range and the
high damage potential of this nematode.</p>

<p> The population suppression of <i>V. dahliae</i> by hemp was
similar to that on wheat or in the fallow treatment. But
above-ground parts of fibre hemp may contribute to the population
of <i>V. dahliae</i>, if the stubble is allowed to die off
naturally. Pulling the stubble inhibited the formation of
microsclerotia. This measure can further reduce the population of <i>V.
dahliae</i> after the cultivation of fibre hemp.</p>

<p> It seems that fibre hemp is susceptible to <i>P. penetrans</i>.
The results of the greenhouse experiment call for caution in
introducing fibre hemp in the crop rotation at sites where
problems with <i>P. penetrans</i> occur and susceptible crops are
grown. However, since this conclusion is based on greenhouse
experiments only, further studies are necessary to assess the
risks under field conditions.</p>

<p> The host suitability of a large number of hemp cultivars to
the root-knot nematode <i>Meloidogyne hapla</i> was tested by De
Meijer (1993). This author found varying resistance levels,
ranging from highly resistant to moderately susceptible host
quality. The standard cultivar, Kompolti Hibrid TC, had an
average reproduction rate of <i>M. hapla</i>, both in a
laboratory and a field trial. Similar results were obtained by
Kok and Coenen (unpublished results). However, since some sources
of hemp germplasm showed very high levels of resistance (De
Meijer 1993), it should be possible to develop fibre cultivars
with good yield properties and a high resistance level to <i>M.
hapla</i>.</p>

<p> Modern European fibre hemp cultivars are thought to be
relatively closely related. Landraces, ornamental cultivars and
drug varieties however seem to be more distantly related (De
Meijer and van Soest 1992). Therefore, generalization of the
results to the latter types of hemp is precarious.</p>

<p> The results presented indicate that fibre hemp reacts
differently to various soil-borne diseases and that the notion
that fibre hemp will cause no problems with diseases in crop
rotation is not generally justified. Cultivation of fibre hemp is
likely to reduce the population of <i>M. chitwoodi</i> and of <i>V.
dahliae</i>. Problems with <i>P. penetrans</i> however could be
increased by fibre hemp. The results presented here are, however,
more of a qualitative than of a quantitative nature. Long-term
field studies are necessary to accurately assess the quantitative
impact of the cultivation of fibre hemp on soil-borne diseases.</p>
