<H1>Ocean Tides</H1>
<p>
<p>
<h3>
The position of the Sun and Moon in the sky varies over time.  The changing position of the Sun and Moon causes very small changes in gravity which produces ocean tides.      
<p>
At the Earth's surface, the change in gravity due to the Moon is about twice as great as that of the Sun.  Sea level tends to be highest on the parts of the Earth's surface directly toward and directly opposite the Moon, creating tidal bulges, as shown below.

<p>
Where tidal bulges occur is tied to the Moon's position.   As the Earth rotates, the tidal bulges move across the oceans causing two daily high and two daily low tides.  The time when daily high and low tides occur changes as the Moon orbits around the Earth.  During any month, the biggest range between daily high and daily low tide happens at New Moon and Full Moon.
<p>
Many of history's great scientists including Galileo, Descartes, Kepler, Newton, Laplace, Bernoulli, Euler, and Lord Kelvin tried to predict the tides using <a href=hydrodyn_def.html>hydrodynamical</a> equations.  Now, with TOPEX/Poseidon's  global observations, tides are accurately known everywhere in the deep ocean.
<p>
Better knowledge of ocean tides can improve maritime navigation, help us track Earth-orbiting satellites, and enhance our understanding of the process that is slowing down the Earth's rotation and causing the Moon to slowly move farther away from us.
