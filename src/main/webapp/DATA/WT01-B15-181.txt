<html><h2>Notice of Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Services</h2>
<hr>
<body>
<strong>AGENCY:</strong> Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of
Energy. <p>
<strong>ACTION:</strong> Request for expression of interest and comments.<p>
<strong>SUMMARY:</strong> The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is
responsible under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (NWPA) for
transporting spent nuclear fuel (spent fuel) from commercial nuclear reactor sites to a
Federal facility for storage or disposal. The Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent
Fuel and/or High Level Radioactive Waste (10 CFR part 961) details the arrangements
between the Department and the owners and generators of spent fuel (Purchasers) for
the Department to accept the spent fuel at the Purchasers' sites for transport to the
receiving Federal facility. Section 137(a)2 of the NWPA requires the utilization of
private industry to the "fullest extent possible" in the transportation of spent fuel.
 OCRWM is developing a plan for the performance of its waste acceptance, storage
and transportation responsibilities which are set forth in the NWPA and Standard
Contract and is soliciting input from interested parties as to its proposed approach.
 DATES: Submissions of interest and comments in response to this Notice should be
received by the Department no later than three weeks from the date of this
announcement. A presolicitation conference may be held this summer, if so, a separate
Notice will be issued identifying the date. Respondents to this Notice will be placed on
a list to receive additional information which may include draft solicitation documents
in preparation for the presolicitation conference.<p>
<strong>ADDRESSES:</strong> Submissions of interest including any comments should be sent to:
Michelle Miskinis, Contracting Officer, U. S. Dept. Of Energy, 1000 Independence
Ave. SW, Attention: HR - 561.21, Washington D.C. 20585. <p>
<strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> Ms Michelle Miskinis
(DOE/HR+561.21), 202-634-4413 or Ms Beth Tomasoni (DOE/HR-561.21),     202-634-4408. <p>
<strong>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</strong> The following describes key features of the
OCRWM proposed approach:<br>
Scope of Services: DOE anticipates contracting for supplies and services which
would include: accepting spent fuel from Purchasers' facilities (as identified in the
Acceptance Priority Ranking and Annual Capacity Reports and supplying compatible
transportation (and possibly storage) casks and equipment and transporting spent fuel
to a designated Federal facility. Contractors would also be responsible for any
intermodal transport required, including heavy haul. Contractors may be permitted to
alter the order of spent-fuel acceptance to achieve efficiency of operation or to lower
costs. Contractors would work with Purchasers to determine the best way to service a
site and would recommend preferred transportation routes to the Federal facility.
Contractors will also be required to interface with those State, Local and Tribal
governments along the selected routes.<p>
The location and type of Federal facility (either a repository or an interim storage
facility (ISF) cannot yet be determined. Initially, spent-fuel delivered to the Federal
site would be canistered before arrival at the facility, but at some point in the service
period the contractor may be required to handle uncanistered spent-fuel.
Transportation and storage equipment to be supplied would be required to comply
with applicable Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and Department of
Transportation (DOT) regulations, OCRWM acceptance criteria, and standard
commercial practices.<p>
Contract Type: Competitive, fixedprice type, contracts are being considered with a
phased implementation that includes sequential development of business/servicing
plans describing contractors' individual approaches, fabrication/acquisition of
hardware, and transportation services operations. More than one award is anticipated.
One approach under consideration is to divide the country into regions, for example,
the four NRC regions. No contractor would be awarded more than two regional service
contracts. It is envisioned that there will be several Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
issued over several decades for these services with more than one award made under
each RFP.<p>
Contract Term: A contract term of five to ten years is envisioned. This would allow a
contractor two to three years to procure transportation and storage equipment and
achieve operational readiness. Performance of waste acceptance and transportation
services would take place over the remaining period of any contract. A service period
spanning several years also would allow contractors the flexibility to improve the
efficiency of operations and reduce costs.<p>
Schedule: Schedule specifics will be addressed in any solicitation. For planning
purposes, it is expected that a Federal facility could be in operation to receive spent
fuel within four years of statutory direction, and contractors could be expected to begin
developing service arrangements with Purchasers two to three years before spent fuel
shipment.<p>
<strong>Submissions of Interest</strong><p>
  OCRWM is interested in receiving expressions of interest and comments relating to
this proposed approach for carrying out its waste acceptance, transportation and any
storage functions especially with regard to the following Issues:<br>
<ol>
<li>The ability of transportation service contractors and individual Purchasers to reach
agreement on methods and schedules for servicing specific utility sites, including ways
to foster Purchaser cooperation .<br>
<li>The willingness of Purchasers to construct temporary or permanent physical plant
modifications and to obtain license amendments or technical specification changes that
would improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of loading and removal of spent
fuel from individual plants.<br>
<li>The reasonableness of dividing the country into a number of regions to preserve
competition and industrial capability in the marketplace, while still ensuring low cost
services to OCRWM.<br>
<li>The capability of the nuclear industry to acquire sufficient spent fuel canister,
transportation cask, and storage module production capacity to meet near-term service
contractor requirements.<br>
<li> Potential business arrangements/ pricing structures which might increase contractor
freedom and flexibility to develop and implement innovative approaches to improve
system efficiency and lower costs, reduce or eliminate the need for front-end financing
by OCRWM of contractor activities and procurements, or mitigate risks associated
with programmatic uncertainties.<br>
<li>Alternative methods of structuring this procurement to ensure competition on
future procurements.</ol><p>
DOE will consider and may utilize all information, recommendations, and suggestions provided in response to this notice. Respondents should not provide any
information that they consider to be privileged or confidential or which the respondent
does not want disclosed to the public. DOE does not intend to respond to comments,
either to individual commentors or by publication of a formal notice. Each submittal
should consist of one original and three photocopies.
<p>
This notice should not be construed (1) as a commitment by the Department to enter
into any agreement with any entity submitting an expression of interest or comments
in response to this Notice, (2) as a commitment to issue any RFP concerning the
subject of this Notice, or (3) as a request for proposals.<p>
