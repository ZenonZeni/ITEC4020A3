Sit Back and Enjoy Your Upgrade

By:
Richard March

It's a new year and a new look for VARBusiness. Whether you
flipped through the pages or consulted the table of contents
to get here, you've probably noticed something's different.
It's our design. The typeface, the format of the charts, and
the layout of print and graphics are new. Those changes are
part of what we're calling an upgrade. We haven't changed our
primary mission of providing you with technology, product and
business information. What we've changed is the way you get
that information. Foremost, the pages are easier to read. They're
less cluttered. In some cases the subheads or decks are longer
to give you a better idea of what the story is about. The smaller
stories-known as sidebars-that accompany larger stories are
"aired out" and not text-heavy. The charts and information
boxes are cleaner and more direct, allowing you to scan and
absorb the information faster.

Another way to maximize your time with VARBusiness is to know
where your favorite departments are. Therefore, we've streamlined
the magazine's format by grouping similar departments together
into supersections. In the Products supersection you'll find
Product Report, Beta Test and Editor's Choice (formerly Tech
Alert). The Technology supersection covers Networking, Software
and Computer Telephony.

Our expanded Business supersection includes familiar departments
such as Program Profiles and Distribution from our former Business
Sense section. But there are also new departments such as Executive
Challenge, which tackles difficult management topics. CustomerSpeak
gives insight into what your clients want from you. VAR Deals
provides details and analysis of noteworthy contracts and installations.
Heads Up is a collection of research and statistics that shape
the market. The VAR Biz Quiz will keep you on your toes-and
to keep your vendors on their toes, we've restructured the
Annual Report Card In Depth, highlighting exclusive findings
from our yearly survey.

Between the supersections you'll find our familiar cover and
feature stories and quarterly sections. Our in-depth content
will continue to point out ways to adopt and sell new technologies
that will increase your profits. But the new look of those
stories will reflect the reader-friendly approach you see elsewhere
in the magazine. Last but far from least, there's a new section
up front called @VARBusiness. You'll find bite-sized bits and
tips on the Internet and online markets. Our State of the VAR
Market research found that four out of 10 VARs will be selling
Internet solutions this year. We'll be paying close attention
to this burgeoning market and delivering you targeted information.

So kick back and enjoy your upgrade.

Web Wherabouts



I've noticed with some chagrin that when you list companies
and their contact information, you fail to list their Internet
and/or Web addresses. Clearly this must be an oversight on
your part. Given the degree of commitment CMP has to the Internet,
one could only come to this conclusion.

Today, any computer company that does not have at least an e
mail address cannot truly call itself a computer company. Any
manufacturer who does not have a Web page is doing a disservice
not only to its clients, but also to itself.

Editor's Reply: Wayne, we couldn't agree more. As of our Dec.
1, 1995 issue, we started listing Web addresses in our Quick
Scans.

Proper Netiquette



Somewhere I remember seeing a list of Internet/Online Etiquette
and acronyms. Do you have this or know where I could get a
copy? I have a new client who actually wants to read a little
before he ventures into the great unknown of cyberspace. (Reading
before trying? What a concept! <G>)

Thanks to all of you at VIX [the VARBusiness Interactive Exchange
on CompuServe]. My time on VIX is probably the most gainful
hours of the week as far as knowledge goes. It's really nice
to share ideas, information and resolutions with others.

Editor's Reply: There are quite a few books with chapters devoted
to this topic. One is The Online Marketing Handbook by Daniel
S. Janal (published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York), which
explains "netiquette" in simple terms. Also, check out www.organic.com
1800collect/Netiquette/index.html on the Internet.

More On ISO



The article "Everything About ISO 9000 (Sept. 1, 1995, page
39) was missing information regarding the application of ISO
9000 to software (computer programs and data). While ISO 9001
could be related to the software as a product, organizations
interested in being certified to ISO 9000 standards should
follow the guidelines stipulated in ISO 9000-3. These guidelines
apply to the application of ISO 9001 for the development, supply
and maintenance of software. The article was correct as is,
but I think your readers would benefit to know of ISO 9000
3 as well.

My organization, the Software Certification Institute, offers
consulting and seminars in ISO 9000-3.

CORRECTIONS



The conclusion of "Taking a Stand on Disk Interface Standards"
(Nov. 15, 1995, page 149) was omitted due to a printer's error.
The complete article is now available on the VARBusiness Interactive
Exchange on CompuServe (Go VIX) and on our Internet home page,
techweb.cmp.com/vb.

In Distribution Briefs (Oct. 1, page 48), PC Service Source's
phone number was incorrect. The correct number is (800) 727
2787.

Interactive Solutions Group should have been identified as a
multimedia VAR established by former members of Intel's Technology
Solutions Specialist digital video VAR team (see "Multimedia
VARs Make the Video Connection," Nov. 1, page 3A)

Heard On VIX



Despite industry efforts, home PC sales are below expectations,
and margins are lower than for traditional consumer electronics.
One solution has been proposed by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison:
an easy-to-use $500 box that provides Internet connectivity
and basic computing power. In this thread from VIX, the VARBusiness
Interactive Exchange on CompuServe, VARs and editors kick around
the merits of such a box.

T.C. Doyle, industry editor, VARBusiness: Ellison is right about
one thing. PCs are too difficult to use. They should cut down
on the optional functionality and make it more appliance-like.
Then it will sell by the gazillions, just like VCRs.

Gary McClellan, president, Gary D. McClellan and Associates
Ltd.: We'll see the ultimate consumer box show up as a big
PDA.

Hillary Rettig, technology editor, VARBusiness: You're really
onto something here. Maybe a little PDA with a robust docking
station. Then I can have my PDA call your PDA <g>.

McClellan: Combine a PDA with a robust docking station and have
the cable industry finally get around to making TCP/IP available.
Price it around $500 and include the services in my cable bill
and I'll buy it!

Ian G. Jacobs, software editor, VARBusiness: Why do you need
limited performance? You can put together a clone system for
less than $1,000.

Rettig: Right, then you spend $3,000 fixing and maintaining
that clone over the next few years. Does anyone think that
any of the big consumer electronics companies, or even one
of the toy companies, couldn't produce this box?

Jim Ziron, owner, JR Consulting: It's been tried. Is the market
more ready for it now than in the past? How does your ideal
$500 unit keep up with changing technology?

Rettig: I can think of three possible solutions: Make it modular;
make it "thin"; or make it disposable. After all, replacing
a $500 unit once every three years is still a lot cheaper than
what most home users spend on PC hardware right now.

Cool VAR Home Page

By:
Krista Ostertag

Networking VAR BTG Inc.'s Web site offers real value to its
customers, including an online catalog with current prices.
"With pricing changing as rapidly as it does, it's easier to
update prices online than on paper," says Chip Bumgardner,
vice president and chief technical officer. Online ordering
will be available soon. BTG's site lists news releases, links
to other Web sites, employment opportunities, investor info
and a "how to contact" page. Even with graphically rich pages,
download time is fast. More than 25 people contribute to BTG's
Web site. Webmasters add HTML coding to the pages without using
an authoring tool, but BTG will use Netscape Gold once it's
released. Advice for the rest of us? Bumgardner suggests VARs
structure their sites so updating the information is easy.
Contact BTG Inc., Vienna, Va., (703) 556-6518, www.btg.com

Hot Online Products -- Authoring tools to write home about

By:
Krista Ostertag

Internet publishing tools can help VARs create Web sites and
intranetworks for customers. With so many tools on the market,
though, it's hard to decide which to use. Some products are
making waves in the Internet community:

HoTMetaL Pro. SoftQuad Inc.'s HoTMetaL Pro 2.0 Web authoring
tool doesn't require prior knowledge of HTML. Users can point
and-click from the toolbar to insert the tags and hypertext
links. HoTMetaL Pro imports and converts files created on Windows
and Unix platforms and has word processing capabilities such
as spell check, search and replace, macro support and style
controls. HoTMetaL Pro also lets users create customized templates.
Contact SoftQuad, Toronto, (800) 387-2777, www.sq.com.

Blackbird. This is the code name for Microsoft's Internet publishing
system that creates and manages full multimedia titles. Blackbird
originally was designed for use with MSN, but it now can be
used for the Internet and CD-ROM titles, too. Based on the
OLE environment, Blackbird lets VARs integrate applications
for customized online design. It also has drag-and-drop capabilities
and does not require HTML coding know-how. The Blackbird system
comes with the Blackbird Designer, Server, Client and templates
for use with Windows 95. Contact Microsoft, (206) 882-8080,
www.microsoft.com.

Emissary. You can point-and-click or drag-and-drop to create
Internet or intranet files with Emissary from The Wollongong
Group Inc. Emissary provides automatic interpretation of all
Internet protocols and supports full multimedia capabilities.
Emissary lets users surf the Web from a single interface and
window, manage news, e-mail, access FTP sites and run telnet
sessions. Emissary uses the Client Object Linking Technology
architecture, which lets VARs add custom features. Contact
Wollongong, Palo Alto, Calif., (800) 872-8649, www.twg.com.

What Price Technology? -- It's tough to measure the cost of
a satisfied customer


When was the last time you heard anyone say-and mean-"Money
is no object?" Most times price is a very important object.

Our Product Report survey on hubs (page 31) indicates that price
is very important to VARs, all things being equal. Beta Test
(page 37) offers VARs' first impressions of Sybase's new System
11, a relational database management system upgrade that is
crucially important to Sybase. One pecuniary factor in its
favor: Better performance can give fresh life to legacy systems.

Editor's Choice (page 43) features HP's new network scanner,
which combines swift scanning with built-in LAN connectivity.
"At $2,995 for the Ethernet version," writes Hillary Rettig,
"the unit should sell like hotcakes to larger businesses, but
could be too expensive for smaller ones."

True, unless you can convince small-business customers of its
value as part of a document imaging solution. The question
then becomes how much money they'll save.

Product Report: Hub Verdict: Cost is King -- Standard Microsystems Corp. wins
first place, but 3Com sells best

By:
Julie Bort

Once a relatively simple device, today's hub is changing. Not
just repeaters anymore, hub vendors are loading their products
with intelligence, network management, integrated routing functions,
support for switching devices, and on and on. In exchange for
all this, top-tier vendors are charging top dollars. But instead
of reveling in increased functionality, some VARs are frustrated
with the "more features for more money" direction the market
is taking. Many VARs say that unmanaged hubs, at more affordable
prices, are enough to do the trick.

Those are among the findings of this month's Product Report,
a VARBusiness research project that surveyed 218 hub resellers
on the product features and performance of the hub vendors
that sell to VARs.

The survey turned up a number of surprises. First, Standard
Microsystems Corp. won the Product Report, followed by Bay
Networks and Hewlett-Packard. But 3Com was named VARs' best
selling hub vendor by far, despite finishing fifth overall.

VARs also made it clear they want vendors to support a wide
range of technologies, but not at the expense of the bottom
line. The range of technologies a vendor's hubs support and
the price per port were judged equally important criteria when
sourcing a hub. Clearly, resellers don't want to pay high prices
when a simple unmanaged hub will do the job.

Moreover, VARs want hubs that are hubs, not hybrid routers:
Integrated routing was one of the two least important product
criteria. Instead, VARs look for hubs that are scalable and
have network management features. Another surprise is that
such scalability and management shouldn't necessarily be in
the form of a stackable hub, an option vendors are promoting
heavily. VARs graded the stackable chassis options as second
to last in importance. Rather, VARs prefer support for switching
and WAN technologies.

SMC On Top

Standard Microsystems finished first thanks to its top scores
in range of technologies and price per port.

"We wanted to deliver a managed, stackable hub at the same price
per port as an unmanaged one," explains Hugh Kelly, marketing
program manager for SMC. Specifically, its entry-level member
of the TigerHub 100-Mbit family, the TigerHub 100, is an 8
port Fast Ethernet repeater listed at about $200 per port-or
$1,595. SMC's entry-level Ethernet TigerHub family is priced
as low as $225 for a 6-port, 10Base-T, 1 AUI port version.

This is comparable with Bay Network's stackable solution-the
BayStack family-which carries a price per port of about $200
for a 10-Mbit/s Ethernet hub, and offers interconnection with
switching and routing products. The list price is $2,375 for
a 12-port, 10Base-T Ethernet stackable hub, according to the
company. VARs rated Bay Networks in the middle of the pack
on price per port, giving it a 6.2 rating compared with winner
SMC's 8.3 score. The last-place score in this criterion was
a 5.6, given to IBM.

"SMC lets you break a network into more segments but still manage
it," says David Gloria, vice president of technology for DBA
Computer Integrators, a Richardson, Texas-based Unix system
integrator that resells hubs from 3Com, HP, SMC and others.
"HP has better name recognition and a lot of bigger shops out
there. So does IBM, but they're not the highest-performing
machines."

The situation points to one of the biggest battles raging among
VARs in the hub market: managed top-tier products vs. unmanaged
clones. Tellingly, scores were all over the map on price per
port.

"Users are looking at the hub to take on more of the network
architecture and to be part of a bigger solution," says Brian
Lees, CEO of Concepts 2000, a NetWare VAR in Davenport, Iowa,
that resells hubs from more than half a dozen vendors. "As
part of an overall solution, many hubs are too expensive. A
hub is a hub."

"Name brand hubs are too expensive," according to Gloria. "I
don't need management if I'm just doing a media conversion
from 10Base-T to AUI. Of course, as with any clone product,
it's cheaper. The technology is just not there, so there'll
be a performance difference and they won't have as long a life
cycle."

Price-And a Whole Lot More

Such trade-offs mean that price alone is not the biggest reason
to recommend a product. The best-selling hubs turned out to
be 3Com's, with almost a third of the resellers selling or
recommending that company's products most often. That was almost
double the number recommending or selling the next biggest
seller, HP.

3Com was also named as having most improved during the past
year; HP closely followed. VARs claim that better support of
the hub channel is why they like working with 3Com.

"3Com is easier to get, it's easier to install, and easier for
a regional VAR to do an implementation for a national company,"
says Howard Podgurski, executive vice president of DocuTech,
a client-server systems integrator in Warminster, Pa. "If you
are installing a WAN and the customer has locations in New
York, Philadelphia and San Francisco, as a regional VAR you
could do New York and Philadelphia yourself, while 3Com would
do the San Francisco installation. This kind of support of
their VARs gives them a competitive advantage."

Making the Choice

Beyond price, exactly what technologies a particular installation
requires will determine which hub to source, since each vendor
has varying strengths and weaknesses.

For example, while all vendors achieved fairly good scores for
their support of a range of technologies, how a vendor implemented
a specific technology ranged widely. Only one vendor, HP, had
a particularly high rating for its scalability.

Network management rankings were fairly close, with the highest
score awarded to SMC (7.9) and the lowest to Proteon (6.9).
No vendor scored particularly high for its support of switching
technology-with scores ranging from 7.5, awarded to Bay Networks,
to 6.7, achieved by HP and Digital. Finally, VARs found integrated
routing capabilities to be the most poorly implemented feature,
with the lowest rating in the survey, a 5.8, earned by Proteon.

The message is clear: VARs need hubs to be hubs, but must carefully
weigh how well a vendor supports specific technologies before
choosing.

Beta Test: Is Sybase Back on Track? -- With SQL Server 11, our VAR beta
testers say yes

By:
Hillary Rettig

Some upgrades are evolutionary, some are revolutionary, and
some save the company. Database supplier Sybase Inc.'s System
11 upgrade may belong in the last category. It is the successor
to System 10, a product even the manufacturer considered flawed.
System 10 suffered from poor performance, poor scalability
and bugs. During its three-year release period, Sybase's earnings
plunged, and its market share declined.

Most analysts believe the System 11 upgrade has to be a home
run to salvage Sybase's reputation as a top-ranked RDBMS vendor.
VAR reviewers and VARBusiness Advisory Board members George
Anderson, vice president of Enterprise Engineering Inc., and
Peter Storer, vice president of client-server consulting at
Atre Associates Inc., tested SQL Server 11 and are enthusiastic
about what they've seen.

They see quality as fundamental-especially since both were burned
by System 10. Anderson has been trying to find bugs in System
11, but says he has not been successful.

Still, SQL Server 11 isn't without flaws. Its lack of record
level locking and omission of parallel data query features
are two widely discussed drawbacks. Moreover, Anderson says
the product could benefit from better dynamic reconfiguration
abilities.

It's the Quality, Stupid!

The core of Sybase System 11 is Sybase's RDBMS, Sybase SQL Server
11. Improvements to the database can be summed up in three
words: quality, performance and scalability, says Daniel Lahl,
director of Sybase's Server Products Management Group.

Quality is reflected in the company's decision to pursue ISO
9001 certification, a rigorous procedure that involves quality
control processes and documentation. It is also reflected,
Lahl says, in a $10 million investment in testing and revised
quality control procedures.

As for performance and scalability, it's all in the numbers.
The mood was jubilant when Sybase announced at a press conference
that SQL Server 11 had achieved 5,621.07 transactions per minute
type C (tpmC) on a 12-processor HP9000 Model T500, and a record
4,544.60 tpmC on a 16-processor Sun SPARCcenter 2000E. Equally
important, says Lahl, is Sybase's hardware cost per tpmC. At
$380 on the HP and $396 on the Sun, it's significantly less
than rivals Oracle and Informix.

Our reviewers say those improvements are on target. They also
are impressed with the decision to pursue ISO 9001 certification,
and they note dramatic improvements in the performance and
scalability of SQL Server 11. Anderson in particular applauds
its price/performance ratio. He ran comparative bulk data loads
of Version 10 on a fast SPARCstation 1000 and Version 11 on
a slower SPARCstation 10. Version 11 beat Version 10 hands
down.

"If I can get equal or better performance on worse hardware,"
he says, "that means this software is really performing."

Unresolved Questions

If SQL Server 11's achievements have been well-publicized, so
have its flaws-in particular, its use of page-level, rather
than record-level, locking.

The most obvious problem with page-level locking is that SAP
America's popular R/2 and R/3 applications won't work with
it. According to Ellen Brezniak, director of product management
at rival database vendor Progress Software Corp., however,
the issue is broader. "It's about portability," she says. "We
have many resellers who want to write applications against
a variety of back ends. They're fine with Progress and Oracle,
but they have to rearchitect to work with Sybase."

Page-level locking also limits the types of applications a VAR
can develop. "It's best for applications with short transaction
times, such as finance, but less appropriate for manufacturing
or customer service," says Brezniak.

Our VARs-many of whose customers are in finance-are ambivalent.
"I wish Sybase would do it [record-level locking], so I wouldn't
have to hear people talk about it," says Anderson. "At the
same time, I don't think it's a big deal to my customers."
Sybase's Lahl sees it as a concern only for SAP shops. "If
it were that crucial, we would have put it into 11." Sybase
will add the feature by late 1996, he says.

Our reviewers were more concerned about SQL Server 11's other
significant omission, parallel data query, which allows a database
to break down complex queries into subroutines and assign each
to a separate processor. "The omission is a little disappointing,"
bemoans Anderson. Says Storer, "We really need it for the big,
decision-support type queries." Lahl promises the feature by
mid-1996.

SQL Server 11 represents just one part of Sybase's enterprise
computing strategy, according to Lahl. The company's goal is
to provide best-of-breed products not only for online transaction
processing, but also for data warehousing and mass deployment.
Sybase defines mass deployment as running an application across
a wide range of hardware platforms, including desktops, laptops,
PDAs and information kiosks. Some of those products include
Sybase MPP, a data warehousing tool; Sybase IQ, an ad-hoc querying
tool; and SQL Anywhere, a repackaged version of Watcom SQL
from Watcom International Corp., a Sybase company.

Our beta reviewers didn't get the chance to review those products,
although in some cases they were familiar with earlier versions.
Storer is particularly enthusiastic about Sybase's data warehousing
strategy. "It's the right way for them to be going, particularly
given their great interconnectivity. We are really ramping
up our data warehousing business, and this is going to be one
of the leading platforms for us."

He's less enthusiastic, though, about mass deployment. "We worked
with one client who could have used this," he says, "but that
was only one." He also wants to wait and see how interoperable
SQL Anywhere is with SQL Server.

Anderson is enthusiastic about mass deployment. "I see a lot
of potential for mobile users and others," he says, noting
that while his company and some clients could use it, other
vendors have tried it and haven't done too well.

The bottom line for our reviewers is that Sybase System 11's
benefits far outweigh its deficiencies. "They've chosen exactly
the right things to focus on," says Storer, citing the quality,
performance and scalability. As an independent consultant,
he never stopped recommending Sybase to clients even during
the heyday of System 10's troubles. Now he says because of
the lack of bugs he can recommend System 11 more confidently.

As a Sybase business partner, Anderson's fortunes are more directly
linked to System 11. He has plans to deploy it for at least
one customer as soon as it's released. His only wish, aside
from the record-level locking and parallelism issues mentioned
earlier, is for more dynamic reconfiguration abilities. "We
run in a lot of 24/7 environments," he says. "If I need to
reconfigure the server, I have to pull it down. That's hard
to do sometimes, particularly if you have a worldwide application."

VARs interested in client-server development should get on board
now, Lahl says. "The message is that we're back," he says,
"and we're going to be very, very strong."

Editor's Choice: HP Scans the LAN -- New ScanJet brings more power to 
the network

By:
Hillary Rettig

Movie buffs may recall the scene in 9 To 5 in which Jane Fonda,
playing a stressed secretary, does battle with a recalcitrant
copier. That character may be about to have her revenge. Hewlett
Packard has just upgraded its popular ScanJet scanner family
with several new products, and one of the new offerings-the
ScanJet 4Si-may take a big bite out of the $27 billion worldwide
xerographic copier market. It also may help VARs in the document
image processing market, where 43 percent of all VARs now sell,
according to VARBusiness research.

The 4Si, like its predecessors, is a flatbed unit offering 300
dot-per-inch resolution. Scanning speed, however, has been
increased to 15 pages per minute. That's considerably faster
than comparably priced scanners, although still slower than
most copiers. HP says the 4Si can scan, process and view a
15-page document in 2.5 minutes. The 4Si comes with a 50-page
automatic document feeder and the "light" version of OmniPage,
optical character recognition software from Caere Corp., Los
Gatos, Calif.

Two of the 4Si's features stand out. Its built-in network connectivity
a first for any scanner-lets you plug the scanner directly
into any Ethernet (10Base-T) or token ring NetWare 3.x or 4.x
network. HP bundles an SNMP-compliant utility to make net management
easy.

The other plus is a bundled 20-user version of PaperPort from
Visioneer Inc., Palo Alto, Calif. PaperPort is a document management
system that lets users easily view, sort, group, route and
otherwise manipulate documents. It has been around for years
with overall good reviews, but sales were never brisk. HP's
bundling may indicate that the market has caught up with it.

The combination of network connectivity and document management
is powerful and may herald a new era for the concept of the
paperless office. If any company has the power to promote the
concept, it's HP. My only concern about the 4Si is its price.
At $2,995 for the Ethernet version and $3,199 list for the
token ring, the unit should sell like hotcakes to larger businesses
but could be too expensive for smaller ones.

Editor's Choice: Doubleplay Delivers -- Dual drive is twice as nice, in 
function and in price

By:
Karen Balch

A new version of ComByte Inc.'s dual-drive combo is getting
double takes from VARs with cost- and space-conscious customers.
At 1994's Fall Comdex, ComByte made a big splash with Doubleplay,
its combination QIC-80 tape drive and floppy drive in a single
3.5-inch, half-height internal package. ComByte, then a relatively
unknown company, introduced the product, which benefited VARs
with storage-hungry customers whose budgets and drive bays
couldn't satisfy their needs.

Besides the obvious ergonomic advantages of putting two drives
in one bay, there are also hidden performance gains. For example,
the higher performance motor required to drive the tape engine
works to double the spin rate of the floppy drive, making the
drive capable of reading and writing at 1 Mbit/s.

Doubleplay's dual drives don't just share space, though; they
share electronic components as well. It's not a "two-drives
in-one" package as much as it's a "two-in-one" solution that
appears as a single logical device to the host. But two things
were missing from Doubleplay's initial release: portability
of the drive and backup software that took full advantage of
the drive's unique design.

You might wonder why users would need to move the drive if they
could take out the media. If your customers want to avoid duplicating
drive purchases and plan to move data between home and office
or between multiple office locations, they'll still have to
read the tape or floppy they're toting. So now, ComByte is
offering an external version of the Doubleplay. This version
connects to the computer through the printer port, yet allows
the user to print. The ability to plug in the drive so easily
may entice users to take it with them, resulting in savings
on other storage media.

With either the internal or external version, users can download
large files off the Internet or save multimedia or graphics
files to tape, and avoid loading their hard drives with those
projects in the process. As for the backup software, NovaStor,
Simi Valley, Calif., developed a package specifically for ComByte
that's bundled with the internal and external versions of the
drive.

Finally, even though the current version of Doubleplay can handle
QIC-80, extended-length and QIC-Wide tapes as well as floppy
disks, ComByte plans to make a TR-3 Travan-ready drive available
during the first quarter of this year. Travan minicartridges
have expanded, adding more tape and increasing their capacities
into the gigabyte range.

With all these enhancements, Doubleplay's definitely worth a
double take.

Editor's Choice: A Changing Worldgroup -- Galacticomm's groupware-BBS hybrid
is VAR-friendly

By:
Ian G. Jacobs

Most VARs who deal in groupware don't think much about bulletin
board systems (BBSs). Galacticomm Inc.'s new Worldgroup product
may change that. Worldgroup combines the electronic mail, discussion
forums, file exchange and other communications tools of the
standard BBS with multiple methods of access-such as LAN and
modem-common to groupware packages.

Worldgroup includes a Windows-based client application. The
client installs with the same ease as most Windows applications.

When customers dial into a Worldgroup server with a communications
package, they'll see a standard bulletin board system with
an ANSI, ASCII or RIP interface. But if they use the Worldgroup
client to access the Worldgroup server, they'll encounter what
amounts to a Windows-based online service. The basic look falls
much closer to the WinCIM interface for CompuServe than it
does to a standard BBS.

This Worldgroup interface can be completely customized. If your
customers have a standard desktop look, you can modify Worldgroup
to meet those standards. A municipal system could be built
to resemble a map of the city with icons for the library and
city hall leading to applications for checking on overdue fines
and city taxes. With a Worldgroup Developer's Kit, Galacticomm
gives you the Visual Basic and C source code to Worldgroup
so you can create completely new client applications.

The Worldgroup server runs under DOS on your host computer,
but most of the data that would slow communications is stored
on the client. This speeds the information transfer between
client and server and allows you to use a less than state-of
the-art PC as host.

Galacticomm's Internet Connectivity Option for Worldgroup can
turn your Worldgroup server into a World Wide Web server and
support up to 60 simultaneous connections. Users will be able
to Telnet out from your system to anywhere on the Net.

Galacticomm has an impressive list of ISVs who have created
add-on products to work with Worldgroup. This can make customization
much easier, especially if you've got ambitious projects in
mind-such as electronic commerce-that require a great deal
of programming skill. Some of the more intriguing applications
 a system to process credit cards online; a classified advertising
module; an application that can integrate pagers into the Worldgroup
system; and a faxing module.

Those possibilities should excite resellers looking to broaden
the scope of their groupware offerings. One caveat: To accommodate
all of the communications and specialized graphics, Galacticomm
has allowed the client to bloat, sometimes to more than 10
Mbytes. Users will need a good deal of free space to reap its
benefits.

One World, Many Systems -- Make your resolution to bring pieces
together


The new year brings about thoughts of peace and prosperity.
We hope for a world in which everyone works together in peace.
But in your world, you can rejoice that all kinds of different,
complex systems don't work well together.

It shows in our Software story (page 57) on data warehousing.
Those projects involve a bevy of systems from vendors that
reside all over the enterprise. Networking (page 51) illustrates
similar problems in network management: "Vendors have succeeded
in confusing customers with an avalanche of products that do
not interoperate" writes Cassimir Medford, "and at best they
produce reams of data that bewilder even trained engineers."
Computer Telephony (page 65) has six strategies to bring joy
to small business.

In this new year, think of your role as a peacekeeper: You bring
peace to the systems world. Prosperity is your reward, and
that's a good thing any time of year.

Networking: `Productizing' Service -- New England VAR paves way into new
net management trend

By:
Cassimir Medford

It hardly seemed like a historic event. In fact, it looked like
any other analyst-vendor meeting. The suits at one end of the
table were attempting to doctor the spin on their new product.
The analysts at the other end regarded them with little more
than the usual polite reserve.

But this meeting was different. At the vendor end of the table
sat Peter Cowie and Michael Reagan of New England Systems (NES),
a Boston VAR. Cowie and Reagan had taken on a challenging task
 They had to figure out a way to explain InfraMax, NES' remote
network management product that is not really a product. It's
a service made possible by the cobbling together of a number
of commercially available products. It's not based on a specific
platform. It includes some consulting but is not a consulting
product. As with many things in the VAR channel, NES' product
does not fit neatly into any mold.

In essence, NES' mission that day was to define a new market
 the "productized" service.

Realizing his was not an easy message to impart, Cowie searched
the analysts' eyes for signs of glazing. He needn't have worried.
By the time the tour was over, an unlikely star was born. NES,
an 85-person VAR, wowed the normally tough-to-impress Boston
analyst community.

"At first I did not know what to expect. I was used to a product
orientation toward network management," says Sylvia Clark,
senior research analyst with the Aberdeen Group Inc., Boston.
"Here was this service company with a customercentric message.
And it wasn't about outsourcing. It met customers' needs whether
those needs are narrow or broad. I was impressed."

NES' approach is a timely one. After a decade of trying, vendors
are still unable to solve the enterprise management puzzle.
They have succeeded in confusing customers with an avalanche
of products that do not interoperate. And at best they produce
reams of data that bewilder even trained engineers.

Cowie's tour of Boston's market makers was an attempt to explore
the possibilities of looking at network management in a new
light. To his way of thinking, VARs are structurally and culturally
suited to the task of network management.

"I thought the 'productized' service was a trend that analysts
needed to understand. They've been too focused on the latest
product releases," says Cowie, CEO of NES. "We created a service
that corporate America needs to know about, and analysts are
well-positioned to carry that message."

Survey after survey indicates that corporate America is willing
to outsource the responsibility for network management to service
companies such as systems integrators and VARs. Integrators
such as EDS and Andersen Consulting continue to win lucrative
management contracts from the Fortune 500, but VARs have not
shared in this multibillion-dollar windfall.

Some question whether smaller resellers such as NES are credible
enough or financially stable enough to win the respect and
the projects of the Fortune 500, but James Greene, an analyst
at Summit Strategies Inc. in Boston, votes yea. "VARs are at
the point where they can be presented to the Fortune 500 as
a service option," he says. "Of course, the case can be made
that they have certain geographic and technical limitations
that may prove unattractive to the Fortune 500. But their strengths
are in their vendor-independence and wide-ranging distributed
systems expertise."

Cowie and his NES brain trust know the limitations of a small
VAR, but they are hoping that their InfraMax service gets them
some recognition among larger companies. They see an opening
and are trying to push their influence up the corporate ladder.
This is a fairly bold move that analysts believe was almost
unthinkable even a year ago.

The New Wave

"There is a change in attitude in the analyst community. They
have come to realize that VARs represent a force in the network
management market," says Tom Nolle, president of Cimi Corp.,
a Voorhees, N.J., technology assessment firm. "They know that
integrated management has failed as a product, so they are
willing to entertain companies like NES that are able to provide
it as a service."

So far, NES has been able to snag four customers with another
10 in the wings. The latest is a Boston-area network of seven
hospitals that tracks psychiatric patients who seek care at
area hospitals. The network, the Boston Emergency Services
Team (BEST) Crisis Management System, was built by NES. It's
a network through which the hospitals can share information
about psychiatric patients, particularly homeless patients
who walk into any number of those hospitals for treatment.
The network prevents "cocktail mixing" by patients-a potentially
life-threatening situation caused by the mixing of drugs prescribed
by multiple hospitals. The network helps not only with keeping
track of the patients but also with research about the homeless.

NES uses InfraMax, its remote management product, to monitor
and manage the BEST wide area network. InfraMax is a mix of
agent technology that monitors and reports network information.
Performance alerts are transmitted periodically from the InfraMax
agents at the customer site to a notification server at NES'
Waltham, Mass., facility. The notification server applies customized
filters that trap some predefined alerts and pass others up
to the NES command center, where 65 engineers monitor and respond
to the alerts.

For Ed Budelmann, director of BEST, InfraMax frees his organization
to concentrate on providing medical information rather than
dealing with system bugs or thresholds. "NES provided the interface
with the vendors that we needed, and that saved us a great
deal of time," he says.

For NES, BEST represents what the channel can achieve. The company
hopes it's the start of a new chapter in its network management
saga.

Service Companies Emerge

Along with large organizations, the departmental/workgroup market
in small to midsize companies is a ripe arena for companies
such as NES to target. This traditional VAR market has made
a huge investment in technology and is facing many of the same
management problems of the Fortune 500, albeit on a smaller
scale. Forrester Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass., estimates
the market for LAN outsourcing at $782 million and growing.
Dataquest Inc. in San Jose estimates the market's growth at
100 percent annually.

Attracting larger clients usually means adhering to stricter
cost-justifications. In exploring the market possibilities
for a network management service company, NES went on a hunt
for a product that could assist the VAR in making coherent
cost-justifications for its clients.

The true cost of network management has become one of the more
perplexing X factors in corporate planning. Consultants have
estimated the average cost of network management at up to four
times the cost of the network per year. Strategic Research
Inc., Santa Barbara, Calif., recently estimated the cost of
storage management at more than $7 per Mbyte per year. This
is at a time when the cost to purchase and install 1 Mbyte
of storage capacity stands at $1.

Assessing the Cost

Unsurprisingly, a number of products have appeared on the scene
designed to assess the true cost of managing the distributed
network. Most have been too complex, too anemic or both.

NES found its answer in software from Interpose Inc. The product
C/S Solution Advisor-is a marriage of network discovery technology
and the expertise of consultancies such as Gartner Group. The
C/S Solution Advisor, which costs $495, locates the hardware
and software on a client's network through discovery. VARs
can then apply unit costs (supplied by the end user) to the
data to assess the cost of the network. To come up with the
real-life-or close to real-life-projected cost of ownership,
cost of management and return on investment calculations, market
metrics from organizations such as Gartner Group, Strategic
Research and Infonetics Research are applied.

"Oftentimes our customers cannot answer all the questions we
have about their networks. For instance, they may not know
what downtime costs them," says Reagan, NES' marketing director.
"So we assign a couple of different figures and we can then
do a couple of different ROI analyses based on those figures."

For many end users, that could be the first comprehensive assessment
done on their networks. NES employs the product as a sales
tool, offering the customer cost-justifications for its services.
"It's not that easy for companies to keep track of what they
own, so they can't be expected to always know what they are
spending on management," says Reagan. "The Interpose product
gets them to focus on costs. We use it early in the sales cycle,
and it has been very effective."

Networking: Your True Voice

By:
Cassimir Medford

The opportunity for VARs to offer clients spectacular new technology
that could slash network costs by as much as 40 percent and
pay for itself in less than a year is here. It's voice over
Frame Relay.

Customers who use Frame Relay service for data communications
can now add voice communications at almost no extra cost. It's
like buying a gadget that allows your television set to reliably
heat your home.

Motorola's VoiceRelay uses a voice compression algorithm that
lets voice share bandwidth with data and fax on a Frame Relay
connection. It supports analog and digital interfaces and is
sold with the company's 6520 MPRouter.

Voice packets are less tolerant of delays, so they get priority
over data packets. Delay negatively affects voice intelligibility.
An on-board canceller filters out echo, and an adaptive algorithm
stabilizes delays and recovers packets. Per-port pricing for
VoiceRelay starts at $750. (For a free demonstration of VoiceRelay,
call [508] 261-5543 between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m.)

In addition, Micom has integrated voice capabilities into its
NetRunner and Marathon products. Like VoiceRelay, Micom's Frame
Relay software gives priority to voice packets. Voice is carried
at or below the committed information rate with other traffic
on top. If a voice packet is dropped, the software will compensate
by replaying the previous packet.

Also, Micom introduced FrameRunner, a T-1 concentrator that
supports up to eight T-1 links. It supports up to 250 nodes
with integrated voice, fax, data and LAN traffic. The eight
port device is $8,500 and the four-port is $6,500.

Voice over Frame Relay has potential gotchas. The first is voice
quality. Delay compensation techniques have some impact on
voice quality. If the customer is used to 64-Kbit/s long-haul
quality voice, then voice over Frame Relay will require some
adjustment. If the customer is used to compressed voice communication,
then voice over Frame Relay will be suitable. Voice over Frame
Relay can put customers at the mercy of telephone service providers,
however-pricing policies can be changed with the stroke of
a pen.

Networking -- What VARs Are Saying: Know Who's In Charge

By:
Cassimir Medford

Corporate politics exist in every organization. Do you try to
stay aware of the political boundaries that prevail at your
client sites? Do corporate politics work to your advantage
or disadvantage?

We absolutely stay abreast of the politics at our client sites.
It is important that we know who is in charge of the company's
strategic direction, who has purchasing power and who doesn't.
You've got to know whether or not you're dealing with the right
people inside a company.

You have to have a certain degree of sensitivity to the personalities
that make up a company. There are people within these organizations
who have their life's capital invested in the mainframe and
the glass house, and if you're not cognizant of that person's
needs and basic insecurities, you're not going to be successful
in your effort to promote your favorite technology throughout
that organization.

It's a very delicate thing we do. You don't win the game if
every time you go out you make one friend and one enemy. It's
a zero-sum game that way.

It's imperative that you stay aware of the politics at a client
site. I don't mean that we get involved in it. You've got to
know who the decision-makers are. That can make your job much
easier. There is a lot of change happening in the business
world. Companies are going through mergers, buyouts and partnerships,
so you've got to know who is in charge.

Software: Building a Warehouse -- More data and more disparate systems
make it a great VAR market

By:
Ian Jacobs

When IBM began pushing the idea of data warehouses in the late
'80s, customers were justifiably wary. Many saw the new technology,
which was touted as a way to move their decision support needs
away from their operational databases, as little more than
a way for IBM to move more big iron and more copies of DB2.

Times certainly have changed. Within the last year, there has
been an explosion in the number of data warehousing projects.
Most of those have been undertaken by Fortune 500 companies.
But not only the big guys are jumping into the fray. Changing
market pressures and price/performance ratios make data warehousing
more affordable for smaller companies. All of those changes
spell opportunity for VARs, as long as they don't rush blindly
into the new field. Since the business is so young, pitfalls
await the unwary. But for those who learn the ropes, the profit
potential is huge.

The list of vendors hawking wares for the data warehousing market
grows almost daily. SAS Institute, Oracle, Sybase, Informix,
Intersolv, IBM, AT&T and Red Brick Systems are among those
selling data warehousing tools. That level of interest is no
surprise. According to Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn., the
market for data warehousing totaled $1.5 billion last year.
By 1999, Gartner predicts the market will be just shy of $7
billion.

Data warehouses add up to more than the sum of their many parts.
The goal of data warehouses is to ensure that companies get
the most information possible out of all their accumulated
data without interfering with the day-to-day operations of
their businesses. To achieve that, VARs combine their database
integration expertise with front-end tools such as specialized
query tools; analytical engines built around multidimensional
databases; storage spaces in relational databases; transformation
tools that extract the desired data from operational systems;
and numerous other tools that tailor projects to customers'
needs, such as security and backup software. The average size
of one of those projects, according to the Meta Group in Westport,
Conn., hovers near $3 million.

Clearly, data warehousing has the potential to bring tidy profits
and high margins, especially if you can get in early. But not
every VAR has the skill set needed for those projects. Data
warehousing projects last an average of three years, according
to the Meta Group. In addition, they use every ounce of energy
you can muster.

Smaller data warehousing projects-commonly called data marts
require at least two special skill sets, while full-sized projects
require at least three. For any data warehousing projects,
VARs need to have outstanding database administration skills
because data warehouses are essentially enormous databases.
The second crucial requirement is industry-specific knowledge,
which gives you an enormous boost in your sales pitch. You
need not only to be able to put the data together, but also
to tell the customer which data to select in the first place.

For the more traditional monstrous undertakings, a third skill
is required. "You also need tremendous connectivity skills,"
says Neal Hill, vice president of marketing at Cognos Inc.,
which sells front-end query tools for data warehouses. "What
you're likely to be building is a platform that integrates
data from lots of different sources."

Target Your Market

If you lack the resources to organize and implement large projects,
focus on the growing number of companies looking for data marts.
Small companies often need the same access to information that
their larger competitors enjoy, so they make prime candidates
for smaller data warehousing projects. Another set of targets
you can hone in on are departments within large organizations
that want their own data marts separate from the larger corporate
databases.

The theory behind data marts is relatively simple. Hill says
data warehouses are on too large a scale for the average business
computer user. "I don't get things from a warehouse in the
real world; I get them from the neighborhood convenience store,"
Hill explains. "I don't want to deal with forklift loads; I
want to deal with armloads at a time."

One of the reasons data marts and data warehouses in general
are becoming more attractive to customers is the lowering costs
of all of the pieces involved in data warehousing solutions
and the increasing returns they generate.

"The price points in the marketplace with some of the Intel
hardware, Windows NT and the workgroup servers are very, very
attractive," says Steve Miller, senior director of the open
client-server practice at the Braun Technology Group. Braun,
a Chicago-based integrator, creates data warehouses using databases
from Oracle and query and reporting tools from Business Objects
Inc. "It is a very inexpensive way to get some incredible information."

Miller points to competitive advantage as the main driving force
behind the boom in data warehouses. If you can get that advantage
at a lower cost, so much the better for your profit/loss statement.

"Customers believe the market is saying, 'You need to do it
because your competitors are doing it,' " Miller says. "They
have this wealth of legacy information and they're using it
to get information about the market that they're going to use
against you. If you don't do it, you're going to be left out
in the cold."

Partner For Profit

So far, the data warehouse market has been dominated by a few
of the super integrators and the consulting businesses of the
vendors that sell the tools. Making your way into this market
may require cooperation with one of those more established
players.

"I don't know of many integrators who can pull these things
together out of the box," says Robert Scheier, senior analyst
at the Hurwitz Consulting Group, Newton, Mass. "You have to
partner with people who have been successful and protect yourself
from going it on your own."

Jeffrey Coombs, director of channels at query tool vendor Business
Objects, agrees. He warns VARs that they aren't likely to get
the big deals right away. "It's the Ernst & Youngs and the
Andersens that are going to do the million-dollar projects."

A better way for VARs to approach the market is to join forces
with vendors and even big integrators. "The Big Six aren't
in the business of doing the coding themselves, so if a VAR
has the expertise in doing that, he'll be able to build a business,"
advises Coombs. "Develop the expertise in implementing tools
like ours and provide a service to the customer and to the
large integrator who doesn't want to deal with that part of
the project."

Another factor you need to consider before rushing headlong
into data warehousing can be summed up in one word: Politics.
Since the projects are multiyear deals with costs frequently
running into seven figures, organizational politics become
a key factor in the success of these endeavors.

You need a sponsor high up in the company who will support you
through the entire development process. This can be one of
the thorniest political issues you'll have to deal with. Bill
Gannon Jr., vice president at Westboro, Mass.-based Sentry
Market Research, sees two groups at cross-purposes in each
customer who commits to a data warehouse: the centralized IS
group and the decentralized departmental users.

When the political problems are really bad, nothing gets done.
Sid Banerjee, MicroStrategy's director of western operations,
tells of a customer that makes all of its technology decisions
through a corporate standards board. "They're so concerned
that they pick the best set of tools that they've been stuck
in this analysis paralysis for nine months. They're looking
at every tool under the sun," Banerjee says. "They're not moving
forward because they don't have a key user sponsor saying,
'I want a solution to this specific problem right now'."

Banerjee says that to ease such political hassles, you should
seek out strong corporate sponsorship at the user level while
also getting strong implementation sponsorship at the IS level.

The notion that data warehouses are an ongoing process can also
trip up some VARs. Don't expect to go in, set up the warehouse
and get out. Once the warehouse is up and running, then the
real work begins.

"You shouldn't go in with the idea that you're going to get
it 99.9 percent right, because that's not possible," says Miller.
"Take your best shot, build in the expectation that it's going
to change and build in the flexibility to allow that change
to happen."-o

Software: PEN COMPUTING -- PENTt Up Demand?

By:
Ian G. Jacobs

To paraphrase Mark Twain, the reports of the death of pen computing
are greatly exaggerated. True, you no longer hear pundits predicting
a Newton in every home. But VARs are making a tidy income creating
vertical applications.

Bob Gressler, president of Computers At Work, a Parsippany,
N.J., mobile computing VAR, predicted that millions of pen
based computers would rush out of computer superstores. Still,
he says the new realities don't bother him.

"Our real goal was to find markets where there wasn't lots of
competition," Gressler recalls. His company now sells mobile
solutions to public utilities, the compressed gas industry
and law enforcement agencies.

Although the public doesn't hear about pen-based applications
anymore, that doesn't mean the market has dried up. Seth Rosenberg,
consulting manager at Cone Software Inc. in Boothwyn, Pa.,
says that although pen computing has a bad reputation for horizontal,
consumer applications, "it doesn't have a nothing reputation
for the vertical markets."

Portable devices haven't died either. Fremont, Calif.-based
PenRight! Corp. recently released PenRight! for Windows, a
new Windows development environment.

Gressler is unconvinced of the need for the Windows product.
He says DOS applications are easier to use. "You can't give
a truck driver Windows," he says.

"Our competition isn't other VARs. [It] comes from in-house
groups who want to write the systems themselves," he adds.
"We're integrators, and we're one-stop shopping. We sell the
hardware, we stage it and we install it. The real key is integration."

So, while pen-based applications have lost much of their glitzy
appeal, don't count them out. Resellers willing to plumb the
depths of the wireless world may find an uncrowded niche with
high demand and savvy customers-a VAR's dream.

Software: Software VAR -- Direct Marketing 101

By:
Ian G. Jacobs

If you're like most software VARs, direct marketing probably
isn't the first method you use to garner new business. But
direct mail pieces can help you increase sales.

It isn't enough to just slap together a quick brochure in PageMaker
and mail it out randomly. Targeted mailing lists, special language
and effective page design will all combine to give you a potent
direct marketing campaign.

Start with the mailing list. If your software works with a vendor's
product, you probably already enjoy good relations with that
vendor, so exploit it.

"What software VARs should first do is call up their buddies
at the mothership and say, 'I want the list in my neighborhood,'"
says Bill Mirbach, chairman of Mirbach & Co. Inc., a Westport,
Conn., direct marketing agency. "Goal number one is to get
those names. Goal two is to mail to them on a regular basis."

To make creating convincing easier, Mirbach & Co. offers a pamphlet
called 99 Tips for Software Direct Marketing that you can get
by calling (203) 221-5200.

Some of the tips in the pamphlet seem obvious, but others are
less apparent. Mirbach says that whenever you mail anything
even if it's not sales pitch material-always include an offer.
"If you're paying for the stamp, try and get some money back."

Mirbach stresses that your pitch should read like a conversational
letter. To test your prose, read it to someone.

If you need additional help, Mirbach counsels VARs to ensure
that mailings don't end up in the trash. His staff will write
your copy, merge/purge your mailing list and even go to the
printer to make sure they are printing your job properly.

The tip that business people often find the hardest to swallow,
Mirbach says, is: "Direct marketing is a 'How' business, not
a 'Why' business. Track results, then repeat your successes.
Worry about why it worked later."

"You have a choice. You either get over it or you just go into
an endless Do loop," Mirbach says. "It is a basic agreement
that you absolutely have to have about the nature of reality.
If you don't have that, you're not going to do well with direct
marketing."

Computer Telephony: Ringing Up Small Business -- Low-cost telephony 
products offer fast payback for VARs

By:
Hillary Rettig

If one of your New Year's resolutions is to start selling computer
telephone integration solutions to your small business customers,
congratulations. You're getting in ahead of the pack, and you
stand to profit handsomely.

Of course, you've got to do it right. CTI, like any new technology,
can be tricky to sell to small business. It's unfamiliar, and
it can also be expensive. And even those customers who are
ready and waiting for it may wonder why they should buy it
from a VAR instead of their telephone company.

Below, you'll find four CTI strategies that answer those arguments.
They're familiar, nonthreatening and inexpensive, and they
offer a relatively quick return-on-investment.

Add a Screen Pop

Screen pop applications, in which software automatically displays
information about incoming calls, are one of the easier things
in CTI to demo, says Dennis Dintelmann, CTI sales manager at
Edwardsville, Ill.-based Scheffel & Co. Computer Services Inc.
Most popular PIMs and contact managers are already telephony
enabled. If your customer is using one, add a telephony middleware
program to gain access to screen pops, call screening and a
PC-based telephone.

Aurora Systems Inc.'s FastCall stands out among the middleware
packages in that it requires no programming. Once FastCall
is installed, for example, you can configure it to ring your
telephone when a customer calls, but route all other calls
to voicemail. FastCall costs $300 to $600 per desktop, depending
on the functionality required.

There are dozens of products that offer a PC-based telephone
and other telephony applications. Some offer prewritten program
modules, while others offer programming libraries and application
generators. For a user-friendly dip into telephony, you probably
want one that requires as little programming as possible.

Few of the canned telephony applications are as simple-and,
at $79, as economical-as PhoneKits by AlgoRhythms Inc. The
program contains five modules: PC Phone, Call Log, Answering
Machine, Address Book and Fax Machine. PC Phone is the heart
of the package. You can create custom telephones by dragging
and-dropping telephone buttons, keypads and other elements
onto a design grid. You can also change the appearance of buttons
and incorporate bitmapped images into the telephone's background.

Integrate Communications

While true unified messaging remains a pie-in-the-sky kind of
solution, you can easily set up your small business customers
with semiunified fax, electronic mail and voicemail. Thomas
King, president of PC Serv, a New York-based VAR, says that
just about every small business he's dealt with could use this
solution. The productivity gains are apparent, especially in
understaffed offices. It's also easy to implement in stages,
so you can do it in cases where the budget is tight, says King.

Delrina Corp.'s CommSuite may be the most comprehensive of the
many software products that combine fax, e-mail and voicemail
under an integrated front end. Other features include pager
support, MAPI support and, via the $15 TalkView add-on, voice
support. The single-user version is $99; the two-user starter
network pack is $549.95.

Build On Top of NetWare

If you're a NetWare shop, check out CallWare Technologies Inc.'s
CallWare NLM, the only CTI NLM on the market. CallWare sports
a character-based interface that is similar to NetWare's own.
"I can't tell you how many people see our screens and say,
'Hey, that looks familiar!' " says Joseph Staples, CallWare's
vice president of marketing. "It's very reassuring to them."

CallWare provides auto-attendant, voice messaging and audiotext
features. The package also includes a five-user version of
CallWare ViewPoint, a product that allows users to graphically
access messages from their desktop PCs. (Additional five-packs
cost $45.) The product is priced at $2,995 for a 25-user version.

Create Demand For Fax-On-Demand

FOD is a natural for retail businesses, customer service organizations
and others with a high call volume. It's also an easy sell,
since most customers have used an FOD system and can easily
see the benefit. Best of all, if implemented properly, FOD
requires almost no maintenance. "I get, 'how do I do it?',
not 'it's broke' calls," says one VAR.

Ibex Technologies Inc.'s FactsLine 2.0 for Windows combines
robust fax capability with a document management system optimized
for TIFF and other fax file formats. Many major vendors use
in-house FactsLine, and a client is bundled with Windows 95.

FactsLine retails for $4,790 plus $670 per inbound or outline
telephone line. You need at least two lines, one inbound and
one outbound. You'll also need a server and an industrial-strength
fax board such as the VFX-40 from Dialogic.

Once you start working with CTI, it's to your advantage to bone
up on the broader field of telecommunications. For one thing,
some of the products mentioned above work best when combined
with specific telecommunications services such as Caller ID.
For example, without Caller ID, screen pop software won't know
which information to display. At the same time, it's important
to understand the limits of the technologies-Caller ID, for
example, does not work with incoming calls from most PBXs.

Most of the products mentioned require that you hook up the
PC to a TAPI-compliant telephone or voice-enabled modem. For
new installations, purchase a new TAPI-compliant telephone,
such as the AT&T Computer Telephone 8130. For preexisting ones,
purchase an inexpensive TAPI interface box or card from the
manufacturer.

Comdial Corp. has an appealing solution for linking PCs to ordinary
analog telephones. The $99 PC and Telephone Interface (PATI)
3000 is a box that plugs into your computer's parallel port
on one end and telephone line on the other. It includes a second
parallel port so you don't lose access to your printer or other
parallel-port peripheral. PATI ships with a suite of "light"
CTI applications, including an on-screen telephone, minidialer,
address book and call log.

Most of the major modem manufacturers have released voice-enabled
modems. Connectware Inc. offers a card it says is optimized
for voice applications. PhoneWorks 28.8 ($299) uses the Rockwell
chipset, which offers the full duplex circuit necessary for
quality sound reproduction, as well as Caller ID support.

Computer Telephony: Wireless Telecom -- How One VAR Makes the MOST of Telecom

By:
Hillary Rettig

If you're a small VAR who is starting to work with new technologies,
it helps if you can approach them from a fresh perspective.
Ask Andy Sjamsu, president of Ronkonkoma, N.Y.-based Mobile
Office Solutions Technology (MOST) Inc. He started out in 1991
as a reseller specializing in contact management solutions
using Elan Software's GoldMine for Windows and has evolved
into a supplier of wireless telecommunications products and
services.

Sjamsu's new business line evolved out of his own company's
needs and those of his customers. Like many resellers, he used
the solution he sold in-house. It worked well, he says, except
for one problem: He and his colleagues, who spend more than
half of their time on the road, had trouble keeping their databases
synchronized. "It's tough getting to a telephone jack when
you're in a car."

To Sjamsu, the solution was obvious: wireless synchronization.
"We use wireless for e-mail, so it made sense that we should
be able to use it for this as well." Sjamsu developed GoldMine
Wireless Solution (GWS), an add-on that lets GoldMine users
synchronize their databases over the RAM Mobile Data two-way
wireless network.

Sjamsu has shifted his business focus from traditional reselling
to selling GWS, both direct and through the channel. "We're
getting in on the ground floor of something big," he says.
"When you see an opportunity like this, you can't let it pass
you by." He is excited not only at the prospect of selling
GWS, but also of collecting royalties from RAM Mobile based
on airtime usage related to his product.

That's the real reason VARs should pay attention to telephony
and telecom, Sjamsu says. "Everything is evolving very fast,
and there are always new and different profit opportunities."

You Can Break Through Desktop Barriers -- Connect with high
margin remote computing markets

By:
T.C. Doyle

Space may indeed be the final frontier, but not just because
vast amounts of it remain to be explored. Rather, it is the
lack of space that has computer scientists working late into
the night.

Inventors including George Gerpheide, founder and president
of Cirque Corp. in Salt Lake City, have produced a flurry of
space-saving and feature-enhancing innovations that have transformed
the world of portable computing into the world of dream computing.
When users leave their offices equipped with a notebook computer
that includes one of Gerpheide's GlidePoint pointing devices,
more often than not they are taking with them a personal computer
that offers nearly as many features-and as fast a microprocessor
as those found in the systems used by their deskbound colleagues.

VARs looking for opportunities need look no further than the
burgeoning $8 billion market for portable computers, which
is expected to expand to $10 billion by 1997, according to
Dataquest Inc., San Jose. This season alone boasts a bumper
crop of "no-compromise" notebook computers featuring space
saving enhancements that have allowed vendors to cram their
wares with clear 12.1-inch, active-matrix thin-film transistor
(TFT) screens, 1-Gbyte hard disk drives, fast 120-MHz microprocessors,
reliable 28.8-baud PCMCIA modems and long-lasting lithium-ion
batteries-features that a short while ago were available only
in exotic systems.

Dataquest analyst Mark McGuire believes advanced features that
have become the norm in top-of-the-line notebooks from NEC
Technologies, Texas Instruments, Toshiba America Information
Systems, AST Research and others will soon find their way into
product lines as early as mid-1996. And that's just the beginning.
The near future will include notebook computers that feature
150- and 180-MHz microprocessors, plus bigger screens that
boast a 1,024-x-1,280 resolution, says Ken Dulaney, vice president
of mobile computing at market research firm Gartner Group,
Stamford, Conn. More units will have removable CD-ROM drives
and wireless infrared docking capabilities.

"As mundane as it sounds, the biggest advances may come from
work to improve bus speeds," Dulaney says. "In 1996, you will
see more PCI notebooks and machines that make the most of improvements
to individual components. Once that is accomplished, videoconferencing
and other advances once considered exotic will become commonplace
on notebook computers, which have become true desktop replacements.
They are not a specialty machine anymore."

Gerpheide agrees. He convinced Apple that his space-saving GlidePoint
pointing device would not only free up real estate taken up
by a mouse, but also offer better reliability. After all, his
solid-state device has no moving parts to wear out and takes
up less than half the space of a standard mouse. Better yet,
Gerpheide says his GlidePoint, found in Apple PowerBooks and
other portable systems, will usher handwriting recognition
technology into standard portable systems. He and leading hardware
developers are working on a next-generation GlidePoint, which
resembles a flat LCD panel and can read simple annotations
and even Kanji characters.

Beyond that lie even greater advances. NEC, for example, is
working on prototype machines that have interchangeable screens
and even projection display capabilities for delivering multimedia
presentations. Canon USA, meanwhile, is working on smaller
and lighter printers that a variety of third parties will integrate
with their notebook units. Other vendors are experimenting
with collapsible screens, wireless communications solutions
and expanding keyboards that resemble IBM's now-famous TrackWrite
"butterfly" design found in ThinkPad 701 C/CS units.

One In Three PCs

So big has the notebook computer market become that 25 percent
of the PCs sold nationwide today are portable devices, according
to various industry reports. Gartner Group's Dulaney believes
that portable systems could account for more than one in three
systems sold if corporate IT executives stopped viewing notebook
computers as specialty machines. A notebook carries a 50 percent
to 100 percent price premium over a desktop computer. Last
year, Gartner Group completed a study that showed the incremental
cost of a notebook can be paid back in 100 weeks if a mobile
user works one hour per week more than a deskbound user. Considering
how feature-rich and convenient portables are today, experts
agree that's almost bound to happen.

VARs, of course, would be wise to take note of this selling
point as well as other market dynamics. Notebook computers
offer VARs such as New York-based MFJ International, a Lotus
Premier Business partner and Notes developer, the perfect vehicle
for delivering custom sales automation solutions and other
mobile applications. MFJ sells a custom-developed sales automation
package called OverQuota to notebook customers nationwide.
Other VARs, meanwhile, find notebooks to be the ideal replacement
for desktop computers at many of their customer sites. Central
Telecom, a Toshiba VAR in Overland Park, Kan., is upgrading
a national hospital sales automation company's entire base
of desktop computers with portable systems so its workers can
be more productive.

"It's clients like those that convinced us to get out of the
desktop computer market altogether and concentrate on the portable
marketplace," says Rick Pack, Central Telecom sales manager.
The gambit proved to be a smart one. Central Telecom's revenue
was expected to jump to $12 million in 1995, although the company
employs only nine people. In addition, the company is expanding
its operations to Denver at the prompting of Toshiba, which
wants a support center there on par with Central Telecom's
operations in Kansas.

Given the number of VARs promoting notebook technology, the
improved usefulness of the machines and their falling price
points, it is no wonder that sales have picked up steadily.
In 1994, the market-measured in the number of units sold-jumped
by 29.9 percent, according to BIS Strategic Decisions of Boston.
The market will grow an estimated 21.8 percent to 4.7 million
units by the time final 1995 results are tallied, BIS estimates.
By the end of the decade, sales could reach 8.1 million units.

Within the portable market, there are significant shifts under
way. For example, color notebooks now account for the bulk
of portable systems sold, outselling monochrome systems by
nearly 4 to1 in 1995. In addition, notebook and subnotebook
units account for the majority of systems sold. Though growing
at a healthy rate, subnotebooks are not expected to overtake
notebook sales this decade, according to BIS. If anything,
the desire for bigger screens and full-size keyboards are keeping
alive the market for bigger notebooks. "By adopting bigger
screens, vendors have gone international in scope, dumping
the 8.5-inch-x-11.5-inch form factor in favor of the bigger
A4 size," says Gartner Group's Dulaney. "Where units are getting
smaller, however, is in thickness, thanks to GlidePoint and
things like 12-mm disk drives."

It Keeps Growing And Growing...

Technology aside, the market is also expanding as vendors approach
it for the first time or with renewed vigor. For example, at
the Fall Comdex trade show, notebook newcomer Hitachi PC Corp.
showed off its new line of Pentium-powered systems, while others
vowed to mount a comeback. That group included Unisys, Epson
America, Everex Systems and Samsung Electronics America. Though
behind technically, Samsung hopes to catch up in July with
a new 120-MHz-powered SENS 810 notebook. The unit will feature
removable hard drives plus Samsung's own 11.3-inch TFT screen.

Back in early 1994, Toshiba climbed to the top of the market
and has remained the No. 1 supplier ever since, according to
Dataquest. Though year-end figures for 1995 are not yet available,
the market has not shifted appreciably from year-end 1994 when
Toshiba finished with a 19 percent share. IBM, thanks to its
popular ThinkPad family of products, ranked second with a 12
percent market share. Compaq, Apple Computer and NEC round
out the rest of the top-tier vendors, which collectively accounted
for half the volume shipments in portable systems in 1994 and
1995.

The stranglehold the top-tier vendors have on the market may
be broken in 1996 as second-tier vendors rally. According to
a recent Gartner Group report, tier-two vendors including AST,
Hewlett-Packard, AT&T, Digital Equipment and others are "on
par with tier one in financial stability and are beginning
to rival or in some cases exceed tier-one vendors in quality
assurance, technology innovation and breadth of product line."
Not surprisingly, a price war among top players broke out last
fall. IBM, for example, initiated a price promotion that saved
customers as much as $650 when they purchased a ThinkPad 755
model. Among other things, IBM offered buyers a copy of Lotus
SmartSuite CD, a $399 value.

Regardless of the savings, VARs considering adding another product
line would do well to consider tier-two vendors, Gartner Group
concludes. Central Telecom, for one, is adding Texas Instruments'
TravelMate line to its product portfolio. Sales manager Pack
says the company needs a second line because Toshiba systems
are often on allocation. "You have to drop the name of a big
customer to get Toshiba products," he says, "so we are hoping
that a full-featured line like the TI will fit the bill."

Texas Instruments was one of several vendors that redefined
the high end of portable computing this fall with the introduction
of a 120-MHz, Pentium-based model. TI's $5,199 TravelMate 5200
has 8 Mbytes of memory, a 1.2-Gbyte hard disk, a 10.4-inch
active-matrix super VGA screen and two lithium-ion battery
packs. A similarly equipped Versa unit from NEC sells for roughly
$5,499, as does AST's new Ascentia 950N product, which starts
at $5,249. So competitive has the high-end performance segment
become that Toshiba chose for the first time not to release
pricing when it unveiled its new Tecra 700 series in October
until it shipped the new products in late November.

Toshiba wants the new high-end Tecra series to stand out because
of its features, not necessarily its aggressive price, according
to the company's senior product manager Steve Brehaut. "IBM
gets a lot of attention for its butterfly-design ThinkPad,
but we like to remind the competition that we are No. 1 for
our technology," says Brehaut. "We were the first to market
with a Pentium-based notebook, lithium-ion batteries and units
that use PCI in docking stations and other innovations. We
provide flexibility and cutting-edge technology first. That's
what keeps us on top." That and a loyal following among many
VARs in the channel.

When Toshiba decided to authorize roughly 20 different companies
to perform service repairs, VARs including Computer Systems
& Solutions of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., jumped into high gear. "When
Toshiba opened the door for us to do service, we changed our
business model," says company chief executive Kimberly Crew.

NEC is trying to cultivate deeper ties to VARs, too. Dale Fuller,
vice president of portable systems at NEC in Mountain View,
Calif., says the company is working with a number of VARs on
various projects including trying to develop a custom joy stick
that will serve as a portable gaming device. Another is working
on adapting an 8-mm DAT drive to fit inside a Versa notebook
computer.

"We have VARs that are making our products very 'verticalized,'"
says Fuller. "Some are working with different operating systems,
helping us take our 2000 and 4000 product lines into new customer
segments."

NEC introduced the 4000 series in July and added the 4080H to
the lineup in late October. It boasts "on-demand" modularity
similar to that in Toshiba's Tecra line. The Versa 4080H has
a slot for a second battery or CD-ROM drive or additional hard
disk. Like other top-of-the-line units, it features two stereo
speakers, two infrared ports for cable-free file exchange and
docking, plus two stacked PC card slots for Type II or Type
III adapters. That feature set is turning up in more than just
TravelMates, ThinkPads, Ascentias and Tecras. Compaq's latest
LTE 5000 family, which ranges in price from $3,999 to $6,699,
also boasts a modular design and can accommodate a CD-ROM drive,
a 1.35-Gbyte hard disk, a 3.5-inch diskette drive plus a Pentium
120-MHz microprocessor. In addition, the Compaq LTEs feature
stereo speakers, integrated Ethernet support and an infrared
port for wireless printing, file transfer and drive synchronization.
One selling point: Compaq LTE 5000s were selected by Microsoft's
field sales force for demonstrating Windows 95 and Office 95
to large customers.

Not to be outdone, IBM is bouncing back with its new ThinkPad
760 series. The units feature a 12.1-inch TFT screen, a 120
MHz Pentium chip and a unique tilt-up keyboard and MPEG-2 video
playback capabilities. With IBM's UltraBay design, users can
swap-in and swap-out a variety of modules such as a CD-ROM
drive.

"Those new 12.1-inch units will be sold primarily as desktop
replacements, less as systems for sales force automation,"
maintains Per Larsen, director of worldwide brand management
of mobile computing at IBM in Research Triangle Park, N.C.

Larsen suggests that early adopters including mobile workers
who buy the first couple of hundred thousand full-featured
760 units are not the target audience for the 760. "The mobile
workforce is very large, but desktop replacement is a much
bigger market," he concedes. "That's why we have paid so much
attention to multimedia and docking capabilities. For example,
all ThinkPads have infrared technology, and 30 percent of our
systems sell with a docking station. When you buy an IBM, you
don't have to update the docking system every time you buy
a new machine. Not too many others can say that."

Future ThinkPads, he says, may include chips other than Intel
microprocessors because "the Pentium doesn't fit well into
certain market sweet-spots" such as the $2,200 to $2,400 market
segment.

IBM's new ThinkPad has the increasingly popular lithium-ion
batteries that have plagued at least one major vendor. When
Apple first introduced its PowerBook 5300 model, several units
caught fire. Apple has resumed shipping the 5300 with nickel
metal-hydride batteries and promises customers that the product
is safe. More than that, Apple is banking on its VAR partners
to embrace its new PowerPC-powered systems. To help spur sales,
Apple reduced by $100 the price of the 5300, which is a whole
pound lighter than Apple's previous top-of-line PowerBook 500
series. The systems include 8 Mbytes of RAM and can accommodate
a 10.4-inch color active-matrix screen and two slots that can
accommodate industry standard add-in cards. The removable floppy
drive can be replaced with an additional hard drive or AC power
adapter among other devices.

"You read a lot about vendors that are known for their technology
leadership. But the real tale of the tape is how many they
ship," says Charlie Tritschler, PowerBook product line manager.
"We have jumped into the top five, according to the most recently
available data, because we are shipping innovations customers
want, not features that people think are just 'cool.'

Another vendor trying to make a leap into the top five is Sharp
Electronics Corp. Though its products are competitive, Sharp
admits its ties to VARs are weak. Among other things, Sharp
brings to the market award-winning screen technology, and the
company is one of the world's largest suppliers of TFT screens.
Dataquest says Sharp could double or even triple its 12.1-inch
active-matrix screen output in 1996. The company is rolling
out several Pentium-based systems, including the high-end Sharp
9070 system that includes 16 Mbytes of RAM, a 28.8-baud voice
data/fax modem, a PCI motherboard, a lithium-ion battery and
a removable quad-speed CD-ROM drive.

The package resembles that of AST, which is trying to break
from the middle of the pack. Its recently unveiled Ascentia
950N weighs only 6 pounds, but may be just the right amount
to tip the scales back in AST's favor after a long malaise.

Gartner Group's report on the notebook market sums it up: "There
is now a significantly broader set of vendors to choose from."
Just the thing for a channel that wants more options.

Ultimate Solution -- Connecting the Road Warrior

By:
T.C. Doyle

As advanced as the technology inside one of today's top-of-the
line notebook computers is, more often than not it is the technology
outside the box that makes a solution complete. Per Larsen,
director of worldwide brand management of mobile computing
solutions at IBM's PC Co. in Research Triangle Park, N.C.,
says wireless infrared technology is the hidden jewel in ThinkPad
technology. "Every one of our ThinkPads supports infrared,
allowing them to take advantage of innovations such as Extended
Systems wireless LAN adapters," he says. "They allow a user
to connect to a network by simply lining up his computer with
an outlet in a wall. That's great stuff."

VARs familiar with the Extended Systems' JetEye products agree.
Early last year, the company joined IBM's ThinkPad Proven Program
when its JetEye family became one of the first infrared adapters
to let IBM ThinkPad owners use their notebook's built-in infrared
communications port. In November, the company unveiled a $399
option for connecting users to NetWare, TCP/IP and NetBIOS
networks and printers by simply placing their infrared-equipped
portable near the JetEye Net Plus access node.

Wireless communications have made big leaps in reliability and
usability. Last month Megahertz was slated to ship its new
AllPoints Wireless PC Card ($499). Among other things, users
can receive electronic mail, transmit faxes, and access databases
and various online services.

If wireless is too exotic for your customer, then consider a
PCMCIA-based modem. Companies providing full-feature modems
include Microcom Inc., Ositech Communications Inc., Hayes Microcomputer
Products Inc., Practical Peripherals, Motorola and Megahertz
Corp. Remote software is also becoming a bigger part of mobile
computing. MobileWare Corp. has an architecture for managing
wireless communications. Its products include the MobileWare
Command Center for systems administration and management, plus
the MobileWare Transaction Management System that can guarantee
data integrity through authentication and encryption.

Other solutions include applications for connecting mobile workers
to wireless services. Motorola's AirApparent software connects
Windows NT users to their Motorola Tango pager-toting colleagues
in the field. Socket Communications Inc.'s PageCard Wireless
Messaging Systems lets users plug pager cards directly into
PCMCIA slots on notebooks, allowing messages to be received
in the field. Socket's new GPS Card lets users communicate
with orbiting Global Position System satellites that provide
instant geographic data.

Proxima Corp.'s Projector 2810 accommodates both computer and
video output, is Mac- and VGA-compatible and delivers 640-x
480 resolution at 300 lumens. At $7,495, it could be just the
ticket for closing that deal for you and your client.

Availability Concerns -- Why Are Compaq Servers So Hard To Get?

By:
Tom Farre

Why Are Compaq Servers So Hard To Get?

According to VARBusiness' Annual Report Card survey, Compaq
had availability problems in 1994-1995.

Cooley: [In 3Q], there were more opportunities than we captured,
which gets back to the availability issue, as voiced appropriately
by VARs in your Annual Report Card issue.

In servers, we grossly underestimated 2Q and 3Q demand. We've
been scrambling to recoup; we've radically increased our forecast,
so we now have more components. We shipped a significant number
of servers, but our fourth quarter plans call for double the
supply vs. the second quarter.

VB: Was availability a problem for VARs only?

Cooley: No. Because VARs source these days from the likes of
Tech Data, Merisel and Ingram and, frankly, from aggregators
such as MicroAge, that is not an issue.

VB: Those are high-priority customers?

Cooley: Sure. Because our server line's breadth is so wide,
you get the channel having 75-MHz Pentium servers in stock
waiting for demand. The VAR is saying, "I want 100 MHz," and
now he'll say, "I want 133 MHz." That's how you get the wrong
balance to meet the demand. Then the VAR says, "I can't get
Compaq servers," but there are lots of Compaq servers to sell,
just the wrong damn ones.

Business Interview: Compaq Pushes Beyond the PC -- On top for now, 
Ross Cooley aims to keep Compaq there by moving agressively into the 
enterprise

By:
Tom Farre

Compaq and Ross A. Cooley have come a long way together. As
senior vice president and general manager of North America
at the biggest PC maker, Cooley oversees sales, service, support,
pricing, distribution and customer satisfaction for the United
States and Canada. That accounts for many customers and sales
roughly half of Compaq's projected $14 billion revenue for
1995.

Sales is where Cooley got his start 29 years ago at IBM. In
1984, Compaq's second year, he joined Compaq to manage the
territory east of the Mississippi, which had a team of four
salespeople. But with the June 1984 introduction of the Deskpro,
he moved to headquarters in Houston and has been in executive
management ever since.

Through the years, Cooley has ridden the wave of Compaq's technology
leadership, when it introduced the first 386 desktop PC in
1986 and the first superserver, the Systempro, in 1989. As
Compaq's most visible channel executive, he also helped craft
and promote Compaq's successful reseller-only distribution
strategy. That was until 1991, when-responding to its first
quarterly loss-Compaq broadened its distribution and started
working directly with users.

Known as a tough but fair competitor, Cooley is no stranger
to controversy. He was instrumental in Compaq's famous deauthorization
of BusinessLand, and more recently in the disagreement with
Intel regarding the "Intel Inside" campaign, which Cooley believes
devalues the Compaq brand.

Today Cooley has his hands full as Compaq tries to stay on top
by expanding on all fronts, from consumer electronics to the
enterprise. Of special interest to VARs is Compaq's push into
global client-server computing. In addition to introducing
an aggressive lineup of high-end Pentium systems, Compaq is
partnering with Digital Equipment as its worldwide service
provider. The company also has announced plans to acquire internetworking
vendors Thomas-Conrad and NetWorth. VARBusiness executive editor
Tom Farre caught up with Cooley in Houston during Compaq's
Innovate 95 convention.

VARBusiness: When Compaq had reseller-only distribution, you
were known as an advocate for the channel. Is that still true
today?

Cooley: I've been beat up pretty good [laughs]. You bet. The
Compaq strategy encompasses strong relationships and partnerships
with those who represent us. Whatever they're called this week
the retail channel, VAR, independent software vendor-we're
still very dependent on a highly motivated group of partners
to carry our message to the market and make our customers satisfied.

Now, we've done a lot since 1991 to convince the customer that
our partners and our strategy are capable of meeting their
needs, and at times the message gets confused, because it's
changed.

I'll never forget this example, when we put in an 800 number
for customers to call us for service...

VB: Instead of their resellers.

Cooley: You bet. So everybody said, "Cooley's gone native. Cooley's
lost his marbles. What the hell is he doing? That's a profit
center for us." Well, lo and behold, more customers became
convinced that we were serious about them being satisfied.
There are still reseller and service-provider hotlines and
help desks in place, and they're making money at it. So we
figured out a way to complement one another that makes the
overall result a better solution, if you will, as it relates
to the Compaq brand.

VB: In our Annual Report Card issue, Compaq received a relatively
low score in managing channel conflict.

Cooley: It's a hell of a challenge for anybody that's got more
than one pipe into the market. And the more channels you have,
the bigger the challenge is to try to keep them all separate.
Although there's incremental opportunity associated with reaching
specific customer segments, there's clearly a frustration on
behalf of all of your partners when any overlapping occurs.
And I can't-nobody can-keep it clean.

Frequently, though, those surveys reveal a perception, not a
reality. As an example, a VAR answering that survey in June
perceives that the guy who stole his customer with a 4500 Prolinea
rack mount has better access to our servers than he or she
does, and, therefore, if we hadn't authorized that [reseller]
and so on. So during times of great demand and limited supply,
we hear more frequently about channel conflict than when we're
all in stock and can all compete on a level playing field.

VB: Looking out into 1996, are you working on any initiatives
to help your resellers sell Compaq?

Cooley: I've been asked what worries me at night; one thing
is our ability to reengineer Compaq for the size it is today
and will be tomorrow. And the reengineering effort is a long
effort. It requires changing our business process first and
then our information systems to support the new business process.
A lot of frustrations that your readers have are affiliated
with old business processes, old information management (IM)
systems built for a far smaller business than we are today.

We're converting Compaq from a build-to-forecast company to
a build-to-order one. The ramifications of that, as it relates
to reducing the frustrations of the VAR community, are significant,
because when we really have build-to-order in 1996, VARs won't
have to worry about where to source Compaq solutions. And,
frankly, the entire pipeline can remove a lot of dead investment
in inventory waiting for demand. It will sit with Compaq. We're
not going to build it until they signal (see "Availability
Concerns")

VB: You can move that quickly?

Cooley: You bet. So the goal in 1996 will be, starting with
servers, converting from a build-to-forecast company to a build
to-order one, and have the ability within 48 hours to configure
and ship a product as the VAR wants it. Now, I'll grant you
there are still a number of third-party products that need
to be configured with ours to meet the total needs of the customer,
the total solution. The VAR's value, clearly, is in marrying
up the Compaq pieces with complementary products, and then
successfully installing it all at the customer site.

VB: Build-to-order should be good for margins.

Cooley: That would be great for margins. The points associated
with us parking our stuff in these warehouses all over the
United States and Canada waiting on demand is mind-boggling.
We tried to address it with programs like flooring the systems,
but if you wring that out of there, we can use the savings
to generate more demand, we can take it to the shareholders,
we can hire more systems engineers to support the VARs.

VB: You mentioned the extra products beyond the PC that make
up the total solutions VARs are putting together. What's Compaq's
role in enterprisewide solutions?

Cooley: When you walk into a glass house today and see all the
brand names required to meet the needs of the enterprise customer,
you start to see, obviously, routers and hubs and much more.
Compaq is being asked by our customers to have more accountability
for a greater number of the products needed to make this client
server world work. So whether it's alliances or a Compaq brand,
you'll see us reach out into the world of datacom to address
the requirements of that kind of a customer.

The traditional IM customer who used to buy from that vertically
integrated model [such as IBM] is looking for as much of that
as he can find in this new world. It's never going to be like
it was, but the more of it we can do, the more likely it is
that the customer will accept the VAR's recommendation that
Compaq can do this piece, this piece and this piece.

We don't intend ever to have a Compaq hardware platform, a Compaq
operating system, a Compaq application sitting on top of it.
But we will take best-in-class companies who provide that and
try to expedite and, if you will, improve the security and
reliability when they're configured with Compaq by the VAR.
We're going to try to find all those opportunities we can.

VB: Such as your CD-ROM that helps install an Oracle database?

Cooley: Exactly.

VB: You run ads saying, "With Compaq you can start up Oracle
easier," aimed at the MIS person. Should VARs be concerned
that this devalues them?

Cooley: If that were the only thing the VAR was doing, boy,
I'd be concerned. But that is not the only thing the VAR does.
When you count the number of hours and the amount of manpower
VARs dedicate to installing something like Oracle, just getting
it on there and fixed, it's absolute dead time. We want to
increase the productivity of those systems engineers employed
by the VARs to where they can get on the front end of this
thing and design new systems or plan the capacities of future
upgrades. Such activities have a higher ROI than the grunt
work of sitting there watching all these damn diskettes chugging.

VB: So it's a utility for the VAR as well?

Cooley: Yeah, it increases everybody's productivity. And the
customer's confidence level increases because of the cooperation
between the VAR and, in this case, Compaq.

VB: You just announced that you're buying Thomas-Conrad, a networking
manufacturer. What's the reasoning there?

Cooley: Today's products aren't nearly as interesting as what's
getting ready for the market. In the world of switches, they've
got some differentiated technology. So you'll see us now do
both partnering as well as, selectively, some acquisitions.

VB: Are you concerned that you're moving into a highly competitive
field that could dilute the focus of the company?

Cooley: You bet. But it's a risk, and it goes with change. As
an example, there was a concern that we would not do well in
the consumer market. And we didn't have a core competency there.
With growth, though, you can attract the talent necessary to
add a core competency along the way. So now Doug Pushard [vice
president in the Internetworking Products Group] has the skill
set necessary to manage the networking business. What Doug
will do, obviously, is add a group of people who currently
work at Thomas-Conrad. So Compaq's core competency expands.

VB: Could you envision authorizing Compaq internetworking-only
VARs?

Cooley: We are again on the verge of needing to really understand
whether or not hard product segmentation is required in order
to meet the needs of this technology. For example, [working
with Tandem Computer] we are now looking at clustered solutions.
And frankly, Tom, you and I both know that everybody authorized
to represent Compaq is not going to have an ability to begin
to spell it, let alone sell it.

So, yes, that level of solution will clearly motivate us in
1996 to once again rethink whether a subset of authorized partners
should represent us for those products. As difficult as that
is to administer, the capability and expertise required by
the customer with this level of product motivates you to want
to head down that path. I'm not there yet, or Compaq's not
there yet. But we probably have a couple of quarters to work
through it. It is a high priority for us.

VB: One stormy partnership that got a lot of press this past
year was yours with Intel. I sense the relationship has warmed
of late.

Cooley: I guess the best way to say it is that we understand
one another. And clearly we're their largest customer again.
Therefore, it's-what did Noorda call it? The world of coopetition.
They're doing some things we'd prefer they didn't, but we understand
their strategy. And I'm sure that in the future we will again
do some things they'd wish we didn't. But they will understand
our strategy.

All of us still believe that if it's closed, it's bad; if it's
open, it's good. If there are two, it's better than one from
a choice standpoint. Inevitably, we find that technology evolves
quicker; prices are better; the value, if you will, is better
if there's competition. You bet we've got a strong relationship
with AMD, Cyrix and NexGen, and you're darned right we're going
to test Alpha until it's blue in the face.

VB: You recently announced Digital Equipment as your global
service provider. How will this affect VARs?

Cooley: This change, like so many others, is driven by customer
request and requirement. The service capability of the VAR
community, as well as many other Compaq-authorized partners
in the U.S. and Canada, has continued to improve, increase
and evolve, and to a great degree they have met all the needs
of the customer. Where it continues to be a challenge is with
customers considering multinational or global implementation.
The more client-server they do, the more mission-critical they
do, then the larger this requirement becomes.

We've provided an answer for VARs that have the chance to extend
their Compaq solutions beyond the local area where they have
no service coverage. Frankly, we have lost large opportunities
to the legacy companies because they have a worldwide infrastructure,
and we've had white spots on the map where our authorized partner
had no answer. Now, with Digital's multivendor service capability,
they have a global presence. The VAR now has a product to recommend
to that multinational customer that will satisfy the customer's
requirement, as opposed to just letting the sale go to a competitor
with the infrastructure.

Now, it is on servers only, which is where the complexity is.
We didn't hear this requirement when it was portables, desktops
or personal productivity tools. But when we started to get
into this mission-critical, client-server business enterprisewide,
it became a big issue. This is a resolution to it.

VB: Digital competes for the same customers, though. You're
comfortable with that?

Cooley: Yes. It is obvious that was one of the larger issues
we considered. As [Digital CEO] John Palmer said three years
ago, they had to go find incremental revenue and profit opportunities,
because their core business wasn't doing well. Digital has
convinced us that they have built a firewall between the sales
organization and the multivendor service organization. And
we tested this 40 times if we tested it once, with customers
as well as with the channel.

You'll find every now and then people make mistakes. But they
are very quick to rectify them, because they know that if they
lose our trust and confidence, then they lose our business.
This agreement has one-year renewal options. And if it becomes
a huge conflict because the firewall has holes in it, then
there's a lot to lose, and they know it. They are already providing
service for some of our competitors and they're already, frankly,
providing service and support for some of the VARs who don't
have the capabilities. So we had a lot of good places to check
as to whether they can really separate church and state, and
they seem to be quite successful at it.

I'm never one to feed the enemy, so to speak. But we buy Toshiba
screens, we buy memory from Samsung, we buy drives from HP
and IBM. I mean, this industry is worldwide; this is truly
one of a variety of different relationships that are necessary
to have the best-of-breed products.

VB: What's your personal challenge for the year?

Cooley: Regaining portable leadership is very important in 1996.
The biggest challenge is recapturing the confidence and respect
from the customer community with our portable lineup. We made
a good step with the new LTE5000, because that thing is a home
run; it's in good shape. But the volume of the portable business
is done below that.

The opportunity is to have a wireless, mobile client that truly
meets the requirements of the user-not a personal assistant
device, but truly a full-function, wireless portable at the
right price point, with the right feature set. I think we can
get there before the rest of them, but we're not there yet,
so it is the kind of thing I worry about.

Are you Ready for Some Teamwork? -- Everyone talks teams, but
it takes more than an ad hoc group of people to make up a winning
one

By:
Jeremy Schlosberg

VARs are generally too busy running their businesses to stop
and ponder how to run them. They're also notoriously disinclined
to engage in long-term planning. Since long-term planning is
generally considered a good thing, not doing it is pretty much
a bad thing. A seat-of-the-pants operating style also keeps
a VAR insulated from the business self-help crowd. In a day
and age when management theories tend to come and go like the
latest diets, remaining unaware of them may not always be so
terrible. Every now and then, however, a fad appears with the
earmarks of a PIC: that is, a Potentially Important Concept.
The use of teams in business is just such a fad/trend/PIC.
The idea is that a business can function more effectively and
efficiently when some or all of the organization is arranged
into collaborative groups of interdependent employees rather
than given a rigid, hierarchical structure. Employees in teams,
say the experts, feel a greater sense of control over their
jobs and a bigger stake in the company itself. Everybody wins.

In truth, running a business with teams may sound like less
than news for smaller businesses in general, and readers of
this magazine in particular. "The teaming approach is much
closer to what is normal in a smaller company than it is in
a Fortune 500 company," says Gene Bledsoe, principal with The
Casal Group, a Dallas-based consulting firm. In large companies,
employees can be widely scattered, and there can be power enclaves
"fiefdoms," as Bledsoe calls them-that can make genuine teamwork
nearly impossible to come by.

VARs and integrators often employ teams all but unconsciously
for instance, the way a systems integrator will create a project
team to tackle a new client's solution needs, gathering ad
hoc the talent required for the job. Still, there's a difference
between the informal teamwork that arises of necessity in a
small company and a conscious effort to foster a workplace
that relies on teamwork.

Today's technology can assist the teaming process-and many VARs
implement such technology for their customers (i.e., groupware,
or other workgroup-oriented, client-server applications). So
the time seems especially ripe for VARs to stop and think about
how they run their businesses long enough to wonder whether
management by teams might offer genuine potential for increased
productivity and long-term growth.

The team approach to business organization has a leg up on most
business fads since it's based on an intuitive concept rather
than contrived jargon. We already more or less know what a
team is.

"We're not trying to snow anyone here," says Thomas Koulopoulos,
president and founder of the Delphi Consulting Group in Boston.
"Teams are not new. People work naturally as teams." Not only
do organizational charts often have little to do with how people
in a business actually work, but the best workers in a company
are typically those who work outside the formal chart, he says.

"It's not a question of, 'Should we have teams or shouldn't
we?' You should, and, at least informally, you already do,"
says Koulopoulos. "The question to ask is, 'How do I put in
place systems, cultures and technologies to support the natural
collaboration that exists within a company?' "

Natural Collaboration

A perfect illustration of how this sort of natural collaboration
with thoughtful support can enhance corporate performance can
be found in the case of Trellis Network Services Inc., a Princeton,
N.J.-based systems integrator.

Trellis officials have long been conscious of the importance
of teamwork in the context of day-to-day operations. "We've
got dynamic teams springing up and falling down daily," says
Bruce Bancroft, vice president of sales and marketing.

Expertise requirements on any given project can be varied, given
the complex nature of large networks. Not only might Trellis
require four or five different experts on a given project,
but those experts might also be located in four or five different
Trellis offices around the country. What's more, any single
Trellis systems engineer might be a member of as many as four
different project teams simultaneously.

After the success of an internal, Lotus Notes-based sales automation
system implemented approximately four years ago, the Trellis
brain trust recognized a need for a complementary system that
would support the project management process. The company developed
a second Notes-based application for itself in response to
this need, which it called Project Tracker. It's been up and
running for two years.

Project Tracker, replicated in each of Trellis' five offices,
automatically kicks in once a sale is complete, helping project
managers find the appropriate expertise, formulate their teams
and track progress every step of the way. Team members keep
one another apprised of their actions and ideas via Notes.
"From a management standpoint, it's brought a lot of efficiency
to the organization," says Bancroft.

Trellis will even set a Notes station up on the customer's site
if desired, allowing customers a first-hand view of a project's
status. While this can give a customer an unusually uncensored
view-"They see how we're progressing, warts and all," says
Bancroft-Trellis has reaped the benefits of improved relationships
and greater trust as a result. In this case, the technology
has even brought the customer onto the team.

Trellis was using teams before Project Tracker, but the teams
are much more efficient now, according to Bancroft. What's
more, management has been positively affected. Before Project
Tracker, managers fretted over project status and kept themselves
"too intimately involved with managing specific projects."
Now, he asserts, "We have our management people involved in
growing our business, which is really where we want them to
be."

Teams Are People

The Trellis example is instructive, to a point. The type of
team building the experts recommend goes beyond project-oriented
work and ideally extends into the core of a company's hierarchy.
In the Trellis project, technology is valuable but is not the
first step for a team-oriented organization.

"No technology makes people into teams," says Mike Lynch, managing
partner at Learning Resources Group, a Maplewood, N.J., consulting
firm. "People make people into teams." Lynch has developed
and taught classes for the American Management Association
on team development specifically for technical professionals;
he continually encounters people in his classes who come up
to him and say, "Yeah, we have all this technology in place
but it's not working," or "We have these troublemakers who
aren't signing onto the system." Technologically savvy companies
can too easily fall into the trap of applying technology to
a problem before the problem is completely understood.

"You have to determine what you're trying to accomplish first,"
says Lynch. "And you've got to have the willingness to work
together." Only then, he says, should you worry about the technology
that may or may not be needed.

Approached this way, you may be surprised which technologies
if any-apply. Rocky Gunderson, vice president of marketing
for Baan Americas, an ISV that sells enterprise resource planning
software to Fortune 500 manufacturing companies, heads a seven
person team spread throughout the United States and Canada
charged with spearheading a multifaceted marketing program
for a sophisticated software system. About half of Gunderson's
team uses Lotus Notes for communicating and sharing information.
It's especially handy for dealing with European associates
(Baan Americas is a division of the Baan Co., based in Menlo
Park, Calif., and the Netherlands)

Notes is important to the team, says Gunderson, but the technology
he stops to praise is the conference call. Gunderson has a
weekly conference call Mondays at 9 a.m. with his boss; he
then has his own team's conference call Mondays at 1 p.m. Facilitated
by AT&T, the call couldn't be simpler, and it's so effective
that Gunderson cannot remember the last time his team was together
face-to-face.

"I know it's low-tech," he says, almost apologetically. "But
you can really get a lot accomplished with a conference call."

Much less, of course, would be accomplished if Gunderson's team
hadn't worked so well together in the first place and hadn't
established a personal rapport before they became disembodied
voices on the telephone.

It's a simple point that's sometimes lost on technology company
managers. "The biggest problem I've had people bring up in
class is the problem of having remote people on teams," says
consultant Lynch. Teams comprising a far-ranging cast of characters
often don't seem to work so well. Perhaps the ready availability
of WANs and videoconferencing leads too many companies to forget
the basic rules of human interaction. "People have to spend
time with other members of the team; they have to get to know
them, get comfortable with them," says Lynch.

And this must be done face-to-face, at least at first.

Mutually Interdependent

Another basic point that is often overlooked is that not every
group of employees who appear to be working together can be
accurately considered a team. There is, in particular, a striking
difference between a team and that most traditional grouping
of employees within an organization: a department.

"In a department, everybody does the same thing," explains Lynch.
You put a bunch of programmers together and there's your programming
department.

They are not, however, a team. The key is interdependence. "A
department doesn't necessarily equal a team because department
members are not always interdependent upon each other to get
the work done," notes Lynch. Often, they're running parallel.
A team is a group of people who cannot do the job that needs
doing without each other.

Clearly this depends upon the ability of that group of people
not only to get along but, if possible, to enjoy each other's
company. What may be less obvious but of critical importance
are issues of communications style preference. This becomes
an especially noticeable factor when cross-functional teams
are put together.

"The technical person may say, 'Fine, let's e-mail info back
and forth.' The salesperson will say, 'You do that, but I'll
call you once a week so you can tell me how it's going,' "
says Lynch. "The technical person wants to show you data; the
salesperson doesn't care about equipment and numbers-he wants
to know if you feel confident you'll meet the deadline. He's
looking for the personal side."

Another hallmark differentiating a team from other types of
workplace groups is how differently a successful team meeting
is run from a traditional staff meeting. Traditional managers
hold meetings; team managers facilitate them.

"You have to structure meetings so that everybody can provide
input without feeling intimidated," says Al Schornberg, chairman
and CEO of Anatec, a Bingham Farms, Mich., systems integrator.
For instance, if he's with a team that needs to determine next
year's strategic goals, he will have each member write down
10 ideas. The ideas are collected and each one is discussed;
the list is consolidated to reach consensus. "You get a lot
more input that way than if you just asked the question out
loud," Schornberg says.

Good meetings don't happen by accident, and neither do good
teams. Of all the training that may be necessary within companies
serious about team orientation, experts agree that the most
important is communication training. People may seek naturally
to collaborate with each other at work, but that's an ad hoc
reality; a systematic conversion to teamwork is, on the other
hand, a most unnatural progression for many office environments.
Standard U.S. office politics are too entrenched for companies
to go marching too easily down the road of collaboration.

Escaping the Territorial Trap

"In a lot of organizations, there are territorial issues," acknowledges
Lynch. An 'us vs. them' mentality keeps different groups of
people in competition with each other and among themselves.
"The idea that 'We've got to protect our turf or else we won't
have any' still exists in a lot of organizations," he says.

Gunderson has seen this while working for other companies-including
14 years at Hewlett-Packard-sometimes finding himself in charge
of groups that have competed with other groups within the same
company. At Baan last year, he had the opportunity to build
a team-oriented organization from the ground up. He specifically
designed his team to comprise functional managers with complementary
and mutually dependent skills and responsibilities, including
product marketing, program management, strategic partner management
and sales development. Those are all areas that directly contribute
to a company's marketing effort, but are not functions often
located in any traditional sort of marketing department.

Today, Gunderson can say with pride, "You could take me out
of the equation and my group would still work as a team because
they need each other to get the job done."

This is the essence of teamwork: a practically leaderless group
of motivated, well-informed employees doing their thing. Understand
this and you'll soon understand why the model remains less
common than it should be in companies that might otherwise
be fomenting teams right and left: smallish technology solution
providers such as VARs and systems integrators.

Stay Away From the Hub

Think about the typical successful VAR business-founded by a
person of some technological vision and often grown in a blur
of entrepreneurial bluster and resourcefulness. A wonderful
environment, perhaps, for a fledgling company, but CEOs/founders
with too much Bill Gates on the mind do not reflexively cultivate
an organization of sharing, caring equals. They instead tend
to create what Lynch calls a hub structure: The founding chief
is in the middle, fingers in all the pies, entrenched as the
conduit through which all expert information flows.

"What tends to happen over time is they become the roadblock
rather than the conduit," says Lynch. Not only does such a
company run into the common problem of an entrepreneur needing
to learn to delegate responsibility, but as the hub, the founder
can prevent necessary interaction among the minions. "When
communication between various experts has to go through the
boss," says Lynch, "a lot just doesn't get communicated."

Of course, not all companies grow this way; not all CEOs are
hub-lovers. Anatec's Schornberg, for one, considers team building
to be his "primary role."

"What I bring to the table is the ability to put together and
build teams that turn corporate vision into reality," he says.
"That's what my skill sets are. I've tried very hard and diligently
to create a culture here that is team-oriented." Except for
routine functions such as finance and payroll, teams handle
everything Anatec does-from strategic planning to compensation
plan design to social event coordination.

Who, then, decides when a team is needed for a given job? "Actually,"
Schornberg says, "that's a team decision." It's a little more
complex to run day-to-day operations this way as opposed to
where one person makes decisions and that's that, he admits.
But the trade-offs are worth it. "With one person making a
decision, if you don't have buy-in, you get resistance," he
says.

With resistance comes lack of commitment in implementation of
the decision and the potential for morale difficulties and
decreased productivity. Say there's a new compensation plan
in the works. Which is likely to be better received: a decision
emerging from behind a manager's door and announced as a done
deal, or a decision arrived at through group discussion and
consensus?

With teams, says Schornberg, "all the hard work gets worked
out in advance. The implementation is usually the easy part."

The Perpetual Organization

In the best of all possible worlds, team orientation will convert
a company into what Delphi Consulting's Koulopoulos calls the
"perpetual organization"-an ever-shifting organization, ever
responsive to its market, in which all individuals understand
what their roles are in each process and who they are working
with, even as the processes continually modulate and fluctuate.

At least that's the theory, the trend, the Potentially Important
Concept. Then again, such a goal might be a tad unrealistic
for seat-of-the-pants VAR, who will probably still see significant
business process improvement and even productivity gains with
a far more limited, but highly strategic, use of the teaming
approach.

If VARs are rarely prepared to undertake sweeping philosophical
overhauls, Bledsoe lets the cat out of the bag on a dirty little
secret: Very few companies are ever prepared for such things.

"Eighteen months ago, we didn't have e-mail," he says. "Finally,
we put in a network e-mail system, and it has physically changed
the way we do work." Communication within his small firm has
improved dramatically.

"It's those kinds of things that will change business," Bledsoe
says. "They're simple. You don't have to make drastic changes
to your company philosophy or business direction. Those are
the things that affect us as businesses far more than the latest
philosophical theory."

Your Mission In Storage -- RAID, flash and RAM are critical
to your customers

By:
Karen Balch

For clients whose data truly is mission-critical, implementing
a RAID solution may be the key to solidifying your relationship.
What's important is to know when to sell RAID. Find out in
"Know Your RAID? You've Got It Made" (page 105)

Flash technology isn't new, but as with RAID, there are many
new applications for it cropping up. Particularly so with CompactFlash,
a matchbook-sized flash card from SanDisk. In this roundtable,
VARBusiness talked with SanDisk, AP Research and a VAR to flesh
out the opportunities. For the scoop, see "Get It Done In a
Flash" (page 115)

Semiconductor memory of all kinds is in short supply these days.
You need to know how long the shortages are expected to last,
if prices will continue to drop and if a drought is on the
horizon. "RAM Realities" (page 131) will give you some answers.

Savvy VARs are starting to network CD-ROMs for LAN users. Providing
network access to databases, manuals, software or images is
becoming big business for VARs. In "Net Gain From Networked
CD-ROMs," (page 139) see how to do it.

Know Your Raid? You've Got It Made -- The explosion in network
storage needs is driving business to VARs who understand RAID
technology

By:
Ron Levine

The dilemma for users running memory "killer" applications like
imaging, multimedia and online database searches has long been
one of storage space and safety. As networks continue to grow,
so too do their appetites for larger, safer storage systems.
RAID (redundant arrays of independent disks) addresses those
concerns and provides VARs with sales opportunities in client
server, memory-intensive application sites at the same time.
While optical and tape drives offer backup and archiving capacity,
RAID sales add data protection, 100 percent availability and
hard disk speed.

RAID is not a new concept. In fact, RAID has already crossed
the chasm between early adopters and general market acceptance.
Farid Neema, president of Peripheral Concepts Inc., a Santa
Barbara, Calif., research company, says that two years ago,
20 percent of administrators in the PC environment understood
the significant role a RAID subsystem can play. Today he says
that ratio is closer to two thirds in the PC world and 85 percent
in the Unix/midrange environment.

One reason for RAID's popularity is the trend toward larger
networks with more mission-critical data to store and access.
Network storage needs are almost doubling every year, says
Bob Katzive, vice president of DiskTrend Inc., a researcher
in Mountain View, Calif. He notes that already more than 400,000
RAID subsystems are operating in the field, including 375,000
plus network-class server disk arrays. Other technologies popularizing
RAID today include the Internet and video servers. Many companies
downsizing from a mainframe to a client-server environment
are also turning to RAID. For all of those reasons, RAID sales
and support offer opportunities for VARs.

The Name of the Game Is Meeting Users' Needs

"Meeting users' needs for high-speed access to gigabytes of
data, data protection equal to that afforded mainframe files,
and fault-tolerant hardware operation with RAID storage implementations
can be a very profitable business," notes Tony Prigmore, general
manager at Berkshire Computer Products Inc., a Hopkinton, Mass.,
VAR that resells Digital Equipment's StorageWorks products.

Berkshire sold a StorageWorks 410 array to a Fortune 500 company
engaged in commercial transaction processing. The array contains
12 Gbytes of storage capacity plus a write-back cache that
speeds write operations and can accommodate up to 2,600 I/O
transfers per second. The customer is so pleased with the RAID
solution that the 410 array has become the company's standard
storage device across all platforms.

For Prigmore, RAID sales margins have been good both at the
component level and when purchasing complete subsystems for
resale, but he believes the more integration work you do, the
more you can charge: "Profit margins will be in direct proportion
to the amount of system integration performed at the customer's
site. This is the value-added component."

To sell and implement a RAID subsystem is not a slam dunk; you've
got to know what you're doing. You better not promise fault
tolerance and not be able to deliver. But because the profit
potential is there, RAID is worth learning about.

RAID is a large-scale storage technology that replaces one expensive,
high-capacity magnetic disk drive with smaller, less expensive
magnetic drives. RAID provides data protection by either duplicating
(mirroring) or striping data across multiple drives within
the array. If data is lost or corrupted, the array automatically
rebuilds the affected data portions and continues with uninterrupted
operation.

RAID also provides high-data availability through fault-tolerant
hardware performance. By eliminating single points of failure
within the subsystem through duplication of components, near
100 percent uptime for the storage subsystem can be achieved.

Some RAID implementations extend this fault tolerance to protect
against failures in the host I/O access path. By adding dual
controllers, I/O buses and host support for these features,
host system access to the data is protected. A good RAID implementation
can provide data availability and reliability protection equal
to that of a mainframe.

The Six Levels

There are six RAID levels officially recognized by the industry's
RAID Advisory Board: Levels 0 through 5. Levels 1, 3 and 5,
however, are most commonly implemented. Each employs a different
method for recording data. The levels do not denote performance
per se, but do indicate how the data is stored within the array.

RAID Level 1 mirrors all data onto a second disk. It features
excellent data protection and sound overall performance. However,
it is more costly than other RAID levels to employ. Because
of the duplication, only half of the storage space is actually
usable. This makes mirroring the most expensive of the RAID
implementations.

RAID Level 3 stripes data across multiple drives, which enables
the storage subsystem to recreate any lost data on one drive
from the information recorded on the remaining drives. Storage
costs are less than with mirroring, and it is superb in environments
that require the transfer of large blocks of data.

RAID Level 5 stripes the data and the parity across all the
drives. This offers customer sites the highest combination
of data availability and fault-tolerant operation, but results
in a lower write operation performance level. It's best when
processing read requests for file transfers or transaction
type I/Os.

RAID Levels 1 and 3 can perform only a single access (either
read or write) at a time per array; Level 5 RAID can handle
multiple read/write operations. One RAID level is not necessarily
faster than another although the specific implementation of
the RAID level determines performance. The actual array speed
will be determined by the type of interface used, the system
and/or network acting as the host, and the application tasks
being performed.

Some RAID implementations automatically and dynamically adjust
between Levels 3 and 5 as the load changes. With RAID storage
devices, users have faster access to gigabytes of data at a
lower cost than is possible with optical or tape peripherals.
RAID is not a backup device, though, and it is not meant to
replace tape or optical in the backup process. However, it
can be used to replace these devices where online, faster access
to large amounts of data is the key application for the peripheral.

Knowing the advantages RAID can bring to a customer isn't enough
in itself. You also have to know when RAID is the right choice.
"We've been selling RAID solutions for more than four years
and find RAID implementations work best when we need 8 to 10
Gbytes or better of online, fault-tolerant data storage on
the server," says Gentry Ganote, president of Gain Systems
Inc., a Norcross, Ga.-based VAR specializing in high-end file
and application servers and workstations.

Gain Systems sells RAID subsystems from a variety of vendors
and integrates them into existing networks. Gain has successfully
implemented RAID subsystems in SQL servers running under Windows
NT, for NetWare servers and in DOS/Windows environments.

A RAID On Bottlenecks

Many storage-related bottlenecks, particularly in imaging, multimedia,
video or other memory-intensive networking environments, can
be solved by adding a RAID subsystem to the mix. Often, without
RAID, these types of memory-hungry tasks are off-loaded to
optical storage devices or tape subsystems to improve network
performance, which often takes data offline.

No one knows this better than Jim Mendelbaum, president of LAN
Specialist Inc., an integrator in Torrance, Calif., that specializes
in large LAN storage solutions. Having sold Micropolis' RAIDION
Level 5 RAID subsystem, Mendelbaum says, "RAIDION delivers
the high, sustained data transfer rates that imaging and multimedia
tasks require to quickly write and read large-sized files.
And RAIDION can grow with the user; it's scalable between 6
and 282 Gbytes."

Foundation Imaging in Valencia, Calif., which produces graphical
visual effects for broadcast television, is also using the
RAIDION Level 5 array with 110 Gbytes of storage for its imaging
applications. "Our computers all write images to and pull images
off the array. It is a true use of file server capability,"
says Paul Brian, director of operations at Foundation. The
RAID device is on a NetWare 3.12 LAN connected to 20 Pentium
and Alpha nodes running Windows NT and seven Macintosh stations
communicating via Ethertalk. "We went with RAID both for its
redundancy and high sustained data transfer rate. Since all
of our nodes are top of the line with a minimum of 64 Mbytes
of RAM, we needed something that could keep up with their image
transfers," Brian says.

RAID is almost always the right choice when your customer's
LAN handles truly mission-critical data. "The primary reason
for having a RAID system is to provide data protection and
data availability," says Joel Reich, director of marketing
for Conner Storage Systems, Lake Mary, Fla. "Increased storage
capacity and data access speed [achieved by striping] are only
secondary reasons customers purchase RAID."

Still, capacity can be a primary selling point when a company
is downsizing from a mainframe. The goal of switching from
a mainframe to an enterprisewide network sometimes begins to
falter due to the lack of storage on the network. In this case,
RAID's capacity can be a plus. Communication Technical Systems
Inc. (CTS) is a VAR in Roswell, Ga., specializing in migrations
from mainframe to midrange environments. CTS provides client
server solutions based on the HP9000 Series server and Raidtec
Corp.'s FlexArray RAID subsystems. CTS is one-third of the
way through a five-year mainframe conversion project for the
General Board of Pension and Health Benefits of the United
Methodist Church in Evanston, Ill.

Throughout the transition period, the servers process an increasing
percentage of the Board's data. It is essential that the servers
are equipped with the storage capacity and performance to efficiently
handle the $6 billion worth of benefits the company manages
annually for more than 70,000 ministers and employees nationwide.
As a result, the storage system had to be suitable for applications
such as database management, network management and accounting.
"A RAID solution is the storage option of choice for this project
due to its capacity and speed," says Michael Malone, vice president
of sales and marketing at CTS. The VAR chose Raidtec's FlexArray
IX RAID subsystem because of its user-selectable RAID levels.

Raising the Bar

"Everybody wants a storage system that's easy to implement into
their existing structure," says Gain's Ganote. "The MegaRAID
three-channel RAID controller [from American Megatrends Inc.]
used in our RAID implementations is compatible with most networks
and operating systems. This enables us to handle all of our
corporate clients' needs across a variety of platforms." As
Ganote found, when you're choosing a RAID system, compatibility
with a variety of computing environments can be a big issue
with the customer and a big selling point for you.

RAID systems generally integrate well across most hardware platforms.
RAID devices in general work with most major operating system
software as well, including NetWare, Unix, OS/2, Windows NT,
Macintosh and Solaris. As a result, VARs have a key technology
with which to close a storage sale and to gain an account foothold.

Resellers can address user access and backup issues at the same
time by installing a combination of RAID and tape within a
single enclosure. This type of implementation provides reliable
online access to data as well as reliable data backup for high
capacity applications. It also offers the benefit of hot-pluggable
RAID protection and the capacity of DLT tape. For example,
Business Systems Solutions Inc. (BSSI), Buffalo Grove, Ill.,
is one VAR that has implemented such a solution. "It's an ideal
storage product for applications using large databases or extensive
graphics/imaging files," says Scott Bernstein, executive vice
president at BSSI.

BSSI has installed a single-enclosure combination RAID/tape
storage subsystem for a client that develops graphic images
and has an exceptionally large data storage need as a result.
The MegaFlex unit from Storage Dimensions includes 27 Gbytes
of RAID capacity and 20 or 40 Gbytes of DLT capacity (depending
on the media chosen). It was the best solution due to the large
amount of data it could put online and the client's ongoing
need to back up 27 Gbytes of data in a limited time.

Redundant arrays of independent tape drives (RAIT) provide an
alternate large-scale storage option. Like disk arrays, tape
arrays offer data and availability protection, plus they offer
data backup and removable storage. According to GigaTrend Inc.,
a Carlsbad, Calif., reseller specializing in storage backup
systems, RAIT can provide better margins than RAID sales. In
fact, GigaTrend no longer sells hard disk RAID.

"Tape arrays offer the VAR a chance to make better margins than
do disk arrays," says GigaTrend vice president Thomas Culver.
"There is less competition because most of the large hard disk
players are not heavily marketing RAIT solutions; the knowledge
to sell this product is not as easy to master."

GigaTrend offers a line of RAIT products that can be configured
with DAT, 8-mm or DLT tapes to meet needs for large-capacity,
fail-safe data storage. Notes Culver, "When users want storage
to be removable, RAIT is the best solution. If a site is dealing
with large capacities that must be backed up within tight windows,
multiple tape drives in a RAIT configuration yield the speed
required."

The Wait State

But Rik Mussman, vice president of operations for Lighthouse
Technology, a VAR specializing in high-end storage solutions
for Unix and the client-server market, is not a big believer
in RAIT. Mussman says most backup and archival applications
cannot drive a tape array fast enough to make it work. That's
because the RAIT device swallows a block of data (usually 32
Kbytes) quickly, then waits for the backup or archival application
to complete its processing before the device is sent another
block of data. The end result can be a storage device that
spends most of its time in a "wait state." Says Mussman, "Some
promote RAIT as a quick backup method for medium to large data
sets, but we don't see any real advantage to using RAIT."

Even RAIT's proponents will tell you that there is a catch:
Culver says it's on the restore side. Since the data is written
to multiple tapes, risk of data loss increases with the number
of tapes used for the restore operation. In the restore cycle,
the tapes must be readily available and in the correct sequence;
otherwise, the restore will not be able to be completed.

Of course, you have another option: software RAID. Whether a
software or hardware array is best is determined by whether
the user is adding to an existing system or installing a new
one; the customer's I/O performance and data availability requirements
will dictate the answer.

Software RAID is less expensive because it uses existing storage
components, says Paul Massiglia, a member of the industry's
RAID Advisory Board and marketing manager at Digital's Colorado
Springs, Colo., facility. It also provides exceptional data
availability because the hardware array's member disks can
be spread across multiple storage devices or across multiple
host computers while the software array executes on a single
host computer and is very economical.

Still, a hardware RAID system's software management function
is contained within the firmware of the storage subsystem.
This means that it will have little or no impact on host computing
performance. Therefore, hardware implementations generally
offer better I/O performance than software versions.

UNOCAL Accounting Information Systems in Sugarland, Texas, selected
Andataco Corp.'s GigaRAID/FT storage system over its system
vendor's array. UNOCAL systems administration team leader Steven
Clark says the company believed that a hardware RAID implementation
with its faster I/O speed would provide better performance
than software RAID. The 400-Gbyte array, which includes Data
General's CLARiiON hardware and Andataco's array management
software, is running on two 2000E SPARC platforms. The array
is shared between a production system using 240 Gbytes of its
capacity and a test system using the remaining 160 Gbytes.

Your customers' specific needs will determine the form of RAID
that is right for their companies. And your ability to master
the technical intricacies of the different storage systems
will determine which RAID is right for your company to sell
and support. Each one presents its own rewards. All can help
remove your customer's risk and increase your profit margin.

Roundtable: Get it Done In a Flash -- Flash memory is rugged,
compact, and needs little power-benefits that are making it
pop up in new applications every day

By:
Karen Balch

Cameras, cellular phones, pagers, audio recorders, handheld
computers, palmtops, PDAs. Not your typical list of high-margin
hardware for VARs. But the products all have one thing in common
that makes them potential VAR moneymakers: They all have a
growing need for rugged, compact, digital data storage as you
integrate them into vertical solutions.

Flash is solid state, rewritable, nonvolatile memory. It doesn't
require a power source to maintain data, unlike RAM. Better
yet, it's fast. Flash memory isn't new, but some of the uses
for it are. Whether you're talking about embedded flash for
ruggedizing portable PCs or removable flash for gathering,
transporting and sharing data in a mobile environment, applications
for flash technology are expanding. New versions of common
electronic devices-i.e., the pager, audio recorder, palmtop
and so on-are ready to put flash technology to the test.

SanDisk Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., sells 1.8- and 1.3-inch
embedded flash drives as replacements for disk drives where
capacity needs are low

and requirements for ruggedness are high. It offers a Flash
Chipset for small form factor, low-capacity applications such
as PDAs and cellular phones. And it sells flash cards with
a Type II or Type III PCMCIA interface, hitting capacity highs
of 85 Mbytes and 175 Mbytes, respectively. But perhaps the
company's most interesting flash product is CompactFlash, which
is about the size of a matchbook. An intended storage complement
to electronic devices such as the digital camera, CompactFlash
allows data sharing via a PCMCIA Type II adapter. Today, CompactFlash
capacities range from 2 Mbytes to 15 Mbytes, but by 1997, SanDisk
aims to offer 100 Mbytes on the device.

In the following roundtable discussion, VARBusiness talked with
Nelson Chan, vice president of marketing for SanDisk, about
his company's plans for flash technology. Lending her expertise
to the discussion is Katherine Litchfield, vice president of
sales and marketing for Hampton-Royce, a VAR/ISV in Orange,
Calif. Litchfield says that implementing flash technology in
a bundled solution gives her 30 percent margins on the hardware
alone. Last but not least, Andy Prophet, president of market
research and consultancy AP Research in Cupertino, Calif.,
brings his PCMCIA knowledge to the table.

VARBusiness: How does flash technology differ from disk drives?

Chan: You use flash technology in an environment where you need
ruggedness and reliability. CompactFlash cards can withstand
an operating shock of more than 2,000 Gs; that's equivalent
to about a 10-foot drop. Flash also offers extended temperature
ranges and consumes less than 5 percent of the power of a disk
drive. As with a lot of consumer products that run on two AA
batteries, you can't even spin up a disk drive. But you can
use a flash card.

Flash also offers a much higher performance-up to 30 percent
higher than a typical disk drive in a typical read-write application.
Yet it's a smaller form factor than disk drives so we will
be able to go into applications where disk drives are just
too big, such as pagers, audio recorders, cell phones or medical
devices.

Litchfield: All of those reasons are exactly what lets us be
a VAR in this arena. Flash lets us come into a market with
a piece of software that's vertical and sort of niche and be
very successful. Some of the biggest roadblocks to mobile computing
were the weight, the cost, the batteries and the lack of ruggedness.
A lot of that goes back to spinning drives, and when you move
away from that, a lot of obstacles to the marketplace go away.
[Flash technology] is a real lifesaver.

VB: Even though flash and hard drives have different markets,
people tend to compare them. Hard drive proponents say there's
not enough capacity in a flash card to make it worthwhile,
particularly at flash technology's higher cost.

Litchfield: Because we're selling this handheld product bundled
with a card, a case and software, all our users want to know
is that they can load onto here whatever they need, gather
their data and bring it back to the office. There's no real
concern that it's not 120 Mbytes or 250 Mbytes because we're
doing a very vertical approach.

Chan: Today 2 Mbytes allows you to store 20 to 24 images for
digital cameras. It allows you to store 1,200 to 1,400 pages
of double-spaced text. That amount also allows you to store
30 to 60 minutes of voice for audio devices. It's a lot of
capacity.

Clearly if you're in an environment where you need gigabytes,
or even hundreds of megabytes, you're going to use a disk drive.
Take a look at a typical computer on a desktop. There users
don't care about ruggedness and reliability because the computers
are stationary. They don't care about power because they're
hooked up to an A/C outlet. They need lots of capacity because
they're running Windows and they've got all of these applications,
so in that environment, you will always use disk drives.

Disk drives also have a very low per-megabyte cost. They are
inexpensive because they can absorb that cost over so much
storage. Flash technology's disadvantage is cost-per-megabyte.
But we look at it from a unit cost standpoint. In any of these
applications, if all you need is 2 Mbytes, guess what? We're
cheaper than any disk drive and we give you all the benefits.
[For handheld applications], there isn't another solution.
We're cheaper than disk drives because the capacity isn't required.
If you look at [cell phones, pagers, audio recorders, PDAs
and so on], disk drives are not going to be used in any of
those other devices, but flash will be. And if you want to
open it up to other storage technologies such as CD-ROMs, floppies
or magneto-optical, they're not going to be used in all these
devices either. We think only flash will.

VB: Because the other storage devices are too big?

Chan: They're too big and they can be too expensive depending
on the capacity you need. Plus, flash will allow you to move
information between all those different devices, whether that
information is data, voice, audio or images. An ideal application
is a digital camera where you go out and take pictures. When
you come back, you take the CompactFlash card out-it's your
digital film of the future. You plug it into an adapter and
now you can plug it into any notebook or desktop and enhance
the photos, cut and paste them, do whatever you want. So moving
information between different devices is also a very important
consideration.

Prophet: The real potential for flash memory, particularly under
its current pricing structure, is for value-added applications
vertical markets where the margins are higher or wider and
you have more latitude.

VB: What are VARs going to do with flash drives?

Chan: Let's say you want to ruggedize a computer. Take J.B.
Hunt Transport, one of the largest trucking companies in the
United States. IBM has designed a ruggedized computer [for
the cabs of Hunt's trucks] with our solid state solution instead
of a disk drive, because when a truck goes over a speed bump
or hits a pothole you don't want the system to come down. In
that computer is also a global positioning system. For a VAR
to be able to go to a company and say that you've got a complete
solution-all the software, all the infrastructure, everything
put in-that's a unique solution.

VB: What's the capacity on the flash drive?

Chan: It depends on the form factor. In terms of the 1.8-inch
form factor, we go up to 80 Mbytes. In terms of the 1.3-inch,
we go up to 60 Mbytes, and these are uncompressed numbers.
We can effectively double those capacities with compression.
The nice thing about this is that VARs can take out the disk
drives and plug this in and away they go; there's no software
changes required or anything else.

VB: There are a lot of VARs who are going to see flash and CompactFlash
cards as off-the-shelf products. What's the VAR application
there?

Litchfield: We bundle the handheld computer, software and CompactFlash
all together. For example, the software that we have on this
handheld unit is inspection software, and what better to go
along with an inspection than a picture? We're integrating
a digital camera into this application so when someone says
that there was a crack in their wall, the inspector can take
a picture of it. Then, they not only have a picture they can
include in a report, but they have a picture that they can
store on a PC someplace and keep for six months or a year.
So it's an absolutely perfect adjunct to the sale, and the
CompactFlash allows us to do exactly what Nelson's talking
about-moving and sharing data.

VB: And this adds enough profit to your sale to be worth bundling
it?

Litchfield: Sure. Customers want a low-cost solution, but low
cost doesn't always mean buying at absolutely the lowest dollar.
They will pay slightly more for every one of these items [digital
camera, cellular phone, pager, PDA, etc.] if they are all married
together in a nice little box that's brought out and dropped
off on the doorstep.

VB: What is the percentage of margin you can add to a sale involving
those types of products?

Litchfield: We are probably running at 30 percent at least on
the [bundled] hardware items [i.e., the handheld computers,
PDAs, cameras, CompactFlash disks, etc.] alone, which is high
in hardware. Of course, when we add the software, the margins
go up. Users get a single product and they have a single person
to go back to if something doesn't work. And it's worth the
extra amount that they pay for that.

VB: Then flash cards and CompactFlash aren't really retail products
just yet, are they?

Chan: The demand isn't out there yet. To put it into a store,
you've got to have people coming in and asking for it and it
isn't there yet. This is still primarily an OEM and VAR type
of business.

VB: Clearly, there are a number of emerging uses for flash cards.
But how does a VAR know which brand to buy? Your primary competitors
are Intel and AMD. How do your cards differ from theirs?

Chan: Mostly, it has to do with intelligence. We offer an ATA
card and they offer a non-ATA card. But the ATA card is the
industry standard. The key advantage to having an ATA solution
is that it's plug-and-playable with any devices that conform
to ATA. And ATA is supported in every major operating system
today. So you really have true plug-and-play instead of plug
and-pray.

The second big advantage has to do with the guarantee of forward
and backward compatibility. I guarantee that, if you buy this
camera and you buy [CompactFlash as film], it'll work. Two
years from now, let's say you need to buy additional film,
but it's based on different generations of memory because two
years from now we'll have advanced from where we are today.
I guarantee you, when you buy that, you can plug it in and
it will work.

The Intel solution cannot guarantee that, nor can it guarantee
that they have true plug-and-play because they require a flash
file system. The problem with flash file systems today is that
there are so many different versions.

VB: Why would they make that choice then?

Chan: They'll say that they're lower in cost because they don't
have to have an intelligent controller. We disagree with that
because, as you get to higher flash capacities-probably 2 Mbytes
and above-that controller cost is amortized over the memory
so the controller cost becomes insignificant, yet you get all
those advantages. At very, very low capacities, they may have
a cost advantage. But look at all the problems you have when
you have an incompatibility and when you don't have guaranteed
backward compatibility.

VB: With such disparate ideas, why did SanDisk sign a cross
licensing agreement with Intel?

Chan: Intel has a large flash patent portfolio, we have a large
flash patent portfolio, so we've licensed each other. This
allows each of us complete freedom in terms of developing products
without worrying about infringing on each other's patents.

Prophet: The issue the industry is wrestling with now is more
in respect to CompactFlash. SanDisk has formed an association
to establish CompactFlash as a standard. Of course, some of
the other suppliers in the industry-Intel and AMD-are doing
their own standards. So we're going to have a proliferation
of standards here for awhile. But within a few years' time,
that will all be resolved because it's just too large a market
to have disparate standards.

Chan: Just because we sign a cross-licensing agreement doesn't
mean that we're not going to compete with each other in the
marketplace. We will still compete with Intel, and fundamentally,
it will be our ATA solution vs. their non-ATA solution. That's
where the battle lines will be drawn.

Prophet: You have to be careful about standards, though. To
do something like a camera, you don't need ATAs. You could
do something much simpler because you don't need all the overhead
that's required in software to be able to support it; just
memory. You don't need socket services, and card services and
all these functions because it's not a computer.

VB: But to take the information and load it into a personal
computer...

Prophet: Yes, then you need the ATA interface.

Litchfield: That's what's nice about the SanDisk product.

VB: Let's go back to some of the other emerging applications
for CompactFlash. What are some of the VAR applications for
audio recorders and pagers, for example?

Litchfield: You might begin to see voice integration into pictures
and information that's been gathered in the field. As voice
recognition comes along, the user can walk around and, instead
of having to write or mark or enter something on a handheld
computer, he could talk to it. Think about the ability to build
in communication and to pick up voice and pictures and to send
that information elsewhere.

Those are the things VARs can look at doing. As each of those
parts begins to be economically feasible for a vertical market
and they are economically feasible for business long before
they are for consumer products-the user would be able to do
this all in one place at one time.

Prophet: Just to give you a dramatic example, we've been doing
some research into flash and its applications. The insurance
industry buys more file cabinets than any industry in the world.
What's the problem? What they're doing is capturing images.
A claims adjuster sees an automobile accident. He takes a picture
of the car. That has to be put into the file so that they have
evidence that this really happened. Then they have the bill
from the guy that did the repairs. All those things have to
be kept on file. That's a huge, huge imaging problem. Digitizing
that and capturing it in some electronic media is crucial.
Controlling it and accessing it is the other part. The critical
element is that camera and the flash memory. That is the key.

VB: But that's what document imaging is all about. People can
take all that information now, scan it into their computers
and store it on whatever it is they want to store it on-tapes,
CD-ROMs, whatever.

Litchfield: We were in imaging 10 years ago, and that was a
market that never quite came to where it should have. Part
of the problem is the size of those files. It's the manual
effort that has to go into scanning that photo or document
and identifying it. But you can take a digitized picture, put
it onto flash and move it off someplace else. It doesn't have
to be scanned, it's already there. No manual operation.

VB: So what can CompactFlash do for the pager?

Chan: With the pager, you have a really unique application.
A regular flash card is too big for the pager. It's bigger
than the pager. But CompactFlash is an ideal size.

The problem with pagers today is that if I want to reach you,
I dial your pager number, enter the number that I'm at and
sit by the phone until you call me. The nice thing about this
is that I'll be able to leave you a voicemail on the CompactFlash
disk. Then I can go about my business. When you get out of
your meeting or whatever, you can listen to it. You can save
it or delete it. That will make pagers a lot more useful than
they are today.

Prophet: The other implication here is for the VAR. If resellers
add services and value to paging technology, they're opening
up markets that traditionally haven't been touched.

Litchfield: From a VAR's standpoint, that is what's key about
all of this. All of a sudden, this technology has opened up
an immense potential market that has never been touched.

Memory: RAM Realities For Resellers -- Rising prices, tight
supplies and shortages promise to make the memory market unstable
for the next several years, but there are ways to protect yourself
and your customers

By:
Rick Cook

n the 1930s, it became popular among a certain fashionable set
to say, "A woman can never be too rich or too thin." In the
'90s, it has become fashionable among computer users to say,
"You can never have too much memory." Getting caught without
enough RAM has caused VARs to say much less quotable things.
That's because another industry saying-"chips always get faster,
better and cheaper"-doesn't hold true for memory anymore.

"Memory prices are the same as they were a couple of years ago,"
says Manouch Moshayedi, CEO of memory vendor Simple Technology
Inc. "Traditionally, the price has gone down." As a result,
a 4-Mbyte memory chip that cost $14 a few years ago still costs
$14, instead of dropping into the $4 to $5 range as it would
have if normal historical models had held.

This situation probably won't change until the end of the decade,
if then. No one expects a panic in the RAM market, but rising
memory prices, tight supplies and sporadic shortages are going
to be facts of life for the future.

"There's definitely more demand than supply," says Cheri Kaplan
Smith, director of technical products for Merisel. "There's
a delta [excess demand] of about 20 percent."

Like everyone else, VARs have to adapt and plan ahead. Sue Telerico,
product manager at Entex Information Systems, a Rye Brook,
N.Y.-based systems integrator, says Entex is preparing for
tight supplies.

Part of the concern is Windows 95. The current RAM situation
is strongly influenced by the release of Microsoft's new operating
system and the need to put at least 8 Mbytes of RAM in even
a minimally equipped Win95 machine. Microsoft says you can
run Win95 with only 4 Mbytes of memory, but people who are
using the new OS say 8 Mbytes is about the practical minimum
and that 16 Mbytes is much better.

Because the Pentium processor is said to be the perfect platform
for Win95, the market for RAM used in Pentium systems, notably
EDO RAM (Extended-Out DRAM) for main memory and SRAM (static
RAM) used for cache, is especially affected. But that's not
the whole story. DRAM has been on allocation for nearly six
years. Even when the Win95-induced bulge of DRAM moves through
the pipeline, demand will still exceed supply.

"As we move to the end of 1996, we'll see the supply-demand
ratio change to something like 10 percent below demand," says
Gary MacDonald, vice president of marketing for Kingston, a
manufacturer of RAM modules. "That's probably what the market
will declare typical or normal."

As a practical matter, 10 percent to 20 percent shortages don't
mean a DRAM drought. They do mean you'll have to make RAM supply
part of your planning. You'll usually be able to find the RAM
you need, although you may have to call around to get it and
the prices might change quickly. The underlying problem is
supply (See sidebar, "Supply-Side 'Dis'Economies"). Manufacturing
of advanced chips of all kinds is in short supply and will
probably stay in short supply for at least the rest of the
decade.

Another part of the problem is the proliferation of RAM types.
It used to be that DRAM was DRAM, and that's all a VAR had
to worry about. Now there is DRAM for main memory, SRAM for
cache, Video RAM for video subsystems and so on. Even DRAM
is getting specialized, with EDO RAM, plus the different kinds
of memory modules such as SIMMs and DIMMs, used to pack RAM
tighter into systems. This means memory manufacturers have
to further subdivide memory capacity and suppliers have to
put it in the right kinds of packages.

"The makers of PCs, laptops and workstations have thrown so
many different things on the motherboard that you need a specific
type of memory applied to each machine," says Moshayedi. "Because
of that, even if standard types of parts are not in short supply,
you may still have a major problem."

So what's a VAR to do? The first thing is to understand that,
like it or not, you're a RAM player. You will be supplying
RAM as part of a solution sale. According to Dataquest Inc.,
a researcher in San Jose, the average system shipped by vendors
in 1995 had slightly more than 7 Mbytes of RAM installed. By
the time it reached the desktop, the average system had roughly
15 Mbytes of RAM on board. By 1997, Dataquest predicts the
average business PC will have approximately 24 Mbytes of RAM
and will be shipped from the factory with 12.

"The PC OEMs have been shipping base unit configurations because
they're so price-sensitive and because of memory allocations,"
says Kingston's MacDonald. "Then they let the distribution
channel actually complete the fulfillment." The result is the
"instant upgrade," where the VAR or dealer adds RAM before
the system reaches the customer. "For the corporate account
reseller, the value-add is going to be building in the additional
DRAM and static RAM."

You can't afford to burden your customers with sluggish systems.
After all, less memory means slower computers. Plan your sale
to include the extra RAM your customers will need and price
accordingly. Depending on the economies of the situation (nature
of the sale, market conditions and prices, kind of memory needed,
time frame, availability of memory from the OEM, etc.), you
may want to order systems from the manufacturer with additional
RAM already installed, or add third-party RAM yourself. The
decision will depend on the relative costs, product availability
and the customer's requirements.

One of the rather peculiar results of the RAM shortage is that
system makers can be cheaper than third-party suppliers for
RAM. Manufacturers, especially big players such as Compaq and
IBM, often get the best prices because they buy on long-term
contracts and in large quantities. Sometimes they pass the
savings on to VARs who order machines with extra memory.

Then again, sometimes not. The manufacturers may want to use
that memory to pump out more basic systems and price their
memory upgrades accordingly. Moshayedi advises checking price,
supply and availability of a RAM part before writing a bid
that includes it. Usually a quick phone call to your supplier
can give you the information you need.

Beyond supply, there are other considerations. First, make sure
you have the right kind of memory. This means not only the
right kind of chips, but also the right modules. SIMMS (Single
In-line Memory Modules) are still common, but they're being
replaced by double-sided DIMMs (Dual In-line Memory Modules)
in newer systems. This is a common source of confusion in ordering
memory. Make sure you know all the relevant specs (module type,
bus width, kind of memory, speed) when you order memory. Don't
assume two products are equivalent.

One way to be sure is to order by make and model of computer
rather than by memory specification. Some companies make it
easy by providing extensive cross-referenced lists showing
what memory products go with what computers. Companies such
as Kingston and Simple take this a step further by supplying
their customers with electronic catalogs that cross-reference
their product lines with machines. If a part is especially
hard to get, it can be worthwhile dealing with a vendor that
makes its own memory modules. Often those companies can fabricate
hard-to-find modules on short notice.

Another caution: Be sure you can easily upgrade the memory in
the machines you sell. Having 16 Mbytes may be enough now,
but in another couple of years your customer may want 32 or
even 64 Mbytes. Can you add the extra RAM to the existing motherboards
or will you have to do an expensive RAM swap or an even more
expensive motherboard replacement?

Long Memories

learly, now is the time to build relationships with vendors
or distributors to make sure you can get the RAM you need.
"The key in this market is your relationships," Telerico says.
"You need to develop long-term relationships with memory providers.
When these problems become extensive, it's your relationships
with your suppliers that will carry you through."

One way to do this is to leverage your business. "A VAR who
is talking to a supplier on a daily basis can always get stable
pricing," says Moshayedi. "When you're spreading yourself too
thin and your numbers are down, no one thinks you're very important."
At the same time, it's important to have more than one source.
"Having a sole supplier is not a good strategic position to
be in now," says Telerico. "I work with three or four primary
suppliers and a couple of secondaries."

Besides Kingston, Simple Technology and PNY Electronics Inc.,
VARs buy memory products from distributors such as Merisel
or Ingram Micro. Wherever you get your memory, though, continuing
relationships are important.

Tell your customers what you're up against in the RAM market.
Although allocations have existed in the memory business for
five years, many customers are unaware of it. "We've set the
expectations with our customers based on the fact that the
industry is experiencing supply challenges," Telerico says.
"We either provide them with an alternative or inform them
there's an extended lead time. Generally, they stick with us."

Don't promise more than you can supply. If you don't have the
memory, or if it will be back-ordered, say so. Specify memory
precisely in your bids and help your customers interpret the
significance of those specifications. If the specifications
aren't complete, the customer could end up with slower, less
satisfactory memory dragging down the performance of the system.

Balance is the key to getting the best performance out of modern
computers. This means you have to understand what each system
will be used for and how it fits into your customer's overall
architecture. Obviously, more is more when it comes to memory.
But there is such a thing as too much memory, especially too
much DRAM or expensive cache SRAM.

Similarly, you must balance video memory against requirements.
A graphics workstation needs a lot of video memory, while a
server can usually get by with minimal video memory and a desktop
PC may only need 1 Mbyte on the video card.

If you fully understand your customer's requirements, it's not
difficult to strike the right memory balance. The shortage
won't go away anytime soon, but it's only a problem if you
let it be one. If you maintain a good relationship with your
suppliers and communicate with your customers, you'll minimize
your memory problems.

Chip Storage: Supply-Side `Dis'Economies

By:
Rick Cook

Memory products have been in short supply for some time. The
underlying problem is that supplies of advanced semiconductors
of all sorts are tight, and there's no relief in sight. Demand,
driven by an explosion of memory use in both computer and noncomputer
products, is just too high for chip makers to keep up with.

According to industry experts, it will take more than a dozen
advanced semiconductor factories opening every year for the
next decade just to keep up with the demand. "That's probably
a minimum," says Brian Matas, an analyst with ICE, a Scottsdale,
Ariz., semiconductor market research company.

Intel's response to such industry forecasts was the buzz at
the last SEMICon/West show in San Francisco in July 1995: "There
aren't that many cement trucks in the world," an Intel spokesman
said. Enough cement trucks, maybe. But the supplies of chip
making equipment, designers, engineers, skilled construction
workers and trained operators are definitely going to be stretched
to the limit to meet the demand.

There is also the cost. In 1990, new chip factories cost an
average of $1 billion each. Today the average is closer to
$1.5 billion each, and by the end of the decade those fabs
will be closer to $2 billion. No one can afford excess capacity,
so fabs are planned to come on-line when needed.

Finally, the semiconductor industry is becoming more highly
integrated and problems anywhere in the world affect the market
quickly. When the power went off on the Malaysian island of
Penang earlier this year it had a nearly immediate effect on
the spot market where RAM is freely traded. A fire in a Japanese
plastics factory, an earthquake in Kobe all have trickle-down
effects on you.

Experts predict a combination of steady-to-gently-rising prices
and spot shortages. At press time, DRAM supplies were good,
but SRAM-used as cache memory-was in short supply. By the time
you read this, SRAM should have caught up to the demand, but
something else may likely be tight.

Planning critical memory needs as far ahead as you can will
save you loads of frustration. Forecasting demand and balancing
that with the advantages of just-in-time purchasing isn't easy,
but if having memory on hand is crucial to your customer relations,
it may be necessary for a while longer.

Net Gain from Networked CD-ROMs -- The growing need to access
corporaate data on CD-ROMs opens doors for network-savvy VARs

By:
Rick Cook

CD-ROMs are going corporate. The need to network them means
sales for you-if you can do the job. "It's a booming market,"
says Richard Krueger, vice president of marketing for Meridian
Data Inc., a maker of networkable CD-ROM products. "It's an
area that's really starting to take off."

The main reason networking CD-ROMs is becoming such big business
is the proliferation of data that is stored on and read from
disks. Databases, manuals, new application software, images,
regulations, legal decisions and other business-critical information
are being published on CD-ROMs. Increasingly, more organizations
need to make that data available to more of their employees.

CD-ROM-savvy VARs installing these optical systems on their
clients' networks are getting in on a growing market. "We're
seeing quite a bit of it," says Ed Amash, director of imaging
systems at Accudata Systems Inc., a VAR in Houston. Market
size is relative, of course. Networked CD-ROMs will probably
always be small potatoes compared with desktop CD-ROMs. "There
are probably 53 million CD-ROM drives installed [to date],"
Meridian's Krueger says. "But only a small proportion of those
are going into corporate LANs."

Still, a small proportion of a 53-million unit business that
doubled in the past year alone is quite a bit of business.
Network installations are especially attractive to VARs because
there is more chance to add value. A desktop CD-ROM drive can
be bought from a superstore retailer for $200 or less and installation
is relatively straightforward. Networking CD-ROM drives takes
far more expertise and is much more likely to be VAR territory.

Fundamentally, companies put CD-ROM drives on their networks
for two reasons: to reduce costs and/or to increase security.
The security issue is simple: CD-ROMs are easy to slip into
a pocket or purse. Given the cost of the information, it is
worth safeguarding the disks by keeping them in a central location
where they can be shared, but not so easily removed.

The cost-savings issue is a bit more intricate. Some companies
save money by networking CD-ROMs the same way they save money
by networking printers. Hardware costs can be kept lower when
users share resources. But with CD-ROM drives so inexpensive,
it's hard to justify the expense of a jukebox or bank of CD
ROM drives just on hardware savings alone.

Software savings are usually more important because they can
be much larger. Many commercial databases are very expensive.
Something as simple as a year's worth of newspaper back issues
can cost $800 annually. And many of the more specialized databases,
such as court decisions, can run thousands or tens of thousands
of dollars per year per copy. As a result, sharing those databases
is the only logical way to go.

Either Way, It's a Winner

Regardless of which features convince your customers to sign
on the dotted line, networking CD-ROMs is a classic value-add
sale. To be successful, a VAR has to know the technology thoroughly
and understand what the customer needs. "You can't simply call
up your distributor and say, 'I want Toshiba drives,'" says
Michael Raab, president of Optical Laser Inc., a Huntington
Beach, Calif., distributor of optical storage products. "Networked
CD-ROMs are still a solution sale. The important thing is to
select the right solution."

Networking a CD-ROM system can be done a number of different
ways. Raab reels off the possibilities: "You can hook up to
the network file server, use a dedicated PC as a CD-ROM server
or you can do a direct LAN attachment." Some systems use Terminate
and Stay Residents (TSRs), some use NetWare Loadable Modules
(NLMs), while others use LAN attachment units. "Those methods
may seem like small differences to the salesperson, but to
the user they can make a big difference."

Finding Your Market

lthough networked CD-ROMs are usually thought of as a vertical
market product, they are used in so many vertical markets that
they are becoming almost universal. Every market that needs
to access a lot of information is increasing its use of CD
ROMs. They're familiar, affordable and accessible. Users in
law offices, medical offices, imaging businesses, libraries,
publishing, wholesale and retailers with catalogs are hot on
the CD-ROM trail. The question isn't so much which markets
use CD-ROMs as it is which ones don't. Unlike some kinds of
hardware, selling networked CD-ROMs usually doesn't involve
demonstrating the need to the customer. "The sale usually isn't
driven by you," says Amash, "It's driven by their understanding
of the availability of published data."

One of the most important decisions a VAR has to make is the
kind of CD-ROM reader the client's network needs. A single
CD-ROM drive is by far the least expensive solution-if it will
work. The problem is that the client is either limited to using
a single disk or someone has to change disks manually. This
may be acceptable if the primary use of CD-ROMs is an occasional
software upgrade or the like, but most network installations
need more than one drive.

Jukeboxes provide access to many different disks, but not all
at once. A stack of drives is generally more expensive, but
it keeps more of the data available all the time. "A jukebox
gives you access to a large number of disks for relatively
few readers," says David Butler, manager of sales and marketing
for Plextor, a maker of CD-ROM drives in Santa Clara, Calif.
"That's a good solution if you have a range of [CD-ROM disks]
that need to be accessed, but it's not for a whole lot of people
who need access to the information at once."

Applications for jukeboxes might include historical information,
blueprints and financial records. A CD-ROM stacker, or "tower,"
is better suited to applications where many people need the
same information on a recurring basis. It boils down to needing
to access information online vs. near-line.

"If data availability is critical, then you need a tower," says
Amash. "But if data availability is random and not always mission
critical, then a jukebox would be the way to go."

Butler points out that the choice is not either/or. "Both needs
exist and both can exist in the same organization at the same
time. It makes sense for the VAR to work with the IS manager
to identify what the organization is trying to accomplish and
to mix and match the right products to do the job."

Whether you choose a jukebox or tower, reliability and availability
are important factors for networked CD-ROM systems. Network
CD-ROM drives typically work much harder than their desktop
counterparts. That makes it worth paying extra for higher-quality
and more reliable drives. If a desktop CD-ROM drive fails,
one user is inconvenienced. If it's a networked CD-ROM drive,
everyone may be locked out from critical information. Pundits
say the speed of the drive doesn't seem to affect the reliability
and there are a range of prices in every speed category.

Like RAID systems, some companies, including Plextor, now offer
CD-ROM towers with hot-swappable drives and power supplies.
A network sale should probably include at least one shelf spare
so the customer can get the system back on track quickly.

VARs also can add value by selling a CD-Recordable (CD-R) system
as part of their packages. Customers who need jukeboxes can
often benefit from keeping data produced in-house on CD-ROMs
as well. With the dropping cost of CD-R drives and the growing
ease of use of the software, this option makes sense for many
companies today. As the VAR implementing such a solution, you
must be sensitive to more than just the hardware and software
needs of your clients, though. Another important consideration
is the corporate culture-specifically the degree of centralization
required. Some companies prefer to have their CD-ROM drives
centralized under the MIS department. Others want the drives,
and the control, in the individual departments or even the
workgroups that are actually using the information.

One reason MIS needs to stay involved is the drive letter dilemma
 Multiple CD-ROMs on a network can "eat" drive letters. "It's
unfortunate that the Novell and Windows paradigms require a
one-to-one correspondence between a drive letter and a peripheral
device like a CD-ROM drive," says Meridian's Krueger. "If you're
in a small- to medium-sized company, your users almost immediately
run out of drive letters."

Often, NetWare and Windows NT associate a drive letter with
a device; in a networked environment, that means you're likely
to run out of drive letters long before you run out of devices.
There are several ways around this problem, all of varying
expense and degree of difficulty. Most of them involve software
add-ons that let the system treat multiple CD-ROM drives as
a single device.

Two examples: Meridian Data offers versions of its CD-Net products
as standalone software, as a subsystem to attach to a PC on
the network or as a complete CD-ROM server built into a tower.
Stac Inc.'s new CD-QuickShare compresses the contents of the
CD-ROMs onto hard disks for quicker access. In both cases,
many CD-ROMs appear to the network as a single virtual CD-ROM
drive.

Despite those considerations, networking CD-ROMs is not rocket
science. "It's not a no-brainer, but it doesn't require a systems
design engineer," says Amash. "It's just a matter of understanding
the needs, the growth direction of the customer and a couple
of cultural issues to get a feel for what is required."

Case Study: Driving CD-ROM Sales -- VAR's slick system helps oil companies
access information online

By:
Rick Cook

One of the good things about selling networked CD-ROM solutions
is that the customer often comes looking for you. Take Ed Amash
of Accudata Systems Inc., a VAR in Houston who cites his company's
experience with a large oil company it first made contact with
at a seminar Accudata hosted on CD-ROMs on the network. "They
came up to us afterward and said IBM was publishing all the
manuals for their mainframes on CD-ROMs and they wanted their
technical people to have access to all those CDs online," Amash
recalls.

The initial contact quickly led to the qualifying session that
narrowed down the oil company's exact needs. Although there
were only 11 CD-ROMs in the set, the company wanted room for
expansion. After discussing the company's requirements, Accudata
proposed a two-unit tower system with 14 drives in each tower
using Meridian Data's Model 314 CD-ROM servers. By using two
servers, the customer got slightly better performance and,
more importantly, redundancy.

Installing the CD-ROMs and associated software was handled by
IBM after Accudata had integrated the servers. Accudata people
stood by during the installation to iron out any problems that
might have arisen. The sale took roughly six months to complete,
but Amash says some are done in as little as two weeks so the
client can try out the software within the publisher's free
trial period. In general, he says, sales cycles for networked
CD-ROMs run three to six months.

One of the differences in CD-ROM sales is that the real product
is information, not hardware or software. "Generally, your
customer is someone who's looking for something to run the
CD-ROM titles," Amash says. "That's what drives the sale."

Tomorrow's CD-ROM -- High-density formats will open up new uses

By:
Rick Cook

Despite its greatness today, tomorrow's CD-ROM will be better.
Two separate camps, which had independently been developing
a new high-density CD-ROM format, have reached an agreement
for a new standard called Micro UDF, more commonly known as
digital video disk, or DVD. The DVD standard is comprised of
four subsets-one for the entertainment industry and three for
computers. Although the first introductions in 1996 will probably
be for home video players, the technology and format will be
similar for the data storage products that follow.

The first computer DVD phase will be a read-only version that
offers roughly 4.7 Gbytes on a single layer of the disk. "The
size of software is going up dramatically, and the sizes of
the databases distributed on CDs are growing," says Ray Freeman,
facilitator for the Optical Storage Technology Association
and president of Freeman Associates, a market researcher in
Santa Barbara, Calif. "Multimedia presentations will take up
a tremendous amount of space." Future versions of the CD-ROM
disk will have multiple layers, and the disks will eventually
be double-sided and multilayered.

The second phase will allow users to record their own CDs and
read them on the same drive. The third phase will offer recordable
and erasable technologies in one, ultimately reaching a capacity
of 17 Gbytes. All three phases will be backward-read compatible
to allow them to read disks recorded today.

Ease of use and the addition of recording and erasing operations
will open new doors for CD-ROM usage. The easier a technology
is to use, the more commonplace it tends to become. And the
more commonplace, the more likely DVD will be to appear on
networks.

CDs are going to be a fact of network life for a long time to
come. If you're equipped to network CDs effectively, you'll
have an advantage with your clients over VARs who don't hold
that expertise-no matter how the technology evolves.

Real-World Challenges -- From dealing with substance abuse to
paying taxes, it's all part of the manager's job


January is an important time in a business. It's when you put
directives in place in preparation for the new year's challenges.
A critical time because your groundwork affects your standing
at year's end.

In our first installment of Executive Challenge (page 149),
an enlightened VAR says it best: "Prepare now because it can
be devastating when you don't know what to do." He's talking
about firing an employee for drug abuse. The ordeal took a
tremendous toll on his company. It could have been much easier
had he been prepared.

Evaluating vendors' channel programs is also important. Program
Profiles (page 152) highlights Computer Associates, Attachmate
and Maxoptix Corp.'s programs. In Distribution (page 156),
there's important information about sales tax. Many distributors
are getting tough on VARs who aren't collecting tax on interstate
sales. And just in time for tax season, we're putting you to
the test with our VARBiz Quiz (page 152) on income tax returns.

With the challenges also comes great promise. In the end it
will be your foundation that determines your outcome.

Executive Challenge: The Hidden Problem -- Develop a policy to fight 
substance abuse

By:
Deidra-Ann Parrish

We don't tolerate it in our politics, in our schools or even
in athletics, so why tolerate substance abuse in the workplace?

In a Gallup Organization study, employers say they consider
drug abuse a "very serious" problem. Yet nearly 75 percent
of that group have no specific policy for dealing with substance
abuse in their own companies.

The reason? "It's one of those things that you cross your fingers
and close your eyes to, hoping it won't come back to haunt
you," says John (not his real name), president and founder
of a multimillion-dollar software development company. Recently
John had to tackle his biggest challenge yet: firing a longtime
colleague-we'll call him Dave-with a substance abuse problem.

"Dave was a heavy drinker at trade shows and after hours," says
John. "But no one made a big deal about it because we all had
a drink or two at events like that."

Dave, however, drank to excess. Politely ignoring his slurred
speech and off-handed remarks became routine for his colleagues.
After late nights at out-of-town events, his absence at morning
meetings wasn't unexpected nor reprimanded.

In retrospect, John says, "We felt what he did during off-hours
was none of our business as long as he got his work done."
But the company's tolerance may have been the worst solution.
Dave's drinking got worse. Monday morning hangovers lasted
most of the week. Some suspected that his habit may have graduated
to cocaine use. And eventually, Dave's work suffered.

The president finally confronted Dave about his declining performance,
and he confessed his problem with drugs and alcohol. That was
lucky for everyone because John had no idea how to handle the
problem had Dave denied it.

John should have had a companywide policy on drug use from the
start. But his dilemma was now past that, so he did what most
small to midsize companies do: He counseled Dave himself, gave
him several leaves of absence and 101 chances to save his job.

John's reaction was typical of managers at smaller companies
with no official policy for employee substance abuse, says
Bruce Wilkinson, president of Workplace Consultants Inc., New
Orleans. But, he adds, it's a mistake for any company to get
directly involved. "It's the employer's responsibility to support
and document the condition, not to diagnose or treat it."

Dave's drug habit was costing him $100 a day by the time he
confessed. After a difficult year, he was finally let go. John
and his staff immediately began discussing options for implementing
a company substance abuse program.

In tackling this prickly subject, first determine what your
position will be on substance abuse. Consider what measures
you'll use to ensure a drug-free workplace and what penalties
you'll impose for offenders.

Since the laws on employee drug testing vary by state-it's legal
in all states and a few have made it mandatory-you'll generally
have the freedom to decide what action jibes with your corporate
culture. There are serious considerations on both sides of
the issue.

In a survey of drug users who called the (800) COCAINE hotline
at Fair Oaks Hospital, Summit, N.J., 75 percent used drugs
at work; of that group, 64 percent said drugs adversely affected
job performance and 44 percent sold drugs to other employees.

Further, a Gallup survey of more than 1,000 U.S. employees shows
97 percent of respondents consider workplace drug testing appropriate
under certain circumstances, i.e., when sufficient evidence
warrants suspicion of drug use.

A comparison of substance abusers vs. nonabusers revealed abusers
were absent from work two and a half times more than nonusers;
productivity of abusers was 25 percent to 33 percent lower;
abusers' off-the-job accidents were four to six times greater;
and their claims for worker compensation were three times greater.
The cost of substance abuse to the collective business community
is estimated to be between $60 billion and $100 billion a year.

But with drug testing comes some problems. Certain methods are
intrusive and physically uncomfortable. Furthermore, some of
the most common methods of testing have been known to produce
false positives: The most reliable drug tests are typically
expensive, ranging from $75 to $200 per test.

In addition, a policy of random or unfair drug testing can create
dissension among employees. In such instances, there's risk
of legal battles. In John's company, applicants are now required
to take a drug test, but testing is not ongoing. "The initial
test would send a strong enough message to our employees."

Develop A Plan of Action

Once you've handled the drug testing issue, determine what action
your company will take if employees violate the drug policy.
Employers are becoming more enlightened about addiction, therefore
many institute supportive programs that allow employees to
seek professional counseling. Be clear on the conditions with
this option: set a time limit; indicate the level of pay you
will provide during the counseling period; and stipulate what
ongoing procedures you will use to monitor compliance with
policies. You also need to research health insurance options.

Be careful to design policies that will stand up in the face
of legal scrutiny. Joseph Ortego, a commercial litigator with
Rivkin, Radler & Kremer, Uniondale, N.Y., says your policy
should state that "action will be sought only after there is
evidence of reasonable probability of drug abuse." For example
 excessive absenteeism, erratic behavior, decline in performance
and independently corroborated reports from reliable sources.
The policies must apply to everyone equally-including yourself.

In John's company, a group of 10 employees formed a task force
to monitor adherence to the new policies, plan drug awareness
programs and resolve conflicts. Some employees were put off
by the new focus on drug abuse prevention.

"I had to explain that this isn't about singling anyone out
to punish them," John says. "It's about maintaining standards
and protecting our workplace. In the long run, this allows
us to be more focused and more profitable."

It wasn't an easy transition. As in many reseller companies,
his employees are close-knit. Many were on board when he founded
the company. John didn't want to upset that dynamic.

For more than two years, Dave's personal battle was affecting
the entire company, John says. It had become a destructive
presence: "It was the single toughest thing my company has
been through." Now that the dust is settling, he feels it was
best that it happened.

"We were closing our eyes to real-world issues, and it bit us
right in the butts. For people who have never experienced this
sort of thing, I'd advise them to prepare now, because it can
be devastating if you don't know what to do."

Customer Speak: What I Want In a VAR

By:
Karen Balch

Odwalla Inc., a juice maker in Half Moon Bay, Calif., knows
how to squeeze out a profit. But Dennis Barr, office systems
manager, says that with only a modest group of MIS people in
house, Odwalla relies on its VAR relationships. Here's what
makes them work.

VARBusiness: How do you choose a VAR?

Barr: First, I have several companies respond to RFPs. That
way, I can make an apples-to-apples comparison. Then I rely
on the word of someone who has used another company, because
that's a firsthand account of how they've performed. That's
the end product-their performance.

VB: What makes a good VAR?

Barr: Responsiveness in support issues would be number one.
When I call, are they there, or do they get back to me in a
reasonable time? I need to have someone I can talk to in less
than half an hour. Support, though, is slightly different.
[It's important that the person] can answer my questions. An
answer to a problem might be good in one environment but not
another.

I need to know I can call 24 hours a day, seven days a week
and get someone who can give me answers. I don't want them
calling me all the time. That can be overbearing. But I'd like
them to check in periodically. I've requested that my two engineers
at Edge [Information Systems, Odwalla's VAR in San Jose] open
an account on my e-mail so I can send them messages, and they
check it daily. That does a lot for me. If I'm having a problem,
they'll know it. Finally, I like information from VARs that
their companies are stable. If one of my engineers gives notice,
I'd like the VAR to not only call me and let me know that I'm
losing one of my support engineers, but also to assure me that
I have another one being brought up to speed.

Program Profiles: CA's Varsity Program Gives Each Player a Fair Turn

By:
Mara Lenuzza

Computer Associates' new VARsity program allows VARs from any
of its existing channel programs to obtain support and expertise
on any of its client-server software products.

The channel programs are segmented by product function: systems
management, database and application development and financial
management. For the most part, the programs had operated independently
from each other and offered varied services. Now VARs can apply
market development funds across the different programs, participate
in trade shows free of charge and access CA's nine testing
and demo centers nationwide.

The program makes it affordable for VARs to cross over into
new or unfamiliar product categories; the cost of enrollment
for any one product-specific program is $2,500. VARsity lets
you join a second program at a 50 percent discount. For subsequent
programs, the fee is waived altogether.

Another change the software giant implemented is the addition
of the Premier program status. The new level supersedes the
existing silver, gold and platinum levels. "Premier partners
will most likely be platinum VARs who are willing to make a
significant financial commitment to us," says Mark Marron,
senior vice president of channel sales.

Premier VARs have exclusive access to CA's video production
studio, marketing team and database. In addition, they receive
perks such as product rebates, VARsity jackets and chances
to win tickets to NBA, NFL and baseball events.

The company, in Islandia, N.Y., is recruiting VARs for the new
program. Existing resellers will automatically be signed on
as VARsity players.

For more information, contact Marron at (516) 342-5224.

Program Profiles: Attachmate Ramps Up Business

By:
Mara Lenuzza

Attachmate Corp. is launching the Remote Access Medallion Program
RAMP-which it hopes will attract VARs currently reselling remote
access products who want to add the Remote LAN Node (RLN) software
suite to their software lineups.

This is an overhaul of what was Digital Communications Associates
Inc.'s VAR program before the company's January 1995 merger
with Attachmate. Now under the Attachmate name, the $390 million
software vendor has made some noteworthy changes. The vendor
now gives a free 8-port product to VARs who complete its $900
training course. Previously, VARs received free training but
were given only two-port products.

In addition, to maintain the integrity of its VAR channel, Attachmate
will more strictly enforce the $40,000 annual volume commitment.

Attachmate has assigned territory sales engineers to answer
questions solely about the RLN suite. Product executives provide
joint sales calls and lead dissemination, and channel account
executives are available via phone to take literature requests
and to assist with the market development funds program.

Attachmate's efforts for the RLN division mostly focus on the
VAR channel. "We sell direct only if it will provide pure convenience
to the end user," says Ana Quintana, channel marketing manager
for RLN, Alpharetta, Ga. Roughly 80 percent of RLN sales go
through the channel.

Quintana says she's looking for VARs that have annual sales
upward of $5 million, have 10 or more employees, are Novell
certified and sell into Fortune 1000 companies. For additional
information, contact her at (770) 442-4220.

Distribution: Financial Planning -- Taxing duties and coping with mergers

By:
Karen Balch

Unpaid Taxes, Increased Margin?

Having distributors drop ship directly to your customers' locations
can save on shipping costs. But if you're not collecting taxes
on those sales, you may be incurring a liability.

Even if you are collecting the taxes, some of your competitors
other VARs and mail-order houses-may not be. As a result, you
may be losing sales based on a perceived cost delta. But the
Computing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), Lombard,
Ill., is lobbying for fairness.

In early 1994, CompTIA supported a bill called the Tax Fairness
for Main Street Business Act. The bill called for any mail
order business doing more than $3 million in annual sales or
with sales into any given state that exceed $100,000 to remit
sales taxes to the state of the products' final destinations.
Passage of the bill would have narrowed the price gap some
mail-order houses currently thrive on. Plus, it would have
provided a standard for collecting those taxes.

The bill failed. But CompTIA plans to support a reintroduction
of the bill soon. Meanwhile, if you don't have a valid reseller
certificate for the state of destinations, distributors such
as Hall-Mark are passing the taxes on to you. As a national
distributor, that's a necessity; as a VAR, it's good business.

Subsidiary Sales: Good and Bad News

What is it with distributors selling off their subsidiaries
lately? MicroAge recently sold Kelly Micro Systems, its memory
subsidiary, to Simple Technology, a memory manufacturer. Last
July, Western Micro Technology sold its semiconductor business
to Reptron Electronics. The sales beg the question: Why buy
subsidiaries such as those in the first place?

The distributors likely perceived a synergy between their businesses
and the subsidiaries they purchased, says Allan Adler, chairman
and CEO of MSI Channel Research & Consulting, Seattle. Kelly
Micro is a memory company and MicroAge sells many computers.
Memory is often in short supply, so the purchase seemed logical.

But, in the memory market, MicroAge couldn't compete with bigger
players such as Kingston and Simple. It just wasn't MicroAge's
core competency to be a memory maker. As a result, MicroAge
has refocused its efforts on doing what it does best.

The industry trend toward selling off such subsidiaries, then,
may be due to two factors: competition and economics. Distributors
and aggregators can't afford to neglect their core competencies.
Given that "distributors haven't been busting the profit envelope
lately," as Adler says, selling businesses that aren't core
is an ideal way to generate capital.

That proved true for Western Micro. The sale of Western Micro's
semiconductor business helped pave the way for its own expansion
and distributor acquisitions. But money was not the driving
factor in the sale of Kelly Micro, according to Wes Richards,
president of MicroAge Channel Services. MicroAge wants to continue
to grow its VAR base, and Richards says that requires a refocusing
of efforts and a shift to a new training and education-oriented
paradigm that will come about this year.

Heads Up: Sales Cycle Is As Sales Cycle Does

By:
Deidra-Ann Parish

In VARBusiness' State of the VAR Market survey, VARs defined
the length of their sales cycles. Contrary to popular theory
that shorter sales cycles are best, profiles of VARs with cycles
of one month or less and those with cycles of six months or
more show each can be successful.

despite the difference in selling prices and revenue, both groups
realize profits. It's apparent that the two business models'
sales strategies complement their sales cycles so each attains
healthy profits.

Industry Watch: Revenge of the Nerds -- Despite bad press, CTOs have become
the darlings of our industry

By:
T.C. Doyle

Which industry terms make your skin crawl? That's one question
we asked in our annual State of the VAR Market survey. While
most of that data was published in our Dec. 15 issue, the answer
to this provocative question was not. "MIPS" is an unpopular
term, which one VAR defined as "Meaningless Indicator of Processor
Speed." Others said they dislike "GUI." Sounds too much like
the stuff that sticks to the floor of the local cinema, they
said.

But we've found that what really peeves VARs is the term "computer
geek." The legendary success of nerd icons Bill Gates, Steve
Case and Marc Andreessen has given rise to the stereotypical
computer nerd. But not without good reason.

Though they might pay less attention to Donna Karan's latest
ready-to-wear collection and log fewer aerobic hours on StairMasters,
the bonafide computer geeks working at VAR businesses have
become the darlings of an industry. Whereas vendors once spent
vast sums courting VAR business owners and sales personnel,
many are now making a direct appeal to the VAR's chief technologist,
more often than not the "computer geek" in residence.

"Within a VAR organization, you can generally identify three
constituents: the VAR business owner, the national sales manager
and the chief technologist," explains John Neilson, vice president
of the organizational business unit at Microsoft. "In past
years, everyone thought the best way to get a VAR behind your
products was by convincing the business owner that you had
the solutions he or she needed," he says. "Or you might have
tried to appeal to the sales manager with a variety of financial
incentives that speak his or her language. But because solutions
have become more complex, the need to rethink this approach
has become apparent."

What Neilson and others have identified is a phenomenon that
is influencing how vendors and distributors recruit, train
and provide financial assistance to VARs. Business owners are,
at heart, pragmatists who will drive their organizations as
business trends and opportunities dictate, while sales managers
will follow money trails and sell whatever makes those cash
registers ring. Increasingly, they both are guided by chief
technologists who introduce their colleagues to new technologies
and products while shielding them from the potential harm of
others.

"We're not out there training the owners [of those resellers],"
says Sun Microsystems chief executive Scott McNealy. "We're
out there training the technologists, the people who are on
the streets in front of the customer. Those are the ones we've
got to get excited about and competent on our technology."

The sales engineers, the field engineers and the technologists
are even more important than the sales reps, he adds. "The
salespeople who are out there making the sale are always looking
to their engineers, their technical support people, saying
'This is right? We can handle this, right?' They need someone
with credibility who can walk in and say 'Yes, we can solve
that problem.'

Ian Bonner, vice president of global channels marketing for
IBM Software, is another channel executive who is spending
more time trying to appeal to chief technology officers. Without
the CTOs' support, IBM's BESTeam VAR program "would not be
firing on all cylinders," Bonner says.

Bonner offers advice on how to woo the individual who can make
a difference. "Step one [in recruiting] is getting the business
owner to say, 'I'm prepared to look at the IBM BESTeam and
software products.' Step two is to get the director of sales
to understand the potential that IBM software products offer
him in making his numbers and achieving his revenue targets,"
he says. "None of those steps can happen, however, until the
technical person within the organization feels comfortable
about making that sales call, about installing the product,
about being able to generate service revenue from the installation
of the products, about supporting the products and about the
combination of the products to provide a solution."

Because vendors are catching on to the influence chief technologists
now wield, more CTOs are turning up at restaurants across the
United States-the pampered guests of those with products to
push. Vendors are keenly aware of whose bread they're buttering.

Ironically, if there is one thing the stereotypical computer
technologist craves less than lunch with strangers, it is probably
a business title that glorifies what he or she does for a living.
Most technologists are known for the long hours they spend
troubleshooting systems or testing software, not the time they
spend trying to glamorize their titles. Hence, vendors are
already lamenting that they are having trouble identifying
who within a VAR organization is the resident chief technologist.
Is it the head service technician? Is it the labs' general
manager or the vice president of systems? It can be all three.
Regardless of their titles, those individuals have become the
"go-to" people for 1996.

Taking Care Of Business: Apart From the Crowd -- To stand out you need a 
unique selling proposition

By:
George Colombo

The Question:

How can my company really distinguish itself?

The Answer:

I've been working with resellers of all types for almost 12
years. In that time, literally every reseller with whom I've
consulted-and there have been thousands-has claimed to be a
provider of superior service and support. Not only is it impossible
for everyone in the business to provide superior service and
support, but also, as far as your customers are concerned,
this claim is meaningless.

Saying you offer superior service makes no significant impression
on customers. "Superiority" in this context does nothing to
differentiate your business from any other.

If you want to make an impression, formulate what marketing
people refer to as a unique selling proposition (USP). Create
a concise statement detailing why a customer should buy from
you instead of your competitors.

First, your USP should focus on a single aspect of your business
that is unique in your marketplace. Second, it should target
a theme that's important to your customer. Finally, your USP
should be as specific as possible.

Perhaps the classic example of a USP is the one upon which Tom
Monaghan built the Domino's Pizza empire: "Fresh, hot pizza
delivered in 30 minutes or less, guaranteed." It satisfies
each USP criterion. A simple, concise statement that focuses
on a single element of the business to the exclusion of all
others.

While there is clearly a vast difference between delivering
high-tech solutions and delivering hot pizza, the principle
is the same. So are the benefits. Spend some time evaluating
your company's function, and you'll be able to devise your
own USP.

In 50 words or less, (1) highlight one unique characteristic
of your business; (2) address an issue important to your customers;
and (3) do this in a way that is specific. If your USP meets
those criteria, you will find that the rest of your marketing
efforts will flow from it easily.

I'd love to see what you come up with. Send me your USP. Perhaps
we will feature some of the best examples in this column. Good
luck.

Comtrol Launches RocketPort

By:
Wendy Sisselman

The RocketPort PCI from Comtrol Corp. uses a PCI bus interface
and is designed to provide a 32-bit access path. Capable of
sustaining ISDN terminal adapters at bonded or compressed speeds,
users can tie into ISDN by joining an Internet service and
connecting an ISDN terminal adapter, such as an external modem,
to the RocketPort. Application-specific integrated circuits
(ASICs) are designed to optimize serial I/O functions by dedicating
one 36-MHz processor to every eight ports (from 8 to 128 ports)
while eliminating the need for the processor, bus interface
and other logic.

Highlights:

 The ASICs designate I/O as their sole task, focusing full processor

Up & Comer: Sky to Earth: You're Covered

By:
T.C. Doyle, Tom Farre and Richard March

Recognize this man? Think he looks a bit like a young Bill Gates?
Well, 24-year-old Sky Dayton is hoping, and his company, Internet
access provider EarthLink Network Inc., is making a run at
our hottest market. Based in Los Angeles and previously targeting
the Left Coast only, EarthLink now has 150 points of presence
for local access around the United States and is reportedly
growing 10 percent a week. Subscribers to Dayton's service
get a free Netscape browser and a free home page-not bad considering
monthly charges as low as $19.95 for unlimited access. Asked
for a quotable company mission statement, something like Gates'
"information at your fingertips," Dayton said, "The Internet
is the most incredible communication medium the world has ever
seen. EarthLink aims to be the dominant Internet access company."
A little wordy, but his heart's in the right place...

Hot Stuff: The 'Universal Client'



It's not Oracle CEO Larry Ellison's $500 Internet box, but maybe
you could call it the enterprise version. The $995 Explora
from X-terminal manufacturer NCD Systems, Mountain View, Calif.,
does a lot of what a low-cost, small footprint PC replacement
should do. Running with NCD's WinCenter Pro multiuser NT software
on a Pentium server, the Explora promises Pentium-like performance
for graphical Windows apps at terminal prices. Plus, NCD's
strong Unix heritage gives the PowerPC-based Explora strong
credentials in the Internet and Unix applications arena. You
can add a floppy drive, CD-ROM and other peripherals to Explora,
which NCD calls the "universal client," but then you're moving
closer to the PCs it could be replacing, so what's the point?

Riding the CTI Technology Explosion -- Maturing, standards-driven
technology sets off a computer telephony boom

By:
Peter Jordan

Howard Lubert almost salivates when he thinks about the numbers:
"Ten million companies in the United States have phone systems,"
says the Philadelphia-area VAR. "The revenue opportunity for
CTI [computer telephone integration] is an even bigger opportunity
than the LAN market back in the '80s, when we started doing
networks." With 1.7 million servers in the United States, Lubert
notes, there are already 1.7 million prospects for CTI, and
the rest of the 10 million could be prospects for both.

"I just can't think of any other market that has this revenue
potential for VARs," adds Lubert, president of HEL Inc., a
systems integration business specializing in turnkey LANs and
network connectivity services.

Recently certified as a CTI engineer, Lubert is spreading the
good news about the huge market potential wherever he can.
As national education chairman of the Business Technology Association,
Kansas City, Mo., he has even prepared two half-day videotapes
on the business of CTI and on implementing CTI.

One VAR he doesn't have to convince is David Condra, president
of Nashville, Tenn.'s Dalcon Computers.

"If you're a solution provider in almost any industry, you're
going to bump into a telephone," says Condra. "We don't see
CTI as an option. It's just a matter of a right opportunity."
Like many VARs, Condra is still waiting to jump in, but he's
keeping his eyes open for the right chance and may consider
partnering with a vendor to get into the market.

Market researchers bear out the optimism of VARs like Lubert
and Condra. "The components needed to fuel exciting CTI growth
are finally in place," says Gary L. Andresen, an analyst at
Dataquest Inc., San Jose, Calif. Andresen expects the total
U.S. market for CTI to grow from $1.48 billion in 1995 to $7.91
billion in 1999, an annual rate of about 50 percent.

An exclusive CRN/VARBusiness survey of 300 managers in midsize
companies in a mix of industries confirms CTI's promise. Though
only 9.3 percent are already invested in CTI technology, 49
applications percent more plan to invest over the next two
years. Although fax solutions like fax broadcast and fax on
demand are the most popular computer telephony today, the technology
for far more complex CTI solutions has ripened.

CTI Saves Time and Money

Computer telephone integration is just what the name suggests
technology integrating the two most important information systems
of most businesses: telephone systems and computers. It ranges
from a stand-alone desktop system enabling a user to dial by
clicking on an on-screen phone number, to voice-processing
subsystems that automate customer service, to complex call
center operations integrating the functions of a client/server
network and a multiline PBX switch.

Anyone who does a lot of business over the telephone is a potential
CTI customer. The most obvious competitive benefit of CTI is
that it saves time-and time, as the clich says, is money.

If you simply click on a name or number rather than dial it,
you save several seconds-especially if a sequence of long-distance
carrier-access and credit-card numbers is involved.

"When I'm dialing from my home office, I use my Sprint card,"
says Buz Brooks, director of CTI for Norstan Integration Services,
a $300 million VAR in Maple Grove, Minn., that started as a
telephone interconnect company but has evolved into systems
integration. "It takes 30-some-odd digits to do it manually,
but if I'm using my desktop PC and ACT! [contact management
software], I bring up the name, hit alternative access, click,
and it's dialing."

Users can save a lot more time with inbound calls, especially
if their computer tells who's calling them and retrieves the
caller's record before they even answer the phone.

How much time and money a business can save depends on the kind
of calls it handles. "If you take a lot of short calls, and
CTI saves you 15 percent on a 1-minute call, that's a big savings,
especially if you have 800 lines," Brooks says. "But saving
15 seconds on a 40-minute call obviously isn't a big percentage."

Far more important than the cost of the 800 service, of course,
is the cost of an employee's time. If you can help a registered
nurse handling insurance inquiries to work 25 percent more
efficiently, you've created a major reason to install a CTI
system.

Servicing the Customer

Beyond the efficiency improvements CTI enables are the re-engineering
possibilities of tying a phone system to a computer system.
CTI enables phone-intensive businesses to give customers individual
attention and boost employee productivity.

Brooks is working with a customer that has a wide mix of clientele,
from elderly to quite young. Callers can set up their accounts
so they do all their business automatically with an interactive
voice response (IVR) system, or so that they always talk to
a customer-service representative (CSR), as is generally preferred
by older customers.

Caller ID or Automatic Number Identification (ANI) can be an
important part of a CTI system that handles inbound calls,
letting the computer system identify a caller and retrieve
his or her record before the phone is even answered. Caller
ID is an embedded analog signal available from the local phone
company that arrives between the first and second ring, whereas
ANI arrives on a separate digital channel with 800 service
and some other long-distance calls.

"If you get a hit on the caller ID or ANI, you go to the computer
and say, 'Here's Jane Doe's record. What's our strategy for
Jane Doe?' You can get down to individual marketing," Brooks
explains.

"The customer-contact strategy might be that if I call on the
800 line for delivery information, I might want to be sent
to a voice response system, where I can key in a number and
get an instant status report," says Brooks.

When CTI systems can do such intelligent routing, sales and
marketing executives tend to get excited.

The time is ripe for VARs and integrators to get into telephony.
For starters, standards are emerging-including TAPI for the
desktop, TSAPI for the LAN, and SCSA for multivendor hardware
software integration. And the once-proprietary world of PBX
switches is opening up, in a development similar to what happened
to mainframe computer vendors when they were forced to move
to open systems.

Change Is Coming

"Proprietary technologies have provided a measure of security
and safeguards to the vendors in that industry," says Mike
Munsch, executive vice president of R.W. Bennett Corp., a VAR
in Raleigh, N.C. "They felt that as long as they had proprietary
technology, they didn't have to be price-competitive, but change
is going to happen."

"This technology has been in use for quite a while, but it's
been very convoluted," explains Chuck Smith, executive vice
president of Dialogic Communications Corp. of Franklin, Tenn.,
a VAR specializing in voice processing systems. "Now our computer
can talk directly to the computer inside the PBX. This makes
things much more efficient, and manufacturers are making prices
much more reasonable."

Beyond the emerging plug-and-play TAPI products for the individual
desktop, CTI is an attractive VAR opportunity because it usually
involves consultative selling and long-term relationships.
Many CTI solutions are scalable, enabling a VAR to start out
providing a customer with a CTI solution for a single telephone
intensive department, then move out into the corporation and
implement CTI on virtually every desktop that has a workstation
and a telephone.

"An installation can be from as small as a half-dozen agents
on up to thousands," says Ron Charnock, president and CEO of
NPRI Inc. of Fairfax, Va., a call-center solution provider
that has been doing CTI installations since 1986. "The technology
is very scalable today, but that wasn't the case five or six
years ago. It's a good time for people to get into CTI, because
the initial market education has been done, and stable products
are out there."

The Customer for Computer Telephony - The profile is broad,
since telephon productivity is mission-control for most businesses

By:
Peter Jordan

Early CTI adopters were companies like airlines, with massive
call-center operations based on mainframes and proprietary
links to PBX switches. Today, though, since the technology
is becoming more affordable and scalable, thousands of potential
customers exist.

Even though only 9.3 percent of the users surveyed by CRN/VARBusiness
research are already invested in CTI, a large majority consider
CTI's desktop productivity features useful. More than 80 percent
consider fax functions useful, while 75 percent would enjoy
integrated messaging-the ability to access phone, voice-mail
and fax messages from a PC.

More than half say retrieving E-mail by phone, sending E-mail
to remote locations, and using graphical software to operate
their phones would be useful.

On the networked CTI side, most managers consider a variety
of computer telephony functions very useful in improving customer
service- things like automatic faxing after phone conversations,
screen pops of all customer records as a call comes in, and
the ability to gather information from customers while they
are on hold. More than a third of managers believe the ability
to record personalized greetings for customers would be very
useful, as would the ability to record customer service or
sales conversations.

As promising as this sounds, there is no single market for CTI,
according to VARs who have been selling it. CTI is a land of
a thousand niches, says Ron Charnock of solution provider NPRI
Inc., Fairfax, Va.

"There's not going to be just one CTI market," he says. "It's
a thousand niches defined by the specific solution you bring."
The more mission-critical a company's telephone activity is,
the more value the user can realize from CTI.

The most obvious target, explains Charnock, is the typical call
center operation, such as QVC Home Shopping Network or the
call centers of Louisville, Ky.-based health-care giant Humana,
which have about 600 or 700 employees handling customer service.

Charnock's firm did the Humana installation. "They handle HMO
work, customer service, and new subscribers, so they're back
ending a lot of the 800-number activity they do for advertising,
setting appointments for their field people, and doing a variety
of different things for their customer service centers," he
says.

For most call centers, CTI technology is now a must-have item.
Ripe targets include financial services and telecommunications
providers. "It's at the point where people in almost any midsize
company recognize the concept and understand the value proposition,"
says Charnock.

The debt collection agency of France-based COFIDIS-the financial
subsidiary of 3 Suisses International, a leading French mail
order company-has 100 agents averaging 5,000 outbound calls
a day. Using predictive dialing technology, the system launches
calls and monitors their progress so only the connected calls
are routed to the CSRs.

As soon as the system gets a "hit," it pops the client's account
on the CSR's screen and connects the phone call. Gone are the
days when CSRs wasted their time on manual dialing, no answers,
disconnected phones and answering machines.

A pay-per-view cable-TV supplier is an obvious target for CTI,
says Bart Stanco, vice president of the Gartner Group market
research firm, Stamford, Conn. "A customer calls to order a
pay-per-view heavyweight fight. We automatically check your
balance, and if you're overdue, we transfer you to accounts
payable instead," he says.

Chuck Smith, executive vice president of Dialogic Communications
Corp., Franklin, Tenn., says his company installs systems in
nuclear power plants that automatically dial employees and
emergency personnel in the event of an emergency, then screen
inbound calls so harried managers can know whether someone
important is calling in the midst of the emergency.

In the classic John Naisbitt phrase, CTI technology allows a
"high tech, high touch" approach that uses automation to treat
customers individually. An airline might move a million- mile
frequent flier ahead in the phone queue past someone whose
only contact with the airline has been a $59 super-saver ticket,
Stanco suggests.

In environments like help desks, customers who call back a few
minutes after a previous call should probably be automatically
routed to the technician they talked with before, because they
probably have additional questions about the same problem.
CTI would enable such routing.

Almost all catalog houses route customers differently based
on age, says Stanco, automatically sending over-40 customers
to live CSRs and the under-40 crowd to an IVR system.

ANI and caller ID are of most use today in a home-to-business
environment like QVC rather than business to business. In most
cases, when someone calls from a large business PBX, ANI cannot
identify the individual caller and may not even be able to
identify the business.

The High-Tech Way to "Hold the Anchovie

By:
Peter Jordan

When you call a Domino's store and order a pizza, the employee
may ask your name and address, but in most cases, it's already
on a computer screen. Between the first and second rings, an
interface unit detects an embedded analog caller ID signal
and feeds it into a 486 PC. Using your phone number as its
primary key, the database in the 486 retrieves your record
and pops it onto the screen before the order taker can even
say, "Domino's Pizza. Can you hold?"

It doesn't take a genius to figure out the value of automating
the retrieval of that kind of information and placing it in
front of employees before they answer the call. For starters,
in addition to saving time, you've got a lot better chance
of getting that sausage pizza topped with peppers and mushrooms
to the right door if the driver is reading from a clearly legible
printout rather than a hand-scribbled or manually typed order
sheet.

"It cuts way down on mistakes like typing errors," says Tim
Monteith, vice president, information services, at Domino's
corporate headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich. "But it also allows
us to store special instructions like 'Go to the side door
and honk,'" Monteith says.

"It also helps in situations like high school kids ordering
10 anchovy pizzas delivered to their principal and giving me
an address different from what's on the screen," Monteith adds.

Beginning in 1993 and finishing last year, Domino's installed
the system in all 700 corporate-owned stores. Many of its 3,500
independently owned franchises also use the system.

"The new system saves time, increases accuracy and allows much
more complete management information," says Monteith. "It's
a lot easier to train new employees, and the calculations are
done correctly, including taxes."

Because the system stores a customer's previous orders, "We
get some college kids who think it's cool to simply say 'the
usual' and hang up," Monteith chuckles. "But we're not supposed
to do it that way."

Although employees could actually greet customers by name before
they identify themselves, Monteith says it would appear "invasive"
to do so, so employees are instructed to ask who you are when
you call, even though they already know.

While the order-taking system is the most visible aspect of
the automation of a Domino's store, "Many other things are
happening behind the scenes," says Monteith. "The system is
calculating the time it takes to make the pizza, it's serving
as a time clock for employees, it's running the payroll, it's
tracking food costs, and it's transmitting all that information
to the home office."

Your neighborhood pizza parlor may seem an unlikely location
for state-of-the-art automation, but Domino's has figured out
how to use computer telephone integration and a plain old point
of-sale system running on a 486 PC with multiple terminals
to achieve the kind of MIS controls and efficiencies much larger
operations are still dreaming about.

How to Make The Computer Telephony Sale -- VARs who have been
there suggest finding a champion and layering solutions from
the desktop

By:
Peter Jordan

Despite the obvious theoretical advantages of CTI for most telephone
intensive businesses, it's still not an easy sale.

As with any new technology, VARs face potential end-user skepticism
 89 percent of the users queried in the CRN/VARBusiness survey
said high reliability was a very important technical attribute,
meaning the first challenge is to convince customers the technology
will work as promised.

Customers also want to be sure any CTI installation is upgradable,
uses industry standards, requires low maintenance, is expandable,
and is compatible with existing telephone systems. If this
seems like a tall order, one bright spot is that less than
half of users expect a CTI solution to use components from
leading vendors. In other words, VARs can resell products from
new and emerging companies, so long as they meet other customer
requirements.

When NPRI Inc., Fairfax, Va., made its first CTI sale to health
care giant Humana, Louisville, Ky., the telecommunications
staff did not believe the system really worked, says NPRI president
and CEO Ron Charnock. "They literally traced the cables between
the computers and the telephone system," he recalls. "A person
with 30 years of telecommunications experience didn't believe
you could hook up a computer and a phone."

St. Louis Novell integrator Bill Barry of MJB Associates, just
now getting into networked CTI, says his first step is to install
a system in his own business and work out the bugs. "You've
absolutely got to do this," he says. "I don't know anything
in this business where you can fake your way through it."

Once he gets an in-house system up and running, it will be a
starting point for sales demonstrations to potential customers.

The fact that users in the CRN/ VARBusiness survey also place
a high value on user friendliness and on excellent support
and maintenance is further indication that they want a lot
of hand-holding as they move into the unexplored territory
of CTI.

Another obstacle to a CTI sale is that it requires bridging
a major gap between two separate technological cultures, telephony
and MIS.

The consensus seems to be that misunderstandings are rampant
between computer and telephony user cultures, and that VARs
need the skills of a multilingual diplomat to go between them.
Take a term like "terminal equipment." To a computer professional,
that means a screen and a keyboard, but to a telephone expert
it's anything that plugs into the public network. "If you plug
the world's biggest supercomputer into the network, it's just
a terminal to the phone guy," says one industry watcher.

The term "reliability" is another chance for misunderstanding
 While the computer side might brag about 99 percent availability,
a telephone pro whose system was up only 99 percent of the
time would get fired very quickly.

"I don't see it as 'us against them,'" says Susan Mills, principal
of Technology Marketing Partners, a CTI consultancy in Berkeley,
Calif. "The one who has the advantage is the one who can most
completely satisfy the needs of the customer and think broadest
and most long-term about those needs. I don't see a technology
bias driving that: I see that as a business-practices bias."

But the gap isn't just cultural; it can be technological as
well. Gartner Group research finds that systems-management
complexity and costs increase 9 to 28 percent with a CTI installation.
"The problem centers around a dual database for configuration,
administration, and management," says Bart Stanco, vice presi
 dent at Gartner.

To help bridge the gap between the two cultures and technologies,
computer VARs and integrators that are serious about making
a major play for the CTI market should consider either hiring
telephony expertise or partnering with firms with mastery of
the field.

Randall Bennett of R.W. Bennett Co., Raleigh, N.C., recruited
Mike Munsch, who used to own a telephone interconnect company
and serves on the board of the North American Telecommunications
Association, to add telephony expertise to his traditional
Novell Platinum business.

Bennett's first CTI sale was automation of a support center
for a company that does independent software support for Fortune
500 companies. The major reason the sale went through was that
R.W. Bennett teamed with the local AT&T office to develop the
solution.

"At this point, no one can go in and offer an all-encompassing
solution," Munsch says. "Companies need to learn how to partner.
In the computer industry, VARs have done that for a long time,
but I know from personal experience that the telecommunications
industry never has done that. Not only did they not partner,
but they saw everyone as competitors."

But the alternatives for AT&T with the Raleigh help desk operation
were either partnering or no sale, says Bennett: "We were talking
about a half-million-dollar system. The local rep wanted the
sale. It worked great-both of us got business we wouldn't have
gotten."

MJB's Barry suggests two groups of customers are particularly
ripe for a CTI sale: Customers who still have no voice-mail
system at all, so they'll soon be making a major investment
in telephone equipment, and customers "who are so annoyed at
their interconnect provider they want to throw their whole
phone system out."

Return on investment in a call-center operation is relatively
easy to demonstrate: It's obvious, for example, that if a screen
of information reaches CSRs at the same time as a call, CSRs
will be able to process significantly more calls than if they
have to first figure out who's calling and then manually retrieve
a record.

Demonstrating such ROI is important to making the CTI sale:
More than 60 percent of users expect a fast payback on CTI,
according to CRN/VARBusiness research.

Find Your Champion

But with management and knowledge workers, the benefits of CTI
can be more subtle, requiring a long sales cycle and a thorough
understanding of the way the user does business.

"In my mind, you should sell to the person in the organization
who's going to use it," says Munsch, who for years went to
the MIS or telecommunications department and sold them what
they thought they needed. But the problem with CTI, he says,
is that it's not an essential service and it's not universal.
It benefits only a certain portion of the company.

"The guy in the warehouse doesn't need it," Munsch says, "so
you're going to have to sell it to the manager of the department
that will use it, and that manager has to feel so strongly
that it's going to benefit their department that they're willing
to champion it, go to the telecommunications manager and MIS
manager, and say, 'I need you guys to work together.' You have
to involve people who will be the champions."

CRN/VARBusiness research suggests that one way to find your
champions is to convince them of your excellent customer support
 More than 80 percent of users expect that from a CTI supplier.
A majority also need you to understand their business model,
and to offer local support and the ability to customize the
system you sell. Only 16 percent demand a supplier they have
worked with before, indicating opportunities for VARs reaching
out to new CTI customers.

Overcoming technological inertia is a problem, though, since
telecommunications managers typically like the status quo.

Begin with the user, not the technology center, advises consultant
Mills. "The whole point is to become a strategic ally with
end users." A CTI implementation will become an expensive boondoggle
if you don't have buy-in from whomever will actually benefit
from the technology right from the beginning.

The Layered Look

One way to create an appetite for a full-blown, network-based
CTI solution is to try to get customers to use simple plug
and-play desktop solutions like autodialing, suggests Buz Brooks
of Norstan Integration Services, Maple Grove, Minn. "It's important
to get something up and running quickly that people can use,"
he says. "Then it's kind of like an onion skin. You start layering
more capabilities."

The next step might be software that lets users control all
communications functions from a single graphical interface.
Integrated messaging, where the screen shows all voice, fax
and E-mail messages on a single screen, allows the users to
choose which ones to read first.

Also possible are several types of fax and voice processing
systems, which either improve customer service or increase
employee productivity by automating information and account
functions when customers or suppliers call in.

A full-blown CTI implementation is a consultative solution sale
that often involves business re-engineering, warns the Gartner
Group's Stanco. "It's not all plug-and-play. It's more like
build-and-sweat," he says. But the payoffs in value-added sales
and long-term customer relationships will be worth the sweat
for VARs who build their way into the explosive CTI market
at the right time, with the right resources and the right partners.

Personalized Marketing for Every Customer

By:
Peter Jordan

Computer telephone integration (CTI) allows businesses to micro
market to each individual customer, says Barnett Bezme, director
of sales and marketing for New York-based Amarex Technology
Inc., which has been integrating midsize to large call centers
for the past 10 years.

With a typical Amarex customer like New York's Chemical Bank,
Amarex's first sale is an interactive voice response (IVR)
system, the application that allows customers to punch numbers
on a phone in response to a recorded menu tree to find out
such information as their account balance.

"At Chemical Bank, 80 percent of the calls go through an IVR
system, and the customers are totally satisfied," Bezme says.
"The other 20 percent go to an agent."

The installation of an IVR system for an end user like Chemical
Bank "is a no-brainer in terms of return on investment," says
Bezme. "When you can handle 80 percent of 3 million calls a
month without human intervention, it will pay back within a
month."

Once he installs an IVR system, Bezme is in a prime position
to get the end user to consider CTI for the calls the automated
attendant can't handle. It's when you add the CTI on top of
IVR that you begin to realize the micro-marketing potential
of a marriage between the phone system and the customer database,
Bezme explains. Once the system identifies a customer-either
through caller ID or an identification number-you can send
a picture of the customer's relationship with the bank to the
agent.

The system does a security check, then puts a history of the
call on the customer service representative's screen.

Once you match an inbound call to a customer record, "a lot
of sophistication is possible," Bezme points out. "If you're
Spanish-speaking, I might have a key on the host database record
routing you to a Spanish-speaking representative, or you might
be a Gold Card member."

The best kind of customer for CTI-based micro-marketing is a
repeat customer, says Bezme. Every time the customer contacts
your business, you can build more details into the record.

Although Amarex works at the implementation level rather than
the strategic level, the technology enables business re-engineering,
so Amarex often partners with SHL System House, a nationwide
systems integrator.

Reference selling is important within each vertical, says Bezme:
A bank wants to see an IVR system working in another bank,
even though it may be the same technology an insurance company's
customer service department uses.

His advice for VARs entering the CTI marketplace? "Find a partner
and go slow. When you go into a mainframe, it's a lot more
complicated than it looks, and when you talk to a switch, every
switch has a different protocol."
