<p>
INTRODUCTION
</center> 
 
<p>
   Apple Computer, Inc. appeals from the district court's denial of a motion to
preliminarily enjoin Franklin Computer Corp. from infringing the copyrights 
Apple holds on fourteen computer programs. 
 
   The decision to grant or refuse to grant a preliminary injunction
is within the discretion of the district court.  <em>See A.O. Smith
Corp</em>. v. <em>FTC</em>, 530 F.2d 515, 525 (3d Cir. 1976). Although the
scope of our review of the action of the district court in ruling on a
motion for preliminary injunction is narrow, reversal is warranted if
the trial court has abused its discretion or committed error in
applying the law.  <em>Kennecott Corp</em>. v. <em>Smith</em>, 637 F.2d
181, 187 (3d Cir.  1980). As the Second Circuit has stated recently,
``Despite oft repeated statements that the issuance of a preliminary
injunction rests in the discretion of the trial judge whose decisions
will be reversed only for `abuse', a court of appeals must reverse if
the district court has proceeded on the basis of an erroneous view of
the applicable law.'' <em>Donovan</em> v. <em>Bierwirth</em>, 680 F.2d 263,
269 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 459 U.S. 1069, 103 S. Ct. 488, 74
L. Ed. 2d 631 (1982).
 
   In this case the district court denied the preliminary injunction,
<em>inter alia</em>, because it had ``some doubt as to the
copyrightability of the programs.''  <em>Apple Computer, Inc</em>. v.
<em>Franklin Computer Corp</em>., 545 F. Supp. 812, 812 (E.D. Pa.
1982). This legal ruling is fundamental to all future proceedings in
this action and, as the parties and amici curiae seem to agree, has
considerable significance to the computer services
industry.<a name="F1"><a href="#FN1"><sup><fontsize=-2>1</font></sup></a></a>
Because we conclude that the district court proceeded under an erroneous
view of the applicable law, we reverse the denial of the preliminary
injunction and remand.

<p>
FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY 
</center>
 
<p>
   Apple, one of the computer industry leaders, manufactures and markets 
personal computers (microcomputers), related peripheral equipment such as disk 
drives (peripherals), and computer programs (software).  It presently 
manufactures Apple II computers and distributes over 150 programs.  Apple has 
sold over 400,000 Apple II computers, employs approximately 3,000 people, and 
had annual sales of $335,000,000 for fiscal year 1981.  One of the by-products 
of Apple's success is the independent development by third parties of numerous 
computer programs which are designed to run on the Apple II computer. 
    
 
   Franklin, the defendant below, manufactures and sells the ACE 100 personal 
computer and at the time of the hearing employed about 75 people and had sold 
fewer than 1,000 computers.  The ACE 100 was designed to be ``Apple compatible,'' 
so that peripheral equipment and software developed for use with the Apple II 
computer could be used in conjunction with the ACE 100.  Franklin's copying of 
Apple's operating system computer programs in an effort to achieve such 
compatibility precipitated this suit. 
 
   Like all computers both the Apple II and ACE 100 have a central processing 
unit (CPU) which is the integrated circuit that executes programs.  In lay terms, 
the CPU does the work it is instructed to do.  Those instructions are contained 
on computer programs. 
 
   There are three levels of computer language in which computer programs may be 
written.<a name="F2"><a href="#FN2"><sup><fontsize=-2>2</font></sup></a></a> High level language, such as the commonly used BASIC or FORTRAN, 
uses English words and symbols, and is relatively easy to learn and understand 
(e.g., ``GO TO 40'' tells the computer to skip intervening steps and go to the 
step at line 40).  A somewhat lower level language is assembly language, which 
consists of alphanumeric labels (e.g., ``ADC'' means ``add with carry''). 
Statements in high level language, and apparently also statements in assembly 
language, are referred to as written in ``source code.'' The third, or lowest 
level computer language, is machine language, a binary language using two 
symbols, 0 and 1, to indicate an open or closed switch (e.g., ``01101001'' means, 
to the Apple, add two numbers and save the result).  Statements in machine 
language are referred to as written in ``object code.''  
 
    
 
   The CPU can only follow instructions written in object code.  However, 
programs are usually written in source code which is more intelligible to 
humans.  Programs written in source code can be converted or translated by a 
``compiler'' program into object code for use by the computer.  Programs are 
generally distributed only in their object code version stored on a memory 
device. 
 
   A computer program can be stored or fixed on a variety of memory devices, two 
of which are of particular relevance for this case.  The ROM (Read Only Memory) 
is an internal permanent memory device consisting of a semi-conductor ``chip'' 
which is incorporated into the circuitry of the computer.  A program in object 
code is embedded on a ROM before it is incorporated in the computer. 
Information stored on a ROM can only be read, not erased or rewritten.<a name="F3"><a href="#FN3"><sup><fontsize=-2>3</font></sup></a></a> The 
ACE 100 apparently contains EPROMS (Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) on 
which the stored information can be erased and the chip reprogrammed, but the 
district court found that for purposes of this proceeding, the difference 
between ROMs and EPROMs is inconsequential.  545 F. Supp. at 813 n.3. The other 
device used for storing the programs at issue is a diskette or ``floppy disk'', an 
auxiliary memory device consisting of a flexible magnetic disk resembling a 
phonograph record, which can be inserted into the computer and from which data 
or instructions can be read. 
 
    
 
   Computer programs can be categorized by function as either application 
programs or operating system programs.  Application programs usually perform a 
specific task for the computer user, such as word processing, checkbook 
balancing, or playing a game.  In contrast, operating system programs generally 
manage the internal functions of the computer or facilitate use of application 
programs.  The parties agree that the fourteen computer programs at      
issue in this suit are operating system programs.<a name="F4"><a href="#FN4"><sup><fontsize=-2>4</font></sup></a></a> 
 
   Apple filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District 
of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1338 on May 12, 1982, alleging that 
Franklin was liable for copyright infringement of the fourteen computer 
programs, patent infringement, unfair competition, and misappropriation. 
Franklin's answer in respect to the copyright counts included the affirmative 
defense that the programs contained no copyrightable subject matter.  Franklin 
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment that the copyright registrations were 
invalid and unenforceable, and sought affirmative relief on the basis of Apple's 
alleged misuse.  Franklin also moved to dismiss eleven of the fourteen copyright 
infringement counts on the ground that Apple failed to comply with the 
procedural requirements for suit under 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 410, 411.      
 
   After expedited discovery, Apple moved for a preliminary injunction
to restrain Franklin from using, copying, selling, or infringing
Apple's copyrights.  The district court held a three day evidentiary
hearing limited to the copyright infringement claims.  Apple produced
evidence at the hearing in the form of affidavits and testimony that
programs sold by Franklin in conjunction with its ACE 100 computer
were virtually identical with those covered by the fourteen Apple
copyrights.  The variations that did exist were minor, consisting
merely of such things as deletion of reference to Apple or its
copyright notice.<a name="F5"><a href="#FN5"><sup><fontsize=-2>5</font></sup></a></a> James Huston, an Apple systems
programmer, concluded that the Franklin programs were ``unquestionably
copied from Apple and could not have been independently created.'' He
reached this conclusion not only because it is ``almost impossible for
so many lines of code'' to be identically written, but also because his
name, which he had embedded in one program (Master Create), and the
word ``Applesoft'', which was embedded in another (DOS 3.3), appeared
on the Franklin master disk.  Apple estimated the ``works in suit''
took 46 man-months to produce at a cost of over $740,000, not
including the time or cost of creating or acquiring earlier versions
of the programs or the expense of marketing the programs.

<p>   Franklin did not dispute that it copied the Apple programs.  Its witness 
admitted copying each of the works in suit from the Apple programs.  Its factual 
defense was directed to its contention that it was not feasible for Franklin to 
write its own operating system programs.  David McWherter, now Franklin's 
vice-president of engineering, testified he spent 30-40 hours in November 1981 
making a study to determine if it was feasible for Franklin to write its own 
Autostart ROM program and concluded it was not because ``there were just too many 
entry points in relationship to the number of instructions in the program.'' 
Entry points at specific locations in the program can be used by programmers to 
mesh their application programs with the operating system program.  McWherter 
concluded that use of the identical signals was necessary in order to ensure 
100% compatibility with application programs created to run on the Apple 
computer.  He admitted that he never attempted to rewrite Autostart ROM and 
conceded that some of the works in suit (<em>i.e.</em>  Copy, Copy A, Master Create, and 
Hello) probably could have been rewritten by Franklin.  Franklin made no attempt 
to rewrite any of the programs prior to the lawsuit except for Copy, although 
McWherter testified that Franklin was ``in the process of redesigning'' some of 
the Apple programs and that ``[w]e had a fair degree of certainty that that would 
probably work.'' Apple introduced evidence that Franklin could have rewritten 
programs, including the Autostart ROM program, and that there are in existence 
operating programs written by third parties which are compatible with Apple II. 
 
   Franklin's principal defense at the preliminary injunction hearing and before 
us is primarily a legal one, directed to its contention that the Apple operating 
system programs are not capable of copyright protection. 
 
   The district court denied the motion for preliminary injunction by order and
opinion dated July 30, 1982.  Apple moved for reconsideration in light of this 
court's decision in <em>Williams Electronics, Inc</em>. v. <em>Artic International, Inc</em>., 685 
F.2d 870 (3d Cir. 1982), which was decided August 2, 1982, three days after the 
district court decision.  The district court denied the motion for 
reconsideration.  We have jurisdiction of Apple's appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
&#167; 1292(a)(1).

<p>
III. 
<p> 
THE DISTRICT COURT OPINION
</center> 
 
<p>
   In its opinion, the district court referred to the four factors to be 
considered on request for a preliminary injunction: a reasonable 
probability of success on the merits; irreparable injury; the improbability of 
harm to other interested persons; and the public interest.  545 F. Supp. at 825; 
see <em>Delaware River Port Authority</em> v. <em>Transamerican Trailer Transport, Inc</em>., 501 
F.2d 917, 919--20 (3d Cir. 1974). The court stated it based its denial of the 
motion on the first two factors.  The court held Apple had not made the 
requisite showing of likelihood of success on the merits because it ``concluded 
that there is some doubt as to the copyrightability of the programs described in 
this litigation.'' 545 F. Supp. at 812. It also stated that ``Apple is better 
suited to withstand whatever injury it might sustain during litigation than is 
Franklin to withstand the effects of a preliminary injunction'' because an 
injunction would have a ``devastating effect'' on Franklin's business, <em>id</em>. at 825, 
apparently concluding on that basis that Apple had failed to show irreparable 
harm. 
 
   It is difficult to discern precisely why the district court questioned the 
copyrightability of the programs at issue since there is no finding, statement, 
or holding on which we can focus which clearly sets forth the district court's 
view.  Throughout the opinion the district court referred to the ``complexity of 
the question presented by the present case'', 545 F. Supp. at 824, and the 
``baffling'' problem at issue.  <em>Id</em>. at 822. 
 
   The opinion expresses a series of generalized concerns which may have led the 
court to its ultimate conclusion, and which the parties and amici treat as 
holdings.  The district court referred to the requirement under the Copyright 
Act of finding ``original works of authorship'', 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a), and seems to 
have found that there was a sufficient ``modicum of creativity'' to satisfy the 
statutory requirement of an ``original work''.  545 F. Supp. at 820--21. The court 
was less clear as to whether the creation of a computer program by a programmer 
satisfied the requirement of ``works of authorship'', <em>id</em>., and whether an 
operating system program in ``binary code or one represented either in a ROM or 
by micro-switches'' was an ``expression'' which could be copyrighted as 
distinguished from an ``idea'' which could not be.  <em>Id</em>. at 821. 
 
   Again, although we cannot point to a specific holding, running throughout the 
district court opinion is the suggestion that programs in object code and ROMs 
may not be copyrightable.  Thus, for example, in a series of discursive 
footnotes, the district court stated that it found ``persuasive'' a district court 
opinion ``holding that object code in ROM is not copyright protected'', 545 F. 
Supp. at 818 n.8 (referring to <em>Data Cash Systems, Inc</em>. v. <em>JS&A Group, Inc.</em>, 480 
F. Supp. 1063 (N.D.Ill. 1979), <em>aff'd on other grounds</em>, 628 F.2d 1038 (7th Cir. 
1980)); described an opinion reaching a contrary conclusion as containing 
``rather terse analysis [which] provides little guidance'', 545 F. Supp. at 818 
n.8 (referring to <em>GCA Corp</em>. v. <em>Chance</em>, 217 U.S.P.Q. 718 (N.D.Cal. 1982), which 
followed the reasoning of <em>Tandy Corp</em>. v. <em>Personal Micro Computers, Inc</em>., 524 F. 
Supp. 171 (N.D.Cal. 1981)); and stated that ``Congressional intent regarding the 
copyrightability of object codes and ROMs is not clear'', 545 F. Supp. at 819 
n.9, and that even among members of the industry it was not clear that the 
copyright law protects works ``like those in suit that are ROM-based,'' <em>id</em>. at 819 
n.10. 
 
   We read the district court opinion as presenting the following legal issues:
(1) whether copyright can exist in a computer program expressed in object code,
(2) whether copyright can exist in a computer program embedded on a ROM, (3) 
whether copyright can exist in an operating system program, and (4) whether 
independent irreparable harm must be shown for a preliminary injunction in 
copyright infringement actions.

IV.

<p> 
DISCUSSION 

<p>A.
 <p>
<em>Copyrightability of a Computer Program</em><br>
<em>Expressed in Object Code</em> 
</center>
 
<p>
   Certain statements by the district court suggest that programs expressed in 
object code, as distinguished from source code, may not be the 
proper subject of copyright.  We find no basis in the statute for any such 
concern.  Furthermore, our decision in <em>Williams Electronics, Inc</em>. v. <em>Artic 
International, Inc., supra</em>, laid to rest many of the doubts expressed by the 
district court. 
 
   In 1976, after considerable study, Congress enacted a new copyright law to 
replace that which had governed since 1909.  Act of October 19, 1976, Pub. L. No. 
94--553, 90 Stat. 2541 (<em>codified</em> at 17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101 <em>et seq</em>.).  Under the law, 
two primary requirements must be satisfied in order for a work to constitute 
copyrightable subject matter---it must be an ``original wor[k] of authorship'' 
and must be ``fixed in [a] tangible medium of expression.'' 17 U.S.C. &#167; 102(a). 
The statute provides:

<p><blockquote>  
   (a) Copyright protection subsists, in accordance with this title, in original 
works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, now known or 
later developed, from which they can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise 
communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.
</blockquote>
 
   <em>Id</em>.  The statute enumerates seven categories under ``works of authorship'' 
including ``literary works'', defined as follows:

<p><blockquote> 
   ``Literary works'' are works, other than audiovisual works, expressed in words, 
numbers, or other verbal or numerical symbols or indicia, regardless of the 
nature of the material objects, such as books, periodicals, manuscripts, 
phonorecords, film, tapes, disks, or cards, in which they are embodied.
</blockquote> 
 
   17 U.S.C. &#167; 101.A work is ``fixed'' in a tangible medium of expression when: 
 
<blockquote>
   its embodiment in a copy or phonorecord, by or under the authority of the 
author, is sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, 
reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory 
duration.  A work consisting of sounds, images, or both, that are being 
transmitted, is ``fixed'' for purposes of this title if a fixation of the work is
being made simultaneously with its transmission.
</blockquote> 
 
   <em>Id</em>. 
 
   Although section 102(a) does not expressly list computer programs
as works of authorship, the legislative history suggests that programs
were considered copyrightable as literary works.  <em>See</em>
H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 54, <em>reprinted in</em> 1976
U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News 5659, 5667 (``literary works' ...
includes ... computer programs'').  Because a Commission on New
Technological Uses (``CONTU'') had been created by Congress to study,
<em>inter alia</em>, computer uses of copyrighted works, Pub. L. No.
93--573, &#167; 201, 88 Stat. 1873 (1974), Congress enacted a status quo
provision, section 117, in the 1976 Act concerning such computer uses
pending the CONTU report and recommendations.<a name="F6"><a href="#FN6"><sup><fontsize=-2>6</font></sup></a></a>

<p>   The CONTU Final Report recommended that the copyright law be amended, <em>inter 
alia</em>, ``to make it explicit that computer programs, to the extent that they 
embody an author's original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright.'' 
National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works, <em>Final Report</em> 
1 (1979) [hereinafter CONTU Report].  CONTU recommended two changes relevant 
here: that section 117, the status quo provision, be repealed and replaced with 
a section limiting exclusive rights in computer programs so as ``to ensure that 
rightful possessors of copies of computer programs may use or adapt these copies 
for their use,'' <em>id</em>.; and that a definition of computer program be added to 
section 101.  <em>Id</em>. at 12.  Congress adopted both changes.  Act of Dec. 12, 1980, 
Pub. L. No. 96--517, &#167; 10, 94 Stat. 3015, 3028.  The revisions embodied CONTU's 
recommendations to clarify the law of copyright of computer software. 
H.R. Rep. No. 1307, 96th Cong., 2d Sess. 23, <em>reprinted in</em> 1980 U.S. Code Cong. & 
Ad. News 6460, 6482. 
 
   The 1980 amendments added a definition of a computer program:
   
<blockquote> 
   A ``computer program'' is a set of statements or instructions to be used 
directly or indirectly in a computer in order to bring about a certain result. 
</blockquote> 

<p>   17 U.S.C.  &#167; 101. The amendments also substituted a new section 117 which 
provides that ``it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer 
program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation of that 
computer program'' when necessary to ``the utilization of the computer program'' or 
``for archival purposes only.'' 17 U.S.C.  &#167; 117. The parties agree that this 
section is not implicated in the instant lawsuit.  The language of the 
provision, however, by carving out an exception to the normal proscriptions 
against copying, clearly indicates that programs are copyrightable and are 
otherwise afforded copyright protection. 
 
   We considered the issue of copyright protection for a computer program in 
<em>Williams Electronics, Inc</em>. v. <em>Artic International, Inc</em>., and concluded that ``the 
copyrightability of computer programs is firmly established after the 1980 
amendment to the Copyright Act.'' 685 F.2d at 875. At issue in <em>Williams</em> were not 
only two audiovisual copyrights to the ``attract'' and ``play'' modes of a video 
game, but also the computer program which was expressed in object code embodied 
in ROM and which controlled the sights and sounds of the game.  Defendant there 
had argued ``that when the issue is the copyright on a computer program, a 
distinction must be drawn between the `source code' version of a computer 
program, which ...  can be afforded copyright protection, and the ``object code'' 
stage, which ... cannot be so protected,'' an argument we rejected.  <em>Id</em>. at 
876. 
 
   The district court here questioned whether copyright was to be
limited to works ``designed to be ``read'' by a human reader [as
distinguished from] read by an expert with a microscope and
patience'', 545 F. Supp. at 821. The suggestion that copyrightability
depends on a communicative function to individuals stems from the
early decision of <em>White-Smith Music Publishing Co</em>. v.
<em>Apollo Co</em>., 209 U.S. 1, 52 L. Ed. 655, 28 S. Ct. 319 (1908),
which held a piano roll was not a copy of the musical composition
because it was not in a form others, except perhaps for a very expert
few, could perceive.  <em>See</em> 1 <em>Nimmer on Copyright</em>
&#167; 2.03[B][1] (1983).  However, it is clear from the language of the
1976 Act and its legislative history that it was intended to
obliterate distinctions engendered by <em>White-Smith</em>.
H.R. Rep. No. 1476, <em>supra</em>, at 52, <em>reprinted in</em> 1976
U.S. Code Cong. & Ad. News at 5665.
 
   Under the statute, copyright extends to works in any tangible means of 
expression ``<em>from which they can be perceived</em>, reproduced, or otherwise 
communicated, either directly or <em>with the aid of a machine or device</em>.'' 17 
U.S.C.  &#167; 102(a) (emphasis added).  Further, the definition of ``computer 
program'' adopted by Congress in the 1980 amendments is ``sets of statements or 
instructions to be used <em>directly or indirectly</em> in a computer in order to bring 
about a certain result.'' 17 U.S.C.  &#167; 101 (emphasis added).  As source code 
instructions must be translated into object code before the computer can act 
upon them, only instructions expressed in object code can be used ``directly'' by 
the computer.  <em>See Midway Manufacturing Co</em>. v. <em>Strohon</em>, 564 F. Supp. 741, 750 
(N.D.Ill. 1983). This definition was adopted following the CONTU Report in which 
the majority clearly took the position that object codes are proper subjects of 
copyright.  <em>See</em> CONTU Report at 21.  The majority's conclusion was reached 
although confronted by a dissent based upon the theory that the ``machine-control 
phase'' of a program is not directed at a human audience.  <em>See</em> CONTU Report at 
28--30 (dissent of Commissioner Hersey). 
 
   The defendant in <em>Williams</em> had also argued that a copyrightable work ``must be 
intelligible to human beings and must be intended as a medium of communication 
to human beings,'' <em>id</em>. at 876--77.  We reiterate the statement we made in <em>Williams</em> 
when we rejected that argument: ``[t]he answer to defendant's contention is in 
the words of the statute itself.'' 685 F.2d at 877.     
   The district court also expressed uncertainty as to whether a computer 
program in object code could be classified as a ``literary work.''<a name="F7"><a href="#FN7"><sup><fontsize=-2>7</font></sup></a></a> However, the 
category of ``literary works'', one of the seven copyrightable categories, is not 
confined to literature in the nature of Hemingway's <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>. 
The definition of ``literary works'' in section 101 includes expression not only 
in words but also ``numbers, or other . . . numerical symbols or indicia'', 
thereby expanding the common usage of ``literary works.'' <em>Cf. Harcourt, Brace & 
World, Inc</em>. v. <em>Graphic Controls Corp.</em>, 329 F. Supp. 517, 523--24 (S.D.N.Y. 1971) 
(the symbols designating questions or response spaces on exam answer sheets held 
to be copyrightable ``writings'' under 1909 Act); <em>Reiss</em> v. <em>National Quotation 
Bureau, Inc</em>., 276 F. 717 (S.D.N.Y. 1921) (code book of coined words designed for 
cable use copyrightable).  Thus a computer program, whether in object code or 
source code, is a ``literary work'' and is protected from unauthorized copying, 
whether from its object or source code version.  <em>Accord Midway Mfg. Co</em>. v. 
<em>Strohon</em>, slip op. at 25--27; <em>see also GCA Corp</em>. v. <em>Chance</em>, 217 U.S.P.A. at 
719--20.

<p>B. 

<p><em>Copyrightability of a Computer Program</em> 
<em>Embedded on a ROM</em> 
</center>
 
<p>
   Just as the district court's suggestion of a distinction between source code
and object code was rejected by our opinion in <em>Williams</em> issued three days after
the district court opinion, so also was its suggestion that embodiment of a 
computer program on a ROM, as distinguished from in a traditional writing, 
detracts from its copyrightability.  In <em>Williams</em> we rejected the argument that 
``a computer program is not infringed when the program is loaded into electronic
memory devices (ROMs) and used to control the activity of machines.'' 685 F.2d at 
876. Defendant there had argued that there can be no copyright protection for 
the ROMs because they are utilitarian objects or machine parts.  We held that 
the statutory requirement of ``fixation'', the manner in which the issue arises, 
is satisfied through the embodiment of the expression in the ROM
devices.  <em>Id</em>.

<p><em>Copyrightability of Computer Operating</em>
<em>System Programs</em>
</center> 
 
<p>
   We turn to the heart of Franklin's position on appeal which is that
computer operating system programs, as distinguished from application
programs, are not the proper subject of copyright ``regardless of the
language or medium in which they are fixed.'' Brief of Appellee at 15
(emphasis deleted).  Apple suggests that this issue too is foreclosed by
our <em>Williams</em> decision because some portion of the program at
issue there was in effect an operating system program.  Franklin is
correct that this was not an issue raised by the parties in
<em>Williams</em> and it was not considered by the court.  Thus we
consider it as a matter of first impression.
 
   Franklin contends that operating system programs are <em>per se</em> excluded from 
copyright protection under the express terms of section 102(b) of the Copyright 
Act, and under the precedent and underlying principles of <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>, 101 
U.S. 99, 25 L. Ed. 841 (1879). These separate grounds have substantial analytic
overlap. 
 
   In <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>, plaintiff's testator held a copyright on a book 
explaining a bookkeeping system which included blank forms with ruled lines and 
headings designed for use with that system.  Plaintiff sued for copyright 
infringement on the basis of defendant's publication of a book containing a 
different arrangement of the columns and different headings, but which used a 
similar plan so far as results were concerned.  The Court, in reversing the 
decree for the plaintiff, concluded that blank account-books were not the 
subject of copyright and that ``the mere copyright of Selden's book did not 
confer upon him the exclusive right to make and use account-books, ruled and 
arranged as designated by him and described and illustrated in said book.''
 <em>Id</em>. at 107. The Court stated that copyright of the books did not give 
the plaintiff the exclusive right to use the system explained in the books, 
noting, for example, that ``copyright of a work on mathematical science cannot 
give to the author an exclusive right to the methods of operation which he 
propounds.'' <em>Id</em>. at 103. 
 
   Franklin reads <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em> as ``stand[ing] for several fundamental 
principles, each presenting ... insuperable obstacle to the 
copyrightability of Apple's operating systems.'' It states: 

<p><blockquote> 
   <em>First, Baker</em> teaches that use of a system itself does not infringe a 
copyright on the description of the system.  <em>Second, Baker</em> enunciates the rule 
that copyright does not extend to purely utilitarian works.  <em>Finally, Baker</em> 
emphasizes that the copyright laws may not be used to obtain and hold a monopoly 
over an idea.  In so doing, <em>Baker</em> highlights the principal difference between 
the copyright and patent laws---a difference that is highly pertinent in this 
case.
</blockquote> 
 
   Brief of Appellee at 22. 
 
   Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act, the other ground on which Franklin 
relies, appeared first in the 1976 version, long after the decision in <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>. It provides: 

<p><blockquote> 
   In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship 
extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, 
principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, 
explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.
</blockquote> 
 
   It is apparent that section 102(b) codifies a substantial part of the holding 
and dictum of <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>.  <em>See 1 Nimmer on Copyright</em> 
&#167; 2.18[D], at 2--207. 
 
   We turn to consider the two principal points of Franklin's argument.
 
   1.  <em>``Process'', ``System'' or ``Method of Operation''</em>
 
   Franklin argues that an operating system program is either a
``process'', ``system'', or ``method of operation'' and hence
uncopyrightable.<a name="F8"><a href="#FN8"><sup><fontsize=-2>8</font></sup></a></a> Franklin correctly notes that underlying section 102(b) and
many of the statements for which <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em> is
cited is the distinction which must be made between property subject
to the patent law, which protects discoveries, and that subject to
copyright law, which protects the writings describing such
discoveries.  However, Franklin's argument misapplies that distinction
in this case.  Apple does not seek to copyright the method which
instructs the computer to perform its operating functions but only the
instructions themselves.  The method would be protected, if at all, by
the patent law, an issue as yet unresolved.  <em>See Diamond</em> v.
<em>Diehr</em>, 450 U.S. 175, 67 L. Ed. 2d 155, 101 S. Ct.  1048 (1981).
    
 
   Franklin's attack on operating system programs as ``methods'' or ``processes'' 
seems inconsistent with its concession that application programs are an 
appropriate subject of copyright.  Both types of programs instruct the computer 
to do something.  Therefore, it should make no difference for purposes of 
section 102(b) whether these instructions tell the computer to help prepare an 
income tax return (the task of an application program) or to translate a high 
level language program from source code into its binary language object code 
form (the task of an operating system program such as ``Applesoft'', <em>see</em> 
note 4 <em>supra</em>).  Since it is only the instructions which are protected, 
a``process'' is no more involved because the instructions in an operating system
program may be used to activate the operation of the computer than it would be
if instructions were written in ordinary English in a manual which described 
the necessary steps to activate an intricate complicated machine.  There is, therefore, no reason to 
afford any less copyright protection to the instructions in an operating system 
program than to the instructions in an application program. 
 
   Franklin's argument, receptively treated by the district court, that an 
operating system program is part of a machine mistakenly focuses on the physical 
characteristics of the instructions.  But the medium is not the message.  We 
have already considered and rejected aspects of this contention in the 
discussion of object code and ROM.  The mere fact that the operating system 
program may be etched on a ROM does not make the program either a machine, part 
of a machine or its equivalent.  Furthermore, as one of Franklin's witnesses 
testified, an operating system does not have to be permanently in the machine in 
ROM, but it may be on some other medium, such as a diskette or magnetic tape, 
where it could be readily transferred into the temporary memory space of the 
computer.  In fact, some of the operating systems as issue were on diskette.  As 
the CONTU majority stated, 
 
<blockquote>
   Programs should no more be considered machine parts than videotapes should be 
considered parts of projectors or phonorecords parts of sound reproduction 
equipment. . . .   That the words of a program are used ultimately in the 
implementation of a process should in no way affect their copyrightability. 
</blockquote>
 
   CONTU Report at 21. 
 
   Franklin also argues that the operating systems cannot be copyrighted because 
they are ``purely utilitarian works'' and that Apple is seeking to block the use 
of the art embodied in its operating systems.  This argument stems from the 
following dictum in <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>: 
 
<blockquote>
   The very object of publishing a book on science or the useful arts is to 
communicate to the world the useful knowledge which it contains.  But this 
object would be frustrated if the knowledge could not be used without incurring 
the guilt of piracy of the book.  And where the art it teaches cannot be used 
without employing the methods and diagrams used to illustrate the book, or such 
as are similar to them, such methods and diagrams are to be considered as 
necessary incidents to the art, and given therewith to the public; not given for 
the purpose of publication in other works explanatory of the art, but for the 
purpose of practical application. 
</blockquote>
 
   101 U.S. at 103. We cannot accept the expansive reading given to this 
language by some courts, see, <em>e.g., Taylor Instrument Companies</em> v. 
<em>Fawley-Brost Co</em>., 139 F.2d 98 (7th Cir. 1943), <em>cert. denied</em>, 321 U.S. 785, 88 L. Ed. 1076, 64 
S. Ct. 782 (1944). In this respect we agree with the views expressed by 
Professor Nimmer in his treatise.  <em>See</em> 1 <em>Nimmer on Copyright</em> &#167; 2.18[C]. 
   
 
   Although a literal construction of this language could support Franklin's 
reading that precludes copyrightability if the copyright work is put to a 
utilitarian use, that interpretation has been rejected by a later Supreme Court 
decision.  In <em>Mazer</em> v. <em>Stein</em>, 347 U.S. 201, 218, 98 L. Ed. 630, 74 S. Ct. 460 
(1954), the Court stated: ``We find nothing in the copyright statute to support 
the argument that the intended use or use in industry of an article eligible for 
copyright bars or invalidates its registration.  We do not read such a 
limitation into the copyright law.'' <em>Id</em>. at 218. The CONTU majority also rejected 
the expansive view some courts have given <em>Baker</em> v. <em>Selden</em>, and stated, ``That the 
words of a program are used ultimately in the implementation of a process should 
in no way affect their copyrightability.'' <em>Id</em>. at 21.  It referred to ``copyright 
practice past and present, which recognizes copyright protection for a work of 
authorship regardless of the uses to which it may be put.'' <em>Id</em>.  The Commission 
continued: ``The copyright status of the written rules for a game <em>or a system for 
the operation of a machine</em> is unaffected by the fact that those rules direct the 
actions of those who play the game or <em>carry out the process</em>.'' <em>Id</em>.  (emphasis 
added).  As we previously noted, we can consider the CONTU Report as accepted by 
Congress since Congress wrote into the law the majority's recommendations almost 
verbatim.  <em>See</em> 18 Cong.Rec. H10767 (daily ed. Nov. 17, 1980) (Rep. Kastenmeier: 
Bill ``eliminates confusion about the legal status of computer software by 
enacting the recommendations of [CONTU] clarifying the law of copyright of 
computer software''); 18 Cong.Rec. S14766 (daily ed. Nov. 20, 1980) (Sen. Bayh: 
``[t]his language reflects that proposed by [CONTU'']). 
 
   Perhaps the most convincing item leading us to reject Franklin's
argument is that the statutory definition of a computer program is a
set of instructions to be used in a computer in order to bring about a
certain result, 17 U.S.C. &#167; 101, makes no distinction between
application programs and operating programs.  Franklin can point to no
decision which adopts the distinction it seeks to make.  In the one
other reported case to have considered it, <em>Apple Computer,
Inc</em>. v. <em>Formula International, Inc</em>., 562 F. Supp. 775
(C.D.Cal. 1983), the court reached the same conclusion which we do,
<em>i.e.</em> that an operating system program is not per se precluded
from copyright.  It stated, ``There is nothing in any of the statutory
terms which suggest a different result for different types of computer
programs based upon the function they serve within the machine.''
<em>Id</em>. at 780.  Other courts have also upheld the
copyrightability of operating programs without discussion of this
issue.  <em>See Tandy Corp</em>. v. <em>Personal Micro Computers,
Inc</em>., 524 F. Supp. at 173 (input-output routine stored in ROM which
translated input into machine language in a similar fashion as
Applesoft and Apple Integer Basic proper subject of copyright);
<em>GCA Corp</em>. v. <em>Chance</em>, 217 U.S.P.Q. at 719--20 (object
code version of registered source code version of operating programs
is the same work and protected).
 
   2.  <em>Idea/Expression Dichotomy</em>
 
   Franklin's other challenge to copyright of operating system programs relies 
on the line which is drawn between ideas and their expression.  <em>Baker</em> 
v. <em>Selden</em> 
remains a benchmark in the law of copyright for the reading given it in 
<em>Mazer</em> v. <em>Stein, supra</em>, where the Court stated, ``Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no 
exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression 
of the idea---not the idea itself.'' 347 U.S. at 217 (footnote omitted). 
 
   The expression/idea dichotomy is now expressly recognized in
section 102(b) which precludes copyright for ``any idea.'' This
provision was not intended to enlarge or contract the scope of
  copyright protection but ``to restate ... the basic dichotomy
between expression and idea remains unchanges.'' H.R. Rep. No. 1476,
<em>supra</em>, at 57, <em>reprinted in</em> 1976 U.S. Code Cong. &
Ad. News at 5670.  The legislative history indicates that section
102(b) was intended ``to make clear that the expression adopted by the
programmer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and
that the actual processes or methods embodied in the program are not
within the scope of the copyright law.'' <em>Id</em>.
 
   Many of the courts which have sought to draw the line between an idea and 
expression have found difficulty in articulating where it falls.  <em>See, e.g., 
Nichols</em> v. <em>Universal Pictures Corp</em>. 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir. 1930) (L. Hand, 
J.); <em>see</em> discussion in 3 <em>Nimmer on Copyright</em> &#167; 13.03[A].  We believe that in the 
context before us, a program for an operating system, the line must be a 
pragmatic one, which also keeps in consideration ``the preservation of the 
balance between competition and protection reflected in the patent and copyright 
laws''.  <em>Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp</em>. v. <em>Kalpakian</em>, 446 F.2d 738, 742 (9th 
Cir. 1971). As we stated in <em>Franklin Mint Corp</em>. v. <em>National Wildlife Art 
Exchange, Inc</em>., 575 F.2d 62, 64 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 439 U.S. 880, 58 L. Ed. 
2d 193, 99 S. Ct. 217 (1978), ``Unlike a patent, a copyright protects originality 
rather than novelty or invention.'' In that opinion, we quoted approvingly the 
following passage from <em>Dymow</em> v. <em>Bolton</em>, 11 F.2d 690, 691 (2d Cir. 1926): 
 
<blockquote>
   Just as a patent affords protection only to the means of reducing an 
inventive idea to practice, so the copyright law protects the means of 
expressing an idea; and it is as near the whole truth as generalization can 
usually reach that, <em>if the same idea can be expressed in a plurality of totally 
different manners, a plurality of copyrights may result</em>, and no infringement 
will exist.
</blockquote> 
 
   (emphasis added). 
 
   We adopt the suggestion in the above language and thus focus on whether the 
idea is capable of various modes of expression.  If other programs can be 
written or created which perform the same function as an Apple's operating 
system program, then that program is an expression of the idea and hence 
copyrightable.  In essence, this inquiry is no different than that made to 
determine whether the expression and idea have merged, which has been stated to 
occur where there are no or few other ways of expressing a particular idea. 
<em>See, e.g., Morrissey</em> v. <em>Procter & Gamble Co</em>., 379 F.2d 675, 678--79 (1st Cir. 
1967); <em>Freedman</em> v. <em>Grolier Enterprises, Inc</em>., 179 U.S.P.Q. 476, 478 (S.D.N.Y. 
1973) (``[c]opyright protection will not be given to a form of expression 
necessarily dictated by the underlying subject matter''); CONTU Report at 20. 
 
   The district court made no findings as to whether some or all of Apple's 
operating programs represent the only means of expression of the idea underlying 
them.  Although there seems to be a concession by Franklin that at least some of 
the programs can be rewritten, we do not believe that the record on that issue 
is so clear that it can be decided at the appellate level.  Therefore, if the 
issue is pressed on remand, the necessary finding can be made at that time. 
 
   Franklin claims that whether or not the programs can be rewritten, there are 
a limited ``number of ways to arrange operating systems to enable a computer to 
run the vast body of Apple-compatible software'', Brief of Appellee at 20.  This 
claim has no pertinence to either the idea/expression dichotomy or merger.  The 
idea which may merge with the expression, thus making the copyright unavailable, 
is the idea which is the subject of the expression.  The idea of one of the 
operating system programs is, for example, how to translate source code into 
object code.  If other methods of expressing that idea are not foreclosed as a 
practical matter, then there is no merger.  Franklin may wish to achieve total 
compatibility with independently developed application programs written for the 
Apple II, but that is a commercial and competitive objective which does not 
enter into the somewhat metaphysical issue of whether particular ideas and 
expressions have merged. 
 
   In summary, Franklin's contentions that operating system programs are <em>per se</em> 
not copyrightable is unpersuasive.  The other courts before whom this issue has 
been raised have rejected the distinction.  Neither the CONTU majority nor 
Congress made a distinction between operating and application programs.  We 
believe that the 1980 amendments reflect Congress' receptivity to 
new technology and its desire to encourage, through the copyright laws, 
continued imagination and creativity in computer programming.  Since we believe 
that the district court's decision on the preliminary injunction was, to a large 
part, influenced by an erroneous view of the availability of copyright for 
operating system programs and unnecessary concerns about object code and ROMs, 
we must reverse the denial of the preliminary injunction and remand for 
reconsideration.

D.

<p><em>Irreparable Harm</em>
</center> 
 
<p>
   The district court, without any extended discussion, found that Apple had not 
made the requisite showing of irreparable harm, stating ``Apple is better suited 
to withstand whatever injury it might sustain during litigation than is Franklin 
to withstand the effects of a preliminary injunction.'' 545 F. Supp. at 812, 825. 
In so ruling, the district court failed to consider the prevailing view that a 
showing of a prima facie case of copyright infringement or reasonable likelihood 
of success on the merits raises a presumption of irreparable harm.  <em>See, e.g., 
Atari, Inc</em>. v. <em>North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp</em>., 672 F.2d 607, 
620 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied</em>, 459 U.S. 880, 103 S. Ct. 176, 74 L. Ed. 2d 145 
(1982); <em>Wainwright Securities Inc</em>. v. <em>Wall Street Transcript Corp</em>., 558 F.2d 91, 
94 (2d Cir. 1977), <em>cert. denied</em>, 434 U.S. 1014, 54 L. Ed. 2d 759, 98 S. Ct. 730 
(1978); <em>Klitzner Industries, Inc</em>. v. <em>H.K. James Co</em>., 535 F. Supp. 1249, 1259 
(E.D.Pa. 1982); <em>Custom Decor, Inc</em>. v. <em>Nautical Crafts, Inc</em>., 502 F. Supp. 154, 
157 (E.D.Pa. 1980). A copyright plaintiff who makes out a prima facie case of 
infringement is entitled to a preliminary injunction without a detailed showing 
of irreparable harm.  <em>See</em> 3 <em>Nimmer on Copyright</em> &#167; 14.06[A], at 14--50 & n.16 (collecting authorities). 
 
   The CONTU Final Report recognized that ``[t]he cost of developing computer 
programs is far greater than the cost of their duplication.'' CONTU Report at 11. 
Apple introduced substantial evidence of the considerable time and money it had 
invested in the development of the computer programs in suit.  Thus even without 
the presumption of irreparable harm generally applied in copyright infringement 
cases, the jeopardy to Apple's investment and competitive position caused by 
Franklin's wholesale copying of many of its key operating programs would satisfy 
the requirement of irreparable harm needed to support a preliminary injunction.
<em>See Atari, Inc</em>. v. <em>North American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp</em>., 672 F.2d 
at 620; <em>Custom Decor, Inc</em>. v. <em>Nautical Crafts Inc</em>., 502 F. Supp. 154, 157 
(E.D.Tenn. 1980); <em>Herbert Rosenthal Jewelry Corp</em>. v. <em>Zale Corp</em>., 323 F. Supp. 
1234, 1238 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). 
 
   In <em>Kontes Glass Co</em>. v. <em>Lab Glass, inc</em>., 373 F.2d 319, 320--21 (3d Cir. 1967), 
this court appeared to adopt an inverse relationship approach to the irreparable 
harm issue, suggesting that the strength of the required showing of irreparable 
injury varies inversely with the strength of plaintiff's showing of a likelihood 
of success on the merits.  <em>See Midway Mfg. Co</em>. v. <em>Bandai-America, Inc</em>., 546 F. 
Supp. 125, 141--142 (D.N.J. 1982). In <em>Kontes</em>, we were not presented with a case 
in which copyrighted material central to the essence of plaintiff's operations 
was concededly copied, as we are here.  We believe the <em>Kontes</em> approach is best 
suited to those cases where the injury from copying can be fairly considered 
minimal, limited or conjectural.  In those circumstances it provides flexibility 
in applying the equitable remedy of preliminary injunctions through evaluation 
of the irreparable harm factor.  Normally, however, the public interest 
underlying the copyright law requires a presumption of irreparable harm, as long 
as there is, as here, adequate evidence of the expenditure of significant time, 
effort and money directed to the production of the copyrighted material. 
Otherwise, the rationale for protecting copyright, that of encouraging 
creativity, would be undermined.  As Judge Broderick stated in <em>Klitzner 
Industries, Inc</em>. v. <em>H.K. James & Co</em>., 535 F. Supp. at 1259--60:      

<p><blockquote> 
   Since Congress has elected to grant certain exclusive rights to the owner of 
a copyright in a protected work, it is virtually axiomatic that the public 
interest can only be served by upholding copyright protections and, 
correspondingly, preventing the misappropriation of the skills, creative 
energies, and resources which are invested in the protected work. 
</blockquote>
 
   Nor can we accept the district court's explanation which stressed
the ``devastating effect'' of a preliminary injunction on Franklin's
business.  If that were the correct standard, then a knowing infringer
would be permitted to construct its business around its infringement,
a result we cannot condone.  <em>See Atari, Inc</em>. v. <em>North
American Philips Consumer Electronics Corp</em>., 672 F.2d at 620;
<em>cf. Helene Curtis Industries, Inc</em>. v. <em>Church & Dwight
Co</em>., 560 F.2d 1325, 1333 (7th Cir. 1977) (trademark infringement),
<em>cert. denied</em>, 434 U.S. 1070, 55 L. Ed. 2d 772, 98 S. Ct. 1252
(1978). The size of the infringer should not be determinative of the
copyright holder's ability to get prompt judicial redress.

<p><em>Additional Issues</em>
</center> 
 
<p>
   Franklin has raised a number of issues concerning Apple's compliance with 
various statutory formalities such as registration, notice and deposit.  It has 
challenged, in a pending motion to dismiss, the copyrights of the eleven works 
in suit which were deposited in object code format, and which were registered 
under the Copyright Office's ``rule of doubt.''<a name="F9"><a href="#FN9"><sup><fontsize=-2>9</font></sup></a></a> Franklin challenges three 
programs, i.e. Apple Integer Basic, Autostart ROM and DOS 3.3, on the ground 
that they or their predecessors were published without the requisite notice.  We 
do not reach these issue on appeal nor do we consider Franklin's claim that 
Apple's misuse of its copyrights bars their enforcement.  The district court did 
not consider these claims in denying the motion for preliminary injunction. 
There are no factual findings with regard to them.  On remand, they can be 
considered by the district court in the first instance who can also decide the 
extent to which they are relevant, if at all, to a preliminary injunction. 
 
   

<p><center> 
V.
</center> 

 <p>
   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we will reverse the
denial of the preliminary injunction and remand to the district court
for further proceedings in accordance herewith.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN3"></a><a href="#F3">3</a></b>  In contrast to the permanent memory devices a RAM (Random Access Memory) 
is a chip on which volatile internal memory is stored which is erased when the 
computer's power is turned off.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN4"></a><a href="#F4">4</a></b>  The fourteen programs at issue, briefly described, are: 
<blockquote> 
   (1) <em>Autostart ROM</em> is sold as part of the Apple Computer and is embedded on a 
ROM chip.  The program has also been published in source code as part of a 
copyrighted book, the Apple II manual.  When the computer's power is turned on, 
Autostart ROM performs internal routines that turn on the circuits in the 
computer and make its physical parts (e.g. input/output devices, screen, and 
memory) ready for use. 
 
   (2) <em>Applesoft</em> is Apple's version of the Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic 
Instruction Code (BASIC) language.  The program is stored in ROM and is sold as 
part of the computer.  Applesoft translates instructions written in the 
higher-level BASIC language into the lower-level machine code that the computer 
understands. 
 
   (3) <em>Floating-Point BASIC</em> is the same program as Applesoft but is stored on 
disks rather than on ROMs.  It is used in earlier versions of the Apple II 
computer that did not have the Applesoft program in ROM. 
 
   (4) <em>Apple Integer BASIC</em>, another translator program, is stored on the DOS 3.3 
Master Disk.  This program used Apple's first version of BASIC for the Apple II 
computer.  It implements a simpler version of the Applesoft program. 
 
   (5) <em>DOS 3.3</em>, the disk operating system program, provides the instructions 
necessary to control the operation between the disk system (disk drive) and the 
computer itself.  It controls the reading and writing functions of the disks and 
includes other routines which put all the data transfers in sequence.  The DOS 
3.3 Master Disk is sold separately from the computer, and includes several of 
the other operating programs referred to in this note. 
 
   (6) <em>Master Create</em> is stored on a disk.  When a disk is prepared for use the 
DOS 3.3 program is placed on that disk in a form that is dependent on the amount 
of Random Access Memory (RAM) available.  The Master Create program replaces the 
DOS 3.3 on the disk with a version that is independent of the amount of RAM 
available. 
 
   (7) <em>Copy</em>, which is stored on a disk, enables the user to copy programs 
written in Apple Integer BASIC from one disk to another. 
 
   (8) <em>Copy A</em>, also stored on a disk, enables the user to copy programs written 
in Applesoft from one disk to another. 
 
   (9) <em>Copy OBJO</em> contains a file of subroutines used by the Copy and Copy A 
programs. 
 
   (10) <em>Chain</em>, another disk stored program, allows data to be passed between 
different parts of a program when only one part of the program is in RAM at a 
given time.  Thus, Chain preserves data already stored in RAM while another part 
of the program is being loaded into RAM. 
 
   (11) <em>Hello</em>, also disk stored, is the first program executed after the power 
is turned on and a disk is ready for use.  It determines how much RAM is in the 
computer and which version of BASIC needs to be loaded into the computer. 
 
   (12) <em>Boot 13</em> is stored on disk and sold on a Master Disk.  It allows the user 
having a disk controller card that contains the Apple 16-Sector Boot ROM to use 
older versions of the Apple disk operating system. 
 
   (13) <em>Apple 13-Sector Boot ROM</em> is stored in a ROM located on the disk 
controller card plugged into the Mother Board.  By turning on numerous circuits 
on the card and in the Apple II computer, this program causes other parts of the 
disk operating system used for 13-Sector format disks to load. 
 
   (14) <em>Apple 16-Sector Boot ROM</em>, stored in a ROM located on the disk controller 
card, turns on numerous circuits on the card and in the Apple II computer and 
causes other parts of the disk operating system used for 16-Sector format disks 
to load.  It therefore enables the user to start or permit the running of 
another program or to prepare the computer to receive a program.

<p>   The above descriptions represent an effort to translate the language used by 
computer experts into language reasonably intelligible to lay persons.  They 
differ in some respects from the descriptions in the district court's opinion, 
545 F. Supp. at 815-16, which were taken from the complaint.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN5"></a><a href="#F5">5</a></b>  For example, 8 bytes of memory were altered
in the Autostart ROM program so that when the computer is turned on
``ACE 100'' appears on the screen rather than ``Apple II.'' The
Franklin DOS 3.3. program also had 16 bytes (out of 9000) that allowed
use of upper and lower case.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN6"></a><a href="#F6">6</a></b>  Section 117
applied only to the scope of protection to be accorded copyrighted
works when used in conjunction with a computer and not to the
copyrightability of programs.  H.R. Rep. No. 1476, at 116,
<em>reprinted in</em> 1976 U.S.  Code Cong. & Ad. News at 5731.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN7"></a><a href="#F7">7</a></b>  The district court stated that a programmer working directly in object 
code appears to think more as a mathematician or engineer, that the process of 
constructing a chip is less a work of authorship than the product of engineering 
knowledge, and that it may be more apt to describe an encoded ROM as a pictorial 
three-dimensional object than as a literary work.  545 F. Supp. at 821--22. The 
district court's remarks relied in part on a quotation about ``microcode'', see 
id. at 821 n.14; Apple introduced testimony that none of the works in suit 
contain ``microcode.'' Moreover, Apple does not seek to protect the ROM's 
architecture but only the program encoded upon it.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN8"></a><a href="#F8">8</a></b>  We are unpersuaded by
Franklin's initial contention that Apple is bound to this position
because some of Apple's witnesses in the preliminary injunction
hearing used these terms in describing the works in suit.  As the
CONTU Report itself recognized, the distinction between copyrightable
computer programs and uncopyrightable processes or methods of
operation does not always seem to ``shimmer with clarity.'' CONTU
Report at 18.  The witnesses undoubtedly had the not uncommon
difficulty of finding the precisely correct words of description in
this field.  It would be both unreasonable and arbitrary to consider
the statements of non-lawyer witnesses without experience in using
statutory language as words of art to be binding admissions against
Apple.

<hr><p><b><a name="FN9"></a><a href="#F9">9</a></b> Apparently the Register
of Copyrights utilizes its rule of doubt when the deposit of a
computer program is made in object code form because its examiners
cannot interpret such code to determine if there has been
copyrightable authorship.
