To shed light on appropriate grouping practices for early adolescents, this article
presents current data on using between-class grouping and regrouping in American
schools serving this population, based on the 1988 Johns Hopkins University middle
school survey. Findings show that learning opportunities in the middle grades remain
highly stratified. <P>

Analysis of essays comparing experiences in gifted and regular classes written by sixth
grade gifted students found that many students felt teachers and peers outside the
gifted class had unfair expectations of them. Other topics addressed by students
included grading, group work, lack of acknowledgement for effort, treatment by peers,
and teacher expectations. <P>

This study investigated attitudes of educators from both the middle school movement
and gifted education, by means of a survey of 400 members of relevant professional
organizations. The survey focused on six interest clusters: (1) grouping strategies, (2)
identification issues, (3) curriculum modifications, (4) teacher preparation, (5) program
evaluation, and (6) the emotional/social needs of gifted students. Opposing attitudes
were found for two clusters: first, grouping practices (with educators of the gifted
favoring ability grouping and middle school educators opposing such grouping) and
second, social development (with only middle school educators seeing the "gifted" label
as creating social adjustment problems). On the remaining clusters the groups had the
same opinions but differed in how strongly they felt. Educators of gifted students felt
more strongly that the regular curriculum was not challenging enough for gifted
students, that the programs for gifted students should address the emotional needs of
the students, and that middle school teachers need more staff development in the
characteristics and needs of gifted students. Educators of the gifted ranked their top
three priorities as curriculum, teacher preparation, and appropriate identification while
middle school educators selected curriculum, grouping practices, and teacher
preparation as most important. The survey form and 24 references are attached.<P>

Thirty sixth graders in accelerated mathematics classes were taught in cooperative
learning teams for 12 weeks.  Students appeared to benefit academically, personally,
and socially from the cooperative learning strategies used to teach mathematics,
cooperative learning skills, effective communications, internal locus of control, and
personal responsibility in decision-making.<P>

In spring 1988, the Johns Hopkins Center for Research on Elementary and Middle
Schools (CREMS) conducted a national survey of principals in 2,400 public middle
grade schools that include grade 7. Using the 1988 survey date, this document
presents an overview of educational approaches and practices in schools that serve
early adolescents. Topics examined include: (1) grade span; (2) size; (3) grouping; (4)
number of teachers per students; (5) changing classmates; (6) homeroom and advisory
periods; (7) guidance counselors; (8) teams of teachers; (9) curriculum; (10) instruction;
(11) goals for students; (12) transitions and articulation practices; (13) remediation; (14)
report card entries; (15) teacher certification; and (16) teacher talents. This
document also summarizes principals' reports of their overall evaluation of present
practices and presents four conclusions regarding middle grades reform based on
survey data. The survey is appended. <P>

This paper examines gifted education in the context of current educational reform
efforts. It offers a rationale for the differentiated education of gifted students based on
American values and equitable allocation of educational resources. Examples are
offered of curriculum content modification for math, science, language arts, and social
studies which utilize four approaches: (1) acceleration, (2) enrichment, (3)
sophistication, and (4) novelty. The relationship of gifted education to the America 2000
program and to the six national education goals is noted. The paper then reviews major
reform efforts in the areas of accountability, the middle school concept, and cooperative
learning. Issues remaining to be solved are also identified and include personnel
preparation, unidentified students (e.g., the culturally different), curricular options,
strategies and metathinking, and the value of the term, "gifted," itself. <P>

The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), a longitudinal study
sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics, provides trend data about
transitions experienced as young people develop, attend school, and embark on
careers. The study began with a national sample of about 26,000 eighth graders in
1988
and follows these students at 2-year intervals through high school and further. Findings
of the base year are summarized, drawn from the descriptive summary "A Profile of the
American Eighth Grader" by A. Hafner and others (1990). Characteristics of sample
members, in-school and out-of-school experiences, and aspirations and choice
behaviors are described. The paper is divided into three sections: (1) background on
the
study; (2) cross-sectional findings from the NELS:88 base year, with 24 tables and 16
graphs; and (3) issues for the next wave of data. Appendix 1 describes generating the
sample; Appendix 2 gives a chart of key questionnaire items. <P>

Staffing patterns can significantly affect educators' efforts to provide high-quality
instruction and create positive teacher/student relations in the middle grades. State
data and Johns Hopkins University survey results are used to show how staffing
patterns serving one goal may interfere with accomplishing another goal. Corrective
staffing measures are suggested. <P>

Many middle schools' creative approaches to programing and instruction (through

creative problem solving, and hands-on experience) and responsiveness to young
adolescents' developmental needs embody the best features of effective gifted
programs.<P>

Schatz, E. (Feb 1990).  Ability Grouping for Gifted Learners as It Relates to School
Reform and Restructuring.  Madison:  Wisconsin State Dept. of Education.</b></i><br>
This monograph uses a question-answer format to address issues concerned with
meeting the needs of gifted students as Wisconsin schools restructure and change
grouping practices as part of raising standards of learning for all students. Among 12
questions considered are the following: (1) Aren't some of the principles of middle level
education, cooperative learning and whole class instruction in reading harmful from the
standpoint of providing appropriate programs to gifted students? (2) Isn't acceleration a
necessary component of gifted education but contradictory to the middle level
philosophy? (3) If one views middle level education as anti-tracking and anti-ability
grouping, then how is grouping at the middle of the pyramid ever acceptable? (4)
"Doesn't participation in Midwest Talent Search promote labeling and an "earlier
is better" approach to gifted education? (5) Don't research reports and declining test
scores clearly support as little ability grouping as possible at all levels of education? (6)
Won't cooperative learning increase boredom in gifted students and hold them back?
(7) How can young gifted readers be challenged by whole class instruction in reading?
and (8) How can we be sure school districts are asking the right questions about gifted
education as these strategies are implemented? <P>

The emphasis of middle school philosophy on heterogeneous grouping is examined in
relationship to the needs of gifted learners. Arguments supporting such grouping based
on developmental needs of young adolescents, social discrimination, and the need for
positive role models are considered. Cooperative learning is seen to be an unproven
instructional method with this population.<P>

</b></i><br>
This chapter reviews recent trends toward increasing emphasis on excellence in
American business and applies these trends to school reform and restructuring in the
context of gifted education. First, it notes the main ideas of recent business and
education excellence studies which call for radical changes in the American education
system. Examined is the dilemma of balancing the educational demands of equity and
excellence especially in an age of major demographic shifts. A quality-oriented
paradigm is proposed which merges equity and excellence and focuses on the
individual thus replacing the industrial model paradigm which focused on the "system".
The issue of ability grouping is considered and research supporting within class
grouping is cited. Concepts underlying the middle school approach are noted as
another example where the equity/excellence dilemma and grouping concerns emerge.
"Equifinality" is offered as a concept which suggests many potential ways to reach
resolution especially when the focus is always on the individual gifted learner and the
teacher/facilitator. <P>

Comparison of the fields of gifted education and middle school education indicates
some major differences in such areas as organizing for instruction, how students learn,
mainstreaming, delivery of instruction, affective needs, and the concept of giftedness.

A variety of beliefs and practices central to middle schools may cause special difficulties
for gifted learners.  Such practices often focus on potentially competing goals of student
competencies versus student excellence and include such practices as heterogeneous
grouping, cooperative learning, and an absence of clearly defined middle school
curricula.<P>

This study investigated differences among intellectually gifted students of junior high
age participating in full time intensive programs for the gifted.  Findings indicated some
differences based on ethnicity and gender, but most differences were observed
between lower and higher socioeconomic groups, particularly for social support and
social and behavioral self concept.<P>
