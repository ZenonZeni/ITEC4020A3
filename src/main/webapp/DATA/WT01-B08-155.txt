<A NAME="flood"></A><CENTER><H2>Whitney survives flood, but
Zoo Poo heads downstream</H2></CENTER>
<P>Thanks to the hard work of county crews, trucks carrying <B>Whitney Farms </B>products were rolling just days after floodwaters tore up the road to the <B>Garden Grow Company</B>.
<P>In one day crews dumped 200 truckloads of gravel to fill 12 major washouts and several minor ones.
Polk County's prompt response will minimize disruption of production and distribution.
Company production workers will work double shifts seven days a week to make up for the week of lost time and $500,000 in lost inventory.</P><A HREF="fludfarm.jpg"><IMG SRC="FLUDFARM.gif" IMG WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=100>  High Water:</A> <BR>
The Willamette encroached,  but did not flood <BR>out the buildings.<BR>
<P>The water came within six inches of the company warehouse, sparing the fertilizers and indoor sods.  The main office also escaped damage.
<P>However, 700 pallets of bagged outdoor soil products and a pile of zoo animal manure were lost to the high water.
In response, <B>Garden Grow</B> will ask our suppliers at Washington Park Zoo to increase their output so that the project can continue.  The product, a compost that has yet to be <A HREF="poo.htm">named</A>, is on hold for a year.
The Willamette River normally flows peaceably along a high bank bordering the 67-acre property, which is located near the farming community of Independence Oregon.
On Thursday Feb. 8 the river crested at 36 feet, covering the access road with four feet of water and swamping the composting yard.</P>
<P>Employees had evacuated the premises when the water level reached 24 feet. The call to evacuate, according to company president and founder John  Graham  came when the rising waters lifted and started to push a fully loaded semi truck.</P>
<P>Employees were not able to return to work until Tuesday Feb. 13, and then it was on foot.  By the next day the road was back in service.  Graham noted that insurance will cover the losses.  "Normally we brag about our beautiful river front property.  This week we're bragging about our flood insurance," said Graham.</P>

<A NAME="plant"><H2>Planting Trees
&amp Shrubs</H2>
<P>In recent years, many problems associated with trees in urban and suburban areas have been traced to poor planting techniques.  Essentially, planting trees in the old-fashioned hole in dense compacted soils like those often found around new construction sites and filling the holes with amendments such as peat moss or compost can cause the roots to grow in tangled circles in the rich soil.  Any outward growth stops when the roots reach the denser original soil.</P>
<P>It is important to select either the right tree for the location, or if your heart is set on a particular tree, to ensure that it is planted in a suit-able spot.</P>
<P>Once the proper site is found, loosen the soil by digging or tilling to a depth of 12 inches over an area as much as five times the diameter of the root ball.  Ideally the planting area should be about 30 sq. ft. in size, with the minimum area no smaller than 4'X4'.</P>
<P>Quality organic amendments, like <A HREF="garden.htm">Whitney Farms Planting Mix</A>, can be added to the soil at this time.  Use it uniformly throughout the area and mix it thoroughly into the soil.  If required, blend fertilizers and lime into the planting area at the same time.  Use our <A HREF="allpurp.htm">All Purpose Plant Food</A> for planting trees and shrubs.  For planting roses, we recommend our <A HREF="rose.htm">Rose & Flower Food.</A></P>
<P>Some debate surrounds the use of organic matter when planting new trees.  A number of studies have shown that the closer the soil in the planting area is to the native soil, the more success and better long-term health of the tree.  There are exceptions to the rule, however.  To decide if you need to use compost consider the following factors:</P>
<P>1)  Assess the size of the tree when mature.  Contrary to popular belief, a tree's roots are not a neat mirror image of its shoots.  Root systems can extend three and four times the diameter of the drip line.  Obviously, for large specimen trees like oaks or standard fruit trees, it would be all but impossible to amend the entire root system of the tree. By comparison many smaller trees and shrubs, including roses and fruit trees on dwarfing root stocks, have extremely compact root systems at maturity that are confined to a small area.  With these plants it is quite practical and affordable to thoroughly amend the planting area.  The plants will grow better as a result.</P>
<P>2)	Assess the condition of the native soil.  Adding compost or organic matter to the planting area can contribute significantly to the success of the planting if the soil has poor structure, drains poorly, or is excessively sandy or heavy.  A simple rule of thumb is, the heavier the soil the less amendment should be used.  If you are blessed with rich fertile soil it is likely that few or no amendments would be required for planting trees.  Once the area has been tilled, dig a shallow hole no deeper than the root ball in the center.  To prevent the tree from settling, do not loosen the soil beneath the root ball.  However, if desired, the bottom of the planting area around the root ball could be loosened where practical.  The tree can be set in the hole with the upper surface of the root halt or the old soil mark on the trunk at the same level as the existing soil.  At this point, if you are planting a balled and burlapped plant, you should carefully cut and remove the rope or wires holding the burlap in place.  Some nurserymen recommend that th burlap be removed as well, though care should be taken handling the rootball or it could be damaged.  Roots circling the root ball should be spread out or even cut as needed.  If you are planting bare root plants, gently spread the roots out in the hole.  Cut off any damaged roots.</P>
<P>Fill in around the root ball with the soil from the hole, and Gently pack it down to prevent air pockets.  DO NOT compact the soil around the root ball with your feet.  A good watering will help to settle the soil and ensure contact between the earth and the roots.</P>
<P>Rake the soil around the area, and cover it with two to four inches of mulch like leaf mold, compost, or <A HREF="garden.htm">Whitney Farms Garden Mulch.</A>  Be careful to keep the mulch away from direct contact with the trunk.  In some areas with low rainfall, gardeners are often encouraged to form a berm around the plant to conserve water.  It may, however, also cause the roots to concentrate in the area within the berm close to the tree, as well as contributing to problems with crown rot in areas of high rainfall.  A good mulch provides the same water saving benefit without contributing any problems.</P>

<A NAME="check"><H2>Check before you dig!</H2>
<I>Or how to be sure you get the most out of your dirt...</I>
All the hard work you have put into building your soil can disappear in one misguided morning of overzealous digging or tilling.  Working a soil that is too wet or too dry can destroy the structure of the soil.  Clay sods in particular are easily damaged by digging when they are too wet or dry.  Take a moment to check your soil by following these simple steps.</P>

<P><I>1.  Pick up a handful of your soil and squeeze it gently in your palm to form a
firm ball.
<P>2.	If the soil balls up easily without oozing through your fingers or disappearing into the palm of your hand as gooey mess, it, may be ready to work.  The final check is to see if the ball crumbles, easily.  If you can make a firm ball of soil that still crumbles readily, your soil is just right for digging or tilling.</P>
<P>3.  If the soil is too dry, you will not be able to form a ball.  In this case, give your garden a thorough soaking, let it drain for a day or two, and repeat the above test.</P>
<P>4.  Some soils , like sandy soils are more forgiving and can be worked more easily than clay soils.  For more information on how to determine the kind of soil you have, keep your eye on future editions of The Dirt, or browse the <A HREF="soil.htm">Soil Ammendments</A> section of our web site.</I>

<IMG SRC="DINO1.gif" ALIGN=left><H3>The Dinosaur Tree</H3>
<P>The Ginkgo tree is the sole surviving member of an ancient family.  During the Mesozoic Era dinosaurs roamed the earth in forests full of these primitive trees.
The Ginkgo is a deciduous broadleaf tree, but is unique because it is related closely to conifers.
Scientists once believed the Ginkgo survived only because of its cultivation as a sacred tree in China temple gardens.  However, wild Ginkgos have recently been found growing in remote valleys of western China.  The Ginkgo's fan-shaped leaves turn bright yellow in the fall, then drop all at once, making a loud "swoosh" sound.  This curious habit endears to anyone who wants to keep leaf raking to a minimum.  The
Ginkgo, as you might expect, is also highly adaptable.  It withstands Pollution, low sunlight, meager soil, and extreme temperatures.  It is virtually immune to disease and pests.  With all those traits, the Ginkgo should be around for another 200 million years.</P>

<H3>Does Peanut Butter
Grow on Trees?</H3>
<P>The Harlequin Glorybower, a small garden tree that has pretty white flowers in late summer, is also known as the peanut butter tree.  The next time you're in a nursery, crush one of its leaves between your finger and sniff it.  Many people think that the scent is similar to peanut butter.  Unfortunately, the leaves make a lousy sandwich, even with jelly.</P>
