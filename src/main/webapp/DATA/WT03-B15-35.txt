<P>On 13 December 1996 Koigi wa Wamwere was released on bail from imprisonment on the grounds of ill-health.  He remains in Nairobi Hospital and is due to travel to the United Kingdom shortly for the urgent medical treatment which he needs for his heart complaint. 

<P>Speaking by telephone from the hospital to a member of Amnesty International’s International Secretariat, Koigi wa Wamwere said that he was "very, very happy for all the work that Amnesty International has done on my behalf".  He requested that his deep gratitude be passed on to everybody who had sent appeals, saying that he believed these had had a crucial effect in both preventing a death sentence in October 1995 and in his current release.  He expressed the hope that he will "get an opportunity to thank them in a better way".

<P>Amnesty International welcomes the release of Koigi wa Wamwere but continues to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Charles Kuria Wamwere and G.G. Njuguna Ngengi as prisoners of conscience. Both are in need of the special diets they have been prescribed in hospital but are reportedly not receiving.  G.G. Njuguna Ngengi has non-insulin dependent diabetes and Charles Kuria Wamwere has a stomach problem, and their poor diets mean that these complaints are exacerbated.

<P><B>FURTHER RECOMMENDED ACTION: Please send telegrams/telexes/faxes/express/ airmail letters in English or in your own language:</B>
- welcoming the release on bail of Koigi wa Wamwere for medical treatment abroad;<BR>
- urging that, as a prisoner of conscience, his release be made unconditional;<BR>
- expressing renewed concern for G.G. Njuguna Ngengi and Charles Kuria Wamwere and urging that they be released immediately and unconditionally as prisoners of conscience;<BR>
- urging that as a matter of priority their medically prescribed diets be provided.
