SMALL CHANGE: THE ECONOMICS OF CHILD SUPPORT by Andrea H. Beller and John
W. Graham, Yale University Press, 1993<BR>

In their book, SMALL CHANGE: THE ECONOMICS OF CHILD SUPPORT, Andrea Beller
and John Graham examine aggregate trends in child support over the period
1978-1986. Their analyses rely on data gleaned in the child support supplement
to the Current Population Survey, first administered in 1979 and conducted
biennially thereafter. The combined data set they manipulate contains information
about 16,000 mothers eligible for child support including 4,000 black and
3,000 never married mothers. This allows the authors to compare child support
experience for blacks and non-blacks, married and never-married parents.
Their analyses occur within a framework of economic modelling that emphasizes
the benefits and costs of child support for mothers and the fathers' ability
and willingness to pay in explaining child support outcomes.<BR>
<BR>
Beller and Graham reach a number of conclusions about the child support
system and how it has evolved during a time period of increasing federal
involvement. Their findings underscore the inadequacy of the system for
black and never married women, sub- groups that have grown disproportionately
in the last few decades. On virtually every indicator of child support outcome,
these women fare dramatically worse than their non-black and ever-married
counterparts. Granted, AFDC recipients, many of whom are black and/or never
married, have received disproportionate enforcement attention by child support
agencies and these populations have consequently experienced certain increases
in award and collection rates. Nevertheless, their overall standing with
respect to awards, order levels and receipts lag far behind. Although the
authors do not focus on the policy implications of this finding, it does
raise serious questions about the whole premise of private transfer as a
remedy for those with out-of-wedlock births and minority poverty.<BR>
<BR>
Among non-black and ever-married women, the authors find evidence of only
small increases in award and receipt rates, suggesting that efforts to strengthen
child support enforcement may have been partially successful. Although they
find no evidence that government spending for child support has increased
child support receipts, they find some evidence that certain enforcement
techniques have been helpful including criminal penalties and wage withholding.
Administrative procedures, on the other hand, appear to be associated with
lower receipt rates. It should be noted that these data were collected prior
to the implementation of many new aggressive enforcement remedies.<BR>
<BR>
In any event, evidence of modest increases in award and receipt rates were
more than offset by a 25 percent decline in the real dollar amount of child
support payments made during 1978-1986. The authors attribute this to the
failure of child support order levels to keep up with inflation and changes
in the real incomes of fathers, although they note that real incomes of
fathers stagnated after 1973. The obvious remedy to this problem is the
utilization of child support guidelines to establish order levels that reflect
parental income. This too became mandatory in 1988 pursuant to the enactment
of the Family Support Act, along with requirements for periodic review and
updating of old awards at the request of either party. Again, given the
time frame of their study, Beller and Graham offer no reading on the impact
of these and other provisions of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments
of 1984 and the 1988 Family Support Act.<BR>
<BR>
My biggest frustration with this book is that it feels out of date. The
last year for which data was utilized in this study was 1986. Since then,
legislation has been enacted requiring states to improve paternity establishment
or face financial penalties, utilize presumptive child support guidelines,
institute periodic updating of child support awards and routinely use income

withholding and other enforcement remedies. The architects of child support
guidelines and other remedies embodied in recent legislation have predicted
dramatic impacts on child support award and payment patterns. The research
that my colleagues and I have conducted comparing awards promulgated prior
to and following the adoption of presumptive guidelines in specific jurisdictions
suggests that these impacts have been extremely modest. Has the new legislation
translated into substantial gains? Which sub-groups, if any, have benefitted?
Why and why not? To my mind, these are the vital questions that need to
be addressed. Unfortunately, this book does not do the job. <BR>
<BR>
Another frustration I have with this book is the nature of the CPS data
they utilized to operationalize the variables in their model. Father's ability
to pay was measured by the socioeconomic characteristics of mothers and
was supplemented by mean income data of year-round, full-time male workers
by race. In a similar vein, information about the mother was used to represent
father's desire to pay child support. Even mother's expected benefits and
costs were indirectly measured through the limited available data on her
marital status, education level and numbers and ages of her children. There
were absolutely no direct measures of many of the determinants of child
support outcomes including father's income, father's employment status and
stability, father's remarriage, current living arrangements for mothers
and fathers, custody and visitation arrangements and the relationship between
the parents.<BR>
<BR>
The authors concede these limitations but indicate that they aren't so critical
given their interest in revealing racial and marital status differentials
and trends over time. Critical or not, the result is a limited book that
documents what is obvious to anyone who has worked with the child support
system: that it is bad for everyone but worse for blacks and never-marrieds.
