	When Chairman Harry Hohn was asked in 1994 to describe New York Life's most difficult long-term
problem, he
summed up the answer in a single word: "demographics."<P>
	The official demographic measurement of household income in 1990 provided by the U.S.
government was a bit shocking.  Not all boats had risen in the 1980s.  In 1990, according to
the IRS,
some ten percent of U.S. households had incomes over $75,000.  That was the good news.  But
the
remaining 90 percent were hardly awash in wealth.  The majority of households, three-quarters
of the
total, had incomes under $50,000.  And a remarkable forty-two percent were living by the skin
of their
teeth.  Just as the government had plunged into deficit financing, so had individuals.<P>

	
	In a drive to find new avenues of distribution, New York Life created the Brokerage
Department in
1992.  Its focus is and has been independent producers who serve customers in the top one to
two
percent of the wealthiest households in the United States and large corporate clients.<P>

	
	The experience with the brokerage business encouraged New York Life to seek other
distribution
opportunities.  In a departure from the way it traditionally sells products, the company
announced a
unique 10-year direct marketing opportunity in April 1994.  The American Association of
Retired
Persons (AARP), a 33-million-member organization dedicated to addressing the needs of persons
aged 50 and older, selected New York Life Insurance Company from numerous competitors to
underwrite, market and administer a newly designed life insurance program for its members.<P>
	
<P>
	In 1984, New York Life expanded its investments focus to include the independent active
management of stocks and bonds by purchasing MacKay-Shields Financial Corporation, a
blue-chip, active money
manager
based in Manhattan.  In 1987, Monitor Capital Advisors was created as an independent
subsidiary of
New York Life focusing on the passive, quantitative strategies of stocks and bonds.  In 1988,
Greystone
Realty Corporation, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, was founded to provide independent
professional management of equity real estate.<P>
	<P>
	In order to compete effectively in the ever-expanding defined contribution market, the
company made
a major acquisition that year, buying a Boston-based benefits consulting and administrative
firm, now
renamed New York Life Benefit Services.  New York Life now has the capabilities to compete as a
"full-service"
provider in the 401(k) market.<P>
	The company had reentered the international life insurance market in 1988 with the
acquisition of a
life insurance company in Hong Kong. That year, it formed New York Life Worldwide.  The
international
re-entry continued in 1989 with the acquisition of Windsor Group, a life insurance firm based
in
England.  Three years later, the Gresham Group, another British life insurer, was acquired.
<P>
	Ever since its founding, New York Life managers and agents have been conscious that the
actions of
the company are often far reaching.  The character, and perhaps the stability, of American
society have
been affected by organizations that try to look beyond the statistics to act as good
corporate citizens.<P>
	"[I describe] life insurance using the Latin sui generis."  Hohn continues, "Sui generis
means 'unique
unto itself.'  And life insurance is unique unto itself.  It's the only way that you can have
a person who
just gets married and has the first baby or two and provide for them right then and there by
paying a
premium on a life insurance policy.  That's invaluable.  That's unique.  And that's one of
the reasons
why we are in business - to provide those benefits.<P>
	"Suppose there weren't life insurance - how would you arrange for your own family?  We
provide a
very basic tenet that we all rely upon.  We do a lot of other things but that's our core
competency, and we
do it, I think, very well.<P>
	And so we're going to be around for another 150 years - and more.  You can count on it."
