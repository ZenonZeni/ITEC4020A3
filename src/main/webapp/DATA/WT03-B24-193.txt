Subject: [bioglobe 12] Topic on Hepatitis C Virus <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I would like to introduce some topics periodically on research and development in Japanese universities and companies from my experience as a subscriber. A topic I introduce today is a matter Japanese researchers have constructed for a long time from the time of hepatitis B virus, that is a topic about hepatitis C virus. I explain the RD circumstances of hepatitis C virus in Japan. As you know, interferons are currently used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis (HCV)whose market size is more than US$1 billion in Japan. However, the efficacy is limited to a small part of the patients due to insufficient suppression of HCV replication. Therefore, another reliable anti-HCV agent is necessary to control HCV hepatitis. Recombinant DNA techniques revealed that HCV had a positive-strand RNA of approximately 9400 nt long which coded a single polyprotein about 3010 amino acids. In contrast to the cleavage of the structural proteins of the virus by the host enzyme, the non-strucural proteins are released by the action of virus-coded proteinases which are serine type proteinase and metalloproteinase. Especially, serine type proteinase is proven to be different from already known enzymes and this enzyme is expected to be an attractive target for an antiviral therapy. Japanese NIH, NCI and some companies have independently cloned original HCV proteinase genes from the HCV positive sera into a plasmid of E.coli and have checked the activity to cleavage a substrate protein. In the long run, the in vitro HCV proteinase assay system has been established. Furthermore, using this assay system, screening of inhibitors against this enzyme has started in each party. Especially, of several cleavage sites, NS5A/NS5B substrate site as the best substrate for the cleavage in trans has been expected and already some kinds of inhibitors have been detected. This type of enzyme is different from the host-derived known enzymes so that a ideal drug without a side effect may be available in very near future. Fortunately, some persons from a basic research field have entered with NMR and X-rays analysis. In Japan, the diagnostic system has been established so that I expect by some calculation after 40 years HCV will be disappeared. The problem we should solve is to cure persons of chronic hepatitis and patients of chronic hepatitis shifted to cirrhosis and hepatoma whose patients number is more than 1 million at this time in Japan. I believe firmly glad tidings will be available in very near future!<P> </BLOCKQUOTE>
