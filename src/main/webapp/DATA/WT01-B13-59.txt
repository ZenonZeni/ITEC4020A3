<b>An address given to the National Conference of State Legislatures, St. Louis, July 28, 1996</b>
<p>


America's system of federalism will face unique challenges during the
late 1990's and early years of the 21st century.
<p>
The Congress wants to devolve more responsibilities to the states at the same
time that the costs of funding traditional services, such as Medicare and
education, are projected to rise sharply.  As a result of the long expansion
which the U.S. economy has enjoyed since 1991, most states are currently in
good fiscal shape but the late 1990's could produce great financial stresses
for them if their increased responsibilities coincide with a recession.
Indeed, it would not be an exaggeration to suggest that devolution against a
background of recession could set the stage for other radical policy changes,
such as the privatization of many state owned enterprises and services.<p>
<p>
The fiscal challenge which will confront American states during the late 1990's
has several dimensions.<p>
<p>
First, the Congress wants to reduce the aid which it provides to American
states as well as to alter the formulas through which it is distributed.  In
the budget debate, six months ago, the Congress wanted to reduce federal
assistance to the states by 26%.  It is doubtful that future cuts will be that
large but it is not difficult to imagine cuts of 15-20% if Congress continues
to push for a balanced federal budget by the year 2000.   The pressure to
reduce federal laid to the states does not just reflect the political ideology
of the newly ascendant Republican Party.  It is also a by-product of
demographic factors.  The population of the U.S. will age steadily during the
next few decades and cause entitlement spending for the retired to rise
sharply.  The federal government share of GDP will also increase significantly
unless other forms of spending are curtailed.  The problem of demography in the
U.S. is much less serious than in other industrial countries because of its
high level of immigration and higher birthrate but aging is still a general
problem for all the industrial nations.  In fact, two thirds of all the people
who have ever lived to the age of 65 in the long history of mankind are alive
today.  Such simple facts reveal more about the forces driving public spending
in the modern world than all the political science journals which debate the
philosophical implications of public spending choices.<p>
<p>
Secondly, the Congress wants to shift from open ended matching grant assistance
to the states to block grants.  Under the new system, the states would receive
a fixed sum of money and be given more flexibility in how they chose to spend
it.  But in contrast to the current system, their aid would not increase
automatically in response to some economic shock, such as a recession.  The new
system of financing would represent a sharp break with the pattern of financing
which has prevailed during most of the modern era under both Democratic and
Republican administrations.  During the Bush administration, for example,
federal aid to the states rose from $124 billion to $194 billion.  Much of the
increase resulted from the impact of the 1990-1991 recession on social service
programs. But part of it also resulted from the states shifting Medicaid costs
to the federal government as well as increases in matching grants from other
federally mandated programs.  As a result of the growth of federal spending
during the Bush years, aid to the states is currently equal to about 3.2% of
GDP compared to a post war peak of 3.6% of GDP in 1973, 1.9% in 1965, and 0.9%
in 1940.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, despite the sharp drop in the U.S. inflation rate, the federal budget
is projecting that Medicaid spending will continue to rise at a 8% annual rate.
In the federal budget,  Medicaid expenditures will grow from $168 billion to
$267 billion.  As the states account for about 43% of Medicaid spending, their
outlays will also expand.  Some states are trying to control costs by forcing
their recipients to use HMO's, but in many states there is so much public
hostility to HMO's that legislatures are enacting laws which require them to be
less severe in rationing their services.<p>
<p>
Fourthly, the population of school age children is once again expanding.  It is
projected to grow from 47 million in 1991 to 56 million in 2004, surpassing the
old 1971 peak of 51 million.  The GAO says that the U.S. needs to spend $112
billion on new school construction compared to recent outlays of $3 billion per
annum.<p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the U.S. electorate remains hostile to the idea of tax increases.
Almost none were enacted by state legislatures during the past two years while
the Congress itself flirted with the idea of reducing federal gasoline taxes a
few months ago.<p>
<p>
There is also growing public opposition to the spread of gambling.  Lotteries
will probably continue to generate revenue equal to about 2.5% of state tax
receipts, but there will be far more restrictions on the introduction of new
casinos.  It appears that only three states will permit the establishment of
significant casino industries.  They are Nevada, New Jersey and Mississippi.
<p>
<p>
The good news is that state governments are in better fiscal shape to confront
these challenges then at any other time during the past decade.<p>
<p>
The economy has enjoyed five years of steady growth, so the state and local
government sector enjoys a healthy budget surplus.  There also have been far
fewer  regional disparities in the national economy's performance during the
current expansion than was the case during the 1970's and 1980's.<p>
<p>
In the 1970's, the U.S. economy's growth leaders were states producing oil and
other commodities enjoying sharply higher prices.  In the 1980's, there were
booms on both coasts while the middle west suffered from the overvalued dollar
and the western states were crippled by collapsing commodity prices and bankin
crisis.  In the early 1990's, new England and California experienced severe
slumps but both have recovered during recent years while other regions have
continued to enjoy steady growth.<p>
<p>
As a result of the length and breadth of the national expansion, the state and
local government sector currently enjoys a budget surplus of $40 billion
excluding pension funds compared to $11 billion five years ago.  The surplus as
a share of GDP is only about 0.6% or well below the 1.2% peak of the 1980's
business cycle but it is a respectable number for an expansion which has been
characterized by such low inflation.<p>
<p>
The U.S. economy's current cyclical environment is exceptionally benign for the
sixth year of a business cycle.  The unemployment rate has dropped to 5.3% but
inflation is still only about 3.0% excluding food and fuel.    The growth rate
of real output is likely to average about 2.6% this year compared to 2.0% last
year and 3.5% during 1994.<p>
<p>
The economy's outstanding inflation performance has surprised many analysts and
explains why the business cycle has been so prolonged.  The Federal Reserve has
had no incentive to surpress the expansion in order to promote price
stability.<p>
<p>
There are several factors which explain why the U.S. economy has been able to
enjoy such a benign combination of low unemployment and low inflation.<p>
First, the current business cycle has enjoyed some very positive supply side
characteristics.  There has been such robust business investment that during
the past two years the growth rate of manufacturing capacity has accelerated to
nearly 4.5% from 2.0% during the early 1990's.<p>
<p>
Secondly, U.S. firms have been very aggressive in controlling costs and
boosting productivity.  The restructuring has created social concerns about
employment stability, especially in large companies, but the growth of profits
has helped to set the stage for an extraordinary boom in job creation.  Total
employment has expanded by over 10 million spare jobs since 1992 whereas during
the period 1988-1992 it grew by only about 3.5 million jobs.<p>
<p>
Thirdly, American firms have been on the cutting edge of developing and
introducing new technology. In the U.S., the ratio of computers to workers is
now at 57 per 100 in the corporate sector compared to 20 in Western Europe, 16
in Japan, and 4 in southeast Asia. There are new technology oriented companies
on the stock market with capitalizations of $2-3 billion which did not exist
three years ago.  The Internet firm, Netscape, now has a market capitalization
of $3.9 billion compared to zero two years ago.  The capitalization of
Microsoft has expanded from $24 billion in 1992 to $75 billion recently.  IBM's
market capitalization has even rebounded to $55.5 from $28.5 billion in late
1992 but is still far below its peak of over $100 billion in the late 1980's.<p>
<p>
Fourthly, the Federal Reserve has done an excellent job of managing the
business cycle.  There was an upsurge of output growth during 1994 which
strained available inventories and caused commodity prices to rise sharply.
This change in the price environment could have set the stage for an
acceleration in the inflation rate but the Fed moved quickly to reduce the
economy's growth rate to the 2.0-2.5% range from 3.5-4.0% in order to restrain
inflationary pressures  As a result, commodity prices corrected and the Fed was
able to ease monetary policy during early 1995.  The Fed will face new
challenges in restraining inflation later this year but it enjoys so much
credibility that the price of restraining inflation will be much less severe
than during the business cycles of the 1970's and early 1980's.<p>
