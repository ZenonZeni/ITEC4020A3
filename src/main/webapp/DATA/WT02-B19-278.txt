<CENTER><H3><B>MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN PORTER RE: IDEA FUNDING<BR>
</CENTER></H3><BR></B> 


In response to concerns about the possibility of IDEA programs not receiving funding if
a
reauthorization does not go through this year, CEC received a statement from Rep.
John Porter
(R-IL), the Chair of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education
Appropriations
Subcommittee, concerning funding for IDEA programs for FY 1997, but does not
specifically
discuss FY 1998.  Following is his office's statement:<P>

<dd>    "I serve as Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee which funds
     IDEA.  For Fiscal Year 1997, I included a total of $3.246 billion for special
     education programs for children with disabilities in the annual appropriation bill. 
     This funding level is significantly above the amount provided in fiscal year 1996. <P>
     
<dd>     I strongly support reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education
     Act (IDEA).  I am hopeful that the Congress will complete consideration of the
     IDEA reauthorization bill this year and that President Clinton will support this
     legislation.<P>
     
<dd>    Regardless of whether IDEA is reauthorized, I will continue to appropriate
     funding for IDEA through the subcommittee which I chair."<P>
     
In response to this statement, CEC put together a letter to the congressman's office, as
follows:<P>


August 21, 1996<P>


The Honorable John Porter<br>
U.S. House of Representatives<br>
Washington, D.C. 20510<P>


<dd>     Dear Representative Porter:<P>
     
<dd>     I was very pleased to read your recent statement of support for appropriations
     under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Your leadership
     has been essential and will be necessary again this year.<P>
     
<dd>     The many parents and professionals who make up CEC are deeply concerned
     about IDEA reauthorization.  There will be a reauthorization: it is just taking
     longer than anticipated. Unfortunately, while the dialogue on reauthorization
     continues,  the discretionary programs face increasing risk due to their lack of
     authorizing legislation.  Your recent statement of support for funding these
     programs regardless of the reauthorization timetable provides important
     reassurance that you will continue to work for the best interests of children with
     disabilities and their families.<P>
     
<Dd>     Regardless of when reauthorization is completed, CEC appreciates your
     Congressional leadership in recognizing the importance of each of the
     discretionary programs in providing the infrastructure and R&D functions
     essential to accomplishing the mission of IDEA. <P>
     
     Sincerely,<P>
     
     
     
     Nancy D. Safer<br>
     Executive Director<P>
