                Submitted:  November 29, 1995

                    Filed:  December 12, 1995


Before WOLLMAN, MAGILL, and HANSEN, Circuit Judges.


PER CURIAM.


     A jury found Thomas F. Brown guilty of one count of
manufacturing marijuana and one count of manufacturing peyote, in
violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(l), and found Brown used his
forty-acre tract of land to facilitate the manufacturing process,
thus subjecting the property to forfeiture under 21 U.S.C. § 853;
the district court1 sentenced Brown to 121 months imprisonment.
Brown challenges his conviction and sentence, and we affirm.

     In January 1994 Brown helped establish Our Church, and he
deeded one of his forty acres of property to the church.  The
covenants of deed provided that Our Church would produce medicinal
herbs and plants "possessed of the properties of spiritual
enlightenment" and would distribute such herbs to the sick.  Brown

_____________________
     1The Honorable H. Franklin Waters, Chief Judge, United States
District Court for the Western District cf Arkansas.
<hr>informed law enforcement officials and the media that Our Church
members intended to grow and distribute marijuana on the property;
Our Church members had a public marijuana planting ceremony.  In
August 1994 law enforcement officials seized 435 marijuana plants
and a bucket containing 3 peyote plants which had formed 5 buds.

     Following Brown's indictment, the government filed a motion in
limine to exclude from the trial any evidence or references
relating, inter alia, to Brown's contention that his religious
beliefs provided him with a legal right to grow or distribute
marijuana and peyote, and that the FirstAmendment and the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C.
§ 2000bb - 2000bb-4, provided him with a legal defense to the
charges.  At a one-day hearing on the motion in limine, Brown and
other Our Church members or participants testified about the role
marijuana played in their spiritual quest, how their interest in
supplying marijuana to the sick was part of their religious tenets,
and that church policy allowed distribution to anyone who wanted to
join the spiritual quest, including children with parental
permission.

     The district court assumed for the purposes of the hearing and
trial that Brown was engaged in the exercise of a religion, and
that the grand jury indictment was a burden on his free exercise of
that religion.  The court concluded, however, that the law clearly
established that the government had a compelling interest in
regulating marijuana and other drugs, and that the government had
tailored the interest as narrowly as it could to prevent the kinds
of dangers Congress believed existed.  Thus, the district court
concluded, as a matter of law, that the RFRA was not available to
Brown as a defense.  The court granted the government's motion in
limine, and barred admission at trial of all evidence covered in
the government's motion.

     After Brown's first two appointed attorneys were allowed to

                             -2-
<hr>withdraw because of disagreements with Brown over his
representation, the district court gave Brown the choice of
proceeding pro se with standby counsel or utilizing the full
assistance of counsel who would present his defense.  Brown chose
to proceed pro se rather than have counsel direct the course of the
representation.

     Following a two-day criminal trial, the jury returned a guilty
verdict on all three counts.  The district court sentenced Brown to
121 months imprisonment, four years supervised release, and $17,500
in fines.  Brown moved for a new trial, arguing only that he was
denied the assistance of counsel, which the district court denied.

     On appeal Brown argues (1) the district court erred in
restricting him from advancing any of his defenses at trial, (2)
the government lacked power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit
growing and using marijuana, (3) the court improperly denied him a
reduction for acceptance of responsibility at sentencing under
U.S.S.G. § 3E1.l, and (4) the court denied him assistance of
counsel.

     It is well established that religious conduct does not enjoy
the absolute constitutional protection afforded freedom of
religious belief. See United States v. Greene, 892 F.2d 453, 456
(6th Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 495 U.S. 935 (1990).  Under the
RFRA, the "[g]overnment may substantially burden a person's
exercise of religion only if it demonstrates that application of
the burden to the person--(l) is in furtherance of a compelling
governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of
furthering that compelling governmental interest."  42 U.S.C.
§ 2000bb-l(b).  See also United States v. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 256-59
(1982) (First Amendment challenge; standard for determining if law
interferes with religious conduct)

                              -3-
<hr>     We have recognized that the government has a compelling state
interest in controlling the use of marijuana.  See United States v.
Fogarty, 692 F.2d 542, 547-48 (8th Cir. 1982) (classification of
marijuana is rationally based and is matter for legislative, not
judicial, prerogative), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1040 (1983); see
also Greene, 892 F.2d at 455-56; United States v. Rush, 738 F.2d
497, 512-13 (1st Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1004 (1985);
United States v. Middleton, 690 F.2d 820, 822-24 (11th Cir. 1982),
cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1051 (1983)

     We agree with the district court that, based on Our Church's
broad use, the government could not have tailored the restriction
to accommodate Our Church and still protected against the kinds of
misuses it sought to prevent.  Cf. United States v. Merkt, 794 F.2d
950, 956-57 (5th Cir. 1986) (national border control laws), cert.
denied, 480 U.S. 946 (1987).  Thus, under the circumstances of this
case, we conclude the district court correctly determined that
Brown could not prevail under the RFRA or the First Amendment.  See
Rush, 738 F.2d at 513 (rejected First Amendment defense as matter
of law).  We also conclude the district court did not abuse its
discretion in disallowing Brown's other defenses.  See Fed. R.
Evid. 402; United States v. Hollister, 746 F.2d 420, 422 (8th Cir.
1984) (district court has broad discretion in determining
relevance).

     We need not consider Brown's Commerce Clause and sentencing
arguments because they are raised for the first time on appeal.
See Fritz v. United States, 995 F.2d 136, 137 (8th Cir. 1993),
cert. denied, 114 5. Ct. 887 (1994) (absent plain error, we will
not consider issues raised for first time on appeal).

     Finally, we note Brown does not have a constitutional right to
hybrid representation, see MoKaskie v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 184
(1984), which means he cannot demand the right to act as co-
counsel.  See United States v. Swinney, 970 F.2d 494, 497 (8th

                               -4-
<hr>Cir.), cert. denied, 113 5. Ct. 632 (1992), and cert. denied, 113
S. Ct. 1650 (1993).  The record is clear that, given the choice of
proceeding pro se with standby counsel or utilizing the full
assistance of counsel, Brown unequivocally chose to represent
himself.  Thus, the district court committed no error.

     Accordingly, Brown's conviction and sentence is affirmed.
