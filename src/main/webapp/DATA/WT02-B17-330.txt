<BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Conservation Recommendations and Impact</H3>

<UL>
<LI>In the <B>Madidi region of Bolivia</B>, RAP was crucial in directing the Global Environment Facility's (GEF) interests toward large areas that were not part of planned protected areas.  A year after RAP's original assessment report was circulated, the Bolivian government and the World Bank began negotiations for financial support of important conservation areas, and both ranked Madidi as one of six high-priority sites to receive significant funding. Madidi was declared a national park in October, 1995.
<P>
<LI>The <B>Kanuku Mountains Region of Guyana</B> is being considered for biosphere reserve designation after RAP highlighted its national significance.
<P>
<LI>In <B>Santa Cruz</B>, <B>Bolivia</B>, the team scientifically described the largest dry tropical forest in the world.  Part of <IMG SRC="../../../RESOURCE/SLIDES/BIOLOGY/Satmap.jpg" ALT="Satmap.jpg - 9.3 K" WIDTH=206 HEIGHT=140 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 BORDER=0 ALIGN=right>this several-million-hectare region will become part of Bolivia's protected system.
<P>
<LI>In <B>Peru</B>, RAP team members assisted in the development of a national park feasibility study leading to the creation of <B>The Tambopata-Candamo Reserved Zone</B>, a protected area of 1.5 million hectares.
<P>
<LI>In September 1995, RAP offered a training course in <B>Bolivia</B>.  The course focused on different methods for biological inventories, understanding the importance of scale and expertise in biological assessments using a landscape approach, and producing integrated reports with practical recommendations for conservation, management, monitoring, and environmental education.

<H3>Biological Knowledge</H3>

<UL>
<LI>In <B>Peru</B>, the team found one of the rarest birds in the world, the Southern Helmeted Curassow, previously known only from four museum specimens.
<P>
<LI>In <B>Condor, Ecuador</B>, a new species of mammal, a marsupial rat, was recently described by RAP scientist, Dr. Luis Albuja, from the Escuela Politecnica Nacional.
<P>
<LI>In <B>Condor, Peru</B>, 20 new species of butterflies, 18 new species of orchids, 2 new species of beetles, and 5 records of bird species were documented.
<P>
<LI>A brief trip to the <B>Choc&oacute; in Colombia</B> yielded remarkably high discovery rates for new vertebrate species.  Of some 70 reptiles and amphibians collected in four days, ten percent were previously undescribed.
<P>
<LI><B>In southern Mexico</B> the team discovered a new species of wild cacao, a finding that could broaden the gene pool, potentially providing higher productivity and disease resistance, for cultivated cacao.
</UL>

<H3>Future RAP Projects</H3>

<P>RAP plans to expand its coverage of the Andean region and the Asia-Pacific region:
<UL>



<LI>RAP plans to run a series of three trips over the next two-and-a-half years to the island of <B>New Guinea</B>, alternating between <B>Irian Jaya</B> (on the western portion of the island) and <B>Papua New Guinea</B> (on the eastern portion of the island).
<P>
<LI>A trip is also planned for <B>Vilcabamba, Peru</B>.
