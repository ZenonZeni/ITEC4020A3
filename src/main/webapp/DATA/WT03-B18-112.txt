<center><h1>Workspace 4.0 Information</h1></center>

<p>Workspace<sup>&copy;</sup> is the first robot simulation and off-line programming application running on the Windows 95 platform. The ability to take the simulation directly to the shop floor, allows users to eliminate time and inefficiencies associated with Silicon Graphics based systems costing up to 3 times the price of Workspace.</p>


<p><img src="gemcity.gif" width=200 height=150 border=1 align="RIGHT" alt="Workspace Screen Shot" hspace=5 vspace=5>Workspace 4.0 is the culmination of over 10 years of development to create a seamless simulation to programming application. Workspace 4.0 utilizes the latest in 32-bit graphics technology to give users GUI and screen representations that rival the Silicon Graphics machines. With reflective screen shading and solid 3D modeling, users will see their simulations come to life on the screen.</p>

<p>Workspace is the first seamless off-line robot programming system that allows users to program the simulation robot in the native language of their controller. The benefit is an immediate capability to download to the robot for testing and evaluation. There is no limit to the number of robots, brands and models that can be mixed within the simulation and programs written simultaneously to the cell design process.</p>

 
<p><img src="turbine.gif" width=200 height=143 border=1 align="LEFT" alt="Workspace Screen Shot" hspace=5 vspace=5>Workspace runs on the #1 selling PC platform, Windows 95, and is suitable for Windows NT. The portability of running on a personal computer or notebook allows users to take the applications out of the design room and directly to the production floor. This puts the power of engineering directly to the production line.</p> 

<p>Off-line programming has been deemed in the "Twilight Zone" of the robotics industry. At RWT, we create reality with Workspace as the software engine and <a href="robotrak/robotrak.htm" target="Main">Robotrak<sup>&copy;</sup></a>, robot calibration and signaturing. The missing component to achieving effective OLP in robotics is being able to consistently predict where the robot is going to go in relative space to the part and how that corresponds to the coordinates plotted in the programming application. This technology is now available and affordable. With paybacks of 10 times the initial investment in the first year by minimizing downtime Workspace and Robotrak will take your company out of the "Twilight Zone."</p>

<p><img src="spotweld.gif" width=200 height=150 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=1 align="RIGHT" alt="Workspace Screen Shot">Another component of the Workspace OLP process is the ability to import existing robot programs from the controllers, apply Robotrak calibrations and/or edit the program then re-install them into the robot controller by conventional means. By seamlessly creating the robot program while generating the simulation, Workspace also eliminates post-processing which has proven to create robot programs that, due to their miscalculations and language translations, defeat the benefits of OLP. Workspace, through native language programming, gives you a robot program that is ready to run your applications. Workspace has 28 of the most popular <a href="rbtlang/rbtlang.htm" target="Main">robot languages</a> ready for your use.</p>

<p>Simulation of robot workcells has taken on a new meaning with Workspace. Historically linked and housed in the design and engineering departments, Workspace on the PC now allows users to move from the traditional simulation departments and utilize the cell development process throughout the design to manufacturing arena. Workspace 4.0 has CAD importation of IGES and DXF to give quick access to your existing 3-D, solid model part, fixture and tool data. </p>

<p><img src="deburr.gif" width=200 height=150 hspace=5 vspace=5 border=0 align="LEFT" alt="Workspace Screen Shot">With a library of over 170 <a href="rbtlib/rbtlib.htm" target="Main">robot models</a>, we can generally provide your new or older, robot model with your order. If you have a model we do not have in the library, we can quickly model it and provide you a model with accurate kinematics.</p>

<p>Workspace 4.0 is easy to use and learn. Our corporate training facility in Fort Myers Beach, FL holds <a href="training/schedule.html" target="Main">monthly training classes </a>where you will learn the techniques to maximize your use of Workspace and Robotrak. With the look and feel of Windows based applications, Workspace has a short learning curve and a robot programming or CAD background will decrease your time to implementation.</p>
