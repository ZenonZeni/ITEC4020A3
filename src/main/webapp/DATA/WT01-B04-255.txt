<CENTER><B>THE HEART AND DOWN SYNDROME</B><P>

Abnormalities of the cardiovascular system are common in Down syndrome.  Approximately half of all infants born with Down syndrome have a heart defect.  Many of these defects have serious implications and it is important to understand them and how they may adversely affect the child so that we may provide the most appropriate medical care.<P>

<B>Question:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>What are the most common heart defects in children with Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>The most common defects are Atrioventricular Septal Defect (formally called Endocardial Cushion Defect), Ventricular Septal Defect, Persistent Ductus Arteriosus and Tetralogy of Fallot.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE> What is an Atrioventricular Septal Defect?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>An Atrioventricular Septal Defect is caused by a failure of tissue to come together in the heart during embryonic life.  This results in a large opening in the center of the heart, with usually a hole between the two pumping chambers (a Ventricular Septal Defect) and between the two collecting chambers (an Atrial Septal Defect) as well as abnormalities of the two atrioventricular valves, the mitral and tricuspid valves.  This defect occurs in nearly 60% of the children with Down syndrome who are born with congenital heart disease.  In less severe cases, Ventricular Septal Defects and Atrial Septal Defects can also occur separately.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>What is Persistent Ductus Arteriosus?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>The ductus arteriosus is a channel between the pulmonary artery and the aorta and during fetal life diverts blood away from the lungs.  After birth this channel usually closes on the first day of life.  If it does not close, it is termed "persistent" and results in an increased flow of blood into the lungs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>What is Tetralogy of Fallot?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>This is a term given to a heart condition in which there is both a Ventricular Septal Defect and a narrowing of the passage from the right ventricle to the lungs causing Pulmonary Stenosis.  The Pulmonary Stenosis causes the blue blood in the right ventricle to cross the Ventricular Septal Defect into the aorta and produces what is commonly called a "blue baby."</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Question:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>What are the effects of Atrioventricular Septal Defect, Ventricular Septal Defect and Persistent Ductus Arteriosus?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>These defects result in increased blood flow going to the lungs as the blood goes through the septal defects or the ductus from the high pressure left heart into the low pressure right heart.  This flooding of the lungs results in a buildup of pressure in the pulmonary circulation and this higher pressure and high flow leads to damage to the pulmonary circulation, and pulmonary hypertension.  In the first few months of life, signs of heart failure may be prominent with rapid breathing and failure to grow and gain weight.  Later, progressive damage to the blood vessels and the lungs may result in reversal of the shunt and blueness of the skin (cyanosis).</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>What is the relationship of heart defects to the respiratory system?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>The lungs of children with Down syndrome do not develop as fully as in the general population.  Consequently, the growth of blood vessels throughout the lungs is limited.  The narrowed arteries of the lungs hold potential for long-lasting damage in the face of increased pressure and flow of blood through the lungs.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>How are the defects diagnosed?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>Some children with Down syndrome and major heart defects will present with heart failure, difficulty breathing and failure to thrive in the newborn period; however, because in some children the defect may not be at first apparent, it is important that all children born with Down syndrome, even those who have no symptoms of heart disease, should have an echocardiogram in the first 2 or 3 months of life.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>What is the recommended treatment?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>Heart surgery to correct the defects is recommended and it must be done before age 5 or 6 months in order to prevent lung damage.  Although the complexity of the defects raises the risk of surgery slightly above that of surgery on children without Down syndrome, successful surgery will allow many of the affected children to thrive as well as any child with Down syndrome who is born with a normal heart.  There may be residual defects (such as imperfect valves, in cases of Atrioventricular Septal Defect), but their effect on health is often minimal.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>What are the guidelines for choosing a hospital?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>Look for a medical center in a major metropolitan area which has experience in open heart surgery on infants, and experience in operating on infants with Down syndrome in particular.  A hospital which conducts at least ten such operations a year, with a good survival rate, would be considered an experienced hospital.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE> What should be considered in selecting a surgical team?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B>  <BLOCKQUOTE>Again, experience, together with the parents' rapport with the physician, should be the determining factor in the choice.  It is important that an experienced anesthesiologist be selected, as children with Down syndrome often have airway problems.</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<B>SUMMARY</B><P>
<UL><H5>
*	Congenital cardiac defects occur in up to 50 percent of children with Down syndrome.<BR>

*	Early diagnosis via echocardiogram is crucial within the first two months of life, even if no symptoms are present.<BR>

*	The majority of heart defects in children with Down syndrome can be surgically corrected with resulting long-term health improvements.<BR>

*	Experience and success are the key factors in selecting a hospital and surgical team for heart surgery on infants with Down syndrome.<BR><P>

ENDOCRINE CONDITIONS IN 
DOWN SYNDROME</B><P>
by<p>

Dr. Ernest McCoy<br>
Professor of Pediatrics<BR>
University of Alberta<P>

</CENTER>
Individuals with Down syndrome have a higher incidence of endocrine problems than the general population.  The endocrine system refers to a set of glands which includes the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands.<p>

<B>Question:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE> What is hypothyroidism?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Hypothyroidism results from a malfunctioning thyroid gland, which decreases the synthesis of the hormone thyroxin.  Thyroxin is the hormone that promotes growth of the brain and other body tissue.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE> How common is hypothyroidism?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Hypothyroidism is the most common endocrine problem in children with Down syndrome.  One study showed these individuals to be 28 times more prone to congenital hypothyroidism than the general population.  It is estimated that approximately ten percent of children with Down syndrome have congenital or acquired thyroid disease.  Incidence of thyroid disease in adults with this genetic disorder varies from 13 to 50 percent.  Hypothyroidism can occur at any time from infancy through adulthood.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  How is hypothyroidism diagnosed?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  All individuals with Down syndrome should be tested for hypothyroidism at birth, and at periodic intervals (at least every two years) thereafter.  The indicators of hypothyroidism---enlarged tongue, constipation, poor circulation---are also found in individuals who are not hypothyroid, so the blood test for thyroid function is an important diagnostic test.  As the thyroid hormone affects normal development of the brain, testing of infants is particularly crucial.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What treatment exists for hypothyroidism?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  The thyroid hormone, thyroxin, is readily replaced through medication.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is hyperthyroidism?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</b><BLOCKQUOTE>  In this case, the thyroid gland is overactive.  Symptoms are swelling in the neck, abnormal sweating, and rapid pulse rate.  No evidence exists as to whether hyperthyroidism is more prevalent in individuals with Down syndrome than in the general population.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is the treatment for hyperthyroidism?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  This thyroid malfunction can be treated pharmacologically, blocking the synthesis of thyroid hormone through medication.  It can also be treated with radioactive compounds to destroy the gland, or by surgically removing a portion of the thyroid gland.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Are people with Down syndrome more prone to diabetes?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  There is not sufficient data available at this point to know if there is increased risk for children with Down syndrome to develop type 1 diabetes as compared to the rate for their peers in the general population.  However, research suggests that individuals who develop one type of endocrine autoimmune disorder, such as thyroiditis, are more likely to develop a second disorder, such as type 1 diabetes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is the status of research on use of the growth hormone for children with Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Use of growth hormone for children with Down syndrome is still in experimental stages.  There are reports of increased rates of growth in children with down syndrome who received the hormone for a brief period; however, these reports were not controlled studies, so there is no scientific evidence that long-term administration of the hormone would increase final height.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Can any growth hormone be administered to any Down syndrome child?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  At present, doctors are licensed to prescribe growth hormone for individuals with Down syndrome only when there is a demonstrated deficiency of that hormone.  It is strongly advised that such treatment be obtained only through a clinical trial until long-term benefits are demonstrated.  </BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>SUMMARY</B><P>
<UL><H5>
*	Approximately 10 percent of children with Down syndrome, and between 13 to 50 percent of adults with this genetic disorder, have thyroid disease.  Hypothyroidism, an underfunctioning thyroid gland, is the most common condition.<P>

*	Hyporthyroidism must be diagnosed by a standard blood test, beginning at infancy and continuing at regular intervals throughout the life span.<P>

*	Hyporthyroidism is easily treated with replacement thyroxine hormone; treatment is particularly crucial for hypothyroid infants, as the hormone affects normal development of the brain.  However, this thyroid disease can be developed at any time in the life span.<P>

*	Hyperthyroidism is an overactive thyroid gland.  Diagnosis is also by blood test. The condition can be treated by medication, surgery, or use of radioactive iodine to destroy the gland.<P>

*	Insufficient evidence exists on the issue of whether individuals with Down syndrome are more prone to type 1 diabetes.  Research does suggest that individuals who develop one type of endocrine autoimmune disorder, such as thyroid disease, run a higher risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes.<P>

*	While some short-term uncontrolled studies on the use of growth hormone for children with down syndrome have demonstrated growth spurts, there is no long-term research to demonstrate an increase in final height.  Growth hormone should be administered only as part of a clinical trial until long-term benefits are demonstrated.<P>

<CENTER><B>ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</B><P>

by<P>

Dr. Ira Lott<BR>
Professor of Pediatrics<BR>
University of California at Irvine<P></CENTER>


Alzheimer's Disease, a degenerative neurological disorder characterized by progressive memory loss, personality deterioration and loss of functional motor capabilities, is far more common in individuals with Down syndrome than the general population.  However, not all individuals with Down syndrome will develop Alzheimer's disease, and even those showing Alzheimer's-type symptoms may not have Alzheimer's disease since other conditions can mimic the symptoms.<P>

<B>Question:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE> How common is Alzeheimer's disease in individuals with Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE> Estimates vary, but it seems reasonable to conclude that 25 percent or more of individuals with Down syndrome over age 35 show clinical signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's-type dementia; the percentage increases with age.  In the general population, Alzheimer's disease does not usually develop prior to age 50, and the highest incidence, in people over age 65, is between 5 and 10 percent.  The incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the Down syndrome population is estimated to be 3 to 5 times greater than in the general population.  </BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What are the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Early symptoms include loss of memory and logical thinking; personality change; decline in daily living skills; new onset of seizures; changes in coordination and gait; and loss of continence in bladder and bowel habits.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B> <BLOCKQUOTE> Aren't these symptoms common to some other diseases and conditions, especially depression?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Yes.  Alzheimer's disease is difficult to diagnose.  It is important to be certain Alzheimer's-type symptoms do not arise from other conditions, namely thyroid disorders, depressive illness by psychiatric criteria, brain tumor, recurrent brain strokes, metabolic imbalances, and various neurological conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  How is final diagnosis ascertained?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is made on the basis of clinical history, showing a slow, steady decrease in cognitive function, and a variety of laboratory tests which provide contributory evidence, including electroencephalogram, brain stem auditory evoked response, computerized transaxial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging among other tests and measurements.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Is there a base line test that can be repeated at intervals to determine specific decrease in cognitive function?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Psychologists use questionnaires that assist in the early detection of dementia.  It is recommended that individuals with Down syndrome be tested at age 30 to provide a baseline reading, and periodically thereafter.  If the tests show deterioration, further tests must be made to rule out diseases which present similar symptoms.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What information has research yielded thus far about a link between Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Current research shows that the extra "gene dosage" caused by the abnormal third chromosome of Down syndrome may have a causative relationship for Alzheimer's disease.  Interest is also focused on the early onset of Alzheimer's in individuals with Down syndrome, which may be related to the early aging of the Down syndrome brain.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  How can research into the Alzheimer's-Down syndrome be advanced?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Research into the linkage has been slowed due to the paucity of Down syndrome brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's disease.  Contributions to a brain tissue repository for purposes of extending knowledge about the relationship between Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease will help to advance research in this area.  For information for families and physicians considering such a donation, please contact the National Down Syndrome Society at 800-221-4602.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<B>SUMMARY</B><P>
<UL><h5>
*	Individuals with Down syndrome are 3 to 5 times more likely than the general population to develop Alzheimer's disease.  Onset of Alzheimer's may begin as early as age 30 in the Down syndrome population as compared to age 50 in the general population.<P>

*	Symptoms of a variety of other diseases and conditions mimic the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease:  personality change, decline in daily living skills, memory loss, changes in coordination and gait and other changes.  Diseases and conditions such as depression, thyroid disorders, brain tumor, recurrent brain strokes, metabolic imbalances, and various neurological conditions must be ruled out prior to diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.<P>

*	It is recommended that individuals with Down syndrome take a baseline test of cognitive function at age 30, and that this test be repeated annually to determine any deterioration in this function.  Some Alzheimer's disease symptoms can be treated, although there is no current means of curing or arresting the disease.<P>

*	Current research suggests a causative link between the extra "gene dosage" from the third chromosome 21 of Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease.  To advance research, donations of brain tissue from individuals with Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease are being sought.<P>

SEXUALITY IN DOWN SYNDROME</B><P>

by<P>

Dr. William Schwab<BR>
Associate Professor<BR>
Department of Family Medicine and Practice<BR>
University of Wisconsin<P>
</CENTER>

Human sexuality encompasses an individual's self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and social experiences relating to dating, marriage, and the physical aspects of sex.  Sex education, appropriate for the developmental level and intellectual attainment of individuals with Down syndrome, helps in engendering healthy sexuality, preventing unwanted pregnancy and diseases, and in alleviating other problems related to sexual function.<P>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Do individuals with Down syndrome have sexual feelings?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  In the past, sexuality was not considered an issue for young people with Down syndrome because of the inaccurate belief that mental retardation was equivalent to permanent childhood.  In fact, all people with Down syndrome do have intimacy needs, and it is important that these be recognized and planned for in education, residential and other programs and settings.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Do children with Down syndrome develop physically the same way as their peers in the general population?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Children with Down syndrome experience the same sequence of physical and hormonal changes associated with puberty as other children their age.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Do children with Down syndrome experience the emotional upheavals characteristic of adolescence?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  The emotional changes characteristic of adolescence are also present in children with Down syndrome, and may be intensified by social factors.  Any adolescent who lives in the community, attends school, and is exposed to media inevitably develops an awareness of sexuality.  Teenagers and young adults with Down syndrome often express interest in dating, marriage and parenthood.  They can be expected to experience typical adolescent changes in mood and outlook.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What kind of sex education is appropriate for individuals with Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  To be effective, education must be individualized and understandable, focusing not only on the physical reproductive aspects, but also positioning sexuality within the context of all interpersonal relationships.  An ideal curriculum will ensure that the individual's understanding of relationships, sexual intercourse and parenting is factual, realistic, and socially acceptable.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  How can healthy sexuality be encouraged for individuals with Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Creating an environment conducive to healthy sexual expression must be considered in designing educational, vocational, recreational and residential programs.  Positive sexual awareness can only develop through self-esteem, understanding of social relationships, and personal interaction/communication skills.  All these factors influence how intimacy needs are met.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Do women with Down syndrome have any special needs or concerns in regard to birth control?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Women with Down syndrome are fertile and may use any method of contraception without added medical risk.  The method chosen will depend on personal preference, ability to use the contraceptive effectively, and possible side effects.  Surgical sterilization may also be performed without added risk for women with Down syndrome who are in stable medical condition; however, availability of this procedure to women who are developmentally disabled may be controlled by state law.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Are there any special needs for individuals with Down syndrome in regard to disease prevention?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Men and women with Down syndrome have the same susceptibility to sexually transmitted diseases as the rest of the population.  Use of condoms during sexual intercourse is the best known form of protection against AIDS, herpes and other sexually transmitted diseases.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  How can a person with Down syndrome be protected against sexual abuse?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  It is highly recommended that age-appropriate education in protective behaviors should begin in childhood and be reinforced throughout the life of the person with Down syndrome.  Individuals with Down syndrome must be taught the boundaries of normal physical interactions in the social sphere, as well as the self-assertion skills to enlist help if necessary.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><CENTER>FEMALE SEXUALITY IN DOWN SYNDROME</CENTER></B><P>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Do girls with Down syndrome have normal menstrual periods?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Menstruation for girls with Down syndrome is no different than for their peers in the general population.  On the average, they begin menstruating at age 12 1/2, but may begin as early as age 10 or as late as age 14 without being in any way abnormal.  Most girls with Down syndrome have regular cycles with the same minor irregularities typical of their peer group.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  If a women with Down syndrome experiences major irregularities of the menstrual cycle, what problems with this point to other than pregnancy?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Alterations in a previously regular cycle may be due to the normal process of aging, or may be a sign of emerging hyperthyroidism.  Ongoing irregularity of menstrual cycle warrants medical examination.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  If a woman with Down syndrome becomes pregnant, will the baby be normal?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  At least half of all women with Down syndrome do ovulate and are fertile.  Between 35 and 50 percent of children born to mothers with Down syndrome will have trisomy 21 or other developmental difficulties.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  When is the onset of menopause for women with Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Menopause may occur at a wide range of ages.  Typically it takes place after age 40.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>MALE SEXUALITY IN DOWN SYNDROME</B></CENTER><P>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Are males with Down syndrome fertile?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Scientific information about the fertility of men with Down syndrome is limited.  While most textbooks indicate that no man with Down syndrome is known to have fathered a child, geneticists in England recently reported a case in which the paternity of a man with Down syndrome was confirmed.  It is likely that additional cases will be recognized---especially as more men have the opportunity to live in the community and develop intimate relationships.  It is not known if the offspring of men with Down syndrome are more likely to have Down syndrome or other anomalies.  It does seem clear that, in general, men with Down syndrome have a lower overall fertility rate than that of other men of comparable ages.  An individual's status can be partially assessed by having a semen analysis done, but this may not be definitive.  Therefore, if a couple desires pregnancy prevention, contraception should always be used.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Does the boy with Down syndrome mature later than his peer group in the general population?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  The onset of puberty in boys may be slightly delayed, but this is not a major factor.  Genital anatomy is comparable to that of boys who do not have Down syndrome.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>SUMMARY</B><P>
<UL><H5>
*	People with Down syndrome experience the same range of sexual feelings as the general population.<P>

*	Teenagers with Down syndrome undergo the same changes at puberty as all adolescents, though these changes may be slightly delayed for boys with Down syndrome.<P>

*	There is at least one known case of a man with Down syndrome fathering a child.  While the overall fertility of men with Down syndrome may be reduced, it is still advisable that couples use contraception whenever pregnancy prevention is desired.<P>

*	At least 50 percent of women with Down syndrome are fertile.  Healthy females can use contraception without added medical risk.<P>

*	Education is an appropriate and highly desirable component in developing positive sexual awareness for the individuals with Down syndrome.<P>

Neurology, the study of the human nervous system and its disorders, is important in the clinical care treatment of a person with Down syndrome.  The nervous system is always affected in Down syndrome; among the most common involvements of the nervous system are developmental disabilities (retardation in mental development and motor capabilities), hypotonia, atlantoaxial dislocation, and seizures.<P>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What does the term "developmental disabilities" mean in relation to Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  This term refers to incomplete development of the brain, which leads to both mental retardation and to slowed and/or incomplete mastery of physical coordination.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is known about brain pathology in regard to developmental difficulties?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Pathology in the Down syndrome brain includes a slightly smaller brain size for age, a shorter diameter for the anterior-posterior brain measurement, an unusually steep slope to the posterior portions of the brain, and an insufficiently developed superior temporal gyrus.  It is not known in what way these features contribute to the developmental disabilities of Down syndrome.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE> Has any progress been made in the pathology of the Down syndrome brain through research?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Research in this area is being actively pursued, especially since it may yield clues to Alzheimer's disease and to the neuroscientific effects on learning and memory.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Is IQ (intelligence quotient) a meaningful measure in Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  No.  IQ is not an adequate measure of the functional status of people with Down syndrome.  For example, individuals with Down syndrome may have difficulty with grammar, but understand individual words, or have a sense of when to speak, at a par with their mental age.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What can be done to help people with Down syndrome to achieve their full potential in the face of such disabilities?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  A variety of intervention programs, designed to begin in infancy and continue throughout learning years, help children with Down syndrome maximize their capabilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is hypotonia?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Hypotonia refers to the reduced muscle tone that occurs in virtually all infants with Down syndrome.  It is commonly seen in the flexor group, muscles which act to flex a joint.  The muscle weakness ranges from mild to moderate to severe.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  How is hypotonia diagnosed?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Common hypotonic symptoms are a lagging head when the child is pulled into a sitting position, and arching of the back when carried upright or lying on the stomach.  In addition, hypotonic children will tire more easily and adopt movement patterns requiring the least expenditure of energy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Are there any effective interventions for hypotonia?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Hypotonic conditions tend to improve with age.  Gross motor programs offered by occupational and physical therapists have been shown to diminish hypotonic symptoms.  These programs improve large body movements, such as walking, turning, sitting, standing and climbing stairs. Enrollment of children in an early intervention program which includes gross motor programs is recommended at the earliest feasible age, generally between 4 and 6 weeks of age.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is atlantoaxial dislocation?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Atlantoaxial dislocation refers to a problem caused by hypotonia.  The ligaments at the first two cervical vertebra are more relaxed than they should be, putting the individual at risk of spinal cord compression and injury.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  How common is atlantoaxial dislocation?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  The cervical spine instability occurs in 10 to 20 percent of children with down syndrome; however, actual spinal compression is rare.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What are the symptoms of atlantoaxial dislocation?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  If symptoms are present, they include neck pain, change in gait, onset of weakness in the extremities, spasticity, limited neck movement, and bowel/bladder incontinence (particularly after toilet training has been accomplished).  However, most children with x-ray evidence of atlantoaxial dislocation have no apparent symptoms.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What preventive measures should be taken?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Since most children with atlantoaxial dislocation do not exhibit symptoms, lateral cervical x-rays are recommended for all children with Down syndrome after age two.  If the instability is present, but there are no symptoms, the appropriate precaution is to limit "high risk" activities which might overstress the neck.  These activities include high-jumping, diving, gymnastics, trampoline, and butterfly strokes in swimming.  To devise a safe exercise program for a symptom-free child with atlantoaxial dislocation, consult your doctor.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Is there any treatment for atlantoaxial dislocation?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  If symptoms are present, the atlantoaxial joint can be surgically fused.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is the incidence of seizures in Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  In the young child with Down syndrome, seizures are no more common than in the general population.  Beginning at age 20-30, the incidence of seizure disorder rises substantially in the Down syndrome population.  Research is ongoing as to whether the frequencies of seizures in individuals with Down syndrome is related to the aging of the brain.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is the typical seizure for a person with Down syndrome?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Seizures for individuals with Down syndrome commonly look like epileptic seizures:  jerking of arms and legs, and loss of consciousness.  Seizures can also take a mixed form, with staring spells and momentary lapses of attention.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Question:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  What is the treatment for seizures?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Answer:</B><BLOCKQUOTE>  Seizures can be controlled with standard anti-convulsant medication.</BLOCKQUOTE>

*	Atlantoaxial dislocation refers to a weakness of neck muscles that affects approximately 10 to 20 percent of children with Down syndrome.  Most cases are asymptomatic.  Preventive measures against neck injuries call for lateral cervical x-rays for all children with Down syndrome after age 2.  If atlantoaxial dislocation is present, high-risk activities such as jumping, diving, etc., should be limited.<P>

*	In cases of atlantoaxial dislocation where symptoms are present, the atlantoaxial joint can be surgically fused.<P>

*	Seizures are equally common in the child with Down syndrome as compared to the general same-age population.  After age 20, the incidence of seizures in the Down syndrome population increases substantially as compared to the general population.  Seizures can be controlled by standard anti-convulsant medication.<P>
