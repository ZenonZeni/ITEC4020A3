ATM IN THE PUBLIC NETWORK:
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR, WHO WILL DELIVER IT?

By Lawrence Gasman
Senior Contributing Editor

Just as the recent fuss over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) as
a transport technology for enterprise networking hubs was eclipsing
ATM's role in the public network, Sprint's announcement that it has
won a major government contract to supply ATM services has put
the subject of ATM in public networks back in the limelight.  Some
important questions are being raised:

"What is the relationship between ATM services and the carriers'
pre-broadband SMDS (switched multimegabit data service) and
frame relay services?"

"Who will be the leaders in the ATM market?"

"What is the relationship between private and public ATM?"

Answering the first of these questions is made more difficult by the
insistence, in most discussions of ATM, that ATM is one thing when
it really is two.  ATM is a switch/multiplexing technology that may
be deployed in the central office or on customer premises.  ATM is
also a future service provided by a carrier.  As a service, ATM
provides access to an ATM switch-ing/multiplexing fabric in much
the same way that ISDN provides access to an Nx64 Time-Division
Multiplexed (TDM) switching fabric.

As a switching/multiplexing technology there is no conflict between
ATM, on the one hand, and frame relay and SMDS, on the other.
On the contrary, ATM switches are the ideal switching technology
to underpin frame relay or SMDS.  StrataCom, the company that
pioneered frame relay switches, is well advanced in transitioning its
non-standard cell-based switches to ATM, for example.  But as a
service, ATM is a potential serious rival to SMDS and frame relay.

Even at this early stage of ATM development, this rivalry is
becoming apparent.  Sprint won its ATM service contract with the
Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in competition with AT&T and MCI, both of which
apparently planned to service the contract with SMDS or something
like it (see separate story).

And the overlap between ATM and earlier services has become
greater because of the recent specification by the ATM Forum
which includes a DS-3 (45 Mbps) interface to ATM.  Previously, the
only standard interfaces to ATM were the CCITT's OC-3 (155
Mbps) and OC-12 (620 Mbps) interfaces defined for the ATM
Layer of Broadband ISDN.

OC-3 and OC-12 are overkill for today's wide-area network
applications.  DS-3 is about right.  SMDS also works at rates up to
DS-3.  In fact, the ATM Forum's DS-3 interface and the SMDS
interface both borrow heavily from the work done for the IEEE's
802.6 Metropolitan Area Network.  Frame relay still operates at
rates of DS-1 and below, but BT North America (and perhaps other
carriers) may force frame relay up to DS-3.

DS-3 SMDS and "native" ATM services operating at DS-3 rates
have a lot in common.  But it remains unclear how well SMDS
would support applications involving real-time voice and/or real-
time video.  There probably would be no major problem with
running voice/video over SMDS, but SMDS is being marketed
primarily as a data-oriented LAN (local area network)
internetworking service, while ATM specifically was designed to
support virtually every kind of communications mode.  Many people
believe that multimedia communications--a combination of voice,
text, still-image, animation, and full-motion video--will be the "killer
application" for ATM.

Sprint is well positioned to exploit the multimedia-over-ATM
opportunity.  Not only will it be supplying the Energy Department
and NASA with ATM services, but it is also a major participant in
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's MAGIC test
bed.  Here Sprint will supply ATM backbone service for a
visualization application (visualization networking has many of the
same characteristics as multimedia).

Finally, Sprint is the market leader in the videoconferencing services
business.  And videoconferencing may well emerge as a vital
component of multimedia.

But the die is not yet cast.  MCI and AT&T have well-advanced
broadband plans, although ATM does not seem to be as central to
their plans as to Sprint's.  WilTel, on the other hand, has always
said that it wants to have an ATM backbone in place by 1993, and
WilTel's role may take on new significance if it forms a relationship
with British Telecom as expected.  Also, at the time of writing, the
Sprint DOE/NASA contract was not absolutely finalized.  So,
Sprint's ATM lead still could be lost.

The ATM-based public carrier switch market is wide open.  Of the
three major central office switch vendors--AT&T, Northern
Telecom, and Siemens Stromberg-Carlson--none has yet to
announce the availability of a full-scale ATM central office switch.
In fact, the nearest thing to an ATM central office switch these days
is Fujitsu's FETEX-150.

Fujitsu never has had a presence in the U.S. central office switch
market, but it has used its early adoption of ATM to leverage the
FETEX-150 into several important broadband trials--including U S
WEST's COMPASS trial, which some believe will help set the
pattern for future Bell company broadband switch purchases.  The
FETEX-150 is also in trials with BellSouth and NYNEX.  A couple
of months back, NYNEX installed a FETEX-150 in its R&D lab,
claiming that it had the "world's first hybrid/ATM fabric."

It seems that almost every telecommunications equipment and
computer company has plans for an ATM product of some kind.
There are lots of plans, but few products.  And, of course, most of
the products are aimed at private networks rather than the public
carriers' networks, which brings us to the final question raised at the
beginning of this article:  What will be the relationship between
ATM equipment in the public network and ATM elements in
private networks?

ATM began as a technology for public networks--the transport
technology for broadband ISDN.  Now, however, it is believed that
ATM will find its first commercial applications in multimedia LANs
and in private network hubs.  The truth is that ATM probably
simultaneously will start to appear in islands in all segments of the
network, with public data carriers accounting for a significant slice
of ATM activity.

But despite all the fuss about ATM and promises of ATM products
and services, the fact is that ATM in any form is still not quite here
as a widely available commercial reality.  That will not happen until
1993.

SPRINT WINS $50,000,000 CONTRACT TO UPGRADE
ENERGY, NASA RESEARCH NETWORKS TO ATM

The Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration have selected Sprint Corp. to provide broadband
communications services needed to upgrade three of their national
research data networks to asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
technology.  Estimated to be worth more than $50,000,000 over the
next five years, the contract makes Sprint the first carrier to provide
wide-area ATM service, DoE said.

Slated for the upgrade are DoE's Energy Sciences Network (ESnet),
and NASA's AEROnet and Science Internet systems.  These
networks provide high-speed, nationwide, and international data
communications to support various open research and educational
programs in energy, aeronautics, space, and earth science.

ATM service will be provided to the ESnet on an "early availability"
basis, while it generally is "not expected to be widely commercially
available before 1994," Sprint said.  The activity is funded under the
federal High-Performance Computing and Communications
Program.  Working with Sprint on the contract is TRW of Redondo
Beach, Calif., which will provide new broadband access switches
developed by its Space Communications Division; Cisco Systems of
Menlo Park, Calif., a manufacturer of network routers; and Digital
Equipment Corp. of Maynard, Mass.

BELLCORE ISSUES ATM/BROADBAND ISDN
GENERIC REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTS FOR COMMENT

Public network deployment of Asynchronous Transfer Mode
(ATM)/broadband integrated service digital network (BISDN)
capabilities came another step closer with Bell Communications
Research's issuance of three technical advisories.  It released
documents on "broadband switching system generic criteria" (TA-
NWT-001110); "broadband ISDN physical interface specifications"
(TA-NWT-001112); and "broadband ISDN transfer protocol generic
criteria" (TA-NWT-001113).

The first document describes the telecommunications switching
system capabilities required, including user and network interfaces,
internetworking, services supported, operations functions, usage
parameter control, and performance.  The second proposes the
generic requirements for the BISDN user-to-network interface and
the network-to-network interface.  And the third provides proposed
generic requirements on how information is carried through the
BISDN network.  It focuses on services provided by each layer of
the protocol, functions performed to provide these services, and
interactions between functions.

The advisories are being circulated for industry comment before
being finalized as Bellcore Technical References, and Bellcore
expects that work will continue into next year.  Steve Walters,
Bellcore's BISDN project manager, said that the advisories "are a
critical step in BISDN deployment in that they contain generic
requirements needed by suppliers so they can build initial BISDN
network equipment."

FRAME RELAY FORUM RATIFIES NETWORK-TO-
NETWORK INTERFACE; SPRINT's TAFFEL IS NEW HEAD OF FORUM

The Frame Relay Forum has ratified a network-to-network interface
(NNI) implementation agreement for permanent virtual circuit
(PVC)-based frame relay networks.  "The effect of this milestone
agreement will be to extend the geographic reach of frame relay
networking by permitting both public-to-public as well as private-to-
public network interconnections," said Alan Taffel, the forum's new
President and Chairman.  Mr. Taffel, Director-product marketing at
Sprint Corp., succeeds Thomas H. Jones, formerly of Netrix Corp.
Mr. Jones recently resigned his forum post when he left Netrix to
become Vice President-marketing for Microdyne Corp., which is not
a member of the forum.

The NNI agreement is based upon a similar user-to-network
interface (UNI) implementation pact approved by the forum earlier
this year.  "The NNI agreement, however, addresses new areas such
as bi-directional procedures for PVC management signaling and
congestion control," the forum noted.  The agreement now will be
forwarded to the Open Systems Interconnection Implementor's
Workshop (OIW), including the OIW's Asian and European arms,
for ratification.  It also will be submitted for inclusion in the
Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile, as was done
previously for the UNI agreement.  According to the Frame Relay
Forum, this approach "is likely to be followed by other industry
forums, such as the ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) Forum."

Meanwhile, the Frame Relay Forum's Technical Committee has
generated draft implementation agreements on multiprotocol
interconnection over frame relay and on switched virtual circuit
frame relay services.  Earlier, a service description for frame relay
multicast was developed.

The forum is a non-profit corporation dedicated to promoting the
acceptance and implementation of frame relay based on national
and international standards.


While the forum is not a standards-making body, its technical
committees provide liaison with the standards bodies.

The forum just established two new chapters--one based in Rennes,
France (for Europe) and one headquartered in New South Wales
(for Australia).  There are plans to form a chapter in Asia.

MFS PRESIDENT SEES FCC's EXPANDED
INTERCONNECTION DECISION
AS `ESSENTIAL BUILDING BLOCK' FOR DISMANTLING
LOCAL TELCO MONOPOLY

(At its open meeting Sept, 17, the FCC took several actions that will
hasten the end of the local exchange monopoly in the U.S.  The
centerpiece of its package of decisions was the adoption of rules
allowing telco competitors and users to physically collocate their
transmission equipment in telco central offices.  The FCC said that
interconnectors and local telcos would be free to negotiate "virtual"
collocation agreements as well.  Telcos were directed to file tariffs
outlining all terms of their special access interconnections, including
charges.  Interconnection for switched transport is being considered
in a separate FCC proceeding.

In an interview at TDR's offices the same week, the head of a
competitive access provider that had urged the FCC to look into the
matter discussed the competitive era emerging.)

While MFS Communications Co., Inc., President Royce J. Holland
did not expect a "perfect" FCC decision on expanded
interconnection with local telco facilities, he views the agency's
recent decision as an "essential building block" for dismantling the
"$90 billion local exchange monopoly."  Mr. Holland, who also is
President and Chief Executive Officer of MFS, Inc., described the
regulatory process as "analog," not "digital"; he explained that
changes in the system are "incremental rather than all at once."

He predicted a "five- to eight- or nine-year" period before the
outstanding major issues would be resolved and the breakup of the
local loop monopoly would occur.  He likened the natural monopoly
or franchise concept to the Berlin Wall, which was built to keep
people in as well as out.  "Modern telecommunications should not
look like the old East Germany," he said.

"We're getting a lot of inquiries today about customized network
solutions throughout metropolitan areas," Mr. Holland said.  "This is
primarily for data transmission, to link workstations and PCs with
mainframes, to link workstations together, for shooting images and
data back and forth across town.  In other words, we're talking
about replacing the automobile as a vehicle for transmission with a
high-speed link.  With interconnection, we can provide that one-stop
shopping to a particular business."


For example, he said, suppose there is a business with its
headquarters in downtown Chicago, a high-speed data center in the
O'Hare airport area, and three regional offices in Evanston, Joliet,
and St. Charles.  Today, MFS would be able to serve only the
headquarters and the data center with its fiber optic network.  But
with interconnection authority, MFS could add the three "remote"
sites.

In other words, the company would be able to interconnect these
sites with the Bell company in the serving wire center for each
location, lease DS1 channel termination circuits from the Bell
company, install its own routers on the customer's premises, and
allow the customer to access the mainframes and work stations
elsewhere, Mr. Holland said.  He promised that the company's MFS
Datanet, Inc., subsidiary soon would begin making announcements
regarding high-speed data projects.

Mr. Holland noted a "changing perception" in the industry, whereby
local telecommunications services "are being regarded as strategic
and tactical weapons for businesses to gain competitive advantages."
Several MFS customers, in fact, are employing "unique" image
processing and other high-speed data applications for services such
as Ethernet and Token-Ring channel extensions, he said.  But he
added that confidentiality agreements prohibit him from disclosing
more details.

He noted that MFS's goal is not to be the "second telephone
company."  Rather, the company's objective is to become the
"leading nationwide provider of voice, data, and video services to
businesses, government, and professional organizations," he said.
He did not see MFS's role as analogous to that of MCI
Telecommunications Corp. vis-a-vis AT&T.  He saw it more like
that of IBM Corp. and Electronic Data Systems in relation to the
industry.  "We're more on the trunk side of the PBX than the line
side," he said, adding that the role of the "second phone company" is
better played by the cable TV industry, which primarily serves
residences rather than businesses.

The authority to interconnect to local exchange carrier (LEC)
facilities means "significantly expanded competition for special
access" services and "LATA-wide ubiquity" in the 14 metropolitan
markets that MFS currently serves, Mr. Holland said.  He noted
that these "first-tier" cities include the nation's 10 largest special
access and private line markets.

But with interconnection authority, MFS could justify expanding its
facilities and even "start looking at second-tier cities" such as
Nashville, Salt Lake City, and Phoenix, Mr. Holland said.  "With
interconnection," he explained, "all of a sudden, you now have
LATA-wide ubiquity.  And now you can actually go out and address
the total market and phase in your network as you get market
share."

Without interconnection, however, only the largest markets will
enjoy the benefits of competition, he said.  "In fact, if you were
starting from scratch in the CAP (competitive access provider)
business today, you'd want to count the number of stock exchanges
in a city.  That probably is directly related to the volume of special
access circuits and local private lines--which is probably as good an
indicator (of market potential) as any," he explained.

Despite the emphasis on large metropolitan areas, MFS has not
divorced itself from what might be called "third-tier" markets served
by small independent telephone companies.

One of MFS's customers is the Minnesota Equal Access Network, a
group of independent telcos that is establishing a network that
"basically bypasses U S WEST," Mr. Holland said.  "What we do on
a city-wide scale, independents are doing on a statewide scale," he
added.

He said that MFS is involved in discussions with a number of
independents--"especially those near metropolitan areas that are
interested in using our services to get downtown."  He explained
that MFS already is providing a certain group of independents with
"diverse fiber routing from their territory" to a certain metro area.
But he said he could not disclose details because the parties
involved were not ready to make an announcement.  He believed
that CAPs and independents are "natural allies" because both have a
"difficult time" dealing with the Bell companies.

Pointing to a Connecticut Research study, Mr. Holland said that
1992 CAP revenues are estimated to be approximately $250,000,000.
MFS is "about half the industry; we're going to do $125,000,000 this
year," he said.  He added that MFS's investment totals $250,000,000-
-"again about half the industry."  The other half of the CAP industry
includes cable TV companies (approximately 40%) and small,
regional CAPs (5%-10%).  Titled "Alternate Local Transport:  A
Total Industry Report," the Connecticut Research study projects
that CAP revenues will reach $1.2 billion by 1995.  Contact Dick
Tomlinson at 203/659-0009.

Mr. Holland said he believes that MFS can maintain its share of the
CAP industry because it has the financial resources, can support
new product development, and has high standards for its own
network.  Following interconnection authority for CAPs, a relatively
rapid resolution of local dial-tone, switched access, interLATA toll,
and number portability issues is likely, he predicted.  By the end of
the decade, he predicted that all of the local exchange market would
be deregulated, competitive access would be a multibillion-dollar
industry, and CAPs would have a 35% share of the market.

FOCUS ON USERS
SURVEY SHOWS USE OF MULTIPLE LANs IS UP 30%,
BUT SPENDING FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS REMAINS
FLAT

While the installation of local area networks has increased
dramatically during the past year, overall spending on
telecommunications has been flat, a survey of nearly 800 North
American business and government telecom users has shown.  The
t
n726
fourth annual survey, conducted by Deloitte & Touche's
Telecommunications Group, revealed that more than 90% of the
respondents' organizations now have multiple LANs installed,
compared to 60% a year ago.

Communications managers cited "network management" as the most
important technical issue they face today.  Networks are expanding,
reflecting the consolidation of separate networks and the merger of
companies into single, large entities.  In addition, single
departments with corporate-wide telecom responsibilities are being
created.

The survey showed that telecom spending as a percentage of
revenue increased from 3% to 7%, depending upon the industry,
but that actual telecom expenditures generally remained constant,
increasing an average of 1.2% in 1991 across all industries.
Telecom spending in the government and financial services sectors
increased the most, 11%.  The manufacturing, services, and retail
industries decreased their telecom spending by an average of 9%.
Operating budgets for telecommunications averaged about 4.5 times
the capital budget across all industries, up from 4 times in 1991.
Salaries and personnel costs, the single largest budget component,
accounted for 27% of operating budgets.  Long distance, leased line,
and local access charges collectively accounted for 45%.  Twice as
many respondents--30%--reported having international responsibility
and coverage as in previous years.

Marco Bonilla, a partner in Deloitte & Touche's telecom practice,
said that "Despite the fact that 39% of the respondents indicated
that they had investigated enterprise-wide network management
products, not one, single enterprise network management system
currently exists among the responding companies."  According to the
survey, 88% of the respondents have one or more network products
and actively manage voice and/or data communications networks.
The most prominent wide-area network products in use are IBM
Netview, Racal-Milgo CMS, System Center Net/Master, and Codex.

A number of key network management issues were highlighted by
respondents.  These include:

The integration of networks and management products that
originally were not designed to work together;

An historical lack of internal company standards regarding
communications equipment;

An increased investment in telecommunications and the
requirement to protect that investment; and a general lack of well-
defined, open international standards on which to build network
management systems.

As for LAN design and operations, the average number of LANs
installed within the surveyed organizations was 48, each with 23
workstations on average.  Mr. Bonilla suggested that "This portends
an increase in the complexity of network services and expertise that
must be provided by the organizations responsible for LAN-related
technology deployment and operations, which may or may not be
the MIS/telecommunications department."

The use of LANs and LAN-based technology is prevalent within
most organizations, but "metrics for evaluating the performance,
availability, responsiveness, and data integrity of LAN-based systems
are informal at best and frequently don't exist at all," Deloitte &
Touche reported.  It said that a "lot of firefighting" has been the
result, and, consequently, companies "are not thinking about
tomorrow."  Yet increased reliance on communications means that
"the cost of service interruptions and degradation will rise as
productivity and revenues decline," Mr. Bonilla stated.  The
implication is that telecom planning and performance measures
must become a management priority in the near future.

While many new technologies have the potential to affect the
directions and strategies for LANs and LAN-based technologies,
survey respondents indicated that the following, in descending order,
will have the greatest impact:

Client/server applications (92%); Electronic image management
(91%); and Wireless LAN technology (73%).

Client/server applications are being used by 33% of the respondents,
though typically not for mission-critical applications yet.  Another
56% reported that they are evaluating the potential benefits of
client/server applications.  Respondents also indicated that such
applications currently make up less than 10% of their organization's
application portfolio (by number of applications).  Glenn James,
who developed the survey for Deloitte & Touche, said that
"Nevertheless, as the lack of internal expertise and mature products
is overcome, client/server applications will become a mainstream
design and delivery mechanism."

Deloitte & Touche said that "High-bandwidth metropolitan and
wide-area networks (greater than T-1) are not yet extensive in any
industry other than financial services (banking and brokerage
services) and education.  However, several industries and individual
companies report that they are investigating or planning such
networks within the next two years.  Products including frame relay,
FDDI, and SMDS are the most likely means of satisfying these
high-bandwidth requirements.

"Application development, particularly as it relates to the LAN and
workstation environment, and LAN-to-LAN communications will
force the implementation of these higher-bandwidth products and
services.  Projected rapid price decreases over the next few years for
some network services and communications hardware will allow
justification of projects that are currently not feasible or that can
only be marginally rationalized."  Contact Mr. Bonilla at Deloitte &
Touche, 285 Peachtree Center Ave., Suite 2000, Atlanta, Ga. 30303.

NETWORK NEWS
MCI TOUTS USE OF SIMPLE NETWORK MANAGEMENT
PROTOCOL FOR FRAME RELAY NETWORK MONITORING

MCI Communications Corp. says it is the first carrier to introduce a
frame relay management system based on a Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP).  MCI's Frame Relay Customer
Network Management (CNM) system collects and displays service
performance and alarm monitoring information on demand.  "With
CNM, customers obtain a variety of network information including
alarms on network equipment, permanent virtual circuits, and access
lines, as well as statistics on frame and byte counts, input and
output errors, and comparable information from MCI-provided
customer premise equipment," MCI said.

The information is provided through a CNM server over MCI's
frame relay network to the customer workstation using standard
SNMP and MCI's Enterprise-Defined Management Information
Base, which defines the information data base available to the
customer, MCI noted.

"Because the information is provided in a standard-compliant
format, customers' existing workstations can be used to process this
information and can be configured to support other network
management elements of their wide-area networks as well as
monitor LAN activity.  This eliminates the need for separate LAN
management systems," it added.

CNM became available Oct. 1 on a limited basis and is planned for
general commercial availability in the first quarter of 1993.

While MCI has not made final decisions on pricing, it noted plans
"to charge standard installation fees based on the level of
installation support required and recurring charges ranging from
approximately $300 to $2000 per month, depending upon the
workstation and network management package selected."  MCI
plans to enhance CNM capabilities for use with its future virtual
private data services, and to incorporate it or similar capabilities
into other MCI data network management products--such as
Integrated Network Management Service--over time, depending on
market demand.

AT&T PLANS TO OFFER INTEGRATED ACCESS
FOR PUBLIC NETWORK ISDN/PRIVATE NETWORK
SERVICES

AT&T has announced a new feature that will allow customers to
access both public switched ISDN (integrated services digital
network) and private network services on a single high-speed T-1
(1.544 megabits per second) facility.  With the new Primary Rate
Interface Static Integrated Network Access (PRI SINA) feature,
"smaller locations that could not justify the cost of separate access
facilities can be more innovative in their use of applications such as
local area network interconnection and videoconferencing," said
Richard Campbell, AT&T's ISDN product manager.

The cost efficiencies of PRI SINA can be enhanced when used with
Call-By-Call service selection, "an additional AT&T ISDN feature
that allows customers to select the switched services to be used on
each access channel on a call-by-call basis," AT&T said.  It also
noted that "Together with intelligent switching multiplexers, such as
the Teleos NetworkHub, PRI SINA can provide even further
efficiencies and cost savings.  The Teleos NetworkHub can allocate
private line overflow onto switched service lines on demand."

A trial of PRI SINA and the Teleos NetworkHub currently is being
conducted by 3M, Teleos Communications, Inc., and AT&T.  Begun
in May, the trial provides switched and private network connections
between three 3M locations in the U.S.  The Teleos NetworkHubs
aggregate traffic onto a single T-1 facility at each location and
allocate individual channels at each location to meet the location's
voice, data, and video needs.  The trial's applications combine
videoconferencing, local area network interconnection, voice
communications, and access to a private X.25 data network.

AT&T emphasized that "Instead of buying more private line
capacity for peak traffic overflow, a company like 3M can save
money by using PRI SINA and the NetworkHub to move peak data
traffic onto public switched network services as needed.  3M also is
able to consolidate several AT&T services onto one highly
manageable high-performance digital access facility."  The trial will
evaluate "operational readiness and key reliability measures" prior to
AT&T making PRI SINA widely available in September.  To use
PRI SINA, customers need an M-24 service function in the AT&T
central office, AT&T noted.  There is a monthly $150 charge for the
function.

NEBRASKA TELCOs, UNIVERSITY, GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES COOPERATE ON FRAME RELAY NETWORK

The Nebraska Telephone Association (NTA) has begun phasing into
service a frame relay data network for the state.  Frame relay
centers already are in operation in Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island,
Norfolk, North Platte, Alliance, and O'Neill.  The Public Service
Commission helped coordinate the project, which required
cooperative efforts by the government, University of Nebraska, and
NTA's 40 local exchange carrier members.  NTA Chairman Norm
Osland said that "An up-to-date telecommunications network is
viewed as critical to the economic development of Nebraska.  We're
pleased that the state is working with the private sector to see that
Nebraska can continue to maintain its leadership position in the
area of telecommunications."

Expected to make early use of the system are the state's Library
Commission, the Department of Education, the University of
Nebraska Medical Center, and local libraries, schools, and hospitals.
Private-sector entities expected to use the service include financial
institutions and multi-location businesses.

TECHNOLOGY
TEST OF LOCAL EXCHANGE/INTEREXCHANGE NETWORK
INTEROPERABILITY FOR ISDN IS SUCCESSFUL

The first interstate call testing MCI Telecommunications Corp.'s
ISDN (integrated services digital network)-capable network and the
access capabilities of two phone companies was completed
successfully.  The test call was initiated from a New Jersey Bell
Telephone Co. switch in Holmdel, N.J., to New York Telephone
Co.'s West Street location in New York City over long distance lines
provided by MCI.

"The trial involved routing and signaling for both voice and data
calls using local switches made by two different manufacturers," Bell
Communications Research reported.  The call, which was part of a
four-phase testing program looking toward introduction of a
nationwide ISDN network this fall, marked the start of testing to
confirm the interoperability of local exchange and interexchange
networks for ISDN transmission and signaling.

Testing is scheduled to begin soon between the Holmdel switch and
BellSouth Telecommunications switches in Atlanta; AT&T's
interexchange network will be used.  The third phase of testing,
which will be ongoing until later this month, will involve calls
between switches in the 20 cities that will be part of the initial
national ISDN network.  In the final phase during October and
November, user-to-user applications will be tested.  Earlier, Bellcore
and manufacturers tested switches and various network components.

RAD NETWORK DEVICES GETS PATENT FOR
`SOURCE ROUTING TRANSPARENT' PROTOCOL

RAD Network Devices, Inc., has been granted a U.S. patent for the
technology that permits the "source routing transparent" (SRT)
algorithm.  SRT is an emerging bridge standard for both FDDI
(fiber distributed data interface) and Token-Ring LANs.  It
simultaneously supports user stations employing the "source routing"
and the "transparent routing" methods, allowing LANs in mixed
environments to communicate with each other regardless of their
bridging schemes.

RAD Network Devices, of Huntington Beach, Calif., explained that
"To network managers and their companies, this results in
tremendous cost savings by eliminating the need for multiple bridges
and separate lines to support the different LAN internetwork
traffic."  The SRT algorithm "allows both the transparent and
source-routing methods to exist within the media access control
(MAC) layer," it added.  "SRT handles both the existing MAC layer
bridging protocols by differentiating between these two methods on
a frame-by-frame basis, as the packet is routed."  The SRT concept
has been adopted by an Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers standards committee, which is in the process of approving
SRT as an addendum to the existing IEEE 802.1D local bridge
standard.

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR, ADAPTIVE CORP.
REACH ATM TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AGREEMENT

National Semiconductor has signed an ATM (asynchronous transfer
mode) technology development agreement with ADAPTIVE Corp,
a majority-owned subsidiary of Network Equipment Technologies,
Inc.  The pact makes National the first LAN semiconductor
company to endorse ATM technology, and the announcement marks
the first in a series of steps in National's strategy to focus on
multimedia computers and high-speed networks.  Under the
agreement, ADAPTIVE's ATM interface technology will be licensed
to form the basis of future chipsets from National.

Charles Carinalli, Chief Technical Officer and Executive VP of
National's Communications and Computing Group, said that "This
is just one of a number of revolutionary networking announcements
that you will see from National over the coming year that cover the
full spectrum of desktop platforms from PCs to workstations.  ATM
is the long-term strategic solution for seamless global networking.
We see it as a perfect complement to our multimedia enhancement
strategies for Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI" (fiber distributed
data interface).

The companies explained that "The appeal of ATM to the LAN
industry is based on the premise that today's data-only networks are
becoming congested and increasingly difficult to design, administer,
and manage.  ATM allows the construction of very high-
performance/capacity workgroups and backbones that will reduce
these problems and support emerging multimedia applications."

BELLCORE OFFERING TECHNICAL AUDITING
SERVICES DIRECTLY TO EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS

Bell Communications Research has started offering technical
auditing services directly to suppliers of network and end-user
equipment for SMDS (switched multimegabit data service) and
frame relay PVC (permanent virtual circuit) services.  In the past,
Bellcore generally conducted technical analyses of a supplier's
products only at the request of its Bell company owners.

Michael Koblentz, Bellcore's Director-data communications
technical analysis, said that "The successful widespread deployment
of both frame relay and SMDS services--and their ultimate
usefulness to customers--depends heavily on multi-vendor
interoperability and equipment conformance to service
requirements.  This analysis, provided directly to suppliers, can help
speed this deployment, facilitating the ongoing migration from
private data networks to public data networks."

For both frame relay and Bellcore tests and SMDS, Bellcore tests
a vendor's product for compliance
For both frame relay and SMDS, Bellcore tests a vendor's product
for compliance with industry standards or Bellcore's generic
requirements.  The analysis covers traffic and protocol conformance
testing across the interface between a customer's equipment and the
telecom network.  Testing is accomplished using Bellcore-developed
systems that simulate multiple end users.  Bellcore pointed out that
although its technical audit "provides an objective analysis of a
product, it does not imply Bellcore's approval, certification,
recommendation, or endorsement."  More information is available
from Mr. Koblentz at 908/758-3086.
