		<P><B>Cuiu-Cuiu, Brazil</B>
<P>The Cuiu-Cuiu project is located in the state of Para in northern Brazil, in the centre of the Tapajos gold province, the country’s oldest and largest gold producing area. The 25,000-hectare property is underlain by granites which are being investigated for their potential to host large volume, low grade gold deposits in hydrothermally altered stockwork zones as well as disseminated gold deposits in granite and tectonic breccias. Initial sampling and auger drilling have identified anomalous areas in saprolite material varying from 20 to 80 metres in width and with a strike extension of at least 1,500 metres. Drilling will be carried out in 1996 to test the property further.
		<P><B>Gurupi, Brazil</B>
<P>The Gurupi project, a 50/50 joint venture between TVX Gold and Santa Fe Pacific Gold, is located 350 kilometres southeast of the city of Belem along the Gurupi River. The 49,400-hectare property covers a 20-kilometre length of the 2-kilometre wide Gurupi shear belt. Gold is contained in metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks in two intensely mineralized parallel trends cut by shear and stockwork zones and quartz veins. Drilling to date has identified gold-bearing zones in saprolite and bedrock up to 2.5 kilometres in length and 15 to 60 metres thick with grades of about one gram of gold per tonne, and the potential for a reserve of over one million ounces. With four drills on the property, 20,000 metres of drilling in 200 holes is planned for 1996.
		<P><B>Volta Grande, Brazil</B>
<P>The Volta Grande project is located on the Xingu River, in the Amazon Basin, approximately 460 kilometres southwest of the city of Belem. The 15,100-hectare property lies in the famous Carajas mineral province associated with the Palmeiras greenstone belt. Its primary gold occurrences have been the target of garimpeiro activity. Preliminary exploration has identified three major targets on which drilling will be carried out in 1996 to investigate their potential for both low grade open pit and high grade underground mining operations.
		<P><B>Quimsacocha, Ecuador</B>
<P>TVX Gold has a 33% interest in the Quimsacocha project, a joint venture with Cogema and Newmont Overseas Explorations Limited. Located in the Azuay Province of south-central Ecuador, southwest of the city of Cuenca, the project covers a total of 12,250 hectares. Geological studies and geochemical and geophysical surveys have already identified six areas with anomalous gold-silver-copper values which will be tested for their bulk tonnage potential. A 28-hole, 3,120 metre drill program will be initiated in the first half of 1996.
		<P><B>Collon, Peru</B>
<P>The 12,000-hectare Collon project is located in central Peru, 17 kilometres north of the city of Huaraz in an area with excellent access and infrastructure. Initial drilling of a large gold-silver anomaly has yielded encouraging results, identifying mineralization in skarn and porphyry associated with a thrust fault around 25 metres thick. Future plans are to finish the first phase of drilling, for a total 1,400 metres, carry out a further 6,000 metres as a second drilling phase and continue exploration and trenching. The property is underlain by Cretaceous sediments intruded by Tertiary intrusives.
