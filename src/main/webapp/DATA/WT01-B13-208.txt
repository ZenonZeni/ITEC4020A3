<BR>

Depending on your tax bracket, you may be better off - and enjoy a yield
advantage - in an investment that is exempt from federal income taxes.
<BR><BR>

The primary intention of tax-exempt investments is to generate income
that is not subject to federal income taxes. (Income may be subject to
state and local taxes, and a portion of income may be subject to the
alternative minimum tax for certain investors.)
<BR><BR>

When you consider the federal taxes you would owe on the income you receive
from a taxable investment, you may find that you will retain more income
with a tax-exempt investment. In general, the higher your tax bracket,
the more advantageous a tax-exempt investment can be - as you will note in
the tables below. (Both tables are based on 1996 federal rates.)<BR>

<FONT SIZE=-1>*This table assumes a decrease of $3.75 of itemized deductions for each $100
of adjusted gross income over $117,950. For a married couple with adjusted
gross income between $176,950 and $299,450 (single between $117,950 and
$240,450), add 0.7% to the above marginal federal tax rate for each personal and dependency
exemption. The taxable equivalent yield is the tax-exempt yield divided
by 100% minus the adjusted tax rate. For example: if the table tax rate is
37.1% and you are married with no dependents, the adjusted tax rate is
38.5% (37.1% + 0.7%+0.7%). For a tax-exempt yield of 6%, the taxable
equivalent yield is about 9.76% (6% &#247; (100%-38.5%).
<BR><BR></FONT SIZE=-1>

As shown in the tables, you would have to earn significantly higher yields
on a
taxable investment to offset the effect of the federal tax you would owe
on
your income. You would not be liable to pay federal income tax on the
 interest dividend income
you receive from the tax-exempt investment. However, for all tax exempt 
mutual funds, distribution of capital gains are considered taxable
 income to the shareholder. Please remember that
a portion of the interest dividend may be considered a tax preference 
item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. (Of course, the yields in
the
tables are for purposes of illustration only and do not reflect the
yield of
a specific investment.)
<BR><BR>

Even though most investors prefer to avoid taxes, the tax advantage and
lower tax-exempt yields available from tax-exempt investments are not
the
best choice for all investors. For your own circumstances, be sure to
work
through the calculations shown above or consult your financial
representative.
<BR><BR>

Investors are required to disclose on their federal income tax returns
the
amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year. In addition,
individuals whose modified income, which includes adjusted gross income,
tax-exempt interest and 50 percent of their Social Security benefits,
exceeds a base amount will be subject to federal income tax on as much
as 85
percent of their Social Security benefits.
