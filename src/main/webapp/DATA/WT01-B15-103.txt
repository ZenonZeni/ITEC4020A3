James O'Shaunessy's upcoming book <i>"What Works on Wall Street</i>" studies the long-term performance of 60 different investment strategies. O'Shaunessy seems to believe that <i>discipline</i> is the key to investing. Almost two thirds of the tested strategies beat the S&P 500's 40 year average return of 11%. The best strategy looked for stocks valued above $150 million, stocks with 5 years worth of earnings growth and stocks with a price to sales ratio under 1.5. Finally, from the remaining companies, the 50 stocks showing the strongest price growth (relative strength) for the past year were picked. This strategy would have gleaned a very handsome annual average return of 18.2% over the past 40 years.<p>For those of you who like the Baby Boomer Demographics story, a new book from David Foot (with Daniel Stoffman) called "<i>Boom, Bust and Echo-how to profit from the Coming</i> <i>Demographic Shift</i>". Professor Foot, a U. Of Toronto economist/demographer is a leading practitioner of demographics and economics and has produced a very lucid and readable book. With the assistance of Daniel Stoffman we get to read about the Real Estate Meltdown, how demographics explains the real estate boom of the 70's and 80's and why things will be very different over the next decade. Corporations and the nature of work will change. Why retailers selling quality and service will beat out the low price merchants. How will our leisure time change? Will boomers still ski-as they age and their muscles stiffen? Gardening could be the next Cool Leisure Activity!! What are Canada's health trends? How will our family life change as most of us get older?<p>A couple of months ago, I moaned and groaned about the investment and financial planning industry's fixation with the Baby Boom and the science of demographics. My problem with demographics is that widely held knowledge is discounted by the markets, because investors buy in anticipation of future events. Investing with a ten to twenty year horizon is really difficult. Many investment Pro's. have difficulty projecting any further than one year ahead. Fashion and habits change too. Remember the polyester leisure suit of twenty years ago. It should have been a big winner. That said, there is much in Foot's approach that will help you explain and anticipate changes in your life and surroundings-it's well worth your time to read his book. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>There are no<br>charts related<br>to this article.</font><p></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="mutual.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="us.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font></center></body></html>
