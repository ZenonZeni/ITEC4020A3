-RETAILERS MAY LEVY CREDIT CARD USERS

CARD SYSTEMS- RETAILERS MAY LEVY CREDIT CARD USERS
(C) 1994 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Netherlands: Following a move by the Dutch  Ministry
of Economic Affairs, Dutch retailers now have the
option of levying a surcharge on credit card
purchases or offering a discount to customers using
cash or other rival forms of payment. The ministry
said that the lifting of the ban on discrimination by
retailers between forms of payment, would affect
American Express, Eurocard, VSB International, part
of Dutch-Belgian Fortis and Diners Club Benelux.
Dutch shopkeepers currently pay around a five percent
commission to credit card companies.

The idea is to is to stimulate customers to use
cheaper forms of payment such as cash transactions
and automatic transfers.

The Netherlands' small businesses' federation, KNOV,
and consumer association, Consumentenbond, anticipate
that retailers will be able to curtail use of credit
cards through publicity campaigns and by refusing
this form of payment.  The hope is that credit card
issuers will reduce rates since credit cards will now
have to compete more openly with other payment
methods.

There are around three million credit card users in
the Netherlands(10 percent of the population)
accounting for DFl 6bn in turnover and 30 million
transactions a year. Retailers pay around DFl 300m a
year in commissions.

It is interesting to note that similar moves which
were brought into force in the UK some years ago have
had little impact and few retailers seem to have
taken up the option of charging for card transactions
or offering discounts for cash.

-SPECIAL SCREEN PHONES FOR HOME BANKING TRIAL

CARD SYSTEMS- SPECIAL SCREEN PHONES FOR HOME BANKING
TRIAL
(C) 1994 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

USA: Visa International, Crestar Bank and US Order
have signed an agreement to pilot screen phone
technology for home banking, shopping, and
information services. The program began this month
and will run approximately one year.  About 400
Crestar customers from the greater Washington, D.C.,
metropolitan area who hold a Crestar Premier
MoneyCard (a Visa check card) will participate.
Users will require a special telephone with a display
screen and magnetic stripe card reader. To use the
system, a card is first swiped through the reader and
the user enters a PIN to gain access to the system.
Consumers participating in the test will use leased
US Order ScanFones containing specialized bill
payment software.  The software supports bill
payment, reads the Crestar/Visa card information,
encrypts the PIN, and transmits the bill pay session
to US Order for processing.  VisaNet is used to
obtain PIN verification from Crestar Bank, as well as
to route the payment request to Crestar for
authorization on the payment date specified by the
consumer. Finally, US Order sends the consumer's
payment directly to the biller, using the US Order
BankPlus host bill processing system.
