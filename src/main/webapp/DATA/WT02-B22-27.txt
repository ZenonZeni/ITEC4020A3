<DD>Zoe Baird, Jennifer Flowers, Vince Foster, Paula Jones, Whitewater, Travel
Gate.  What is the common denominator?  These names and events are but a
small sampling of the tools used by some Republicans to insure against a
second term in office for President Bill Clinton.  In the event they fail
to accomplish this goal, here is an early (May, 1996) explanation. <P>

<DD>Led by Speaker Gingrich and talk radio and TV host Rush Limbaugh, 
Republicans launched the nastiest, most vindictive personal attack upon an
American President in memory.  Not even the anti-Richard Nixon crowd of
the 1970s descended to the level of disrespect, derision and incivility
directed at President Clinton.  Though Clinton is a sitting President,
he has been cast in the role of underdog. <P>

<DD>Recent polls indicate that this negative line of attack is no longer
working and Republicans, frustrated, are targeting members of their own
party.  Watch for another "character" discussion.  It won't play as well as
it did previously.  Instead of responding in anger, Clinton has busied
himself with affairs of state, growing in stature, showing a strength of
character that even his most ardent supporters wouldn't have believed. <P>

<DD>Traditionally, Americans have shown a sense of fair play and have rallied
to support the underdog.  They forgive their public figures' human
frailties as they forgave Richard Nixon's, providing these figures
perform in their field of endeavor.  Bill Clinton has performed, and the
Republicans have only themselves to blame for their failure to understand
American human nature.  <P>
