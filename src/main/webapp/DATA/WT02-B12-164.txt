Implementing Welfare Changes</h2>

<ul>


<p>

On November 27, 1996, the New York Times reported that the Clinton

administration was proposing changes in the August 1996 welfare law that would

cost about $13 billion of the $55 billion expected to be saved over six years.

Among the changes under discussion is making legal immigrants eligible for Food

Stamps.  Immigrant advocacy groups want the Clinton administration to return to

the previous system, so that legal immigrants participate in Food Stamps on the

same basis as US citizens.<p>

The Congressional Budget Office says that one million immigrants may lose

Food Stamps under the welfare law as approved in August 1996 and that it would

cost roughly $3.7 billion over six  years to restore their eligibility.<p>

The Clinton administration is implementing the new welfare law in a manner

that some in Congress say is unlawful.  The law permits legal immigrants to

receive Food Stamps after 40 quarters of US work.  The USDA is reportedly

permitting legal immigrant couples to combine their work quarters and, if the

couple has 40 quarters of US work, they are deemed eligible for Food Stamps.

<p>

Other reports say that, if an applicant for Food Stamps asserts that he has

worked 40 quarters in the US, he is granted Food Stamps.  There is not yet a

quick way for Food Stamp officials to check on applicant work

experience.<p>

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that up to 500,000 legal

immigrants could lose Supplemental Security Income payments under the new

welfare law.  A report from Massachusetts, where SSI payments average $500 per

month, says that retirement homes have organized English and civics classes to

help immigrants to naturalize.  Persons over 50 and in the US more than 15

years are allowed to take the test in their native language.<p>

Since 1979, Special Order 40 in Los Angeles has prohibited city employees,

including the Los Angeles Police Department, from reporting suspected illegal

aliens to the INS.  The policy prevents officers from asking anyone about their

immigration status, checking with the INS or turning suspects accused of minor

violations over to INS officials.<p>

However, several city council members want to change the policy in order to

deal with the violent 18th Street Gang.  As many as 60 percent of the estimated

20,000 18th Streeters in Southern California are illegal immigrants.<p>

The new welfare law requires state and local government agencies to report

suspected illegal immigrants to the Immigration and Naturalization Service

every three months.   <p>

Los Angeles-area police agencies say that many illegal immigrant suspects

flee to Mexico to avoid apprehension and that some of the worst criminals drift

back and forth between Southern California and Mexico, heading south for refuge

and are then being drawn back by the possibility of criminal profit. <p>

Beginning November 30, 1996 foreign exchange students on F-1 visas must pay

public school districts the full cost of their education before they can enter

the US, and they can remain in the US only 12 months.  Some Asian parents sent

their children-- parachute kids-- to US relatives to attend US high schools to

improve their chances of getting into the best US universities.  One 1990

estimate was that there were 40,000 parachute kids from Taiwan aged eight to 18

were living in the United States.<p>

The US State Department issues 400,000 F-I visas per year, most for

college-age students.<p>

Foreign students who attend elementary or adult schools without paying

tuition can be barred from the US for five years.<p>

<u>California.</u>  A California court on November 26, 1996 prohibited

California from declaring pregnant illegal alien women ineligible for

state-funded prenatal care.  California tried to deny benefits to illegal alien

women on December 1, 1996 under an emergency rule, but the judge ruled that

there was no emergency.  California will now go through the normal process of

issuing regulations to remove illegal alien women from the program, a process

that takes three to six months.<p>

The new welfare law requires states to get welfare recipients into jobs in

order to receive federal funds.  A study of the one million California adults

receiving AFDC payments found that almost half did not have high school

diplomas and almost half did not have cars or access to reliable

transportation.  One-third have not held a job during the past five years and

11 percent have never worked.<p>

The effort to move these largely unskilled workers into jobs has been

called the greatest challenge facing the state.  Democrats appear to favor a

package of education and training programs to pull recipients into the labor

market, while Republicans favor reducing benefits to push recipients into the

labor market.<p>

In San Francisco, where 35 percent of the residents are foreign-born,

supervisors declared the city a "safe zone" for immigrants and pledged to

encourage naturalization and to provide translation services at city meetings

upon request.  The supervisors pledged not to "discriminate on the basis of a

person's immigration status" in the provision of city services.<p>

<u>Massachusetts.</u>  Massachusetts mails welfare checks to 1,400 poor

illegal immigrant parents to support their US-born, US-citizen children and is

considering whether to turn their names over to the INS as required by law.  An

illegal alien is not eligible for the state's $93 per month adult benefit, but

can receive $486 per month to support two children.  The state assigns illegal

parents fictitious Social Security numbers for tracking purposes.<p>

Critics say that this system makes it impossible to determine if the alien

is earning money and that subsidizing even indirectly illegal immigrants

frustrates immigration controls.  Immigration advocates say that ending privacy

protections for undocumented parents will create hardships for their US-citizen

children.<p>

Massachusetts, as well as other states, are expected to give their lists of

illegal alien parents collecting welfare on behalf of their US citizen children

to the INS, but it is not clear what action, if any, the INS will take.<p>

<u>Florida/Virginia</u>. Florida plans in Spring 1997 to refer welfare

recipients to jobs once held by illegal immigrants, following Virginia's

agreement with the INS in October 1996 to try to fill jobs opened by INS raids

with welfare recipients.  Virginia expects to fill 300 to 400 jobs that pay $7

to $8 per hour in hotels, restaurants and construction but, after two months,

the INS had not yet notified Virginia of any job openings.<p>
