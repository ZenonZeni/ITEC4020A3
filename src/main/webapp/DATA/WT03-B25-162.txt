<P><U>The Automotive Environment</U>
<P>As the world economy moves into a growth phase, the U.S. automotive industry is continuing a restructuring process that will have a major impact on all the participants. The restructuring of the industry revolves around two major factors. The first factor is the competitive requirement to create, produce and deliver quality vehicles more rapidly while using extended enterprise facilities located around the world. The second factor is the global market influence on the industry which is providing new growth markets while at the same time causing production facilities to strain to meet the increased demand. Keeping plants located around the world working in harmony is an added complexity to an already complex industry. The easy use of technology by the line organizations can play a strong role in uniting the design and production process. 

<P>The goal of the supplier in the global enterprise is to fit into the OEM business processes of today, and those in the future, as seamlessly as the internal and domestic plants. But no one can predict the specific changes in the technology or the business processes that will be required by the automotive industry. One approach to the problem is to use technology that can easily adapt to changes in both business practice (in the OEM and global supplier) and 
in technology itself. It is important to build a sound foundation that can balance the goals of the business process, the technology, and the organization.

<P><U>Business Process Goals</U>

<P>An identification of the key business processes that must operate correctly to maintain and improve overall 
operating effectiveness. These business processes will become the focal point for the application of the 
appropriate monitoring or control technology.

<P>An implementation strategy that concentrates both on the specific business purpose to be accomplished and uses 
the transportable technical building blocks (i.e. collect move, manage, analyze and process information). If common 
technical building blocks are used, future applications will have more time to focus on the business function improvement rather than the supporting technology infrastructure. This will, over time, allow future applications to be implemented 20-30 times faster 
than using traditional techniques.

<P><U>Technology Goals:</U>
<P>A global network that allows for the communication of the key automotive information elements, (i.e. geometry, 
image, numbers, words, video/voice) within the supplier organization and between the supplier and the OEM. 
<P>An information model that defines all the information required to monitor the business operation for decision 
making. Experience is that approximately 400-500 elements comprise the information model for most manufacturing plants. This model must be shared between the supplier and the OEM to ensure that a common meaning of the information elements are shared throughout the enterprise. 

<P>A set of easy to use analysis tools that integrate all types of information.

<P><U>Organization Goals</U>

<P>A line organization that owns the responsibility for success, while the technical community provides accurate 
information. The technical group also supports the use of powerful, easy-to-use analysis tools, along with core business process applications (planning, scheduling, administrative etc.).

<P>An empowered organization focused on making improvements to the business. Access to appropriate information can never be allowed to interfere with this process. 

<P>Successful improvements to the business can result only as far as the weakest of the three elements (technology, 
process, organization) allows. Of the three elements, it is the business process requirements that drive the technology and organizational requirements. 

<P><U>The Automotive Business Process</U>

<P>The business functions involved in providing a car to a customer can be divided into five major process components. These components <A HREF="/prod/prod_articles/119609a.html">(Figure 1)</A>consist of:
<UL>
<LI>Product and Manufacturing Engineering
<LI>Centralized activities (Research, Material Scheduling, Marketing, etc.)
<LI>Manufacturing
<LI>Assembly
<LI>Dealers
</UL>
<P>Each of these components is comprised of innumerable elements that all tie together in the overall process of producing a car. The business elements that generate the design and manufacturing process for a new car are represented on the left side of the model. The elements that are involved in producing a car and delivering it to the customer are found on the right side of the chart. To improve the overall automotive process, each of the elements must work in harmony. Very few gains are made if 
one element of the overall process is world class, and the gains of that process can not be passed on through the 
surrounding elements. In the future, the business drivers of the domestic automotive companies will increase the pressure to be:
<UL>
<LI>faster time to market
<LI>improving quality to the customer
<LI>continuously improving the development and production process
<LI>building quality products in an &quot;agile&quot; fashion.
</UL>
<P>As the supplier base becomes more geographically distant, the job of keeping the individual process elements and the people of the extended enterprise in harmony will become much more difficult.

<P><U>Technology in the Automotive Business Process</U>
<P>The role of technology in this environment is to provide an integrated framework that will easily allow all forms of car-related information to flow through all the business elements in the process. Technology alone can solve very few business problems. Business objectives are met when the technology is combined with the appropriate business process, and supported by the appropriate organization. In a global business model where continuous improvement by all the participants is mandatory, the technology framework must be easy to use, multi-lingual, comprehensive in the type of information accessed, and support changes to the business process with no change required to the underlying technology. The net 
result must be an information network that makes the world-wide participants feel as though they are co-located. 

<P><U>Technology Strategy</U>
<P>The process of developing and building a car requires five fundamental types of information:
<UL> 
<LI>Geometry (the mathematical model used to design the car)
<LI>Image (the two dimensional drawings used to describe parts, machines, tools, plant layouts, etc.)
<LI>Numbers (measurement of performance)
<LI>Words (fundamental office communication)
<LI>Multi-media (video and voice information).
</UL>
<P>With respect to computer technology, each of these different types of information require the same types of technical &quot;building blocks&quot; to allow them to be used in the automotive process. 
<P>These building blocks provide the ability to:
<UL>
<LI>Capture Information
<LI>Move Information
<LI>Manage Information
<LI>Access Information
<LI>Process Information
</UL>
<P>The business/technical strategy in the complex global automotive business process that will provide the maximum impact to the business (business process control, empowered people) is to implement information systems with as many common building blocks as possible. This approach provides the greatest flexibility in utilizing whatever &quot;easy-to-use&quot; tools might be available, and provides the greatest flexibility to accommodate changes in the business or the technology.

<P><U>Automotive Business/Technology Strategy</U>
<P>This strategy consists of two major systems process elements. One is the definition of an automotive &quot;Information Model&quot; and the second is to provide a cadre of powerful tools to allow direct access to that information by the line organization. A &quot;roadmap&quot; for the evolutionary implementation of an integrated supplier information network depicting how the five major technologies (Geometry, Image, Numbers, Words, Multi-media) fit together is shown in <A HREF="/prod/prod_articles/119609b.html">Figure 2</A>. The horizontal axis of the figure depicts the major functions of any automotive business (i.e., Engineering, Planning, Administration, Manufacturing Support and Manufacturing). Engineering in this chart represents the functions of Product and Process design along with the Engineering and Engineering data management. The Planning function 
represents the operations analysis functions required to 
understand the business environment and to set direction. Administration represents the functions of Accounting, 
Financial Analysis and Manufacturing Performance analysis. The Manufacturing support function depicts the plant support functions such as Purchasing and Production Control. 

<P>The Manufacturing column represents the operations that actually produce and distribute products. 

<P>The vertical axis of the chart represents the time requirement for performing the business functions. Those activities performed in the upper part of the chart are performed in hours to weeks; those activities in the middle are performed in minutes to hours; and those activities in the lower portion are performed in seconds to minutes. 

<P>The blocks on the chart show where the various types of technologies would typically be found in the automotive 
extended enterprise. The chart depicts two main themes:

<P>No single technology is appropriate for performing all 
the functions required by the automotive extended enterprise. For example, it is appropriate to use a relational data base and powerful end user tools for end user analysis applications in the area of decision support. It is not appropriate, however, to use a relational data base for machine control applications used on the plant floor. Therefore, specific technologies and their different methods of implementation should be used to support different functions in the automotive business.

<P>The integrating element that ties the technology and the business drivers together is the automotive product 
information model. New techniques for identifying what information is important to the business process have become available that now allow many &quot;personalized&quot; capabilities to be implanted. The model provides flexibility to make changes in the business process and provides a vehicle to communicate with common information. It is important to separate the process of providing information from the process of using the information.

<P><U>Organization</U>
<P>Because of the nature of the technology available, most systems used in the automotive industry tended to use the 
methodology associated with the transaction or process control type of application. These systems provided benefit to the automotive enterprise by doing exactly what they were designed to do. Unfortunately, they did not communicate very well with the other application systems, they were not easy to use, and they were not easy to modify. As a result the information that described the operation of the business was owned by the technical community. Access to new information is difficult within the enterprise negating potential improvements that can be gained through the entire workforce. These improvements can be significant because the individuals performing the specific operational processes understand that process 
better than anyone else and are most able to suggest improvements. The operational people comprise the most significant percentage of the workforce so it is 
easier to get 100,000 one-percent improvements than it is to get one 100,000-percent improvement. 

<P>The triangle diagram <A HREF="/prod/prod_articles/119609c.html">(Figure 3)</A> represents the system functions most commonly required by manufacturing systems, 
(i.e. collecting data, modeling the data, end user tools to easily analyze the data, and using the data in planning and scheduling systems). The characteristics of most present-day systems is that they are very good at collecting data and providing that data to the 
planning and scheduling systems. However, present 
systems generally have not used the newer technology available for users to analyze operational information directly. In addition, an information model that enables these tools to be used effectively by the end users does not exist. As a result, most computer technology used in the automotive industry today is not compatible with 
the business drivers that demand the process improvements from a dedicated, empowered workforce. The 
organizational paradigm must be changed to recognize that the development of new systems is a shared responsibility. The line organization is responsible for defining the goals, making the technology expense and timing tradeoffs and making the impact to the business. The technical community is responsible for providing technical approach alternatives, ensuring the accuracy of the data, and building application systems to support repetitive processes. In this new environment new analysis reports are done in minutes by the line organization and product and operating information is shared throughout the supplier and OEM organizations.

<P><U>Summary</U>
<P>In the past, the automotive companies attempted to control the major elements that affected their operations. Many of the factors that play a major role today, however, such as fuel availability, currency fluctuations, and political changes are not controllable. In addition, continuous change will be an inherent part of the global automotive enterprise. As a result the companies with an empowered workforce using highly flexible technology tools will be best positioned to take advantage of the opportunities presented by change. Product information of any form must be easily accessed within each company, and 
move between the OEM and the supplier as if they were the same company.   The technology strategy to accomplish this is to model the information and provide direct easy access to that information. The organizational strategy is for the technical community and the line organizations to work as a team recognizing that the overall goal is operational effectiveness, not individual computer efficiencies. <I>Copyright, IBM Corp., 1996</I>
