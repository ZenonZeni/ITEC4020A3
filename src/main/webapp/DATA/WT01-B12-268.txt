Interest rates come in several different sizes: short, intermediate and
long. They also have different "flavors": the rates that are available
on U.S. Treasury, corporate and municipal securities. Finally, rates
reflect the push and pull of different forces: growth, inflation,
deficits and currency fluctuations.
<P>

The behavior of interest rates is of more than academic interest.
Investors in money market funds and fixed-income funds, for example, own
different types of securities with different maturities. Whether short-
and long-term interest rates move together or apart will determine the
relative performance of these funds.
<P>

First, let's take a look at the various sizes of interest rates.
Short-term rates refer to rates on instruments such as bank loans or
U.S. Treasury bills that are fewer than two years in maturity. Rates on
instruments between two and seven years in maturity are considered
intermediate term; long-term rates are those paid on instruments that
are seven or more years to maturity. Securities with a longer time
exposure have a greater possibility of inflation, recession or default. 
<P>

Interest rates also vary by the flavor of the security. Because they are
often tax-exempt, municipal securities (which are issued by state and
local governments and agencies) tend to offer lower interest rates than
government or corporate securities. Corporate securities are considered
more risky than governments and therefore interest rates on corporates
tend to be higher than those on governments.
<P>

In 1994, a fascinating year for watching interest rates, we saw a divergence in the performance of both different size
and flavor interest rates. Short rates such as the prime rate charged on
bank loans responded as the Federal Reserve Board steadily increased the
rates it charged on the overnight lending of reserves. When the Federal
Reserve raises the rates it charges banks, that affects the returns an
investor can expect on securities.
<P>

Long rates rose along with short rates as long-term (bond) investors
believed that the Fed was raising short rates in response to
expectations of stronger growth and higher inflation. But while short
and intermediate rates tend to be driven by Fed policy, long rates react
to an array of investor expectations - expectations of currency
stability and fiscal deficits as well as of economic growth and
inflation. 
<P>

The difference in factors that determine rates was clearly evident by
the fourth quarter of 1994. The Fed was still raising short rates. But,
by then, long rates had stabilized and even started to decline. Why? The
market expectations that influence long rates had changed. Financial
markets started to expect that economic growth would slow and inflation
would not rise. Short rates, on the other hand, continued to react to
the Fed's actions.
<P>

Interest rate flavors acted differently as well. Rates on corporate
securities, in particular, did not rise as much Treasuries. Corporate
credit quality was expected to improve as the economy looked stronger
and therefore the traditional difference between what an investor might
earn on a corporate versus a Treasury security narrowed even as interest
rates, in general, rose. Municipal rates, meanwhile, reflected the
relative supply/demand of their own market more than the overall shift
of economic expectations.
