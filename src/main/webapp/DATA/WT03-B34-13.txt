BENEFITING FROM IT: A GUIDE FOR PUCS AND UTILITIES

Technology, and the competitive markets made possible by technology, have
radically reshaped the public utility industry and its regulation. One set
of technologies with the potential to help utilities remain financially
viable in competitive markets--as well as help utilities and regulators
better serve the public--is information technologies (IT).
   Typically, utilities focus on reducing costs as a primary means of
competing with rivals. Unfortunately, the ability to become the low-cost
provider is affected by many irreversible investment decisions made during
less-competitive times. As a result, most utilities will need to make new
investments that better position the company to provide competitive
services that are valued by customers. Investment in information systems
and IT is one strategy that allows utilities to better identify and track
potential customers and their needs and to provide many new services
specifically tailored to customer needs.
   In order to make optimal use of information, utilities and regulatory
commissions will need to make the transition to being information-based
organizations (IBOs). IBOs recognize that, although they produce a tangible
product--utility service--the most important product of the organization is
information. Furthermore, IBOs are ``flatter'' than traditional
organizations. Rather than a corporate management structure that is bloated
at the top, such enterprises:
   -- Rely on the expertise of those who create new information and
knowledge.
   -- Employ task-focused teams as the basic unit of work.
   -- Transform data into useful information.
   Together these tactics allow informed decisions to replace opinions.
Through the skillful use of information, IBOs identify the needs of those
they serve, adapt their work and organization to the optimal service of
their customers, and generate a fair return for their shareholders.

The transition
   Making the transition to an IBO is a challenge. It requires building
powerful and flexible information systems that can bring internal and
external sources of information together into a system with graphics,
analytic, modeling, and communications capabilities. It requires a careful
evaluation of information requirements, effective system-development
strategies, and thorough cost/benefit analyses.
   Cost/benefit analyses of information systems need to take into
consideration the strategic benefits of information systems because those
systems may be used to attract new customers, to support customer-specific
programs and services, and to develop a better understanding of a
competitor's capabilities. Indeed, labor savings typically account for only
30 to 40% of projected system benefits. The recommended steps of
information-system cost/benefit analysis are (1) determine baseline costs;
(2) develop a strategic implementation plan; (3) determine benefits; (4)
compare costs and benefits; and (5) perform sensitivity analysis and risk
assessment.

Where?
   Because geography is such an important part of an electric, natural-gas,
telecommunications, or water utility's service-delivery system, geographic
information systems (GIS)--which encompass transmission and distribution
facilities--are used by many utilities and are being planned by many
others. One estimate is that utilities may invest as much as $48-billion in
GIS technology and data in the next decade.
   Public utility commissions (PUCs) are also investing in GIS. As a
result, GIS is a key IT tool, with the capability to assist utilities and
regulatory commissions in their transitions to IBOs. GIS has replaced paper
maps and records at some utilities and PUCs and is now being used to
provide those entities with strategic advantages.
   Among the important trends driving the need and specific planning for
the use of information systems are downsizing, the rise of outsourcing,
safety and regulatory compliance issues, environmental impacts, new
competition and competitive alternatives, deregulation, and
re-engineering.
   Re-engineering focuses on the outcome of work processes as opposed to
total quality management, which focuses on the processes themselves.
Information systems can support the efforts necessary to fundamentally
redesign business processes and support strategic business decisions.

Justification to the PUC
   Under traditional, rate-base/rate-of-return regulation, there are three
options for the regulatory treatment of information-system investments:
expensing costs immediately, amortizing them over a longer period, or
including them in the rate base. Other issues include determination of the
prudency of information system investments, establishing the appropriate
depreciable life, and the allocation of costs and benefits between
regulated and unregulated business segments.
   Under incentive regulation and price-cap forms of regulation, the
regulatory treatment of utility information-system investments will only be
initially important as regulators set baseline rates or price caps. It will
be difficult for regulators to separate the benefits of information systems
into those that serve the interests of captive ratepayers and those that
position the utility to compete in new environments.
   Therefore, the most significant challenges for utilities and regulators
will not be to find new ways to use information to benefit
consumers--opportunities to use information to benefit customers are
virtually endless. The challenges will be funding, designing, and building
effective systems, performing adequate cost/benefit analyses, and
convincing others that there will be long-term payoffs for many
information-system investments.

WHY USE FUTURES CONTRACTS?

By:
Preston D. Head

   Futures contracts and risk management are quickly becoming as much a
part of the electric power business as gas turbines and alternating
current. Accordingly, to understand where the industry is headed, it is
important to understand how these financial tools work.
   Although the explanations presented here will primarily deal with
futures contracts (see box), risk management as it applies to
exchange-traded options and over-the-counter (OTC) transactions will also
be covered.
   Each of these financial tools--futures contracts, exchange traded
options, and OTC transactions, collectively referred to as derivatives, has
specific characteristics and applications, and together they can provide
tremendous flexibility. Essentially, they give participants in the
marketplace the capacity to affect the outcome of risk exposures they may
have.

Setting sail
   In a competitive, free-market environment, a firm must either accept the
risks to which it is exposed or make a conscious effort to deal with them.
Those that optimize their risks in the marketplace win. Therefore, the
primary message is design and build your ``risk-management'' ship well.
Find, train, and continuously tune the best crew you can--as well as you
can. This is not a one-time crossing or a protected cove. The electricity
industry is embarking on a competition in the open seas. The weather and
conditions will be forever changing and sometimes unexpectedly. Therefore,
managing risks will be a constant necessity, and companies must learn to
embrace futures and other derivatives because their use within the electric
power industry will increase unless deregulation is reversed.
   Why use futures? Because futures can play many valuable roles--such as
addressing price volatility, facilitating price discovery, enhancing
marketing flexibility, and providing transactional safety and anonymity.

Profiting from volatility
   As natural gas made the transition to market-based pricing through
deregulation, that market became more efficient internally, but price
volatility increased. The ability to mitigate--or even better--to profit
from price volatility, is an important aspect of futures.
   Natural-gas prices have been among the most volatile of global
commodities. Consequently, the natural-gas futures contract has been one of
the fastest growing futures markets in the world. By the third year of
trading, in 1992, over 2-million natural-gas futures contracts were traded.
Over 6-million contracts were traded in 1995, representing a national
transaction value exceeding $100-billion. In fact, the New York Mercantile
Exchange (Nymex) seat prices have more than doubled during this same time
period to over $400,000 today. This seems to provide testimony recognizing
the value of these markets.
   So, who is watching over these dynamic transactions? Ultimately, futures
contracts are governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
Futures exchanges represent a well-capitalized clearing system, enforcing
strict compliance and operational standards to ensure fair and orderly
markets. These exchanges are backed by some of the most significant
financial institutions in the world. Thus, when firms use futures as a
means to buy or sell a commodity--such as electricity--they can feel
comfortable with their counterparty.
   Also, the public forum of futures exchanges provides for efficient price
dissemination. The liquidity and transparency it provides establish futures
exchanges as ideal pricing benchmarks for portfolio managers, industry
regulators (performance-based ratemaking), and as a reference for other
commercial contracts.

Delivery schedule
   A small percentage of traded futures contracts result in actual
delivery. However, there are various futures contract delivery mechanisms
that provide commercial flexibility among participants. In the case of
Nymex futures contracts, a firm may stand for delivery by ``standard
delivery procedure,'' ``alternative delivery procedure'' (ADP), or
``exchange for physical procedure'' (EFP). The most widely used among
commercial participants is the EFP.
   Essentially, two entities with opposite futures positions may enter into
an EFP. Mutual offset of their opposite positions involves an agreement for
delivery of an actual commodity that does not necessarily conform to
contract specifications in all terms. Firms use EFPs to offset their
futures contracts, thereby gaining the ability to select their own mutually
agreed upon delivery location.
   Participants may preselect their counterparty, price the transaction at
any level, and eliminate futures execution risk. For example, two firms
desiring to trade a given quantity of electric power under given terms--but
without pre-agreement on price--may index the transaction to the futures
contract. Each firm manifests its separate belief on price by the timing of
its entry into its respective, but eventually offsetting, futures position.
The required cash or physical commodity moves as needed, with each firm
independently determining its own net price.
   In the oil and gas industries, many firms conduct a substantial portion
of their commercial trading activity by using EFPs, often each month, with
the same counterparties. Simply put, futures contracts change the method of
pricing among parties, greatly increasing flexibility.

Hedging, to start
   Risk management is often used interchangeably with the term ``hedging.''
And although risk management covers other areas, hedging is a start.
Hedging (a position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to a
position at risk in the cash market) allows commercial participants to
shift unwanted risks to other market participants with inverse risk
profiles. If you do not hedge, you accept total price risk.
   Hedging is rarely, if ever, a pure science. One of the most important
concepts in hedging may be understanding ``basis.'' Basis (cash
price-futures price) is the relationship between the price of the cash
position being hedged and the futures contract price. If a futures is being
used to hedge an exposure other than one with terms identical to the
futures contract, the basis will fluctuate.
   In addition, there is basis risk, which is an undesired change in the
basis. Professional hedgers consciously weigh outright risk vs basis risk.
And, delivery causes the basis to disappear as cash and futures prices
converge at the expiration of the futures contract. Therefore, hedging is
used by commercial participants to protect:
   -- Prices and costs (fuels, power, inventory, base load.
   -- Margins.
   In the broader context, risk management may:
   -- Provide a competitive advantage.
   -- Afford more confident budgeting and planning.
   -- Allow monetization of poorly performing assets.
   -- Temper earnings volatility.
   -- Focus corporate strategy.
   -- Enhance a firm's ability to borrow.

What to ask
   Preparing for the new competitive environment means analyzing a firm's
exposures to risks. What are the risks, how do they fluctuate, which
risk-management tools are appropriate? What is the corporate objective and
what is the level of sensitivity to risk? Coordinate with knowledgeable
accountants, auditors, attorneys, and brokers. Develop meticulous
procedures and controls incorporating highest levels of management and
oversight groups. Make sure that futures, derivatives, and cash market
transactions are viewed in the aggregate when assessing results. Other
industries have embraced futures markets for decades. The electric power
industry has an ideal opportunity to benefit from those industries sailing
the seas before it.

What is a futures contract?
   A futures contract is a firm commitment to deliver or to receive a
specified quantity and grade of a commodity at a specific location within a
designated month. Typically, there are simultaneous offerings for trading
of successive delivery months, prices are not predetermined, and there are
obligations governing financial performance--with penalties levied for
non-performance.
   For example, the proposed New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex),
California Oregon Border and Palo Verde Switchyard futures contracts call
for 736 MW of firm energy to be delivered during on-peak hours (16 hours
from 07:00 to 22:00), at a rate of 2 MW, over 23 delivery days (Monday
through Friday with makeup on Saturdays and Sundays if necessary), with a
minimum price fluctuation of $0.01/MW ($7.36/contract).
   Successful futures contracts reflect terms and conditions consistent
with cash market practices. The Nymex contracts reflect careful
collaboration with the electric power industry.
   The possibility to actually make or receive delivery, in the case of the
proposed contracts, serves to precipitate convergence between futures and
physical prices as a futures contract approaches expiration.
   To establish the viability of a futures contract, futures exchanges look
to the commercial importance of a commodity, uniformity of product, an
efficient cash or physical market, an efficient way to deliver the product
(bulk transmission market), a large number of buyers and sellers, and a
market that needs price transparency and risk management--in other words, a
price-driven market.

THE CHANGING WORLD OF UTILITY INVESTOR RELATIONS

By:
Jeffrey D. Bogart

   A New York utility considers how to explain its proposed unbundling
program to investors. A diversified utility holding company fields
questions from traditional investors trying to understand its oil and gas
exploration and production business; a West Coast utility appoints its
first full-time investor relations manager to communicate actively with
major investors and explain its growth strategy.
   Deregulation is posing new and intensified investor relations (IR)
challenges for utility companies--which are putting IR executives on the
front lines of the competitive battlefield. How well utility companies
succeed in their fight for funds and for reduced financing costs may well
depend upon their ability to upgrade their IR programs. That won't be
simple. With retail wheeling increasingly certain, mergers and
diversification on the rise, and unbundling more than a possibility,
investors are seeking new information for use in evaluating utility company
stocks. Meanwhile, some utility companies without active IR programs are
taking steps to increase investor appreciation for their business
strategies--and the quality of their management. Still others are seeking
to attract non-traditional utility investors, interested in more than
dividend yield.
   As Laura Mountcastle, vice president of investor relations at CMS Energy
Corp, notes, ``Utility-company investor relations is more demanding than
ever.''
   ``And certainly different,'' adds W. Scott Dudley Jr, IR manager at FPL
Group Inc.
   Security analysts, for example, are digging for data that did not
interest them five or 10 years ago. Witness Edward J. Tirello Jr, who
covers utility companies for NatWest Securities, New York, NY. ``I'm
seeking information from companies about market share and competitive
position--but then, everyone is.''
   Underscoring the industry's reformation, Tirello observes the novelty of
the information that attracts him: ``What mattered before doesn't matter
now,'' he says. ``Before, you were very concerned about regulation, whether
the utility got its rate case, and what its kilowatt-hour-sales growth
potential was.'' Now, ``What I am looking for is almost what you would look
for in a manufacturing company,'' he explains. ``That wasn't the case 10
years ago; you didn't care about those factors. A utility was a regulated
monopoly, and those factors didn't matter.''

Mining for information
   So what are analysts looking for these days? They are much more focused
on industrial customers than they have been in the past, because that is
the group that has the market power right now, asserts Allan J. Stewart, IR
manager at Duke Power Co. ``Analysts are seeking to determine how
susceptible we are to customers selecting some other type of energy
supplier.''
   At Oppenheimer & Co, New York, NY, utility analyst Craig Lucas agrees:
``We need more information in terms of industrial load,'' he says. ``We
need more in terms of customer mix and the prices being charged each
consumer group.''
Cost reduction is another concern for analysts. There is a tremendous
emphasis on busbar costs, or all-in generating costs, instead of the more
traditional questions about rates of return, says Jeffrey Kotkin, Northeast
Utilities' IR manager. ``The lower your costs, the easier it is to sell
your power''--thus, the easier it may be to attract investors.

The shock of open access
   ``In the stock market, low-cost producers carry a premium to the
industry as a whole,'' observes Tirello. Higher margins, after all, do
affect the bottom line. They also influence an analyst's interpretation of
a company's ability to stand the shock of open access. ``Assume, for
example, that in the year 2003, there is direct access and no more
stranded-investment recovery,'' says Oppenheimer's Lucas. ``Then, the
utilities that are able to get their cost profiles in shape in the seven
years from now until then will be the strongest utilities. Right now,
electric utilities trade at from eight to 15 times earnings, a function of
a competitive position. Are you going to pay the same amount for a company
whose costs are higher than another company's, assuming the earnings are
the same?''
   IR officers also are encountering more questions and providing more
information about their companies' unregulated operations. For instance,
Duke Power's Stewart comments that as the regulated electric power business
matures, analysts are asking whether unregulated, diversified operations
will enable utilities to maintain the earnings growth that will translate
into continued dividend growth.
   The challenge for the IR executive is to disseminate the new information
in a way that helps analysts and others understand and value the
unregulated businesses. That means that in some cases, the traditional
electric-utility analysts will need additional education about unregulated
energy businesses. For example, many people following CMS Energy Corp do
not have a good feel for the oil and gas business, says Mountcastle.

M&A quiz
   Utility IR officers are also fielding questions about their companies'
plans to acquire or be acquired, stimulated by the industry's stream of
mergers. ``When the industry's consolidation finishes, there will be 20 to
50 companies left, down from 125 to 150 today,'' suggests Tirello, perhaps
the first among analysts to predict that mergers would occur (``I was the
earliest,'' he claims. ``I was a visionary; everyone else called me
crazy.'')
   Merger information requests can be tricky for IR officers to answer--or
not answer. ``There was a time when I could joke about utility mergers,''
says Stewart, implying no market activity. ``Now I don't say anything. I
don't know about our plans. There are boardroom discussions going on, and I
just don't know what they are. So instead of risking saying that nothing's
happening when it could be, I don't respond to those questions any longer.
There is going to be industry consolidation, and I think we are going to be
involved in it in some form or fashion. I just don't know when or with
whom.''

Close to the vest
   Merger and acquisition information is not the only subject that is
causing utility IR officers pause. Despite analysts' increased need for
information, today's competitive environment is making some companies less
forthcoming about cost information as well. FPL Group Inc, for example, has
stopped filing its Uniform Statistical Report with the Edison Electric
Institute, Washington, DC, because of concern about revealing cost data to
competitors. ``We have always been good information gatherers and
disseminators,'' says FPL's Dudley, ``and in a regulated environment, you
really didn't care who had your information. Today, we are being challenged
to balance the need of the financial community to understand our business
environment with our need to protect our competitive position.''
   Deregulation has also increased the importance of corporate positioning
and corporate credibility in utility IR programs. ``The nature of the
issues and the way you evaluate a company is different,'' says Dudley,
``and our message has changed as well.''
   He adds that companies must find things that are unique about their own
situation, and cautions that the electric power sector is no longer a
homogeneous industry. ``We think we are one of the more uniquely situated
companies,'' says Dudley. ``FPL has a very low exposure, for example, to
industrial customers. We have taken a very aggressive position with regard
to our dividend and our depreciation policy. Taking a marketing-oriented
approach with analysts, Dudley asks Wall Street ``not to treat all
utilities the same; don't analyze us the way you always did, because those
things may no longer work.'''

Not just a regular utility
   As for corporate credibility, it can be key to helping companies bridge
the gap perceived by many investors to exist between the announcement of a
corporate positioning strategy and its accomplishment. Investor skepticism
at corporate pronouncements is evident in a remark by Goldman Sachs' (New
York, NY) Utility Analyst Ernest Liu: ``There's not one company that comes
into a meeting with investors without saying, `We're not just another
regular utility.' The question is just how much you want to believe it.''
   Credibility also comes into play during mergers and in financing
independent power projects. ``Everyone tells you what they do is
non-dilutive,'' says Tirello. ``That's their basic [line]. Sometimes it's
true, sometimes it's not. I take it with a grain of salt.''
   Knowing management well can help analysts gauge the probability that a
company will arrive at its planned destination. As companies unfold their
strategies for doing business in a deregulated environment, says Earl R.
Dunn, IR manager at Puget Sound Power & Light Co, analysts will
increasingly be asking themselves, ``I know these guys; can they pull this
off?''
   For that reason, companies are increasingly inviting analysts and
investors for on-site visits to give them a chance to size up operating
management. Dunn says that in the past, when the business was based on
``cost-plus,'' there was no need for the analyst to go out and ``kick the
tires;'' but today, the analysts are kicking the tires and more than ever
want to understand and know the management.
   These visits differ from the time-honored plant tour. CMS Energy, for
example, conducts almost a full day of presentations with the heads of the
company's different business units, says Mountcastle.
   This enables analysts and investors to see, hear, and actually meet
informally--CMS hosts a dinner the prior night--the people running the
business.

Pounding the pavement
   Besides affecting the substance of investor communications, deregulation
is also stimulating some utilities to expand their interaction with
investors. A New England utility, for example, engages an outside IR firm
to help it target and meet with institutions. Five years ago, Puget Power
did not have anyone handling IR for it, says Dunn. ``We believed that
because utility stocks traded somewhat like bonds, we did not have to get
out there and do anything.'' Is Puget Power doing anything different?
``Yes,'' says Dunn, ``I'm the first in-house investor relations manager
that Puget Power has ever had.''
   The approach is to be more proactive and less reactive, says FPL's
Dudley. In 1994, FPL increased efforts to explain the company's changed
dividend and financial policies. Dudley expects that in 1996, FPL will be
more active than in 1994, when, he estimates, the company's senior
management spent 14 days on the road in company-sponsored meetings in 14
cities with some 80 different investment firms. In 1996, he expects
management's time on the road to increase to as many as 20 days.
   Some diversified companies are seeking to ``target'' and attract
investors interested in more than dividend yield. ``We have been working to
expand the investor base beyond traditional utility investors,'' says CMS
Energy's Mountcastle.
   Both investor and analyst interaction is being made easier by using new
technology. Electronic media offer new avenues of communications. FPL, for
example, plans to launch a site on the Internet within the next few months,
says Dudley. The company, he adds, is also investigating the use of
fax-on-demand and CD-ROM.

Winning ways: A checklist for improving investor relations in a competitive
marketplace
   -- Targeting: Expand the existing base of actual and potential
investors, identifying new categories of potential investors.
   -- Strategy: Build awareness of and appreciation for the company's
approach to survival and growth.
   -- Positioning: Differentiate the company from its industry peers
nationally, regionally, and next door.
   -- Context setting: Identify new benchmarks or criteria against which
to evaluate the company's growth potential and success in achieving its
goals.
   -- Credibility: Manage corporate credibility by avoiding overoptimism;
showcase operating management.
   -- Intelligence: Through systematic perception studies, provide senior
management with insight into how buy-side and sell-side analysts and
investors view the company's potential.
   -- Alternative media: Evaluate and be prepared to adopt new electronic
forms of communications, such as fax-on-demand, the Internet, and CD-ROM,
as their popularity among investors increases.
   -- Background: Explain the basics of new, unregulated businesses to
investors unfamiliar with them, providing investors with an analytical
framework, data, and insight into the investment potential of these new
areas.
   -- Engagement: Seek out investors rather than wait for them to express
interest.

SERENDIPITY OR SAVVY INVESTMENT? A CABLE VENTURE PAYS OFF

   In 1986, buying a cable company seemed like a good idea to Houston
Industries (HI). And as it turned out, it was--but for unexpected reasons.
Almost a decade ago, HI, the parent company of Houston Lighting & Power Co
(HL&P), the US's ninth largest investor-owned utility with $11.4-billion in
assets, entered the cable television business. The venture, which recently
ended with the sale of HI's KBLCOM, was important--not because it gave HI
cable expertise--but because the sale added $700-million to HI's books,
thus providing the company with overseas purchasing power.

The genesis
   Like other utilities, HI was coming out of the heavy construction period
of the 1970s and early 1980s, and was looking for diversified business
opportunities. Company executives were specifically interested in a
business that had some of the essential qualities of a utility-type
company: A large volume market with a captive audience.
   At the same time that HI was exploring diversification options, a
joint-venture deal between the New York City-based Warner Communications
and American Express Corp dissolved, sparking rumors that Warner's Dallas
and Houston cable properties would be sold. The speculation was enough to
send HI executives to Time Inc, New York, NY--owner of cable programming
giant Home Box Office--to consult with Time's cable experts about entering
the market.
   The meetings with Time eventually turned into a 50/50 joint venture
between HI and Time, called Paragon Inc. Although Paragon never acquired
Warner's Texas properties, in 1986 it did purchase 22 cable television
systems from Westinghouse's Group W, Pittsburgh, Pa. For the bargain price
of just over $500-million, Paragon took on almost 560,000 customers at a
historically low price of $900 per subscriber.
   Through Paragon, HI entered the cable business in such diverse locales
as upper Manhattan, NY; Tampa Bay, Fla; El Paso and Dallas/Fort Worth, Tex;
and Los Angeles County, Calif--and became involved in a business that
seemed tailored for anyone able to string new lines into thousands of
interested homes.

Growing a subscriber base
   By 1989, HI, independent of Paragon, sold off its once profitable oil
and gas business that it had operated since the early 1970s to pay
$1.3-billion for Canada's Rogers Communications. That deal gave HI access
to an additional 550,000 subscribers (at the significantly increased market
value of $2360 per head), who were tied to cable franchises in San Antonio
and Laredo, Tex; Minneapolis, Minn; Portland, Ore; and Orange County,
Calif.
   HI then formed a new cable subsidiary, KBLCOM, which combined its 50%
share of Paragon into the recently acquired Rogers properties. KBLCOM's
subscriber list was growing each year, and in 1994, it made its last
acquisition--this time paying just under $2000 per head for 47,000 new
subscribers in the Minneapolis area. In roughly an 8-yr period, HI had
formed a business that served a total of 967,000 cable customers on an
overall investment that reached $1.65-billion. Yet, what was HI's real
strategic goal?

An evolving vision
   At the end of the 1980s and into the early 1990s, the prevailing wisdom
was to get into the consumer's home, via cable, and hopefully extract
marketing information from customers that could be used in unforeseen ways
in the future. HI's management believed that within cable technology was
some kind of marketing enhancement capability that could be applied to
HL&P's existing 1.5-million electricity customers--the vast majority of
whom are residents in the Texas Gulf Coast area.
   By the end of 1994, HI was a utility holding company that reported
$399-million in income on revenues from continuing operations of
$3.7-billion. Arriving at this juncture, however, seems more like an
evolution rather than a direct path for HI.
   Since its inception in 1882, HI has been a company that was defined by
the history of its market. For example, HL&P, in 1901, became one of the
first utilities to burn oil instead of coal because of the huge oil finds
at Spindletop, Tex, only a few miles east of its generating plant. By the
1930s, natural gas from western Texas became plentiful--and today almost
65% of its 13,660 MW of installed capacity is gas-fired.
   However, challenging times were ahead. Since World War II, the so-called
big 19 oil refineries and petrochemical companies, (Exxon Corp, Dow
Chemical Co, DuPont Co, etc), increasingly began producing their own power.
The far more recent threat of retail wheeling is something HI has been
dealing with for a considerable period of time. Also, the debacle of the
South Texas nuclear project in the 1980s didn't help its image with many
customers.
   Already imbued with a view toward deregulation, HI went into the cable
business, thinking that it would lead the company into the
telecommunications age, and change the firm's status as only an energy
supplier. ``We saw the cable business as potentially profitable, with good
operating cash flow,'' says William A. Cropper, HI's vice president and
treasurer. ``We had good book earnings, but we were also pumping a lot of
money back into the business.''
   Along the way, adds Cropper, ``we were visiting with other cable firms
and telephone companies as well. And nobody seemed to be certain as to what
the technology advances meant.'' That was the main concern: Nobody could
say where, exactly, the future of cable or telecommunications was headed.
``Many said they knew, but few were right,'' says Cropper.

A time to sell
   In the early 1990s, Time Inc and Warner Communications merged, forming
Time Warner (TW). Because Denver (Colo)-based baby bell US West took a
$2.5-billion position in that merger, the pact became more significant.
But, even that deal paled against the proposed mega-deal between baby bell
Bell Atlantic, Newark, NJ, and the number one US cable company,
Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), Englewood, Colo, in the summer of 1994.
   Once again, the market sparked HI into action. The announcement of the
Bell Atlantic/TCI deal--which eventually collapsed--convinced HI that it
was time to assess its portfolio and cable holdings. Although HI's cable
operations were stable, it was still going to be several years before it
could be considered a major profit center, large enough within the industry
to be able to control its own destiny. Moreover, the business was requiring
more programming arrangements and product marketing than HI's executives
felt comfortable with.
   By August 1995, HI sold KBLCOM, including its 50% share in Paragon, to
TW. The deal drew little public attention. Nonetheless, TW paid HI almost
$2500 per subscriber as part of its $2.4-billion package.
   In the deal, TW assumed $650-million of KBLCOM external debt and other
liabilities, and purchased HI/KBLCOM intercompany debt for approximately
$620-million cash. The sale gave HI 1-million shares of TW common stock,
and 11-million shares of TW convertible preferred, with a total value of
approximately $1.1-billion. ``We booked a gain on the deal of $700-million
after tax, and we are also left with $1-billion in TW stock,'' says
Cropper. ``This made our balance sheet healthy--real fast.'' Indeed, HI has
seen equity vs debt rise from 39 to 48% since the end of 1994.
   With its cable sale has come a deepened commitment to the strategy it
has turned to replace diversification: overseas expansion of its core
utility business. HI's most recent international venture took place last
September in South America.

Global now, then
   In 1988, after HI had already entered the cable business, a new
opportunity surfaced. With very little international fanfare or support,
then embattled Argentine President RaPound l Alfonsn launched his so-called
Houston Plan. With it, formerly nationalistic Argentina was turning a
corner and reaching out to the oil and gas company executives in
Houston--still the world's energy capital. Within 18 months, Alfonsn's
successor, Carlos Menem, accelerated the process, cementing the new Houston
outreach program via a major privatization effort. In 1993, an HI-led
consortium assumed La Plata and Santiago del Estero electricity
distribution rights through the privatization process.
   HI's next global venture brought the company to the UK. There, last
September, HI's unregulated subsidiary, HI Energy, teamed with Central &
South West Corp (CSW), to make a run at acquiring Norweb plc, the electric
distribution company that serves 2-million customers in the northwestern
part of England, near Manchester. In what turned out to be a nerve-wracking
bidding war, HI and CSW saw their $2.7-billion bid topped in the end by the
UK-based North West Water Group, which won the distribution firm with a
price of $2.89-billion.
   According to Steve Schaeffer, senior vice president of finance at HI
Energy, the company's specific aim in Britain was to expand its
international distribution operations. While the company does not rule out
expansion of generation, executives believe that HI Energy is one of a
handful of international companies that can bring ``state-of-the-art''
billing and record-keeping systems to the table. ``We know that
distribution is often a political exercise, but we believe that is the area
we have the ability to add value,'' says Schaeffer.
   Indeed, HI Energy's experiences in Argentina, with its 350,000 customers
in Buenos Aires and Santiago del Estero provinces, has given it confidence
that it can work out kinks in distribution systems just about
anywhere--particularly in Latin America.
   Very much on the mind of HI executives today, is the perceived opening
of the Brazilian industry. ``Brazil is clearly in the same league as India
and China, in terms of potential,'' says Schaeffer. ``However, its
advantages may lay more in distribution than in generation. If the
government is going to continue building hydro facilities, I'm not sure I
want to build gas-fired units there.''
In India, where HI Energy is building the largest coke-calcining plant in
Asia, HI supports behind-the-fence projects, given the comparatively high
rates of return from Indian industrial customers. Schaeffer also believes
that India's local capital market is developing at such a fast rate that
before long, foreign companies will mainly be sought after for their
technical skills, and not for how deep their pockets are.
   For the moment, HI's pockets are plenty deep, thanks to its brief fling
in the cable business. The company is going to have to plow those profits
into something soon--or shareholders could be headed for a big windfall.

STATE EXPERIMENTS WITH RETAIL WHEELING

Last October, the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (PUC) announced
a 3-yr retail wheeling pilot program that hasn't left the spotlight since
its introduction. Source of both controversy and consideration, the program
is continuing efforts to open the electric power market to competition.
Yet, project implementation faces high hurdles, such as recovery of
stranded costs and resolution of federal and state jurisdictional issues.
   With most industry groups taking direct access as a matter of
inevitability, New Hampshire is seen as the test case. At issue for the
electric power industry in part is stranded cost recovery and its
implications for balance sheets and credit ratings. Standard & Poor's
(S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, is carefully watching the
terms the state PUC is devising for stranded-cost recovery. For the
utilities involved in the pilot, however, the news is good, notes S&P:
``[Its relatively small size] should allow the financial impact to be
manageable for the utilities involved.''
   The program is scheduled to begin May 1 and include 3% of the state's
electric peak load--about 60 MW. Although Michigan has announced a retail
wheeling program, it only covers incremental load growth and not existing
load. The New Hampshire program will involve the state's six major
utilities, including Public Service Co of New Hampshire (PSNH) which will
account for 44 MW of the pilot load.
   The project is expected to include all customer classes allocated
proportionately with random customer selection of interested parties.
Customers will be expected to bear the risks involved with the transactions
in making their own arrangements for a power provider and backup supplier.
However, these initial guidelines may be revised. Final guidelines were
expected on Dec 22, after press time.
   The PUC's preliminary guidelines divide the cost of stranded investments
equally between customers and shareholders. Therefore, according to S&P,
state utilities will not be able to fully recover stranded-investment
costs. The mechanism itself may be financially damaging to utilities if
finalized as New Hampshire's permanent mechanism in dealing with stranded
investment. This inability to fully recover costs that were allowed under
previous regulatory practices will almost certainly impact negatively on a
utility's credit-worthiness.
   Although the PUC notes that the stranded-cost mechanism is temporary and
subject to full review after the pilot program's first year, it conflicts
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) position that
utilities get an opportunity to recover identifiable and verifiable
stranded costs. But the PUC contends that it has exclusive jurisdiction on
intrastate transactions despite FERC's jurisdiction on wheeling. Result:
The jurisdictional conflict between state and FERC will most likely
escalate as the pilot progresses.
   In fact, the pilot has yet to begin and PSNH has already asserted its
claim that state regulatory commissions do not have the authority to order
retail wheeling--an echo of Detroit Edison Co's claim in its issue with the
Michigan PUC over its experimental retail wheeling program.
   To add fuel to the fire, a New Hampshire attorney is proposing a new
public utility to serve industrial customers with low-cost power available
on the wholesale market. The PUC could approve the utility-- Freedom
Electric Power Co--under a state law allowing competition in the public
interest. Freedom has already arranged to purchase 20 MW of capacity from
North Atlantic Energy Service Co's nuclear powerplant, Seabrook.

SAN FRANCISCO LEADS THE WAY FOR MUNIS

In a move closely watched by industry observers, the city of San Francisco,
Calif, is studying the formation of its own electric utility. Through its
consultant, Strategic Energy Ltd, Pittsburgh, Pa, the city is evaluating
whether or not it makes economic sense for its citizenry to break from
Pacific Gas & Electric Co and establish its own electric utility. Under
current federal regulations, municipal utilities can shop around for
low-priced power.
   However, at this point, San Francisco is just examining its options.
According to the consulting firm, the question posed by the city is whether
competition for the city's business would result in lower electricity
prices for consumers.

DIRECT ACCESS THREATENS UTILITY REVENUE
News and information about financial matters relevant to the electric power
industry provided by Standard & Poor's, a division of The McGraw-Hill
Companies

   Revenue--rather than stranded assets--is the key to credit quality when
the US electric power industry retail markets open to direct access,
explains Standard & Poor's (S&P), a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies.
A recent S&P study has determined that if direct access were to happen
today, industry revenues would decline between a moderate $10-billion
annually (6%) and a more troublesome $26-billion (16%). The range is based
on two scenarios that make assumptions about the extent to which customers
will opt for direct access and the degree to which lost revenue will be
recovered.
   Companies whose credit rating could be in jeopardy are those with the
potential for the most revenue deterioration. Each utility's potential lost
revenue indicates the degree of cost reduction it must effect to stave off
financial erosion under a direct-access scenario.
The financial risks occur when a utility's embedded costs cannot be
recovered in a declining price environment. At most risk are a utility's
own generation expenses and purchased-power contracts, since it appears--at
least for now--that the transmission and distribution end of the business
will remain regulated and insulated from competitive threats. Most
utilities are well aware of the exposures and are working toward a more
competitive cost structure.

Who is vulnerable?
   The severe case contemplates a situation in which direct access occurs
immediately for all customer classes and assumes no surcharge mechanism to
recover lost revenue.
   The more expected scenario assumes direct access for commercial and
industrial users only. While all customer classes are likely to have
competitive choices, as a practical matter, only the larger users are
expected to exercise that choice--at least initially. Residential customers
are initially less likely to switch from their local utility supplier.
   This scenario also assumes that 50% of commercial and industrial lost
revenue will be recovered in rates. In reality, S&P believes that
regulators will permit recovery of a higher percentage of lost revenue;
however, the exact portion will vary greatly among states. And, in the
final analysis, the market will decide how much it can bear.
   Under the moderate (6%) revenue-loss scene, utilities with the most to
lose are those with high generation costs and possibly a heavy industrial
load. Most utilities will be hard-pressed to cut costs sufficiently to
offset a potential double-digit reduction in revenue. On the other hand,
various risk-mitigation strategies are available to all utilities, and many
have already begun to implement cost-cutting measures in an effort to
preserve financial integrity.
   Utilities with the least vulnerability to direct retail access are those
with low generating costs and a modest industrial customer base. In
addition, utilities that will also do well will have competitively priced
excess-generating capacity and the ability to market that power nationwide.
Nevertheless, as the competitive landscape changes, even those companies
will need to adjust periodically to maintain their competitive advantages.

Market forces drive risk
   Market forces will continue to drive retail prices down, as long as
there is excess generating capacity. Moreover, customer self-generation and
fuel switching are tempting alternatives that will contribute to pricing
pressure.
   A large and efficient spot market for electricity is poised to emerge.
This too will contribute to pricing pressures. While regional pricing
differences now reflect supply and demand, prices will become more
homogeneous nationwide over time as cross-country power swaps expand
customer access to additional power sources. These displacement and
exchange deals, as well as technological advances, should highlight the
inefficiencies of the transmission grid and encourage improvements to
lessen any existing constraints and bottlenecks.
   Flexibility may dictate customer buying patterns--forcing some to rely
heavily on the spot market and short-term contracts. This would increase
competition for customers and possibly entice generators to run on smaller
reserve margins, freeing up even more generating capacity and driving
prices down further.
   Utilities with firm contracts with customers are less likely to lose
those customers but not completely immune from the risks of price and
revenue decline. To illustrate: Raytheon Corp asked for--and got--price
reductions from Massachusetts utilities so it would remain in-state.
   Nevertheless, with all of the proposals floating around, mandated direct
access is likely to emerge from federal or state regulators or legislators.
Utilities will continue to discount rates until the market rate drops to
the variable cost to generate power. If market rates are below variable
costs, a utility will no longer generate power from its most inefficient
plants, at least in theory.
   So why not do a plant-by-plant analysis to reveal uneconomic power
stations? S&P feels that most utilities run their systems as a portfolio.
Operating statistics for individual plants, such as capacity factor, change
constantly with fluctuating load patterns, fuel choices, plant
availability, and other management decisions. However, in the long term,
some plants will be closed and others built to take their places for
peaking and base-load capacity.

Mitigating risk
Most US utilities are already re-engineering their way to lower generation
costs. In the future, many may also decide to write off high-cost
assets--particularly if generation-related revenue is no longer regulated.
The resulting equity reduction is not a concern from a credit-quality
stance because it is a non-cash event. However, the eventual drop in
revenue as prices decline is a concern. But there are additional ways to
mitigate stranded costs other than reduction.
   One method is to seek recovery through rates. While the bulk of stranded
costs may be charged to ratepayers, the actual dollar amount is likely to
be tempered by political and market forces. Other strategies, such as
accelerated depreciation of plants or reallocation of costs to reduce
industrial subsidies, will continue to proliferate. The potential for lost
revenue is lower if generation assets can be further depreciated before
direct access becomes effective or if industrial rates can be reduced
without affecting cost recovery.
   Other options include aggressive marketing efforts to boost sales and
changes in purchased-power strategies. Some utilities may absorb part of
the above-market power-purchase costs to stay competitive-- despite a
regulated pass-through to customers.

utility group, contact John Bilardello at 212-208-1525 or Michael Cole at

GLOBALIZATION OF ELECTRICITY MARKETS

At a recent executive summit, CEOs, presidents, managers, and strategists
shared McGraw-Hill's insights into the current and future state of the
industry. Analysts from four divisions of The McGraw-Hill Companies
explained the what, when, and why of regional economic growth, electricity
demand, capacity expansions, changing structural and regulatory climates,
and trends in fuel prices and technologies. If you didn't attend
Globalization of Electricity Markets, here's what you missed

By:
John Javetski

   As an early-season snowfall blanketed New York City in late November,
electric power executives converged on the headquarters of The McGraw-Hill
Companies to participate in the first annual Globalization of Electricity
Markets conference. Sponsored by IBM's Utility and Energy Services
Industry, White Plains, NY, the two-day executive summit showcased the
collective marketing and technical expertise of personnel from several
divisions of The McGraw-Hill Companies, the world's largest supplier of
information to the global electricity marketplace.
   Energy specialists and technical/business analysts from Standard &
Poor's, DRI/McGraw-Hill (a unit of Standard & Poor's), the magazines
Electrical World and Electric Power International, and Utility Data
Institute (UDI)/McGraw-Hill joined guest speakers in providing a forum for
the audience of executives to discuss and debate the latest trends and
developments that are reshaping the global electric power industry, as well
as traditional relationships between risks and opportunities in the
business.
   The conference also marked the release of DRI/McGraw-Hill's worldwide
and regional forecasts of electricity demand, electricity prices, capacity
needs, regulatory and structural evolution, and fuel prices and mixes. This
report summarizes the conference sessions; unabridged versions of DRI's
forecasts for the 1995-2020 period can be found in its ambitious,
six-volume, multi-client study, titled ``The Future of the Electric Power
Industry Around the World'' (see box).

World economic outlook
   Roger Brinner, chief economist of DRI/McGraw-Hill, Lexington, Mass,
kicked off the conference by presenting DRI's rather upbeat worldwide
economic outlook, which was at the core of DRI's analyses of regional
electricity markets. Brinner began by predicting that GDP growth for the US
would be fairly moderate in the long term, averaging only about 2%/yr
between 1995 and 2020.
   The fundamental reason that economic growth will remain half a point
lower than the 2.5% it has averaged of late, he explained, is that growth
in both the US population and labor force recently shrank to about 1%, and
will remain there over the forecast period.
   But thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement, in 1995, Brinner
says the US lost about $20-billion worth of export sales to Mexico,
and--because of the devaluation of the peso--the US is now absorbing more
imports from Mexico that may have represented another $10- to $20-billion
of lost US production last year.
   Brinner then revealed why he remains optimistic about the economic
future of the US. Normally, in the late stages of an economic recovery,
capital spending on machine tools, computers, and plant and equipment
declines sharply. But that hasn't happened yet, based on recent figures for
new orders for most non-defense capital goods. Brinner concluded that there
are four unusual, positive elements in the current US economic cycle:
n New technology is economically obsoleting many types of equipment, from
process-control systems to business computers, and corporations can now
justify accelerating their capital-goods spending because of savings in
production and operations costs that they can reap.
   -- For foreign firms that sell into the US market, the dollar has become
so relatively cheap that many are locating their production facilities in
the US to an unprecedented extent, and those investments show up as US
capital spending.
   -- Inflation seems to have topped out in the US, because the Federal
Reserve Bank's 1994 interest-rate hikes were successful in keeping
unemployment from falling below 5.5 to 6%, and capacity utilization from
exceeding 85% --the balance points for today's US economy.
   -- Recent productivity growth has been so good that the manufacturing
sector has been able to keep its rate of price increases below that of
hourly compensation gains, while boosting its capital spending and
profitability. As a result, DRI predicts that the Federal Reserve will cut
interest rates by at least one-half percent over the next six months.

Reining in inflation
   Brinner was somewhat less optimistic about overall long-term economic
prospects for the rest of the world, especially Europe. However, he was
encouraged by worldwide efforts to rein in inflation. In the G-7 nations,
inflation should remain comfortably down at around 3% through the end of
the decade, and even the nations of economically overheated Asia seem to
have capped inflation at about 8%.
   Brinner characterized Europe's expected moderate but extended upswing as
disappointing, for the following reasons. Compared to the US, European
nations are experiencing an even more pronounced decline in their
populations and labor forces, and they're trying to cut their budgets to
meet the Maastricht Treaty requirements. Rampant pessimism among European
business leaders, which is tempering the short-term investment climate
there, is justified by Europe's untenable labor costs, which are twice
those of the US but with only 75 to 80% of its productivity.
   Brinner was more optimistic about Mexico and Latin America. He predicted
that the peso crisis, which cut the influx of international equity to
developing Latin American nations by an order of magnitude two years ago,
would not result in another lost decade like the 1980s. Why? This time, the
Latin American nations responded to the crisis by cutting their deficits,
accelerating privatization efforts, locking in economic reforms, and
reaffirming their integration with global trade.
   For Europe, Japan, and the US, DRI projects that inflation-adjusted
growth will be only 2 to 2.5% from 1995 to 2020. For the Middle East and
Africa, the former Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe, growth will be
3.5-4.5%. For Latin America, GDP growth will be approximately 5%, and for
Asia, about 5.5%.
   Brinner said the greatest opportunities, purely on a GDP basis, are in
the developing world. But in terms of demand for power, the opportunities
in high-GDP-growth regions are even richer because of the even faster
growth of the middle class there.
   Growth in the developing world will continue to exceed the rates of the
1970s and 1980s because of entrepreneurial government initiatives. The
fastest growing countries had higher rates of investment relative to GDP,
much higher rates of secondary-school enrollment, and greater openness to
trade. So, Brinner concludes that if you welcome equity investment and your
workforce is educated enough to make use of transferred technology, you can
grow rapidly.
   But there are risks to investing in emerging markets, Brinner reminded.
DRI recently launched a global risk service that delineates many dimensions
of those risks, recognizing that the risks facing direct foreign investors
are different than those facing, say, a portfolio investor. One conclusion:
today, Asia and Latin America offer the best risk/reward tradeoff of all
regions.

Fuels forecast
   Electric-utility executives care only about the relative--not the
absolute--prices of the fossil fuels that they burn, noted James Osten, a
principal with the Lexington (Mass) office of DRI/McGraw-Hill.
   So, in its fuels-price outlook, DRI also considers the availability,
demand, and end-user costs for oils, natural gas, liquified natural gas
(LNG), and coal on a relative basis. Osten explained that, as a bulk
commodity, the price of crude oil is determined strictly by supply and
demand. He mentioned that, facing sluggish demand forecasts and competition
from non-OPEC sources, OPEC itself may be anticipating that oversupply may
reduce the price of crude oil in the short term.
   But residual oil remains a key fuel whose price is commonly used as an
index in natural-gas contracts, Osten reminded. At present, the price of
pipeline gas--including fixed demand charges, a commodity part that
escalates with fuel-oil prices, and often-significant transportation
costs--appears to be capped by the price of fuel oil on one side, and by
the price of coal on the other.
   Osten then addressed the evolution of demand for the various fossil
fuels by region. He predicted that, across the board, the growth of demand
for oil will lag that for other fuels, even in the developing world. And
although demand for natural gas will grow fastest--in part because of its
penetration of power-generation sectors--eventually coal will become the
new fuel of choice for new base-load capacity as coal producers reduce
their prices in response to the challenge by gas.
   Today, however, natural gas is still the fuel of choice for new capacity
in the US, Osten said, thanks to the low heat rates and low capital costs
of the gas turbines it typically fires. However, the growth of demand for
gas in power generation will vary by region, with most of the developing
world craving more gas, and mature markets less.
   To complete the presentation on fuels, Osten passed the microphone to
Andrew Slaughter, principal, DRI/McGraw-Hill International Energy
Consulting, Paris, France. Slaughter began by summarizing his three key
predictions for coal:
   -- Power generation will remain the most important market for coal in
the developed world, and it will become more important in the developing
world.
   -- Coal will retain its dominant share of the worldwide market for
power-generation fuels, despite competition from gas in certain sectors
over certain periods of time within the forecast period.
   -- Because all signs point to a relatively stable and adequate supply,
and a moderation in its price over the long term, coal's cost advantage
over oil and gas will improve over the forecast period.
   When coal producers lose business with a mature-market utility sector,
he said, they don't recover it anywhere else in the region--which motivates
them to find ways to reduce their prices.
   In the developing world, coal markets are a little more diverse. In
Asia--the world's largest coal consumer--power generation accounts for 40%
of demand for coal, and in Latin America, 29%. However, Slaughter called
coal's penetration of the Latin American power-generation market poised for
growth.
   Slaughter explained that although current pressures--increasing regional
demand, emissions-abatement policies that mandate greater use of low-sulfur
coal, etc--seem to presage an upward movement in coal prices, DRI's
analyses conclude that, in all regions, the moderating influences on coal
prices, including a healthy supply situation, will continue to outweigh the
upward pressures.
   In the US, many long-term, high-price utility contracts for steam coal
are being replaced by shorter-term contracts at lower prices. In Europe,
privatization and the phasing out of subsidies to the coal-mining industry
are pushing coal prices down, nearer international levels. In Asia, with
its mix of subsidized and market prices, the trend isn't as clear, but the
adequacy of supply there is a moderating factor.
   Slaughter concluded his presentation with a prediction: In power
generation, moderating prices will improve coal's competitive position vs
oil and gas, and their rising prices will accelerate the effect. He pointed
out how the thermal-powerplant fuel mixes in the four major markets will
change over the next 25 years. Where coal is already dominant, it will
remain so. Coal's share will be hurt most by gas through the early years of
the next century, but after that, coal will rebound slightly.

Technology trends
   Jason Makansi, editor-in-chief of the magazines POWER and Electric Power
International, based in New York City, next identified discussed five major
technology trends. The most important, he said, is the transition from
steam turbines to gas turbines, many of which could be burning gasified
solid fuels within 10 to 15 years. The worldwide trend away from regulated
markets and toward a free-market orientation will only accelerate the
transition.
   That's why, at least in the short term, Makansi believes that natural
gas will not only cut into the market share now held by oil, but into the
share held by coal as well. In explaining how he came to the same
conclusion as DRI's economic analysts, Makansi cited the superior technical
and economic efficiencies of today's gas turbines, shorter-term financing
horizons, and environmental pressures.
   The second sweeping trend is the use of information-technology (IT)
systems to gain a competitive edge. Makansi explained that, by using
computers and telecommunications systems to run their powerplants and
transmission and distribution (T&D) systems, nations, utilities, and IPPs
alike can:
   -- Capture much of the design margin inherent in existing, older
equipment.
   -- Allow power systems to run more reliably, and with smaller reserve
margins.
   -- Reduce the costs of building and operating generating plants and T&D
systems.
   Makansi predicted that the process of building a new powerplant would
soon routinely entail not just the installation of generation hardware--but
also the integration of software and systems that allow operators up and
down the chain of command to monitor and control that hardware more
efficiently andesponsively. He suggested that there might be greater
potential for adding value and making profits in IT-based equipment than in
supplying or installing traditional gear.
   The third and fourth global trends mentioned by Makansi involve shifts
in priorities. Wherever competition makes electricity a commodity product
produced from a fuel, it becomes imperative for power producers to maximize
their control of that energy source at all points of the production
process. In competitive environments, utilities and independent power
producers (IPPs) might do better to concentrate on making their plants more
fuel-flexible, or using their IT systems to canvass the market for a better
deal on a fuel, rather than on acquiring the latest combustion
system--unless that system offers an immediate bottom-line payoff.
   The fifth technological trend involves reliability. When a developing
nation invites IPPs to build most or all of its expansion capacity, it also
fosters a climate that encourages short-term, profit-driven thinking--and
may discourage development of the very different mindset needed to plan
powerplants and T&D systems that will run reliably for 30 or 40 years. A
balance between private power and state-owned or monopolistic utilities may
be the best approach.
   In conclusion, Makansi noted that the electric power business has always
been driven by crises and catastrophes. Three Mile Island and Chernobyl,
the great Northeast Blackout, the oil shortages of the 1970s, droughts in
South America, and the local health crisis precipitated by an SO2 emissions
incident at the huge coal-fired Mae Moh, Thailand, all drove the industry
in directions that could not be foreseen. Market participants will push the
envelopes for performance, risk, profit, staffing, and reserve margins, but
with less certainty about the outcome--thanks to the parallel influence of
the invisible hand of the free market.

World capacity and structural overview
   Christopher Bergesen, vice president and editorial director of Utility
Data Institute (UDI)/McGraw-Hill, Washington, DC, and Marie Leone,
editorial director of Electrical World magazine, provided brief overviews
of those subjects.
   Bergesen led off with a UDI projection that conventional steam turbine/
generator systems will comprise 44% of worldwide new capacity additions
from 1994 to 2003, which put Makansi's first gas-turbine technology trend
in perspective. Bergesen said that all the diesels, gas turbines,
industrial cogeneration systems, and mini-hydro plants being planned and
installed today collectively don't amount to all that much in terms of
installed base.
   UDI's 10-yr rolling projection of new-capacity additions reflected the
fact that many private-power projects around the world have been stalled.
Bergesen said that after he crunched his numbers a year ago, he anticipated
that 100 GW of new capacity would be installed worldwide in 1995. Now,
however, it looks like only 75 or 80 GW of new plants were commissioned.
   In overviewing the structural and regulatory issues that are guiding the
transformation of the North American electricity market, Leone said that
the shifting ground beneath the feet of US electric-utility executives has
become a breeding ground for innovative business arrangements.
Investor-owned utilities are merging, branding their products, and spinning
off dedicated generation, distribution, and transmission companies.
   But the most interesting activity in the US electric power arena isn't
between utilities, Leone claimed; it's among utilities and companies from
different industries. Electric utilities are partnering with computer
companies, commodity brokers, cable companies, telecommunications firms,
and even their industrial customers. New species--power marketers, load
aggregators, and merchant plants--are evolving to meet the new,
service-oriented, and information-driven needs of the competitive market.
   Leone concluded that participants in the new electric power industry
should prepare for the future by arming themselves with historical
perspective in one hand, and forward thinking in the other.

North America: Regulatory outlook
   Richard Hilt, president of Bright Line Energy Inc, Palo Alto, Calif,
seized on Leone's overview of change in the US electric power industry as a
springboard for delving into specifics. Hilt broke up the restructuring
problem into three critical elements: regulatory reform, the unbundling of
utilities, and new pricing mechanisms.
   He prefaced his discussion by predicting that the industry's transition
from regulation to competition will be neither smooth nor rapid. As
evidence, he pointed out that states are not waiting for the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) to follow the notice of proposed rulemaking
(NOPR) it published last spring with final deregulatory rules this spring,
before they try to advance on their own toward competition. But although
California, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin have taken the lead in increasing
consumers' access to lower priced electricity, the implementation of open
access among customers and suppliers at the state level is still years
away.
   At the federal level, Hilt said, a section of the FERC NOPR addresses
the second of his three elements--unbundling. FERC appears to want, at a
minimum, utilities to unbundle themselves into functional entities that
cannot deal directly with each other, similar to the situation that used to
exist between the commercial and trust portions of banks. But utilities
don't currently track their costs that way, he said, so expect additional
delays as they learn how to do that.
   Presently, Hilt explained, electricity rates are set based on
utility-cost allocations to various customer classes, and utilities must
try to recover their costs--largely generation costs--using those rate
structures. With functional unbundling, however, the new pricing mechanism
might base prices on utilities' average production costs, on net production
costs, or even on their average variable costs.
   But if competition and open access are successful in lowering consumers'
electricity bills, Hilt asked, how might utilities reduce their costs and
still make a profit? They could cut their production costs by operating
their powerplants more efficiently, but the economics of that option don't
look too promising to Hilt. Another way that utilities can cut costs is by
writing down their generation assets, Hilt continued. But writing down
assets, he claimed, only changes a utility's fixed production costs;
variable costs--except in the Northeast, where fuel costs are high--pretty
much stay the same. As a result, Hilt again predicted, distribution
companies will be the focus of utilities' attention when they look to
reduce their costs in response to the lowering of tariff rates.

North America: Demand and capacity forecasts
   Susan Haltmaier, a principal based in DRI/ McGraw-Hill's Lexington
(Mass) office, continued Hilt's discussion of US regulatory and
restructuring issues, extended it to Canada, and drew some interesting
conclusions about the implications of DRI's North American
electricity-demand and new-capacity forecasts. First, she introduced the
analytical concept of alternative scenarios--under which restructuring
proceeds at different speeds--that DRI applied to all world regions during
the creation of its six-volume study.
   For the US, the three scenarios make different assumptions about when
retail wheeling will be implemented, and about how much of their stranded
costs utilities will be allowed to recover, Haltmaier explained. She said
that the reference scenario assumes that retail wheeling will arrive
gradually, and that utilities will be forced to unbundle their generation,
transmission, and distribution assets. The reference scenario also assumes
that utilities will be allowed to partially recover their stranded costs,
which complex calculations reveal would be about $88-billion.
   Under the liberalization scenario, the move to open access and retail
wheeling would occur more quickly, and more utility customers would be at
risk of changing suppliers, so stranded costs would be higher, at
$160-billion. However, under this scenario, utilities would be allowed to
recover none of that total. At the other end of the spectrum, the
retrenchment scenario assumes that retail wheeling will not become a
reality by 2020; as a result, fewer customers will leave, stranded costs
will amount to only $58-billion, and utilities will be allowed to recover
all of that total--through surcharges to the industrial sector and slightly
higher prices for residential and commercial customers.
   Haltmaier also predicted that, regardless of the speed with which it
takes place, deregulation will even out electricity prices across all
regions of the US. She said that the biggest beneficiaries of the lower
prices will be commercial users and homeowners, who currently pay for 80 to
90% of utilities' capital charges.
   Turning next to electricity demand, Haltmaier reminded the audience that
US demand is growing at only 1.4%/yr, and net new-capacity needs are a
miniscule 0.8%/yr. However, electricity is taking markets away from oil in
end-use fuel markets, and it is even cutting into natural gas' dominant
share of the residential and industrial sectors.
   Regardless of its pace, deregulation will also affect what type of new
capacity will be added to the US installed base between now and 2020.
According to the DRI study, deregulation favors gas-fired over coal-fired
capacity. Although coal prices and interest rates will fall, coal still
won't be able to compete with gas on a least-cost basis until 2015, when
the 40-yr licenses on many US nuclear plants expire. All three scenarios
assume that those plants won't be repowered; they will just be retired and
replaced by new coal-fired capacity.
   In Canada, where utilities are owned and regulated by the provinces,
under the reference scenario, unbundling would be gradual, but hydropower
development would slow in the face of stagnant demand growth, Haltmaier
said. Under the liberalization scenario, unbundling would occur sooner, and
half of the provincial utilities would be privatized, but there still would
not be much hydro development because the private sector would be dominant.
Under the retrenchment scenario, Canadian utilities would cooperate more
with each other to build some large hydro and coal-fired projects, and then
wheel those new kilowatt-hours through Quebec--whose potential lack of
cooperation makes this scenario least likely.

Western Europe: Regulatory outlook
   Moving on to Western Europe, Silvia Pariente-David, director of
DRI/McGraw-Hill's Global Energy Group, Paris, France, said that there has
been a region-wide trend toward liberalization of national electricity
sectors, including increasing participation by IPPs. The trend has resulted
both from initiatives at the European Union (EU) level to introduce
competition into the sector, and from individual nations' efforts to
increase competition and/or sell off their electric utilities for
much-needed cash.
   Addressing the EU initiatives first, Pariente-David said that full
implementation of the Internal Energy Market (IEM) could radically change
the structure of the industry in Western Europe. But so far, she added,
progress toward the goal of a single market has been painfully slow, and is
currently stalled. In 1992, the EU issued a directive which proposed, among
other things, the phasing in of regulated third-party access (TPA)--the
European equivalent of US retail wheeling--to transmission networks. At the
request of the industry, the directive was amended in 1993 to replace
regulated TPA by negotiated TPA.
   Then, in 1994, before TPA could begin to be implemented, France
suggested that it be replaced by the single-buyer system (SBS), in which a
single entity would buy and sell electricity and prioritize the dispatching
of generation. Since then, the commission has been studying whether and how
SBS could be modified to make it compatible with SBS. If the two concepts
can be made compatible, the EU would allow member states to choose one or
the other.
   At the national level, several governments are taking their own
initiatives to liberalize their electric power sectors and introduce
competition, with or without privatization, according to Pariente-David.
Several camps have developed, she said: The UK and the Nordic countries are
pushing for reform, and the UK and Norway have already taken steps to
unbundle and/or privatize their utilities and introduce competition; France
and Luxembourg oppose liberalization; and the other countries must still be
collectively classified as ambiguous.
   In conclusion, Pariente-David displayed a slide that ranks the EU
nations under the reference scenario strictly by the amount of new capacity
available to IPPs, and delineates that capacity by type--standard
generation, renewable waste and cogeneration (RCW) and combined heat and
power (CHP) autoproduction. Worth noting, she said: Italy looks positive
for RWC, but less so for CHP/autoproduction because much industrial
generating capacity already exists; Spain is positive in all three
categories; and Portugal is attractive for both standard generation and
RWC, largely because the government hopes to use new IPP gas-fired capacity
to reduce the country's dependence on fickle hydropower.

Western Europe: Demand and capacity forecasts
   Continuing Pariente-David's discussion of Western Europe, Andrew Ellis,
an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill's Global Energy Group, Paris, France,
presented some of DRI's predictions of how much and why the region's
electricity prices, electricity demand, installed capacity, and fuel mix
will change between now and 2020. Ellis began by stating that, in 1994, the
average electricity price in Western Europe was about 5 cents/kWh.
   Under the reference scenario, Ellis continued, average generating costs
would rise slightly, to between 5 and 6 cents/kWh, over the forecast
period. But under the liberalization scenario, with full TPA/SBS,
industrial electricity prices would rise dramatically in certain countries
and fall dramatically in others as patterns of electricity exchange change.
For example, factories in Portugal (-40%), Switzerland (-32%), and Italy
(-28%) would receive much-lower electric bills, but Norwegian and Swedish
factories would pay 12% more for their power. To summarize, Ellis said that
under the liberalization scenario, average industrial prices in Western
Europe would fall an average 12.5% by 2020; under the retrenchment
scenario, however, they would rise an average 14.3% by the same year.
   Ellis then explained how the level of openness of the EU electricity
market might affect the costs and character of new capacity. Using a bar
chart from the DRI study, he showed that, under the reference scenario,
coal would become competitive with gas toward the end of the forecast
period; under the liberalization scenario, however, that would not be the
case. Because coal will be unable to go toe-to-toe with gas for quite a
while, DRI predicts that most of the new capacity to be installed in
Western Europe through 2020 will be gas-fired.

Eastern Europe
   Matthew Sagers, director of energy services for PlanEcon Inc,
Washington, DC, next turned the audience's attention to Eastern Europe and
the former Soviet republics.
   Like the rest of the world, the nations of Eastern Europe have begun to
decentralize, unbundle, and privatize their state-owned utilities with the
goal of introducing free-market competition. The two most important drivers
of power-sector reform in the region are the shift of economies from a
supply to a demand orientation, and the changing structure of electricity
demand. In the past, when heavy industry accounted for 50 to 75% of
consumption, utilities could run base-load nuclear and coal-fired plants
with very high load factors and pay very little attention to peak
requirements. But as residential and commercial consumption rise, Sagers
predicted, more gas-fired capacity will be needed and installed.
   Because of excess capacity and low projected levels of demand, gross
capacity additions in the region will be small, and most of that will
replace aging plants that will be retired by 2015. Most of the additions
and retirements will be in Russia, Poland, and the Ukraine, Sagers said. As
is the case elsewhere, natural gas will be the generation fuel of choice in
the region, mainly at the expense of coal.
   Although many of the region's governments have discussed privatizing
their electric utilities, progress has been very slow, Sagers reported. The
countries furthest along are the Czech Republic and Hungary; both have
unbundled their state-owned power companies and sold minority stakes in
them.

Asia
   Shifting gears, from struggling Eastern Europe to fast-growing Asia,
Andrew Slaughter returned to the podium to address that region's regulatory
and structural issues.
   In the industrializing Asian nations, Slaughter explained, state-owned
electric utilities and their governments have reached the limits of their
financial capacity to satisfy explosive demand growth, and power-supply
systems are cracking under the pressure. To cope with relentless demand,
countries are joining the rest of the world in considering private power
alternatives.
   For analytical purposes, Slaughter said, it makes sense to consider the
countries of Asia as two groups. One group comprises: the older tigers
(Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong); the tiger cubs (Thailand,
Indonesia, and Malaysia); Pakistan; the Philippines; and, of course, India
and China--whose sheer size and potential dwarf the others. DRI projects
that new-capacity needs in those nations will collectively grow at an
annual rate of 5.8% between now and 2020. The other group's members are
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and Turkey; their needs will grow at a
more-mature 1.5% rate, according to DRI. For Asia as a whole, DRI pegs
annual new-capacity growth at 4.5% over the forecast period, Slaughter
said.
   Where will that new capacity come from? Strapped for cash, Asian
governments are being forced by foreign sources of capital such as the
World Bank to restructure their electricity sectors, make their supply
systems more efficient, and/or introduce competition by creating a
favorable climate for IPPs. However, only the Philippines has yet attracted
much inward investment.
   But despite setbacks in China and India, Slaughter predicted that, in
the long term, relentless demand growth and capital shortages will force
the governments of the industrializing Asian countries to make their region
attractive to inward investment. However, although many of those countries
are saying that they expect the private sector to build most of their
needed capacity expansions, Slaughter doesn't think that that's a feasible
objective. He expected that as governments reform their electricity
sectors, they and their state-owned utilities will retain the ability to
build their own powerplants. As a result, DRI projects that IPPs will not
dominate new-capacity additions in Asia.
   Although the total IPP contribution of 250 GW is significant, it is
considerably less than what the Asian nations will need, and what their
governments are saying they want, said Slaughter.

Asian fuel mix
   Christophe Barret, senior associate with DRI/McGraw-Hill, Hong Kong,
followed Slaughter's presentation with DRI's projections for
power-generation fuel mixes in Asia over the forecast period. China, he
said, will be responsible for most of the new oil-fired capacity installed
through 2010, because it is desperate for power now, and lacks the
pipelines needed to support widespread use of gas.
   Barret also predicted that Asia will see much more local development of
gas-fired facilities than individual countries--Philippines and Indonesia,
in particular--are now predicting, and that India, Japan, and Thailand will
lead the pack in overall installed capacity. China, he said, will dominate
in the use of coal for power generation. Barret assumes that China will
install most of its new coal-fired capacity in its coal-rich northern
provinces, and then transport the electricity generated to regions of high
consumption--such as Beijing and the eastern provinces.

Latin America
   Moving on to another fast-developing market, Michael Roach, an associate
with DRI/McGraw-Hill, Lexington, Mass, completed the regional forecasts
with a look at Latin America. Roach listed four developments that are
driving the industrializing countries of South America and Central America
to make the regulatory and institutional changes needed to make their
electric power sectors more market-oriented:
n Nations that rely heavily on hydroelectric power continue to experience
droughts that cause capacity shortages.
   -- Ill-conceived and poorly developed power projects have squandered
investment capital.
   -- Financial constraints and investment bottlenecks have arisen as
countries implement conservative fiscal and monetary policies designed to
control inflation.
   -- The economic integration of the region is forcing the Latin American
countries to compete for foreign capital, motivating them to create more
favorable and predictable investment and business climates.
   Roach expressed confidence that Latin America will continue down the
free-market path. Argentina's and Chile's privatization programs have borne
fruit, proving that liberalization and competition can lower electricity
prices and elevate economic efficiency. Economic liberalization, he added,
would also creates capital markets for IPPs and financial instruments to
facilitate power trade. With stable capital markets, there would be more
local financing, which he called the key to the success of private power in
the region.
   Turning to country specifics, Roach said that Mexico has already
deregulated its natural-gas industry, so it is now possible to plan a
powerplant assuming the availability of competitively priced gas from a
local source or the US. But all privately generated electricity must still
be sold to CFE, the state-owned electric utility, and CFE has been
reluctant to purchase anything except peak power. Proceeds from Bolivia's
capitalization program for its national electric utility are earmarked for
pension funds that could be used to finance further private investment. In
Ecuador, widespread and severe brownouts and blackouts will likely result
in accelerating the government's reform efforts. Even giant Brazil seems
committed to reform.
   Which countries offer the biggest and best opportunities? DRI's capacity
forecast for the eight largest countries of Latin America shows an overall
need for 242 GW of new capacity between now and 2020, with Brazil's 122 GW
accounting for half of the total. However, as in Asia, the levels of IPP
participation in national expansions will be lower than currently expected,
ranging from 8% in Ecuador to 43% in Argentina.

Investment insight
   William Chew, managing director for project finance at Standard &
Poor's, followed the release of DRI's annual regional forecasts with the
first of two S &P discussions on investment in the electric power business.
For the last five years, Chew explained, many of the world's infrastructure
projects have been non-recourse financed--that is, their debt is financed
by their revenues. With power projects, credit-rating agencies look hard at
the potential risks to those revenues.
   The importance of credit ratings rose in 1995, Chew noted but so did
business risk. But despite the Mexican peso crisis and India's troubled
Dabhol project Chew remained optimistic that non-recourse and
limited-recourse financing would continue to fuel infrastructure projects
around the world. What's more, he predicted, the increased use of credit
ratings will help broaden the circle of investors in those projects to
include not just specialist investors, but new sources--such as pension
plans and insurance portfolios.
   Chew described five long-term factors that are making project finance
more revenue-driven, and attractive to a larger pool of investors:
   -- The developing world's thirst for new infrastructure and generating
capacity is inexorable.
   -- Banks are currently in the midst of a cycle of substantial liquidity.
They are looking to make not only higher-yielding investments, but
investments in vehicles--such as project finance--that also offer
opportunities for higher fees.
   -- Managers of annuity-driven portfolios are seeking to optimize their
holdings with risk-adjusted, long-term, high-yield investments--such as
project loans, and several new institutions have entered the field.
   -- The focus of financial institutions has shifted away from traditional
direct lending and toward non-recourse debt financing and serving as a
catalyst for project financing from other sources.
   -- New project-finance structures are evolving. Big developers are now
using balance sheets to secure a holding-company-level debt issue with the
combined equity flows of all their projects.
   Wrapping up his talk, Chew said that project-finance specialists have
learned--occasionally the hard way--that electric power projects must have
a sound economic foundation, and that financial engineering has limits. As
an example, Chew cited the tendency for developers and lenders to allocate
currency risks to foreign power purchasers. But, he said, that practice
exposes investors to the risk that when a currency weakens, so will the
chances of keeping electricity prices low and the purchaser's ability to
pay.
   Curtis Moulton, managing director of corporate finance for Standard &
Poor's, followed Chew's discussion on IPP project finance with a
dissertation on debt ratings of US investor-owned utilities. Compared with
companies in other industries, Moulton began, electric utilities are
relatively highly rated. But utilities' credit excellence is being
imperiled, he said, by the rising business risks that retail competition
will bring.
   Competition, Moulton predicted, will result in lower electricity prices
and lower earnings. How much and how quickly will prices fall? Moulton said
that that will be determined by whether the view of FERC or individual
states on stranded-cost recovery prevails. In its NOPR, FERC proposes that
utilities be allowed to recover the costs they incur when wholesale
customers leave a utility system. Although FERC's philosophy sounds good in
theory, in practice, it is not clear whether departing customers will pay
100% of utilities' stranded costs.
   At the level of the states, one trend is clear: a shift from cost-based
to market-based regulation. Moulton said that one increasingly popular tool
in the latter category is performance-based regulation; using that
approach, a utility's earnings remain regulated, but they are linked to its
ability to achieve certain performance objectives in such areas as customer
service and fuel purchasing. He expected that distribution operations would
eventually come under performance-based regulation.
   Moulton predicted that the popularity of market-based regulation would
eventually overwhelm local sympathies for letting utilities recover all of
their stranded costs. State regulators, he explained, are under a lot of
pressure to cut electricity rates soon--rather than 10 years from now, when
utilities' stranded costs would be recovered under FERC's timetable. As a
result, Moulton expects that state regulators will allow utilities to
recover most of their stranded costs through a surcharge on distribution;
the remainder will be absorbed by utility shareholders. To the extent that
utilities can't offset their losses by cutting their operating costs, their
profits will suffer--potentially substantially.
   Moulton predicted that widespread direct access or its marketplace
equivalent will be in place well before the end of the decade. But the
intervening uncertainty won't be comforting to investors, he added.
Therefore, Moulton says that the credit outlook for US electric utilities
as a group is poor. However, there are reasons for optimism: Interest rates
are low and falling; utilities are continuing to reduce their cost of
capital with refinancings; and managements are reducing their operating
costs and capital expenditures. As a consequence, industry cash flow is
strong, providing opportunities for debt reduction.

Electricity futures: Just around the corner
   Daniel McElduff, an energy analyst in the Research Dept of the New York
Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), provided conference participants with a sneak
preview of a key aspect of the electric power industry of the future. He
explained how Nymex's futures and options contracts for electricity will
soon help utilities, merchant plants, and power marketers manage their risk
by allowing them to assess and lock in the price of the electricity that
they buy and sell.
   With the development of any competitive marketplace, McElduff explained,
participants need new tools to assess the price of the underlying
commodity. One such tool is McGraw-Hill's Power Markets Week newsletter,
which provides price assessments for points throughout the US, and another
will be Nymex's electricity futures and options contracts. The futures
contract facilitates standard transactions that are negotiable only as to
the price and the month in which electricity is to be delivered.
   What advantages are there in being able to assess the price of
electricity? With a forward price assessment, McElduff explained, you can
compare the expected future price to historical data and make more-informed
purchase or sales decisions. That's increasingly important, he added, given
the recent volatility of electricity prices. You could also use forward
price assessment to aid project planning and development.

IBM and the challenge of change
   ``Success goes to those able to accept and develop new ways of doing
business, and to those who can anticipate--and even accelerate change,''
noted featured speaker Kevin Moonan, general manager, IBM's Utility and
Energy Services Industry, at McGraw-Hill's Globalization of Electricity
Markets executive summit. As sponsors of the two-day summit, IBM's
commitment to the global electric power market was highlighted in two
talks--one by Moonan, the other by IBM's general manager, Europe, Ulf
Gundemark--that captured the essence of a market in flux.
   Moonan described the electric power market as one where rivals are
becoming allies, companies are developing new markets and services, and
ultimately, new revenue streams are being derived from unexpected places.
As energy becomes a commodity, added Moonan, service will be the key
differentiator.
   One key to opening the market's potential: Information technology (IT),
asserts Moonan. Just as Hong Kong Hospital issues wallet-size optical cards
that contain full medical records of their patients, and Levi Strauss
offers custom-made clothing you can order via the Internet, and Federal
Express puts the power to track packages in its customer's hands, so will
IT revolutionize the way electric power companies do business, said Moonan.
He then noted four strategic thinking points relevant to his discussion:
n IT is of critical importance in light of all the changes within the
industry.
   -- It is a defining technology--and how it is used can determine
potential winners and losers.
   -- All companies will compete on the basis of information as well as on
products and services.
   -- The fiercest competitors could be the ones that are not in the
industry today because they don't carry the baggage and the mindset of the
old way of doing things.
   Gundemark, in his presentation, likened today's economic transition to
the 19th century shift from farms to factories--the steam engine made
possible mass production then, just as computer-based IT now enables
large-scale acquisition and processing of information and faster
communications.
   Gundemark talked about the continued opening of borders to people,
capital, and communications that is driving utilities to compete in
international markets, and the disintegration of local differences. For
utilities in the developed world, says Gundemark, IT systems will likely be
the only tools which separate the winners from the losers.

DISTRIBUTECH CONFERENCE

By:
Philip I. Dunklin and Warren B. Causey

   Electric, telephone, cable, and wireless services will vie for control
of the customer in the competitive future, and kilowatt-hours will become
nothing but a commodity, says Philip O'Connor, managing director of Palmer
Bellevue, a division of Coopers & Lybrand, Chicago, Ill. He also believes
electric utilities are in the best position to win those battles because
``electric wire is the hardest to replicate'' of the existing conduits into
the home.

`Electricom' is next
   ``The next really big thing we will see is the emergence of a kind of
`electricom' or `telectric' business in which electric utilities will
become major players in the next round of development of the information
superhighway,'' O'Connor says. ``The reason is that a lot of electric
utilities are going to be partnering with personal communications system
[PCS] firms. PCS represents an opportunity to overlay or leapfrog the
existing copper system and to be much more versatile.''
   Telecommunications will give electric utilities an opportunity to
``leverage brand equity where they have it, and build it where they
don't,'' O'Connor adds.
   O'Connor will bring that optimistic assessment of electric utilities'
future to the 1996 DA/DSM DistribuTech Conference in Tampa Bay, Fla, Jan
15-18, as one of two keynote speakers at the conference. The other keynote
address will be by William Tucker, a member of the Wyoming Public Service
Commission and also an advocate for the ``appropriate use of information
technology in energy distribution.''
   While O'Connor's sanguine view of the electric-utility industry move to
dominate the customer telecommunications linkage of the future is not
shared by all experts, such a viewpoint will be pervasive at the 1996
conference. In fact, the advent of the information superhighway has changed
the very nature of the distributed automation/ demand side management
(DA/DSM) meeting, says Stuart Harrison, founder and director of the
conference.
   ``The movement toward this being the leading industry information
technology/ business conference as opposed to focusing on one element,
distributed automation, or load management, is the greatest change this
year,'' Harrison comments. ``The term DA/DSM never really covered what we
do, so this year we've demonstrated that by extending the program to cover
all aspects of utility information technology and its applications for
distribution companies.''

Entry of industry giants
   Another indication of the shift in attention, both of this conference
and of the industry as a whole, is in vendor support, Harrison says.
Several years ago, when the conference started, support came from smaller
specialty vendors who produced DA or DSM products. The 1996 conference is
being sponsored by IBM Corp, AT&T, Digital Equipment Corp, and other big
players, Harrison notes.
   One reason O'Connor is a big promoter of electric utilities getting more
involved in the telecommunications boom is that telecom may represent a way
to offset ``stranded assets,'' which he says is the current major concern
of the industry. He believes utilities eventually will have to settle for
considerably less than full recovery of assets stranded by competition, but
that telecommunications can help ease the pain.
   ``When you compare the potential total revenues in information
communications [infocom] systems with the kind of money needed to cope with
the stranded generation cost issue, even a modest share of infocom could
have a significant effect if a utility can leverage brand equity,''
O'Connor asserts. A Coopers & Lybrand/Palmer Bellevue chart shows that by
2003, telecom is expected to generate an estimated $480-billion in revenue.
In 1993, it generated nearly $250-billion. That compares with an estimated
$130-billion in total stranded costs potential faced by electric utilities,
he says.

The link
   O'Connor says he sees tremendous potential in the ``utility infocom
alliances emerging'' between electric utilities and:
   -- Local telephone exchange companies (regional Bell operating
companies).
   -- Incumbent long distance providers (AT&T, MCI, Sprint).
   -- Cable television firms (TCI, Time-Warner, Cox Communications).
   -- PCS providers.
   -- Software vendors (Microsoft, Novell).
   -- Computer companies (IBM).
   In addition, O'Connor points to several technological developments
driving electric utility/telecom alliances; many of which will be on
display or under discussion in Tampa Bay. These include:
n Utility radio spectrum auctions.
   -- Electric wires carrying signals (power-line carrier or PLC).
   -- The digital revolution: smart metering/energy controls.
   -- Real-time pricing.
   -- T&D reliability and control.
   -- Implementation of cost identification information systems.
   -- On-site distributed generation and energy storage.
   All of these elements bode well for electric utilities becoming
information providers in the future, O'Connor says. Utilities already have
the in-place infrastructure of towers, poles, conduit, buildings, wire, and
fiber optics. More important, utilities have rights-of-way in high-density
urban markets and a competitive rural facilities network.

Brand and fiber
   O'Connor is particularly impressed that electric utilities already have
more than 100,000 miles of fiberoptic cables, and that such utilities as
Baltimore Gas & Electric Co, Houston Lighting & Power Co, Los Angeles Dept
of Water & Power, Scana Corp, and Tampa Electric Co are leasing excess
fiber capacity. In addition, electric utilities have basic skills that can
contribute to infocom alliances, he says, including, expertise in system
engineering, maintenance, outage repair, site installation, union
negotiation, and regulatory permits.
   Electric utilities generally have good reputations for quality and
reliability, as well as ``ubiquitous customer penetration.'' These two
elements constitute considerable ``brand equity,'' O'Connor stresses.
   Infocom capabilities will determine winners and losers in a competitive
environment, notes O'Connor. But he also preaches there is a ``danger of
doing nothing.'' If utilities do not become involved in telecom, they may
find themselves becoming a commodity provider only. Information service
providers will own the value-added equipment, he says. He also warns
utilities not to wait about becoming involved in telecommunications.
Waiting runs the risk of decreased penetration of the market as well as the
problem that recovering lost customers is difficult. It is easier to keep a
customer than to find a new one, he notes.

Experts speak out
   In addition to the telecom emphasis of this year's DA/DSM Conference,
Harrison says the nature of the presentations has changed as well. In the
past, virtually all presentations were based on voluntary submissions.
While there still will be 70 papers presented, there will be 14 sessions in
which speakers or panelists were invited because of their expertise in
certain areas. ``We think that's an unusual amount in a conference program
that historically has focused on adjudicated submissions,'' he says. ``This
year we've been proactive and gone out and sought the movers and shakers.
We put all those folks into what we call expert laboratories.''
   Some of those expert laboratories will include:
   -- Innovative pricing in a restructured utility environment.
   -- The business case underlying the need for change in utility
operations.
   -- Organizing for success in the competitive market.
   -- Owning the customer relationship through information technology.
   -- The leading edge of energy innovation: Implementing advanced energy
services.
   This year's conference will feature 400 exhibitors and is expected to
attract about 3000 participants, Harrison says.

Genesis Services: Where AMR possibilities begin
   In a first-of-its-kind move, Itron Inc, Spokane, Wash--a supplier of
energy information and communications solutions--has formed a new
division--Genesis Services--to provide the electric, gas, and water
utilities industry with automatic meter reading (AMR) services that include
outsourcing, networked communications applications, business partnering,
and financing. More important, through Genesis Services, Itron offers
utilities the financial flexibility to take advantage of capital-intensive
AMR projects, which are considered by some industry experts to be one of
the critical links to customers and consumption patterns.
   Working much like a capital venture firm, Genesis can help utilities
build an AMR program that provides a custom fit for their bottom line. ``We
can bring financial advisors to the table,'' says Dominic Geraghty,
president Genesis Services.
   Itron executives identified a need for AMR project partnering as
competitive pressures forced utilities to rethink strategic goals and plan
for the information revolution. As a result, Genesis Services designed a
graduated partnership program to address the issues its customers face.
``If we develop an AMR outsourcing program for a utility, we enter the
arrangement as a partner, not a vendor, and that includes performance
guarantees,'' notes Geraghty.
   Genesis also installs and implements AMR networks--from installing
radios in the meters to moving that information into the utility billing
system--as well as provides software expertise for such market-driven
applications as real-time pricing, time-of-use, and customer information
systems.

WHO CONTROLS THE 'LAST INCH'?

By:
Paul Kemezis

   When the nation's public utility commissioners met in New Orleans, La,
recently, the entire electricity debate came down to an inch of wire. At a
time when the whole idea of utility regulation is being questioned, the
hundreds of professional regulators in attendance at the annual meeting
knew instinctively that every inch would count.
   In this case, the inch under debate was the last bit of the electric
distribution system before it enters Mr John Q. Public's house. The
infamous inch is attracting special attention because it could become the
last bastion of state regulation in the $200-billion/yr electric power
industry.

First shot
   In its March 1995 notice of proposed rulemaking (the so-called Mega
NOPR), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) asserted that once
power generation, transmission, and distribution services were unbundled in
a restructured electric industry, federal logic held that control of
interstate commerce could give FERC control over the entire US electric
transmission and distribution system.
   State regulators, represented by the National Assn of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners (Naruc), Washington, DC, immediate bristled, seeing an
invasion of their traditional jurisdiction over local electric distribution
systems. More than that, many state commissions believed that complete FERC
control of the wires could force state regulators out of the electric
sector altogether--because without some piece of the distribution network
to regulate, state regulators would have no leverage over the industry--no
peg to hang rules on.
   In New Orleans, at the mid-November Naruc annual convention, all five
FERC commissioners came to meet the gathered state regulators face-to-face,
to discuss the controversial issue in a historic first-of-a-kind meeting.
Although one participant compared the session to the Bosnian peace talks,
the atmosphere was cordial. FERC Chairman Elizabeth Moler made clear it
from the start that the object of the meeting was to cooperate and find
``practical and workable'' solutions to issues posed by changes in the
industry--which neither side had full control over.

Legally defensible
   Moler assured attendees that the states, not FERC, would make key
decisions on electric power industry restructuring and deregulation, and
that the jurisdictional issue would not be ignored. Any final plan for
splitting jurisdiction had to be ``legally defensible,'' she warned, or
else it would invite utility lawsuits that would lead to long,
non-productive court battles.
   But that introduction still left wide open the key question of who
actually will have authority over the electric system if restructuring goes
forward and distribution service is unbundled. The FERC commissioners said
they had no intention of staging a ``power grab'' and taking over the
entire system--even though under some legal interpretations they probably
could. Not all attendees agreed. ``It's impossible to see how the states do
not have authority,'' said Texas Public Utility Commissioner Robert Gee.
``FERC jurisdiction is clearly limited to wholesale transmission and
matters not subject to regulation by the states.''
   The federal commissioners said that they expected to retain a major role
in regulating any wires that carry power considered in ``interstate
commerce.'' Unfortunately, in the new deregulated industry, where retail
customers may buy directly from generation companies across the country,
virtually all power can be considered to be ``in interstate commerce,'' and
therefore FERC could have a claim on virtually all wires.
   FERC General Counsel Susan Tomasky said that the commission had put out
the language in the Mega NOPR to try and provide some sort of a definition
for what the federal law required. But FERC now realizes that it has to
work with the states to ``get the issue right.''

The last inch
   Speaking for Naruc, Vermont Public Service Board Chairman Richard Cowart
asserted that the states should remain in control of any part of the
distribution system that functions to serve retail users--no matter where
the power came from. Under such a plan, a clear line would be drawn around
each utility's retail service area and the states would regulate inside
that boundary, whether the power was coming bundled from the local company
or unbundled from the outside via a retail wheeling arrangement.
   The key, said Cowart, would be that the wires would carry out a ``local
distribution'' function, meeting the test in the Federal Power Act for
state jurisdiction. The FERC commissioners, however, worried that such an
approach would lead to a ``Balkanization'' of the national power market,
especially if different states took radically different approaches to
restructuring electric markets.
   FERC Commissioner Donald Santa noted that the commission was trying to
be non-intrusive. He said FERC wants to give states elbow room to determine
how to restructure their local electric industries and handle key
issues--such as stranded investment recovery. But he added that FERC would
still have to provide the electric power industry with a backstop and
``fill in the gap if the states fail.''
   Finally, FERC Commissioner William Massey asked the state commissioners
to consider a practical approach in which FERC regulated interstate retail
transactions, but guaranteed states control over some piece of the
distribution system. But what piece? ``How much do you need?'' Massey
asked. ``Will the last inch do?''

Worst of both worlds?
   After some head scratching, the state commissioners said that they
wanted the last inch for sure, but giving FERC a major say in regulating
retail transactions still raised major concerns. According to Iowa
Utilities Board Member Emmit George, it could be difficult to load up that
last inch with charges for conservation programs, renewable energy,
low-income programs, and stranded-investment recovery. At the same time,
George commented, ``the real challenge'' is to insure that the last inch
applies to all situations and therefore, the charges would be
non-bypassable and equitably shared by all customers.
   But Wayne Shirley, chairman of the New Mexico Public Utility Commission
(PUC), claimed that the problem goes beyond the ``last inch,'' noting that
if most state regulation is handed over to a federal jurisdiction, then
local interests could get lost in the shuffle. For example, New Mexico
electricity users would face a more expensive process to have their case
heard by less responsive regulators in Washington.
   What's more, Renz Jennings, chairman of the Arizona Corporate
Commission, pointed out FERC's lack of expertise with environmental issues
compared to state commissions' work on plant siting issues, resource
selection, and use of conservation and renewables. By ceding control of the
electric system to federal jurisdiction ``we may wind up with the worst of
both worlds,'' commented Jennings. ``FERC will move in to assert its
authority but at the same time back away from environmental stewardship.''

Leave it to FERC
   The New Orleans debate did not settle anything, but instead, actually
highlighted the intense, though friendly, game of tug-of-war now being
played out between the state and federal regulatory groups over the
nation's electric system. The two sides quickly declared the attempt at
dialogue a smashing success and said they hoped to continue the process as
soon as possible.
   If it did anything, the debate underscored the contradictory and almost
bizarre situation facing state regulators. As political power shifts away
from Washington to the states, state commissions should be exercising the
power they retain under federal law to regulate local utilities with less
federal interference--not more. But the dynamics of electric power industry
restructuring, and the physics of electricity, seem to be working against
this.
   Right now, it simply seems more efficient to do away with state
regulation of retail transmission and declare all electricity part of a
single national market under federal regulation. Besides the technical
arguments about freedom of interstate commerce and electron flows, there is
FERC's practical experience in dealing with wholesale transmission tariffs.
State commissions in the existing system do not see retail transmission
tariffs because they are bundled with power sales costs and have always
been an invisible part of ratemaking.
   The ``leave it to FERC'' concept was supported by a proposal submitted
in July by the Electric Consumers Resource Council (Elcon), a
Washington-based trade association representing large industrial users. One
upshot of the Elcon plan was to effectively kick state regulators out of
the electric arena once and for all. Ironically, if total deregulation of
the electric sector happens, a majority of utility executives say that they
would prefer that FERC have control of the wires because FERC is on record
as favoring recovery of stranded investment costs--and has approved such
arrangements for deals among wholesale buyers and sellers.
   State regulators, on the other hand, who are directly elected by
ratepayers or appointed by governors, are at best lukewarm about shifting
the whole cost of stranded assets to customers.

Regulators or referees?
   As state legislators openly question the need for regulators in an age
of deregulation, many attendees at the New Orleans conference were
understandably nervous about what they will be doing five years from now.
While most believe there still will be a valid need for public utility
commissions after year 2000, they tend to believe their functions will
change greatly. Instead of regulating monopolies, state commissioners
expect to be refereeing markets and acting as ``gatekeepers,'' deciding who
will participate in the local electric power business and on what terms.
   State commissions probably will also spend more time policing
utilities--which will become more bottom-line oriented. Instead of rate
regulation, prudency reviews, and dissecting integrated resource plans, the
key functions of PUC staffs will become consumer protection, determining
access to markets, and antitrust enforcement.
   In a nutshell, said Illinois Commerce Commission chairman Daniel Miller,
regulators will have to ``know how to establish the ground rules for
competition and choice, while still protecting consumers against undue
market power.'' According to Robert Anderson, a member of the Montana
Public Service Commission and outgoing president of Naruc, ``Ten or 15
years ago, state regulators were for the status quo. Now we feel that if
deregulation can be introduced it is better than regulation.''
   While the state commissioners have a general idea of where they are
going, the discussions in New Orleans showed that, at least in the
electricity sector, there are still plenty a questions about how to get
there--and the jurisdictional tussle with FERC is just one issue.
   Kenneth Gordon, former chair of the Massachusetts Dept of Public
Utilities warned that regulators face a difficult change of mindset going
from reliance on political and administrative processes to reliance on
competition and markets. He said state regulators could fall into a
``schizophrenia syndrome'' in which they were split between the conflicting
goals of opening up markets and continuing to pursue social policies. As a
result, they could be tempted into ``fooling with prices'' which would
frustrate the move to free markets.

Transparent to customers
   The ``public utility concept''--which includes support for energy
conservation and renewable energy programs, while allowing new market
forces to exist--is ideal, although only attainable in the long term. In
the short term, some state commissions, which are lobbied by strong
conservation and environmental groups, have been reluctant to simply drop
such programs as a price for electric power industry restructuring.
   Instead, the regulators have begun to look seriously at imposing
universal service charges on all retail customers to provide a source of
funding for the programs that previously were lumped into general utility
rates. This is a key reason why the commissioners want to hold onto their
``last inch'' of wire and retain some option to control revenue flows--even
as traditional utility ratemaking fades out.
   But no one knows whether average consumers will want to pay for social
programs, especially if the up to $10 per month charge suddenly becomes
very easy to find on the monthly electric bills. In the old system, nobody
liked to give utilities rate increases, but the economic justifications for
the hikes were so arcane that the public wound up with little sense of why
things were happening. This actually gave commissions much more leeway to
order programs with high pricetags.
   By unbundling rates, costs become naked and regulators will have to get
used to justifying any decision that affects pocketbooks. In fact, another
major challenge to the state regulators will be to refocus their main
attention on customers after spending years carefully balancing the
interests of regulated utilities and customers--and frequently
overprotecting the utilities.

Add value to regulation
   According to Daniel Fessler, president of the California PUC, the most
critical job of regulators will be to design delivery mechanisms that
ensure the benefits of the competitive market flow to the small users.
Government will not need to protect the interests of the ``large, strong,
and articulate players in the market,'' he told the convention, and it
should not just stand back and assume that benefits of competition will
``trickle down'' to all users. ``If government has any role at all, it is
to guard the interests for those who are too busy, too preoccupied, too
small, or too politically insignificant to achieve what the more fortunate
are able to achieve.''
   Fessler noted that with the ``appetite for government solutions at an
all time low,'' regulators had to find some way to ``add value'' to the
process. Of course, the first and most important test of this new consumer
orientation may be the coming battle over stranded investment where, says
Montana's Anderson, ``the irresistible [forces of the market] meet the
immovable object of utility stranded-investment costs'' now estimated at
about $135-million nationwide.

Stranded stockholders
   The main question already on the table in California, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, and several other states is how to restructure their electric
industries. The real issue driving that question is whether utility
stockholders will be compensated for former investments, or whether
consumers will pick up the tab and pay high upfront charges for a
transition period before the promised benefits of retail choice emerge. The
issue is further complicated because the obvious ways to collect the funds
are either through a universal service charge on distribution utilities, to
be based on the ``final inch''; or in the near term, utility
retail-wheeling tariffs. In both cases, the state/federal jurisdiction
issue immediately presents itself.
   So far, commissioners have been very cautious about giving utilities a
blank check to receive all stranded costs. In some states, such as Maine
and New Hampshire, commissions have proposed a 50% recovery as a sort of
holding maneuver. But anything short of 100% recovery has usually incurred
the political wrath of local utilities.
   The preferred approach, so far, has been to put off as long as possible
any final decision by state officials on the issue. Or--better yet--let the
parties directly involved negotiate a deal on how much stranded investment
recovery will be allowed.
   At the New Orleans convention, the question revolved more around whether
commissions and state legislatures, which order electric power industry
restructuring, might duck the stranded-investment issue altogether, thereby
insuring ratepayers would get the full benefit of the free market at once.
   In such places as California and New England, where above-market
investment in nuclear plants and independent-power contracts have pushed
rates up far above the national average and alternative market rates for
power are considered ``dirt cheap,'' the temptation for regulators to let
the utilities absorb the losses is great.

Absolute authority will fade
   Another issue to resolve will be how much control state commissions will
retain over the energy supply portfolio available to electric users in
their state. In simpler days, when most utilities built powerplants in
their territory and sold electricity to local users, PUCs wielded
significant power in determining if new capacity was needed, where plants
should be built, and what fuel to use. Then, as integrated resource
planning, federal rules supporting non-utility generation, and
environmental concerns came into play during the last 20 years, the power
was expanded until many PUCs had absolute authority over the shape of the
state electric system.
   However, such powers seriously eroded by the 1990s, as overbuilding of
generating units and the sparse market for new independent power meant
decisions on new capacity were less important. Also, commissions have begun
backing away from resource planning rules as the competitive market now
makes decisions for utility management, and incentive-based conservation
programs have lost their allure.
   In the proposed new market system, the notion of states building up
their local resource portfolios will be all but obsolete, as electricity
will be offered from resources on a nationwide or regional basis. The job
of the state commissions will be more to decide who will be allowed to sell
power in the state, and not make decisions on where power will be
generated. State commissioners will suddenly have to pay more attention to
policies of surrounding states and understand what larger markets and
regional grids their indigenous utilities operate in. This presents major,
new opportunities for cooperation--but also conflict.
   In New England, for example, where there is a tradition of regional
cooperation on electricity issues, strong restructuring drives in
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island are forcing the other states
to consider moving quicker than planned. At the same time, in New
Hampshire, political leaders supporting restructuring declare that they do
not want to tie their actions to a slower regional effort and delay moving
to lower power rates that could help the state compete economically with
its neighbors.

Required reciprocity
   Another emerging problem is whether states will require reciprocity in
regulating electricity sellers based in each other's state--and how states
will ensure that local power isn't replaced by cheaper out-of-state
supplies based on lower environmental standards?
   Also, the basic question seems to be: How will restructuring actions in
each state--splitting up the generation, transmission, and distribution
businesses--be accomplished? Through ``functional'' unbundling that leaves
the large utility structures intact, or through an actual break up of
utilities into smaller companies. And, what types of organizations will do
what jobs? Will exiting utilities continue to own transmission, or will the
grid be run by an independent operator? Will generation be sold directly to
end users or be channeled through a poolco which would protect smaller
users from the uncertainties of direct competition? This last issue has
already generated a furious debate in California and held up progress on
restructuring for over a year.

A new antitrust role
   State regulators say such issues amount to the first major step in
carrying out their new antitrust or ``competition policeman'' role. How
each state sets up its playing field and how much integration each leaves
between the parts of the electric system may have a lot to do with
determining how much time and effort each state will spend in the future as
a policeman.
   Already, states completing retail competition tests are wrestling with
whether to allow a franchised utility to provide energy to its own
customers--or whether this creates an unfair advantage.
   Cheryl L. Parrino, chair of the Wisconsin Public Service Commission and
newly elected president of Naruc, told the group that while the antitrust
approach is less pervasive than the old rate-regulation approach, it comes
with the ``heavy hammer'' of possible criminal penalties. She notes that
many state commissions have already gained antitrust experience controlling
the relationship of their still-regulated electric utilities with
non-regulated affiliates, and that this issue will become increasingly
important as competitive lines of business grow.
   Parrino added that the state commissions should realize that unlike
traditional antitrust enforcement by state and federal legal officials,
which seeks to remove barriers to free competition, utility commissions
took a more positive antitrust role of structuring the industry and markets
to allow free competition. But, she warned that utilities also must realize
that they will no longer be protected by regulation, and will therefore be
much more vulnerable on antitrust issues.

Move to a national market
   At the New Orleans meeting, several officials on both sides reiterated
that a dual state/federal approach to handling transmission issues would
work better than holding endless debates to define a clear boundary between
jurisdictions. State representatives noted that in the past, FERC and the
states had found ways to split responsibilities.
   For example, FERC created a general regime for determining avoided costs
under the 1978 Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act, and each state
then adopted its own system for setting local avoided costs and authorizing
utility contracts with non-utility generators.
   The New Hampshire PUC--which has little time for debate because it wants
a retail wheeling pilot program in place by May--has floated a plan under
which utilities would voluntarily file retail transmission tariffs to both
the PUC and FERC. Then, each agency would take whatever action on the
proposed tariffs that it believed necessary.
   At the same time, New Hampshire PUC chairman Douglas Patch has suggested
that eventually, mixed boards of federal and state officials could be used
for dealing with the retail transmission issue.

B&W RINGS IN THE NEW YEAR WITH BIG CONTRACTS

   With work just starting on approximately $420-million in new powerplant
contracts, Babcock & Wilcox Co (B&W), Power Generation Group, is ringing in
1996 with good cheer and moving full steam ahead. Recent awards from the
Egyptian Electricity Authority and Sumitomo Corp (Tokyo, Japan) account for
the company's renewed optimism. ``While the market has remained fairly
stable for the past 10 years, B&W continues to increase its international
market share,'' explains Walter E. Boomer, president of B&W Power
Generation Group. ``These contracts reflect the steady progression of our
overseas activities.''
   Egyptian Electricity Authority issued the newest contract award for
steam generating equipment for the new Sidi Krir and Ayoun Moussa
powerplants. Scope of supply for B&W is two 320-MW gas/oil-fired boilers
and accessories. Additionally, in conjunction with Nuova Cimimontubi, an
Italian construction firm, B&W will supply the balance-of-plant, erection,
and construction services. B&W's share of the contract is valued at about
$120-million.
   Steam drums will be manufactured in North America; the remainder of the
boiler units will be fabricated at Babcock & Wilcox Egypt, a joint venture.
Contracts set the completion of the Sidi Krir units in September 1998 and
March 1999. The Ayoun Moussa units are scheduled for completion about a
year later.
   Under the terms of the Sumitomo contract, B&W will supply two 660-MW
coal-fired boilers for the Tanjung Jati B powerplant in central Java,
Indonesia. B&W will be responsible for about 33% of the total powerplant
project, valued at about $900-million. Scope of supply for B&W, beyond the
boilers and accessories, includes electrostatic precipitators and a
complete wet flue-gas desulfurization system to meet Indonesian
environmental standards. Work on the Sumitomo contract is split between P.
T. Babcock & Wilcox Indonesia (a local B&W subsidiary) and B&W's North
American facilities. Contract completion is set for 1998.

INSIDE UTILITY MERGERS: TRENDS WITHIN THE TREND

By:
Cate Jones

   If you're an electric-utility executive, you probably understand why the
expression ``May you live in interesting times,'' is a curse--not a
salutation. The present is indeed an interesting time for the industry, as
federal and state authorities prepare to deregulate parts of the business
and replace guaranteed service territories with free-market competition.
   Already, anticipation of deregulation has increased the number of
utility mergers, as companies scramble to improve their competitive
positions. According to Doug Kimmelman, vice president of the Utility Group
of Goldman, Sachs & Co, New York, NY, top managers of virtually every
utility in the US are discussing mergers as a competitive strategy within
their companies, and many have extended the discussions to include
prospective merger partners.
   ``There is sufficient anecdotal evidence to suggest that many utilities
are looking very hard at other companies to calculate the best mesh of
staff exchange, operating practices, management of assets, and so forth,''
says M. Douglas Dunn, partner and chair of the Utilities Practice of
Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, New York, NY. Dunn adds that merger
negotiations often result when top executives of two utilities discover
that they have a similar ``strategic vision,'' or long-range plans. Such
was the case with the PSI Resources/Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co (CG&E)
deal, he says. Dunn expects today's frenzied pace to continue for a while.
How frenzied is it now? ``Right now,'' Dunn quips, ``if you call early in
the week, you get a better date on Saturday night.''
   As for the future, many pundits are predicting that more ``mergers of
equals'' will take place. Typically, such marriages combine the assets of
low-cost producers, yielding economies of scale that reduce costs even more
and give the newlyweds a competitive edge in the wholesale power market.
Low-cost producers often seek out partners with lower production costs
and/or better growth prospects. Today, it remains to be seen whether
high-cost power producers will even be able to get a date on New Year's
Eve.

The trigger event
   Mergers--and utility mergers in particular--are extremely complex
business transactions requiring ``hundreds of different moving parts to
mesh,'' notes Kimmelman. Only about 30% of the mergers that Kimmelman's
group works on ever succeed, which proves how tenuous and sensitive mergers
are, just as business deals. What's more, mergers within highly regulated
industries--such as electric power--require the approval of state, federal,
and even local authorities--a process that often takes 18 months or longer
to complete, says Clifford M. Naeve, a partner with Skadden Arps Slate
Meagher & Flom, Washington, DC, and a former Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) commissioner.
   Why the recent spate of utility mergers? Lawrence J. Makovich, associate
director of Cambridge (Mass) Energy Research Associates (CERA), contends
that the mergers' watershed event came in April 1994, when California
regulators proposed a retail-wheeling scheme that would allow customers to
bypass their local utilities and buy power directly from market suppliers.
The boldness and scope of the proposal sent shock waves through the
industry, says Makovich, because it sent a message that not only was
competition more likely, but that it was also likely to arrive sooner than
expected. Many utility executives came to the conclusion that, if
deregulation were to be imposed on a fast-track schedule, they couldn't
improve their utility's competitive position fast enough to survive without
the help of a partner.

Illusion or driver?
   On the surface, the motivation for most mergers is the promise of cost
saving and operating synergies that will benefit utilities and
shareholders. Most industry observers agree that potential cost savings are
the primary driver, and are necessary for regulatory approval--particularly
by FERC. But other rationales are used to cement deals between two
utilities (see box, p 60).
   Makovich argues that looking for cost saving is nothing new, and may
even be an illusion. Reducing costs through manpower and operating
synergies, he claims, cannot produce significant results because those
areas represent such a small portion of current operating costs. He
contends that manpower, for example, typically represents 5% of the
operating costs at a utility, so a 10% reduction of 5% of a utility's costs
can make, at best, a tiny impact on its cost structure.
   On the other hand, fuel costs at, say, a coal-fired plant typically
account for the lion's share of that plant's total costs, with capital
costs accounting for the remainder. Makovich postulates that the the real
strategic reasons for mergers are the following factors, each of which
helps determine utility cost structures in a competitive environment:
   -- Diversification of the fuel mix for power generation. Under
regulation, fuel-adjustment clauses are used to transfer fuel-price risks
to customers--but that tool won't be available under competition.
Accordingly, some mergers aim to shift price risks back to producers by
improving fuel diversity--seeking a merger partner who feeds different
fuels to his stable of powerplants.
   -- Undervalued assets, the flip side of stranded assets. Some utilities
have largely depreciated, low-cost generating units that will be worth more
than their current rate-based value in a competitive environment (EW,
November 1995, p 46). Mergers allow acquisition of such assets before an
upward competitive evaluation can take place.
   -- Transmission and distribution (T&D) systems. It is still unclear how
utilities will be compensated for use of their T&D systems for retail
wheeling. However, mergers are a way of stocking up on an unknown but
potentially valuable commodity: grid miles.
   Makovich further contends that if wholesale competition does not play
out as expected, then many predicted merger benefits will not materialize.

Puhca revisited
   One interesting trend in the recent electric-utility mergers (see table)
has been greater use of the registered holding company structure by the
merging parties. As Sheldon Adler, a partner with Skadden Arps, points out,
at one time the structure was in disfavor because it imposed another level
of regulation on the merged entity.
   According to Naeve, Adler's colleague at Skadden Arps, the 1935 Public
Utility Holding Company Act (Puhca) permits three corporate structures
under which utilities can merge. The first and simplest--because it avoids
regulation under Puhca--is an organization without a holding company at the
top. That was the tack that the PacifiCorp/Utah Power & Light Co and
Midwest Energy Inc/Iowa-Illinois Gas & Electric Co mergers took.
   The second structural option that merging utilities have is to create an
exempt holding company, making the merged entity exempt from most Puhca
requirements. However, the guidelines for that option are quite stringent.
For example, if an intrastrate exempt holding company--a so-called 3(a)(1)
company--is set up in a state, all of the utility subsidiaries which
provide more than 5% of the holding company's income must be incorporated
in that state, and derive at least 80% of their income from customers
within the state.
   PSI Energy Inc, before its merger with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co
(CG&E), was a 3(a)(1) exempt company. Setting up a 3(a)(2) exempt holding
company, on the other hand, requires only that the holding company be
predominantly a utility, and that its utility subsidiaries provide no more
than 20% of its revenues. Before merging with PSI, CG&E was a 3(a)(2)
exempt company.
   The third option is the registered holding company, which is subject to
strict regulation by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC)--including
prohibitions on electric-utility ownership of significant natural-gas
properties. Although CG&E had gas properties when it merged with PSI, the
two utilities chose to do so by creating a registered holding
company--CINergy Corp--because they correctly anticipated that the SEC
would relax some of its strict ownership requirements.

Holding on to holding companies
   After the CG&E/PSI merger raised the collective industry opinion of
registered holding companies, more mergers--some of which would not have
occurred otherwise--took a similar approach. While the option is often not
utilities' first choice, because it still incurs burdensome regulations,
establishing a registered holding company does have several advantages.
Most important, it gives the merged companies more flexibility to operate
over state lines. At the same time, the umbrella holding company also
provides a vehicle for the merging utilities to maintain their identities
and brand recognition among customers and concerned shareholders. Finally,
the holding-company structure is proving to be one of the best ways for
number-crunchers to pin down assets and costs, points out Dunn. The
Northern States Power Co/Wisconsin Electric Power Co, Public Service Co of
Colorado/Southwestern Public Service Co, and the Wisconsin Power & Light
Co/IES Industries Inc/ Interstate Power Co mergers all involved the
establishment of a registered holding company.
   ``The CG&E/PSI deal created the template for all future mergers of
equals,'' says Adler, whose Skadden Arps represented PSI, while Milbank,
Tweed acted on behalf of CG&E. The lawyers and utility executives produced
an evenhanded merger document that contemplates everything from the
companies' representation on the board of directors to succession issues.
Inability to establish succession plans has caused more than one merger to
fail, according to Kimmelman. Edward Tirello, senior vice president for
equities research at Natwest Market Securities, New York, NY, believes that
the succession issue is even more key: He claims that the US electric power
industry is ``being held hostage by 300 people. It is the only industry
where the corporate officers don't hold stock.''
   Establishing a succession plan was only one reason why the CG&E/PSI
merger succeeded, says Dunn. Here are some others:
   -- The managements of the two utilities shared the same strategic
vision, and each was convinced that the other was the most-logical
partner.
   -- The merger allowed both companies to minimize their risks, as well
as explore emerging technologies, such as fuel cells.
   -- The characteristics of the two utilities' service territories were
complementary--excess generating capacity, but promise of growth in PSI's,
and restricted growth in CG&E's backyard.

Balancing capacity and demand
   Balancing demand growth and generating capacity is a common strategy in
mergers. According to Adler and Naeve, little saving on the generation side
is possible if both utilities are already in the same energy pool--although
substantial savings can still be realized. But if one company has most of
its demand peaks in the winter peak demands and the other in the summer
peak, generating profiles would dovetail nicely. That approach has a big
fan in Kimmelman, who says it makes sense for utilities in the North, where
there typically is excess capacity but low demand growth, to seek partners
in the South, where there is less capacity but higher growth. Of course,
the southern utility could also make the first move.
   The three-way merger between Wisconsin Power & Light, IES Industries,
and Interstate Power Co exemplifies the balancing approach: Because the
merged utilities will have a service territory that surrounds, on the north
and west, that of high-cost Unicom, the merger will let the new partners
take better advantage of wholesale power markets. As Dunn, who represented
Interstate Power in the negotiations, points out, mergers have changed the
role of utility executives from its traditional custodial nature to one
that demands dynamic management of assets.

Controlling the channels
   If the history of other deregulated industries tells us anything about
the potential effect of competition on the electricity sector, it is that
bigger will be better. Whenever companies have been forced to compete,
``larger companies have historically fared better, because they are able to
survive the discounting that inevitably results in the battle for
customers,'' says Kimmelman. And since distribution is the business that is
closest to customers, he adds, acquiring more distribution channels will
become increasingly important, and the objective of future mergers.
   Certainly, expansion of distribution was in mind during negotiation of
the Southwestern Public Service Co (SPS)/Public Service Co of Colorado
(PSCo) merger--the first between utilities with non-contiguous service
territories. After a high-voltage interconnecting transmission line is
built when the ink is dry on the merger documents, the as-yet unnamed
holding company will have one of the largest service territories in the
US.

Expanding business opportunities
   With many utilities experiencing anemic domestic earnings, mergers may
also provide an opportunity to expand business opportunities. Here again,
bigger is better because you need a large balance sheet in order to
diversify. Merger partners may be considered for their successful
unregulated earnings growth, or for their ventures outside of the core
business. The rationale for the SPS/PSCo merger included some of those
elements. In addition to having a faster-growing service economy, PSCo had
natural-gas operations, and innovative information-technology and
energy-services programs. SPS was not only strong in power generation,
engineering, and fuels diversity, but it also had a subsidiary, Quixx Corp,
which is involved in a several successful non-utility power generation
(NUG) projects, both in the US and overseas.

The shape of things to come
   Mergers are definitely reshaping the utility landscape. While the
industry consensus is that FERC will require utilities to unbundle
themselves into separate generation, transmission, and distribution
companies, no one can yet say when that will happen.
   But some are already guessing what the structure of the new industry
will look like. NatWest's Tirello, who lightly refers to himself as a
visionary, foresees extreme consolidation that will produce, once the dust
settles, only nine regional energy holding companies in the US.
   According to Tirello, each ``superutility'' will have: three to five
generating subsidiaries; separate transmission and distribution entities;
and companies that will offer a wide range of communications
services--cable TV, voice and data links, security hookups, etc--to
consumers. The way he sees it, electricity will be a low-margin commodity,
distribution will remain regulated by states, generation will be lightly
regulated--if at all--and independent power producers will sell power to
the big energy companies, signaling the beginning of the end for merchant
plants. But Kimmelman disagrees, saying that although the industry will
continue to consolidate, Tirello's vision is too extreme. One reason it
won't happen, Kimmelman explains, is the difficulty of closing a merger
deal--something he has learned first-hand, in the trenches.

Top 10 rationales for successful mergers
   According to Doug Kimmelman of Goldman, Sachs, New York, NY--which
consulted on four of the six mergers announced during 1995--there are 10
rationales underlying current and future mergers. The first five are
critical; they are common to all utility mergers to date, and will likely
be common to all future mergers. All or some of the next five rationales,
although not critical, have been and will be part of past, present, and
future mergers.

The five critical rationales:
   1. Cost reductions and improving competitive position. Federal and state
approvals are required before a merger can be finalized, and the merger
must demonstrate it is good for ratepayers and competition.
   2. Earnings enhancements through synergies. Being able to reduce
internal costs through synergies is a plus to shareholders.
   3. Diversification of business, to minimize risk. Included here are
efforts to expand the utilities retail and industrial customer base, spread
the business risks resulting from regulation over several states, and widen
the mix of generation fuels.
   4. Enhancing size. Bigger will be better under competition, and bigger
numbers on the bottom of balance sheets will support more-diverse
investment strategies.
   5. Solving succession issues. All successful mergers to date have had a
well-defined management-succession plan.

The five less critical rationales for mergers:
   1. To reduce vulnerability to an unwanted takeover.
   2. To lower a utility's dividend profile.
   3. To offset exposure to stranded-investment risk, by blending and
averaging the risk of stranded assets.
   4. To achieve premium valuations. Because many electric-utility stocks
are overvalued, mergers can achieve a premium valuation for shareholders at
the cost of a slight loss of control.
   5. To assess higher growth, unregulated ventures. Given today's weak
outlook for domestic earnings growth in regulated businesses, it makes
sense for utilities to try to enter unregulated energy businesses or make
equity investments overseas, where growth--and, unfortunately, risk--are
potentially higher.

WHY UTILITY BOARD MEMBERSHIP IS CHANGING

By:
Marie Leone

   How do electric-utility boards compare to the boards of the nation's
largest corporations? To start, electric utility boards are younger, less
highly compensated, and have a greater outside representation than other
large US companies. In addition, utility board members have a shorter
tenure, and fewer utility companies offer stock options than their
corporate counterparts in the private sector. This information comes from
Spencer Stuart's (Houston, Tex) first survey of electric--utility boards.
   Spencer Stuart, an executive search firm, has created its annual Spencer
Stuart Board Index (SSBI) by surveying the boards of 100 leading publicly
traded US companies--including firms such as AT&T Corp, Exxon Corp, and IBM
Corp. Now, the firm has created a utility board index (UI)--the first
industry-specific survey that Spencer Stuart has conducted. Jonathan A.
Crystal, a partner with the firm, expects the UI to become an annual
offering and predicts that many utility boards will change significantly in
the coming years as the economic climate for utilities grows more
competitive.

Turnover expected
   For example, Crystal says that, over the next five years, board-member
turnover will be higher at electric utilities than in other types of
companies. Why? Utilities are moving away from their local business focus,
he says. By ``local,'' Crystal refers to utilities' traditional
``semi-public'' obligation, which is usually manifest from the
representation on the board of local corporations, businesses,
not-for-profit organizations, universities and hospitals. That's different
from companies in the SSBI group, whose goal is to serve stockholders, not
the community. Essentially, Crystal explains, the monopoly structure of the
electric-utility industry made the utility business local in nature.
   However, as deregulation forces utilities beyond their local roots,
board makeups will likewise move beyond local representation. In fact,
Crystal believes that more international, marketing, and financial experts
will become part of utility boards as US utilities look to increase
earnings growth in domestic and international markets.

Changing times, changing data
   According to Spencer Stuart's inaugural UI report, the average tenure of
board members is 8.1 years, and ranges from 13.3 to one year. Ten boards
(20%) averaged over 10 years of service, and 10 averaged less than six
years of service.
   Other survey data say that the average age of a UI director is 59, vs 61
for an SSBI director. The latter average has been constant at 61 for the
past six years. But Crystal says that the 2-yr age spread does not reflect
the whole story, because the age group dispersion of UI and SSBI directors
is further apart than the average would indicate. For example, only 42% of
utility-board directors have an average age over 60, as compared to 78% of
the SSBI boards.
   In 1994, UI boards had a 5:2 ratio of directors that came from outside
the utility company to directors that worked for the utility. This compares
favorably to SSBI boards, which had four outside directors for each inside
director. Thirteen UI boards (26%) included the CEO as the only insider, as
compared to 14% of the SSBI boards. UI boards averaged two inside directors
vs three for SSBI boards.
   In addition, 25 of the 50 UI boards offered stock options and/or grants
to outside directors in 1994. That number increased to 27 by 1995. Those
figures compare to 56 SSBI boards in 1994, and 61 in 1995. Crystal
comments that there is a movement afoot in corporate America to require
directors to buy stocks when joining a company's board, so that their
economic interests are more closely aligned with those of stockholders.

Compensation considered
   In the area of compensation, the average total cash compensation for UI
directors is also markedly less than the compensation of the directors
included in the SSBI survey. The results say that 74% of the UI boards pay
less $40,000 per year, compared to 10% of the broader survey of major US
companies. UI board compensation ranges from a low of $18,785 at Hawaiian
Electric Industries Inc to a high of $58,622 at Public Service Gas &
Electric Co (PSE&G). The only other utility paying less than $20,000 in
total director compensation annually is Illinova Corp, paying $18,800.
Three utilities other than PSE&G pay more than $50,000 to board members:
The Southern Company ($52,500); Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc
($51,500); and CMS Energy Corp ($51,444).
   Crystal says that the comparison between board compensation for the UI
group and SSBI group is simple economics. In general, utilities are smaller
companies, and therefore pay less. He notes that the UI index comprises the
50 largest US utilities in terms of revenue, which puts Pacific Gas &
Electric Co in the top spot with over $10.4-billion in revenue. This is a
far cry from some of the SSBI companies that take in more than $100-billion
in revenues each year.

THE 1995 JAMES H. MCGRAW AWARDS
`Industry is always ready for leadership' James H. McGraw, founder, The
McGraw-Hill Companies

   On November 29, Electrical World's 1995 James H. McGraw Awards were
presented to four electric-power companies to honor their pacesetting
industry achievements and significant contributions to the advancement of
the electric-power industry. Conferred upon the winners at a special
luncheon ceremony during McGraw-Hill's ``Globalization of Electricity
Markets'' executive summit, the awards were presented by Harold W. McGraw
Jr, chairman emeritus, The McGraw-Hill Companies, and grandson of the
company's founder.
   The winners--Duke Power Co (Charlotte, NC), Glasgow Electric Plant Board
(Glasgow, Ky), Nigen Ltd (Belfast, Ireland), and Sithe Energies Inc (New
York, NY)--were recognized for a diverse range of accomplishments and
innovations which included: the integration of strategic non-regulated
businesses with the utility operation; telecommunication service
innovation; creative financing; and competitive business practices.
   Significant about this year's winners is that they and their
achievements represent a departure from the domestic-based, utility-only
winners of the past. This year, two independent power companies were
honored--one based overseas. Also, each company was cited for achievements
that clearly extend beyond the traditional role of electric-power
companies. Thus, in keeping with its creator's philosophy, the 1995 McGraw
Awards, and Electrical World, continue to reflect the dynamic and evolving
electric-power industry and the issues important to the people that run its
businesses. Congratulations on a job well done.

Duke Power Co
   In recongnition of strategic and groundbreaking efforts to align utility
and non-utility activities with the competitive market.
   Duke Power's Associated Enterprises Group (AEG), formed in August 1994,
brings together eight of the corporation's non-utility business units,
thereby underscoring Duke's increased emphasis on its diversified segments
in a time of rapid change in the electric-power market.
   Through AEG, Duke Power is active in the: independent power business
(Duke Energy); the power marketing business (Duke/Louis Dreyfus); the
telecommunications sector (DukeNet Communications Inc); and worldwide
design, engineering, and construction (Duke Engineering & Services Inc and
Duke/Fluor Daniel.)
   In addition, the company ranks high in customer satisfaction, brand
loyalty, and operational excellence. Duke Power also is part of the team
now managing DOE's Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Systems program
and has assumed a principal role in the management and operation of DOE's
Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.

Nigen Ltd
   In recognition of financial innovation in a competitive market as
demonstrated by the Kilroot Electric Bond Offering.
   Presented with the challenge of a newly deregulated market and the
obstacle of raising funds needed to compete without sinking deep into
long-term bank debt, Nigen Ltd issued the $320-million Kilroot Electric
Bond Offering that completely replaced bank loans that the company took out
during its privatization.
   The bond issue--underwritten by Salomon Brothers and Barclays de Zoete
Wedd--was devised by the same group of in-house engineers who have run the
private power company since its inception, at the dissolution of the
state-owned Northern Ireland Electricity. The bond offering, a
first-of-its-kind in Europe, will not only free directors from the often
onerous day-to-day constraints of bank supervision, but will also speed the
day when employees at all levels can share in the company's success.
   Nigen, one of Northern Ireland's two main electric generating companies,
operates two plants in the region which produce close to half of the
province's electricity.

Sithe Energies Inc
   In recognition of the company's pioneering efforts in fostering
electric-power competition as demonstrated by the Independence project.
   From a business perspective, some industry experts claim that Sithe's
Independence project ushered in a new age of competition by initiating the
first retail-wheeling transaction using the yet untested 1992 Energy Policy
Act (EPAct). Others called it the last ``sweet'' deal for cogenerators.
But, the one thing all industry participants agreed on was that the
Independence project, located in Scriba, NY, near Lake Ontario, did, and
continues to, test the legal and regulatory framework of the new
competitive electric-power market in the US.
   By offering low-cost power from the Independence project, Sithe lured
away the local utility's largest customer--Alcan Rolled Products. Then, by
using the EPAct's open-access provision, Sithe obliged the utility to
provide transmission access from the Independence project to Alcan's
facility to complete the private-power transaction. Thus, Sithe forced
state and federal regulators to take a practical and realistic look at the
new law, and make decisions that will set precedents in the markeplace.

Glasgow Electric Plant Board
   In recognition of successful development and innovative commercial use
of a coaxial-based broadband network.
   The Glasgow Electric Plant Board already has its 13,000 customers better
linked to the world than most of the ``industry-leading'' organizations
still conducting small-scale pilots. Through its 120-total-mile, coax-based
communications network--that has drops to every location where the company
has a meter--GEPB has created a variety of cyber services that
strategically complement its electricity business.
   GEPB competes in the local cable television market and has, to date,
captured 55% of the area's customers; offers a second local telephone
utility service; connects customers to a city-wide computer data network
that links virtually every computer in Glasgow, including home, school,
city and county office, library, business, and medical facilities; offers
interactive television in local schools; owns and operates a fully
digitized geographic information system landbase of the county;
synchronizes all of the 22 traffic signals in the city; and can bundle all
available services on the coax network in one bill.

THE HISTORY

   An Electrical World tradition since 1925, the annual James H. McGraw
Awards, named for the founder of The McGraw-Hill Companies, are presented
to corporations and project owners and operators that have made a
significant contribution to the advancement of the electric power industry
through innovative and constructive business practices.
   In an excerpt from one of James McGraw's letters, he writes about the
award: ``I hope that it is well understood that the giving of this award is
purely symbolic. It would be manifestly impossible to attempt to make the
intrinsic worth of such an award indicate any measure of the importance or
the value of the service for which it is presented in commemoration. The
intent is rather to give public recognition and to express industry
appreciation of a contribution to the advancement of the electrical
industry which oftentimes may indicate and offer possibilities for good
beyond appraisal. The award is but a symbol of the honor that would come to
companies and their employees, who unselfishhly give of their time, their
thought, their energy, and their spirit to promote the interest of all the
electrical industry. Such companies and people the industry should indeed
delight to honor.''

HYDRO PACTS REVAMP OPERATIONS AND MARKET STRATEGIES

By:
Ray Pospisil

   As competition accelerates in the electricity sector, electric power
companies are looking to reap competitive benefits from their existing
hydroelectric powerplants--which provide low-cost power and reduce outlays
for air-pollution control equipment and strategies. However, most hydro
plants owned by investor-owned utilities are scheduled for relicensing over
the next two decades by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)--a
process that can take five to seven years, requires extensive studies, and
often involves contentious litigation--an ordeal that can dampen a hydro
project's market advantage.
20 But, with competitive forces nipping at their heels, hydro utilities
are working hard to avoid the delay and expense of the relicensing process.
And in some cases, to expedite the renewal process, utilities are reaching
settlements with environmental advocates, recreational groups, and public
agencies that change the way they operate powerplants.
20 ``When these projects were built in the early part of the century,
they were seen as engineering marvels. Now they're seen by some as
ecological disasters,'' says Cleve Kapala, director of relicensing for New
England Electric System (NEES). ``But we prefer to deal with constituencies
rather than depositions.''
   What are the realities of changes in operations? For one thing, such
changes often reduce generating output--if water is diverted away from
turbines to accommodate fish, for instance. In addition, greater flows may
be requested during off-peak periods, diminishing the value of these plants
as peakers and forcing utilities to generate power when market prices are
low. Lastly, the changes all cost money, and utilities are reluctant to
incur more costs at a time when they are trying to streamline to meet
competitive demands.
   And even though some utilities are willing to negotiate to keep their
plants out of the relicensing abyss, there remains at least one reported
case where a utility--Pacific Gas & Electric Co (PG&E)--decided to sell
some projects rather than absorb the extra costs associated with renewal of
the licenses.

A river view
   The most active conservation group in terms of hydroelectric issues is
American Rivers, based in Washington, DC, which has already worked out
settlements with Niagara Mohawk Power Corp (NiMo), NEES, and Central Maine
Power Co. American Rivers and other conservation groups are currently
working on settlements with other electric power companies in the US.
20 Margaret Bowman, director of hydropower programs, says the
organization usually fights for several key changes: increased flows,
rerouting of water to the bypass reaches (away from turbines), construction
of fish passage for migration, installing screens and other protective
devices to keep fish from getting sucked into turbines, and protection of
land around reservoirs.
20 ``Utilities are recognizing that the conditions we seek are required
by law, and are necessary for managing multiple uses of rivers,'' she says.
``By working with us, they can come to agreements that are win/win, rather
than going through a contentious process.'' Bowman says American Rivers and
other intervenors are making a greater effort to get involved early, rather
than waiting to formally intervene at FERC. ``If we have input into the
selection of the consultants that utilities use, we are less likely to
challenge their results and request more studies,'' she says. ``We don't
want utility money going into studies--we'd rather they spend it on
mitigation.''
   Early involvement by stakeholders and agencies is one of the key demands
that the National Hydropower Assn (NHA), Washington, DC, made in a petition
to FERC. NHA, which includes utilities, independent power producers, and
industrial hydro operators as members, notes that most of the relicensing
applications submitted to FERC in 1991 have still not been approved, and
that tens of thousands of megawatts of hydro power must be relicensed over
the next two decades.

A new pact
   Conservation groups, including American Rivers, recently signed onto a
settlement covering six NiMo dams on the Black River in New York, after
completing negotiations that involved the New York Dept of Conservation,
the US Fish & Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, New York Rivers
United, and others. Negotiations did not just resolve differences between
NiMo and intervenors, but settled other disagreements--often wildlife
interests do not always agree with boaters, who do not always want the same
flows as fishermen, who disagree among themselves about the merits of
rushing water vs standing pools. However, by the end, a settlement was
hammered out that will allow NiMo to submit its final application to FERC
without facing challenges by any of the interest groups or agencies.
   As part of the settlement, NiMo will contribute $105,000 to a Black
River restoration fund that includes over $1-million from this and earlier
settlements involving NiMo and the Watertown (NY) municipal powerplant.
NiMo has not yet calculated the cost of the alterations, but it has
estimated that generation will be reduced by 6%, according to a spokesman.
Some releases will also force the utility to operate turbines when it would
prefer to hold water back for later peaks.
20 Nevertheless, the changes could boost tourism and create economic
development benefits for the service territory, NiMo spokesmen note.
Altogether, the company is relicensing 30 plants under nine licenses,
accounting for about 700 MW, or 10% of its generation. NiMo has 20 staff
members working on relicensing and expects to spend $113-million on the
effort through the 1990s.
20 NEES will lose about 12% of the energy output of its Deerfield project
because of environmental and recreational changes, says Kapala. Over the
40-yr license that NEES is seeking, this could cause a revenue loss of
$21-million (net present value) from the series of eight dams that produce
85 MW. Part of that loss results from releasing water on weekends--when the
power is less valuable--in order to accommodate whitewater sports. In
addition, the company will spend $6- to $7-million on fish passage and
other improvements.
20 ``We have to anticipate the changing market, where all generation will
compete,'' he says. ``You don't want to strand environmental costs that
cannot be recovered.'' NEES decided to go ahead with these changes after
negotiating formally for two years and informally for two or three years
before that.
20 The value of the project as a peaker, and as a zero-emissions resource
were ``part of the overall calculus,'' Kapala says. He adds, however,
``There were some things we were asked to do that were just not
economically feasible.'' For instance, some environmental groups complained
that fluctuations in water storage affect wildlife habitats around the
reservoirs.
   But, a big advantage of the hydro dams is the utility's ability to
dispatch them for peaking power, and NEES refused to give up that benefit.
He adds that those reservoirs were built by NEES, and were never natural
formations.

West Coast water
   PacifiCorp is also trying to balance the costs of relicensing against
the benefits of its 1100-MW hydro system, says Terry Flores, hydro policy
administrator. ``The irony is that the costs to operate and relicense hydro
are increasing at the same time that the market is providing lower-cost
alternatives,'' she says. ``We are taking a hard look at the economics of
each project, but the process is not conducive to keeping costs down.
Licenses can be loaded up with so many conditions.'' She says government
agencies often see the licensing process as an opportunity to make
improvements for which they lack capital.
20 Flores also criticizes the process itself, saying too much money is
spent on studies, instead of going to protect or improve resources.
PacifiCorp has already spent $14-million to relicense a 185-MW project in
Oregon, yet most major issues remain unresolved, she notes. The company
also spent five years trying to relicense a 1-MW plant, but was recently
informed that FERC has no jurisdiction since the river is not navigable.
20 The cost of some environmental upgrades may be considered prohibitive.
PG&E recently agreed to sell two hydro plants that produce about 5 MW to
the Calaveras County Water District, citing the $6-million cost for
recreation upgrades required by the US Forest Service a major reason for
the sale. The company may seek to sell others, says a spokesman, adding,
``In the deregulated market, we won't be able to pass these costs along to
ratepayers.''
   That is also a concern for Southern California Edison Co (SCE), which
has 1156 MW of hydroelectric capacity. In the new market, hydro would be
the cheapest resource, but mitigation expenses could threaten that
advantage, notes SCE Biologist Geoffrey Rabone. The utility, which operates
in one of the most polluted air basins in the country, also relies heavily
on its hydro resources to hold down emissions, adds Ron Schroeder, manager
of relicensing and compliance. Therefore, the 10% reduction in power output
that he expects from settlements could affect the company's compliance
efforts.
20 Schroeder says that SCE's dams are ``high-head, low-flow'' units, for
which the drop is much greater--over 1000 ft in most cases, and up to 2400
ft--compared to eastern dams that are typically less than 50 ft high, but
with greater flow. Thus, flow changes have a bigger impact on the units.
20 In one settlement, SCE has reached an agreement with state and federal
agencies to spend $2.5-million on hatchery projects and other improvements
to ease relicensing of a 36-MW, run-of-the-river plant. However, a group
called the Kern River Valley Community Consensus Council wants the utility
to completely decommission the plant, saying the proposed improvements
cannot alleviate the impact to habitats and recreation.
Hydro's competitive edge
   Aside from zero fuel costs and zero emissions, hydroelectric power is
being touted in the competitive market for its storage ability.
Hydro-Quebec (H-Q) stresses storage in its power marketing efforts through
HQ Energy Services, Montreal, Que, Canada, comparing its 30,000-MW hydro
system to ``a big battery.'' This could allow utilities to keep plants
running at their most efficient, peak capacities and bank the excess for
later use. Utilities could also take advantage of swings in the market by
drawing down power and selling it when prices rise.
20 Further, H-Q sees a gradual merging of deregulated energy markets, so
that utilities or end users might shift between gas and purchased power
depending on prices. With that approach, power producers might generate

   Along with HQ Energy Services, H-Q is involved in Energy Alliance
Partnership (EAP), a power marketing joint venture that includes

20 A 10-second response
Mt Hope Hydro, Rockaway, NJ, is also offering the quick-dispatch
advantage--which will be possible when its proposed 2000-MW pumped-storage
project in New Jersey is completed. By quick dispatch, the project
developers mean within 10 seconds.
20 In addition to its dispatch capabilities, the project will also offer
power companies in the Northeast the chance to increase the amount of
inexpensive electricity they can import from Canada, say company sources.
That is because the quick availability would prevent inrushes of power if
generating plants are lost on the receiving end--therefore, utilities can
load their transmission lines closer to capacity. Mt Hope is a joint
venture of Kvaerner Inc of Norway, ABB Generation Inc, Littleton, Colo, and
other partners.

THE NAME GAME: A LEXICON FOR DISTRIBUTION

By:
L. Patrick Briody

   Here's a question for all the power company executives who are about to
enter the information technology age. What is the difference between
automatic meter reading (AMR) and automated meter reading? The answer is
not very obvious. One well-regarded utility industry researcher considers
the latter a subset of the former. In Chinese, automatic and automated are
the same word, Zi-Dong (self-move). Another researcher that publishes
in-depth reports at $875 a copy on the subject of AMR, defines it as
automatic meter reading. Has our focus on technology caused us to lose
focus on communications at a time when communicating with partners, power
brokers, industry colleagues has become paramount to surveying in a
competitive environment? If that is the case, here is an executive guide to
the next phase of distribution management--the technology that provides the
final, and vital, link between an electric power company and its customer.

What's the buzz?
   Since computers were first used in electric utilities, communication
between technical professionals and end users has been hampered by
imprecise terminology. Such miscommunication has largely been caused by the
different business perspectives of the two groups, the jargon of their
respective disciplines, and the over- and underlap of different
applications of information technology. Moreover, at times vendors have
clouded the issues to serve their own marketing purposes--a tactic referred
to as the ``muddy-the-waters marketing strategy.'' In addition,
interutility communications, which lacks the common organizational and
geographic context of an individual utility, are even more difficult.
Lastly, as the industry ``globalizes,'' translating already vaguely defined
terms seems destined to create a modern Tower of Babel.

A decoder ring
   According to Input, a research firm located in Mountain View, Calif,
the utility software and services market is growing at a 14% rate, second
only to telecommunications. Within utilities, the fastest growing
applications are clustered in the distribution operations side of the
house. They can be called collectively the ``distribution management
system.'' Because of the current focus on this area, defining these terms
precisely is more important than ever.
20 In an attempt to develop some measure of consistency in this area,
five leading utilities were examined to understand how they perceive
technology achieving their operational goals in distribution operations.
Their approaches to application integration were also probed. This
information was synthesized and a set of application definitions reflecting
a model of application relationships was developed.
20 The contributing utilities are Consolidated Edison Co of New York Inc
(Con Edison), Los Angeles Dept of Water & Power, Nevada Power Co (NPC),
Northern Indiana Public Service Co (Nipsco), and Southern California Edison
Co (SCE). They provided a cross-section of thought, from size, geographic,
and ownership viewpoints. All contributed unique perspectives. Con Edison
in particular is moving judiciously toward an automatic crew dispatch
application. SCE has implemented an innovative outage management system.

Keeping the lights on
   The phrase, distribution management system, is one of the more
misunderstood terms in the increasingly confused utility vocabulary. First,
its acronym, DMS, is so readily confused with the fading DSM (demand-side
management) as to degenerate many potentially constructive discussions into
bouts of arm waving as participants talk not over, not under, but around
one another's heads. Indeed, the two terms are intertwined in that both
imply some measure of control over the distribution network. However, DSM
implies influencing demand in order to balance it with supply, while DMS
simply implies assuring that the lights stay on. The term, DMS, taken
literally, clearly describes the overall responsibility of the distribution
operations organization. As a result, it is logically the umbrella-term for
distribution operations applications. The outage management line separating
power control and crew control also separates these application sets into
two different levels of capital intensity. Power control requires capital
investment in control facilities, while outage management, crew dispatch
and work management are basically software implementations.

Definitions
   The definitions in the box above represent a synthesis of the five
utilities participating in the technology definition effort. Despite their
many differences in organization and geography, it appears that all five
could talk to one another more precisely with this mini-lexicon. It divides
the distribution management system into its two aspects, power and service
(work). The power control center, which may co-reside with the service
control center, is distinct from a process standpoint. Its management of
the distribution network is through remote, real-time sensing and control.
In contrast, the service control center manages crews in the field.
20 The service side, or control center, uses a work management system for
both planned and unplanned (emergency) work. However, in emergencies, the
outage management system may provide many functions normally viewed as
``work management,'' for example: requesting work through isolating a
fault, designing by providing switching plans, or scheduling through direct
access to crew information within a crew dispatch function. The outage
management system is depicted as straddling the line between power and
service control centers, because its role is to bridge the real-time world
of power control to the slower world of work crews. Where outage management
feeds data on unplanned work into the work management system varies greatly
by each utility and its view of mopping up operations.

Whither GIS?
   Some will note the absence of AM/FM (automated mapping/facilities
management) and GIS (geographic information systems) from these
applications. This is quite deliberate. These terms, AM/FM/
GIS, have evolved from extensive efforts among utilities spanning a quarter
of a century to improve their capabilities to manage their distribution
facilities, the premise being that a single, geographically oriented data
base that includes connectivity of the electrical devices would be the
ultimate enabler of all distribution planning and operations.
20 As a data base, AM/FM/GIS is not an application per se. For this
reason, it is not included above. Generally, distribution operations folk
downgrade the importance of geographical accuracy in favor of electrical
connectivity. It is connectivity data that are fundamental to all
distribution operations applications. In the words of an NPC engineer: ``I
don't need to know where it is; they'll call me and tell me. I need to know
what it's connected to.'' Techniques for gleaning the necessary
connectivity data have improved markedly with Nipsco deriving connectivity
from scanned paper maps and generating one-line diagrams from those data.
SCE has derived connectivity from AutoCad (computer-aided distribution)
maps. The power applications group does not require a land data base. In
fact, their real-time performance requirements cannot be met by the typical
relational database management systems (RDMS)-based AM/FM/GIS data base. As
crew dispatch moves towards automatic, it uses geographic attributes in
locating and routing crews. Work management uses them in design and
scheduling. The good news is that after years of searching for the
AM/FM/GIS Holy Grail--conversion techniques--as well as graphics technology
have matured. At the same time, utility goals have become more realistic by
emphasizing electric accuracy instead of geography.
   Those utilities that lagged in AM/FM/GIS development were fortunate to
have avoided the dollar-tipped arrows of the pioneers. But the pioneering
days are over.
20 There are no blockbuster revelations hidden in lexicon. Old habits die
hard, particularly in the utility industry. But perhaps the definitions
presented here will stimulate discussion and a better understanding of the
distribution operations community--what it does, and what to call what it
does. If that happens, this most important aspect of a utility will be
better understood.

What's in a name: Defining critical distribution functions
   -- Distribution management system (DMS). The entire range of
applications necessary to carry out distribution operations. It consists of
power- and work-related activities, controlled by the appropriately named
control, power, and crew centers. There was a time when it was necessary
for control centers to reside in the specific service areas they handled,
and both the power and crew dispatch functions had to co-reside in the
interest of effective coordination. This is no longer the case, as is
exemplified by Southern California Edison Co's outage management system,
which capitalizes on modern communications and distributed database
technologies.
   -- Outage management. The processing and analysis of trouble incidents
on the network and support of the appropriate remedial actions, including
automatic switching plans, to enhance network availability and customer
service while minimizing restoration operation and maintenance expense.
   -- Crew dispatch. The communication and direction of work crew
activities in the field from a service control center to optimize
fleet/crew resources. (Crews may consist of only one person.) May encompass
vehicle tracking and/or routing functionality. Sometimes referred to as
field order dispatch, mobile dispatch, or mobility. Computer-aided dispatch
will inevitably be confused with computer-aided design because of the
common acronym--CAD--but the term is already set in place and cannot be
dislodged. Automatic dispatch differs from CAD in that it assumes no
dispatcher intervention in the process.
   -- Scada. Substation control and data acquisition. There is a move to
change supervisory to substation in the acronym because Scada provides
remote monitoring and real-time control of distribution substations through
the use of remote terminal units (RTUs), or occasionally, programmable
logic controllers (PLCs).
   -- Substation automation. Self-contained data acquisition and control
within one (or multiple) substation(s).
   -- Distribution automation. Remote monitoring and real-time control of
feeders, including sectionalizing devices, auto-transformers, reclosers,
capacitors, regulators and switches located in the distribution circuit.
The distribution circuit starts with the distribution feeder outside the
substation fence and extends into the ``smart building.'' Automatic meter
reading, load control, and smart building are subsets.
   -- Meter reading. The recording of power consumed by the customer to
enable billing, and, at times, measurement of load for engineering
purposes. Today there are two types of meter reading--both confusingly
referred to as AMR--augmented and automatic. Augmented uses meter readers
with hand-held computers; automatic is accomplished without meter readers
through a variety of communications technologies. AMR should be used only
to signify automatic. Hand-held methods are referred to as hand-held, not
AMR.
   -- Load control. Direct control of load at the customer's premise,
usually to shut down power-intensive appliances, machinery, and equipment.
Load control is a subset of the broader term, load management, a category
of demand-side management actions that can be accomplished with a variety
of computer and non-computer-related methods, for example, rate incentives.
Load control restricts its meaning to the computer-related subset only.
   -- Smart building. The activation of electrical devices within the
customer's premise to enable services beyond the simple distribution of
power, for example, alarming. The term ``smart home'' means strictly
residential customers, while smart building encompasses all customers.
   -- Work management. The process of 1) requesting work, 2) design, 3)
scheduling, 4) reporting, and 5) closing requests for work on the
distribution network. Initiators may be requests for construction
(customer-driven), requests for systems maintenance/improvements (customer,
field, or engineering-driven), or an unplanned incident--for example, an
outage. The first two, both planned, include all five elements of the
process. The latter--unplanned-- includes only reporting and closing.

CAN RETAILING WORK?

By:
Karl Stahlkopf

   With all the recent coverage the trade and consumer press have given the
electric power deregulation debate, one critical question remains: Is
retail wheeling feasible?
   As deregulation sweeps the US electric power industry, individual power
providers are coming to grips with the challenges of increased competition
at both the wholesale and retail levels. And electric power executives are
realizing that evaluation of these market sectors cannot be conducted in
isolation from each other. In fact, the question of whether retail wheeling
is feasible depends on changes in technologies and markets for bulk power
and vice versa.
20 The reasons are straightforward, and to some extent, resemble the
chicken and egg dilemma: Which should come first, regulatory reform of the
wholesale market to stimulate a retail electricity price drop, or reform of
the retail market to stimulate a drop in wholesale electricity prices. The
goal of retail wheeling--to provide customers with better service at lower
prices--cannot be fulfilled without comparable market reform to make
low-cost wholesale electricity more widely available through bulk-power
transactions. Conversely, retail wheeling--or some alternative approach to
retail deregulation, such as regional Power Pools--will be needed to
translate cost savings in the bulk power market into lower prices for
customers.

A complex machine
   But the feasibility question goes beyond just politics and regulation.
From a technological point of view, the two market segments are even more
intimately related, since they represent activity in different portions of
a single, huge physical network for electricity. So tightly connected is
this network--sometimes called the most complex physical machine ever
created--that power generators separated by thousands of miles must rotate
at exactly the same speed and at a carefully specified angle of separation.
Without this exquisite synchronism, power could not be transferred from one
part of the country to another in hopes of reducing overall costs.
   The question of whether retail wheeling is feasible must, therefore, be
answered in terms of what opportunities are available for improving power
delivery and market mechanisms all the way from the powerplant to the home
or workplace. In fact, an unprecedented number of such opportunities are
emerging from a technological revolution now taking place in power
delivery, as power electronics devices are being used to exert more precise
control over utility transmission and distribution systems. In addition,
recent research on the issues of cost desegregation and market management
has revealed new ways to increase the economic efficiency of the electric
power industry (see box, below).

The once, and future, grid
   One of the most important competitive challenges now facing utilities is
how to comply with the latest notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), commonly known as the
Mega-NOPR. Although the terms of the proposed rule have not yet been
finalized, it essentially mandates open access to transmission networks and
sets out minimum conditions of service that utilities must offer.
20 Open access is expected to increase both the number and complexity of
bulk power transactions on the nation's transmission grid. Already, some
40% of the electricity generated in the US is sold by the producing utility
on the wholesale power market, and some bottlenecks have begun to appear
along some transmission corridors. Construction of new transmission lines
to ease these bottlenecks, however, has become more difficult. Therefore, a
major priority for utilities is to exert better control over their bulk
power systems, using advanced technology to maximize the use of limited
transmission assets.
20 Distribution's future
Moving to the distribution side of power delivery, customers are
increasingly concerned about the vulnerability of their sensitive
electronic equipment to power disturbances. The total cost to customers of
such disturbances in increasingly significant--amounting to about $3- to
$5-billion per year in the US alone. Many customers now install their own
uninterruptible power supplies to provide ride-through capability, but
these battery-dependent devices are expensive, energy-inefficient, and
often require maintenance beyond an owner's immediate resources. Since
about 90% of outages affecting customers originate on the distribution
system, there is a pressing need to provide utilities with new ways to
offer premium quality power to customers with sensitive loads.

A question of cost
   A major concern of FERC in creating open access is how to set tariffs
for transmission services under open access. But before the industry can
set prices, it must first understand costs. One solution is the development
of a common technical basis that facilitates open discussion on costs and
tariffs. To that end, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Palo
Alto, Calif, has published a Transmission Services Costing Framework, a
tool that utilities can use to better understand their own transmission
costs.
20 Another requirement of the Mega-NOPR is that tariffs for transmission
services apply equally to the owner of a transmission system and to third
parties seeking access to the system. The level of such tariffs are still
being aggressively debated by utilities that want to recover stranded
investment costs and third-party users that want to provide low-cost power.
According to the Mega-NOPR, these tariffs and the supporting information
are to be posted electronically so that all players have access to them in
real time.

The real-time challenge
   To make retail wheeling work, the industry needs to devise retail rate
structures that more realistically match retail price to the cost of
supplying power--while still giving customers greater choice and providing
load relief during critical demand periods.
   Studies at Niagara Mohawk Power Corp, for example, found that load
curtailments could be achieved much more cost-effectively through a
real-time pricing (RTP) mechanism than they could be through an
interruptible service program. The cost to customers for a load voluntarily
foregone in response to appropriate price signals was only 10% of the cost
of an interrupted load, because customers had more flexibility in
configuring their own electricity usage.
20 The largest controlled RTP experiment to date is being conducted at
Georgia Power Co. So far, this demonstration program has shown not only an
ability to affect the load patterns of existing customers, but also an
ability to attract new customers. During the first 15 months of the
experiment, the new service option brought approximately $500-million of
new investment into Georgia--including the Sara Lee Knit Products plant.
Customers using the RTP program have seen their average electricity cost
per kilowatt-hour decrease by about 5%, while their kilowatt-hour usage
increased by more than 10%.

In a nutshell: Yes, it's feasible
   So, to answer one of the most frequently asked questions: If advanced
technologies are used to improve both the physical control of electrical
transmission and distribution systems--and the management of both wholesale
and retail markets--retail wheeling is indeed feasible. Now the remaining
question is: Feasible for whom? Answer: Most likely, the proactive power
providers that are taking advantage of the revolutionary technologies that
are transforming the industry.

EPRI's competitive push
   If technology advances are pushing the industry closer to retail
wheeling, then the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Palo Alto,
Calif, is pushing technology. Witness some of the organization's technology
responses to the competitive market:
   -- Facts (flexible ac transmission system). A pioneering concept of a
high-tech system that uses power electronics to control power flow on bulk
power networks. Specifically, this transmission system will enable
utilities to direct more power along specific corridors, enhancing overall
system stability by reacting almost instantaneously to transient
disturbances, and allowing transmission lines to be loaded closer to
thermal limits.
   Facts has a rich history. The first generation of Facts devices--such as
the thyristor-controlled series capacitor (TCSC)--could increase power flow
on specific lines, but only by switching a large capacitor bank. This year,
the second generation Facts device debuts--the static condenser (Statcon),
which can provide voltage support without the need for large external
circuit elements. The third generation, such as the unified power flow
controller (UPFC), expected to enter utility service by 1997, will be able
to control all three critical variables of power flow simultaneously:
reducing impedance, shifting power angle, and increasing voltage support.
   -- Custom power research. This program refers to the use of power
electronics controllers on utility distribution systems to prevent power
interruptions and other disturbances that affect customers directly. This
solution is often a more cost-effective, energy-efficient way to protect
sensitive loads than having a customer install an uninterruptible power
system. The inherent advantage of these controllers is their ability to
respond almost instantaneously to developing problems--compared, for
example, to the six cycles often required by mechanical reclosers.
20 Several demonstrations of custom power controllers are now under way.
One currently in use is the solid-state transfer switch, which provides
uninterrupted power to a customer by switching a load from a faulted feeder
to an independent, unfaulted feeder within a quarter cycle. Another
controller being demonstrated is the dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), a
solid-state controller that protects a critical load from power-line
disturbances--reacting to momentary voltage sags and swells by exchanging
reactive power with a distribution line.
20 A third controller system being demonstrated involves the distribution
static condenser (D-Statcon), which protects the distribution system from
the effects of a ``polluting'' electrical load by continuously adjusting
the level of line compensation for varying load conditions.
   -- Transmission services costing framework. The framework was actually
developed before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) announced
its proposed rule making on transmission access, and was intended to be a
broadly applicable tool that utilities could use to better understand their
own transmission costs. Applying the framework involves a straightforward,
three-step process: definition of transmission services in terms of their
attributes; identification of service components and associated costs; and
actual calculation of costs. By following these steps in detail, a utility
can not only develop a rational basis for submitting tariff proposals to
FERC, but also determine how best to control transmission costs on a
particular system.
   -- Transmission services information network (TSIN). On Oct 13, 1995,
EPRI submitted a report to FERC recommending how a nationwide TSIN can be
implemented to facilitate such an information exchange. This report was
prepared in close coordination with the North American Electric Reliability
Council, Princeton, NJ, which helped determine what data should be made
available on TSIN. The first phase of the implementation of TSIN is
expected by June 1996 and will involve use of the public Internet. A second
phase, involving access through private networks, will provide a higher
level of functionality.

NOPR PRICING DEFINED

By:
The editors

   A new study--authored by Richard H. Hilt, a partner in Bright Line
Energy Inc, Palo Alto, Calif, and published by UDI/McGraw-Hill, Washington,
DC--can help utility executives see the future more clearly. Titled,
``Winning in the Competitive Wholesale Power Markets: How the Top Electric
Utilities Fare Under New FERC Rules,'' the study analyzes the possible
impact of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) final rules at the
national and regional levels, as well as on individual investor-owned
utilities.
20 Analysis is based on data from the utilities' 1994 Form 1 filings to
FERC, which fix the size of today's utility wholesale market at $16-billion
annually--or 25% of the investor-owned utility total. Other estimates place
the future size of the wholesale market--after retail wheeling becomes a
reality--at about $200-billion a year.
20 The study also analyzes the effect of the final rules on open-access
tariff calculations for the nation as a whole, and for specific utilities.
For any utility, the tariff can be calculated if one knows the value of its
existing transmission system, the peak demand on that system, and the
generic cost of capital. For 1994, the study calculates that the national
average tariff for transmission service between designated points was about
$21/MW/yr.
   ``Winning in the Competitive Wholesale Power Markets: How the Top
Electric Utilities Fare Under New FERC Rules'' is available from
UDI/McGraw-Hill for $395, or with utility data base for $695. For more

CONGRESS TO DOE: TAKE THE WASTE
Profiles of current matters of regulatory interest and note as reported in
McGraw-Hill Energy Group's Electric Power Daily, Electric Utility Week,
Inside NRC, and Inside FERC newsletters

   Lost in the current budget debate is legislation (HR 1020) which
reaffirms the federal government's obligation to receive and store spent
fuel from nuclear powerplants. Specifically, the bill would require the
Dept of Energy (DOE) to take the following steps:
   -- Construct and operate a central interim storage facility for spent
nuclear fuel by 1998. The two-phase facility would operate for 20 years
beginning in 1998 with a capacity of 10,000 metric tons of uranium. Phase
II would increase the facility's capacity to 40,000 metric tons under a
100-yr license.
   -- Construct and operate a permanent repository. DOE must apply to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) by 2001 for authorization to build a
repository which must begin operating by 2010. If site characterization
proves the Yucca Mountain site cannot meet NRC criteria, the program will
be terminated.
   -- Develop a transportation system to move the spent fuel from nuclear
powerplants to the interim and permanent storage facilities beginning in
1998. Included in this are fuel acceptance schedules and transportation
routes and emergency planning assistance to affected states, localities,
and Indian tribes.
   -- Begin moving spent nuclear fuel by Jan 31, 1998, as required by the
Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.
   The House Rules Committee began reviewing the legislation after
Thanksgiving. It has already been approved by the House Commerce
Committee.
   HR 1020 would replace the current nuclear-waste funding system with a
user fee to ensure that consumers pay only what DOE spends on the civilian
waste-management system. In a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
members sponsoring the bill explain that the new user fee takes responsible
steps to ensure that the ratepayers are protected from federal
misappropriation of their contributions.
   To enable DOE to meet its 1998 obligation, the legislation outlines
responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act for each major
activity to develop the integrated system. For example, instead of DOE and
NRC preparing separate environmental impact statements (EIS) for the
interim facility, only the NRC would file an EIS but with DOE input. DOE
would be responsible for preparing an EIS on the construction and
transportation facilities from existing rail lines to an interim storage
facility and in conjunction with a license application for a repository.
   A hearing on a similar bill developed in the Senate (S 1271), which also
calls for DOE to build and operate an interim storage facility for spent
nuclear fuel, has yet to be scheduled for review by the Senate Energy
Committee.

PARK SERVICE HUNTS FOR POWER SAVINGS
Profiles of current matters of regulatory interest and note as reported in
McGraw-Hill Energy Group's Electric Power Daily, Electric Utility Week,
Inside NRC, and Inside FERC newsletters

   The National Park Service is looking to electric utilities for ideas on
managing its energy use. While most people think of the Park Service as
land managers, it operates 368 facilities in 49 states, plus territories
and commonwealths. The facilities provide services for 300-million visitors
annually and range from visitors' centers at remote national parks and
battlefields to urban memorials like the St. Louis (Mo) arch, to historic
sites , such as Ford's Theatre in Washington, DC.
   Some facilities, such as the Independence Center in Philadelphia, Pa,
consume more power than others. According to Mike Eisenberg, an engineer in
the agency's Denver (Colo) Service Center, the Park Service plans to spend
$100-million over the next 10 years renovating and installing efficient
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. One project
already under way is the new HVAC system at the White House.
   Eisenberg says the Park Service is a perfect match for electric
utilities wishing to ``try out new ideas,'' because it offers a diversity
of facilities and a desire to explore new technologies.

GAS INDUSTRY SEES OPPORTUNITY IN ELECTRIC'S REVAMP
Profiles of current matters of regulatory interest and note as reported in
McGraw-Hill Energy Group's Electric Power Daily, Electric Utility Week,
Inside NRC, and Inside FERC newsletters

   The natural gas industry faces many structural, financial, and
regulatory issues because of the impending electric power industry
restructuring, but will also benefit from new opportunities for growth,
according to a study released recently by the American Gas Assn (AGA). The
report, ``Electric Industry Restructuring and its Implications for the
Natural Gas Industry,'' points to power generation, new technologies in the
commercial and industrial sectors, natural-gas vehicles, and gas cooling as
markets with growth potential.
   The electric power industry is unlikely to adversely affect natural-gas
markets in the near future, because, explains AGA President Michael Baly,
``of the renewed strength of gas in those markets, the large existing
investment in natural-gas equipment and appliances, and the limits on
electricity price decreases imposed by transition costs.''
The report suggests that gas demand for power generation will grow
substantially between now and 2010, but for the next several years will
remain fairly flat at about 3-trillion ft3/yr.
   As federal and state regulatory commissions proceed with restructuring,
it will in the long term cause fundamental changes for some gas companies.
   But the opportunities created by a more competitive marketplace can
provide the gas industry with a growing and healthy future, Baly says.
   Partnerships and strategic alliances between energy companies of all
types provide natural gas utilities with another avenue to satisfy customer
needs. Combination electric and gas utilities have provided retail service
and will no doubt continue to do so, just as some companies will specialize
in either gas or electric service. But, Baly concludes, ``there is no
question that companies that market both natural gas and electricity as
commodities to energy customers nationwide could play an important role in

CARE TO COMMENT ON HYDRO RELICENSING?
Profiles of current matters of regulatory interest and note as reported in
McGraw-Hill Energy Group's Electric Power Daily, Electric Utility Week,
Inside NRC, and Inside FERC newsletters

Elizabeth A. Bretz

   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a notice of
filing in response to a National Hydropower Assn (NHA) petition proposing
hydropower relicensing reform. This officially opens the comment period on
the proposed reforms.
   NHA's proposal addresses specific areas in the current process that it
sees as impeding the overall effectiveness of project relicensing. For
example, in 1991, over 160 license applications were submitted to FERC for
approval. However, as a result of the regulatory quagmire within the
existing relicensing process, the majority of those licenses have yet to be
renewed. As a result, licensees, state and federal resource agencies, and
conservation groups have found common ground--equal frustration with the
system.
