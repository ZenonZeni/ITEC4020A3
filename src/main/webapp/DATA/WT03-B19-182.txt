<H1>Proximity to Markets</H1>
<P>
With its proximity to national and international markets, Melbourne
is well located for export - as well as domestically -oriented
manufacturing operations. Melbourne -based manufacturers are well
served by speedy transport services by road, rail, sea and air,
with fast transport access between factories, ports and airports.
