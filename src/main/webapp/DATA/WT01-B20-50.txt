<p align="center"><font size="3"><strong><b>JIMMY MONTGOMERY
STILL IN PRISON: CONDITION DETERIORATING,<br>
AS GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DOES &quot;SPIN CONTROL&quot;</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 18,</b> Oklahoma City, OK.&nbsp;
Paraplegic Jimmy Montgomery remains in prison, and he is still not
receiving adequate medical care to properly treat his anti-biotic
resistant infections.&nbsp; As a result, his life remains in
danger.&nbsp; However, he is now receiving showers, a change of
clothes, clean bandages (from his mother), and is now able to
wash his clothes separately from the other prisoners.<br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The office of Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating is telling callers
that they are doing everything possible to get Montgomery
released to house arrest and they are actually urging people to
call and complain to the prosecutor, Richard Dugger, who blocked
his release.&nbsp; Callers have also received various versions of
spin control, depending on whom they talked to.&nbsp; One caller
was told that Montgomery had been selling marijuana to
children.&nbsp; Another was informed that since he was convicted
by a jury, he must have done something much more serious than
what &quot;the propaganda [NORML] is saying,&quot; but that the
state wanted him out of prison because he was costing them too much
money.&nbsp; A third caller was told that the Governor's staff
couldn't understand why this case was getting so much attention,
because they had not read anything about the case in the local media. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Montgomery will eventually be released, <b><i><u>if he doesn't
die first, and if you keep calling the governor's office.</u></i></b>&nbsp;
Your calls have clearly made the difference in the way he is
being treated.&nbsp; The State of Oklahoma may eventually free
him to house arrest, but they will not free the people of Oklahoma
from the chains of a lifetime of hate propaganda.&nbsp; NORML
would be interested in hearing any novel efforts at spin control
callers may have encountered from the governor's office.</p>

PROHIBITIONIST SUMMIT A PROPAGANDA FAILURE!&nbsp; ENTERTAINMENT
INDUSTRY LAUNCHES NEW &quot;ANTI-LEGALIZATION&quot; EFFORT</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 15,</b> Atlanta, GA.&nbsp; Prohibitionists
at a sparsely attended mayors conference were disappointed to
find organized opposition and minimal media coverage, which they
had to share with anti-prohibitionists.&nbsp; Bob Keizer, the
Dutch Minister who heads the Department of Alcohol, Drug and
Tobacco Policy of the Dutch Ministry of Health joined a group of
prominent American anti-prohibitionists--including the former
mayor of Hartford--to object to the misrepresentation of European
drug policies at a Press Conference on Monday, May 15th.&nbsp;
The day before the summit, reform activists demonstrated against
the conference from 1 to 4 PM. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference, billed as &quot;American Cities Against
Drugs,&quot; was held at tax-payers expense and had promised that
attendees would &quot;Hear from key European mayors about the
devastation Legalization is bringing to their cities.&quot;&nbsp;
Instead, attendees heard the former mayor of Stockholm warn
against flying KLM out of Amsterdam because the pilots may be
stoned on marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The conference was more notable for announcing the formation of a
new prohibitionist propaganda effort by Hollywood known as the
National Drug Prevention League.&nbsp; This was founded by the
Entertainment Industries Council (EIC), which is sponsored by
such great moral leaders as Frank Sinatra, Aaron Spelling, and
Fred Silverman. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Now the wonderful folks who brought us <i>Reefer Madness, Mary
Jane</i>, and other film classics are pushing a new music video,
&quot;Will you be there tomorrow?&quot;&nbsp; The video purports
to present &quot;the legalization issue [as seen] through the
eyes of children.&quot;&nbsp; Perhaps they will also make other
videos giving us their view -- &quot;as seen through the eyes of
children&quot; -- of other complex issues such as health care
reform, nuclear waste disposal, and flat rate versus progressive
taxation.&nbsp; &quot;Will you be taxed tomorrow?&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">EIC says that it will be sponsoring an industry briefing session
on drugs and violence for Orlando-based entertainment executives
in July and is now organizing the industry's &quot;Drugs, Violence
and Youth, Truth or Tragedy Conference&quot; in October.&nbsp; Is
hypocrisy too complex a subject for a music video?</p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><strong><b>NORML TO PRESENT
LETTER TO DUTCH AMBASSADOR;<br>
JOINS INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR DUTCH DRUG POLICY</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 19,</b> Washington, D.C. NORML has joined
an international coalition of anti-prohibitionists in voicing its
support for Dutch drug policies-as they apply to marijuana.&nbsp;
In a letter to the Dutch Ambassador, NORML saluted the Dutch for
their cannabis policies.&nbsp; By making cannabis available in
almost 2,000 coffee shops around Holland, the Dutch have broken
the connection between hard drugs and cannabis.&nbsp; Instead of
studying the success of Dutch drug policies, American prohibitionists
are waging a propaganda campaign against our oldest and most
reliable ally, falsely claiming that peaceful Holland has become
a violent country as a result of its drug policies.</p>

drug policy, please contact Allen St. Pierre, NORML, (202)

<p align="center"><font size="3"><strong><b>SLAIN MARIJUANA
USER'S FAMILY FILES WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 10,</b> Beaver Dam, WI.&nbsp; According to
the <i>Green Bay Press-Gazette</i>, in response to the April 17
shooting of their son, Scott Bryant, 29, by Dodge County sheriffs
detective Robert Neuman, parents Boyd and Shirley Bryant have
filed a wrongful death claim.&nbsp; Law enforcement's yield from
the Bryant killing; A very small amount of marijuana [According
to NORML activists in WI, less than 1 gram of marijuana was
discovered!) along with two .22-caliber rifles and five pellet guns.&nbsp;
Bryant was unarmed when he was killed. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Beaver Dam lawyer Scott Rasmussen will be representing the
Bryants in their lawsuit on behalf of their dead son, his 8
year-old boy (who was home at the time of the shooting), and his
family.&nbsp; Rasmussen told the <i>Press Gazette</i>, &quot;We
will be claiming that the shooting was both negligent and an
intentional act.&nbsp; Both of those are questions for a jury to
determine.&quot;</p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><strong><b>CALIFORNIA IS
'BUZZING' WITH MEDICINAL MARIJUANA NEWS</b></strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 17,</b> Sacramento, CA.&nbsp; Despite the
likelihood of passing legislation (AB 1529) that will enable sick
and dying medical patients to have legal access to marijuana,
Governor Wilson is making noises that he will veto the bill. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Anticipating the Governor's appalling position on this issue,
California NORML and Californians for Compassionate Use (CCU) are
sponsoring a medical marijuana initiative for the 1996
ballot.&nbsp; On May 15, CA NORML and CCU received a significant
endorsement for their initiative strategy when <i>The San Jose
Mercury-News</i> editorialized, &quot;A ballot measure may be the only
hope for a rational marijuana policy.&quot;&nbsp; [emphasis added
