<b>Instructional Classroom Management<br>
A Proactive Approach to Behavior Management<br></b>
Edward J. Kameenui and Craig B. Darch<p>
The primary difference between an instructional approach to classroom management and all other approaches is that before an action or problem occurs, the teacher, carefully and strategically, teaches all that is required so that students will have the information necessary to behave appropriately. The authors offer a 180-day plan or curriculum for teaching appropriate behavior. Teachers will learn how to use effective teaching procedures in social and behavior skills instruction.<p>
