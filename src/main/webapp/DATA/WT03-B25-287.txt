TITLE &amp; AUTHOR <BR>
<BR>
Closing the loop: An exploration of continental landcover change and its
direct feedback on the Climate System, 1990-2060 [R.D. Graetz] <BR>
<BR>
OBJECTIVES <BR>
<BR>
To explore potential landcover changes over the entire Australian continent,
for the next 70 years (1990 - 2060), and the direct feedback of these changes
on the Climate System . <BR>
<BR>
QUESTIONS ADDRESSED <BR>
<BR>
What are the existing continental patterns of landcover structure, phenology
and composition; and what soil, climatic and landuse factors are the determinants
of these patterns? <BR>
<BR>
What are the minimum set of plausible scenarios (1990 - 2060) for these
climatic and landuse factors? <BR>
<BR>
What will be the resultant spatial and temporal patterns of landcover change
under each scenario, and thus the strength and sign of the direct (changed
surface conditions) feedback on the Climate System? <BR>
<BR>
METHODOLOGY <BR>
<BR>
Explore the spatial patterns of landcover change probability using landuse
change scenarios that capture the interaction of the evolution of both climatic
and social systems; <BR>
<BR>
Compute the direct feedback on the Climate System of the resultant landcover
changes from the various scenarios; <BR>
<BR>
Design and demonstrate a methodology to assimilate and test the generated
landcover change hypotheses (probability patterns) in an iterative 3-D data
assimilation mode, thereby largely overcoming the problem of model validation.

ISN: A methodology for atmospherically correcting earth observations in
the visible and near-infrared wavebands employing a network of spectrally
invariant ground targets. [R.D. Graetz] <BR>
<BR>
OBJECTIVES <BR>
<BR>
To develop and apply a methodology for converting TOA broad waveband reflectances
in the visible and near-infrared to surface values, retrospectively and
prospectively, using a network of spectrally invariant ground targets. <BR>
<BR>
QUESTIONS ADDRESSED <BR>
<BR>
What is the size and sign of the atmospheric contribution to clear-sky,
broad waveband visible and near-infrared reflectances derived from the MSS,
AVHRR and other instruments, calculated TOA? <BR>
<BR>
What are the spatial and temporal patterns in the size and sign of the atmospheric
contribution, and in what way can these be related to the synoptic air mass
characteristics, or otherwise geographically zoned over the continent? <BR>
<BR>
What are the characteristics of a network of ground targets that would be
critical prerequisites for their use to provide an empirical atmospheric
correction to AVHRR data in an operational context, retrospectively and
prospectively. <BR>
<BR>
METHODOLOGY <BR>
<BR>
Using the AVHRR archive (1981 - ), to locate ground targets that exhibit
invariant or systematically varying spectral characteristics within the
three classes of low (eg. water bodies), mid (eg. bare rock outcrops), and
high reflectance (eg. salinas) in the visible and near-infrared wavebands.
<BR>
<BR>
To quantify, interpret and model the absolute and relative spectral variability
of a subset of these ground targets as a function of time, illumination
and viewing geometry using field and laboratory measurements. <BR>
<BR>
To generate and publish a continuous time series (1981 - present) of visible
and near infrared reflectances of a critical subset of these ground targets
(10-20) as a validation lookup table. <BR>
<BR>
To devise and apply an operational methodology, using the validation lookup
tables and based on the 'empirical line technique', to atmospherically correct
the afternoon-pass AVHRR dataset, retrospectively and prospectively. <BR>
<BR>
To compare and possibly integrate the developed ISN technique with that
of SMAC (Rahman &amp; Dedieu, 1994) <BR>
<BR>

TITLE &amp; AUTHOR <BR>
<BR>
The development and validation of a spatial-spectral measurement model to
detect and quantify change in tree/shrub density over a herbaceous understorey.
[R.D. Graetz] <BR>
<BR>
OBJECTIVES <BR>
<BR>
To develop and test simple spatial-spectral models to quantify the canopy
cover / density in sparsely wooded grasslands using high spatial resolution
SPOT data. <BR>
<BR>
QUESTIONS ADDRESSED <BR>
<BR>
Is it possible to quantify thinning (not clearing) and regrowth of native
trees/shrubs within recently cleared and established pastures; eg. in Central
Queensland? <BR>
<BR>
Is it possible to quantify the invasion of native grasslands by the exotic
shrubs and trees; eg. Acacia nilotica in the Mitchell grasslands of Western
Queensland. <BR>
<BR>
METHODOLOGY <BR>
<BR>
On the basis of on the length of archive and certainty of change, paired
scenes (5 years apart) will be chosen for which MSS and Panchromatic data
available and which capture the maximum spectral contrast between woody
overstorey and grassy understorey. <BR>
<BR>
A spatial analysis of spectral variance ('smart filtering') will be applied
to the youngest scene to infer tree density. After geometric and radiometric
normalisation, the same analysis will be applied to the oldest scene, and
to the youngest-oldest scene difference image to infer change in tree density.
<BR>
<BR>
Subject to confirmation by field measurement, a third scene (1996) will
be requested that, in conjunction with contemporary field measurements,
will validate the technique. <BR>
<BR>
OUTPUTS <BR>
<BR>
The pilot project would be reported in the format of an electronic document
on CD-ROM published by CSIRO. The CD-ROM would be written in standard format
and include browsing and viewing of software compatible across UNIX, DOS,
and Macintosh platforms. <BR>
<BR>
DATA REQUIREMENTS &amp; PRODUCTS <BR>
<BR>
Requirements: <BR>
<BR>
- Panchromatic and MSS digital data sets for one full SPOT scene on three
separate dates. <BR>
<BR>
Products: <BR>
<BR>
