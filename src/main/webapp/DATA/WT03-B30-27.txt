McDONNELL DOUGLAS/KOREA INITIATE KFP NEGOTIATIONS

     McDonnell Douglas and Korean defense and industry officials
have begun negotiations, through the Pentagon's Defense Security
Assistance Agency (DSAA), to work out the details of the
increasingly controversial Korean Fighter Program (KFP), a
McDonnell Douglas official tells DEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL.
     A spokesman for Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), one of the most
outspoken opponents of this deal and the recent FSX agreement
with Japan, added that the deal will probably be finalized within
three to four months, after which Dixon will seek a General
Accounting Office review of the program before Congress considers
any alterations to the arrangement.
     The talks--which will focus mainly on offsets, a
congressional source told DEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL last
week--come three weeks after Korea chose to purchase 120
McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 fighters to serve as its air force's
frontline aircraft to counter North Korea's newest aircraft, the
Soviet MiG-29 Fulcrum.  General Dynamics' cheaper F-16 was the
alternative, but was rejected in favor of the F/A-18's more
advanced avionics and "superior...two-engine safety and maritime
capability."
     A Korean aerospace industry source said recently that the
decision may have also hinged on the fact that beyond-visual-
range missiles are not standard items on the F-16's combat suite.
The Korean air force currently has 36 F-16s in its inventory.

Deal To Hinge On Quality, Not Percentage Of Offsets

     Congress, meanwhile, has already stated it will not allow
the deal to go through unless Korea and McDonnell Douglas can
prove that America's industrial base is not harmed and that U.S.
offsets negotiated are no more than 30 percent of the deal's
total cost.  Opponents are also worried over the possible
transfer of sensitive technology to Korea, which will also
receive guidance from McDonnell Douglas on creating an indigenous
aerospace industry.
     American industry officials in Korea, however, say that the
country will not receive any technology that it does not have.
Additionally, they add that while Korea will learn to build
advanced aircraft, the nation's aerospace industry is barely in
its infancy and is years away from being able to design and build
a simple aircraft, and decades away from be able to design, build
and produce an indigenous fighter.
     Even so, congressional sources told us that 30 percent
offsets may not be allowed depending on what specifically they
will involve.  The Dixon spokesman said, "We have to see what
exactly is entailed in that 30 percent requirement."  The staffer
added "we have to see the notification from the White House that
the deal was signed and the details of the agreement."
     He noted that in 1988, Congress passed a resolution that
allows U.S. subcontractors on international projects to address
the administration if company officials see the agreement or its
offsets as harmful. "If we're giving up technical data that one
of the U.S. subcontractors either owns or has rights to, or which
would adversely affect that company, they can bring this to
Commerce or DoD...," the aid said.

Special Supplement On European Integration Included
With This Issue For Regular Subscribers

     An industry source recently confirmed for DEFENSE MARKETING
INTERNATIONAL that the deal may not come down to the percentage
of offsets, but the "quality of those offsets."  The official
said that high offsets involving the purchase of low or medium
technology items, or non-technology items, such as agriculture
equipment, would be seen as more favorable by Congress than a
deal requiring the purchase or sale of advanced and high-tech
aerospace systems.
     A Korean government official said the aircraft will cost
about $35 million a copy, putting the total cost of the program
somewhere between $3.4 and $4 billion, not including additional
support equipment and spares.  The first is slated for delivery
to Korea in 1993.

GERMAN/U.K. DEFENSE MINISTERS TO MEET ON EFA RADAR

     British Defense Minister Tom King and West German Defense
Minister Dr. Gerhard Stoltenberg have scheduled a meeting during
the next three weeks in which they will discuss ongoing political
problems with the radar system for the European Fighter Aircraft
(EFA), the director for EFA marketing at British Aerospace
headquarters said in an interview with DEFENSE MARKETING
INTERNATIONAL.
     Ned Frith added that the problem has been dramatically
overstated by industry and the press, and that the program will
come down to either utilizing a common radar, or having each
program nation independently install a system it prefers.  "It
would be nice if there were a common radar," he said.  "But it
may very well be that there will not be a common system."
     The competing systems are GEC Avionics (U.K.) teamed with
AEG (Germany) on the MSD-200--favored by Germany, and Ferranti's
ECR-90--favored by Britain, Spain and Italy.  [EFA fly-away cost
is currently put between $17 and $20 million per copy.]
     As far as program milestones go, he said that the radar
situation has not affected the development schedule of the
fighter.  "You don't need a radar to develop carbon composite
wings or body panels, or engines, or landing gear."  Eight EFA
prototypes are slated to be constructed by the mid-1990s, of
which three fuselages are nearly complete (see below).
     The defense ministers are also expected to address problems
related to workshare.  Work distribution for the fighter is 33
percent each for Germany (MBB) and Britain (BAe), 21 percent for
Italy (Aeritalia), and 13 percent for Spain (Casa).  Frith said
that although the development phase of the program is fully
funded by all governments, the levels are unequal.  However,
according to the original MOU (signed in 1988), all countries
involved are to aid in development in all of the aircraft's
systems--the cost of which may prevent the smaller nations from
being fully involved.  "But that is pretty close to being
solved," Frith said.

Fuselages To Be Tested This Spring

     The forward fuselages for the first two European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA) prototypes are under construction at British
Aerospace's Warton Airfield, England, in preparation for ground
and flight tests to be conducted later this spring, Frith said.
     The first body section, designated P.01, will be completed
this spring and fitted with electronic and hydraulic systems
before being shipped to Messerschmidt Boelkow Blohm (MBB) in West
Germany for final aircraft assembly.  The second fuselage,
designated P.02 and being developed strictly for ground testing,
is now being fitted with a cockpit for pilot simulations and
testing of cockpit controls and systems.  It is also being fitted
with the Crew Escape Unit (CEU), which will also undergo ground
systems tests.  BAe said that 12 more fuselages are planned in
the next few years to support EFA's ground and flight test
programs.

THOMSON-CSF TAKES FORMAL CONTROL OF PHILIPS DIVISIONS

     Thomson-CSF (France)--having signed a formal agreement to
transfer controlling interest in Philips' (the Netherlands)
defense electronics businesses over to the French giant--plans to
incorporate the new division, and two other recently purchased
European interests, into a new holding company called Thomson-TRT
Defense.
     Company officials said last week the sale, agreed to in
principle last August, entails to transfer of 80 percent interest
in the Philips subsidiary Hollandse Signaalapparaten B.V. to
Thomson.  That company currently develops and produces aircraft
radar fire control systems, military telecommunications
equipment, and command and control systems for the Netherlands
navy, air force and army.  The world's leading command and
control systems exporter, Signaalapparaten's 1988 sales (most
recent data) totaled over $469.974 million. Company officials
reiterated that "the increasing costs of developing and producing
defense equipment and the pressure on defense budgets,
particularly in Europe, make cooperation necessary
for...governments and companies.

Plans To Create New French Electronics Firm

     Also under the deal, Thomson acquired 49 percent of Philips'
Belgium subsidiary, MBLE, which has activities in military
telecommunications, airborne radar systems, and munition
electronics.  MBLE's sales in 1988 totaled over $26.110 million.
Having already acquired 99 percent of the defense operations of
France's TRT corp., Thomson plans to bring the three separate
businesses together as Thomson-TRT Defense--a deal that was
finalized on Jan. 8, company representatives said.
     TRT, a company with annual sales of more than $208.877
million in 1988, develops and manufactures opto-electronic
systems, munition electronics, and radio navigation and
communication equipment.
     All three divisions had total sales in 1988 of over $700
million.

     *GEC AVIONICS PLANS 700 DEFENSE JOB CUT.  Faced with a
decline in defense export orders, Britain's GEC Avionics, which
supplies equipment to the U.S. Air Force, plans a cut of 700
employees over the next two years.  GEC says the reduction
reflects a decline in the current export program and is not a
reflection of concern for the future of the defense business.  It
added, however, that it will reassess the situation in 1992 for a
possible reversal of the current downtrend.  GEC Avionics is part
of the GEC Marconi defense group and is heavily engaged in the
defense export market.

     *BAE CONTINUES WORKER SUSPENSIONS.    British Aerospace has
suspended without pay another 70 workers who refused to cross the
picket lines in the strike for shorter working hours, in addition
to the 286 workers suspended earlier this week for the same
reason.  The union is striking BAe plants at Preston, Chester and
Kingston upon Thames even after the company has offered to reduce
the work week to 37 hours if the workers will return to work
before the start of negotiations.

FRENCH MOD SEEKS NEARLY 4 PERCENT INCREASE IN 1990 BUDGET

     France's Ministry of Defense is seeking a 3.88 percent
increase for its 1990 defense budget, up from $31.30 billion in
1989, to $32.487 billion in 1990.  However, the budget is still a
bill and is under parliamentary review.
     Under the new figures, procurement funding for the country's
services is as follows: Army, $4.031 billion (23 percent); Navy,
$4.117 billion (23.5 percent); Air Force, $4.305 billion (24.5
percent); and $5.060 billion for the Gendarmerie and common
forces (29 percent).
     General funding for total French defense expenditures breaks
down as follows: Research and Development, $5.266 billion (30.13
percent); equipment and ammunition, $8.370 billion (47.75
percent); Infrastructure, $1.561 billion (8.89 percent);
personnel, $360.206 million (2.04 percent); maintenance, $1.955
billion (11.20 percent).
     The main programs each service is working on includes:
Continued procurement of 46 advanced AMX Leclerc tanks, 284
armored vehicles, and 17 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS);
Continued refits to the navy's fleet of nuclear ballistic missile
submarines, a refit of the Crusader to fill the sea air defense
role until the Rafale comes on line in the mid-1990s and
continued work on the Rafale; and continued procurement of Mirage
2000s and development of the Rafale advanced fighter for the air
force.

U.K. SEEKS NEARLY 5 PERCENT INCREASE IN DEFENSE FOR 1990

     Britain is seeking a 4.8 percent increase in its defense
budget for 1990, up from $32.666 current billions in 1989, to
$34.243 billion this fiscal year.  A top Ministry of Defense
official tells DEFENSE MARKETING INTERNATIONAL that the 1990
figure is only an MoD projection and that the exact figure (which
is classified) will not be released until the bill reaches
Parliament this spring.
     Broken down by force structure, funding for general programs
is as follows: strategic nuclear force, $1.794 billion; general
navy combat forces, $3.746 billion; European theatre ground
forces, $5.351 billion; army combat forces, $283.266 million; air
force general forces, $5.477 billion.  Research and Development
for current programs, $3.683 billion; training, $2.109 billion;
general equipment support, $1.637 billion; other support, $6.704
billion.
     The MoD has also projected (in current billions) an
approximate 5 percent increase for the 1990-91 budget, or $36.023
billion, and just over a four percent increase for the 1991-92
budget, or $37.57 billion.
     For 1990, continuing navy procurements include another
Trafalgar class nuclear submarine.  That order was initiated in
May 1979.  Since then, the MoD has placed "three in service; the
latest, HMS Trenchant, entered service in February (1989).  The
fourth, HMS Talent, is planned to enter service this year."  Four
conventionally-powered submarines also came into service
throughout 1989.  Additionally, the Navy is currently holding
competitions for another batch of Type 23 frigates for service
into the next century and adds that further orders for the newest
Harrier, the Sea Harrier, will be placed with British Aerospace,
the prime contractor.
     The army brought a sixth Challenger battle tank regiment
into service in 1989, and plans to bring a seventh this year.
Additionally, the Army says, "The Chieftain tank must be replaced
as soon as practicable, and Vickers defense systems have been
given the opportunity to show that they can deliver Challenger 2
Mk 2 to specifications, time and cost."  The Army is currently
funding the demonstration phase, which ends this September.
Future plans include development of the high-velocity Rapier 2000
tactical surface-to-air missile, which will form the bases of a
third air defense regiment.  New systems slated to come on line
in the early 1990s include: the Multiple Launch Rocket System
(MLRS); the Phoenix remotely piloted vehicle, and the Challenger
armored repair and recovery vehicle.
     The air force brought its first squadron of Harrier GR5s
into service last year, and have an order in place for delivery
of 26 Tornado GR1s to offset peacetime cuts.  The service also
brought its first Tristar air tanker into service.  Development
of the European Fighter Aircraft--the first three fuselages of
which are now under final construction for testing later this
spring--is under way.  A top BAe source in the U.K. told DEFENSE
MARKETING INTERNATIONAL last week that British defense minister
Tom King and West German defense minister Dr. Gerhard Stoltenberg
have planned a meeting within the next two or three weeks to
discuss which radar system to use.
     Regarding government-funded general research, the MoD
states, "we plan to spend $727 million on defense research...It
is our aim gradually to reduce spending on government-funded
defense research...and will pursue collaborative opportunities
vigorously."
