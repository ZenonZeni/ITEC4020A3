<h3>Clinton Administration Continues to Push For Flawed Crypto Export Policy</h3>
<p>
The Clinton Administration has continued to push its latest key escrow cryptography export proposal, despite a chorus of disapproval from civil liberties advocates and the computer and communications industry. At a public meeting at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) on December 5, 1995, Administration officials presented a <A HREF="http://csrc.ncsl.nist.gov/keyescrow/criteria.txt">revised version of their proposed Key Escrow Export Criteria</A> (initially proposed in September 1995). The proposal keeps in place the current export ban on strong cryptography, and allows for the export of moderately stronger (64-bit key length) systems meeting strict key escrow criteria.
<p>
The proposal was roundly criticized by civil liberties organization, companies, and individuals at the December 5, 1995 meeting on the grounds that it would create a barrier to security and privacy on the Net. It is expected that the Administration will soon move forward to formally adopt the proposal as part of its current export criteria for cryptography.
