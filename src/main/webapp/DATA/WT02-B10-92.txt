LSR Technologies, Inc. of Acton, Massachusetts is a developer of new technology for physical and chemical separations. Through the SBIR program, LSR developed the Core Separator, and advanced dust collector and the most efficient of its kind. The device can be used to control particulate air emissions from industrial sources especially those which employ coal or other low-grade fuels. It can also be used for the recovery of valuable product material.<P>

The Core Separator is the most efficient centrifugal collector on the market today. Dust emissions from this device are typically 3-6 times lower than from conventional mechanical collectors. Its performance, in fact, approaches that of fabric filters and electrostatic precipitators (ESP), but at much lower cost and maintenance. The Core Separator is a highly differentiated product. It is protected by existing and pending patents. Because of its low cost and unique features, many units have been sold in just its first year of introduction.<P>

In its first year of commercial offering, eighteen (18) Core Separator installations were completed in a broad range of industrial applications. Several were used for emission control purposes and have met all regulatory requirements. Others were installed to recover feed stock material and in some cases produced paybacks of less than six months.<P>
