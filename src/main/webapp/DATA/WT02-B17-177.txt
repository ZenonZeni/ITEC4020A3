<H3>DOE TO CONTINUE ASSISTING COMMUNITIES
ON SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
</H3><P>

	Following a 7-month test run, the U.S. Department of Energy will continue an initiative that helps communities marry their economic development goals with environmental health and good energy practices, Assistant Secretary Christine Ervin announced today.<P>
	"We are finding that communities are intensely interested in achieving economic progress without sacrificing environmental quality," said Ervin, who heads DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.

	Ervin launched a pilot project March 1 to help communities explore "sustainable development" -- a development strategy that strives to end conflicts between economic and environmental progress.  Called the Center of Excellence for Sustainable Development, the project offers a "tool kit" of manuals, workbooks and data bases on the World Wide Web, and a small team of specialists who provide technical assistance from DOE's Denver Regional Support Office.<P>
	Ervin reported monthly visits to the Web site have grown from about 3,000 in March to 76,000 in August.  The Center of Excellence also has received more than 800 inquiries from communities by phone and e-mail since March 1.<P>
	The technical assistance team has distributed information to hundreds of community officials and has participated in sustainable development consultations in Atlanta, Albuquerque, Baltimore, San Diego, Seattle, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Iowa, Arkansas and Florida.<P>
	"Communities clearly are interested in sustainable technologies," Ervin said.  "We will continue serving this need with the Center of Excellence for as long as the demand continues."<P>


	According to Ervin, upcoming projects by the Center include:<BR>
<UL>
<li>A national teleconference organized by Renew America in the spring to reach 150 communities with information about energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies<P>
<li>One-day workshops in cities that have won federal Empowerment Zone grants to revitalize economically depressed neighborhoods
<li>A cooperative agreement with the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Association of Counties to help communities practice sustainable development and learn about DOE's energy efficiency and renewable energy programs<P>
<li>Continued expansion of the information and technical assistance tools available to communities on the Center's Web site
</ul><P>
	Communities can reach the Center at <a href="www.sustainable.doe.gov">www.sustainable.doe.gov</a> or 1-800-357-7732.<P>
