<P>
Choose any of the following topics and we'll
give you a brief summary of the category as well as types of funds
available to investors. In order to help investors identify the
overall investment approach, mutual funds are classified into
categories based on their investment objectives and actual investment
practices. The descriptions of each type of fund are minimal and
will vary from one fund to another. Hopefully, they will provide
you with some sense of the different investment objectives you
can pursue through mutual funds.

<P>
Most mutual funds diversify their holdings
by buying a wide variety of investments that correspond to their
stated objectives. For example, a broadly diversified stock
fund might own stock in 100 different companies that provide different
products and services. There are also funds that are extremely
focused such as a precious metals or sector fund. A precious metals
fund buys mainly mining stocks; a sector fund buys shares in a
particular industry such as healthcare or technology.

<P>
For a detailed description, investors should
refer to each fund's prospectus, which provides a detailed
road map of the fund -- covering everything from its objective
and fees to its portfolio holdings and manager.

<P>
