<H2>POWER OF CAT'S CLAW</H2>
<P>   Cat's Claw, also referred to as "u&#241;a de gato", is the new North American leader in important medicinal plants and comes from the South American Peruvian Rainforest. Six oxindole alkaloids have been isolated in the inner bark of the plant and have been proven to provide a general boost to the immune system. Other alkaloids and phytochemicals (glycosides) present in Cat's Claw have been isolated and tested and are shown to provide pronounced natural anti-inflammatory benefits. As a true adaptogen with almost unlimited therapeutic applications, Cat's Claw has been called by experts as a "World Cluss Herb: a "Miracle Herb" and a "Sacred Herb of the Rainforest." Health care providers are now using it successfully with their arthritic patients for its anti-inflammatory and immune-stimulating properties.</P>
<P>    The alkaloid content of the Cat's Claw plant varies depending on quality. It ranges from 0.1% to 1.0% total alkaloids. Most Cat's Claw products contain as little as only 1 to 5 mg of alkaloids, which are actually bound to tannins. In Cats Claw bark, the alkaloids and tannins actually form a complex, which is not bioavailable without an acid to break it apart. The alkaloids contained in Life Plus CATAGESIC have been standardized, utilizing a proprietary process to not only contain 4% oxindole alkaloids but also break apart the alkaloid-tannin complex.  Very importantly, this makes the alkaloids 100% bioavailable.  Consequently, a full 8 mg of pure bioavailable oxindole alkaloids is contained in each CATAGESIC tablet. This is up to eight times more than other Cats Claw capsules sold today!</P>

<H2>SYNERGISTIC DYNAMIC RAINFOREST HERBS</H2>
<P> The principle rainforest herbs used for their synergistic effects  during  athletic  training  and  recovery  include Chuchuhuasi, Cat's Claw and Muira Puama because of their natural anti-arthritic, anti-rheumatic and anti-inflammatory properties.  Chuchuhuasi may well become the next highly important rainforest plant to follow Cat's Claw in the newest rainforest discoveries. A major pharmaceutical company is developing newly discovered phytochemicals found in Chuchuhuasi bark, which are highly anti-inflammatory. The indigenous name of this huge tree translates to "trembling bark", which describes the indigenous tribes century long use of the Chuchuhuasi for arthritis and rheumatism and which led modern day researchers to discover its properties.</P>
<P>   Suma is another powerful herb, which is by far the most well-researched. Studies dating back to 1968 reveal that Suma enhanced muscle building without producing the negative hormonal side effects steroids are noted for.  By 1976, Suma was labeled the "Russian Secret" when supplementation with Suma by the Russian Olympic team gave them the competitive edge in the 1976 Olympic games.</P>

<P>CATAGESIC contains a new proprietary standardized extract of Suma, which provides 5% Ecdysterones and Saponins. These are active ingredients found in Suma, which are thought to provide its benefits.</P>
<P>  Yerba Mate and Muira Puama are strong tonics and nervous system fortifiers; Maca and Yerba MatC are dynamic energy tonics used throughout the rainforest to increase stamina and endurance.  Sarsaparilla is used to support circulation, clear toxins and stimulate metabolism, while Iporuru nutritionally supports muscles and joints as well as provides natural analgesic. Cat's Claw and Sarsaparilla are both known for their oxygenating properties and Tayuya helps the body remove accumulating lactic acid in muscle tissue.  Tayuya also has well-known analgesic properties while Suma and Maca have a natural nutritional muscle building effect.</P>

<H2>UNLOCKING THE SECRETS OF THE RAINFOREST</H2> 
<P>In addition to supporting athletic performance and recovery, many of the plants in CATAGESIC have been used successfully by the indigenous tribes against symptoms of arthritis and rheumatism for centuries.   In addition to the plants being used for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties, the added benefits of increased stamina and energy, plus overall muscle toning and growth, could provide the arthritis sufferer with many beneficial effects.  Many secrets and untold treasures await discovery with the medicinal plants used by the indigenous people of the rainforest.  CATAGESIC, one of the great Life Plus RAINFORCE products, provides the ancient rainforest tribal secrets of improved energy, stamina, endurance and muscle growth as well as the secrets of the rainforest in the prevention of arthritis.</P>

<H2>PRESERVING THE RAINFOREST</H2>
</P>  All botanicals contained in CATAGESIC have been ecologically harvested by indigenous tribes to protect natural resources of the rainforest and it's people. Education and a new income source from harvesting sustainable natural resources, like the herbs contained in CATAGESIC and all Life  Plus  RAINFORCE  products,  helps  provide  an alternative to destroying our valuable rainforests.</P>

<P><B>Life Plus has pledged to give back from 5-10% of their profit to the peoples of the Rainforest by donating to organizations such as ACEER, Amazon Center for Environment, Education and Research, which works towards educating the children of the Amazon which will serve to help the Rainforest for generations to come!</B>

<H2>HOW TO USE CATAGESIC</H2>
<P>   Take one tablet twice a day between meals.  Drink plenty of water to assist the body's natural processes. During times of special need, two to three tablets, two to three times per day as needed.</P>
