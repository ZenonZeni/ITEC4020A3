<H1> Jim Downing's Racing Team </H1>

<H2> 24 Hours of Le Mans 1996, June 15th and 16th </H2>

<P> Jim Downing's team (incl. Y. Terada and F. Freon) finished 25th
after a five hour pit stop.  They won the LMP2 class.  The team was one
of 10 invited and so was exempt from pre-qualifying. They were the
Mazdaspeed team, car #20.

<H2> 24 Hours of Daytona 1996 </H2>

<P> Jim Downing led his Mazda Kudzu DLM No. 63 to third place in the
1996 24 Hours of Daytona, winning a purse of $24,850.  They <A HREF =
"http://www.p9.com/daytona_grid.html">started</A> at position 10 with a
time of 1:48.355.  The drivers were Jim Downing, Butch Hamlet, Tim
McAdam, and Barry Waddell.  They completed 697 laps.  Hamlet passed a
Porsche on the last lap to take third.  They might have placed higher
but not for a gearbox rebuild in the 21st hour.  Here is what two of the
drivers had to say:

<DL>

<DT> Jim Downing: <DD> We were in third place in WSC in the second
hour, at least briefly. Then we managed to shoot ourselves in the foot a
few times. We had a long stop when a gear tooth broke, we had a new
A-arm break, but nothing real big, other than the gearbox. I'm
thrilled. For a new car to make this distance is about all you can hope
for.

<DT> Barry Waddell: <DD> This was my first 24-hour race. The Downing
team has done this race a lot and they made my first stint at this very
comfortable. The car was very comfortable every stint I did,
particularly at the end, which was just as fast as at the beginning. The
car got better as the driver got better, and I enjoyed it a lot.

</DL>

<P> Hardy Haussecker's GTS-2 Pettit Racing Mazda RX-7 was <A HREF =
"http://198.133.164.203/Issues/4354.html">eliminated in the 24th
hour</A> when another driver hit the car.

<H2> 12 Hours of Sebring March 17, 1996 </H2>

<P> Downing, Hamlet, and Waddell drove the Mazda Kudzu DLM to fourth at
the 12 hours of Sebring March 17, after <A HREF =
"http://www.p9.com/sebring_grid.html">starting</A> in position 10.

<H2> Downing Mazda Kudzu </H2>

<P> Downing is manufacturer of the Kudzu chassis. <A
HREF="http://www.imsaracing.com/wsc/drivers/w.taylor.html">Wayne
Taylor</A> in 1994 was inaugural World Sports Car Champion, earning
seven top five and nine top ten finishes driving Downing's Mazda Kudzu
DG-3.
