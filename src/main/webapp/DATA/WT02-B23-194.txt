<p>This workshop will provide an overview of integrating technology with
a comprehensive curriculum and its application in a special education
setting or in an inclusion program. Participants can move among five
mini-demonstration classroom centers to learn how technology can support
instruction in the curriculum areas of science, technology and
engineering, social sciences, art, multimedia productions, and life
skills while using approaches such as cooperative learning and promoting
critical thinking skills. 
<ul>
<li>Through a collaboration of art and science and using programs such as
KidPix2 and Claris Works, students will learn about their environment and
the world they live in. <p>

<li>The technology education center will demonstrate problem solving
skills through the engineering of bridges. <p>

<li>Multi-media instruction using scanning devices will demonstrate how
to incorporate video and pictures into student reports. <p>

<li>Developing life skills with middle school students will be
demonstrated using "Choices and Decisions". <p>

<li>Laser Disk technology will be demonstrated in teaching science to
middle school students through cooperative learning. <p>

<li>All demonstrations will involve participation from the audience in
all centers.

<p><b>
Presenter:<br>
Philip Ciano</b>, LEGO Dacta, Waterford, WI
<p>Participants will engage in an introduction to simple machines using
LEGO Dacta materials to explore how they can be used in the classroom.
Hands on materials will be used to discover science concepts and extend
scientific knowledge by solving problems to real-life building challenges.
In addition, participants will be introduced to the LEGO Dacta control
materials by exploring controlled machines. To introduce the control lab
materials, the presenter will show how they can be used to introduce problem
 solving and control technology in an active, team-based way.
