<h2>Are You Aware?</h2>
There's been a flurry of activity at NewsNet during the past few months which has resulted in options for using NewsNet in new and different ways.  Of course, all new options will enhance your NewsNet experience, bringing results to you more quickly and easily than ever before.<P>

<B>Speedy Delivery</B><BR>
We've revved up the core system so that you will notice faster response time during search sessions (a tip for online users: check your modem speed and increase if necessary).  System response time is continuously monitored by Tom Scott, NewsNet's Vice President of System Services, and Mike Stein, NewsNet's Vice President of Software Development.  Together, Tom and Mike along with their conscientious and hardworking teams, provide you with optimum performance and relevant results when using NewsNet.<P>

<B>Just added to NewsNet on the Web</B><BR>
You asked for Project Tacking on the Web and we were proud to deliver within three weeks of receiving your request!  You can search NewsNet on the Web and be able to track specific projects or clients, therefore insuring accurate accounting requirements are met.  NewsNet Web subscribers were thanked for their ongoing support when Project Tracking was implemented over Thanksgiving weekend.  We at NewsNet were thankful that our holiday introduction of this new feature worked like a charm.<P>

You also requested 3N (NewsNet multi-Notation) for quicker retrieval and review of search results on the Web.  We agreed that this was a great suggestion and are pleased to announce 3N's general release.  3N is a real time saver, permitting headlines to be "noted" and retrieved as a group, rather than having to select and review one headline at a time.<P>

<B>Forgiven KWICs</B><BR>
"Forgiven KWICs" are available for NewsNet on the Web Users, and soon will be available for Baton and command line users as well.  You may be wondering what exactly are "forgiven KWICs."  Well, traditionally, when you've requested a KWIC (Keyword in Context) display from NewsNet, you have been charged a fee for the KWIC.  If you found the article relevant to your needs after viewing the KWIC, you requested the full-text and were charged a fee for the article too.  <P>

No more! <P>

In keeping with NewsNet's long tradition of adopting fair pricing policy practices, NewsNet will forgive the cost of the KWIC when full-text of the same article is purchased.  NewsNet Web subscribers will see an instant reduction in the price of the article when forgiven KWICs are triggered.  Baton and Command Line Users will notice credit adjustments to their invoices in the near future to accommodate forgiven KWICs.<P>

<B>NewsNet Hot Headlines</B><BR>
Visitors and subscribers alike are being treated to free Hot Headlines on NewsNet's new Web Welcome Page [www.newsnet.com/welcome].  NewsNet Web subscribers will notice a selection of new headlines every morning.  The selection covers breaking news, hot industries, and lifestyle trends of interest for that day (updated Monday through Friday) as chosen by a NewsNet editor.  Just click on the hypertext of the headline title to retrieve the free full-text version of the story.  "Hot" selections are drawn from anywhere in NewsNets entire database of 1,000 active sources!  Selections are not just limited to one or two newswires.<P>

<B>Quote.com brings added value to NewsNet on the Web</B><BR>
Complete your competitive intelligence research with free stock quotations from Quote.com, available at no charge right at NewsNet on the Web Welcome Page. Provide your clients a well-rounded picture of their competition--all from one place. NewsNet makes it easy to compliment your in-depth search results with timely monitoring of competitive stock positions.<P>

<B>Turn Your World Upside Down</B><BR>
Upside down is what we'd like you to try if youre not using NewsNet as your first source of current awareness, competitive intelligence or historical research.<P>

Many NewsNet Users (leading Fortune 500 companies) are telling us that,  increasingly, they find more and better materials searching NewsNet than from any other source, including the big names you're already familiar with.  Why?  All of us at NewsNet have been very busy adding new content, enhancing products, developing new features, continuing to provide excellent service and consultation, and listening to you so that we may serve you better.  So, what have you got to lose?  Shake it up--turn your world upside down--join your Working Knowledge colleagues already in the know and try NewsNet first.  You'll be happy you did! <P>
