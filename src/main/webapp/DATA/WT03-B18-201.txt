<h2>Impurity Transport in a Simulated Gas Target Divertor </H2>

<P>Previous experiments in the PISCES-A linear plasma device ( n < 3x10^19 m^-3, kTe < 20 eV) have indicated enhanced retention of impurities near the target in a simulated gas target
divertor as compared to a high recycling divertor regime. Preliminary impurity transport modeling, using a 1 1/2-D fluid code, shows that the impurities are impeded from transporting away from the simulated target by friction with both the neutral and ionized hydrogen. To further investigate the mechanisms of impurity transport, we are upgrading the PISCES-A experimental arrangement to include strong differential pumping to isolate the plasma source from the gas target region. This will allow us to seed the background hydrogen plasma with higher concentrations of impurities and investigate a regime dominated by impurity radiation. We are presently developing a spectroscopic detection system to simultaneously measure axial impurity density profiles of up to three charge states. This will provide us with more detailed experimental information for comparison to our impurity transport fluid modeling code.<P>This work supported by US-DoE contract DE-FG03-95ER-54301. <P>
