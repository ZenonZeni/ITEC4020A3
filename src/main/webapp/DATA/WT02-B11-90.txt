<P>July 5, 1996</P>
<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>     Latest unemployment data show that the nascent
recovery has had little impact on the stubbornly high jobless rate. Unemployment
is the electorate's top concern and the worry is real enough to translate into a
significant upturn in the traditionally low savings rate.  Radical Fernando de
la Rua is the first elected mayor of Buenos Aires. His margin of victory
trounced the Peronist incumbent, for whom President Menem had campaigned
vigorously.  Page 2</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>     Pressing financial needs have moved privatization of the
electric power sector into the fast lane.  Officials are leapfrogging the
question of how to divide Eletrobras and putting 11 of its holdings on the
block. The Sao Paulo government is reparceling its three power companies into 20
properties that will be sold.  BNDES is seeking to accelerate the ports'
privatization.   Concern about the stability of the real is mounting.  Page 3</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>     Government officials aren't hitting the panic button in
the face of the steep fall in copper prices &#150; yet.  Thanks to cautious
budgeting and ample reserves, the government claims it should not have to revise
its economic projections for 1996. However, it may have to revisit peso
management. The outlook for 1997 is highly dependent on just how deeply the
Sumitomo scandal damages the world copper market.  Page 4</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>     New tensions have erupted between the US and Colombia,
this time centered on air routes. The  dispute is ostensibly unrelated to either
the decertification of Colombia as a drug-fighting nation or the dismay at
President Samper's exoneration on corruption charges. But the combination of
pressures, heightened by new friction in the war on drugs, leaves little room
for positive developments.    A new liberalization of foreign investment rules
has been announced.    Banco Popular is again being readied for privatization. 
Page 5</P>
<P><B>CUBA</B>    The Helms-Burton Act is being taken seriously as the
centerpiece of US policy toward Cuba. Companies  like Cemex are leaving Cuba
rather than tangle with the legislation. Moreover, since the legislation shifts
control over the embargo from the president to congress, Cuba experts see little
chance for the embargo being lifted until Fidel Castro leaves power.  Page 6</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>     As it eyes a possible defeat for the ruling PRI in the
July 1977 elections, the finance ministry has  decided to go for economic growth
in the 7% range over the remainder of the sexenio rather than settling for just
5%, even if it means sacrificing inflation goals. The central bank appears
reconciled to this strategy.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>PERU  </B>    The latest electricity privatization, that of the northern
generating system, was won by Dominion Energy, which also has holdings in
Argentina and Bolivia. Next on the sales docket is southern region generator,
Egesur.    On the grounds of rooting out corruption, President Fujimori's
authoritarian streak has shown itself again, to the outrage of those who say his
high-handed tactics are undemocratic.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA</B>     A behind-the-scenes political fight over the future of
CVG and the sale of its huge aluminum,  steel and other holdings appears to have
been settled with the privatization goal still intact. At issue was a reform
proposal that could have had the effect of removing the Venezuelan Investment
Fund (FIV) from managing the asset sales, thus potentially undoing the years of
work FIV has already put into the process.  Page 9</P>
<P><B>PENSION REPORT/BRAZIL</B>     An examination of some of the issues
involved in changing the relationship  between the central government and the
pension funds run by state companies reveals just how confounding the problem of
pension reform is.  The state funds, handsomely funded from the federal purse,
are not only an emergency source of mega money for the latter, but a major buyer
of state assets as well.  Page 10</P>

VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1" WIDTH="300"><H2>BNDES, Sao Paulo State Ready to Push
Sale  Of Electrical Holdings</H2><P></P><P>Economic imperatives have prompted
a dramatic thrust in the privatization of the energy sector, both on the federal
and the state level. In a move that will greatly accelerate the sell-off of
individual Eletrobras power plants, the government has dispensed with the plan
to delay privatization until formal studies of how to divide the company's four
regional subsidiaries are complete. In Sao Paulo, the state assembly has decided
to regroup the state's three power companies into 20 different properties, most
of which will then be sold. </P><P><B>Eletrobras Plants For Sale. </B>In
moving ahead to sell off the Eletrobras plants, the National Bank for Economic
and Social Development (BNDES) is bypassing for now the thornier issue of how to
parcel out the subsidiaries, which are Eletronorte, Eletrosul, Chesf and Furnas.
The 11 plants tapped for sale are comprised of five Chesf concessions, one
Furnas concession, two Eletrosul concessions, and three Eletronorte concessions.
</P><P>Several thermoelectric plants were also included in the new BNDES plan,
including Eletronorte's isolated Amazon operations, which use subsidized oil
under a special scheme. The government estimates that the running costs of these
plants will be halved once they are sold by eliminating the restraints of
bureaucratic red tape, overemployment and the diversion of subsidized oil from
the market by municipalities and corrupt officials. The plan also includes the
217 MW Samuel hydroelectric plant in the Amazon, which needs $67 million to be
finished. The plan is one of 18 offered last year by Eletrobras to private
consortiums for completion.</P><P><B>Valuable Assets. </B>The move in Sao
Paulo will also help propel the federal program, given the state utilities' key
position in the national power grid. The three state companies, located in the
south-southeast-center west grid, are Centrais Eletricas de Sao Paulo (CESP)
with nearly $2.2 billion sales a year, Eletropaulo with $2.6 billion and
Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL) with just over $800 million yearly
sales. The state gas company Comgas is also included in the package. Together,
the companies account for about 40% of Brazil's energy take.</P><P>The three
utilities have assets of $19 billion, but they carry a debt burden of $12
billion. Selling the companies is expected to bring in about $5 billion to the
state treasury. The properties will be split into units according to the nature
of their operations. These units will then be regrouped into six generating
companies, 13 distribution companies and one unified transmission company. The
transmission company will remain under state control and administer the main
lines used by the various private generating and distribution companies, for
which it will charge a tariff. </P></TD><TD
VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="2" WIDTH="300"><P><B>State Maintains A Role. </B>A new
state holding company will be created with the chief task of managing the Sao
Paulo state privatization program. In addition to the power utilities, more than
50 state companies, including significant real estate assets, were listed for
sale. Under the plan passed by the state assembly, this holding will retain
golden shares of each privatized power utility, to guarantee the government's
say in energy planning decisions. </P><P>Sao Paulo governor Mario Covas is the
architect behind the plan, which is far more elaborately detailed and socially
concerned than the vague and contradictory proposals aired so far by BNDES and
other federal authorities for the national utilities. The plan calls for the
privatization of CESP to start with  distribution, which is less dependent on
the state bureaucracy since its market is the general population. By cutting
CESP down to size, the state hopes to allay the fears of potential bidders
regarding the dictates of a giant state company in determining long-term supply
contracts, spot market prices and transmission tariffs. </P><P><B>Geographic
Balance. </B>The current distribution network will be split into separate
companies so that each one comprises high- and low-income regions. CESP's
generating assets are to be divided into five companies, according to the five
major river basins of the CESP system, to permit coordinated management of each
river basin's water resources. </P><P>Eletropaulo, the largest Brazilian
electric utility in terms of sales, is almost exclusively an electricity
distributor. It will be split into eight independent companies, six of which
will be distributors, one that will concentrate the company's generating
capacity and another that will deal with transmission. CPFL serves mostly the
interior, including some very large energy consumers. </P><H2>BNDES Takes Over
Port Privatization</H2>
<P>Frustrated by the lack of progress in the ports privatization program, BNDES
has taken over the plan from the transport ministry. The BNDES then listed 31
ports for sale, including the key ports of Vitoria, Rio de Janeiro and the
sweeping complex at the port of Santos. </P><P><B>Incentive Plan. </B>The
impact of the move is hard to predict. While the privatization plan has been
proceeding under the careful study of the transport ministry, BNDES is offering
to boost the program with a special line of credit. The credit would apply to
winning concessionaires on the condition that all the money is invested to
upgrade and expand the ports.  </P><P></P></TD></TR>
