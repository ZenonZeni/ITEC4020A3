<H2>RAINFOREST BIO-ENERGETICS</H2>
<H2>THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF AMAZON JOHN</H2>

<P>It's not often you run headlong into a real story of adventure.  Even though it reads like an Indian Jones action novel, it's actually a true story of "Amazon John" Easterling and Rainforest Bio-Energetics@.  It's a story of adventure and discovery complete with lost civilizations, sacred sites, pre-Columbian treasure, ancient curses, near death experiences, and life saving botanicals from the Rainforest.  "Amazon John" is a degreed environmentalist and a lifetime member of the South American Explorers Club with 20 years experience and over I 00 trips into the jungle's interior.  His is a saga that includes many chapters of incredible encounters and fantastic discovery while other events are almost too intense to discuss.  Indeed there are still places in the world where fact is more phenomenal than fiction.
His life started off normally enough.  He was born to a typical American family, went to a typical American school and had a typical American boyhood, at least until the fateful day when "that" issue of The Weekly Reader arrived in his third grade classroom.</P>
<P>Each week, the publication featured a story about a young child from some exotic part of the globe.  On this day, it was Raul and his llama, high in the snow capped Andes mountains, "living the adventure" every day.  It was a story that captured young John's imagination and set his heart to beating like the drum of discovery.</P>
<P>As he learned of the Inca history, his mind raced with the possibilities - lost cities of untold wealth - advanced civilizations vanished off the face of the earth - scattered ruins deep in the jungle or hidden in the mountains, still living the "old ways".  He was awakened to a whole new world, and suddenly knew that this was to be his destiny.  He requested an immediate reassignment to Peru.</P>
<P>After graduating from college, with a degree in Environmental Studies, John sold his car and bought a ticket to Ecuador to begin his search for lost treasure.  From there, he traveled by bus through Peru and began to experience a special bonding with the South American continent.  To him, it was a land brimming with mystery, intrigue and opportunity.  Some highland Indians introduced him to the alpaca.  This high altitude relative of the llama is the central focus of native Andean life.  It has the softest and most durable wool of any animal on the planet.  He returned home with a handful of traditional handicrafts, woven by natives from the wool of the alpaca, and discovered that others also recognized the quality and value they represented.  Thus began his first importing business.</P>
<P>Over the next several years, John made many trips between North and South America.  He supported himself with his native handicrafts business, but was also able to spend months at a time exploring the ruins of Machu Picchu, Tiahuanaco, Tambo Machay, Paracas and Nazca.  He was finally living his dream, searching for lost treasure!  He learned a valuable secret--when you yield to the siren of adventure, your life takes on its true course and all the obstacles to your dreams are shattered.</P>
<P>Eventually he got into some ancient sites and began an avocation in Pre-Columbian textiles, dealing with museums and collectors around the world.  The search for lost cities led over the Andes and into the Amazon.  Going upriver he developed a trade in Amazon basin tribal artifacts.  The more time he spent in the Rainforest, the more he came to appreciate the Indigenous People's knowledge and heritage of Amazonian botanicals.</P>
<P>John's health had been compromised earlier in life with a serious bout of hepatitis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.  In fact, he had a near death experience from that in a hospital in North Carolina.  As a result, he suffered from chronic and long lasting periods of fatigue and. low grade fevers and compromised liver function.</P>
<P>Some Shipibo Indians on the headwaters of the Amazon shared some Ufia de Gato and Quebra Pedra teas with John.  After a few days of drinking this herbal combination, he felt an increased sense of balance and revitalization.  His energy returned.  His sense of groundedness, his mental acuity, everything improved not only to the point where he was before he was sick but to an even higher plateau of health where he had never been.  From that point on he maintained a personal stash of these herbs.</P>
<P>He continued making trips "upriver" collecting blowguns, carved monkey bones and other artifacts, not fully realizing that he had been introduced to the real treasure of Amazonia-the life force of the Rainforest itself.
After ten years and over 50 trips, he sold the business, Raiders of the Lost Art, with the intention of spending some time in Tibet.  He was planning one last trip through South America to stockpile his dwindling herb supply when, as the wheel of fortune spins, he reconnected with Nicole Maxwell.</P>
<P>Nicole is the author of "Witchdoctor's Apprentice," first published in 1961, and a dear friend of his.  She spent 40 years of her life doing research and collecting botanicals in the Rainforest of Peru.  He always enjoyed her wit and wisdom.  When she expressed an interest in returning to Peru, his new path became clear.  His consciousness shifted and he began to fully realize that the dense tropical jungle that he had grudgingly macheted his way through searching for lost treasure, was, in fact, itself the real treasure.  There came a realization that he was standing in the highest concentration of life energy on the planet.  Nicole's uncompromising spirit for life made her a wonderful travel companion and an invaluable source of inspiration.</P>
<H3>Sharing the Adventure</H3>
<P>Health care professionals whom he had known encouraged further exploration of the potential for traditional nutritional formulas from the Rainforest.  The Rainforest BioEnergetics@ Company was formed and an exciting cooperative effort was born.  Using the same diligence with when he had previously pursued ancient artifacts, Easterling committed himself to the Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ mission.</P>
<P>As products were shared and the benefits were experienced, more and more practitioners became involved in using Rainforest-Bio-Energetics@.  As the word spread from person to person, they began receiving calls from others requesting the products.  After researching modalities as to how best to expose these products to a larger audience, network marketing evolved as the natural choice, since this was in effect the way the information was being carried already.</P>
<P>Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ is a six year old, multimillion dollar company that is just now entering its "Acceleration Phase." The Company's mission is to create a new vision of Rainforest consciousness, planetary health and economic destiny.  It was founded around three simple principles which form a circle-adventure, discovery and empowerment.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@  Associates are encouraged to embark on an adventure of exploration, finding new possibilities for their own health of the planet.  They will discover the magical healing power of the concentrated life energy of the Rainforest and they will be empowered to bring new meaning into their lives, not only profitting themselves, but empowering the Indigenous People of the Rainforest to make decisions about their future.</P>
<P>The company's product formulas are based on traditional combinations that have been used by the Indigenous Peoples of Amazonia for may years.  Each individual herb has a long history of safe and successful use.  In addition, the Company has worked closely with hundreds of medical doctors, chiropractors, acupuncturists, nutritionists and athletic trainers since its inception to obtain a better understanding through carefully controlled observation, of how these nutritional supplements benefit those who use them.  This information has been used to fine tune the formulas in order to address the nutritional needs facing all health conscious people in modern society-Amazon John even goes further in explaining why these formulas are so necessary today.</P>
<P>The true value of the Rainforest botanicals lies not only in their rich nutrient value, trace minerals and phyto-pharmacological properties, but in the stored information of a thousand generations of ecological harmony.  When we consider the environmental chaos that seems to be accelerating-as evidenced by dramatic changes in weather patterns and seismic activity-perhaps the subtle energies of the Rainforest are what will nourish our awareness to the valued symbiotic balance at all levels of experience.  These Rainforest nutritional products are how being unveiled to a greater population as the consciousness for the real treasures of Amazonia comes of age.</P>

<H3>Preserving the Rainforest</H3>
<P>Herbs used in the Company's products are harvested with a respect for their natural environment.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ maintains a permanent company facility in the Amazon for collecting and grading raw material.  They work directly with the Indigenous People to ecologically harvest these herbal treasures.  When you are connected with Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ you know you are connected to the source.</P>
<P>The Company advocates the preservation of the Rainforests by promoting the use of sustainable and renewable botanical resources.  By creating an income stream for the herbs, we make the Rainforest more valuable alive than dead (clear cut).</P>
<P>The Indigenous People have an ultimate understanding of their ecosystems and have responded very favorably to the Company's approach.  This provides a morally and ecologically balanced framework to support their need for currency and our need for the mineral rich botanicals of the Rainforest.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ believes this type of exchange born of correct intent spawns a greater sharing and understanding between cultures.  Building these channels of trust and mutual respect with a common goal of individual and planetary health is an ongoing endeavor and the corporate mission.</P>
<P>In addition to the way the Company conducts their business securing raw materials, they return 1% of all net sales to the Rainforests through their Rainforest Rescue Fund.  Each Associate in the Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ network can feel satisfaction knowing that they are doing their part and that creating sufficient demand for Rainforest products is necessary for preservation efforts to succeed.</P>
<P>All company literature and correspondence is printed on recycled paper.  They use soy-based ink and encourage recycling all bottles and packaging material.</P>
<P>The formulas are processed under exacting standards.  The active herbal agents are concentrated using its proprietary process, which emphasizes the "whole" nutritional complement of the plant.  The method of botanical preparation sometimes referred to as "plant alchemy" is based on ancient bioenergetic principles.  To maximize bioavailability, most of the extracts are presented in liquid form.  This process is an integral part of the Company's objective to deliver the full and complete bioenergetic properties of the Rainforest.  When added to pure water, they create excellent teas. </P>
<P>Una de Gato, or "Cat's Claw" serves as a base for many of the Company's products.  Una de Gato is referred to by
many as the most important botanical of our time.  Rainforest Bio-Enerc,etics@ first introduced this incredible herb to U.S. doctors in 1991, predicting it would become a legend.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ is the leading importer of Ufia de Gato and guarantees the highest quality.  There are other Rainforest herbs which are well known such as Pau d'Arco, Suma, and Stevia and many more destined for the spotlight such as Muira Puama and Chuchubusasi.  IlluminationTM, which is the flagship product, is a combination of the premier botanicals of the Rainforest into a single synergistic formula.  It contains Una de gato, pau d'arco, suma, tayuya and 29 other herbal components.  Other products are Arcozon Calmazon, Digestazon, Envirozon, Metabazon, Lunazon, Warrior, Recovazon, Suma, and Una de Gato.  For many of these products, the names are suggestive of their benefits.  Excellent Company literature provides ample additional information.</P>

And the Warrior Bonus Pool of 2% of total company monthly sales is shared by top performers on a Pro-rata basis.</P>
<P>In order to help distributors earn money quickly, a weekly Quick Start Bonus of $ 100 is paid to sponsors on each newly sponsored Associates purchase of an optional Quick Start Kit.  This consists of over $500 in Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ products, purchased for only $300.  This represents more than a 40% discount for the new Associate.  Power growth is made easy by the use of the revolutionary Fast Tract 500 business building program.  Rainforest Bio-Energetics@ has developed an exciting audio brochure on cassette tape that will make your telephone ring with new prospects.
