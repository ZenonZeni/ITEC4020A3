AGWEEK MAGAZINE EDIBLE BEAN MARKET COLUMN

By Ann Bailey, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--HIGHLIGHTS: The edible bean market remained in the holiday doldrums
last week, with Minnesota and North Dakota dealers quoting pinto prices of $14
per cwt. and navy prices of $15 per cwt. 

Looking ahead to the new crop, there were contracts of $18 per cwt. for navies
and $16 per cwt. for pintos available. 

DEMAND: On the demand side, the devalued peso continues to make it tough to
sell pinto beans to Mexico. In February, the country will issue permits to 
companies to buy pintos. Under NAFTA, Mexican buyers can purchase up to 1.2 
million cwt. of beans, duty-free. 

If Mexico's economic situation improves and the country is able to purchase
the beans, it would help clean up the supply of U.S. pintos on hand, 

says Tim Courneya, executive vice president of the Northarvest Bean Growers 
Association. 

With pinto and navy beans at inexpensive levels, the United States should also
continue to move out beans through the U.S. government's Food for Peace 
Program, Courneya says. However, there may be competition with green peas and 
lentils for exports because those legumes are even cheaper than navies and 
pintos. END

BEAN PRODUCTION UP, BUT SUNFLOWER CROP DIPS FOR YEAR

By Ann Bailey, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--One thing edible bean growers can pretty much count on is that the
market is cyclical: If prices are high one year, farmers are likely to plant
more beans the next year, and prices will drop. 

The cycle continued this year when U.S. farmers increased their navy bean 
production by 2.1 million cwt. to 7.3 million. Prices in the region dropped 
from $26-$27 per cwt. a year ago to $14 per cwt. this year. 

North Dakota farmers harvested 149,000 navy acres this year, up 129,000 acres
from last year when flooding and frost destroyed some acres, according to
USDA. Harvested acreage in Minnesota increased by 20,000 acres to 61,200, 
the agency says. 

N.D. navy production was 2 million cwt. this year, up from 1.5 million from a
year ago. Minnesota farmers produced 845,000 cwt. of navies, up from 678,000
last year. 

U.S. pinto bean acreage, meanwhile, dropped from last year. Farmers harvested
760,000 acres of pintos nationwide, about 70,000 fewer than last year. But in
North Dakota and Minnesota, acreage was higher than last year. Farmers
harvested 362,000 acres, a 35,000 acre increase over last year. Minnesota
farmers harvested 35,000 acres, 10,400 more than last year. 

Nationwide, U.S. pinto bean production was 11 million cwt. this year, down 1.6
million cwt. from last year. North Dakota farmers produced 4.7 million cwt. of
pintos, 424,000 cwt. more than last year, USDA says. Minnesota pinto
production increased 138,000 cwt. to 433,000. 

Pinto bean prices in the region, at about $15 per cwt. are similar to last
year. 

Adverse weather conditions hurt Northern Plains sunflower production this year.

USDA projects that North Dakota's average yields of both oil and nonoil 
sunflowers will be 1,360 pounds per acre, down 75 pounds per acre from last 
year. Total North Dakota "all sunflower" production is pegged at 2 million 
pounds, down from 2.2 million last year. 

Final figures for the year aren't available yet, but the National Sunflower
Association anticipates that North Dakota's oil yields will be lower than
USDA's projections, says Jay Hesley, marketing director of the National
Sunflower Association. 

Late planting, a shorter growing season and poor harvest conditions 
contributed to lower yields, he says. Some of this year's crop was planted a 
week to 10 days later than normal. 

In Minnesota, a wet growing sseason that spawned crop diseases reduced yields.
Hesley expects yields will be lower than the five-year average of 1,480 pounds
per acre. USDA projects average yields of both non-oil and oil sunflowers in
Minnesota to be 1,250 pounds per acre this year, down 13 pounds per acre from
last year. Total production in Minnesota is pegged at 558,750 pounds, down
41,250 pounds from last year. 

In South Dakota, USDA projects average yields of 1,380 per acre for both 
non-oil and oil sunflowers. That's a decline of 171 pounds per acre from last 
year. USDA projects total South Dakota production at 1.3 million pounds, down 
from 1.4 million last year. 

Total U.S. production of non-oil and oil sunflowers will be 4.6 million pounds,
down from 4.8 million last year, USDA projects. 

While yields are lower than last year, prices are higher. Prices are near 11
cents a pound, nearly 2 cents higher than last year. Hesley says the reason is
twofold: Farmers are reluctant sellers and buyers are trying to give farmers
an incentive to plant sunflowers this spring. Sunflowers will have to compete
with other commodities for acreage, Hesley says. END

DAKOTA FARMER'S AGRIDATA INC. CREATES FIELD INFORMATION SYSTEM

By Jayson Menke, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--David Hagert wanted to find an easier way to keep field information.
So he designed a management information system. Hagert, who farms 2,700 acres
of wheat, barley, soybeans and edible beans with his brother, Curtis Jr., near
Emerado, N.D., started working on a model in his basement in the winter of
1991, and moved to his current location at 2600 Demers Ave. in Grand Forks,
N.D, in May. 

Since going into business, AgriData Inc., has branched out into more than just
field records, it now focusus on all areas of precision farming. 

The business assists farmers with precision farming techniques by utiliziation
of an improved field recordkeeping system that integrates computer analysis,
automated data entry, mapping, field monitoring and Differential Global
Positioning Satellite technology. 

"By broadening our horizons we are able to provide customers with the lastest
equipment, software and information in one convenient location," Hagert says. 

Hagert has incorporated tillage, fertilizer, pesticide, planting, conservation
determination, weather, harvest, irrigation and soil nutrient data and maps
into two pages of information for one field for one year. 

"In the past you would have about eight pages of printed out data per field.
What we're doing is simplifying and tying everything together," Hagert says. 

Hagert's goal was to develop an easy-to-use computer system that would service
all aspects of farming. 

In the early stages of development he used speadsheets to post his farm 
records. 

His new software program, Field Facts, will be available in the mid- January. 

Farmers can purchase Field Facts from AgriData and receive training on the
software or they can gather the data and AgriData will process the information
and print it out for the farmer. 

Hagert says that precision farming endorses site specific application of crop
inputs. 

According to Hagert the goal of precision farming is to improve profits by
putting money spent on crop inputs exactly where it will do the most good. 

"The main focus is establishing patterns that are determined by yield 
monitoring equipment, satellite imagery and soil types," Hagert says. 

Hagert says the premise is that fields have varying patterns of soil types,
nutrient levels, and ultimately, varying yield levels through out a given
field. By recording and analyzing this data, crop inputs can be adjusted
through out a field to maximize yeilds and reduce total cost of inputs. 

That is, a constant rate of application over an entire field results in over
application in some spots and under application in others. By varying the
appliation rate of applications, costs can be reduced and yeilds increased. 

Hagert started keeping track of records on ACSC maps and began charting more
intensely in 1988 and designed the first prototype in 1991. 

"The main emphasis is on collecting data," Hagert says. He and his brother
used a yield monitor in 1994 and last year added a correctional signal which
enables the farmer to pinpoint spots in field through differential global
positioning system. 

"Now we can produce yield maps and look at it with satellite imagery and look
for patterns." 

AgriData will offer record keeping support, mapping, satellite imagery, 
software sales and support and consultation on hardware. 

AGRIDATA INC. Owner: David Hagert Address: 2600 Demers Ave., Grand Forks, N.D.
Year started: 1991. Employees: 4. Main line of work: Precision farming
management system. Motto: Bringing precision farming down to earth.

AGWEEK MAGAZINE EDITORIAL: OPENING THE DOORS

Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY AWAITS PRAIRIE AGRICULTURE Jan. 1--Whirlpool, a
leading maker of home appliances based in Benton Harbor, Mich., is one of a
number of Midwest manufacturers that has set its sights on the global market
everyone in agriculture is talking about. 

As Prairie farmers grapple with the challenges of more economically liberal
farm policy, and tackle the business world through processing and marketing
ventures, a look at Whirlpool's global adventure suggests that strategic
planning and focused energy can be bountifully rewarded. 

In its transformation from a domestic supplier into a world-class competitor,
Whirlpool evolved from a $4 billion company into an $8 billion company. In a
recent interview with Suzanne Cosgrove at Knight-Ridder Financial News,
Whirlpool CEO David Whitwam recalled that the company was devoted almost
exclusively to the U.S. marketplace in 1987 when he took his current position. 

While solidly successful, Whirlpool faced a mature environment, with only slow
natural growth -- based on population growth -- seen for the coming decade.
Whitwam concluded that the only reason it was a slow-growth industry was that
it was limited to domestic markets. 

It was time to go global. Whirlpool recognized that, while a fridge is a 
fridge is a fridge, you don't just export American-style appliances to Brazil 
and expect to reap a fortune. 

Today, Whirlpool is the No. 3 appliance supplier in Europe, and the No. 1 
supplier in both North and Latin America. 

Now it's on to Asia. Whitwam figures the Asian market will be twice the size
of U.S. market within 10 years -- as big as Europe and the United States 
combined. When asked what new language he would learn if he had time, Whitwam 
was quick to answer: "Mandarin." 

There are ample lessons for Prairie farmers in this stellar example. Stoves
aren't soybeans, but the principles of marketing and competing in new markets
are. 

The most important factor is focus, or "stick to your knitting." In other 
words, if you're selling processed flour products into the Chinese market, 
don't spin you wheels trying to sell tractor tires. 

Unlike appliances, foodstuffs are a much more fractured and diverse market. So
market research is essential. That includes building relationships that
eventually turn into deals. But where some folks look at market research as
daunting, successful ventures don't go adrift into the information sea without
a plan. 

First, know your own products, your own production potential and your own 
reserves of creativity. 

Second, have your money lined up -- nothing quite limits business 
opportunities as failing to meet contracted output quotas because you run out 
of cash. 

Third, have fun. The world market is exciting, interesting and challenging.
Prairie farmers have an unbeatable combination of a highly productive resource
base, a solid experience pool from which to draw, a lively economic
development sector, and the drive to create new business models for the next
century. 

There are those individuals who would have looked at the refrigerator market
and said, "I guess we'll have to make do with what we've got." But innovators
like Whitwam looked farther afield and saw a chance to build on their base. 

The world market wants good food. China is hungry, Russia is hungry, all of
Asia is hungry. And they're all building to a standard of living that we in
the United States saw before World War II. That means opportunity. This is the
year for Prairie farmers to look beyond their borders, to scan the global 
horizon for opportunities and to build relationships that will guarantee our 
future prosperity. 

It's time, in Whitwam's words, to learn Mandarin. EDITOR'S NOTE: Agweek

MEAT PRODUCTION SWELLED IN 1995

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--Livestock producers know only too well what this year's hot grain 
markets mean: fatter feed and forage costs, leaner margins. 

The rise in corn prices, which has encouraged increased oilseed meal 
production, has not triggered a major selloff. Instead, meat production 
swelled in 1995. 

There's not shortage of meat these days. In fact, from the cattleman's 
standpoint, notes a Market Watch For Beef from the National Cattlemen's 
Assocation, supplies are burdensome. 

Increased beef production has led to record U.S. per capita meat consumption,
but it hasn't been enough to turn the cattle market around from its yearlong
slump. 

NCA economists say lower retail prices continue to encourage consumption, 

but the bad news is a cyclical increase in cattle and beef production will 
keep pressure on prices. However, though prices on the hoof are still $10 to 
$20 per cwt. below levels seen in 1993 and 1994, the market this fall has 
started to rebound. 

"Fed cattle supplies tightened considerably during early fall and pushed fed
cattle prices into the upper $60 per cwt. by late November," notes James 
Mintert, a livestock economist at Kansas State University-Manhattan. Although 
cattle slaughter is expected to remain above last year's level through the end
of the year, it looks like slaughter supplies will remain tight enough through
the end of 1995 to support fed cattle prices in the mid- to upper- $60s. 

Mintert notes that breakeven prices for the last quarter of 1995 for 750- 
pound steers and 650-pound heifers are projected at $68.50 to $69.50, $2 to $4
per cwt. more than live cattle are fetching at key terminal markets such as
the Texas Panhandle. The rise in average breakeven is due almost exclusively
to this year's rapid runup in grain, oilseed meal and hay prices. Each $10 per
ton change in hay prices, Mintert says, changes feeding cost of gain by 55
cents per cwt. 

As of Nov. 30, there were 8.7 million cattle on feed in the top seven 
producing states, up from the year-ago level of 8.63 million head, and still 
ahead of the five-year Nov. 30 average of 8.64 million head. On-feed 
inventories peaked in April at 8.99 million head, according to USDA. 

The government notes its quarterly view that the number of cattle on feed in
the top 13 states as of Oct. 31 was up 2 percent from a year earlier and is
the second largest for that date since 1975. Feedlot placement in September
rose sharply before declining slightly in October, but are likely to remain
above year-ago levels. Marketings are expected to continue to remain above
year-ago levels into 1996. 

USDA estimates 1995 total U.S. beef production at 25.124 billion pounds, up
from 24.358 billion last year. 

A surge in beef exports will continue, which is a major positive influence on
U.S. beef prices. U.S. beef exports this year hit a record 1.88 billion pounds,
17 percent more than last year. 

More beef entering the domestic market would keep pushing prices down. Average
retail beef prices dropped 2 percent in 1995, according to USDA, and could
drop another 2 percent in 1996. The average retail beef price in 1995 checked
in at $2.60 per pound, with sale prices averaging $2.40 per pound. 

Most cow-calf producers this year experienced their first sizable losses since
1986, according to the National Cattlemen's Association. Most operators will
be unprofitable for another two or three years, and some will leave the 
business, the group says. END

AGWEEK MAGAZINE JUAN MIGUEL PEDRAZA COLUMN

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

RURAL STATES MUST INVEST IN AG RESEARCH, MARKETING Jan. 1--When she takes
over as head of the Northern Crops Institute Jan. 15, Patricia Berglund has a
good dea what she's getting into. The North Dakota State University scientist
sees big times ahead for NCI and other research and marketing organizations in
a post-farm bill world. 

There's no doubt about it -- as governments worldwide ratchet back farm 
spending, farm income will increasingly depend on the markets. What does that 
mean exactly and where do NCI and similar organizations fit in? 

Eventually every penny you earn from every bushel you grow will come from the
price you get at the elevator. Two things come to mind: One, the elevator 
cannot be your sole source of income. Two, to make more money on what you grow,
you'll have to add value to it. On a community level, that means capturing
more of the market's dollars and retaining them at home, rather than exporting
that value to someone who'll cash it all in down the line in Minneapolis or
Chicago. 

NEW STATE OF MIND: As we shift our thinking from farm policy debates into the
real world of business and finance, the ag community must refocus its efforts
at home. That means substantially more local support for organizations like
NCI, Minnesota's Agricultural Utilization and Research Institute and Kansas
State University's international grains institute. 

Here's where the going might get rough. Though we appreciate the efforts of
policy research groups like congressionally funded Food and Agriculture Policy
Research Institute, in the real world where every dollar of profit must be
sweated from the market, their work will be increasingly marginalized. 

In other words, we're looking for real-world products and marketing ideas, not
long-range forecasts. The tough decision will come in apportioning a shrinking
pot of dollars among policy-oriented and market-oriented research facilities.
As we look to our bottom lines, the market-oriented organizations should
likely win the lion's share of that money. 

BREAD AND BUTTER PRACTICALITY: We need economists to give us some sense about
what we're doing, but the fact is over the past 50 years -- since economic
forecasting first became popular in the post-Keynesian world -- economists
have racked up a dismal record for accuracy. When you're looking to butter
your bread, you need less think-tanking about policy and a lot more practical
ideas about where the bread and butter are. 

That's great news for Berglund and NCI, and their colleagues at other 
market-oriented research and promotion organizations. But they won't get their
meal tickets without a fight. Whatever else she's got on her plate, 

Berglund and other NCI-type leaders will have to set aside a significant chunk
of time and energy to lobby local legislatures, farm groups and development
authorities to make sure that they can continue their vital work. 

After all, in a free market, everyone has to compete. And unless you can prove
you've got what it takes to make money, you're not likely to get much money. 

From our vantage point here, we see tremendous potential for NCI, for 
Agricultural Utilization and Research Institute, for the land grant colleges 
in our area, to materially contribute to the future success of the many 
agribusiness ventures that have yet to sprout. Whatever else we do with our 
money, we need to assure that Berglund and her colleagues nationwide get what 
they need to help us succeed.

PORK PRODUCERS HAVE RECORD YEAR IN '95

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--America's pork producers cranked out a record 17.86 billion pounds
this year, a bit more than last year's 17.7, but well below the 18.5 billion
pounds projected earlier this year. 

The numbers reflect lower market hog inventories this year, connected in part
to the rapid inflation in feed costs. Cash break-even prices are projected to
average in the low $40s per cwt. and are likely to continue rising this winter,
according to USDA economist Steve Reed. 

But despite rising grain prices, Reed says, producers are on gradually 
expanding their herds again. The number sows farrowing from September through 
next February is projected to be about the same as a year earlier. However, a 
larger pig crop is likely during this period since more pigs are being saved 
per litter. 

The good news for pork, like in beef, is exports. Record pork exports last
year had a significant impact on the industry's bottom line. 

Export sales of U.S. pork and pork variety meats in 1994 accounted foir about
6 percent of the wholesale value of total U.S. pork production, up from 5.3
percent in the early 1990s and six times what exports meant to pork industry's
bottom line a decade ago, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. 

A USMEF-sponsored study shows that hog prices in the United States benefit
substantially from increased overseas demand for U.S. pork. Total export sales
of pork last year added $3.32 per cwt. to the value of slaughter hogs, up from
a 79-cent contribution 10 years ago. 

U.S. pork exports last year totaled a record 284,000 metric tons, or 626 
million pounds, and are expected to stay on track this year. The industry's 
growth in foreign markets is just beginning, says USMEF's Philip Seng. 

"We see potential for U.S. pork export sales of more than $1.2 billion in the
year 2001, and that's just around the corner," he says. 

That foreign demand for pork has kept hog prices steady through the 
traditional early winter market decline, according to the S.D. Pork Producers 
Council. Top market hogs sold for up to $46.75 a cwt. in Sioux Falls last week,
the highest price since October. It was more than $18 higher than the 
late-November drop in 1994 when top hogs in Sioux Falls sold for $28.50. 

"Historically, right after Thanksgiving is pretty much the seasonal low in our
markets," says Hurley farmer Steve Schmeichel, president of the South Dakota
Pork Producers Council. "The good news is that's been here and past." 

Schmeichel says an active export market and increased slaughter capacity at
packing houses helped keep pork moving at good prices. For the first time in
more than 40 years, the United States was a net exporter of pork this year. 

And pork exports should continue to increase along with the world population,
said Tom Farnsworth of Madison, executive secretary of the pork producers. 

"When you look outside the United States, pork is the meat of choice," 
Farnsworth says. "We expect our pork exports to triple in the next three to 
four years."

SOYBEAN PRICES STAGE YEAR-END RALLY

By Juan Miguel Pedraza, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--The soybean market is traditionally the most volatile of all the ag
commodities except maybe pork bellies. This year, beans were the laggards, 
with production numbers limiting the rally. 

Eventually, though, the market caught up with the reality in field: U.S. 
output was shortened by moisture, though not as badly as other crops. USDA has
estimated the U.S. 1995 soybean harvest at 2.183 billion bushels, down 13 
percent from 2.731 billion the previous year. 

That redution, not as dramatic as the plunge in corn output, set the stage for
a big year-end rally linked to drought in Brazil, the world's No. 2 soybean
exporter. The result is that farmers are feeling bullish, holding onto what
they've got and forcing the market to push bids up to pry loose available
supplies. 

Some merchants believe farmers have set a near-term goal of $7.50 a bushel for
soybeans, with handful of diehard bulls calling for double-digit dollar
figures for soybeans by spring. Soybeans have traded above $10 a bushel only
once this century, following the discovery in the 1972 to '73 season of the
Pacific Ocean current warming system known as El Nino. 

USDA economists aren't that optimistic, but they do argue that strong domestic
demand and energetic overseas buying are supporting U.S. soybean prices.
USDA's November supply-demand report pushed the average farmgate price of
soybeans for 1995 to '96 at $6.30 to $7.30 per bushel, up from $5.45 per
bushel last season and an average of $6.40 in 1993. 

The action in soybeans has pushed up prices all across the oilseed front, 
with sunflowers, safflower and canola all enjoying rallies this year. 

World vegetable oil prices continued relatively strong this year, though the
crush for meal following sharply increased feed grain prices has caused a 
short-term glut of vegoil in many markets. 

USDA says soymeal prices will average $197.50 to $222.50 per short ton (10
cents to 11 cents per pound), well ahead of year-ago levels. Still, because
the soymeal-to-corn price ratio remains favorable, and because livestock
(especially pork and poultry) output is rising, the government sees modest
growth in demand for meal. 

On the oil side, the equation is not as good largely because China, the big
buyer in 1995, has sharply curtailed purchases this year. The Chinese have
planted and harvested high-oil content crops, including soybeans, peanuts and
sunflowers and they still have stocks left over from last year's vegoil import
binge, USDA says. END

AGWEEK MAGAZINE COWBOY LOGIC COLUMN

By Ryan M. Taylor, Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

NEW YEAR'S FORTUNE: SAVINGS AND SATISFACTION AHEAD TOWNER, N.D.--Jan. 1--I
was a little worried about my financial future after tallying up my year end
pluses and minuses. The bottom of my tally sheet had a pretty sizable number
inside a pair of brackets -- brackets mean a big fat minus and denote red ink
for those of us without a color printer. 

But then I got a letter in the mail and all my financial fretting flew right
out the window. The folks at Fortune magazine were ready to lend me a hand and
extend to me the tools necessary to make 1996 a banner year for both me and my
banker. 

I had no fear that this might be a letter they'd send to just any over- 
extended rancher in Smokey Lake (N.D.) Township. The letter said, "We're 
conducting a nationwide search to attract leading business professionals and 
key decision-makers, and your name was referred to us from the Towner City 
(N.D.) area." 

Wow! All those leading business professional to choose from in the entire U.S.
of A. and little ol' me was referred by the Towner (population 669) City area!
It's not often that us Towner suburbanites in Smokey Lake Township get 
referrals from the big wigs in the Towner City area. Not for everybody 

This offer definitely wasn't for just any Jack out in the countryside. The
envelope said, "The enclosed Professional Discount Voucher is for the express
use of the person named herein and is nontransferable." 

The publisher had authorized Brian Wolfe, consumer marketing director, to give
me 74 percent off the newsstand price, send me a free guide full of 
breakthrough ideas and unconventional tactics, and guarantee my satisfaction 
because of my "status as a business professional" (in the Towner City area). 

I could see that making that kind of offer to the general public would 
probably lose fortune's for Fortune magazine. But cutting someone like myself 
in on the deal made a lot of sense. 

I'm sure their advertisers would be phoning in almost immediately and 
increasing their promotional budget with them once the big orders started 
rolling in from the Taylor Ranch. 

Brian said Fortune would help me grow my business (heavier calves and taller
grass), motivate my staff (optimistic cows and horses chomping at the bit,
ready to work), and maintain my edge (not settling to be just another broke
cattleman, but be the best damn broke cattleman there is). What the heck 

Even with the professional rate, I had second thoughts about spending any 
money on anything, what with the cattle market down in the basement and all. 
You can't fall for every smooth talking salesman whose snake oil, or magazine 
subscription, will cure all ills. 

But, then again, like Oscar Wilde said, a cynic is someone who knows the price
of everything and the value of nothing. 

So, without cynicism, the new year brings new optimism, new hope and, most
importantly, a new operating loan. A professionally discounted Fortune 
magazine subscription could be the first chip off the old 1996 borrowed 
capital block. 

Besides, I spotted the little box to check that said "Bill me later." It's a
popular option for us leading business professionals in the Towner City area.

WEATHER HAMPERED FALL POTATO HARVEST IN PARTS OF MINNESOTA, NORTH DAKOTA

Agweek Magazine 
Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News 

Jan. 1--Weather conditions varied in North Dakota and Minnesota producing 
record crops in some areas and below average crops in other areas. 

The 1995 fall potato harvest was hampered, especially in northwestern 
Minnesota and parts of North Dakota by rain and sloppy fields. The weather 
kept some growers harvesting late into the fall, while others had to abandon 
fields. 

Storage has also been a problem for growers who may have harvested late blight
infected potatoes. Those potatoes are more susceptible to diseases like soft
rot that can cause potatoes to breakdown in storage. 

Late blight was especially prevalent in irrigated potatoes. Growers will
continue to closely monitor storage bins to try to head off any problems. 

Growing conditions in North Dakota throughout the year weren't good enough to
match the record breaking yields harvested in 1994. 

Some growers blamed hot temperatures in June and too much rain in July for the
smaller yields. 

Yields averaged 210 hundredweight per acre in 1995, down from the record 235
cwt. per acre harvested in 1994. 

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, North Dakota production 
totaled 25.4 million hundred pound bags of potatoes in 1995, compared to 28.2 
million cwt. the previous year. North Dakota growers harvested 121,000 acres 
in 1995, compared to 120,000 acres the previous year. Record breaking year 

But the reverse occured in Minnesota where growers harvested record yields on
their summer and fall crops in 1995. 

Minnesota growers dug up record yields in 1995 averaging 270 cwt. per acre,
which was slightly higher than the previous record of 269 cwt. per acre set in
1994, according to USDA. Minnesota growers produced 20.8 million cwt. in 1995,
compared to 20 million cwt. the previous year. Harvested acreage in Minnesota
was pegged at 77,000 acres, up from 74,600 acres in 1994. 

Total U.S. fall and summer potato production was down in 1995 at 402 million
cwt., compared to 426 million cwt. produced in 1994. Yields averaged 334 cwt.
per acre, down from 352 cwt. per acre the previous year. 

The smaller U.S. crop has kept Red River Valley prices higher in 1995 than the
previous year. 

According to USDA's Market News, prices for No. 1 size A washed round red 
potatoes are at $8.50 to $9 per cwt., compared to $7 to $7.50 per cwt. for the
same time period time in 1994.
