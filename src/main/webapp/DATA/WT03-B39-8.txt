LLOYDS BANK MAY SELL OFF MAJOR SHAREHOLDING IN SMH

LLOYDS BANK has refused to comment on reports that it will sell its
majority shareholding in Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst (SMH), the leading
German private bank.

Eberhard Weiershauser, one of the managing partners at SMH, also denies
the reports. He believes the current surge of speculation about a sale
was triggered by the leak of a confidential study from Merrill Lynch,
which last month made an unsolicited presentation to Lloyds Bank
advising on the possible divestment of SMH. "We have to contend with
these rumours every three months," Weiershauser said.

Although it is not the first time Lloyds has apparently considered the
sale of its 75 percent of SMH, on this occasion various circumstances
suggest that the time is right.

According to the Merrill Lynch presentation report, there are a number
of international banks which could be considering the sale of their
German private banking subsidiaries in the short and medium term.

Germany's new regulations on capital adequacy and capital backing for
derivatives business, and in particular the new rules on minimum
volumes for trading business, all place the viability of smaller German
banks in question, Merrill Lynch said.

The additional work and expenditure necessary to tackle these
challenges would induce many banks to seek a strong parent bank to
finance the necessary investments in edp and personnel, or else to
withdraw from certain businesses.

Another dilemma is that some of the exclusive and confidential services
which are the hallmark of German private banks can no longer be
provided under the new legislation. German banks are now obliged, for
instance, to pass on suspicions of insider trading.

But the crucial argument of Merrill Lynch's presentation was that SMH
is better placed than most to tackle these difficulties. SMH is
particularly attractive to potential purchasers, according to Merrill,
because of its above-average financial performance, excellent market
reputation and highly professional management team.

The bank has operated its own international capital markets business
for some years and has the expertise to comply with the new capital and
trading regulations without any real difficulty, Merrill added.

Nevertheless, Lloyds will be aware that several other big banks have
suffered losses and embarrassment from their German private banking
subsidiaries. Barclays' Merck, Finck, lost substantial sums over
several years and humiliated its shareholders by publishing profit
figures for 1993 before having to admit that the bank had made a loss
after all.

Recently it has been rumoured that Grunelius Privatbankiers, the tiny
private bank owned by Deutsche Bank, will also be sold off or even
disbanded. In 1994, Grunelius' assets shrank by nearly 14 percent to
DM206 million ($143 million). Commissions income fell while
administrative expenses rose, culminating in a net loss of DM1.8
million. Managing Director Gerd Schmitz- Morkramer left several months
ago and has not yet been replaced.

But if Lloyds is indeed considering a sale of SMH, which it acquired in
1984, the reasons would probably lie with its own strategy.

It is telling that Lloyds, which has never been a major international
investment house, has always operated SMH at arm's length as a
non-consolidated subsidiary. But Lloyds has recently amended its
strategy and foreign capital markets subsidiaries no longer seem to fit
in at all.

Lloyds is now aiming to focus on the mass market at home and hopes to
become the strongest and most profitable institution in UK retail
banking. The recent merger with the TSB retail bank followed takeovers
of the Cheltenham & Gloucester building society and the insurer Abbey
Life. Rather than retaining SMH which is engaged primarily in upscale
German private banking and capital markets business - Lloyds could sell
and use the proceeds of sale to pursue its new strategic aims.

In the light of Lloyds' new strategy, it is clear that the profitable
shareholding in SMH which could be divested to another large financial
institution without stiffening competition in Lloyds' core UK market.

Traditionally, Lloyds has included in its core business any subsidiary
which generates return on equity of at least 15 percent. SMH achieved
net return on equity of more than 27 percent in 1993, but slipped back
to 3.3 percent the following year as a result of depleted commissions
income. Weiershauser indicated that commissions income had made a
"respectable" showing in 1995, but declined to give details.

However, the sale - if it does happen - may not occur for months.
Lloyds' profits are so good - indeed, the bank is considering a share
buy-back - that it need not accede to the first bidder. If it does
sell, Lloyds can almost certainly afford to wait until an advantageous
price is offered.

NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS

PRIVATE BANKING is one of the most troublesome terms in the financial
services lexicon. Consider the number of definitions.

Ask a mainland European to define the term and, in all probability, a
private bank will be described as a banking institution not owned by
the government. Probe a little harder, especially in Switzerland, and
the respondent may qualify his answer by pointing out that a private
bank tends not to be incorporated, is structured on the partnership
model, and is totally reliant on the partners' resources for bank
capital.

Go to the UK or the US and a more familiar definition will be given.
Private banking is concerned with the provision of banking services for
high net worth individuals. However, as innumerable articles in PBI
have pointed out over the years, this definition is not without its
drawbacks.

The first problem is that no one has yet come up with a definitive
description of "high net worth". To judge from the plethora of "private
banks" coming into existence, the high net worth threshold is falling
by the day. It will surely not be long before the whole of the retail
banking sector will be subsumed by the private banking market.

A second problem is that most of the services provided by "private
banks" are not concerned with banking, i.e. the collection of deposits,
the making of loans and the provision of payment services. Asset
management, tax planning and the establishment and administration of
trusts, inter alia, are the essence of private banking, or more
accurately, of wealth management.

Although the possession of a banking licence can be advantageous in a
number of respects - it facilitates offshore and international "private
banking" as well as providing an aura of greater security - it is not
critical to the business of wealth management.

In fact "private banks" are probably responsible for only a small
proportion of the total stock of wealth owned by "high net worth"
individuals, although it is likely that they dominate the international
and offshore markets.

This poses a considerable dilemma for the editor of PBI. It may be
possible to identify a discrete target market in terms of wealth
management institutions that possess a banking licence. The problem is
that they constitute a small sector of the market within which private
banks compete.

Clearly a way around this impasse is to redefine "private banking".
Henceforth, as far as PBI is concerned, private banking will be defined
as "the provision of financial services and wealth management
facilities for affluent customers".

ONE CONSEQUENCE of this definition is that the scope and content of PBI
will be extended. From time to time previous editors have dabbled with
other institutions active in the wealth management sector such as legal
and accountancy firms, broker dealers and the plethora of institutions
contained within the "independent financial adviser" umbrella. Although
we do not intend to cut back our coverage of institutions active in the
international private banking sector - indeed we intend to expand both
the depth and breadth of our coverage - the "non-bank" private banks or
wealth management institutions will assume a higher profile.

This is at it should be. Last year a study produced by PSI of Tampa
Florida showed conclusively that US banks were losing market share in
the private banking sector to broker-dealers. The losses were not
confined to "middle-income affluent", a market segment which might be
considered particularly vulnerable. Perhaps, more worryingly, they
included the "elite private banking" segment, or clients who had on
average $1.2 million of investible assets and who contributed over
$10,000 in annual revenue.

The dynamism exhibited by non-bank sectors of the wealth management
sector makes it a natural for coverage in PBI. In the US, for example,
the investment companies and broker dealers are having a profound
effect on the evolution of the financial services sector. They have
often been a hothouse of new product developments, many of which can be
usefully taken up by "conventional" private banks.

BOOM IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

BY COINCIDENCE, according to statistics published by the Association of
Solicitor Investment Management (ASIM), it appears that the investment
management activities of UK legal firms are currently booming. Not only
did funds managed by its members double during 1995 but there has been
a substantial increase in the number of firms active in the sector.

It is no surprise to find that the firm with the biggest involvement is
an Edinburgh-based firm, Murray Beith & Murray, which has #180 million
($280 million) under management. Many of the firms currently active in
the Scottish fund management sector can trace their origins to the
legal and accountancy professions. This is especially the case with
Baille Gifford, Scotland's largest specialist fund manager. For the
record it still maintains a partnership structure.

There are two sets of factors responsible for the increased involvement
of solicitors in the wealth management sector. Like retail banks, they
have seen margins on their traditional business areas tumble as a
consequence of new entrants and increased competition. On the other
hand, they already had some of the core capabilities required for
successful involvement in the sector. They appear to be more than
willing to buy in what they lack.

BROKERS POST HIGHER EARNINGS THAN BANKS

IN THE last four years, brokerage houses serving individual investors
have posted consistently higher profits than investment banks,
according to research by the Security Industry Association (SIA) in New
York. The trend marks a sharp reversal from the 1980s, when investment
banks dominated Wall Street earnings by posting profits that were more
than twice those reported by "full-line" brokerage firms catering to
individual investors.

In 1994, which saw a global correction in the bond market, Wall
Street's investment banks were thrown for a loss, while the full-line
brokerages remained firmly in the black. And in 1995, a stockmarket
rally pushed the brokers' earnings some 60 percent over those of
investment banks (see chart).

"The securities industry has been turned upside down," said SIA
research chief Jeffrey Schaefer. In the 1990s, he explained, profits
grew due to three factors: the success of capital raising activities;
the booming business of money management both for institutions and
individuals; and the phenomenal growth of mutual funds. While the first
factor has helped investment banks, full-line brokerage houses have
taken advantage of all three factors, with retail investment services
giving them a strong edge.

"The biggest difference [from the 1980s] has been the role of mutual
funds, which I call the financial intermediary of the 1990s," Schaefer
explained."Long-term mutual funds, which only became attractive to
individuals in fixed-income markets in 1985, have allowed individuals
to participate in the equity and bond markets of the 1990s and still be
able to diversify."

The performance of full-line brokers in 1995 is particularly impressive
given the strong performance of investment banks, due to last year's
merger and acquisition boom and the surging revenues from the issuing
of securities. Investment banks have also benefited from 1995's bond
rally, which has greatly enhanced the value of their large bond
portfolios. Investment banks' fees from underwriting new stocks and
bonds have recently begun contributing from their bottom lines again.

In 1995, full-line brokerage firms have benefited far more from the
year's record stockmarket trading volume and price appreciation.
Excluding new stock issues, market activity has increased the value of
stocks by $2.1 trillion, or 33 percent, to a total of $8.4 trillion.
Last year was one of only three in the past 21 years when stock prices
increased more than 30 percent.

Brokers have also been better positioned to exploit the explosion of
stock mutual funds, which are far more profitable for retail brokerages
than bond funds. In 1995, an astonishing 87 percent of net cash flow
into long-term mutual funds went into equity instruments, according to
the SIA.

FORMER CHASE OFFICIAL NAMED TO HEAD AMEX BANK

IN EARLY January, American Express Bank appointed John Ward, a senior
executive at Chase Manhattan, as its new chairman and chief executive.

Ward served most recently as executive vice president at Chase and
chief executive of Chase Bankcard Services. His resignation from Chase
came two months before the scheduled closing of the bank's merger with
Chemical Banking, which will create the largest US commercial bank. In
the competition to fill the position of the new Chase's chief cards
executive, Ward was edged out by his opposite number at Chemical,
Charles Walsh.

A 27-year veteran at Chase Manhattan, Ward served in the 1970s as the
bank's credit and marketing officer for Japan and then Chase's chief of
trade and export finance in Europe and the Middle East.

In 1987, he was named credit policy officer of Chase's Individual Bank
based in New York, and became president of Chase Personal Financial
Services in 1991.

At Amex Bank, Ward will replace Steven Goldstein, who informed Amex
officials of his desire to resign when discussions concerning a
possible sale of Amex Bank were concluded in October.

American Express had tried to sell its international private bank, an
Edge Act institution chartered only for offshore operations, for $1
billion, or 1.25 times book value. The bank has performed poorly in
recent years, reporting a return on assets of 0.58 percent on assets of
$13.39 billion in 1994.

CREDIT SUISSE TARGETS TREPIDANT GERMANS

CREDIT SUISSE has extended its CS Direct Invest fund broking operations
to Germany, attempting to capture German private investors who are
worried about the implications of the European single currency and who
mistrust client confidentiality at German banks while at the same time
avoiding charges of aiding and abetting tax evasion.

Romeo Lacher, project manager at Credit Suisse in Zurich, said CS
Direct Invest is not competing on price, but will attempt to beat the
competition with superior customer advice, a 24-hour telephone service
and a twice-yearly personalised newsletter. He hopes to attract between
30,000 and 40,000 customers within four to five years.

This is the first time that German retail investors have been offered
Swiss investment products by direct marketing routes. The marketing
campaign has begun with large full-colour advertisements in the German
business press, and, from next month, will branch out into direct mail
aimed at high-income private investors - particularly those deemed to
have an interest in Switzerland as vacationers or owners of holiday
homes.

In most markets, an advertising campaign of this kind would be
unremarkable. But in Germany, Credit Suisse's advertisements are
reminiscent of the mood three years ago, when the German banks made
frenzied appeals to investors to avoid tax by transferring their
savings to accounts in Luxembourg. Some banks, particularly Dresdner
Bank, are still being "punished" for this, with regular police raids
and confiscation of confidential client records in branches suspected
of assisting tax evaders.

Lacher is resigned to criticism from competitor banks and the German
authorities. But he points out that the Credit Suisse advertisements
avoid the innuendo employed by some German banks during the Luxembourg
campaigns. Indeed, Lacher is playing so safe at present that the
current campaign does not even stress the advantages of the Swiss franc
as a reserve currency. However, the next set of ads may do, he said.

Moreover potential tax evaders will not be given any new opportunities
by CS Direct Invest. In fact, since the transfers will not be made in
person (often the case with Luxembourg accounts in 1993) investors have
less chance to evade tax.

Investments in the funds from German clients are transferred first to
Credit Suisse's Frankfurt offices, and then en masse to Switzerland.
Foreign money transfers of more than DM2,000 ($1,400) must be
registered with the local branch of the Bundesbank, and the names of
each investor must be supplied on request. "These transfers leave
footprints in Germany," Lacher said.

Customers have an incentive to use this automated route because Credit
Suisse waives the usual bank fees for foreign payment transfers.

Nevertheless, Lacher concedes that "the border region is a problem".
Germans living near Zurich, Basel or Schaffhausen prefer to drive into
Switzerland with cash in a briefcase and deposit it in a Swiss custody
account. By that means, they can escape the attention of the
Bundesbank, and, possibly, the German tax authorities too.

CS Direct Invest was launched in Switzerland last May and has attracted
25,000 enquiries. The bank declines to say how many have so far become
CS customers.

GRIEG MIDDLETON SUES DEFECTORS

GRIEG MIDDLETON, which claims to be the UK's largest private client
stockbroker, has issued writs claiming breach of contract by nine
ex-directors of Allied Provincial, another private client brokerage
company it acquired in 1995.

Following completion of the deal, 47 Allied Provincial staff located in
the company's Birmingham and Glasgow offices attempted to defect to
rival broker Brewin Dolphin (see PBI 88).

Grieg Middleton allowed 38 of the former Allied Provincial staff to
leave, but insisted that the nine most senior adhered strictly to the
terms of their contracts, which required the executives to serve a
six-month or 12-month notice period. Last month, however, the nine told
Grieg Middleton that they intended to start work at Brewin Dolphin.

ALBERT SHARP TAKEOVER FORMS POWERFUL NEW UK STOCKBROKER

ALBERT E SHARP, an independent stockbroker based in Birmingham, has
purchased the private client stockbroking business of Brown Shipley
from Guinness Peat Group for #7.4 million. This will create one of the
UK's largest independent firm of stockbrokers.

"The ambitions of both companies in the private client service market
are identical," said Trevor Cooke, Brown Shipley Stockbroking's chief
executive.

"Comprehensive investment services of the highest quality delivered
efficiently and with the greatest level of security are what private
clients need. Together Brown Shipley and Albert E Sharp will be able to
meet the challenges presented to our clients by an international
marketplace driven increasingly by high technology. The personal
service traditions inherent in both companies, which combine investment
skills and systems capabilities, will create a major new force in the
UK stockbroking industry."

Brown Shipley Stockbroking has 14 offices spread thoughout the UK. It
currently manages around #2 billion ($3 billion) of funds, mainly for
private investors, mostly on an advisory basis. It also has an
institutional presence in Scotland.

In 1994 the brokerage made pre-tax profits of #532,000. Profits are
expected to be down in 1995 as a result of falling stockmarket volumes.

Albert E Sharp has offices in Birmingham, Bristol, London and
Manchester. It manages #2 billion for private investors, pension funds
and charities, half of which is managed on a discretionary basis. It
also has around #115 million in its own family of proprietory unit
trusts (mutual funds).

Guinness Peat Group, which encapsulates a number of subsidiaries
involved in banking and asset management, describes itself as"a
strategic investment business". It is better known as the investment
vehicle of Sir Ron Brierley, a New Zealand entrepreneur.

Brown Shipley Stockbrokers has turned out to be a very good investment.
The company was acquired by Guinness Peat in 1993 for #5.6 million. It
then sold off Brown Shipley's unit trust and asset management
businesses for #2.7 million. The sale to Albert E Sharp of the
remaining businesses will result in near doubling of its investment.

QUILTER GOODISON TO MERGE WITH FOSTER & BRAITHWAITE

THE COMBINED effects of competition and new technology have resulted in
yet another merger in the UK private stockbroking sector. Quilter
Goodison, the private client stockbroker owned by Commercial Union
(CU), a leading UK composite insurer, is to merge with Foster &
Braithwaite, a stockbroking subsidiary of Credit Commercial de France
(CCF).

The combined company will be called Quilter & Co. CU will own around 75
percent of Quilter's shares, and CCF the remainder. John Vincent, who
is currently Foster & Braithwaite's managing director, will head the
new business.

The merger reflects recent changes within the UK stockbroking and
investment management sector. With the arrival of the Crest settlement
system later this year, the UK stockbroking sector is likely to
experience further segmentation.

The execution of stockmarket trades is likely to become a commodity
business usurped by discount brokers and banks.

RBC PROVES POPULAR CHOICE WITH EXECUTIVES

EXECUTIVE PLUS, a private banking product offered by Royal Bank of
Canada, has proved to be a popular choice for globetrotting business
executives. Offering an instant access deposit account with tiered
interest rates, the product offered by RBC's Jersey-based Global
Private Banking Unit (GPB) has attracted new deposits in excess of #10
million ($6.5 million) since it was relaunched in August of last year.

Executive Plus, which commenced four years ago, embodies a number of
enhancements. "A number of improvements were made," says Chris Blampied
of RBC (Jersey). "American Express and Visa Gold Cards are now
available to account holders. We also expanded our range of currencies
to include the Canadian dollar, American dollar and sterling." Designed
for the global and wealthy executive, a wide range of banking services
is available to clients maintaining a minimum balance of #10,000 in
funds. The improved product was relaunched in August of this year.

"Executive Plus is targeted at high valued clients with income and
assets above the retail thresholds," explained GPBs Chris Blampied.
"The client base is very international, ranging from the Middle East
and the US, as well as from the UK. We attract many existing clients.
Since the re-launch we have experienced an awful lot of growth from
within the network. We have seen a number of French clients going into
the product. However, we cannot discern a definite trend.

"We have in excess of $21 million in Executive Plus, with an average
balance of #70,000 per customer. Due to our success we have recently
opened an office in the Isle of Man and are planning another in
Guernsey."

Royal Bank of Canada, is one of North America's largest banks, with
C$405 billion ($300 billion) in assets under administration. Royal Bank
of Canada Global Private Banking, a Jersey-based operation, offers
private banking and investment services to customers in more than 130
countries. GPB currently has C$29 billion in assets under
administration.

Looking ahead into 1996, Blampied is buoyant."Between Jersey and the
Isle of Man, the two offices providing Executive Plus, our objective is
to obtain #50 million in deposits by the end of the year."

MONTANA EVALUATES SECRET BANKING FACILITY

A SANTA BARBARA entrepreneur has proposed the establishment of a
Swiss-style secret banking unit in the state of Montana. The proposal,
which has attracted the anxious attentions of federal banking and tax
authorities, is now being actively studied by Montana regulators.

While the proposal appears far-fetched at first sight, Montana
authorities said it could lead to the establishment of an innovative
offshore deposit facility in the mountain state.

In late 1995, Robert Svoboda, a former banker and Montana resident now
living in Santa Barbara, asked Montana regulators to commission a
feasibility study to investigate the possibility of establishing a
Swiss-style secret banking facility in the state. Such a bank would be
state-chartered, and would not benefit from federal deposit insurance
and the federal regulation that goes along with it.

The unit would provide highly confidential deposit services to
foreigners through the use of numbered accounts. Svoboda's most
aggressive scenario would allow non-resident aliens to deposit funds in
a Montana bank, which could then put the funds in trusts that could
deposit the money in non-taxable investments or transfer them to other
banks and countries. Depending on clients' investment and deposit
needs, the bank could provide varying "levels of privacy."

"This isn't for money-laundering or helping people to keep from paying
taxes," Svoboda told American Banker in December. "It's a safe haven
for money, and it's private."

According to state authorities, Svoboda described his initial
motivation as "philanthropic" - secret banking facilities could provide
his former home state with significant revenue in state-levied fees on
assets and possibly escheatment revenues, where funds in secret
accounts might revert to the state treasury if they are not claimed by
heirs of deceased depositors.

Such an institution might also benefit from Montana's relatively
unregulated financial environment and the Montana state constitution's
unusual privacy provisions.

Responding to Svoboda's proposal, Montana's legislature formed an
interim committee late last year to study the idea. The committee has
met four times and will meet next in late January, when it will hear
presentations from federal authorities, including representatives of
the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of the Treasury and the
Federal Reserve Bank.

"No precedent exists for this anywhere in the country," said Chris
Olson, Montana's deputy banking commissioner, who freely admits that
state banking authorities currently lack the legal and regulatory
background to evaluate such a novel plan. Outside the state, banking
experts have greeted the Svoboda proposal with incredulity or derisive
laughter.

"The people who haven't laughed are the Feds," said Steven Maly, a
legislative aide who is co-ordinating the state legislature's interim
research effort. "Knowing that we do a lot of fishing up here, the Feds
have warned us that we would be bottom-fishing attracting the worst
criminal element - with this sort of activity."

Maly said he was surprised by the level of concern expressed by federal
authorities. "Without saying as much, they seemed to be telling us,
`This could happen, and we're not going to help you do it.'"

Disregarding the wrath of the Feds, Maly believes a Montana secret
banking facility is simply not practical, given existing US law and
regulation. For example, he sees no way to circumvent the federal
requirement that all deposits in excess of $10,000 must be reported to
the US Treasury Department.

But Maly is evaluating the possibility of minimizing federal
supervision of a state-chartered depository for offshore funds which
have no tax liability and which waive the requirements for federal
deposit insurance.

A state-chartered foreign funds depository might provide offshore
clients a higher degree of privacy than other US banks, and it might
provide some non-taxable investment services as well. In particular, a
significant level of federal oversight could be avoided where funds are
deposited but not transferred out of the depository.

"We're thinking about something that is much simpler and more primitive
than a secret banking facility," Maly explained."We're not planning to
compete with existing offshore facilities. Instead, we're looking at
creating a new and different way of attracting legitimate flight
capital. One angle we're looking at is tying deposits to precious
metals, especially platinum, which is produced in Montana."

The cost advantages of in-state production and storage of precious
metals, coupled with new financial technology and reduced regulation,
could create a commercial opportunity to establish a new kind of
offshore depository in Montana, Maly said.

He believes that such a facility might be attractive to rich families
in Taiwan, for example, who are looking for secure and relatively
secret international deposit facilities, and who already hold a
significant amount of their wealth in precious metals.

BARRIERS TO INTERSTATE BANKING REMOVED

IN LATE December, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
issued an interpretive letter designed to lower the barriers to
interstate trust banking. The OCC's letter comes more than a year after
Congress passed the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act, which ushered in a new era for national banking in the
US.

The OCC's action aims to "level the playing field" for US banks wishing
to extend their trust business to states where they have no trust
charters. According to the OCC, trust banks can now ignore state laws
requiring them to have operations based in those states. Moreover,
national banks need not apply for special permits if state-chartered
banks are exempt from them.

Banks have long complained that state regulatory requirements, which
generally stipulate that trust departments must have in-state
headquarters to obtain special exemptions, have contributed to
inefficiency by preventing consolidations. However, the OCC's ruling is
likely to face resistance from state regulators uncomfortable with
further intrusions from federal banking authorities.

The OCC's letter came in response to an inquiry from Midwest
super-regional Banc One, which is eager to centralise its 11-state
trust business under a single national banking charter.

US TRUST UNITS FACE NEW FEDERAL REGULATION

FEDERAL REGULATORS have completed a new rule which will require trust
departments of large US institutions to disclose new profitability
information for 1997.

According to the new regulation, trust departments must report salaries
and employee benefits, as well as other direct expenses such as the
cost of equipment. Trust departments must also report instances where
surcharges or the cost of settling customer disputes have caused an
account to lose more than $100,000.

Up until now, trust departments have reported only the size of
discretionary and non-discretionary assets by account type. The new
rule applies to 2,819 trust departments that manage more than $100
million in assets. These units control 99 percent of the over $11
trillion held in trust at US financial institutions.

The new regulation was drafted by the Federal Financial Institutions
Examinations Council, an inter-agency group of federal regulators that
supervises federally insured depository institutions.

The rule will permit examiners to produce uniform measurements of the
performance and risk management policies of trust departments, and to
get a fuller picture of their solvency and profitability.

Regulators have called for new scrutiny of the US trust industry, as
the gathering and managing of trust assets has gained momentum in
recent years. In the five years ending in 1993, US trust assets grew 61
percent to $10.6 trillion.

The American Bankers Association in Washington has protested against
the new regulation as a violation of confidentiality. Bankers are
concerned that the information may be used to gauge the profitability
of competitors, and that such information may become public as the
result of litigation, as happened recently in a suit filed against the
derivatives activity of Bankers Trust.

Regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank have responded that the
profitability information it collects on trust departments will remain
confidential, although the central bank will release composite
profitability data which will be of use to the industry.

Bankers have responded that little benefit will come from such data, as
profitability benchmarking services are already offered by private
consultants. The Financial Services Association of Niles, Michigan, for
example, currently sells a service called Trust Compare, which allows
trust departments to benchmark their profitability against that of
other institutions using the service.

SPAIN:  SPANISH BANK ENDS ALLIANCE

THE JOINT private banking venture launched last year by Banco Popular
and Bankers Trust (see PBI 76) has proved short-lived. Banco Popular
recently ended the collaboration agreement on the grounds that there
was too much competition between the two institutions.

"After six months in operation we came to the conclusion that for a
bank such as ours, well positioned in the domestic market and with a
substantial branch network there were few advantages to be gained from
such an agreement. We realised that basically all we were doing was
presenting our clients to Bankers Trust. As a result, we decided to end
the agreement," Fernando de Soto of Banco Popular told PBI.

Last year Banco Popular chose to develop its private banking services
in close collaboration with Bankers Trust, as a means of giving an
international dimension to its existing service and product offer. Each
bank opened its own specialised private banking branch in Madrid.

Bankers Trust was to be responsible for managing client assets but each
bank had separate relationship managers and was responsible for
marketing its services. For Bankers Trust, whose presence in Spain has
been mainly geared towards foreign customers, the agreement with Banco
Popular was seen as a means of drawing closer to the domestic market.

Banco Popular is adamant that competition was the only motive for
ending the relationship, but with its reputation for tight risk control
and prudent investment practices, Banco Popular can hardly have been
pleased by Bankers Trust's loss of prestige.

The US bank's reputation has taken a severe battering over the last 18
months as a consequence of its derivative-related activities and the
lawsuits brought against it by disgruntled clients such as Proctor &
Gamble.

In the meantime, Banco Popular will continue to deal with its high net
worth clients through the branch network."This system worked very well
in the past and there is no reason why it shouldn't continue to do so,"
said de Soto.

RBOS JERSEY TARGETS EXPATRIATES

EXPATRIATES ARE the main beneficiaries of the worlds first offshore
telephone banking service. Launched by Jersey-based Royal Bank of
Scotland International, the new service, is accessible on a 24-hour
basis, offering clients full banking facilities with comprehensive
security measures and the highest degree of confidentiality.

The banks Premium Account will be available to customers who deposit a
minimum of #2,000. It can be opened in a variety of currencies.
Customers can transfer money between different RBSI accounts, set up or
make changes to standing orders or direct debits, pay bills and deal in
currencies and shares. "It makes sense for customers living overseas,
in whatever time zone, to be able to make personal contact with their
bank whenever it is convenient for them", says Peter Sherriffs director
of the Offshore Banking Division.

So far, the new service has attracted considerable interest, especially
from expatriates in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the bank reports. Further
interest has come from as far afield as Australia, Singapore and Hong
Kong, from expatriates and overseas nationals, as well as residents
with second homes outside the UK. Among European clients, Scandinavians
showed a particular interest in the new service.

FINDING THE MOST FAVOURABLE TAX REGIME

A study published by the Adam Smith Institute, a UK-based think-tank
shows a surprisingly wide disparity in tax burdens between members of
the OECD. Ian Orton reports

JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US are the best countries for tax-averse
individuals to be domiciled. According to Tax Freedom Day 1996, a
report which attempts to compute the number of days an individual has
to "work" for the government, these three countries demand far less
from their citizens than other OECD members, especially constituents of
the European Union.

In 1994 a Japanese worker had, on average to work only 119 days - or
until April 29 to pay off his or her tax bill (see chart). Australian
workers had to work a day longer. It took US workers another six days
to work off their annual tax load.

Onerous as these requirements were, however, they were much lower than
those faced by Europeans, especially members of the European Union. Tax
Freedom Day would have arrived in the European Union on June 14, or
after 165 days, compared with June 7 or 158 days for the OECD.

Some European countries fared relatively well. In Portugal a worker
would "only" have had to work for 132 days or until May 11 to meet his
or her tax obligations. In the UK the equivalent date was May 17 or 138
days.

Conversely, however, Scandinavian workers would have had to work well
into the second half of the year to clear their tax obligations.
Norwegians and Finns would have had to work for 185 days, Danes 200 and
Swedes 208 - or until July 27 - to achieve tax freedom.

As always, with any international comparison, there are considerable
methodological problems and, as a consequence, the tax freedom days
calculated for each country are not necessarily a"true" reflection of
the time needed to work-off the annual tax obligation.

To some extent they reflect the methodology used by Gabriel Stein, the
report's author. As such, the figures give only a rough approximation
of where Tax Freedom Day might occur in each country.

For each country shown in the chart, total tax revenue as a percentage
of GDP at market prices has been compared to the equivalent UK figures.
The difference between the two figures has then been translated into
days of the year, and this has then been added to - or subtracted from
- the British Tax Freedom Day.

In 1996, the average UK employee will have to work 142 days, that is
until Tuesday May 21 to pay off his or her tax bill, the same number of
days as last year. The 2p reduction in the standard rate of income tax
announced in the November budget has been offset by increases in other
areas, such as excise duties on tobacco and petrol.

Nonetheless, the situation is still an improvement on the 1970s and
early-1980s when the tax burden was much higher. The 1980s and early-
1990s saw a continuous fall in the tax burden with Tax Freedom Day
moving earlier and earlier from June 6 in 1982 to May 17 in 1993. It
then shot back five days in 1995 and shows little sign of reverting to
the 1980s trend.

The situation would be even worse if government borrowing was taken
into account, however. Stein argues that this should be added to the
total burden of taxation, since it eventually has to be paid for by
future taxpayers. This would mean that the UK taxpayer would not be
free of both burdens until Monday June 3. Nonetheless, as a result of a
fall in government borrowing, this would be an improvement on the
situation in 1993 when the relevant day was June 13.

For much of the European Union, where many countries have much heavier
debt burdens than the UK, the situation would have been even worse.

As tax burdens rise, as governments attempt to conform with the
Maastricht criteria before 1999, this should mean that there should be
substantial opportunities for private bankers, especially those which
place emphasis on tax-planning.

LOOKING AHEAD TO A PROMISING FUTURE

Following a turbulent period of restructuring in the 1970s, Trinkaus &
Burkhardt's management is confident, that their integration into the
HSBC Group will ensure a rosy future. Ulrich Sutter talked to Dr
Sieghardt Rometsch

THE PAST year produced outstanding results for Trinkaus & Burkhardt,
one of Germany's oldest private banks. Net profits increased by 24.9
percent to DM92.9 million ($64 million), an all-time high.

Interest income leaped to DM177.7 million, an increase of 23,7 percent
on the previous year, while commission income was marginally down by
3.4 percent at DM160.6 million. Since flotation in 1985, Trinkaus has
seen its total asset base jump by more than 260 percent.

Operating from their Dusseldorf headquarters overlooking the
prestigious Konigsallee, Trinkaus has experienced its fair share of ups
and downs especially during the 1970s and early 1980s, admits Dr
Sieghardt Rometsch, a partner responsible for corporate banking.

"The bank was caught up in the aftermath of the Herstatt banking
collapse. Despite performing well, we were forced to look for outside
help to rebuild our capital base, and this resulted in Citibank
acquiring a controlling stake. This produced a change of strategy and
we abandoned retail banking," said Rometsch.

"The Citibank connection was relatively short-lived, and in 1980 the
bank was acquired by Midland Bank. Our fortunes changed rapidly,
largely as a result of Midland Bank's decision to give us a large
degree of autonomy. It surely was paramount to the success we have
achieved so far", he said with pride. "Reducing Midland's shareholding
from 90 percent to 70 percent subsequently helped strengthen our
position with our customers as an independent private bank."

A former general manager with Chase Manhattan Bank, Rometsch argues
that most foreign banks have failed to be profitable in the German
market, as a consequence of adopting relatively short-term strategies.

"The exception, of course, is Citibank which has successfully
established itself in the retail banking sector. The vast majority of
banks, however, do not understand that private banking is predicated on
relationships and has to grow organically. It will sometimes take years
for a relationship to create the trust necessary to sustain profitable
business. Once we have crossed this line, they accept us as partners.
Only then will the typical private banking client entrust larger sums
to us."

Rometsch is also critical of many foreign banks management systems.
"These often reduce the individual's creativity and his overall
performance. Matrix management is still very common especially with US
banks. From my own experience, I have found this style a handicap to
the successful private banker."

Since Trinkaus & Burkhardt abandoned retail banking to concentrate on
asset management, securities and corporate banking, its performance has
improved significantly. The bank now has some DM35 billion of assets
under management of which DM18 billion comes from private banking
clients.

Contrary to the industry trend, which has resulted in a reduction of
minimum thresholds, private banking clients must have at least DM1
billion in free assets of which they must place DM250,000 with
Trinkaus.

"As soon as profit margins were being squeezed, we decided to set
rigorous benchmarks, to avoid getting involved in price competition. We
analysed our markets and came to the conclusion that we had a franchise
in the regional Mittelstand market, especially in companies with a
minimum turnover of between DM100 million-DM200 million. I think you
need a certain minimum size to be able to stay in the business and to
deliver good performance."

"A typical account manager at Trinkaus will look after between 40-60
clients. Training has been made a priority since the mid-1980s. Our
staff spend an annual average of 60-90 hours on in-house training.

"As a small private bank we are fully aware that we must be available
for our clients from 9 am to 5 pm. So our approach is somewhat
different from other institutions. We just don't think it is
justifiable to send them on seminars in training centres. After all,
our clients should expect excellent performance and this means that we
should be working all the time".

International expansion has so far been on a modest scale. Besides five
domestic offices, representative offices were set up in Luxembourg and
Zurich in the late-1970s. Overall, business expansion has largely
concentrated on the affluent region of North Rhine Westphalia.

"The Mittelstand is our main business focus", explains Rometsch.
"Although they have always been very export-oriented, they simply have
not achieved much penetration in Far Eastern markets, although we hope
this may change.

"The Hong Kong of German industry is eastern Europe. They are more
comfortable with the distance and culture and a majority speak the
German language. Today our natural market also includes Luxembourg and
parts of the Netherlands, where we are experiencing good results. When
HSBC decided to close their Luxembourg banking activities it was only
natural for Trinkaus to look after their clients. Through this
connection we maintain an Asian client base".

The integration process within the HSBC Group has been smooth. "Our
link with HSBC is a strong selling argument", he claims. "We have
introduced a substantial number of clients to HSBC. Nevertheless, we
have to be aware, that operating as a private bank within a group
network requires enormous sensitivity on our part. It is almost like a
walk on a razor blade - as independent private bank operating within
the network of one of the world's largest banks."

European expansion plans, however, are far off the agenda at Trinkaus.
"We have no plans to become a global player in the private banking
market. We are a truly German private bank with strong roots in the
Mittelstand. This is our strength on which we have built our expertise
over centuries".

Rometsch concluded: "If clients within the HSBC Group need advice on DM
products, they certainly find them at Trinkaus & Burkhardt."

BACK TO THE FUTURE?

Midland Bank, a UK subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC), established a domestic private bank in 1993 which
eschewed much of the conventional wisdom associated with the sector.
Ian Orton spoke to Peter Renn, its first managing director, about the
philosophy behind the initiative and the progress achieved to date

OF ALL the new domestic private banks established by the large UK
financial institutions during the 1990s Midland Private Banking has
undoubtedly attracted the most interest, not least because of its
decision to use staff drawn from the commercial bank.

Purists could argue that Midland's initiative is yet another instance
of the private banking moniker being devalued. For Peter Renn, however,
the establishment of Midland's private bank, is a natural consequence
of the changes affecting the UK banking sector generally.

"The UK retail banking sector has experienced rapid change over the
last ten years. This is particularly the case as far as service
provision has been concerned. New technology is making it easier to
service retail customers through remote media. There are far fewer
branches. However, there is still a demand for personal service,
especially from the more affluent segment of the customer base. Hence
the decision to establish the domestic private bank."

According to Renn, in some respects the establishment of domestic
private banks by the large UK banks is a throwback to an earlier era.
The UK banks only became mass market institutions during the 1960s.
Before then their customer base had an element of exclusivity. In this
environment it was possible to provide a relatively high level of
personal service, albeit in a much more narrowly defined market.

Thirty years on, the new private banks are attempting to re-establish
an aura of exclusivity and personal service - and generate high quality
fee and commission income as a consequence.

"It is also a natural consequence to an increasingly competitive
environment. Product differentiation and market segmentation are
logical responses to increased competition," said Renn.

The HSBC UK strategy

The domestic private bank was an outcome of a global review of its
interests in this sector conducted by HSBC following its acquisition of
Midland in 1992.

At that time, Midland had two operations which catered for the
financial services requirements of the affluent. Samuel Montagu catered
for very high net worth individuals. Midland Personal Asset Management
catered for the needs of private clients with more modest means.

The review resulted in the pooling together of the group's
international private banking operations under the umbrella of HSBC.
Each of the component banks would retain or operate with its own name
in order to capitalise on existing reputations and ensure that staff
and relationships were country-focused rather than legal
entity-focused.

This meant that in the UK Samuel Montagu and the British Bank of the
Middle East would continue to cater for the financial elite from a
joint office in Hill Street, London. It was also decided to establish a
domestic private bank based on Midland Personal Asset Management.

"It was a natural outcome. The Personal Asset Management business had a
number of private banking elements such as a brokerage, fund management
and trusts. What it didn't have were the human resources or the brand
recognition to communicate a quality service image. The establishment
of a private bank provided an opportunity for these attributes to be
provided," said Renn.

The importance of personal service

The provision of a high level of service was perceived from the outset
as the key to enabling Midland to differentiate itself from other
institutions.

"There is no shortage of definitions of private banking or, for that
matter, private banks. I think the term private banking should really
be used to describe the market rather than the nature of the products
or services provided. Private banks can trace their origin to a number
of sources - legal and accounting firms, fund managers, stockbrokers,
even commercial banks.

"Although each institution will attempt to follow a different strategy
there is often one basic similarity between them - they will tend to
emphasise one particular product. This will often reflect their
origins. Private banks which evolved out of legal or accounting
partnerships will emphasise their trust and tax planning capabilities,
asset management specialists their fund management skills and so on. In
other words, the nature of the service will be product-orientated.

"At Midland we had to decide whether to go down a similar route and, if
so, what type of products we should offer. After conducting a lot of
research we decided to go down a different route by making the
provision of high quality service the keystone of our strategy".

Customer preferences

Midland's research suggested that prospective clients were looking for
advice and an ongoing relationship from a private bank. "There is a
definite gap in the market as far as the provision of advice is
concerned. Although people are becoming more affluent there is no
shortage of financial worries. There is less certainty of unbroken
unemployment. People are living longer. Meanwhile, the government is
reducing health and welfare provision. No matter how affluent they may
be now, people are being forced to address long-term financial planning
issues and they need advice."

The research also showed that potential clients were not particularly
interested in being sold a plethora of banking or investment products.
Nonetheless, they were appreciative of a broad range of product
offerings drawn from a variety of suppliers.

They were also looking for specific - or rather seamless solutions to
their financial problems. It was clear from the outset that "packaged"
solutions would not generate much enthusiasm.

The emphasis placed on advice and the preference for a "bespoke"
private banking service was critical in a number of respects. Despite
the fact that an organisation the size of HSBC is in a position to
provide from its own resources all of the products and services
traditionally associated with private banking, it was felt that the
private bank should function as an independent intermediary. It would
therefore have the freedom to buy in - on the client's behalf - any
relevant product or service.

Second, given the nature of the "product" offered, considerable
emphasis was placed on the ability of relationship managers to provide
service of a quality that would satisfy prospective clients.
Relationship managers in this environment have to encapsulate a number
of skills and functions and must develop an almost encyclopedic
knowledge of the banking and financial services sector. They also have
to be readily accessible.

Staffing the private bank

Midland decided to staff the bank with people drawn from the commercial
bank supplemented, where necessary, by outside recruits. These were
often drawn from the IFA sector. Although this decision has been
greeted with some surprise by outside commentators - not to mention
competitors - Renn is unrepentant about the efficacy of the approach.

"The first point to make is that in the current UK regulatory
environment it is virtually impossible for unqualified personnel to be
let loose in the private banking market. All of our people were
rigorously trained and are in receipt of one of the qualifications
recognised by the Personal Investment Authority.

"We also used very stringent selection criteria to identify potential
relationship managers. We understood quite clearly that wealthy
customers will only deal with experienced people with the authority to
take decisions and act on them."

The commercial bank was in a position to meet this requirement. "A bit
of grey hair does you no harm in this particular environment. At
Midland, we had quite a large pool of very experienced bankers to draw
on. Many of the bank's more senior personnel could look back on 20 or
25 years of banking experience. We were very keen to encourage these
people to come and work for us."

It was also decided from the outset to provide the bank with a local
focus. "We thought it was of critical importance to ensure that our
people were locally based - not located in a remote City office. You
can't develop significant relationships if the customer has to travel
to London every time he, or she, wants to see a private banker."

There are over 30 Midland Private Banking branches located throughout
England and Wales. They share a common location with the commercial
bank branches.

Tied versus IFA status

Midland's strategy meant that the new private bank's "natural"
competitors would be the IFA sector. "These are the institutions which
most closely match what Midland are trying to do.

"The decision to go down the IFA route or to concentrate on selling
Midland or HSBC products was a tough one to make. We rejected the tied
option. We knew that customers might feel compromised by being offered
only Midland or HSBC-branded products. Their options are limited.

"We also decided to stay clear of packaged products and services.
First, a package will not necessarily address the specific customer
requirements. Second, customers may feel that they are having to pay
for something they do not really need. A `bespoke' approach is much
more efficacious. It is cost effective - customers only pay for what
they need - and it is much more flexible. It doesn't cost much more to
select and manage a customised portfolio of stocks and shares than unit
trusts, for example."

Pricing was something that Midland Private Banking was conscious of
from the outset. "Although the customer base was comfortably off, we
were conscious of the fact that, in many instances their money had been
hard earned. They did not expect to be ripped off."

Positional advantages

Renn maintains that the bank had two important positional advantages
over the IFA sector, however. The first was that it had a
well-recognised brand name. The second was that it could rely on the
commercial bank for potential customers.

"On the whole, IFAs do a very good job in the financial planning and
wealth management market. Nonetheless clients are sometimes put off by
a relative lack of security. There have been a number of
well-publicised cases involving IFAs where probity - and the security
of the client's assets - has been severely compromised.

"Clients do run a notional risk assessment of institutions. One of the
perceived strengths of the Midland Bank name is that we are a large,
safe and well-run institution. Size is important in this market as, I
think, the aftermath of the Barings crash showed."

The bulk of the private bank's customers have been generated by
internal referrals. The customer threshold is income or free assets of
#100,000, although this is more a guideline figure rather than a strict
eligibility criterion. "Midland Private Banking targets the
`comfortably off' portion of the market rather than the very affluent".

Renn admits that a customer recruitment strategy which relied very
heavily on referrals from the commercial bank could have been
problematic. This is especially the case in the new sales culture which
is permeating retail banks. A customer lost to the private bank may
mean the loss of potential sales revenue for the retail bank.

"There is always scope for a potential conflict of interest unless you
make sure you have the right organisational structure in place. We were
helped by the fact that local private bank branches were structured as
part of the General Manager's department. As such, a referral amounted
to an internal transfer within a single arena, not a transfer from one
department to another. We were also fortunate in that when the bank was
being set up, the Midland branch network was in the process of
upheaval. Very senior bankers were being put back into the branches and
this probably eased the transition."

In practice, the strategy has worked well with the commercial bank
generating a substantial proportion of Midland Private Banking's
customer base. "In most cases, we have had an almost seamless transfer
of an old relationship". During the first half of 1995, for example,
the retail branch network generated 3,500 customers.

The future

Renn maintains that the future for the UK private banking sector is
very good. The market is opening up and many of the old cliches are no
longer relevant. There is a lot of "new money" about. Senior company
executives, entrepreneurs, media people, athletes - even lottery
winners are domestic private banks' natural constituency. Midland
Private Bankers is well placed to take advantage.
