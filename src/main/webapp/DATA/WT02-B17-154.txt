<h3>ENERGY SECRETARY, INDUSTRY LEADERS MARK MILESTONE
IN PRODUCTION OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION FUEL</h3>


Golden, Colo., April 19, 1996  --  Energy Secretary Hazel R. O Leary today joined industry leaders to launch a feasibility study on commercializing the technology for converting corn fiber into a clean transportation fuel.  This project represents the Clinton administration's commitment to reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil, improving air quality, and stimulating economic development. <P>

	O Leary joined representatives of Amoco Corp., Stone and Webster Engineering Corp. and SWAN Biomass Company in a ceremony at the U.S. Department of Energy s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  The dignitaries marked the successful operation of NREL s pilot plant using a process developed by Amoco to turn corn fiber into ethanol.  Corn fiber, a byproduct of corn ethanol refining, is one of several feedstocks expected to make biomass ethanol commercially viable.  The research at NREL has assisted Amoco and Stone and Webster to make significant progress toward the commercialization of corn fiber as an ethanol feedstock.<P>

	O Leary noted the environmental and economic benefits of biomass ethanol and said it was appropriate that today s ceremony be held close to Earth Day. <P>



	  Ethanol from biomass can bring a major boost to the ethanol and agriculture industries and create thousands of new jobs,   O Leary said.   In addition to decreasing our dependence on imported oil, biomass ethanol is a clean-burning transportation fuel that will help clear the air in our cities and mean better health for our nation s citizens.  The Department of Energy is proud to be working in partnership with industry leaders such as Amoco and Stone and Webster to speed its development.<P>
   
	Under a cooperative research and development agreement, Amoco is using NREL s pilot plant to study the feasibility of using corn fiber in the production of biomass ethanol.  Today s ceremony marked the plant s successful  conversion of corn fiber into ethanol, but other feedstocks, including fast-growing trees and switchgrass, also hold promise as commercially viable feedstocks.<P>

	Amoco and Stone and Webster formed SWAN Biomass Company late last year to commercialize Amoco s process for low-cost conversion of biomass to ethanol for fuel and industrial use.
