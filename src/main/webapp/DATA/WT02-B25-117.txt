<p><i>Please use these talking points as a guide in presenting
science and treatment information about brain disorders to your
local media. This information can also help you develop your own
speech on brain disorders. You should vary your presentation to
suit the level of knowledge and perspective of your audience.</i></p>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of adults in the
    U.S., or five million Americans, suffer from a severe form of
    one of the following brain disorders: schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
    disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness),
    and major depression.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It&#146;s no secret that brain disorders are shrouded in
    stigma and discrimination. For centuries they have been
    misunderstood, feared, hidden, and often ignored.</p>
    <p>In the last decade, significant scientific advances have
    provided the first real hope for people with brain disorders.
    Pioneering research has found both a biological basis for brain
    disorders and treatments that work.</p>
    <p>However, 40 percent of people with brain disorders do not
    seek treatment. These individuals are suffering needlessly.<sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Severe Mental Illnesses are Brain Disorders</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Despite age-old myths and misinformation, severe
    &quot;mental illnesses&quot; are not caused by bad character,
    poor child-rearing, or an individual&#146;s behavior. A
    severe mental illness is a brain disorder. And brain
    disorders -- like Parkinson&#146;s disease, Alzheimer&#146;s
    disease, and epilepsy -- are biologically based physical
    disorders. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Brain chemistry, structure, and functioning, as well as
    genes, have been identified as among the leading biological
    factors causing brain disorders.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Scientists have identified the brain chemicals serotonin,
    dopamine, and norepinephrine and their receptors, which
    determine much of our mental and physical activities. Imbalances
    in these chemicals have been linked to brain disorders such
    as schizophrenia and depression.</p>
    <p>The brains of people with brain disorders are structurally
    different from the brains of healthy individuals. Through
    advanced imaging technology and other methods, scientists have
    been able to take &quot;pictures&quot; that show structural
    differences in the brains of individuals with brain
    disorders. Scientists have also detected different
    functioning in regions of the cortex and other areas of the
    brain in individuals with brain disorders.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Further, recent studies indicate genetic links for brain
    disorders. For example, an average child has a one percent
    chance of experiencing schizophrenia in his or her lifetime. However,
    the child of one parent with schizophrenia faces a 10 percent
    chance, while the child of two parents with schizophrenia
    faces a 50 percent chance. Scientists are currently working
    to pinpoint the specific genes linked to brain disorders.</p>
    <p>It is important for all Americans to understand that brain
    disorders have physiological indicators and that they can be
    diagnosed and treated as precisely as many other medical conditions.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Treatment Works</b>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Like other medical problems, there are many treatments --
    including various types of medications and other therapies --
    that are available to help people with brain disorders live
    healthy, productive lives. In fact, success rates for
    treatment of brain disorders are impressive.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the
    success rates for treating severe forms of specific brain
    disorders with medications and other therapies are: 60
    percent for treating acute symptoms of schizophrenia; 70 to
    90 percent for treating panic disorder; 75 percent for
    treating OCD; 80 to 90 percent for treating bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
    illness); and 70 to 80 percent for treating major
    depression.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These success rates are far better than those of other
    medical conditions. For example, heart disease has just a 45
    to 50 percent treatment success rate.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition, the new generation of medications recently
    approved and under development can better target problem
    areas in the brain. This increased precision relieves
    symptoms more effectively and reduces the unintended side
    effects associated with many existing treatments.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Costs are Comparable</b>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The cost of treating a brain disorder is comparable to the
    cost of treating many other medical illnesses.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For example, the total direct cost in 1990 for treating a
    person with severe diabetes was $7,725, compared with $7,158
    for treating a person with schizophrenia.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In Texas, a state where parity health insurance exists for
    state employees, the total cost of treating state employees
    and their family members for brain disorders was one-fifth
    the cost of treating cardiovascular disease in 1994.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 1994, one managed care company in Texas had 12,233
    claimants for cardiovascular disease and 4,617 claimants for
    schizophrenia. The average cost for treating people with cardiovascular
    disease was $2,496, compared to $1,424 for treating people
    with schizophrenia.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>People Treated for Brain Disorders Can Lead Healthy,
Productive Lives</b>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of adults in the
    U.S., or five million Americans, suffer from a brain
    disorder. Approximately 40 percent of these individuals do
    not seek treatment, despite the fact that effective
    medications and other therapies are available.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Treatment can help individuals lead healthy, productive
    lives. Countless success stories prove it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><i>[If appropriate, insert your own success stories
    here to localize your speech.]</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Consider Daphne, a 30 year-old woman who had schizophrenia
    for ten years and even attempted suicide. After two years of
    treatment with clozapine, one of the new breakthrough
    medications, she is now teaching public school part-time and
    living independently.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Or talk to Alex, 20, who has obsessive-compulsive
    disorder. His illness caused him to obsess about the idea
    that the CIA was following him. Treatment helped him control
    his thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Philip, a 65 year-old well-known actor, will tell you how
    much his life has improved since he began taking medication
    for panic disorder. Almost immediately after beginning the
    medication, he recovered from the severe panic attacks that
    used to leave him parked alongside the highway, sweating and
    unable to drive.</p>
