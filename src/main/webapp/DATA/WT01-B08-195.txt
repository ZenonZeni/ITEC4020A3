Promoting the conversion of defense enterprises in the Newly Independent States (NIS) to civil production is a high-priority objective in the Administration's foreign and international economic policies.  The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) plays a central role in interagency initiatives to achieve that objective.  Foreign defense conversion is also important to expand U.S. trade and exports.  It also helps to facilitate the reduction of the NIS defense industrial base, stem the smuggling of nuclear items and other sensitive items, combat pressures for arms sales or other proliferation, and support market reform and privatization. <P> 

BXA has been the outreach arm to U.S. business and a source of commercial expertise for U.S. defense conversion assistance efforts.  BXA assists and promotes U.S. private investment in NIS defense conversion projects in the following ways:<P>

<UL><LI><B>Improve Information Flow:</B>  BXA publishes a series of Defense Business Directories to disseminate information on business opportunities in the NIS.  The directories are intended to facilitate U.S. private foreign investment in defense conversion projects in Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakstan.  In June 1995, BXA published a Directory covering over 300 converting Russian defense enterprises.  And in June 1996, BXA published a new Ukrainian business directory that includes profiles on over 80 converting Ukrainian defense enterprises.  BXA will soon publish a new Russian directory focusing on defense enterprises in the St. Petersburg area.  These directories are available on-line electronically and also are distributed in hardcopy to thousands of U.S. businesses.<P>

BXA informs U.S. industry about new developments related to defense conversion through its series of industry round tables.  Over the past year, BXA has arranged and hosted five industry round tables, with each attracting 40-50 industry representatives.  On May 13, BXA held another round table featuring the President of Udmurtiya, an autonomous republic in Russia with the highest concentration of defense industries in the country.<P>  

<LI><B>Facilitate Business Contacts and Agreements:</B> BXA pursues a number of steps aimed at increasing contacts between potential partners and bringing potential deals to fruition.  This includes BXA-organized events such as the recently concluded Entrepreneurial and Defense Conversion Conference in Yekaterinburg, Russia (funded by the Agency for International Development)  that was held on May 21-24 and included almost 40 U.S. business representatives interested in pursuing business ventures in the region.  It also includes jointly-sponsored events, such as the BXA and Department of Defense co- sponsored conference on Business Opportunities in Ukraine, held June 5-7 near Los Angeles, California highlighting business opportunities with 14 major Ukrainian aerospace, electronics, and heavy equipment industries, and the BXA-DOD co-sponsored Russian Project Finance Conference  in New York on June 27-28 that sought to identify sources of financing for U.S.-Russian defense conversion business ventures.  BXA also works with hundreds of U.S. company representatives who call in for advice and assistance in removing stumbling blocks to specific deals.<P> 

<LI><B>Conduct Training: </B> To help remedy NIS managers' continued lack of understanding of Western business practices this, BXA and the Special American Business Internship Training Program <A Href="http://www.itaiep.doc.gov/sabit/onepage.html"><B><I>(SABIT)</I></B></A> are jointly running a special defense conversion program to provide NIS participants with training and exposure to U.S. businesses.  Under this program, defense industry executives and local officials are brought to the United States for eight weeks to learn about defense conversion and private enterprise in this country.  Since the SABIT defense conversion program began in June 1995, there have been four sessions that have provided training to a total of approximately 80 interns.  A large percentage of the interns receiving training have formed some form of business relationship with their company hosts.  The next SABIT session is planned for October 1996. <P>

<LI><B>Help to Remove Obstacles:</B>  BXA also works to improve the overall business environment in the NIS countries and remove stumbling blocks to specific defense conversion deals.  Working closely with host government officials through the bilateral Defense Conversion Committees and the Business Development Committees, BXA helps address such issues of concern to defense conversion joint ventures as high and unpredictable taxes and tariff regimes, the progress of privatization, and the need for public availability of NIS legislation and regulations affecting U.S. industry involvement with NIS defense enterprises.</UL><P>
