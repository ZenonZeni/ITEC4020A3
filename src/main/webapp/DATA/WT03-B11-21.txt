DEFENSE CONVERSION IS AN OPTION, BUT IT WILL NOT
HEAL WOUNDS OF CONTRACTION, EXECUTIVES ARGUE

        Successful diversification into new commercial markets is
possible for defense contractors, but it will never make up for
the loss of jobs and revenue stemming from nearly a decade of
defense cutbacks.
        That was the consensus among three top executives of the
defense/aerospace industry at last week's Global Air & Space 94
International Business Forum and Exhibition, in Arlington, Va.
        The executives who expressed these views were: Richard D.
Brandes, senior vice president of GM Hughes Electrics; Sam Araki,
executive vice president of Lockheed Missiles & Space Co.; and
Peter Teets, president of the space group for Martin Marietta
Corp.
        Successful defense conversion on any scale requires time,
patience and a federal government that understands the challenges
defense firms face as the industry continues to contract, they
said.
        "Our entry into commercial markets did not happen
overnight," said Brandes. "It has taken about thirty years to
establish our position in what was unchartered territory for us."
        Hughes Electronics' voyage into the commercial marketplace
began shortly after the defense electronics firm launched its
first geosynchronous satellite for the U.S. government in 1963.
Shortly thereafter, Hughes entered the commercial satellite
business, which today brings in about $2 billion each year for
the company.
        At last week's defense business forum, Hughes made no secret
of its interest in commercial markets with a massive tele-visual
exhibit of its projects in satellite-based communications markets
such as DirecTV, which will offer hundreds of channel options for
homeviewers.
        "Some of these markets could develop into larger businesses,
but there is no way to make up for the losses we continue to face
in [defense-related] downsizing," said Brandes.
        He added that successful conversion cannot happen within the
confines of existing defense industry structures. While many
commercial technologies may have spun out of defense-related
applications, Brandes says it is critically important to create
new business structures within parent firms that focus solely on
commercial markets.
        Lockheed's Araki agreed with Brandes. Though Lockheed has
aggressively entered the commercial space markets of remote
sensing and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology, so far it
has fallen far short of making up for its 50 percent decrease in
size over the past decade.
        Araki said that space/defense contractors must do a better
job of marketing their technologies and making sure that space-
based technologies get the same attention that defense spin-offs
have. "The Clinton administration has not treated space with as
much advocacy as it has other technology industries," he
contends.
        "If we [as a country] do not address these issues, the space
industry will never again be as dominant in the global
marketplace as it was during the Cold War."

NORTHERN TELECOM TO TRANSFER $330M WORTH OF WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY

        Moving aggressively into a market that could reach $3
billion by 1996. Northern Telecom Ltd. (NT) last week announced a
$330 million agreement to provide digital wireless telephone
services in Mexico.
        According to Frank McNally, Washington, D.C.-based spokesman
for NT, this marks the largest technology transfer ever for the
company's wireless business.
        David Twyver, president of NT's wireless systems group, said
sales from his division could shoot up to $1 billion next year as
the company takes advantage of the growing market for wireless
telephone services in developing countries and the demand for
cheaper mobile phone service in the U.S.
        In just the last two months, NT has signed wireless
agreements with the countries of Uzbekistan, Columbia, and
Finland. The Toronto-based telecom firm is currently negotiating
an agreement with Ionica of the United Kingdom.
        With few telephone lines in many developing countries,
digital wireless access technology offers an inexpensive way to
get telephone service to remote areas. According to Twyver,
copper lines cost around $1,200-$1,300 per subscriber and can run
as high as $2,000. For wireless access service, the cost is under
$1,000 per subscriber.

SUPER BATTERY?

        Bolder Technologies Corp., of Wheat Ridge, Colo., last week
announced it will get $100,000 from the Advanced Research
Projects Agency to develop a battery with a cell size of 30 amp
hours. The Thin Metal Technology battery could be used for
electric cars, hybrid vehicles and lawn mowers. If initial tests
are successful, Bolder hopes to gain an additional $750,000 from
ARPA to fund pilot production.

ENVIRONMENTAL TECH TRANSFER.

        The United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) will open an
environmental technology center in Osaka, Japan this month to
help transfer environmentally sound technologies between East
Asian countries. According to Elizabeth Dowdsdell, agency
director, "UNEP would like to see the [center] evolve as a
proactive intermediator between sources and users of
environmentally sound technology by systematically building up the
capacity of developing countries to choose, digest and utilize
these technologies." The program will focus primarily on enviro-
management in big cities.

DON'T CLOSE, COMMERCIALIZE!

        Hoping to forestall the closure of McClellan Air Force Base,
in Sacramento, Calif., local officials last week launched a
coalition they hope will spawn a booming high-tech presence in
the region. The coalition, called the Sacramento Regional
Economic Development Alliance (REDA), is designed to foster
commercial use of some of the high-tech capabilities at McClellan
Air Force Base. Local leaders hope the Pentagon will eventually
view McClellan as too valuable to the military and business
sector to be shuttered. But Kenneth Flamm, assistant to the under
secretary of defense and a specialist in dual-use issues, warned
McClellan advocates not to count on the base being spared.

AN ODD TRADING COUPLE.

        Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, during a trade visit here
last week, urged the U.S. not to let political and social
differences between China and the U.S. stand in the way of a
fruitful economic and technological cooperation. He warned that to
discontinue China's Most Favored Nation trade status could
jeopardize that cooperation. Zou said that over the 15 years since
China and the United States established diplomatic relations,
despite ups and downs, difficulties and disputes, the overall
relations between the two countries have moved forward with
exchanges and cooperation in various fields such as information
technology.

TO BE, OR NOT TO BE ... A SUBSIDY.

        An editorial in last Wednesday's Financial Times sharply
criticized the Clinton administration's increased involvement in
U.S. industrial policy. "Old fashioned industrial intervention is
being glossed up and justified under the heading of technology
policy," the editorial said. "But the familiar shape of the pork
barrel is already discernible." The editorial asserts that the
administration is abusing the leverage it gained preserving R&D
subsidies during the recent Uruguay round of trade talks. While the
Times questions the integrity using federal money to subsidize
domestic manufacturing, as is the case with the Pentagon's recent
Flat Panel Display initiative (TTW, May 3, p.1), it also suggests
such endeavors have a history of failure.

WATKINS-JOHNSON'S TWO-PRONGED CONVERSION STRATEGY PAYING OFF

        Despite hard times in the early 1990s, Palo Alto, Calif-
based Watkins-Johnson Co., is finding success with its two
pronged strategy to drive its business away from strict
dependence on the defense market.
        The company is taking advantage of federal defense
conversion initiatives to supplement its own R&D investments in
commercial and dual-use projects, while expanding its
international operations by opening up new, larger facilities in
Asia.
     As an example of the first part of its strategy, W-J is in
the process of negotiating the specifics on a Technology
Reinvestment Project (TRP) award valued at $11 million to develop
a Spatial Division Multiple Access (SDMA) digital base station
for the Personal Communication Services (PCS) wireless market.
     The system will incorporate such advanced technologies as
SMART antenna systems, high-performance digitizers and power
amplifiers.
     The company teamed with ArrayComm, Inc. (Santa Clara,
Calif.), and Spectrian (Mountainview, Calif.) to put up $5.5
million matched by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA).
The team will employ dual-use technology in the hopes of
establishing themselves in the PCS market.
        To further offset declining demand in the U.S. defense
sector, W-J has been actively expanding its overseas presence,
particularly in Korea and Japan.  According to W-J documents, the
company expanded office space and staff in Korea, and has plans
to do the same in its Japanese subsidiary during the first half
of 1994.
        This internationalization is designed to get the company
closer to the Pacific Rim's growing base of customers, says
manager of production and information, Frank E. Emery.
        Indeed, the company will market one third of its
semiconductor equipment production to foreign customers this
year. This move, industry analysts say, will contribute
significantly to the estimated 50 percent growth that this facet
of the business is expected to achieve in 1994.
        Elliot H. Rogers, analyst for New York-based Cowen & Company
says this strategy is moving the company in the right direction.
In 1991 and 1992 W-J experienced revenue contractions due to
shrinking sales in the defense industry, but has--with $286
million posted in 1993--begun to experience a sales rebound.
        However, according to Emery, success in defense conversion
has not come easily. Changes in production focus and the
company's infrastructure led to high restructuring charges and a
20 percent work force reduction in 1991. Even so, the company has
still not reached its 1990 sales high of $311 million.
        Moreover, Rogers says that if W-J is to build on its current
success, it will have to be aware of a growing base of
competitors chasing the same semiconductor equipment dollars.
        According to Rogers, W-J's main competitor is Novellus
Systems of San Jose, Calif. Novellus has increased its net sales
from 1992 to 1993 by 63 percent. Current annual sales are pegged
at $113.5 million. In the 1980s only 15 percent of W-J's sales
were commercial, while 85 percent were in defense. Today 40
percent of sales come from non-defense business.

NAVY DUAL USE PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON FIVE TECHNOLOGY AREAS

        The Department of the Navy is putting the finishing touches
on defense conversion funding of its own for FY 95. An official
announcement should be made within the next several weeks,
according to Navy spokesman Marc Whetstone.
        Similar to the Technology Reinvestment Project (TRP), the
program will focus on developing and deploying dual use
technologies. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) plans to solicit
topics in ocean platforms, ocean environment, aircraft platforms,
information systems and control, and human systems.
        Unlike the TRP, however, this program will not necessarily
require that industry partners invest 50 percent or more to a
project, according to Rear Adm. Marc Pelaez, chief of Naval
Research.
        As reported earlier (TTW, April 19, p.6), this Navy defense
technology program will be funded with about $50 million from the
Navy's science and technology budget.
        The ONR is currently in the process of creating a program
brochure which will be sent to any companies requesting
information. Whetstone says the brochure will give a detailed
description of the technology areas the Navy is interested in,
information for submitting proposals, and the necessary forms.
        For more information contact Whetstone at ONR, 703/696-5032.

GOVERNMENT ASKS INDUSTRY TO TAKE LEAD ON FSU CONVERSION, TECH
TRANSFER

        Companies such as Amoco, EG&G, MC Power, Babcock and Wilcox,
Jaycor and Merrill Lynch attended a workshop held late last month
to explore cooperative research projects with Russian and
Ukrainian research institutions, according to Mike Deegan, vice
president of Teledyne, Inc. and interim president of the U.S.
Industry Coalition (USIC).
        USIC, currently funded by the U.S. government through the
Department of Energy (DoE) at $35 million, encourages cooperative
ventures with Russian labs to engage nuclear scientists and
engineers in non-weapons-related work. But it also aims to
provide Russian institutions with U.S. firms' knowledge of
project management, market research and other aspects of business
development and management.
        By gathering together experts from DoE laboratories,
industry, and universities with some background in Ukrainian
affairs, the group hopes to provide a network of contacts to
match potential U.S. contracts with FSU partners. While the U.S.
partners will fund their own R&D and provide business training to
the labs, USIC's $35 million will fund the FSU research effort.
        But "this is not just a give-away program," Deegan said.
"[U.S. partners] will get a marketable product that can be sold
in Russia, the U.S. or both."
        Another incentive for U.S. firms to do business with FSU
labs is that costs for research are far lower than those in the
U.S. The projects will probably cost under $1 million each,
Deegan said.
        "The objective is to spread the wealth, and we can better do
that by funding 40 projects rather than 12," he said.
        The program is good for both U.S. industry as well as
Ukraine, Nadia McConnell, president of the non-profit U.S.-
Ukraine Foundation points out.
        In addition to providing a "springboard" to transfer
military work done in Ukrainian labs to industrial base
development, "it allows U.S. industry to plug into DoE labs," she
said, adding that the project will also boost the presence of
U.S. firms in Ukraine and Russia.

 ...Program Looking for Quick Turn Around

        "We want to get technologies that can be produced and
commercialized in 16-18 months," Deegan said, adding, "We are
targeted to a range of firms," not just small or large, with a
range of technology development interests.
        If a U.S. firm is interested in developing a new product in
conjunction with a Ukrainian institute, USIC says it can provide
the firm with the appropriate contacts in Ukrainian labs. Once
the cooperative project had been negotiated, they would sign a
Project Letter Agreement.
        "The only financial risk is the R&D, which the U.S. firm
undertakes itself," Deegan said. The Russian partner is paid
through cash transfers from government accounts set up by USIC.
There is no funding limit on individual projects.
        There are already around 300 collaborations between Russian,
Ukrainian and DoE institutions that have been established over
the past three years under various programs, but this is the
first government-industry partnership that is a for-profit
enterprise, Deegan said.
        Electronics, communications, and biomedics offer good
potential for developing new products, Deegan said.
        Despite the poor reputation of the health care system of the
Soviet Union, there are some medical areas in which the Russians
are actually ahead of the West, he added.
        Some of the more high-tech physics and engineering projects
include a venture to create a model to determine material
strength, fracture and failure levels and an initiative to
develop system and application software for parallel computing.

NIST TO FOCUS $745M TOWARD LONG-RANGE ADVANCED TECH PROGRAMS

        Industry welcomed NIST's announcement last week that it
would focus its next round of the Advanced Technology Program on
five specific technology areas. But some are complaining that
since the funding is spread out over five years, the money
doesn't seem like all that much.
        The agency will spent $745 million over the next five years,
matched by an equal amount from industry, to develop advanced
technologies in critical areas such as DNA analysis and computer
integrated manufacturing.
        "I think it's a good idea that NIST is focusing on specific
areas," says Walt Finkelstein, president of Advanced Lithography
Group, of Columbia, Md. "This method allows companies in those
areas to have a better competitive edge in winning funding."
        However, he says that $745 million over five years does not
seem like a lot of money considering that the budget for the 1994
Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP) is nearly $650 million for
just one year.
        The program will focus on five specific areas which were
selected based on industry suggestions, and evaluated against
four criteria: potential benefit to the U.S., strength of
technical ideas, evidence of strong industry commitment, and the
opportunity for ATP funds to make a difference in moving
technology forward. The five areas are:

        *  Tools for DNA Diagnostics - A five-year, $145 million
        program to develop compact, low cost, automated DNA analysis
        technologies and equipment.
        *  Information Infrastructure for Health Care - A five-year,
        $185 million program to develop an information
        infrastructure to enable integrated medical information
        systems.
        *  Manufacturing Composite Structures - A five year, $160
        million program to reduce the high initial cost of using
        advanced composite materials for commercial applications
        such as bridges and automobiles.
        *  Component-Based Software - A five-year, $150 million
        program to develop technologies necessary to enable
        systematically re-useable software components.
        *  Computer-Integrated Manufacturing for Electronics - A
        five-year, $105 million program to develop a flexible
        software-based framework to boost manufacturing
        productivity.

        Interested companies may apply for up to $2 million over
three years. Joint ventures of two or more companies can apply
for five years worth of funding with no dollar limit. NIST will
sponsor a series of public meetings on the program. The first
will be held June 2-3, at the Holiday Inn, Gaithersburg, Md. For
more information call 1-800 ATP-FUND.
        Because full proposals can get expensive, NIST suggests that
companies first submit abbreviated proposals for funding in the
form of a white paper to allow NIST to determine if the project
has the potential to meet the needs of the program.
