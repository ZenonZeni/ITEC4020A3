 children from brain tumors</B></CENTER></P>

A report from the Children's Cancer Group (United States and Canada) shows that a
maternal diet that includes vitamins C and E inhibits the formation of carcinogenic
nitrosamines.  Nitrosamines are compounds that develop from the ingestion of nitrites
and nitrates, and can lead to brain tumors.  Nitrites are used as a color fixative in
the multibillion-dollar-a-year cured-meat business.  They impart a blood-redness to
processed meats such as bacon, bologna, frankfurters, deviled ham, meat spread,
potted meats, spiced ham, Vienna sausages, and even smoke-cured tuna fish products. 
Nitrates come from vegetables grown in soils with nitrate fertilizers.  Nitrates turn
into nitrites on exposure to air.

<BR><B>Editor's note</B>: <I>The amount of vitamin E generally recommended is 400 IU.  Vitamin
C reqtiirements vary with individuals and should be taken to &quot;bowel tolerance,&quot; as
taught to us by Robert Cathcart, MD, of San Mateo, CA.  Cathcart advises that we take
just enough to avoid causing a bubbly stomach.  For some people, one or two grams
suffice; for others, more than 10 grams daily are necessary before reaching
tolerance.  If taking large amounts, buffered or ester-C is recommended.</I>

A total of 65 patients with bladder cancer were enrolled in a random study.  One
group was given vitamins in the low RDA amounts; another group was given 40,000 units
of vitamin A, I 00 milligrams of vitamin B6, 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 units
of vitamin E, and 90 milligrams of zinc-far in excess of the RDAS.  Recurrence of
bladder tumor was remarkably reduced after ten months in patients receiving the
megadose vitamins.

Women who consume a moderate amount of alcohol are at 40 to I 00 percent greater

in levels of several hormones.  Premenopausal women who consume moderate amounts of
alcohol show increases in both total estrogen levels and the amount of bioavallable

The association between cured meat consumption of pregnant women and children was
examined in relation to childhood cancer.  Five meat groups (ham, bacon, or sausage;
hot dogs; hamburgers; bologna, pastrami corned beef, salami, or lunch meat;
charcoal-grilled foods) were assessed.  Maternal hot-dog consumption of one or more
times per week was associated with childhood brain tumors; for children, eating hot
dogs one or more times per week caused the same association.  Among children, the
combination of no vitamins and eating meats was more strongly related to brain cancer
than either no vitamins or meat consumption alone.

        One hundred nineteen colorectal cancer patients were interviewed about their
personal dietary habits using a questionnaire concerning the frequency of consumption
of 70 foods and beverages.  An equal number of control subjects were randomly
selected from the lists of general practitioners during the same period and
interviewed with the same food frequency questionnaire.  The risk of colorectal
cancer increased nearly threefold for the highest level of consumption of foods with
a high content of refined sugar.  An inverse relationship was revealed for the
highest consumption of raw and cooked vegetables.
