<P>Fehmi Tosun, a 36-year-old construction worker, was last seen in the custody of three plainclothes officers outside his home in the Avcilar district of Istanbul in October 1995. Hanim Tosun describes the last time she saw her husband: <I>"…I went out on to the balcony. I saw two burly people holding Fehmi by the arms and dragging him towards a white Broadway car. Fehmi was shouting, ‘Help, they are taking me away to kill me’ and struggling not to be put in the car. I ran down shouting. When I got there they had not yet put Fehmi in the car. He was shouting all the time. I ran towards the car, but it drove away at speed."</I>
<P>Hanim Tosun’s appeals to the authorities for information have gone unanswered. She and her daughters do not know what has happened to him. The authorities have shown a callous lack of concern for the families of the "disappeared". Relatives who have tried to draw attention to their plight have faced further violations of their human rights.
<P>Kiymet Tekin said that she was kicked and insulted and called "a mother of a terrorist" when she went to inquire about her son Ahmet Tekin, who was detained while on a bus travelling from Diyarbakir to the village of Darakol on 7 May 1994. Ahmet was never seen again. Hurmuz Diril, an elder of Kovankaya village in Hakkari province was imprisoned when he went to Beytüssebab to make inquiries about Ilyas Edip Diril and Zeki Ercan Diril, two "disappeared" children of his village. Emine Ocak, mother of Hasan Ocak who "disappeared" in Istanbul in March 1995 and whose body was later found on vacant ground, was beaten by police at her son’s graveside in July 1995. Her daughter Maside was one of 42 people beaten, dragged along the ground and detained overnight after coming to pay their respects.

<P>"Disappearances" are a new and disturbing development in Turkey. Ten years ago, people did not "disappear" in Turkey. In 1994 there were more than 50 reported "disappearances", the highest number in any country according to the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.
<P>For many years Amnesty International highlighted the factors which contribute to human rights abuses: long periods of incommunicado detention and interrogation; official refusal to investigate allegations of human rights violations; the almost complete impunity enjoyed by members of security forces responsible for violations; and a legal and judicial framework which sanctions these practices. These factors persist and are now contributing to the increasing incidence of "disappearances".
<P>"Disappearance" is a human rights violation inflicted not only upon the victims but also upon their families. The law as well as brute force has been used to suppress campaigns by the families of the "disappeared" to find out what happened to their loved ones and to bring those responsible to justice. Relatives who have attempted to draw public attention to their plight have been subjected to insults, beatings and detention by police.
