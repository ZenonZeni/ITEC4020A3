<H2>Case Study: Electricity for a Utility Substation</H2>

<P>
Pacific Gas and Electric Company's (PG&E) Kerman substation, near
Fresno, California, was becoming overloaded on hot summer days
when air-conditioning and water-pumping needs are at their
greatest and the utility experiences its peak demand. Overloading
heats up substation components, which shortens the life of
expensive transformers, reduces power quality for customers, and
increases line losses during transmission. Analysts in PG&E's
research group looked to a PV array to meet the extra demand at
Kerman, because it occurred on days when the solar cells would be
producing well.

of this system to PG&E in hopes of demonstrating yet another use

<p>The analysts at PG&E believed using PV to support a substation
during peaks in electrical demand might make economic sense for
their utility, but no one knew quantitatively how much the PV
grid support would be worth. Because upgrading the Kerman
substation would cost several million dollars, PG&E decided to
install a PV system as a research project (as part of the PV for Utility-Scale Applications
project) to evaluate the benefits of grid support. 

<p>The PV system, installed at Kerman in 1993, produces the most power
on sunny summer afternoons, when PG&E experiences its peak demand
and when electricity has the highest value to the utility. The PV
system maintains its electrical output close to its rated
capacity with the PV modules mounted on trackers that change the
tilt of the modules as the sun moves across the sky during this
critical period. 

<p>The Kerman substation experiment is designed to measure the value
to the utility of a 500-kW generating plant that can be quickly
(within 6 months) placed where extra power is needed. Monitors
record electrical output throughout the day and provide detailed
information on system output. The results of this experiment will
be widely distributed among utilities across the country.
