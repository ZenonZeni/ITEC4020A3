<H3>Professor Matt Miller<BR>
<HR></H3>
There's been another new addition to our faculty since the previous issue
of this Newsletter. Matthew P. Miller joined us in January 1994.<BR>
<BR>
Matt Miller has a somewhat different background from the typical Assistant
Professor starting out in teaching. Matt graduated from the University of
Colorado with a degree in Geology and was named All-American lineman in
football. He then joined the Cleveland Browns of the NFL and played on their
offensive line for four years, and two years with the Denver Gold in the
USFL, before returning to the Colorado School of Mines to obtain a degree
in Mechanical Engineering. He subsequently received his Ph.D. in Mechanical
Engineering from Georgia Tech in June 1993. Matt's research interests are
mainly in the area of materials processing, with emphasis on the mechanical
behavior of materials. <BR>
