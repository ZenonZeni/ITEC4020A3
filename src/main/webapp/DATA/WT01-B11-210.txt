<B>Ontario's Provincial Parks Start Reservations May 1</B>
</CENTER><P>
Ontario's provincial parks system is standardizing its 1996 campsite reservation service, meaning most park reservations will begin being accepted May 1.<P>   
                              
There are only four exceptions to this policy:  Algonquin, Point Farms and Sauble Falls, where reservation services open April 1, and Quetico which accepts reservations starting February 1 as part of backcountry travel packages.<P>
               
In the past, a few other provincial parks have also offered early reservation services.  Campers who have previously booked campsites at these parks by telephone, mail, or in-person will now be able to do so, beginning May 1.<P>
               
"This measure will reduce our operating costs," said Natural Resources Minister Chris Hodgson. "We have tried to choose cost-saving measures that have the least impact on our park customers.  We will have more than two months in which to process reservations before the busy July-August camping period," Mr. Hodgson added.<P>
               
"We will be working hard to accept customers' requests starting May 1," said Ontario Parks Managing Director, Norm Richards.  "This year, another eight parks will implement the new computerized reservation/registration system, which will allow us to process applications faster.  Now more than 80 per cent of our reservations will be handled through this computer service." <P>
