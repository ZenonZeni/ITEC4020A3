Immigration, Naturalization Up in FY96</h2>

<ul>

<p>

There were 720,461 people admitted as immigrants in FY95, down 10

percent from 804,416 in FY94; an estimated one million people were admitted as

immigrants in FY96.  Much of the drop in FY95 was due to INS problems in

implementing the so-called 245i adjustment procedure under which persons in the

US can adjust their status to become immigrants rather than return to their

countries of citizenship before immigrating to the US.<p>

The INS argued in March 1996, in support of those in Congress who wanted to

consider legal and illegal immigration separately, that there was no need to

reduce legal immigration, since immigration levels were already falling.  In

May 1996, Congressional leaders of immigration subcommittees accused the INS of

misleading the public about future immigration levels when releasing the FY95

figures (MN, June 1996).<p>

The US government anticipates the arrival of 675,000 immigrants each year,

including 480,000 family unification, 140,000 economic/employment-based and

55,000 diversity immigrants.  In addition, there also are refugees, the number

being determined each year by the President in consultation with Congress.

<p>

Between 1986 and 1995, about 12 million immigrants were admitted legally to

the US--some were in the US earlier and had their status legalized in this

period.  The previous peak period of immigration was 1905-1914, when 10 million

immigrants arrived.<p>

Most immigrants over the past 10 years--66 percent--were women and children

and most of the adults were unskilled or had less than a high school education.

About 75 percent of the immigrants were from Asian, Latin American or Caribbean

countries and 66 percent settled in California, New York, Texas, Florida,

Illinois and New Jersey.<p>

About 2.7 million unauthorized immigrants were legalized.  At least three

million additional illegal aliens entered the US and stayed.<p>

A December 1996 poll by the Wall Street Journal/NBC News reported that 72

percent of respondents would like to see immigration reduced.  A similar

question in 1965 found that 33 percent of Americans wanted to reduce

immigration.<p>

The INS in December released detailed immigration data for FY95 and

reported that 166,482 immigrants intended to settle in California, down from

208,498 in FY94.  About 12 percent of US immigrants in FY95, and 21 percent of

California immigrants, were from Mexico.<p>

Some 1.3 million foreigners applied to become naturalized US citizens in

FY96 and 1.1 million became US citizens.  The INS estimates that 1.8 million

foreigners may apply for naturalization in FY97.<p>

In November 1995, the INS changed its naturalization procedures.  INS now

requires that, before naturalization, the FBI certify that the fingerprints

submitted by the applicant are not associated with any crimes in the US.

Previously, the INS merely assumed that there was no US crime if the FBI did

not produce evidence to the contrary within 120 days.  <p>

The time between applying for naturalization and being sworn in as a US

citizen is usually less than six months.  The tighter clearance procedure has

slowed the process, however, and some advocates have complained that welfare

benefits may be delayed as a result.  <p>

INS workers in Miami, where 140,000 persons were naturalized in FY96,

charged that 10,000 foreigners were naturalized without FBI fingerprint checks.

The INS workers charged that swearing-in ceremonies were sometimes scheduled

for applicants one week after their initial INS interviews, so that there was

no time for background checks.<p>

Because the criminal checks may have been faulty, the INS, under the

supervision of accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick, is reviewing all citizenship

cases completed in FY96.<p>

The Justice Department rejected a November 1, 1996 request to appoint an

independent prosecutor to investigate Citizenship USA.<p>

Acting on its own, the INS has begun to revoke the citizenship of criminals

who were naturalized.  Under new regulations that have not yet been tested in

court, the INS, without judicial proceedings, is denaturalizing persons who

obtained citizenship by, for example, concealing criminal convictions.  Some

70,000 of the 1.1 million persons naturalized in FY96 had arrest records, but

an arrest does not automatically disqualify an alien for naturalization.<p>

The Justice Department in December released $495 million to states as

reimbursement for the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens, representing 60

percent of the $825 requested by state and local governments.  <p>
