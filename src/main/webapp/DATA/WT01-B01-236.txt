SEA Semester is the academic adventure of a lifetime! A 12-week
program offered in several sessions throughout the year, SEA Semester
offers you a unique experience studying off campus -- and offshore,
and earns you a full semester of college credit. SEA Semester
integrates marine science, maritime literature, history and policy,
and practical seamanship with deep-water oceanographic research.

<P>
The six week <I><B>Shore Component</B></I> in Woods Hole combines
lectures, hands-on workshops, small-group discussions and field
excursions in an intensive, focused, interdisciplinary curriculum.
Then, during the subsequent <I><B>SEA Component,</B></I> you set
sail on board one of SEA's sailing research vessels, the <I>Westward
</I>or the <I>Corwith Cramer</I>, and put into practice the knowledge
you learned ashore.
<P>
Working in small teams with the crew and fellow students, you
sail, navigate and conduct research in the waters of the Atlantic
Ocean and Carribean Sea and become a vital, contributing member
of the ship's company. As the voyage progresses, you take on more
of the responsibility for the nautical, scientific and day-to-day
operations of the ship. Your work in oceanography and in the shipboard
lab gives you new insights into the scientific process, and an
understanding of the interrelationships between earth, ocean and
atmosphere. By the end of the program, you have completed an original
research project and have tested new skills and knowledge in the
world offshore.<HR>

<H3>The Shore Component</H3>

<P>
In the Shore Component, students enroll in three concurrent, three-credit
courses: Oceanography, Nautical Science, and Maritime Studies.
These courses are taught in a traditional classroom setting with
lectures, discussions, laboratory sessions, workshops, and field
trips. Classes are conducted by SEA faculty with occasional visiting
scholars from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, the Marine
Biological Laboratory, and other academic and oceanographic organizations.
Students who successfully complete the Shore Component participate
in the Sea Component aboard the <I>Westward </I>or <I>Corwith
Cramer</I>. <A HREF="courses.htm">SEA Semester Course Syllabus</A>.
<P>
The SEA Semester Shore Component is taught at SEA's five-acre
campus in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The students live in SEA's
five cottages which can house a total of 50 students and are fully
equipped with cooking facilities. Students attend classes
in SEA's <A HREF="madden.htm">James L. Madden Center for Maritime Studies</A>
which contains a lecture hall, a teaching laboratory, student
study areas, a student computer room, a library and offices for
faculty and administrative staff.
<P>
Students have access to classrooms, library, computer room and
study areas 24 hours daily. Faculty are available for consultation
daily outside normal class hours. In addition, students receive
library cards for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution/Marine
Biological Laboratory Library which is widely recognized as one
of the best marine science libraries in the world.
<P>
The daily schedule contains a long lunch break during which students
can attend professional seminars frequently offered at the Woods
Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Marine Biological Laboratory
(MBL), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS), Woods Hole Research Center (WHRC), and other institutions
in the area.
<P>
Shore Component courses are taught by a faculty team which includes:
oceanography faculty who sail as Chief Scientists with the students;
nautical science faculty who sail as Captains of the ships; and
maritime studies faculty who teach primarily on shore. The close
working relationships that develop among faculty and students
on shore continue to develop at sea and result in a 12-week, intensive,
focused educational experience that is seldom possible in a typical
campus setting.
<H3>The Sea Component</H3>

<P>
In the Sea Component, students enroll in two sequential, four-credit
courses: Practical Oceanography I and Practical Oceanography II,
each of which lasts three weeks. Each day students spend two hours
in lecture plus an additional four to six hours on watch, involved
in every phase of the ship's scientific research and in the attendant
duties of sailing, navigating, and operating an oceanographic
research vessel. During the Sea Component, students assume increasing
responsibility for the safe and orderly conduct of both scientific
activities and ship operations. 
<H3>Admission</H3>

<P>
Admission to SEA Semester is by competitive selection and is determined
by an Admission Committee. To be admitted, students must be in
good academic standing and must have successfully completed the
equivalent of one college-level laboratory science course. SEA
admits students on a rolling admission basis after reviewing high
school and college transcripts, standardized test scores, personal
statements, references, and alumni interviews. Admission decisions
are financially need-blind. More information on <A HREF="../admissn/adtop.htm">Admissions?</A>

<H3>Financial Aid</H3>

<P>
Financial assistance is available for SEA Semester and SEA Summer
Session students. Federal financial aid transfers directly to
SEA. Some colleges and universities transfer their own financial
aid for their students who are admitted to SEA Semester. SEA also
awards its own grants and loans. In addition, SEA periodically
awards a small number of full-tuition, academic-merit scholarships.
