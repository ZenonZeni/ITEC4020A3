<h2><FONT COLOR="#0000DD">Trademark Procedures</font></h2>
The procedure for selecting a new product name and obtaining a trademark 
registration in the United States and throughout the world involves the following
steps: selection, search, adoption, registration, and maintenance. It is
a process which is cost-effective in the long run because many potential
conflicts are elminiated or reduced if the steps in the process are
followed carefully.<P>
<A NAME="selection">
<h3><font color="C50B21">Selection</font></h3>
The process begins when a business unit selects a name for a new product. 
Because a name may already be used as a trademark by another company, a 
business unit should select and prioritize at least three names.<P>

From a legal point of view, distinctiveness is very important in selecting 
a mark. The most distinctive marks are coined terms which were originally
meaningless. Also distinctive, though not a coined term, is the arbitrary
term which is otherwise meaningless when applied to the product. The more original
and unique the name or symbol, the lesser the chance of infringing the
rights of others and the greater the ease in protecting the mark.<P>
<blockquote>
	COINED TERM: 		KODAK for cameras<br>
	ARBITRARY TERM:		CANDY for shoes<br>
</blockquote>
<P>

After selection and at least six months prior to printing the sales literature,
the business unit supplies the Legal Department with the following
information:<P>

<ul>
<li>	The spelling, appearance, and derivation of the selected name(s)<br>
<li> 	A description of the product<br>
<li>	Any literature on the product<br>
<li>	Projected date of first sale</br>
<li>	Countries in which the product is sold or will be sold</br>
<li>	List of its competitors
</ul><P>
<A NAME="search">
<h3><font color="C50B21">Search</font></h3>
An outside legal firm contracted by the Varian Legal Department will use this
information to search through on-line databases for an intial idea of whether
the name may conflict with an existing name. If the in-house search is clear, 
the firm orders commercial searches which are more involved. They reduce the
possibility that Varian might adopt a trademark that infringes on another 
party's trademark rights. The search steps are as follows:<P>

<ol>
	<li> The firm conducts an in-house database search for the name(s) in
	trademark databases covering the United States, Canada, and Great Britain.<br>
	<li> The firm analyzes the in-house search to determine whether another 
	company is using the same or similar name for a for a similar product and
	how likely the other company is to object to Varian's use.<br>
	<li> The analysis and search are sent to the business unit for review
	and for a decision on whether to pursue the name. If there are possible
	conflicts, depending on the severity of the conflicts the business
	unit may:<P>
		<ol type=a>
		<li>Abandon its choice(s) and select another name.<br>
		<li>Proceed with the commercial search.<br>
		</ol><P>
	<li> If, after the in-house search, the business unit wants to pursue
	its use of the name, the firm requests commercial searches -- a World search
	and a U.S. search. The World commercial search looks for possible conflicts
	throughout the world, and the United States search looks for conflicts with
	both registered and unregistered trademarks in the United States. The
	cost of a Full United States Search is approximately $320.00, and the
	cost of the World Wide Identical Screening Search is approximately $550.00<P>
	<li> Upon receipt of the commercial search, our law firm analyzes the
	searches with the same basic process used for the in-house search.<P>
	<li>The analysis and search are sent to the business unit for review, and 
	the business unit decides whether it wants to pursue the name or select
	a new name.
</ol><P>
If the business unit decides to pursue a name despite possible conflicts,
the business unit may:
<ol type=a>
	
<li> Write to the owner of the conflicting mark asking for clearance
to use the mark.<BR>
<li> Use the name with the understanding that there may be an 
infringement problem and that it may have to stop its use of the
name and re-establish customer association with the product using
a new name.<P>
</ol> 



If it is decided to select a new name, the search procedure must be
repeated for the new name. This, of course, takes additional time.<P>
	
If the name is selected, the name is adopted for use as an unregistered
trademark, and if appropriate, steps are taken to register the trademark.<P>
	
<strong>Note:</strong> Although commercial searches are thorough, they
cannot guarantee absence of conflicts. Searches do not have the capability
of finding every similar name, for instance, nor can a search uncover
names that are not recorded in a trademark office.<P>
<A NAME="adoption">	
	<h3><font color="C50B21">Adoption</font></h3>
	
<ol>
	<li>After a name has been searched and selected for use, the business
	unit may use the ham. Through use, the name b ecomes an unregistered 
	trademark and can be designated with a &#156; in the United States (see
	Proper Use of Trademarks). Sales and shipments in interstate commerce
	of goods bearing the trademark establish the date of first use and form
	the basis for our trademark rights against anyone who subsequently 
	adopts the mark. Internal shipment or mailing is not sufficient. Ensure
	that the mark is affixed to the goods or its container. Although use
	of a name solely in advertising is not sufficient for trademark rights,
	use of a name solely in advertising is sufficient for service marks.<P>
	<li> Our law firm and business unit decide whether and where to register
	the trademark.<P>
	<li> The name and applicable information is recorded in our law firm's
	database.
</ol><P>
<A NAME="regus">	
<h3><font color="C50B21">Registration: United States</font></h3>
	In most instances, our law firm files an application for a trademark
	registration in the United States. There are two types of trademark
	applications for registration: use based and intent-to-use.<P>
	
	<strong>Used-based:</strong> If a trademark already has been in use
	or will be in use shortly, the firm will file a use-based application.<P>
	
	<strong>Intent-to-use:</strong> If a trademark will be used later, the firm
	will file an application for an intent-to-use application. Upon use, 
	rights will go back to the date of filing.<P>
	
<ol>
	<li>To obtain a registration, the business unit will need to supply
	the following:
		<ul>
		<li type=disc> Invoices of first sale shipments to a customer in another state
		or country. If an intrastate sale precedes an interestate or
		international sale, a copy of that invoice should be included
		as well.
		<li type=disc> Six labels or photographs of the mark
		<li type=disc> Product literature
		</ul><P>
	<li>The United States trademark examiner will review the application and
	conduct a search for conflicting trademarks. If the trademark examiner
	has questions, he or she will ask the firm to provide the answers. At
	that point, the firm may need to contact the business unit for information.<P>
	<li>If the trademark examiner accepts the application, the name will be
	published for opposition by the public (the public has amonth to oppose
	the use of the name). however, if the trademark examiner believes that
	the name is "descriptive" or infringes on another's name, he or she
	may reject the application.<P>
	<li>If the name clears the opposition period or clears any resulting
	opposition(s), the registration is allowed and our law firm enters the
	appropriate information into the databses. If we are unsuccessful at
	obtaining a registration, we may have to select a new name.
</ol><P>
<A NAME="mainus">	
<h3><font color="C50B21">Maintenance: United States</font></h3>
<ol>
	<li>The registration is valid for ten years if the trademark remains in
	continuous use for the first five years. Between the fifth and sixth
	year, our law firm contacts the business unit for sales information and
	for specimens of the trademark as it used on or in connection with
	the product.<P>
	<li> If the trademark has been used for five consecutive years and
	the unit plans to continue use of the trademark, our law firm files the
	affidavit with the United States Patent and Trademark Office stating
	that the name has been used in commerce for five consecutive years.<P>
	<li> If the affidavit is accepted, the trademark becomes "incontestable."
	That means it becomes easier to enforce and harder to attack on legal
	grounds.<P>
	<li>A registration may be renewed indefinitely for ten-year period. During
	the tenth year, the trademark registration must be renewed if the business
	unit wants to maintain statutory rights. As with the affidavit, our firm
	asks the business unit whether it has been using the trademark as
	registered, adn whether it plans to continue using the trademark. If so,
	the firm asks the business unit to provide specimens of the trademark
	as it is used in commerce on or in connection with the product.
</ol><P>

<h3><font color="C50B21">Registration: International</font></h3>
	
	The need for international registrations is the decision of the business
	unit. In general, applications are filed in countries with scheduled
	sales activities. Registration requirements differ from country to 
	country. Some countries, such as the United States, base trademark rights
	on use. Other countries base trademark rights on registration; the first
	party to file a registration obtains rights to a trademark. Basic
	registration steps as as follows:<P>
<ol>
	<li>The business unit notifies our law firm of the countries in which
	it wants to register the trademark.<P>
	<li> The firm contacts its associates in the selected countries to
	request filings of trademark applications.<P>
	<li> The associates request necessary information/documents from the firm
	and apply for trademark registration in their respective countries.
	If necessary, the business unit is asked to supply addditional information
	and materials.<P>
	<li> The trademark offices in the respective countries examine the application'
	and search for conflicting names. They also examine the name for descriptiveness.
	If there are conflicts, our application is refused, and depending on the
	countries' law, we or the trademark office may strike an agreement with
	the owner of the conflicting mark.<P>
	<li> In many countries, as in the United States, the name is published for
	public opposition. If the name is opposed, we may strike an agreement with
	the opposing party. If we cannot come to an agreement, we may have to select
	another trademark.<P>
	<li>If the application is found in order and conflicts, if any, are settled,
	registration is allowed.
</ol><P>
<A NAME="mainint">	
<h3><font color="C50B21">Maintenance: International</font></h3>
	
	Maintenance requirements differ from country to country. Basically, each
	registration is good for a period of years -- 5, 7, 10, 14, or 15 years.
	Before a term has lapsed, we are required to <strong> renew </strong>
	the registration for a like term if we wish to renew rights. In some
	countries, such as Spain, we also are required to pay a tax every few
	years to maintain the registration.<P>
	
<ol>
	<li> Each fiscal year the business unit will be sent a list of registrations
	due for renewal.<P>
	<li> The business unit decides whether to renew the regisrations and
	returns its decisions to our trademark law firm.<P>
	<li> If authorized by the business unit, approximately six months before a
	renewal is due, the firm will notify its associate to file a renewal
	application in the country of its renewal.<P>
	<li> Legal notifies the business unit if sales information, invoices, brochures,
	or additional information are required for filing the renewal application
	or for meeting the request of the trademark examiner who reviews the
	renewal application.<P>
	<li> The associate notifies our trademark law firm when a renewal has been
	granted, and the renewal and the date of the next renewal is recorded
	in the firm's trademark database.
