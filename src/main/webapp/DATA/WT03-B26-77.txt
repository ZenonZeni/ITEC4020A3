<H4>5. SCOPE FOR AN EOC WORKING GROUP</H4>
A Working Group is defined as described in the following (edited) excerpt
from the EOC Science Plan:<BR>
<BR>
&quot;An EOC Working Group is the essential initial step in developing generic
Tasks from the applications oriented Threads and is the entry point for
all approved Tasks. The results of the Working Groups form the basis for
priority setting. Working Groups identify and help rank issues and (following
prioritisation) lead to the selected focus activities of the EOC. These
are Science Projects and/or Implementation Teams. Science Projects resolve
the scientific issues and publish results. Implementation Teams may take
the results from the Science Project and implement then (for example) as
software or develop a technology transfer strategy. The outcomes of the
science teams will be formal scientific publications but those of the implementation
teams may not be. For example, Implementation Teams may involve commercial
software houses working with scientists to provide products that are documented,
quality controlled and work correctly.<BR>
<BR>
The Working Groups offer an opportunity for scientists in different Divisions,
the EOC and from other groups to develop collaboration and locate major
centres of expertise and interest. The projects selected will seek the best
teams and be subject to approval in competition with other Working Group
outcomes. The priority setting and approval process for the Science Projects
and Implementation Teams that arise from this activity will be explicit
and include specific identification of deliverables and milestones. While
the EOC has a central location in Canberra where a critical mass of scientists
will tackle generic science issues and algorithm development, locations
of EOC project and implementation activities can also be decided by infrastructure
and core staff locations and be potentially at any location with adequate
research support among CSIRO sites. The key characteristics of EOC projects
are collocation of scientists, efficient use of resources, inter-Divisional
collaboration, support for the goals of the EOC and a generic Earth Observation
Science focus that provides support across different applications and/or
involves a range of tools.<BR>
<BR>
Science Projects and Implementation Teams will be formed according to specific
guide-lines and will be monitored for progress within the EOC structure
and evaluated against criteria defined at the outset of the activity. The
outcomes of an EOC Task will emphasise quality of product and excellence
of production. A primary role of and criterion for EOC activities includes
making the findings accessible and useful to areas of CSIRO and industry
not currently exploiting Earth Observation to its fullest extent.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A Scene Brightness Working Group needs to consider these as guidelines and
develop Science Project(s) and/or Implementation Team(s) to resolve issues
identified. In particular, the WG will need to establish effective data
sets to provide objective tests of the methods and allocate cases where
only empirical models and field measurements are appropriate and those where
measurement models are appropriate to the teams. Standard data sets that
are needed to evaluate the alternative models must be carefully considered
as well the end uses and the means to evaluate methods against the value
of the product.<BR>
<BR>
The best methods could be implemented in software by an implementation team.
During development and testing a standard language such as IDL could be
used for easy exchange. Other than such general statements as these, an
initial meeting is needed to plan actions and delineate the scopes of the
Working Group and expected times until when Project objectives are in place.<BR>
