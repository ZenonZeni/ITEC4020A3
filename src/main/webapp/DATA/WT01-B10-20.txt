<hr></b></h2>


"It seems like everything is on hold until we get a baby," Margaret B. said.<p>
"We did that, too. We put off buying a house, getting a car, changing jobs, taking a vacation . . ."<p>
"So have we," Bryan W. interrupted. "We spend all our extra money on medical bills. We can't do anything else."<p>
"The menstrual cycle takes over your whole life," Steven S. added.<p>
Kathy agreed. "Every time we want to leave for the weekend, I have to go in for ultrasound or Steven has to collect a specimen for AIH. There's no time for making other plans."<p>
Of<p>
"We don't even go to my parents' house anymore," Shelley T. said. "I can't stand all the questions: 'When are you going to give us a grandchild?' Or, 'Why don't you just relax? Let nature take its course.' "<p>
Kathy interrupted. "I don't go to baby showers anymore either. I used to cry for days afterward and I don't need that kind of grief."<p>
"You have the right to avoid painful situations," the <a href="resolve.html">RESOLVE</a> leader agreed. "There's no rule that says you have to force yourselves to face these situations all of the time. you have to plan your own life and be true to your own needs.<p>
"You need to give yourselves permission to move on with your lives. Putting off buying new clothes because you may need a maternity wardrobe instead; delaying your vacation because you might miss a call from the adoption agency; keeping your old job because if you get pregnant you don't want to lose your maternity benefits—it can go on and on. Giving up your other dreams and all the fun in your life only adds to your frustration and anger."<p>
Then Margaret B. spoke: "I'm beginning to understand what you're saying. We aren't just upset about our fertility problem; we're also upset about how our fertility problem is ruining the rest of our lives."<p>
"So if we would try to live like normal people, we would be happier." Richard B. reached for Margaret's hand. "It would do a lot for our marriage, too."<p>
Even when only one partner must be medically treated, I find that the fertility problem affects them both because the <i>couple</i> loses control of their destiny, the <i>couple</i> undergoes fertility treatment, and the<i> couple</i> shares the emotional strain of dealing with friends and family. Infertility does not just affect one person;<i> it affects the couple</i>.<p>
In this chapter I want to help you rethink the attitudes that may be interfering with your self-esteem, your sexuality, and your progress toward pregnancy. You are entitled to have the freedom to be yourself and to consider new options apart from what others expect or demand. I want to put you back in control of your life so that you can deal with your marriage, your family, your friends, and your career. And I'm certain that as a couple you will grow closer and stronger from your efforts.<p><hr>
<h2 align=center>Infertility—a Recycling Life Crisis
</h2>
Coping with a fertility problem is as significant a life crisis as adjusting to the death of a loved one. Because of the ambiguity of the loss, however, couples with fertility problems have difficulty getting over their crisis: there is no body to bury and no clear-cut stopping point. Perhaps it's more like having a loved one missing in action. There's always hope: just one more month of treatment, just one more surgery, maybe next month will be The One. With each attempt the couple develops renewed hope, and with each failure the couple mourns their loss. Then, once again, they muster up enough strength to get back on the emotional crisis roller coaster: they try again, and again, and again.<p>
<b>Riding the Emotional Crisis Roller Coaster</b><br>
<i>Shock and denial</i>. When you learn that you are "infertile" or that your fertility treatment has failed, at first you become numb. you may have difficulty thinking, experience emotional swings and outbursts, and show impaired judgment. You may only be able to function from day to day and not really believe the facts: "This can't be happening to me. I'm not infertile, I just can't get pregnant." "Until now I had a perfectly ordered life; then everything just hit the wall." This period of adjustment may last several weeks or even a couple of months<p>
<i>Searching and learning</i> is a period during which you want to learn everything you can about infertility, so you can make some sense of it. you read everything you can get your hands on and talk to infertile couples every chance you get. you may frequently find yourself becoming angry, restless,<p>
impatient, and indecisive. You begin to feel guilty about what you perceive as past transgressions: an abortion you had as a teenager, an affair that caused PID, or using birth control for so many years. During this time, studies show that you are at greatest risk for developing an illness.<p>
<i>Bargaining and guilt</i> is a stage where you attempt to regain control of your life and do a lot of crying. You may look to God for answers or promise to "be good" if you get pregnant. You may find yourself saying, "What did I do to deserve this?" "Maybe I'm too selfish," "It's your fault," or "Maybe we don't deserve children; our marriage isn't the greatest in the world."<p>
<i>Anger</i> grows from the senselessness and futility of the situation. You become resentful, enraged, and feel helpless. You feel that you've lost control of one of your basic rights. You say, "Why me? All sorts of other people can have babies. I'm a good, wholesome person, so why do I have to suffer?"<p>
<i>Optimism and hope</i> grow as you begin to believe that treatment will help. You work hard at your treatment, but your anger and frustration increase with each failure. You may even start to con yourself: "I'm sure everything will work out," "It doesn't really matter anyway," "I should feel happy— I've got everything else I could want," "Maybe if we adopt, I'll get preg-nant," "Maybe we shouldn't have any children."<p>
<i>Depression</i> descends from your pain, despair, emptiness, and sadness. For many, life loses its meaning and pregnancy becomes an obsession. You try more bargaining: "We'll do anything." Any failure—at workup at school, in bed—is seen as "another example of my inadequacy." You begin to think that you may be going crazy: "I'm trapped in hope; I don't want to hope anymore."<p>
<i>Reorganization</i> follows depression and is characterized by better judg-ment, better eating and sleeping. The obsessive drive is gone; you are healthier; you begin to get your priorities into perspective. You stop fighting what's happening and realize that like it or not, fertility problems are part of your life and need to be dealt with, not denied.<p>
<i>Acceptance and resolution</i> take place when the doctor says, "We've done all we can." Once the pain subsides, you begin to say, "Maybe it would be okay to decide not to have children"; "If I never have a baby, I at least have a husband who loves me. We're going through this together and he's right with me"; "I was courageous to get this far." you begin to laugh and make plans to get on with life unless you have renewed hope—a new treatment, a new doctor, a breakthrough in technology—and then you hop aboard the emo-tional roller coaster for another round.<p>
The time people spend in each stage of emotional crisis varies from one person to another. Their ability to help themselves, to communicate, to handle their thoughts, to manage anger, to adjust to stress, and to resolve conflicts help them move through the stages. People who fail to deal with any one stage of grief get caught—caught in bargaining and guilt, caught in anger, caught in depression. People who learn to deal with each stage, one step at a<p>
time, accept their situation, take control of their lives, and start living again. Many of my patients have done this and you can learn to do it, too.<p>

<b>Recognize the Danger Signs of Excessive Stress</b><br>
Sometimes stress levels build to unreasonable levels. Your coping skills fail and you begin to use inappropriate and ineffective techniques to resolve your problems. If you find yourself resorting frequently to the mechanisms described below, you may want to seek outside counseling or do some quiet thinking and talking with your spouse or close friend about what is happening.<p>
<i>Displacement</i>—redirecting your feelings from the original person or prob-lem to another person or object. For example, when Michelle P. became upset with her mother, she would take it out on her husband. After her husband gently called this to her attention, they worked out a strategy for her to deal more effectively with her mother.<p>
<i>Dependency</i>—letting someone take care of you and make all of your decisions for you so you are free to "opt out" of life. For example, Vicky M. let her husband take care of all the funeral arrangements for their stillborn child. Vicky always regretted that she hadn't picked out the dress their daughter was buried in. she hated her weakness.<p>
<i>Aggression</i>—moving against another person. Dan M. spent all of his time figuring out how to get back at someone instead of figuring out how to level with the person about how he felt. When he learned to say "Ouch!" he found that people really didn't intend to hurt him, they just didn't understand.<p>
<i>Passivity and evasion</i>—seizing power by becoming passive, by avoiding responsibility, or by pouting. John T. used to say, "I don't care—do what you want," when he really didn't feel that way. Then he learned that people would consider his feelings if he shared them. That was the first step John took toward taking control of his life.<p>
<i>Sexual withdrawal</i>—expressing disapproval or anger by withholding sexual favors. Not wanting to make love after an argument is understandable, but using sex to get your way is inappropriate.<p>
You may wish to rate yourself on the checklist below. If you have too many pluses for your own comfort, you may want to seek outside counseling. Often a counselor can quickly relieve your anxiety by helping you get your priorities in order and pinpointing the key elements of a problem so you can deal with each stressful situation one step at a time.<p><hr>
<h2 align=center>Stress Assessment Check List</h2>
Make a copy of this questionnaire or write the statements on a sheet of paper or in a notebook. Then place a plus (+) beside each statement that describes you, a minus ( - ) beside each statement that does not describe you.<p>
<ul>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I've lost interest in almost everything but my fertility treatment.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I don't know what to do with my free time.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I spend all day keeping the house spotless/spend long hours on work so I won't think about not having children.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   People make too many demands on my time.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I don't seem to be able to say no to my doctor or my spouse.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I don't care what I look like anymore. Sometimes I don't keep my BBT chart or take the medicine my doctor ordered.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I never have any time for me; my schedule revolves around my fertility treatment.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Other people' s opinions are more important than mine.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I can't concentrate; all I can think about is getting pregnant.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I don't sleep well; wake up too early; don't feel rested. I feel like my body is my enemy.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I nap in the afternoon or fall asleep early in the evening.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I've lost my sense of humor. Without children in my life there's no room for happiness and fun.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I often cry for what seems like no reason.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Sometimes I just feel numb and emotionless, especially about having sex.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Sometimes I laugh nervously and loud.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I want to be alone most of the time. I can't bear having to explain my infertility to anyone anymore.<br>

<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I often feel resentful and angry, and don't know why.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Sometimes I wish I could start life over so I could avoid the mistakes that led to my fertility problem.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I often ignore things that in the past would have upset me.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   Frequently I'm impatient and irritable. I may even accuse my spouse or doctor of not doing his/her best to help me with my fertility problem.<br>
<img align=top src="blue.gif">   I think about and talk about the past a lot. Without children I don't have much of a future.<br>
</ul><hr>
<h2 align=center>Getting Control of Your Life</h2>
<b>Be Your Own Best Friend</b><br>
Can you look in the mirror, smile, and say, "You are really something special !" ? If you cannot, it's probably because you reevaluate yourself every time someone else disapproves of you or something you've done. <i>Don't let other people knock you off balance</i> by suggesting a different doctor or a new treatment. Their opinion or point of view is not any more valid than your own. you need to learn to look at yourself, and life, through your <i>own eyes</i>. With your experience and knowledge you know far more about fertility treatment than most people. You know where you're going and how you're going to get there. Accept yourself as a "package deal"—overall, you are okay.<p>
<b>Look Ahead</b><br>
You need to break the habit of living life laced with guilt, always saying things like, "I should have changed doctors two years ago," "If only I had tried to get pregnant ten years ago," or, "What if I had not used an IUD?" Separate your past from your future and move ahead. Allow yourself to change your mind. Give yourself permission to act instead of looking to others for permission and approval. Don't feel as though you have to justify your decisions. Manage your own life. Enjoy yourself and laugh a lot!<p>
<b>Be Assertive, Not Aggressive</b><br>
Assertiveness is the key to effective communication. By becoming assert-ive, you can avoid internalizing your anger and frustration. When you communicate your feelings honestly—your disappointment, your pain, your frustration—you help others understand you so they can meet your needs. If they are not concerned about your needs, perhaps you should reconsider the relationship.<p>
You can find out how assertive you are with the following checklist. Try to be as honest with yourself as you can. Your first impression is probably the truest answer.<p>
<h2>Assertiveness Checklist</h2>

</ul><hr>
If your checklist is full of pluses, you don't have a problem with assertiveness. If you have more minuses than you think you should, here are a few suggestions for improving your score:<p>
<b><i>Plan Some New Responses to Old Problems</i></b><br>
Keep track of your assertiveness by reviewing your responses in specific situations. For example, remember the last time someone's insensitivity made you angry? Perhaps someone said something like, "I don't know why having a baby is so important to you. There are other things in the world besides having babies." If you became angry but didn't express it, withdrew from the situation, or found yourself wanting to leave, consider this: Were you upset because of what the other person said or because you were not able to respond? Not willing to stand up for your ideas or your opinions? Many times we are more angry with ourselves for letting others control our emotions than we are because the other person didn't understand us. If you withdraw from the situation instead of asserting yourself, you will probably kick yourself all the way home—and the next day, too.<p>
Imagine handling the situation assertively. What should you have said? Should you have called him a name? Should you have tried to explain your needs? Should you never invite that person to your house again? What are the consequences of these actions? Can you live with them?<p>
If you need some help in deciding what to do, ask someone. Perhaps watching a role model will give you some ideas. Support groups like <a href="resolve.html">RESOLVE</a> are especially good at showing you how other couples have dealt with stressful situations. Set a realistic goal for the next encounter. Try it out. See what happens. If necessary, modify your approach and try it again. How do you feel? Stick with it.<p>
<b>Keep Communication Open and Honest</b><br>
Have you ever felt that other people don't understand you, that when you try to talk to them they don't listen? It's hard enough to talk about your fertility problems and the effects they have on your life, let alone trying to get through someone else's thick head at the same time. There are a few principles of good communication which might give you an edge:<p>
<ol>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Communicate to be heard, not to win.<p>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">    Inform; don't try to teach.<p>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Make requests, not demands.<p>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Ask for what you need; don't expect others to read your mind.<p>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">    Go for compromise, not perfection.<p>
</ol>
These principles make a lot of sense, but putting them into practice is another matter altogether. Think about different ways you could say the same thing.<p>

<b>Winning:</b><br><dd> <i>"I won't go to your sister's baby shower."</i><br>
<b>Communicating:</b><br><dd><i> "When I go to baby showers, I feel awful."</i><p>

<b>Teaching:</b><br><dd><i> "People need funerals to mourn their loss."</i><br>
<b>Informing:</b><br><dd><i> "I really need my family with me right now, to help me say good-bye to our baby."</i><p>

<b>Demanding:</b><br><dd><i> "I need next Wednesday off. I have a doctor's appointment to take some tests."</i><br>
<b>Requesting:</b><br><dd><i> "I need to take some tests at my doctor's next Wednesday. Do you see any problem with my taking a couple of hours off? I can make up the time by coming in early Monday and Tuesday."</i><p>
<b>Waiting for telepathy:</b><br><dd><i> "You know why I'm mad!"</i><br>
<b>Asking for what you need:</b><br><dd><i> "Mom, please don't ask me after every appointment what the doctor said. If anything happens, I'll let you know."</i><p>

<b>Insisting on perfection: </b><br><dd><i>"You ought to understand what I mean! After all, you're a college graduate!</i>"<br>
<b>Going for the compromise:</b><br><dd> <i>"Would you try to understand? I think it would help us get along better."</i><p>

I know some of these statements sound familiar to you. As I was writing them, I recalled a few situations I could have handled better, too. Try to remember that you and your mate are a team; you're both on the same side. Maybe you go about reaching your goals differently, and maybe your priorities are not exactly the same, but you aren't enemies, and you aren't plotting to do the other one in. When disagreements flare, try to put yourself in the other person's place, and remember; principles are rarely more important than people. If you seem to have reached an impasse, you may wish to consult with a trusted friend, counselor, or member of the clergy. Perhaps they will be able to help you get a different perspective.<p>
If you level with family members, friends, and your boss about your <i>feelings</i>, instead of lecturing them or hoping they'll read your mind, they will be more likely to understand you and respect your decisions.<p>
Remember that a series of small earth tremors relieves tension and pres-sure within the fault and often prevents a major earthquake. Likewise, if you handle each situation as it arises, you can relieve stress and tension in your relationships and perhaps prevent a major upheaval.<p>
<b>Techniques for Handling Your Thoughts</b><br>

Many people who survive serious accidents, undergo major surgery, or narrowly escape death relive the events as though they had a videotape in their brain. Reviewing the details of tragic events is a normal mechanism for dealing with stress and grief. We use this process to desensitize ourselves and to come to terms with what happened. However, when our thoughts take over our lives, as they did Debbie W's., when they prevent us from moving ahead, we must yell "Stop!" out loud and shift to pleasant thoughts.<p>
"When the RESOLVE group told me to stop ruminating over my lost baby by yelling 'Stop,' I thought people would think I was crazy," Debbie W. said. "But it worked. I finally convinced myself to live for the future instead of burying myself in the tragedy of my past. Now, instead of planning my baby's funeral, I'm decorating the nursery."<p>
<b>Prepare for Stressful Situations</b><br>
You need to prepare yourself for stressful situations, even rehearse and practice for them. First, say to yourself:<p>
<ol>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   I am important.<br>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   My opinions count.<br>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   I have the right to say what I feel.<br>
</ol>
When the conflict begins, convince yourself to take the action you know is needed. Believe that what you want is important.<p>
"I used to dread going to Sunday dinner at Mom's. My brother and his children always came and there was never a Sunday that someone didn't say, 'When are you going to give us a grandchild?' It had gotten to the point that my wife and I didn't want to see them again. But the RESOLVE group convinced me that my folks just didn't know they were hurting me and that I needed to level with them."<p>
"I practiced what I wanted to say to them every day for a week, over and over, until I could say those words in my sleep: Mom, Dad, no one wants to give you a grandchild any more than Jan and I do. But right now we can't. We're doing everything we can to solve our problem. I know you don't mean to hurt us, but asking us when we're going to give you a grandchild only makes us feel like failures. We'd both appreciate your not saying any more about it."<p>
"You can't imagine how hard it was to tell my mom and dad that. But you know, they were really sorry. They had no idea they were hurting us. My dad apologized and Mom gave Jan a big hug. Now we look forward to spending Sunday with the folks."<p>
<b>How to Control Your Anger</b><br>

Anger is a natural, healthy, non-evil emotion. Go ahead and get angry! Get it off your chest! But next time, why don't you lay some plans that will avoid an angry confrontation.<p>
If you become angry, it's probably because you've given someone else the power to control you and your emotions. Remember, <i>you</i> are responsible for your feelings; others don't <i>make</i> you angry. How many times have you become angry when someone said:<p>
"One of these days you'll pop up pregnant."<p>
As someone puts her newborn in your arms: "You're going to have one of these someday."<p>
"Isn't it about time for you to have children?"<p>
"You'll just have to accept things."<p>
"I don't understand why you do that to your body, just to have a baby. It isn't worth it."<p>
Get to know yourself. Know what triggers your anger, what pushes your anger button. And don't set yourself up to get angry. Instead, plan some alternatives for these situations. If you know, for example, that holding a newborn baby drives you up the wall, be ready to say, "Oh, I'd better not hold her. I think I'm coming down with a cold." Or if you become uncomfort-able at a dinner party, when someone you barely know asks you how many children you have, brush it off by saying, "We aren't quite ready to start our family yet."<p>
You must remember that most people don't intend to cause you discom-fort. And often they really aren't extremely interested in your answer; they're just making small talk. It's usually only because you are <i>listening defensively</i> that what they say gets to you. Getting angry is <i>your </i>problem, not theirs.<p>
If someone repeatedly bothers you, a relative, for example, then you need to assert yourself and say, "Mother, you know it's unlikely that we're going to 'pop up pregnant' someday. You aren't cheering me up, you're making me feel worse. I'd appreciate your not saying things like that." Or, "We aren't ready to 'accept things.' As long as our doctor has hope, we aren't giving up. When you say things like that, I feel angry. I'd appreciate changing the subject."<p>
Remember:<p>
<ol>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Stick to specifics and to the present situation.<br>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Avoid generalizing and reviewing the entire history of your relationship.<br>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Deal with issues as they arise, when you feel your anger building.<br>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Work toward a resolution, not a victory.<p></ol>

Be honest with people, share your feelings with them, and don't put them on the defensive by making accusations. If they really care about you, they will do their best to help.<p>
<b>Learn to Fight Fair</b><br>
It's okay to fight if you fight fair. Fair fights release tension and often lead to the resolution of problems. Unfair fights, though, create more tension and do not solve anything. To fight fair, you need to follow these rules:<p>
<ol>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Do not tell your mate what he or she is thinking: "You don't really want this baby!" Instead, say how <i>you</i> are feeling: "Sometimes I'm not sure that you want this baby."<p>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Do not reach into the past for insults and injustices: "If you'd taken a semen analysis in the beginning, we'd be a year ahead of where we are now!" Instead, stick to the present: "Let's make an appointment to see the urologist."<p>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Do not resort to name-calling: "Your mother is a bitch !" Instead, look for solutions: "I believe it would be best for me to avoid long visits with you mother."<p>
<img align=top src ="red.gif">   Avoid a win/lose position: "I'm not changing my mind." Instead, seek understanding: "I feel very strongly about my position. I don't believe I can change my mind."<p></ol><hr>
<b>
<h2 align=center>When Is It Time to Quit</h2>
I wish I could give you a magic answer to this question: call a halt after two years, after in vitro, after adoption. But it's not that simple. There is no concrete answer that works for everyone.<p>
Some people decide to take a breather from the rigors of fertility treatment: to stop taking their temperature, to stop taking medication, to stop worrying about whether they'll get pregnant this month. In fact, many even use birth control to prevent a pregnancy. After they've had some time to relax and to enjoy life, or after hearing of a new breakthrough in fertility treatment, they may once again renew their treatment efforts.<p>
Other people want to make a final decision: they have a hysterectomy; they stop treatment and apply for adoption; they have their tubes tied. They want to get off the roller coaster forever and get on with their lives.<p>
The best time to quit is when <i>you</i> decide to—not when you run out of money, not when others say it's all right, not when you've tried every possible treatment, not when you've hit bottom, but when you decide you want to quit.<p>
As a couple, you must decide what "happy ending" will meet your needs. Will you be satisfied to remain childless? Will an adopted child meet your parenting needs? Will AID meet your needs? Will a surrogate mother meet your needs? Is an embryo transfer the answer? How much money are you comfortable spending? How much time will you devote to solving your fertility problem? Only when you've answered these questions <i>to your satisfaction </i>will you be able to move on with your life.<p><hr>
<h2 align=center>Two Special People</h2>

"What do you do when your spirits get low?" Shelley T. asked.<p>
"Well, a good cry helps a lot!" Kathy S. smiled. "I've even been known to slam every door in the house!"<p>
The group laughed.<p>
"I appreciate the little things Bryan does to cheer me up," Debbie W. added. "After my second miscarriage he brought me breakfast in bed for a week. And every once in a while, for no special reason, he'll bring me a red rose."<p>
"When we really get down, we splurge on something," Michael T. said. "It seems like we give up everything to pay for our fertility treatment. So even though we're careful to watch our budget, once in a while we do something specialgo out to eat, go skiing, buy a new camera."<p>
"Taking my temperature every morning used to get me down," Kathy said. "I hated to tell Steven, 'Today's the day.' It really helped when Steven started recording my temperature for me. Sharing the responsibility and making him aware of my fertile days took a lot of pressure off both of us."<p>
"Let's face it, the stress we're under really strains our sexual desires and Performance," Shelley said. "We really have trouble before a postcoital test."<p>
"Ever since I realized I had a fertility problem, I haven't been able to enjoy sex—even during my so-called infertile days," Margaret B. said. "I've always been haunted by a lingering hope: maybe this time will be the time that works."<p>
"Me, too," Kathy said. "But Steven always refuses to let our infertility get us down. I don't know what I would do without his positive attitude. Just when I'm at my lowest, he'll say, 'We're not going to let this thing stop our life.' "<p>
Shelley said: "A couple I know sometimes uses birth control so they can enjoy sex. Because they know they can't get pregnant, neither of them feels that they must perform, and when her period starts, they don't feel they failed that month."<p>
"It seems to me that infertility disturbs women more than it does men," Kathy said.<p>
"At least we seem to show it more," Margaret said.<p>
"I don't know about that," Shelley countered. "One time I thought Michael was going off the deep end. I didn't know what to do, so I called a RESOLVE member for help. she suggested that Michael talk to a RESOLVE husband having a similar fertility problem."<p>
"Talking to Jerry was the best thing I ever did," Michael said.<p>
"You know, that's really the key," Kathy said. "Having someone who will listen to you.<p>
"Keeping our marriage together and learning again how to enjoy our sexuality hasn't been easy," Kathy added. "We've had to work hard at it, over many months." She reached for Steven's hand. "But it's been worth it." She smiled. "I don't mean to sound conceited, but I believe we have a stronger marriage than most of our friends, who have not gone through what we've had to."<p><hr>
<h2 align=center>You Have the Power to Change</h2>

Like these couples, you have the power to change your life. Change is hard work; it usually comes in small steps; not all at once. Always keep in mind that you can change only yourself and those things under your control, not others.<p>
When you approach life assertively, fight fair, express your needs, accept responsibility for your feelings, and act openly and honestly—with yourself<p>
and with others—you will see the world through a new light. Armed with this knowledge and understanding about fertility treatment, you will be in control of your life and your future.<p>
Keep your spirits up and know that you can do it. you are working with an infinitely valuable resource—<i>yourself</i>.<p><hr>
