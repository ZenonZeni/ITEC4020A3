Name:  <B>DAVIDOFF OF GENEVA</B><BR>
Address:  535 Madison Avenue (between 53rd and 54th Streets), New York, NY 10022<BR>
Tel:  (212) 751-9060, (800) 328-4365<BR>
Proprietor:  Diana Wagner, manager<BR>
Years Operating:  10<BR>
# of Brands:  50<BR>
Hours:  Mon.-Wed., Fri., 9:30-6:30; Thu. 10-7:30; Sat., 10-6.<BR>
Special Features:  This self-touted "men's specialty shop" is pure Madison Avenue.  Though the walk-in humidor is often depressingly bare of Davidoff's own cigars, the store itself is a treat.  High-ceilinged and heavy on the chrome and polished glass, the store may lack warmth, but the cheery sales staff more than make up for it.  In the Christmas season, come early unless you don't mind waiting on a slushy city sidewalk.  And bring your credit cards.  After all, when you pay for the name, nothing comes cheap.<BR><BR CLEAR>

Name:  <B>MOM'S CIGARS</B><BR>
Address:  172 Fifth Avenue (corner of 22nd Street and 5th Avenue), New York, NY 10010<BR>
Tel:  (212) 243-1943, (800) 831-8893<BR>
Proprietor:  Mark and Alex Goldman<BR>
Years Operating:  45<BR>
# of Brands:  200+<BR>
Hours:  Mon.-Fri., 6:30-5:30<BR>
Special Features:  The only shop in the City where the wooden Indians are for sale (as are the wooden cowboys, cowgirls, sailors, etc.).  The kind of place your grandfather haunted in his day.  A long, dingy shop, complete with a candy counter and classic "trading-store" barrels full of cheapie items.  There are no more 10 cent cigars to be had, here or anywhere, but this is as close as you'll get.  Mom's also stocks a selection of their own cigars, but don't expect to be pampered while you choose.  The attitude here is quintessential New York:  curt, forthright, no hi-jinks.  In New York we call it typical.  Elsewhere they might call it "rude."
