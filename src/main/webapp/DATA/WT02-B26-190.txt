<B>BACKGROUND</B>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, Argonne National Laboratory has demonstrated a successful track record in completing large and complex programs to solve difficult environmental issues over a wide range of circumstances.  The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems (CERS), operating within Argonne's Energy Systems Division, performs research, development, and demonstration programs to attain all aspects of environmental restoration from start to finish, including site characterization, selection and implementation of remediation technologies for site cleanup, and final restoration of a site to usefulness.
<P>
The ultimate goal of the Center is to put the research results into practice.  Sponsors and industry users who have already benefitted from the Center's knowledge and technologies include the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), Gas Research Institute (GRI), and the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).  For instance, Center staff tackled research problems associated with the coal mining industry, funded by the DOE in the 1970s; pipeline right-of-way research, sponsored by GRI from 1982 to present; and rehabilitation of training areas and hazardous waste sites for the U.S. Army from 1983 to today.
<P>
<P>
<B>MISSION AND GOALS</B>
<P>
The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems' mission is to develop and perform research, development, and demonstration programs to support the complete environmental restoration process, from start to finish, addressing each of the three stages of the process, and to transfer the knowledge and technologies obtained to sponsors and other potential users of that information.
<P>
The following five goals constitute the Center's mission:
<UL>
<LI>Research, develop, evaluate, and demonstrate innovative and improved methods, techniques, and technologies to characterize all aspects of highly disturbed and/or contaminated facilities, sites, ecosystems, and landscapes.</LI>
<LI>Design and implement laboratory and field research programs to develop, evaluate, and/or demonstrate improved and more effective or 			efficient methods, systems, or technologies to clean up or remediate hazardous and/or toxic materials within the environment.</LI>
<LI>Research, develop, demonstrate, and implement improved and effective methods and technologies to reclaim, remediate, or restore to a sustainable and intended end use disturbed sites resulting from site remediation activities, production and transportation of energy and/or energy and mineral resources, military activities, or other causes.</LI>
<LI>Determine, evaluate, or predict the environmental effects and/or consequences of past, ongoing, or planned military activities; energy production, development, or transportation projects; or other similar or related actions; and identify, 	develop, test, and/or demonstrate under laboratory and field conditions promising techniques or technologies with which to mitigate consequent, deleterious environmental impacts.</LI>
<LI>Develop, demonstrate, implement, and maintain state-of-the-art scientific, engineering, and technical knowledge, skills, tools, capabilities, and resources necessary to perform or to support all research, development, and demonstration 	activities supporting the Center's mission and goals.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<B>AVAILABLE RESOURCES</B>
<P>
The Center's mission is accomplished by using the diverse staff resources available within the Center, in collaboration with other individuals, programs, and organizations within Argonne's Energy Systems Division, the Laboratory, other R&D organizations, academia, or the private sector.  Approximately 100 skilled scientists and engineers staff the Center.  To further leverage its resources, the staff partners with more than 400 other technical experts active in the environmental arena throughout the Laboratory.
<P>
The CERS staff encompasses a wide range of expertise and disciplines, including engineering; hydrology; geology, geophysics, and geochemistry; soil science and agronomy; aquatic and terrestrial ecology; organic, inorganic, and analytical chemistry; and social sciences, policy, and legal experts.
<P>
When addressing an environmental challenge, the Center's staff takes a multidisciplinary team approach, tailored specifically to the needs of the problem.  The teams focus on arriving at practical, cost-effective engineering, scientific, and technical solutions to resolve environmental issues in a timely manner.
<P>
<P>
<B>TEAMWORK</B>
<P>
Five teams operate within the Center: 
<UL>
<LI>Environmental Chemistry,
<LI>Ecology and Natural Resources,
<LI>Geosciences,
<LI>Engineering and Technology Evaluation, and
<LI>Land Reclamation.
</UL>
<P>
Fundamental team objectives include collaboration and mutual support of existing projects and in developing new programs.  Considerable cooperation and interchange between teams occurs to meet individual project, program, and Center research and development goals, objectives, and needs.
<P>
The <B>Environmental Chemistry Team</B> studies the fate of chemical pollutants in the environment.  To do this, several different chemistry disciplines are involved, including analytical, physical, inorganic, and organic chemistry, as well as biochemistry.  The <B>Ecology and Natural Resources Team </B> evaluates the impact of human activities on natural biological systems.  Team members have been involved in research projects located throughout North America and in some foreign countries.  The <B>Geosciences Team</B> supports shallow subsurface studies at federal, state, and private facilities in the United States and overseas.  Studies are undertaken to define the geological framework, hydrostratigraphy, and extent of contamination in both terrestrial and near-shore environments.  
<P>
The <B>Engineering and Technology Evaluation Team </B>evaluates treatment technologies under both laboratory and field scales and conditions.  Team members have performed projects at major military facilities contaminated with a range of toxic and hazardous materials.  This team is developing strong expertise in the safe and effective decontamination and demolition of engineered structures and facilities that are suspected of being contaminated.  Finally, the <B>Land Reclamation Team</B> develops innovative techniques and approaches to restore highly disturbed sites and landscapes to productive use.  Members of this team have successfully restored large ares severely degraded by such activities as surface mining, large-scale construction operations, and major military maneuvers and training exercises.
<P>
<P>
<B>LABORATORIES / EQUIPMENT</B>
<P>
Specialized field equipment includes a soil exploration drilling rig, a complete array of geophysical equipment, a mobile laboratory with gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer, and three 4WD field vehicles.
<P>
The Center houses several specialized laboratories: 
<UL>
<LI>Environmental Analysis/Laboratory,
<LI>Chemical Research and Technology Evaluation Laboratories,</LI>
<LI>Land Resources Analysis Laboratory, and
<LI>Field Analytical Laboratory.
</UL>
<P>
The <B>Environmental Analysis/Laboratory</B> has served the analytical needs of ES Division research since 1985 by providing physical and chemical analysis of soil, water, and plant material.  All sample preparations necessary before analysis are performed in the lab before any analytical work is initiated.
<P>
The Center possesses two chemistry laboratories: the <B>Technology Evaluation Laboratory</B> and the <B>Environmental Research Laboratory</B>.  The Technology Evaluation Laboratory is set up for bench-scale studies (such as solvent washing and thermal desorption).  The Environmental Research Laboratory contains a gas chromatograph and a liquid chromatograph.  Two field-ready instruments are also available: a gas chromatograph can be set up in a mobile laboratory for the remote sampling of sites, and a spectrophotometer is also available for screening purposes.
<P>
The <B>Land Resources Analysis Laboratory</B> staff uses a multidisciplinary approach to solve complex environmental and natural resources problems.  Using state-of-the-art geographic information systems, remote sensing, visual simulation, data visualization techniques, global positioning systems, and environmental modeling, the staff conducts applied research on a wide range of physical, biological, and natural resource issues.  These issues include such topics as land reclamation; natural resources and ecosystem management; site characterization; and long-term environmental management, monitoring, and mitigation strategies.
<P>
Greenhouse and plant growth facilities are particularly well suited for a variety of plant research studies.  Two recently renovated greenhouses, totaling 1,200 square feet under glass, have an attached headhouse and laboratory.  Environmental conditions in each greenhouse can be independently controlled and monitored via a central computerized control system.  Other plant research facilities include state-of-the-art hydroponic and aeroponic plant growth systems, controlled environment plant growth chambers, and space for field plots or outdoor growth facilities adjacent to the greenhouse complex.
<P>
<P>
<B>KEY CENTER RESEARCH</B>
<P>
The Center for Environmental Restoration Systems addresses diverse - and often complex - environmental problems.  Key projects are organized into five areas:  Site Restoration, Technology Evaluations, Treatability Testing, and Demonstrations,  Site Characterization,  Information Systems,  and Process and Method Development.
