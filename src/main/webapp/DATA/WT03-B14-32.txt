<P>
Rosenberg's objective is to consistently outperform each client's
designated benchmark and to control risk relative to that benchmark.
We do not earn the extraordinary return, or &quot;alpha,&quot;
by timing the market or by &quot;betting&quot; on factors, such
as size, beta, industry, growth, which contribute too much risk
per unit of return. Our portfolios are fully invested and have
the same exposure to these factors as the benchmark. We add value
at the portfolio level through our stock selection process, and
diversify investment risk across the several hundred holdings
in our portfolios. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Philosophy"><IMG SRC="IMG00050.GIF"><B><FONT SIZE=4>
</P></FONT></B></A>
<P>
At heart, we are fundamental investors. We believe that stock
prices imperfectly reflect the present value of the expected future
earnings of companies, their &quot;fundamental value&quot;. Since
market prices will converge towards fundamental value over time,
we believe that any investor who can accurately determine fundamental
value, and who applies a disciplined investment process to select
those stocks that are currently misvalued, will outperform the
market over time. </P>
<P>
The premise of our investment philosophy is that there is a link
between the price of a stock and the underlying financial characteristics
of the company. In other words, the price reflects the market's
assessment of how well the company is positioned to generate future
earnings and/or future cash flow. We identify and purchase those
stocks which are slightly misvalued -- they are cheaper than similar
stocks with the same financial characteristics. We are confident
that the market will recognize the &quot;better value&quot; and
move to correct the mispricing by purchasing the stocks in our
portfolio. Common sense suggests that this relationship between
price and fundamentals will persist and our strategy will be successful
into the future. </P>
<P>
Our determination of the &quot;average&quot; valuation for a stock
is based upon a comparison of similar companies. We know that
in any group of similar companies, there are always some that
are overvalued, some that are undervalued, and some that are fairly-valued
relative to the average valuation for the group. These moderate
valuation errors are present in every sector of the market and
can be identified through rigorous quantitative analysis of fundamental
data. </P>
<P>
In determining whether or not a stock is fairly priced, our system
considers each company's current valuation, its future earnings,
and investor sentiment toward the stock. We identify an undervalued
stock, hold it in the portfolio until the market recognizes and
corrects for the misvaluation, then sell the stock at a significant
premium to its purchase price. A simplified example of this would
be purchasing a stock which is 10 percent cheaper than similar
stocks and holding it until the market corrects the relative misvaluation
to within 3 percent. Our portfolios are composed of undervalued
stocks from every sector represented in the client's benchmark,
with a typical portfolio consisting of several hundred stocks.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Decision"><IMG SRC="IMG00051.GIF"></P></A>
<P>
Rosenberg's decision process is a continuum. Our research function
analyzes the 15,000 securities in our global universe, both fundamentally
and technically, and determines the risk characteristics of the
client's benchmark. Our portfolio management function optimizes
portfolio composition, executes trades, and monitors performance
and trading costs. </P>
<P>
Factors crucial to the success of our approach include: (1) accurate
and timely data on a large universe of companies; (2) subtle quantitative
descriptors of value and predictors of changes in value; (3) insightful
definitions of similar businesses. The essence of our approach
is rigorous attention to all aspects of the investment process,
from stock selection to portfolio construction, to trading. We
take great care assimilating, checking and structuring the input
data on which our models rely. We are confident that if the data
are correct, the recommendations made by our system will be sound.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Stock"><B><FONT SIZE=4> <IMG SRC="IMG00052.GIF"></P></FONT></B></A>
<P>
Fundamental valuation of stocks is key to our investment process,
and the heart of our valuation process lies in the Appraisal Model.
Analysis of companies in the United States and Canada is conducted
in a single unified model. The model discriminates where the two
markets are substantially different, while simultaneously comparing
companies in the two markets according to their degrees of similarity.
European companies and Asian companies (other than Japanese) are
analyzed in a nearly global model, which includes the United States
and Canada as a further basis for comparative valuation but which
excludes Japan. Japanese companies are analyzed in an independent
national model. </P>
<P>
An important feature of the appraisal model is the classification
of companies into any of 166 groups of &quot;similar&quot; businesses.
We decompose each company into its individual business segments,
and compare each segment with similar business operations of other
companies operating both within national markets and across markets.
Subject to the availability of data within national markets, we
appraise the company's assets, operating earnings, and sales within
each business segment, accepting the market's valuation of that
category of business as fair. We then integrate the segment appraisals
into three valuation models for the total company: balance sheet,
income statement, and sales and simultaneously adjust the segment
appraisals to include appraisals for variables which are declared
only for the total company, such as taxes, capital structure,
and pension funding. The result is a single valuation for each
of the 15,000 companies we follow. </P>
<P>
The difference between Rosenberg's valuation and the market price
reflects an opportunity for profit. We develop &quot;appraisal
alphas&quot;--the expected rate of extraordinary return--by adjusting
for the rate at which the market has corrected for such misvaluations
in the past. </P>
<P>
A second sphere of analysis is captured by our proprietary Earnings
Change Model, which analyzes more than 20 explanatory variables
to predict individual company earnings over a one year horizon.
The variables are fundamental and fall into three categories:
measures of past profitability, measures of company operations
and consensus earnings forecasts. The earnings change model is
independent of the appraisal model and projects the change in
a company's earnings in cents/current price. The value of the
projected earnings change is converted to an &quot;earnings change
alpha&quot; by multiplying the projected change by the market's
historical response to changes of that magnitude. </P>
<P>
Finally, Rosenberg's Investor Sentiment Model quantifies investor
sentiment about features of stocks which influence price but which
are not captured by the appraisal model or the earnings change
model. We identify high quality companies by looking at past price
patterns and by predicting the probability of deficient earnings.
Our models also capture market enthusiasm towards individual stocks
by looking at broker recommendations and analyst estimates.</P>
<P>
Each company's earnings change alpha and investor sentiment alpha
is added to its appraisal alpha to arrive at a total company alpha.
Stocks with large positive total company alphas are candidates
for purchase. Stocks held in a portfolio with total company alphas
that are only slightly positive, zero or negative in ranking are
candidates for sale. </P>
<P>
Before trading, we systematically analyze the short-term price
behavior of individual stocks to determine the timing of trades.
Our model quantifies investor enthusiasm for each stock by analyzing
its short-term performance relative to similar stocks as well
as changes in analyst and broker opinions about the stock, and
earnings surprises. We develop &quot;trading alphas&quot; - the
expected short-term extraordinary return - which enables us to
purchase stocks from supply and to sell stocks into demand, greatly
reducing trading costs. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Optim"><IMG SRC="IMG00053.GIF"><B><FONT SIZE=4> </P></FONT></B></A>
<P>
The portfolio optimization system optimizes the trade-off between
risk and reward relative to the client's benchmark. It exploits
the information developed by the stock selection models to maximize
active return, while eliminating unnecessary active risk. Within
each of the following zones, the optimizer recommends positions
in companies which in aggregate constitute the most efficient
portfolio: the United States, Canada, Europe, Pacific Basin, and
Japan. The optimizer simultaneously considers fundamental alphas,
trading alphas, and risk and quantifies the &quot;net benefit&quot;
to the portfolio of each recommended transaction. A stock is considered
for sale when a higher alpha stock with complementary risk characteristics
has been identified. No transaction will be executed unless the
opportunity offered by the purchase candidate sufficiently exceeds
the potential of an existing holding to justify the transaction
costs. In most markets, portfolios are reoptimized continuously
throughout the day, allowing us to respond immediately to investment
opportunities. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Trading"><IMG SRC="IMG00054.GIF"></P></A>
<P>
Our trading system aggregates the recommended transactions from
the individual portfolios and determines the feasibility of each
recommendation in light of the stock's liquidity, the expected
transaction costs, and general market conditions. It relays target
price information to our trader for each stock considered for
purchase or sale. All transactions are executed within the price
range determined by the trading system. As portfolios are reoptimized
throughout the day, new targets are set which reflect relative
changes in the valuations of our holdings. We continuously monitor
trading costs to determine the impact of commissions and price
disturbance on our portfolios. </P>
<P>
In the U.S., trades are executed through any one of four trading
strategies: traditional brokerage, networks, accommodation, and
package or &quot;basket&quot; trades. The network arrangements
we have developed with Instinet, POSIT, and other institutional
investors facilitate large volume trading with little or no price
disturbance and low commission rates. Accommodative trading (which
we also refer to as our &quot;match system&quot;) allows institutional
buyers and sellers of stock to electronically present us with
their &quot;interest&quot; lists each morning. Any matches between
the inventory which the brokers have presented and our own recommended
trades are signaled to our traders. Since the broker is doing
agency business and has a client on the other side of the trade,
we expect that he will be accommodative in the price. Our objective
in using this match system is to execute most trades on our side
of the bid/ask spread so as to minimize market impact. </P>
<P>
In Europe, the method of trading depends partially on the market
on which we trade. On the European continent, we typically trade
on the exchange, giving orders to brokers for execution either
on an electric exchange (France, Germany, Spain), via open cry
(Switzerland, the Netherlands), or via auction (Italy). We occasionally
deal directly with market makers who effect trades on the ISE
for United Kingdom stocks and on the SEAQ for European securities.</P>
<P>
The high fixed commission schedule in Tokyo combines with the
30 basis point transfer tax on sales to create a costly trading
environment. At the same time, because there are not many market
makers, opportunities exist to improve market impact through careful
timing of trades. </P>
<P>
In general, our approach in Japan relies on limit orders: we prefer
a patient approach to trading, waiting for the other side of the
market to come to our limit. We place limit orders at the opening
auction and selectively place limit orders throughout the day.
In some cases, we use the expertise of the broker to help us with
the timing and structure of these orders. We also use working
orders when trading urgently, especially when investing an initial
cash flow. </P>
