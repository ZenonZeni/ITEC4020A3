<H1>Climate change scenarios:<BR>
The possible cultural and psychological 
impacts</H1>
<HR>
<B>Climate change would impact different cultures in different ways.</B> The sky 
and the weather do not have the same importance in all cultures. In Judeo-Christian 
cultures, the sky is strongly associated with the divine and with all-powerful and infinite 
cosmic powers. Animist and Hindu cultures, on the other hand, tend to associate their 
deities with creatures of the earth. These religious differences might make some cultures 
more sensitive than others to ‘changes in the skies’.<P>
<B>Changes in the climate would tend to affect "traditional" and rural cultures 
more than modern urban societies.</B> While all cultures associate the climate with the 
cyclical nature of life on earth, as expressed in the changing of the seasons, some are 
closer than others to these cycles. Industrialized cultures tend to be guided by a more 
linear concept of time, and they emphasize the concepts of ‘progress’ and permanent 
change. Because they are already used to rapid change, they might even interpret climate 
change as yet another phenomenon to adapt to or to cope with, comparable to 
unemployment or the information-technology revolution. On the other hand, cultural 
values may change as people in industrialized countries become more aware of planet 
Earth as a single system, a fragile biosphere upon which all of humanity depends. <P>
<B>Erratic weather, droughts, and other phenomena of climate change would 
probably affect the psyches of individuals.</B> In addition to the physical and 
economic stresses caused by climate change, societies and institutions may also have to 
cope with the psychological problems of individuals. Research into such problems has 
been done in the context of the threat of nuclear war in industrialized Western societies.1 
Individuals from different cultures, however, are likely to be affected in different ways. In 
Western, individualistic societies, people are likely to experience a growing sense of the 
individual’s fragility and dependence. As they become more aware of humanity’s 
dependence upon the biosphere and of the barriers to effective global action, they may 
suffer a growing feeling of powerlessness. This feeling of powerless dependence may have 
already been prompted by such issues as radioactive pollution and depletion of the ozone 
layer.<P>
<B>The psychological stress of climate change may lead to dysfunctional 
responses.</B> When people experience a widespread problem that they feel unable to do 
anything about, they often develop some sort of psychological defense. A problem as 
overwhelming as climate change is likely to generate such counter-productive responses as 
cynicism, denial, and aggression. When people respond to a desperate situation by 
becoming cynical, they lose their interest in the problem and withdraw from activities that 
might help to alleviate or solve it. When they deny that the problem exists, they deny 
having any responsibility for causing it; as a result, campaigns that, for example, 
encourage people to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by driving their cars less, would fall 
on deaf ears. Finally, if people try to vent their frustration through aggression, they may 
become destructive and seek to sabotage efforts to combat climate change.<P>
