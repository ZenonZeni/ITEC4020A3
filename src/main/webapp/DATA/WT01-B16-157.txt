Program</B>
<P>
<P>Constipation.
<P>Eat 2 metamucil wafers daily followed by a glass of water. These make
a good snack and solve the constipation problem. They can be purchased at
the grocery store or a pharmacy.
<P>
<P>Dry mouth
<P>This is the most common side effect patients have. It may continue for
several months. It helps remind you to drink water which is desirable for
a weight loss program.
<P>
<P>Dizzy
<P>This usually comes from hypoglycemia. We recommend small frequent meals
to prevent blood sugar levels from getting too low.
<P>
<P>Headaches
<P>These are also usually caused by not eating often enough or not eating
enough protein to sustain blood sugar levels.
<P>
<P>Jittery and irritable
<P>This is a result of the stimulant effect of the phentermine. It is usually
a temporary side effect which will spontaneously disappear in two to three
days. Try to reduce other stimulants such as caffeine or nicotine during
this time. If the irritability persists and is not due to hypoglycemia, the
dosage of pondamin may need to be increased to balance the phentermine.
<P>
<P>Insomnia
<P>Most patients who experience this symptom will get over it in two to three
days. Taking the phentermine early and not consuming other stimulants such
as coffee or nicotine during this time can help. An over the counter benadryl
capsule can help if necessary.
<P>
<P>Prolonged menstrual bleeding or spotting
<P>This symptom is occasionally present. Taking 600mg of ibuprofen three
times a day will usually stop the bleeding. Ibuprofen is available without
a prescription.
<P>
<P>If you are having problems you can not resolve, please call us or
