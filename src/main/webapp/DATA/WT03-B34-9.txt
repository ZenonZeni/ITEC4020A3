UNIPETROL SET FOR DEBUT

Unipetrol, the giant new holding company for the Czech petrochemical
and oil refining industry, is due to formally emerge on 29 January,
when it is expected that all hurdles relating to the break-up of the
two companies that currently control the industry will have been
overcome.

The holding company is due to replace Chemopetrol Litvinov and Kaucuk
Kralupy, the two partly-privatised companies that currently own
petrochemical and refining interests. Shareholders in Chemopetrol and
Kaucuk, which are both listed on the Prague stock exchange, will
eventually receive shares in the holding company in lieu, although the
state will remain the largest shareholder in Unipetrol.

The creation of Unipetrol coincides with a big restructuring of the
petrochemical and refining industry. This involves a merger of the
petrochemical divisions of Chemopetrol and Kaucuk, which will become
wholly-owned by Unipetrol; and a merger of their refining interests
into Czech Refineries Company.

The international consortium of Royal Dutch/Shell, Agip and Conoco has
taken a 49% stake in Czech Refineries, while Unipetrol will control 51%
for at least five years. The consortium has paid $173m for the stake,
part of a $480m investment undertaking at the refineries that is
expected to begin in the spring.

Unipetrol will also acquire full control of Benzina, the state-owned
petrol retailing company. Its three divisions - petrochemicals,
refining and retailing - will make Unipetrol one of the biggest Czech
companies. It will be partially listed on the PSE but the state will
remain its controlling shareholder until plans have been completed for
either a flotation or the sale of a stake to a strategic partner.
Analysts have said the former is a more likely option, involving a
possible international share offering. They stressed, however, that no
such offer is likely for at least 18 months and probably longer.

The most difficult aspect of the restructuring, according to bankers at
CS First Boston, which is advising the government and Unipetrol, is
placing a value on the shares of Chemopetrol and Kaucuk and matching
that to the shares of Unipetrol so that private shareholders in both
existing companies get a full and fair price for their shares.

The transfer of the refining interests to Czech Refineries and the sale
of the stake to the consortium have been completed, which will allow
the investment programme to begin once Unipetrol has been incorporated.
Sources close to the consortium said delays to the agreement on Czech
Refineries - talks on the acquisition by the consortium were on and off
for over three years before a contract was signed last November - meant
that the $480m estimate for restructuring may have to be revise later.

The sources said that any delay in incorporating Unipetrol would also
push back the start date for the investment programme, which involves
heavy capital spending on an environmental clean-up and new equipment
at the refineries, because the programme is being carried out by the
holding company, as the majority owner in the refining company, and not
by the consortium.

However, those involved in the creation of Unipetrol said they were
confident it would emerge on schedule, although Unipetrol executives
cautioned that private shareholders may not receive their entitlement
to shares in exchange for the stakes they hold in Chemopetrol and
Kaucuk until the end of the year. In the meantime both Chemopetrol and
Kaucuk will retain their stock market quotations.

Between them, Chemopetrol and Kaucuk have a market capitalisation of
about $650m. With the addition of Benzina, the presence of the
international consortium, and increased efficiencies resulting from the
investment programme, Unipetrol is likely to be the fourth largest
company in the country in terms of market capitalisation, behind SPT
Telecom, the electricity utility CEZ, and Komercni Banka.

CHERNOBYL CLOSURE AGREEMENTS SIGNED

Ukraine on 20 December signed an agreement in Ottawa on the closure of
Chernobyl after seven years of protracted negotiations with the G-7
countries and the European Commission. The final text of the memorandum
of understanding (MOU) was agreed in Vienna at the end of November
after being stalled over two main issues: the date of closure and the
extent of Western financial support. Ukraine finally signed under
pressure after threats to withhold Western credits for economic
restructuring, say sources close to the talks.

The total on offer to Ukraine is $2.307bn in grants and loans and
represents only what had already been agreed. No new funding has been
made available. Ukraine had earlier rejected an offer of just over $2bn
in loans and grants made by the G-7 powers during talks in Kiev in
November as inadequate and continued to insist on a minimum of $4bn.

The MOU gives a financial breakdown including $498m in grants
comprising $43m for power sector restructuring, $102m for an energy
investment programme, $349m for nuclear safety and $4m for a social
impact plan. The $1.809bn in loans is to go to the energy investment
programme and includes Ecu400m from Euratom agreed at Corfu in 1994.
This programme will cover completion of Unit 2 at Khmelnitsky and Unit
4 at Rovno as well as rehabilitation of thermal and hydro plants,
pumped storage projects and energy efficiency.

The nuclear safety component is thought to comprise Tacis grants
already agreed at Corfu from the 1995 programme and Tacis 1996 as well
as $200m from the EBRD-administered Nuclear Safety Account agreed at
the Naples meeting in 1994. This may be used for preparatory work at
Chernobyl to pave the way for decommissioning, including the
construction of new waste treatment facilities. In principle, says the
MOU, revenue-generating projects will be considered for loans and non-
revenue-generating projects for grants.

The final wording of the MOU was "deliberately vague" to allow
different interpretations, say Western sources close to G-7. Ukraine
objected to the deadline of 2000 as the date for closure and this was
omitted from the title in the final version, although it remains in the
text which says decommissioning will be undertaken within the "shortest
practically achievable time". Ukrainian officials say this is unlikely
to be by 2000.

Ukrainian environment and nuclear safety minister Yuri Kostenko says
that by 2000 only reactor shutdown will be possible. "Removal of the
facility and ensuring its ecological safety will take over a decade.
Chernobyl will need tremendous sums for shutdown operations, running
into billions of dollars over many years. This is why Ukraine sees the
memorandum only as the beginning." he adds.

Chernobyl, which produces over 5% of Ukraine's power exceeded its
annual target in 1995 producing a total of 11.5 TWh of electricity -
some 5% above the planned figure.

* Goskomatom, the Ukrainian state committee for nuclear power, is still
without a head, after former chairman Mikhail Umanets was dismissed in
November. However he formally resigned in January which should ease the
way for appointment of a successor. Meanwhile his deputy Nur
Nigmatullin is carrying on with the day-to-day business and may
eventually take over. The other main contender is Valery Kukhar, head
of the Presidential committee on nuclear policy and ecology.

GERMANS PAY TOP PRICES IN HUNGARY AS EDF DIVERGES

The German consortium RWE/Energie Versorgung Schwaben (EVS) paid a
total of almost $600m for stakes in two electricity supply companies
and Matra power station, the daily Magyar Hirlap reported on 8 January.
The sum included $358m for the Budapest supplier, ELMU, or 175% of book
value for the 46% stake, and $164m, 150% of book value, for the 49%
stake in the north Hungarian supplier, EMASZ.

According to the paper's figures, which have not been publicly refuted
by APV Rt, only Matra power station failed to meet its book value, the
38% stake selling at 77% of its nominal registered capital.

Shortly after the sale of EDASZ and DEMASZ stakes to Electricite de
France, the Hungarian press picked up on Austrian reports that EdF had
earlier made a secret agreement to pass on some of its shares to the
Austrian power company Verbundgesellschaft. The reasoning is that
tender rules restricted bidders from forming more than one consortium,
and EdF were formally part of the consortium bidding for the 24% MVM
stake. Thus EdF was unable to declare a formal consortium for the
supply companies.

The economic daily Napigazadasag quoted an unnamed spokesman of EdF as
saying that a 15% packet of the EdF-owned stake had been reserved for
Verbundgesellschaft. The spokesman is also quoted as saying a partner
is also being courted to take some of the stake in South Hungarian
supplier DEMASZ owned by EdF, although the French company intends to
remain the dominant partner in both supply companies.

Tender conditions restrict owners from selling any of the newly
acquired shares for five years, or from obtaining shares from any
source other than APV Rt, unless permission is received for such
transactions from the Hungarian Energy Office (MEH), the Competition
(Fair Trading) Office, and APV Rt itself.

The business bulletin Econews reported that APV Rt might be willing to
give its consent to bringing in other partners provided "the move
served Hungary's industrial policy". It also reported of a possible
linkage in the wrangle between MVM and Verbundgesellschaft over the
contract to export Hungarian electricity to Austria in return for the
debt incurred due to the now-abandoned Danube barrage scheme. Austria
has appealed to the courts over the matter.

An Austrian guarantee to drop the appeal "may be an important factor"
in any APV Rt decision regarding consent for a share transfer, Econews
quotes an APV Rt official as saying. EdF Budapest representative Pierre
Abou told EEE there are "several potential partners" interested in
cooperation in the two supply companies, but "nothing is decided in any
direction. We wish to keep it discreet. When [negotiations] are
completed we shall give priority to the Hungarian authorities. These
are sensitive issues". Abou said the route to EdF winning the two
tenders was "a long-lasting story. We have been working together in the
past with the two companies. It's not just a bid like that, for some
financial reasons. We didn't just decide to bid last October. You
cannot bid just like that, especially in the power sector, you must be
on the ground years before".

Asked if he was concerned about the pricing conditions, Abou said "we
are paying a big attention to this issue, that's absolutely normal, but
we are not that concerned. The principles in the law which state that
the costs of transmission, generation and distribution must be covered
by the tariffs at each step. Plus the decree with its formulae ensuring
normal earning to the investors. If we had not found it acceptable, we
would not have bid, of course. I don't know any country where this
pricing issue is not politically sensitive and can be left to its
normal course, not in Britain, nor the US, and certainly not in the
countries in transition. We are relatively confident in the good state
of mind of the Hungarian authorities. Of course it will be sensitive in
the future, but they realise in the future energy prices must be
consistent with costs, and provide normal earning to the operators".
* Contrary to information given to EEE last December (EEE 49/34), MVM
sources say there was no move by MVM to cancel the long-term power
purchase contracts. "MVM is very happy with these agreements," EEE was
informed, "it was Schroders who were pushing for changes because they
thought the bidders were not very happy with the contracts due to the
risk allocation. There have been no changes from the contracts signed
on October 10th".

EDF SECURES MOCHOVCE ROLE

Electricite de France (EdF) has finally secured itself a role in
Slovakia's drive to complete its controversial nuclear power station at
Mochovce, following the signing of an agreement in Bratislava before
Christmas that will see the French utility provide technical and
support services in the completion of the first two 440 MW reactors at
the plant.

Work on finalising Mochovce is expected to restart early this year
after months of delay caused partially by the row between Slovakia and
the EBRD over financing for the project. The signing of the agreement
between EdF and Slovak Electricity (SE) means that French expertise
will now be applied to the project, even though the Slovak government
rejected an offer of financing from the EBRD that involved EdF as a
main contractor (EEE 48/2).

It is still not clear whether the Slovak government has secured
definite financing from Russia to complete the Soviet- designed plant.
Moscow has offered $150m in technical and financial support to Mochovce
as an alternative to the EBRD proposal, which would have cost DM1.4bn.
The government rejected the bank's offer late last year in favour of an
alternative offer put forward by Slovak and Czech banks and engineering
companies which claims Mochovce can be completed for DM1bn. The Russian
offer of financing is a vital part of this alternative project.

SE said at the signing of the agreement with EdF that the plant will be
completed to comply with the safety standards of the International
Atomic Energy Agency. The involvement of the French company may help to
ease fears that safety would be compromised if Western companies were
not to be used to complete construction of the Mochovce plant.

Both the government and SE have stepped up their commitment to the
completion of Mochovce to meet a big rise in demand for energy as the
economy continues to expand. Electricity consumption has risen this
year by around 8%. SE said before Christmas that it hoped agreements
with its banks and contractors would be signed in the spring and that
production of electricity at Mochovce would begin by the end of 1997 or
early 1998.

Vladimir Grujbar, director of strategic planning at SE, said that
framework conditions for contracts with suppliers and banks would be in
place by the end of 1995 and that construction could be resumed in
March. He said the company aimed to have the first block ready for
commissioning by December 1997. The company is currently hoping that
the first reactor will become operational in the middle of 1998 and the
second reactor nine months to a year later.

Energoprojekt Praha, the Czech engineering firm, will be the general
designer for the project, while Skoda Praha will be the general
contractor for the supply of plant and equipment. The Slovak
construction group Hydrostav will be the main contractor for the civil
engineering works at the site. Safety improvement studies will be
carried out by Siemens of Germany and Framatome of France in
conjunction with Skoda Praha and experts supplied by the Russian
nuclear industry.

Apart from the Russian offer of $150m in financing, additional funding
will be provided by the Czech banks Komercni Banka and Ceska
Sporitelna, which are offering loans of around $200m and DM200m
respectively.

* Slovakia's only operating nuclear plant at Bohunice generated 11,437
GWh of electricity last year, exceeding its annual target by 0.33%, the
news agency TASR reported. The head of the plant's public and foreign
relations department, Dobroslav Dobak, said only four deviations from
standard operational procedures had been observed, none of which were
relevant to safety concerns. The four blocks at the plant account for
over half the country's generation which totalled 22,861 GWh last year,
with the rest being divided by hydro generation (22.5%) and thermal
generation (27.4%). Power imports increased to 3,786 GWh with domestic
sales up 9% in 1995.

NEW LAW COULD BOOST ROMANIAN OIL SECTOR

Romania has issued its long-delayed petroleum law which Western
analysts say is satisfactory and expected to lead to an upturn in the
country's oil industry.

"I think the new law is workable. We can work with it," Jean Bernard
Siri, general manager of Shell Romania Exploration BVsaid. President
lon lliescu has promulgated the law, which will become effective
starting 28 March, the Official Gazette said.

The law defines Romania's oil resources as public property, covers
concessions, taxes and royalties and puts local and foreign oil
operators on an equal footing, enabling them to secure oil blocks
through public tenders. "It (the law) is a positive thing," a Western
analyst said. "I don't mean that Romania will now see thousands of
investors rushing to put money in the oil sector but many will find it
an incentive as they have solid legislation to deal with".

Under the law, profits are exempted from tax during one year following
start-up of production. Imported equipment and personal effects are
exempt from customs duties. Oil operators will deal directly with the
National Agency for Mineral Resources (ANRM), the licensing authority
in charge of mineral rights administration.

By mid-June, ANMR is expected to launch a tender offer for 14 onshore
and offshore blocks believed to contain hydrocarbons (EEE 50/22).
Facilities include the possibility for oil operators to negotiate
royalties with the ANRM on a case-by-case basis. Annual tax on
exploitation is set at some 3.0% of the value of output.

Foreign operators are granted a series of privileges, including the
possibility to export the oil produced and to keep their hard currency
earnings in accounts abroad. They are also allowed to convert local leu
currency earnings - from local sales of oil - into hard currency on the
inter-bank market and to transfer the amounts to foreign accounts.

Development of the bill, initiated in 1993, has been slow mainly
because of repeated reviews of its text following objections by both
government officials and oil operators. The final version gives local
and foreign oil operators equal access to the national petroleum
transport system. It makes no reference to international arbitration -
a concern of foreign executives in the past - saying disputes should be
settled by "competent courts, according to the law".

* Romania produced 6.7mt of crude in 1995, little changed from the
previous year, Mediafax news agency reported. It quoted a senior
industry ministry official as saying that natural gas production was
19.09bncm last year, compared to 19.6bncm in 1994. In 1995 the country
imported 8.36mt of crude, compared to 8.12mt in 1994, the official
said. Gas imports were put at 6.63bncm, a sharp rise from the 1994
total of 4.64bncm.

HUNGARIAN POWER DEMAND RISES 2.5% ON 1994 FIGURES

Hungarian electricity demand grew by 2.5% in 1995 compared to 1994
figures according to provisional MVM figures obtained by EEE. Total
demand rose to 36,167 GWh, 897 GWh up from the previous year (35,270
GWh), and 1,167 GWh (3.3%) above the MVM business plan. Peak load of
5,731 MW occurred in the cold spell on 18 January.

MVM provisional 1995 figures show almost 300 MW of the year on increase
(and over 920 MW compared to the business plan) was produced by coal
and lignite-fired stations, and 115 MW (12.8%) by the hydrocarbon fired
plants. Imports increased by 381 MW. Commenting on the figures, MVM
director of power plant operation Karoly Gerse told EEE the 2.5%
increase in consumption could be put down roughly equally to increasing
industrial demand and colder weather in January and autumn last year.

Industrial demand has been showing growth since about mid-1994, with
both new industry and older sectors contributing to the increase. The
revitalisation of chemicals, aluminium industry and some older
factories such as the Raba engine plant in Gyor and light-engineering
around Szekesfehervar are all believed to have contributed to demand
growth. The service sector is also significant for the power sector,
Gerse said, as increased use of air-conditioning equipment has meant a
jump in demand of some 10 MW from 1993 to 1995 in the hot summer
months, resulting in a "much healthier [load-curve] for MVM".

Domestic demand levels off

Domestic demand is believed to have just about levelled off. While the
decline in average standard of living plus more modern machinery has
reduced demand in some ways, against this the new-moneyed class is
making more use of domestic appliances like air-conditioning equipment.
In addition, there has been increasing number of self-employed using
home-based machinery since 1989.

On the production side, the production manager said there is "a new
philosophy" regarding coal-fired stations. Integration of the coal
mines with the stations has resulted in higher fixed costs, while
variable operating costs have decreased. This makes it more economical
to increase utilisation of the coal-fired units in order to reduce the
effects of fixed costs. "In addition, although oil prices have not
risen so much, except for forint devaluation, gas prices have increased
significantly, so policy has moved more to coal, and somewhat more to
oil," Gerse said.

Questioned as to possible means of reducing production costs, he said
the most effective would be to change the fuel structure, switching to
imported steam coal, which would "significantly reduce prices".
Politically, however, this is currently not a practical solution. MVM
profited from an 8% price rise (a two-month lag on consumer price rise
due partly to slow bill-paying) on 1 January. A second 18% increase is
due in March, with a yet to be decided third hike in October or
November.

LUKOIL CONTINUES TO HARBOUR KAZAKH PIPELINE AMBITIONS

Lukoil, Russia's largest oil producer, has confirmed an interest in
joining an alternative to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), the
creation of which is currently being considered by the Kazakh
authorities. The existing consortium, set up in 1992 by Kazakhstan,
Russia and Oman with the aim of constructing a pipeline for the
transportation of oil produced by the Tengizchevroil (the joint venture
between Chevron and Kazakhstan) to Russia's Black Sea port of
Novorrossiisk, has failed to raise the necessary funds.

Alexander Vasilenko, a spokesman for Lukoil, said the company's
contribution to the new consortium came down to financing, offering its
construction facilities or crude swaps of early productions. The
spokesman said the latter option is the most acceptable for Lukoil. The
proposals are currently being considered by the Kazakh side.

According to Vasilenko, a Lukoil delegation was supposed to leave for
Alma Aty late last month to finalise the deal, but the trip was
postponed at the request of the Kazakh side. The spokesman refused to
name the approximate date of the next meeting, saying only that it
depends on the Kazakh side's decision. He added that an agreement has
been reached at an intergovernmental level on the subject, which was
formally initiated in a letter sent by Viktor Chernomyrdin to the
Kazakh president. Vasilenko said that his company's plans in no way
contradict the obligations Russia has undertaken in the CPC, but only
"makes them more detailed".

Lukoil is already participating in a number of projects in Kazakhstan
and the company's prime aim has always been to get a share in the
development of the Tengiz field. Lukoil's possible participation in the
new pipeline consortium is viewed by industry analysts as a step
towards satisfying this ambition. Vasilenko refused to talk of his
company's interest in receiving a slice of Tengiz project. At present
Kazakhstan is thinking of giving a part of its share in the
Tengizchevroil venture to some Western oil companies, with Mobil being
the prime candidate, with the intention of breathing new life into the
pipeline development by forming a new consortium for its construction
(EEE 50/5).

A meeting of the CPC directorate was scheduled to be held in Moscow
before the end of the month, a source at Transneft, Russia's state
pipeline operator which represents Russia's interest in the existing
consortium, told EEE. A possible agenda of the meeting is said to
include the restructuring of the consortium's membership in the light
of the Kazakh's intention to form an alternative consortium. The new
membership composition concerns first of all of Western oil companies,
such as Mobil and Chevron, but nothing was said about Lukoil's
participation. Earlier Chevron refused to enter the CPC on the terms
proposed by the consortium - ie. that it was supposed to provide a
lion's share of the financing only for a 25% stake in the CPC.

Chevron views stalemate

Chevron said on 19 January that it saw no end to the impasse in its
talks with the CPC, despite reports that a key stumbling block could be
leaving the consortium. The Wall Street Journal reported that Dutch oil
trader John Deuss had agreed to resign as president of Oman Oil Co and
appeared to be ready to leave the CPC as well. However, Chevron
spokesman Mike Libbey said "our problem wasn't with Mr Deuss but with
the unreasonable business terms of the CPC". However, the presence of
Oman in the consortium has long been seen as a key stumbling block by
many observers with the company standing to benefit considerably when
it was neither the source of the oil or directly involved in the
development of the fields concerned. However, Chevron has said that it
will no longer just rely on a single route to get its Tengiz production
out with Libbey stating "multiple export routes are going to be
needed".

Lukoil said on 12 January that it produced 57.5mt of oil in 1995, an
increase of 87,000t on 1994's level. A company release also said the
company refined 19mt of oil in 1995, an increase of 1.8mt on 1994
figures. The company produced 2.6mt of petrol, over 4.6mt of diesel and
about 5.3mt of mazut.

* Russia and Azerbaijan have signed a long-awaited oil transit
agreement, viewed as an essential step for developing the Caspian Sea.
The delay in signing the agreement, which had been finalised last
autumn, was causing concern among members of the international
consortium which is exploiting the Azeri oilfields. The signatories
blamed the delay purely on "technical problems". The Azeri government
has guaranteed that at least 5mt of oil a year will flow through the
Russian pipeline system by the year 2002 for export onto world markets.
The oil will flow through an existing pipeline infrastructure, which
runs from the Azeri capital of Baku through the troubled region of
Chechnya to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorrossiisk. Valery
Chernayev, the president of Transneft, the Russian pipeline operator,
said this route was the best option. But concerns about the political
instability in Chechnya have ensured other outlets are being developed
for Caspian oil, via Georgia and Turkey.

RENEL RAISES PRICES ON BACK OF DEVALUATION

The devaluation of the Romanian Lev is the justification for an
impending rise in electricity tariffs, according to Romanian state
power company Renel.

Current prices of Lev46/kWh for residential consumers and Lev110/kWh
for commercial consumers were calculated last year on an exchange rate
of Lev1,910 to the dollar; due to depreciation towards the end of 1995
the currency now stands at Lev2,583 to the dollar. A Renel spokesman
said that any further fall would necessitate a price hike "sooner
rather than later".

Under an agreement with the IMF, electricity prices cannot be modified
more than twice a year. After the impending rise, prices are likely to
be Lev62/kWh for households and Lev150/kWh for commercial consumption.

Meanwhile, according to end-of-year statistics released by Renel this
month, domestic electricity consumption in 1995 rose by 7.4% compared
with the previous year, with the private commercial sector accounting
for half of the increase. The company's thermal energy deliveries in
1995 were up 5.6% from 1994. The residential heating share rose to 50%
last year compared with 30% in 1989.

To meet the mounting energy demand, Renel was forced to raise
production, particularly from coal-fuelled TPPs whose output was 3.8%
over 1994. With 1995 electricity imports totalling 130 MW (average
power), compared with total exports of 152 MW, Romania achieved an
electricity trade surplus, confining its external power dependence to
imports of primary resources, a senior company executive said. Renel's
emergency fuel stocks at the end of 1995 totalled 3mt of lignite,
250,000t of black coal and pitcoal within "normal limits".

Renel is set to increase its energy supply to Bucharest heating utility
Radet by 25%, to a total 12,600t calories, under a new contract to be
finalised shortly. Under the contract's liability terms the companies
will be entitled to exact penalties from each other for the potential
malfunctions of the heating system, Radet executive Gheorghe Dabela
told the press. Thus, Renel will incur penalties for failure to meet
the supply needs of Radet, while Radet will be liable for excess
heating agent amounts, water hardness etc. The companies have yet to
agree on payment terms, with Radet pushing to maintain the current
method of daily cheques due to unreliability. The contract will be
signed as soon as this matter has been resolved.

UNOCAL BRIEFS PAKISTAN ON TURKMENIAN PIPELINE PLANS

A team from Unocal has updated Pakistani officials on its plans to
build oil and gas pipelines from Turkmenistan to Pakistan via
Afghanistan at an estimated cost of $8bn.

"There is developed gas in Turkmenistan with no market and there is a
ready market here in Pakistan," Richard Keller, president of Unocal
Pakistan, told Reuters on 17 January. "The project makes sense from
that point of view," Keller said. "We are working to finalise routes
from the technical and political perspective within the next few
months".

Unocal, in 60/40 collaboration with Delta Oil Company of Saudi Arabia,
plans to build a 1,271km gas pipeline from the Turkmen border to the
Sui gas fields in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan.
Turkmenistan, which signed agreements on the projects with Unocal and
Delta in October (EEE 49/31), has earmarked the fully developed
Daulatabad field, 160km from the Afghan border, with reserves of 45
trillion cubic feet of gas - about double Pakistan's own official gas
reserves - to supply Pakistan.

The pipeline, with a capacity of 2bncf/d and six compressor stations,
is expected to cost $3bn. Fluor Daniel has been retained as consulting
engineers to establish a route, design and detailed cost estimate.
Unocal also plans to build a 1,800km oil pipeline from Chardzhou in
Turkmenistan to a marine terminal to be built at Gwadar on Pakistan's
southwestern coast. The pipeline will have a capacity of about one
million barrels per day and cost an estimated $5bn. A detailed project
analysis is due to be completed by November.

Keller said Unocal was interested in helping to plan the Gwadar
terminal, which could be used to export Turkmenistan's oil to growing
markets in South and Southeast Asia. He said the financing of the
pipeline projects had not yet been worked out, but financial
consultants JP Morgan would be talking with international lending
organisations.

Keller said Unocal would prefer to build both pipelines at the same
time to save construction costs. The pipelines would run parallel for
part of the route. Resource certification, planning and design would
take about a year, but he could not say how long it would take to
clinch agreements with governments concerned and business partners. It
could take a further year to complete financing and two years to
construct the pipelines.

These would cross Afghanistan, through territory now held by the
Islamic Taleban militia, which captured western Afghanistan up to the
Turkmen border from government forces last year. Keller said no
official talks had been held with the Kabul government led by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and stressed that Unocal wanted to stay clear of
Afghan politics, adding that the Afghan imbroglio was "the big question
mark in the minds of lenders. There would have to be a political
settlement, or something that would satisfy lending institutions,"
Keller said.

POLES MAKE MORE COAL MOVES

The Polish government has abandoned the monopoly on coal trading
granted to Weglokoks, Weglozbyt and Kopex and their subsidiaries last
year (EEE 47/10). The decision came after pressure from the anti-
monopoly office. From 15 December last all "reliable" firms are allowed
to deal in coal.

Nevertheless, the new rules encouraged coal companies to have direct
contracts with power generators, district heating providers, coking
plants, cement works, steelworks, the state railways, and other large
users. These contracts were expected to define quantities, quality,
delivery dates, payment terms, and claims procedures, and they were to
be drawn up under Polish law. Reliable firms could act as
intermediaries in this trade. In addition, the rules did not apply
where purchasers paid prior to, or upon, delivery.

In an interview with the Rzeczpospolita newspaper, deputy industry
minister Jerzy Markowski noted that the ministry could afford to drop
the monopoly rules because they had done their job. He said that they
had persuaded the coal trading companies Weglokoks, Weglozbyt and Kopex
to guarantee bank loans needed to pay the miners in December, and had
encouraged a number of coal companies to sign agreements which did not
include any intermediaries.

Meanwhile, Poland's socio-economic strategy council, a body advising
the Cabinet, has approved subsidies of some Z8bn ($3.2bn), officially
for closing down uneconomic mines, contained in the restructuring plan
for the mines proposed by Markowski (EEE 50/11). There was, however, a
significant split between academics who favoured centralising the
mining industry, and those who argued that mines should be left largely
to their own devices to see which ones were viable.

The majority of the council favoured centralising. Neither was there
agreement over forecasts for coal demand; one professor warned that
demand could fall by 30% if users adopted more energy efficient
equipment; another set demand at 90-100mt/yr for the next few years.
Current production is 130mt/yr, and the Markowski plan envisages
cutting it to 110mt by 2000.

At the same time, Markowski noted that the Budryk and Bogdanka mines
were due to be privatised as soon as his restructuring programme came
into force. The two mines, which are the only ones not to be part of
the holding company structures, would be taken over by the banks that
had been lending them money - notably Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy w
Krakowie, and Powszechny Bank Kredytowy w Warszawie. The two mines are
considered to be the most profitable in Poland.

RUES STRUGGLES WITH SALE AMID CONTINUED PAYMENT PROBLEMS

Only 0.62% of shares in the Russian Unified Energy Systems (RUES) were
sold off in October to December from the 4.5% stake offered at a
nationwide auction, a company statement said.

According to Aleksander Lopatin, deputy head of the RUES securities
department, the state, which is a main company shareholder (holding 60%
of the shares), initially intended to put twice as many shares up for
auction but the company's management succeeded in persuading it to
split the block into two lots. The second one of the same size will be
offered for sale in 1996. According to the auction, RUES received only
14% of the R130bn proceeds, the rest going to the federal budget.

The shares were offered for auction at their face value. At the same
time their price on the secondary market was 3-4 times lower than this
figure. The statement said that all the shares were bought off by the
company's employees "with their own savings".

Judging by the present price of shares on the OTC market, the cost of
each kW power capacity of the utility is valued at not more than $8.
But according to the company's management, its real value is over
$1,000.

Lopatin said that most of the preparatory work on the company's ADR
programme had been completed. RUES received the approval of the US
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last May and from last
September, work has begun on putting all documents in order. Formally
it is necessary to collect the signatures of the RUES board of
directors to sign an agreement with the Bank of New York, the company's
partner in the programme. At the same time, Lopatin refused to name the
exact date of its official presentation, saying only that "it should be
fairly soon".

In 1995, the Russian power generating sector received $2bn in
investments, this year the figure is expected to grow up to $3-3.5bn.
Low electricity tariffs (2-3 cents per kWh) keep foreign investors from
putting money into the industry. At the same time, RUES own investments
are prevented by non-payments. In September, the government railed
against cutoffs to main RUES non-payers and since then the debt to the
company has increased by one third, reaching R32 trillion.

Emphasis on Russian supplies

According to Anatoly Dyakov, president of RUES, in 1995 the company
installed about 1m kW of generating capacity, and built 14,000km of
power transmission lines. "We've had no strikes or emergencies and
we've preserved all the jobs. We're operating on domestic equipment -
all spare parts are Russian-made".

Dyakov explains that, although new technologies are needed, the company
is insisting that everything should be produced at Russian factories.
"Western companies cooperating with domestic machine-builders have
understood us and accepted this condition," he notes.

Nonpayment is the weak point, Dyakov admits, with customers owing
R39,400bn and debts to suppliers totalling R31,200bn. "One of the
biggest nonpayers is the state itself in the budget-financed sphere,"
he says. "We suggested a mutual offset but everything depends on the
finance ministry, which does not want to lose tax receipts into the
treasury".

Dyakov adds that the power engineers were the main victims of a
government decision in autumn to freeze the prices of electricity,
natural gas and railway transportation. "On 1 October gas cost R257,000
per 1,000cm. but on 6 October the gas industry set a different price -
R275,000 excluding VAT. Overnight all our stations became unprofitable,
now we're loss-makers". The government agreed that RUES could pay
Gazprom at the previous price, but the gas company cut off supplies to
electrical stations, he explains. "But we have been strictly forbidden
to cut off supplies, and as soon as users realised that they faced no
penalty they ceased paying us altogether". Nonpayments in October-
November rocketed by R9,000bn, he complains.

The planned establishment of a Federal power commission should help to
solve these problems, Dyakov believes. "It will be concerned not just
with electricity, but also with gas, coal and oil. Let them calculate,
coordinate, harmonise the sectoral rates".

Nevertheless, construction of new plants is continuing. The electricity
rate includes an investment component of 13%. "But we don't have enough
funds. We already owe the builders about R100bn. At the Kolyma hydro
plant wages have not been paid for a year. They even introduced money
of their own. We paid them off by barter. We took foodstuffs from
Krasnodar (they also owe us for electricity, and they haven't got money
either) and delivered them by plane to Kolyma. But in spite of this,
the builders did get the fourth 180 MW power unit at Kolyma on stream".

Dyakov would like to see a change in the price structure. "Before 1992
the rate for the population was the highest at four kopecks per kWh
while industry paid 1.8 and agriculture one kopeck. Now the ratio is
reversed and industry subsidises the population". He hopes the payments
situation will be resolved this year and more investment attracted to
the industry. However he has no illusions about investment from the
West. "We've got controlled rates, and they'll always remain so and
will be lower than in the West. Investors must be Russian ones. But so
far the R500 shares of RUES are selling at a price below their face
value. I have suggested to the government that they should allow us to
buy the shares at face value, in payment of the budget debt. The
government will replenish the budget and we'll accumulate those shares
and, when the market changes, sell them at a profit. They'll become a
source of investment, I have no doubt". Dyakov says Russia's
electricity rates cannot be set at world levels and should take into
account the population's ability to pay. He also warns that if federal
power commission decisions go against the interests of the power
industry, the management of RUES will fight this in the courts.

While Dyakov acknowledges that each station under the RUES umbrella is
a separate stock company, he resents the go-it-alone attitude of some
of the more wealthy companies. Some Siberian companies are insisting on
operating independently. These companies run hydro plants which produce
cheap power. "The rates at our stations are totalled and an average
value is determined for power transfer to areas facing shortages," he
explains. "Irkutsk, Bratsk, and Ust-Ilimsk hydropower plants produce
the cheapest electricity. The whole country built them and their
inclusion in the general system undoubtedly would lower the general
rate". But instead they are selling electricity within the region
several times cheaper. In Irkutsk one kWh of electricity costs the
rural population R8, while the price in Moscow is R130. Dyakov says
that 52 member regions have electricity shortages, and only 20 have a
surplus. "What would happen if all of them operated in their own
interests?" he asks. "Tearing the power industry apart means tearing
the country apart".

POLES SEEK POSTPONEMENT OF FUEL IMPORT LIBERALISATION

The Polish government has asked the European Union for an extended
adjustment period for its oil refining and distribution sector (and its
agriculture), according to prime minister Jozef Oleksy. The government
expected neither to these industries to be in a condition to face
foreign competition soon and wants a postponement of a deadline for
liberalising fuel imports to 1999 from 1997.

"If the deadline is not moved the fate of our refineries will be under
threat" industry minister Klemens Scierski said on 11 January. Under
Poland's association agreement with the EU, Poland should lift barriers
protecting the fuel market, including duties and quotas, by the end of
1996. Foreign oil companies took the view that delaying the
liberalisation of the Polish refining and distribution sector would cut
down their interest in investing in the country.

Meanwhile, Poland's main refineries, Petrochemia Plock and Rafineria
Gdanska, were preparing to put up their petrol prices. They cited
higher oil prices, which had risen to around $18/bbl by the end of last
year. The government could delay the proposed price rises by a maximum
of three months.

The refineries argued that oil prices accounted for up to 90% of the
production costs of petrol, and said that they would consider
abandoning the increases if oil prices fell below $17/bbl. A
Petrochemia Plock spokesman noted that the average price for oil paid
by the refinery during the first nine months of 1995 was $16.99/bbl,
falling as low as $15.60/bbl during the summer.

At the same time, the Polish government has adjusted import tariffs on
petrol and diesel fuel. Duties on petrol imports from the EU, EFTA, and
the central European free market CEFTA (ie Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Hungary, and Slovenia, as well as Poland) have been set at 15% for
1996. This compares with 12% for the EU and EFTA in 1995, and 10% for
CEFTA countries. The rate for other countries - such as Russia - goes
back to 25%, having been temporarily cut to 15% last year. For diesel
fuel, the rate from EU, EFTA, and CEFTA countries is 25%, which is a
reduction from 28% for the EU and EFTA, and a rise from 23.3% for
CEFTA. The rate for other countries is 35%.

The target rates for 1996 contained in Poland's association agreement
with the EU were 9% for petrol, and 21% for diesel. But there are no
penalties attached to failing to meet those targets. What does need to
be discussed with the EU are import quotas, and concessions for
importers. Talks were scheduled for early December, but were put off by
EU officials until mid February.

ROMANIA AND GAZPROM ESTABLISH JOINT VENTURE

Russian gas supplier Gazprom has drafted a bilateral Romania-Russia
government accord for the construction of a gas pipeline in Romania,
according to Interfax news agency.

Under the accord, Gazprom and Romanian counterpart Romgaz would set up
a 50/50 joint stock company to design, finance, build and operate the
line to carry Russian gas to consumers in Romania and neighbouring
countries. The 15-year deal gives the joint venture ownership of the
facilities it builds in Romania and provides for leasing and subsequent
purchasing of existing Romanian gas transport facilities, the report
said.

The Romanian government would exempt the venture and its founders from
customs duty, income and land taxes and other charges linked to
building and operating gas production facilities. The Russian
government would exempt Gazprom from export duty on equipment and
materials needed for the line. Natural gas exported to Romanian
customers could not be re-exported without Gazprom's consent.

Shortfall in supplies

Romania's supply of natural gas from the Russian Federation has been
short by 2mcm/d since 31 December, according to Romgaz executive Stafan
Man. Russian suppliers have blamed the reduction, which represents a
shortfall of 15% below contract levels, on extremely low outside
temperatures, Man said.

Romgaz delivers an average 38-40% of its total output to residential
consumers, rising to more than half of its output during peak times.
The company began drawing on underground reserves as early as November
and has had to raise daily deliveries by about 10% since the beginning
of January, Man said.

To add to the pressure, Bucharest's public finance board froze the
Romgaz account last month over the company's failure to pay Lev200bn in
outstanding taxes, with the result that Romgaz is unable to afford any
excess expenditure on its transport system whether for maintenance,
operation or spare parts. Romgaz itself meanwhile is unable to recover
Lev900bn in bill arrears, more than half of which is owed by state
power company Renel. Other major debtors include large plants in the
metal-processing, machine-building and chemical industries. Domestic
industries would virtually grind to a standstill should Romgaz cut off
supplies, Man warned.

A priority for the troubled gas company this year is the replacement of
pipeline. Nearly 40% of Romgaz pipes lack cathode protection, which
leads to early corrosion and could pose a serious blast threat,
according to company official Ioan Husu. At present Romgaz operates
only two mobile laboratories for the monitoring of cathode
deterioration, a wholly inadequate number given the size of the
country's gas supply system, he said. The company is scheduled to
replace 200km of a total 11,000km of pipeline this year.

BULGARIA TO TEST REACTOR VESSEL AND GO AHEAD WITH STORAGE

Bulgarian officials announced in December that the country would agree
that three or four templets from the body of the controversial Unit 1
at Kozlodui could be taken later this year. However, the EU is still
urging Bulgaria to close the reactor as soon as possible.

According to Yanko Yanev, head of the national committee on the
peaceful uses of atomic energy, the tests will be done either by
Siemens or Westinghouse. The operation will continue for 5-6 months and
will cost about $500,000-600,000. The European Commission is planning
to cover these expenses. Speaking at a press conference, Yanev insisted
that Russian experts will be allowed to participate in all stages of
the tests.

National Electricity Company (NEC) acting chairman Trifon Tsvetkov said
"we decided to seek ways for an earlier closure for tests of reactor
number one and we may close it around 15 May if the weather is warm
enough". He said he had discussed carrying out the tests with EU
officials in Brussels and more talks were expected to take place before
the end of the month.

Unit 1 at the plant sparked international concern after it was
restarted by the Bulgarians in October last year (EEE 49/14) after
several months safety upgrading work. The EU urged the country to close
the 440 MW reactor in return for compensatory energy supplies. However,
the country is not currently linked to the Western European system
although it could receive power supply via the former Yugoslavia.

On 15 January Bulgaria added it would not allow safety checks without
the participation of its own experts. "We will not agree to additional
tests of the vessel's metal (of reactor number one) without Bulgarian
participation," Yanev told a news conference. "We also raised the
question of participation by the reactor's producer (Russia) in the
checks," Yanev said.

The EU Phare programme envisages aid of some Ecu40m for the Bulgarian
energy sector in the next four years, Yanev said, adding that half of
it would be allocated to nuclear safety upgrading. Yanev said a credit
for the modernisation of Kozlodui's two 1,000 MW reactors has also been
discussed in Brussels, adding Bulgaria hopes to receive a $150m loan
from the European Investment Bank for this.

Low radioactive waste storage approved

Meanwhile, the Energoproekt R&D institute has developed a final draft
for the construction of a large storage facility for low-radioactive
waste at the Kozlodui plant. The project has been endorsed by the
environment ministry and partial financing from the EU is already in
place. Construction should be completed in 18 months, according to
officials.

The project provides for building a storage facility for two bodies of
total capacity 10,000cm. It will hold 2,000 steel-concrete containers
made by the Bulgarian company Balbok. Six wells will facilitate regular
testing of the level of radioactivity of underground water.
Comprehensive safety measures against earthquakes and other accidents
have been provided for. Waste and refuse with low and medium
radioactivity will be kept in the storage, ie waste clothes and
instrumentation, oil, resins and valves.

For the present, no construction of storage facilities for highly-
radioactive waste has been planned. However, this may become necessary
if Moscow starts returning spent fuel from the Kozlodui plant. The
bilateral Bulgarian-Russian agreement on nuclear energy cooperation
contains such a clause. A plant for recycling radioactive waste is
already under construction at the plant. with technology supplied by
Westinghouse. The project is co-financed by the EU.

* Bulgaria has made progress in meeting recommendations of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in upgrading safety at four
reactors at Kozlodui, an IAEA representative said on 19 January. A five-
day IAEA mission has been visiting the plant to collect information on
the implementation of safety measures recommended by the agency in
1991. "We found that the plant feels very concerned with the resolution
of the safety measures and progress has been accomplished in several
areas of concern" said Georges Norvez, head of the mission. Norvez
stressed that there was still much work to be done to fulfils all the
IAEA requirements. "Completion of the modifications planned in 1996 and
1997 will be a very separate step" he added.

MOL FIGURES FAIL TO DAMPEN OPTIMISM

MOL's three-quarter figures proved something of a disappointment when
announced last month. These were the first figures to be released
following the partial flotation of the company in November-December
(EEE 51/5).

MOL had nine-month net sales of Ft 231.7bn producing operating profits
of Ft6.8bn. Whilst third quarter revenues were normal given the
seasonal nature of gas sales, the operating profit was only Ft0.3bn up
on the six-month figure of Ft6.5bn. After tax profit figures, at
Ft3.2bn at the end of June, fell to Ft2.3bn at the end of September,
paint an even less rosy picture.

Despite the apparent poor three-quarter figures, MOL management
maintains year end after-tax projections of Ft6-7bn will be achieved.
(All these figures are to Hungarian Accounting Regulations, HAR) Three-
quarter natural gas sales stood at 8bncm, 3.8bncm from domestic
production, and MOL projects 1995 domestic production will be up on the
business plan, with 1996 production down some 9-11% on 1995 figures.
Petrol sales were 13% up on 1994 nine-month figures, with diesel sales
similarly 6% up.

MC Securities report

However, a report by the London based MC Securities chastises MOL
management for not showing better financial nouse prior to
privatisation. "A profits downgrade so soon after privatisation is not
a good way to begin life as a private company," the report concludes,
saying the revisions to forecasts were "both unfortunate and quite
probably avoidable". The report still maintains, however, that MOL
"remains a fundamentally sound company," and forecast 1995 after tax
(according to International Standards, IAS) profits at Ft6.9bn, rising
to Ft21.5bn in 1996. MC Securities puts the poor three-quarter figures
down to a number of factors, but highlights that between privatisation
and the publication of the nine-month figures, provisions were made for
bad and doubtful debts of some Ft3bn. In addition, MOL's increasing its
volume of stored gas, with 275mcm injected into storage before the
winter season.

In spite of the marginal increase in domestic production, MC predicts a
3% increase in gas imports in 1995 to fulfil the increased storage
demand. Both the gas and the storage means higher incurred costs, and
the additional inventory losses are not an allowable provision for tax
purposes in Hungary, the report states. It is the above two factors
which raise the ire of MC Securities' analyst, since both were clearly
known in advance. The report downgrades MOL 1995 earnings on an IAS
basis to Ft6.9bn, "a significant reduction from the Ft10.2bn forecast
at the time of the international offering".

The report, whilst noting increased export sales, also debunks
Hungarian press reports of "considerably improved" domestic sales
figures for the first nine-months compared to 1994 results. It points
out that Hungarian sales "rose by less than inflation over the same
period, indicating MOL continues to lose market share slightly or faces
margin pressure in the domestic market". MC Securities notes a number
of hopeful signs, including the stabilisation in the former Yugoslavia,
which is likely to lead to improved MOL revenues. Its conclusions,
written on 4 January, state "MOL remains an attractive European oil
company at its current price of Ft1,220 per share".

Somebody must have done some reading. Later in the month the price hit
Ft1,945, although this was seen as something of a technically freak
price. By mid-month, the price was at a more sustainable Ft1,400 plus
level.

WORLD BANK ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE

According to the World Bank's first progress report on its work to
protect the environment in Central and Eastern Europe* "it was clear
from the start in the region that environmental improvements would be
linked to economic and social changes, and solving the priority
problems had to be balanced with resources availability".

As a result, the report notes, when the World Bank, the European
Commission, the OECD and the environment ministers of Central and
Eastern Europe endorsed an Environmental Action Programme for the 25
countries of the region at a meeting in Lucerne in 1993, it was agreed
that the Programme would be based on two premises.

The first is that all investments made in the field assume economic and
environmental policies are complementary and not competing (for
instance it is understood that phasing out subsidies is good for the
economy, conservation and pollution). The second premise is that in
order to narrow the range of what the most pressing environmental
concerns are, attention should be focused on just those priorities that
have human health consequences - namely lead pollution, and pollution
caused by airborne dust and sulphur dioxide, and drinking water
contamination. The report says these "priority problems" have now
"largely been identified", but a considerable amount of work remains to
be done to solve them.

As a member of the task force implementing the Environmental Action
Programme, the World Bank has contributed in a variety of ways. It has
helped 11 countries draw up national environmental data actions plans,
beginning with Bulgaria in 1991, and most recently assisting the Kyrgyz
Republic and Moldova. It has also helped governments develop
appropriate incentives and regulatory policies as part of the Bank's
$5.7bn structural adjustment lending programme between 1990-1995.

For instance, a $300m World Bank structural adjustment loan to Poland
helped liberalise coal prices which, together with a decline in
industrial production, reduced demand for coal, and increased it for
environmentally preferable fuels. This fuel switching, in turn, was
linked to a reduction in CO2 emissions and emissions of other air
pollutants.

The report notes that sometimes structural adjustment operations
include explicit environmental measures. For instance, a $15m credit
for the Kyrgyz Republic approved last year lays down that highly
polluting companies must do environmental audits and provides local
banks with guidelines on how to screen companies to find out if they
are eligible for sub-loan applications.

$1.36bn in loan commitments

Turning to project financing, the report says the Bank has made $1.3bn
in loan commitments for 12 projects in the region that are specifically
environmental since 1990. Of these 12, five are in the energy sector
and account for 70% of the total. All five were meant to mitigate
industrial or "brown" environmental problems like air pollution and
urban environmental problems.

Another of the projects was for improvements in general environmental
management (10% of the total), and another for emergency oil spills so
that the region has a response capability. This last category amounted
to $99m or 8% of total environment project financing, and was entirely
absorbed by one project - the Komi oil pipeline spill in Russia (EEE
42/7).

The Bank has also supported 27 general projects that include
environmental components. One of these is the Czech Power and
Environmental Improvement Project which requires that CEZ, the
principal generator, undertake actions that should result in a 90%
reduction in sulphur oxides and an 80% reduction in fly ash by the year
2000.

The World Bank is also supporting environmental improvements in its
capacity as an implementing agency of the Global Environment Facility
(GEF). In one case, the World Bank is helping Poland prepare its
ratification of the Framework Convention on Climate Change with a $25m
GEF grant that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, particularly
those of CO2. The project will help finance the conversion of small,
coal-fired boilers in old residential buildings. Local air quality is
expected to vastly improve as a result of the project with the almost
total elimination of SO2 and particulate emissions in towns, and a
significant reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides.

Meanwhile in regional programmes, at the request of the G-7, and
working with the IEA and the EBRD, the World Bank has prepared a study
on nuclear safety and electric power requirements in six countries -
Armenia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia and Ukraine. The report
is part of an ongoing effort to help the region develop long-term
energy strategies and ensure that safety issues and energy issues are
addressed in a coordinated way.

Patterns of pollution changing

Looking ahead, the report notes that patterns of pollution are changing
in the region. It says, "With an increase in the number of cars in the
region, and a decrease in heavy industrial production, traffic is
becoming a main cause of lead pollution, accounting for as much as 84%
of lead pollution in Hungary, 61% in Bulgaria and 40% in Poland".

Indeed the Bank is now financing research on projected traffic growth
in Central and Eastern Europe and on traffic emissions and their
effects on human health. It is also researching the feasibility and
cost of reducing the lead content in petrol. The results of this
research will influence decisions on future investments by the Bank in
the region. For instance, a comprehensive pollution abatement project
is being prepared for Bulgaria that includes measures to reduce
emissions from a copper smelter, to substitute coal fuel for natural
gas in urban areas, and to cut down on airborne lead emissions by
promoting the use of unleaded petrol.

Finally, the report says the Bank will be increasing its role as a
broker of deals, and agreements to finance environmental projects. "For
example, the World Bank can provide guarantees to mitigate specific
political risks in countries, and in this way encourage private
investments in support of the environment".

POLES RAISE PRICES

Domestic prices of electricity and gas rose by an average of 14% from
the beginning of this year, according to calculations by Poland's
finance ministry, but this figure covers a reasonably wide range of
individual tariff changes.

Thus, the price of one kWh under one industrial night tariff rose by
25%, from Z0.04 to Z0.05 (from 1.6 to two cents), while under another
it was up by 20% from Z0.05 to Z0.06 (from two to 2.4 cents). An all-
day industrial tariff showed a 12.5% rise from Z0.08 to Z0.09.

Domestic tariffs generally showed smaller rises, though the prices were
inevitably higher. Thus, the price of one kWh for households in blocks
of flats rose by 12.5% from Z0.16 to Z0.18, while the tariff for
electrical heating rose by 11% from Z0.18 to Z0.20 for peak rate and by
12.5% from Z0.08 to Z0.09 for the night rate.

At the same time, from the beginning of this year, users of communally
heated water will be charged on the basis of water meters counting
their consumption, where these exist. The public works ministry has
estimated that use of hot water drops by approximately half when meters
are installed.

HUNGARY SECURES 1996 SUPPLIES

Hungary has secured its gas and oil supply for 1996, Laszlo Pal,
chairman of Hungary's oil and gas monopoly MOL said on 11 January.

"Hungary's gas and oil supply for 1996 is already guaranteed, and we
are negotiating future deliveries," Pal told Reuters in an interview.
Hungary will buy seven billion cubic meters of gas from Russia this
year. "The contracts have been signed," Pal added. He said MOL had a
preliminary agreement with its Russian partner, Gazprom, which
guaranteed coverage of Hungary's gas needs until 2010. Talks have
already started covering the 2010-2015 period.

Pal said Hungary was presently getting all its gas from pipelines
directly from Russia, but a new pipeline connecting the western
Hungarian town Gyor with Austria's Baumgarten will open within the next
two years. Russian gas was also expected to be transported through the
new pipeline as it was cheaper than north European gas, Pal said. "As
long as our relations with Russian suppliers remain normal their
position will not be at risk," Pal added.

Hungary had preliminary agreements on all of its oil imports for this
year. "The contracts will be finalised within the next few days," Pal
said. The chairman declined to name Hungary's import partners but said
Russia would remain the main source, though oil has already arrived
through the Adria pipeline from Adriatic seaports. The mere existence
of the Adria pipeline had helped MOL to negotiate better terms with
Russia he added.

Hungary buys the Russian oil below the world market price at discount
levels similar to its neighbours, Pal said. Hungary's oil imports for
1996 will be 5.5mt (roughly equivalent to 110,000bbl/d), of which 1mt
are likely to arrive through the Adria pipeline. Hungary covers some
20% of its oil consumption from its own wells.

OILGATE ENQUIRY CLEARS MINISTER OF TRADE AND MOL CHAIRMAN

The enquiry conducted by the Hungarian Prime Minister's office into the
affair dubbed "Oilgate" by the Hungarian opposition found
"shortcomings" in various activities of the people and committees under
investigation, but no evidence or even suspicion of illegal activity
(EEE 51/17).

The announcement, on 22 December, appeared to clear industry minister
Imre Dunai, and his predecessor Laszlo Pal, now MOL President, of
allegations of conflict of interests and of using their positions to
benefit private businessmen close to their party who are involved in
oil trading activities. But parliament has decided that a cross-party
committee will also launch an enquiry into the matter.

The report says the goals of those concerned were correct, but there
had been "faults in implementation", because even the appearance of
wrongdoing should have been avoided. The stated goal of the report was
to establish whether personal relationships existed which would have in
any way prejudiced the interests of Hungary. The committee of enquiry
conducted hearings with Dunai, Pal and Otto Hujber, chairman of the
entrepreneur group within the Socialist Party and former head of a
committee in charge of an operation to repay Russian debt to Hungary.

In a nutshell, the report notes a number of points regarding conflict
of interest issues which involve Pal, Dunai and Hujber, and their
activities to reduce Russian debt and the trade imbalance between
Hungary and Russia involving bartered Hungarian goods. But critics say
the report generously judges the dubious aspects of these activities as
"shortcomings" rather than irregularities or illegal activity.

RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT APPROVES FUEL AND ENERGY PROGRAMME

A federal programme for fuel and energy development up to 2000 has been
approved by the Russian government. Officials noted that the fuel-and-
energy complex is responsible for a quarter of Russia's industrial
output and exercises considerable influence over the budget as well as
accounting for more than a half of Russia's export potential.

The first stage of the programme for 1992-1995 focused mainly on the
denationalisation of power plants. A new legal basis for market reforms
within the fuel-and-energy complex is being developed.

However many problems still remain, officials admitted. Only 40% of the
funds set aside for the programme have so far been made available and
non-payments difficulties are blocking progress. In 1995, only 1.5% of
the finance allocated to the sector was made available and outstanding
debts to sector enterprises increased 3.8 times over 1994 to R89,500bn.
These enterprises in turn owe R99,600bn.

Customers pay only for 23% of the gas received, 40% of coal and 60% of
electricity. The government has also set a three-week period for an
improvement in the federal programme for exports within the sector.

POLISH PARLIAMENT SENDS ENERGY LAWS FOR MORE STUDY

Poland's lower house of parliament on 11 January sent two draft laws on
energy production and sale, aimed at adjusting the sector to the market
economy, to committees for further study.

The bills, one prepared by the government and the other by a group of
deputies, envisage gradual liberalisation of energy prices, and provide
a legal framework for letting private investors buy into the industry.

The government-sponsored draft provides for creating an Energy
Regulation Office (URE) that would issue licences for energy
production, transmission, distribution and sales. The URE, together
with the anti-monopoly office, would also make sure that energy price
increases are justified. The bill proposed by the group of deputies
obliges energy producers to sign long-term contracts with end-users to
stabilise the market.

Under the drafts, the national grid is to remain state-owned, while
other energy companies could gradually be privatised to ensure much
needed investment. The grid will be obliged to connect to itself all
energy producers with URE licences.

The government-backed bill cedes control over the production and
distribution of heating from the industry ministry to the construction
ministry and local governors. Analysts said the parliamentary
committees were likely to merge the two draft laws into one bill in a
process that could last months.

WORLD BANK LAUNCHES $100M BOSNIA AID PLAN

The World Bank announced a $100m "Emergency Recovery Project" for
Bosnia in December to jump-start the war-shattered country's
restoration in the first quarter of 1996.

The money, to be co-financed between the Bank and other donors, will be
targeted at key government agencies, medium and small enterprises and
severely disadvantaged residents. The programme was announced in
Sarajevo by Michel Noel, chief of the Bank's country operations
division, as NATO activated its peace mission to bring 60,000 troops to
Bosnia.

Bosnian officials said they hoped the project would be part of a $517m
request they will be making at a donor conference in Brussels to
support the government in the first three months this year. That sum is
only a fraction of the total $5.1bn the World Bank estimates will be
needed reconstruction over the next three years (EEE 50/7).

Noel said that about $4bn of that had been projected for territory
administered by the Moslem-Croat Federation. The balance would go to
the Serb republic which makes up the remainder of the post-war Bosnian
state.

ENERGY PRIVATISATION FUND ESTABLISHED IN BULGARIA

At the end of December, 16 companies and 19 private investors in
Bulgaria registered a private energy privatisation fund with registered
capital of Lev10m.

The Energy Insurance company, Trade and Savings Bank, Risk Engineering,
7M Finance House and the two major national trade union amalgamations
are among the fund's shareholders. In a private capacity, leading
officials in the power industry are also shareholders of the fund. The
former director of the National Electricity Company, Dyanko Dobrev, has
been elected chairman of the governing board.

The managers of the fund have declared their intention to conduct
market studies in the companies from the energy sector included in the
government's mass privatisation lists, and to invest in at least seven
major companies. They will seek to attract the interest of the ordinary
investor to the energy sector, says Nikita Shervashidze, chairman of
the supervisory board of the fund.

Since it was constituted and until its court registration, the fund has
financed the privatisation evaluation of about 70 companies. Over
100,000 people are employed in the power industry or in related
industries, with their privatisation vouchers worth over Lev2.5bn.

BLACK SEA ENERGY CENTRE OPENS

The 11 countries surrounding the Black Sea region took a major step
towards energy sector cooperation last month with the official
inauguration of the EU-funded Black Sea Regional Energy Centre (BSREC)
in Bulgaria.

The opening of the Sofia-based Centre underlines the increasing
importance of the region as a key transit area for energy supplies
flowing westwards into Europe, while for Bulgaria, it marks a step
towards future accession to the European Union.

The Centre aims to coordinate the energy sector activities of the
member countries and to act as a focal point for inward investment to
the region. Multinational cooperation from EU financing institutions,
local banks and private enterprises is being sought for the first 12
projects. EU support totalling Ecu2.5m for the first 2-3 years is being
provided through three funding programmes - Synergy (Ecu1m), Phare
(Ecu1m) and Tacis (Ecu0.5m).

The Centre's creation stems from an EU-sponsored energy conference held
in 1994 which stressed the need for energy-sector cooperation between
the EU and the Black Sea region to "strengthen political and economic
stability and promote peace and greater prosperity in the region".
These aims have now been backed up by the European Energy Charter
Treaty to which all BSREC members have signed and which provides a
framework for energy trade, cooperation, investment and joint ventures
where no legislative support exists.

Plans for the Centre to be used by a Balkan's Task Force to investigate
oil and electricity interconnections in the region, and the "pivotal
role" they plan in energy interconnections between Asia and Europe,
were also announced at the inauguration. An EU Ministerial meeting is
planned for spring-1997 to examine the BSREC region's importance for
oil and gas transit from the Caspian Sea to EU.

FLOODS HIT ROMANIAN FACILITIES

Heavy flooding earlier this month caused extensive damage to low and
medium-tension overhead wires, natural gas pipeline and oilwells in
many parts of Romania. At Prahova, north of Bucharest on the main
Bucharest-Brasov road, a landslide severed the community's connection
to the main gas pipeline, with resulting gas leaks posing a severe
threat of blasts.

State company Romgaz said there was no stopgap solution and estimated
the broken pipe would take at least 20 days to repair. Several
communities in the area are currently without gas supply, while
consumers in Ploieste and Bucharest have been affected by lowered gas
pressure.

The floods, resulting from the sudden thawing of heavy snow, also
halted operations at eight oil wells in Olt County. Electricity lines
in several counties were severely damaged, cutting off supplies. Water
levels in hydroelectric plant reservoirs were up 3% to an average of
50.7% of total volume, with the highest rises reported in the east of
the country at Stejaru - 71% of total volume. The government has
submitted to parliament an amendment to the 1996 budget in order to
cover the cost of repairs.

RUSSIA'S 1995 CRUDE OUTPUT DOWN

Russia's 1995 crude oil output slipped 4% on 1994 levels, state
statistics committee figures showed on 16 January. Russia's total
output of crude oil and gas condensate in 1995 was 307mt, according to
the figures.

Russia's total crude oil exports to countries outside the Commonwealth
of Independent States were 96.04mt in 1995, up from 91.9mt in the
previous year, the committee also said. Of this total over 81.97mt were
exported by Russian oil companies, over 6.49mt by joint ventures and
7.2mt under government contracts. The largest exporters were Lukoil,
Surgutneftegaz and Yukos which accounted for 13.89mt, 8.66mt and 7.8mt
respectively.

The committee, whose figures were quoted by Interfax news agency, said
the total figure included Russia's state and commercial exports, as
well as Russian oil shipped through Kazakhstan on the way to non-ClS
destinations.

Interfax news agency quoted committee figures as saying that Russia's
total crude exports in 1995 were 122.3mt, a fall of 4.6% on the 1994
total. Crude exports to members of the CIS totalled 25.5mt according to
the figures. Committee figures also showed that Russia refined 183mt of
oil in 1995, which it said was 2% below 1994's level. Total oil product
exports fell to 45.3mt in 1995 compared to 47.3mt the previous year.
Natural gas output in 1995 was 595bncm, it said, also a 2% drop on
1994's level.

MOLDOVA COURTS CASH FOR OIL DRILLING AND EXPORT PORT

Moldova is courting foreign investors to help tap its crude reserves
and build an oil outlet to the West, a senior energy official said on
12 January.

Nikolai Chyorny, general director of Tiras-Petrol, the state oil
company, said that some oil from the project would eventually head for
European refineries, especially in Greece and Romania. "Both projects
are sure steps towards consolidating Moldova's economic independence,"
he said .

US Redeco Ltd won a 20-year concession last summer to begin drilling in
Moldova's southwestern Valeni oil field in the first quarter of 1996
(EEE 45/20). Chyorny said annual production from the venture could
reach 120,000t (roughly equivalent to an average 2,400bbl/d). Moldova
currently imports 98% of its crude and oil products. Moldova's known
oil reserves total an estimated 10.6mt, but the government hope
Redeco's exploration will lead to discovery of new reserves.

Terminal SA, a Moldovan-Greek joint venture, has said it will begin
construction of a $38m oil terminal with an annual capacity of 1.2mt on
southern Moldova's tiny Danube coast in Giurgiulesti later this year.
The terminal could berth oil tankers bound for the Black Sea and the
Mediterranean before the end of the year.

Chyorny said Redeco would invest $25m over each five year period of its
concession and give Moldova a portion of the crude extracted. Under the
terms of the deal, Moldova will receive 20% of the amount of oil
extracted each year for the first 10 years. Domestic annual consumption
has fallen to 2.5mt of oil from 4mt  a few years ago.

RUSSIA-CHINA ENERGY DEAL ATTRACTS MOSCOW'S ATTENTION

Moscow has hinted that a giant oil and gas deal with China could be in
the pipeline, but industry analysts said that Russia faced a long,
expensive road to tapping the world's fastest growing energy market.

Interfax news agency said on 29 December Russian President Boris
Yeltsin may sign an initial $8bn deal to supply China with Russian oil
and gas during a visit to Beijing next spring. The deal could
eventually involve building pipelines through some of Siberia's and
Mongolia's most remote areas.

Investment bank ING Barinas said in a report this month that Russia was
ideally positioned to meet Asia's energy needs. It said China, which
became a net oil importer in 1994, might need to meet 45% of its oil
needs through imports by 2010. "Russia in the long run is strategically
positioned to become one of the major, if not the major, supplier to
some of the Asian markets," said Craig Kennedy, senior consultant at
Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Moscow.

Interfax said the project could send oil and gas from the western
Siberian regions of Sakhalin, Irkutsk and Yakutsk to China and beyond.
The deal could include construction of pipelines going as far as
China's Pacific Coast, which could allow Russia to export oil to other
countries in Asia.

UKRAINE CONFIRMS RUSSIAN OIL FLOWING VIA DRUZHBA

A Ukrainian pipeline official confirmed on 10 January that limited
supplies of Russian crude had resumed flowing to the Czech Republic and
Slovakia through the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline.

"Oil started flowing to the Czech Republic and Slovakia on Tuesday
evening. We have been paid to transport 125,000t of oil to these
countries," said Lubomyr Bunyak, director of Ukraine's part of the
pipeline.

Oil supplies through the pipeline were suspended on 1 January because
of a transit tariff dispute between Ukraine and Russia. The Slovak firm
Transpetrol, operator of the pipeline in Slovakia, said on 10 January
that oil supplies had resumed to both countries.

Slovnaft officials have said they plan to refine some 420,000t of crude
in January and about 5mt in 1996. In 1995 the firm refined some 5.1mt
of crude. Bunyak added that Hungary had paid Ukraine to transport
511,000t of oil, which would take about 20 days. Supplies to Hungary
resumed on 4 January.

Bunyak said future oil supplies through the pipeline were uncertain and
depended on talks with Russia on new transport tariffs introduced by
Ukraine on 1 January. Russia says the unilateral tariff rise violated
terms of contracts between Russia's producers and consumers. Anatoly
Kovtun, a senior official of state committee on oil and gas, repeated
calls for Russia to discuss the tariffs.

Ukraine has said it will stand firm by its new tariffs. Yevhen Dovzhok,
head of the state committee on oil and gas, also said representatives
of Russia's Fuel and Energy ministry had agreed to meet their
counterparts in Kiev in the week beginning 15 January. Dovzhok said
that Ukraine had signed contracts with 28 Russian exporters to
transport 7mt of oil through the pipeline to customers in Central and
Eastern Europe.

"This is probably the lowest transit tariff in Europe," he said. "If we
didn't raise it, there would be no sense in transporting oil because
prices for land and electricity have increased. The new tariffs are not
aimed at quick profits".

Ukraine increased tariffs on 1 January to $5.20/t transported via
Ukraine's 715km stretch of the pipeline, from $4.73/t. Last year 17mt
of Russian crude passed through Ukraine's section of the pipeline,
Dovzhok said.

* Slovakia is negotiating with unspecified producers to import crude in
the hope of ending its complete dependence on Russian oil, Slovak
industry minister Jan Ducky said on 15 January. "We have been in
negotiations about the diversification of our oil supplies, either from
the Ingolstadt or Adria pipelines, but I do not expect oil to come from
sources other than the Druzhba, due to several reasons, in the near
future," Ducky told a news conference. He did not say with which
sources Slovakia was negotiating. Ducky said that the main obstacle to
diversifying was price. "One tonne of oil coming through the Adria
pipeline would be, due to transport fees, more expensive by about $14.
On the other hand, oil via the Ingolstadt pipeline would be more
expensive by about 20-30%," he added.

CZECHS AWAIT INGOLSTADT SUPPLIES

The Czech Republic should begin receiving some 140,000t of crude oil
through the Ingolstadt pipeline by the end of January, industry and
trade minister Vladimir Dlouhy said on 5 January.

Dlouhy said the Ingolstadt pipeline, linking the Czechs with the
Transalpine oil link in Germany, is currently being tested before
commercial opening in April. "The level of usage should range around
140,000t, or 170,000cm for January, and rise to around 300,000t in
February or the first half of March," Dlouhy told a news conference.

It is expected that the Czech Republic's two major refineries - Kaucuk
and Chemopetrol - will import 2-3mt of the country's annual consumption
of 7mt of crude oil through the new pipeline, ending virtually complete
dependence upon Russian supplies through the Friendship pipeline. That
supply has been subject to several interruptions including the most
recent which began on 8 January after an administrative row over
transport tariffs broke out between Russia and Ukraine (see separate
story).

RUSSIAN PIPELINES SPILL

Workers have brought under control Russia's third publicised oil spill
in as many months, limiting losses from a pipeline near the Urals city
of Perm to 200t of crude, the emergency situations ministry said on 12
January.

The pipeline, in the Tyoplaya Gora village 170km northeast of Perm,
burst on 11 January at midmorning local time after a bulldozer carrying
out work in the area slammed into it, ministry spokeswoman Tatyana
Timoshenkova said.

"There are no threats to the environment and the situation is under
control," she said, adding that the spilled crude had been pumped back
into the Surgut-Polotsk pipeline, which she said was now functioning
normally. In a separate incident, about 100t of oil spilled on 8
January from a pipeline near the southern town of Saratov, the ministry
said. Workers were still cleaning up the area.

In late December, 100-460t of crude spilled from a pipeline under the
Belaya River in Russia's southern Ural Mountains and mixed with water.
The spill has not contaminated the Volga river, Itar-Tass news agency
quoted a local official as saying. Ice and water hampered efforts to
determine how much oil leaked from the pipeline.

Interfax quoted Bashkortostan region's environment and emergencies
minister Rustem Khamitov as saying the accident was worse than reported
by pipeline officials, and that 620-630t of liquid containing 100-150t
of pure crude had been cleaned up by 8 January.

US COMPANY BACKS TALLINN PIPELINE

Coastal Corporation is backing the construction of an oil pipeline
linking the Tallinn port of Muuga with an oil depot located in the sea-
port town of Maardu, some 8km southwest of the Estonian capital,
economy ministry officials said 8 January.

The project is a joint venture between the state owned oil group Esoil
and Coastal Corporation. Financing from the venture, which will be
conducted by Esoil's subsidiary Termoil, will be supplied by the US
company via its Tallinn-based subsidiary Coastal Baltic Holding.

Economy ministry officials put the cost of the Muuga-Maardu pipeline
plan at between $18-20m. The pipeline will have a 1.2-1.5mt/yr
capacity, officials said. Under the plan, which was ratified by Esoil
and Coastal Corp in Tallinn on 14 December, the construction programme
will include a oil terminal, pipeline and oil tanks.

"We expect to have all the necessary approvals by the end of the month.
Working on this schedule, the pipeline, terminal and oil depot should
be in place and operating by year-end 1996" said an Esoil official.

MAZEIKAI HIRES US COMPANY AS FINANCIAL ADVISOR FOR MODERNISATION

Lithuania's Mazeikai refinery has recruited the US firm Public
Resources Infrastructure (PRI) as its financial adviser ahead of the
state oil company's plan to raise $110m from overseas banks to part
finance a $250m plant modernisation programme.

According to officials, PRI was selected following a competitive
international tender which drew 11 candidates from seven countries. PRI
is tasked with raising $110m in two tranches over a two year period.
The first loan tranche, to be raised from banks in Europe and the US in
1996, will amount to a $30m ten year loan. The second tranche, also a
10-year loan, will comprise $80m and be raised in 1997, officials said.

At least 40% of revenues generated from the first tranche will be used
to strengthen Mazeikai's working capital base. The second tranche will
go to supporting the company's investment programme. Mazeikai Nafta,
the refinery's operating company, has confirmed that the company is
engaged in talks with London-based Nomura Europe. According to Mazeikai
Nafta, the company is interested in "exploring and exploiting" the
potential of raising additional funds via an international bond issue.

Mazeikai Nafta was hit by more than 20 stoppages in 1995, caused by
both technical problems and breaks in supply from its Russian partner
Lukoil, which holds concessions for 60% of the refinery's 10.8mt/yr
capacity. Managers are eager to replace outdated technology, much of
which was installed in the early 1970s, with modern Western oil
handling and processing systems. The company is also anxious to switch
to cleaner technology, and increase its ability to process unleaded
petrol for the home and export market.

CZECH REFINER PAYS NO DIVIDEND

Czech oil refiner Chemopetrol Group will not pay a dividend on 1994
profits and is unlikely to pay a dividend until 1998 at the earliest,
company officials said at the end of December.

Company director Dusan Nepejchal said that on 29 December, shareholders
at an extraordinary shareholders's meeting had voted not to pay a
dividend on 1994 gross profit of K1.9bn. He said that shareholders had
also agreed to cooperate with the International Oil Consortium (IOC) in
Ceska Rafinerska (CR), which is to be created at the beginning of 1996.
The refining operations of Chemopetrol will be separated along with
those at Kaucuk to form CR.

A 49% stake in CR will go to IOC, the consortium comprising Royal
Dutch/Shell, Agip SpA and Conoco, which bought the shares for $173m
with an additional $480m in investment over the next five years
promised (EEE 50/23).

The remaining 51% stake will be held by Czech firm Unipetrol, a holding
of Chemopetrol, Kaucuk and petrol distributor Benzina. Chemopetrol
Group posted a K4.6bn crown gross profit for the January-November
period of which the firm's refining division accounted for more than
50%. The company expects its full year gross profit to reach K5bn. The
company intends to raise its basic capital up to K9bn next year.

SLOVAK REFINER PLANS MAINTENANCE

Slovak petrochemical group Slovnaft said on 8 January its planned
maintenance for 1996 is considerably greater than last year, but the
effect on the market would be negligible.

Slovnaft spokesman Lubomir Zitnan refused to reveal exact details of
the refineries' maintenance plans, but said delays of planned
maintenance helped the company's 1995 bottom line. "This year's
maintenance volume will be considerably higher, because it will also
include some of the 1995 maintenance plans, which we had put off for
the year 1996 and obtained a profit from (the delay)," Zitnan told
Reuters.

"We plan to refine approximately 5mt of crude oil in 1996, out of the
company's installed capacity of 7.2mt/yr," he said. Slovnaft's
preliminary 1995 total volume of refined crude was 5.1mt.

* Slovnaft said on 5 January it had posted preliminary full year 1995
pre-tax profit of SK3.5bn, the firm's best result in its century-long
existence. "We expect the final figures in a few weeks, but we can say
now the year 1995 was the best in Slovnaft's 100-year history," company
spokesman Lubomir Zitnan said. He added that profits were boosted by an
increase in refinery products retail sales and a year-on-year increase
in petrol sales of 100,000t. In 1994, Slovnaft recorded gross profit of
SK3.14bn and a net result of SK1.58bn on sales of SK28.94bn crowns. In
1995, sales firmed to SK32.0bn.

LATVIAN PETROL TAX TO FUND ROADS

Latvia's cash-strapped government has proposed increasing the excise
duty levied on petrol to fund a $1bn road and rail development
programme to begin mid-1996, the transport ministry said on 4 January.

The excise tax proposal was presented by the transport ministry to the
government on 21 December. The government hopes to rake in $20m/yr from
the increased tax plan.

The tax changes envisage a rise in gasoline and diesel related excise
duties of $0.4/t. This would lead to a 10% rise in the pump price on
petrol and 15% for diesel. Petrol pump prices would rise to $0.12/litre
and $0.8/litre in the case of diesel. "The tax will be of broad
advantage to all. The government plans to use 50% of taxes raised from
the scheme on road improvements. Latvia's roads are not in good repair,
and need new investment," said Vilnis Millers, deputy director of the
transport ministry's highways' department.

UKRAINE NAMES IMPORTERS

Ukraine has authorised three commercial importers to buy gas from
Russia's Gazprom this year as part of a sweeping plan to reduce the
state's role in energy supplies, Interfax-Ukraine news agency said on 9
January.

It quoted sources as saying the firms - Yedyni Energetychni Systemy,
Interhaz and Ukrazakordonnaftahaz - had signed contracts with Gazprom
to buy a total of 37.6bncm of Russian gas in 1996. The importers will
pay wholesale prices of $80 per 1,000 cubic metres. Ukrainian state gas
company Ukrhazprom, which until this year had a monopoly on all gas
supplies, will itself import 10bncm this year.

The government, burdened by non-payments for gas by domestic consumers,
resolved last year to ease the state's responsibility for gas supplies
from 1 January. Ukrhazprom will supply gas only to organisations
included in the state budget and for heating homes - about 30% of
Ukraine's total gas use.

Ukraine plans this year to import about 70bncm of gas - 50bncm from
Russia and the rest from Turkmenistan. Domestic output is forecast at
about 18bncm of gas. Ukraine last year imported 66bncm of gas - 53bncm
from Russia and 12bncm from Turkmenistan.

BULGARIAN/RUSSIAN GAS JOINT VENTURE ADMITS NEW SHAREHOLDERS

Topenergy, the Bulgarian/Russian joint stock company for exporting
Russian natural gas to the Balkans, changed its rules late on 11
January to open up to a wider range of stake holders.

"Now the formula of the company is ... an increase in the shareholders'
capital followed by the admittance of new shareholders," Gazprom's
representative in Topenergy, Bogdan Budzuljak said after the meeting.
Topenergy doubled its share capital to Lev120m in November (EEE 50/28).

Under the 11 January agreement, Gazprom will keep its planned 50% stake
and the other half will be distributed among Bulgarian participants.
These include a 25.1% government stake, down from an original 50%. Cash-
strapped Bulgargas could not raise the funds to buy the 50% stake.

Bulgarian government economic adviser Vladimir Zheglov said the
remaining stakes were distributed among the new shareholders who paid
for them on 8 January. They will assume full shareholder rights within
a week. Zheglov said the powerful business conglomerate Multigroup and
its gas arm Overgas Inc, which is half owned by Gazprom, will have
8.25% each. State-owned Bulbank and First Private Bank will have 3.2%
each and the private firm Himimport 2%.

"A three quarters majority will be needed for taking a decision for
liquidation of the company, while two thirds will be required for
increasing the capital," Zheglov said. Budzuljak said the Russian side
insisted on some easing of fiscal regulations, including taxation of
investments. "Otherwise we will need a long time to earn $300m, which
we must invest in the infrastructure, in widening the transiting gas
system, telecommunications, reconstructing the existing systems and the
compressor stations for regulating gas volumes," Budzuljak said.

Topenergy discussed its business programme, which includes the
registration of gas distribution centre for the Balkans, in Sofia
within a few months, Zheglov told reporters. "It will be the strongest
centre after the Russian one, which will distribute natural gas in four
directions - to Serbia, Macedonia, Greece and Turkey," he said.

LATVIJAS GAZE SIGNS 1996 AGREEMENT

Latvijas Gaze has signed a final agreement on procuring Russian gas
supplies covering 1996 with supplier Gazprom, officials of the Latvian
company said, describing the deal as a "good one for Latvia".

The deal follows four rounds of talks during the final quarter 1995,
which resulted in the signing in Riga on 17 December of a letter of
agreement, Latvijas Gaze said. Under the agreement reached, Latvia has
contracted to purchase 3.2bncm of gas at a price of $77.50 per 1,000cm,
2.95 cents per cubic meter more than the price of last year's supplies.

Latvijas Gaze's $16m debt to Gazprom proved a sticking point in pre-
agreement talks. An additional $5.2m in late payment penalties has been
added by the Russian supplier to the debt, which Latvijas Gaze has
agreed to repay in full during the first quarter of 1996.

The agreement will also permit Gazprom to use the Latvijas Gaze
operated Incukalns gas reservoir to store its gas, under a lease where
the Russian company will pay 5.90 cents per 1,000 cubic meters stored.
Currently, Incukalns stores 1.7bncm of Russian gas, and Gazprom plans
to increase this amount to around 2.5bncm by year-end, according to
Latvijas Gaze's CEO Adrians Davis.

Both sides also reached agreement on a transit price for natural gas
transit shipments via Latvia. Gazprom will pay a rate of 50cents per
100km.

The Latvian Privatization Agency (LPA), which has been tasked with semi-
privatising Latvijas Gaze, confirmed that Gazprom has "verbally agreed"
to acquire a stake in Latvijas Gaze when state shares come up for sale
during the first half of the year.

MOL GIVES RIGHTS TO OPERATE TRANSIT PIPELINE TO PANRUSGAZ

MOL is to transfer the rights to build and operate the Hungarian
section of the planned transit pipeline linking Russia with Italy to
the Hungarian-Russian joint venture Panrusgaz, which is effectively
held 50:50 by MOL and Gazprom. The agreement to transfer the rights was
made during a visit by Gazprom President Rem Vyakhirev on 9-10 January.

Vyakhirev told the daily Nepszabadsag the results of his trip were
"good, at any rate significant. These were extraordinarily important
negotiations. Many questions over our joint operations have been
accumulating over the past six months. The most important concerns the
joint construction of the Hungarian section of the transit pipeline."
He said a tri-partite agreement had been signed to the effect that MOL
and Panrusgaz should sign a contract by 20 March on guaranteed
quantities of Russian gas deliveries to Hungary until 2010 in exchange
for the pipeline cooperation rights.

A MOL source confirmed the accuracy of the report to EEE. Vyakhirev, in
response to a question regarding any Gazprom interest in the
privatisation of the Hungarian gas sector, said his company "as good as
it is, was unable to buy up all of Europe's gas industry. If
distribution is in reliable hands, that is favourable to us as
producers and suppliers." Regarding the possibility of barter deals, he
said "We haven't ruled out the idea. We need to keep working on this
theme. Panrusgaz will work on evaluating the opportunities."

The proposed route for the pipeline will cross into Hungary from
Slovakia and run though east and southern Hungary for an estimated 220-
230km before entering Slovenia.

NORWEGIAN DENIAL ON POLISH TALKS

The Norwegian state oil and gas company Statoil has said that there are
no negotiations between the Norwegian gas negotiating committee and
potential Polish buyers. The Norwegians added that they had not
received any bid to buy gas from Poland.

There had been suggestions that the completion of the NERTA pipeline
across northern Germany might bring Norwegian gas to within striking
distance of the Polish border, and that Poland could use this to
diversify its gas supplies (EEE 51/21).

According to an analysis by the newspaper Rzeczpospolita, access to the
NERTA pipeline would put Polish Oil and Gas (PGNiG) on the wrong side
of the battle in Germany between Ruhrgas (which owns the NERTA
pipeline), and Gazprom's allies around Wintershall. At the same time,
Gazprom and Wintershall are PGNiG's partners in Europolgaz, which is to
build the Polish section of the pipeline bringing gas from the Yamal
peninsula in Russia to the Midal-Stegal pipeline in Germany built by
Wintershall and Gazprom.

The newspaper further suggests that Wintershall and Gazprom may have
difficulty in selling all of the gas that they can pipe into Germany -
up to 57bncm/yr - unless third party access is introduced, or unless
Gazprom negotiates a suitable deal with Ruhrgas when the two companies'
existing agreement comes up for renewal in 2008. In these
circumstances, it suits Gazprom to sell gas to Poland.

RUSSIAN GAS DELIVERIES CAUSE PROBLEMS FOR BULGARIAN INDUSTRY

The pressure in the gas pipeline bringing natural gas from Russia to
Bulgaria, via Ukraine, Moldova and Romania, dropped sharply at the
beginning of January causing widespread failures and problems for
industry across Bulgaria. At the gas control and distribution centre in
Kardam, near the border with Romania, the pressure fell from 36-36.5atm
to 19-20atm on 2 January.

Similarly, the pressure of the second pipeline, transiting Russian gas
via Bulgaria to Turkey, also fell considerably. Large cities like
Plovdiv, Velingrad, Bourgas, Tirnovo, Vratsa, Razgrad and others were
receiving between 50% and three times less than the normal quantities
of gas.

The Neftochim refinery in Bourgas received gas at 12atm instead of the
normal 20atm pressure, while heat-supply companies across the country
experienced difficulties and were compelled to reduce heat supply to
customers.

Romanian, Ukrainian and Russian officials maintained there was no
interruptions or decreases of gas supplies, but industry minister
Kliment Vouchev pointed out that the pressure of Russian gas had
consistently been supplied at a reduced rate for several years during
the peak demand season.

UKRAINE BEGINS RESTRUCTURING

Following the dismissal of coal minister Viktor Poltavets in November
(EEE 51/23), Ukraine has wasted no time in beginning the restructuring
of its coal industry.

On 21 December the ministry's board meeting under the new minister,
Sergei Polyakov, decided to create 26 state-owned joint stock companies
based on existing mining and ore processing facilities and to establish
three state-owned mine-building companies on the basis of existing
combines. Shares in the new companies will be issued to a value
equivalent to the cost of the property of the businesses involved.

At least 51% of the shares will be held by the coal ministry.
Incorporation of these new companies will be approved by the anti-
monopolies committee and the economics ministry. The new joint stock
companies will be able to sell their products and draw up their own
investment policies.

Polyakov noted that much still needed to be done and the downward trend
of production was continuing. Only 77.1mt of coal were produced in the
first 11 months of 1995 - 15.6mt less than target and 9.9mt less than
in the same period of 1994. A review has also begun of wages in an
attempt to defuse growing tension over late payments and low production
rates.
* Ukraine is to increase imports of coal from Poland this year in an
attempt to reduce the power of the Ukrainian miners, according to the
ministry of foreign economic and trade relations. The Lvov railway in
western Ukraine is being modernised to cope with the extra load. It
brings in around 200 wagons of Polish coal a day and in the first six
months of last year handled 5.3mt compared with 2mt for the whole of
1994. This year Ukraine's imports of Polish coal are expected to total
15mt.

UKRAINE RECONNECTED TO RUSSIAN POWER GRID AFTER LEAK REPAIRS

Ukraine was reconnected to the Russian unified grid system on 18
December, two weeks after the link was severed by Moscow following a
surge in Ukrainian consumption due to the shutdown of Unit 1 at
Zaporozhye (EEE 51/24). On 3 January all six units at Zaporozhye were
operating for the first time since Unit 6 was commissioned last
October. Since then one or more of the reactors has been closed down
for routine maintenance or following an accident.

The disconnection on 4 December was caused by a leak of radioactive
steam. A remote controlled monitoring system has now been installed in
Unit 5 at the workstation of the ministry of environment and nuclear
safety. The system, was provided by the German environment ministry.
Reconnection to the Russian grid pushed current frequency up to 49.7Hz
in the day and 50Hz at night. It had dropped dangerously low to 49.2Hz
after disconnection. Ukraine's nuclear plants would all be
automatically disconnected if frequency drops below 49.15Hz.

Ukraine's other nuclear plants have also had problems. On 19 December
fire caused closure of Unit 1 at Khmelnitsky while Unit 3 at Rovno was
closed for maintenance on 28 December. Unit 3 at South Ukraine was
disconnected from the grid on 21 December due to a fault in the safety
control system and then had its capacity reduced on 1 January after
reconnection. The capacity of Units 1 and 2 had been reduced on 13
December following problems with the turbine cooling system.

UKRAINE RADIOACTIVE LEAK UNDETECTED

A radioactive leak at a Ukrainian nuclear power station which
contaminated a small area within the plant remained undetected for
weeks, an official at the plant said on 5 January.

Duty officer Vyacheslav Kruglov from the Southern Ukraine power plant
said that authorities had discovered the leak in a steam pipe at the
station's third reactor on 3 January. The reactor was shut down and
contaminated topsoil over an area of about 30 square metres collected
and buried.

The incident at the station, 350km south of Kiev, ranked one on the
international seven-point scale. Regulatory agencies said there was no
danger to local residents or the environment. "The leak of radioactive
water took place in mid-December, but on January 3 we found it and
cleaned it up. There was a hole in the pipe - the joint was poorly
soldered and the pipe was old," Kruglov said.

An official from the government nuclear regulatory agency said the
incident gave no cause for concern. "Such things happen at nuclear
stations. It's no reason for the world to worry," said the official,
who declined to be named.

POLES SET FOR ROWS OVER COAL PRICING

Poland's power generators have so far held off the mining companies'
demands for higher coal prices. In January, they are paying on the
basis of the much disputed "import equivalent" price of $32/t, written
into a long-term agreement signed towards the end of 1994. However, the
issue is far from settled and fresh arguments over the matter are
certain.

Essentially, the problem is that the mining companies assumed that the
zloty would continue to fall against the dollar, and that the agreement
would deliver ever higher zloty prices. The figure of $32/t was chosen
since it was reckoned that a higher price would enable the power
generators to import coal more cheaply; it was also reckoned, at the
time, to leave some profit for the coal miners.

The problems started towards the end of the third quarter last year,
when the effects of a firmer zloty, which had started to climb against
the dollar in the middle of last year, started to work through to the
pricing formula. The miners started asking for an average increase of
13% in coal prices (with some asking for up to 50%).

The power generators, meanwhile, want to stick to the long-term
agreement, especially as the electricity price increase scheduled for
this year is well below expected inflation. Of a planned rise of 14%,
the power generating industry will get just 9% - the rest being an
increase in value added tax - and inflation being forecast at 17% for
this year.

BELCHATOW CONSIDERS EXPANSION

The Belchatow power station and the Belchatow lignite mine are in
discussions with Polish industry minister Klemens Scierski and deputy
industry minister Herbert Gabrys about whether to build two  370 MW
generating blocksat the site, and whether to start an open cast lignite
mine at Szczerow.

The case for the two blocks is that from 2003 onwards, each year, two
out of the 12 generating blocks at Belchatow (with a capacity of 360 MW
each) are due to be closed down for refurbishing. This would coincide
with a time when Poland's energy demands are expected to be rising, so
the loss of the two blocks could hinder growth. Furthermore, Poland's
power requirements would continue to rise after 2010, so the additional
740 MW of capacity would not go amiss.

The new lignite mine - with estimated reserves of 700mt - would ensure
the viability of Belchatow until 2060. Without it, the site would
probably run out of lignite in 2016. The financing of the project will
depend on signing long-term power sale contracts with the grid company
Polskie Sieci Elektroenergetyczne SA (PSE) at appropriate prices. It is
here that the proposed project could run into difficulties since PSE is
examining several tens of applications for long-term power sales.

If the new project were to go ahead, the two new generating blocks
would be owned by a separate company in which the existing Elekrownia
Belchatow would be a shareholder, along with a strategic investor; they
would be expected to arrange the financing, and would need the power
sales contract to guarantee bank borrowings. The industry ministry is
said to have received offers from a number of Polish and foreign
companies willing to take a stake in the new project.

BULGARIA FORMULATES INVESTMENTS

The Bulgarian Committee on Power Engineering (CPE) has drafted an
investment programme for the period ending 1998 and presented it to the
government for approval. The programme is based on the government
strategy for the energy sector until 2020, approved late last year (EEE
50/9).

The total investments for this period planned by the CPE are 30% lower
than the ones provided for in the strategy (Lev31.362bn for 1996,
Lev29.75bn for 1997 and Lev21.797bn for 1998).

The CPE investment programme includes rehabilitating old units of the
Martisa Iztok 2 power engineering complex and the launch of Unit 8, as
well as the two units of the Chaira pump-storage water power system.
Investments to begin completing the second nuclear power plant in
Belene are also provided for. According to provisional estimates, the
investments required total $1.3bn.

CPE acting chairman Konstantin Roussinov says that in the past five
years investment in the sector (Lev7.5bn) has been at the expense of
reserves set aside earlier. If funds for building new capacities are
not increased, he warns, there will be a shortage of capacity in 1999,
and as early as 1998 there will be a shortage of electricity.

The situation is complicated by the unrealistically low amortisation
norms which were calculated on the basis of asset evaluation in 1992.
The sector is in danger of being completely decapitalised, Roussinov
warns. If the amortisation norms are raised, this could bring up to 30%
of the investments needed for the CPE programme with the rest financed
by government credits or subsidies, the official believes.

KRASNOYARSK SENDS POWER TO MONGOLIA VIA NEW LINK

Electricity is now being supplied to Mongolia's western districts from
Krasnoyarsk through a new transmission line via the shortest route
which crosses the territory of Tuva.

"The Mongolians built approximately 200km of a 110 kv power
transmission line, from the town of Ulangom to the border with Russia,
and we added another 50km to the line," said Yuri Ushenin, senior staff
member at the centre. "It took a little over a year to do the whole
job. However the start of energy exports should bring considerable
benefits for the people of Krasnoyarsk".

On the domestic market, 1.3 cents is charged per kWh, whereas Mongolia
pays the Russians for electricity at the world price of five cents. The
difference enables the Krasnoyarsk authorities to keep down the charges
for electricity for their customers". At present Mongolia consumes only
2 MW of energy, but demand is increasing and in some two or three
months it intends to increase imports by some 50%, Ushenin added.
* The Sibirenergo grid is about to commission a new high-voltage
transmission line, according to Samuel Zilberman, Sibirenergo deputy
director-general. A substation has already begun operating on the Itat-
Barnaul power transmission line, as a first step towards accomplishing
the major task of transmitting Siberia's surplus power to districts
experiencing shortages, he explained. This will mean the wider use in
future of electricity from a chain of hydro plants on the Angara and
the Yenisei rivers and from heat-and-power stations of the Kansk-
Achinsk fuel-and-power complex. Zilberman said that in 1995 more than 7
TWh was lost because Siberia's hydro plants are not yet able to
transmit power to the districts most in need.

RADET PLANS PIPE OVERHAUL

Bucharest heating utility Radet plans to invest Lev50bn this year in
the modernisation of its distribution system. The project, financed
with Lev40bn from Radet revenues and Lev10bn from the local government
budget, involves the replacement of battered pipes and the bringing
into service of new reservoirs.

By June the company hopes to have completed a Lev2.5bn upgrade of a
thermal plant supplying heat to the Bucharest Press Building. The plant
will be equipped with new meters and a computer system, Radet executive
Gheorghe Dabela said. The company also hopes to complete construction
of a pipeline from the Progresul plant to the Rahova area where many
householders are currently without heating facilities.

Also on Radet's schedule for 1995 is the modernisation of 25 thermal
stations, the installation of residential meters, and the replacement
of 1,000 heat exchangers and 100km of pipeline. The new pipes will be
fully insulated to cut down on heat loss during distribution. A more
extensive overhaul of its entire system, with potential financing from
the World Bank and the European Investment Bank (EIB), is currently
under consideration at Radet. According to Dabela, the EIB has
discussed the possibility of a loan up to $40m for the project which
would begin in 1997.

Gazprom has reduced gas prices to $50 per 1,000 cubic metres from $53,
the president of Belarus state company Beltopgaz Eduard Tofkinets said
earlier this month. Gazprom cut the price, which is linked to gas
transit through Belarus to central Europe, due to an increase in the
volume of gas being transported through the country and also because of
a customs union between the two countries, he said. "Thanks to
Gazprom's price cut and Beltopgaz's savings in transporting gas, the
government has decided to reduce gas prices for domestic consumers by
8.5% this month," he said. Tofkinets said Belarus owed Gazprom $562m as
of 1 January for gas imports.
