Singapore Buys Into U.S. Video Server Technology

The Republic of Singapore with 3.2 million population and a land area
smaller than New York City has emerged over the past decade as one of
the economic tigers of Asia. Already a powerhouse in electronics
manufacturing, Singapore seems destined to emerge as an important stop
on the information superhighway.

According to the World Competitiveness Report, which ranks the
economic strength of countries across eight categories, Singapore
ranked first in telecommunications infrastructure, largely because all
of Singapore's telephones are digital, and all of its telephone
exchanges are linked through optical fiber. All Singapore homes are
expected to be connected to fiber-optic cable by the year 2005. In
addition, about 99 percent of the Singapore population owns color
televisions; 84 percent own video cassette recorders; and four percent
own video laser-disc players.

And Singapore has also just launched a video-on-demand trial using ATM
and a Hewlett-Packard video server that will bring it firmly into the
21st Century. Initially, the system will cater to 300 households, of
which 20 will be completed in third quarter 1995 (first phase) and the
remaining 280 homes in fourth quarter 1995 (second phase). The total
contract amount for the Project will amount to about $9 million.

The HP Connection

The Singapore video-on-demand trial, which is being built and operated
by Singapore Telecom, will be using the same Hewlett-Packard
MediaStream Server video servers that are being used by Pacific
Telesis, BellSouth and SNET in the U.S.

Unlike some other video dialtone solutions, HP's MediaStream Server
video server is designed explicitly for interactive video services.
HP's video server is based on a new hardware architecture called the
"video transfer engine," which HP says is built for moving vast
quantities of video data across networks in a way that lowers the cost
of delivering each video stream to users. HP's video transfer engine
technology is scalable and modular, allowing interactive-television
providers to add capabilities to each video server and to connect
servers in a network as consumer and business demand for
interactive-television services grows. For example, a single HP video
server can be scaled to deliver from 75 to 10,000 video streams, and
when multiple servers are connected, millions of households and
businesses could use the network to receive video-on-demand.

Joining HP to provide technology and services for Singapore Telecom's
video-on-demand trial are Mitsui & Co. Limited as the consortium
leader; Fujitsu Limited of Tokyo, which will be system integrator and
supplier of ATM switches and network technology; and Philips Singapore
Pte Limited of the Netherlands, which will supply settop boxes.

Sybase in Singapore

The other major vendor involved in the Singapore trial is Sybase, Inc.
of Emeryville, Calif. HP will integrate Sybase's software to run on
the MediaStream Server product. Sybase's Intermedia architecture
software includes three products:

- Intermedia Server for control and integration

- Gain Momentum for multimedia authoring

- Gain Interplay for settop box integration.

The deal marks the company's first overseas agreement for Intermedia
and follows on the heels of announcements that Sybase software has
been chosen by SNET and Cox Cable for their interactive television
trials. In Singapore, the Sybase software will be used to author,
deliver and manage ITV applications and integrate these applications
with Singapore Telecom's back-end subscriber and accounting systems.
In addition to working with Singapore Telecom on the ITV trial, Sybase
is also providing the company with relational database management
software to manage key business applications at Singapore Telecom,
including the company's cellular billing system.

The Intermedia products, in conjunction with video processor hardware
and settop boxes provide a complete environment for authoring,
delivering, and managing interactive multimedia applications and
services. The Intermedia Server is based on Sybase's SQL Server RDBMS
technology and provides two critical components: control and message
integration. The control component stores and manages information
about multimedia data objects (such as names and locations of movies
or product descriptions). The message routing component provides
routing of requests to and from the various components (settop box,
video server, and back-end business systems for billing and
subscriptions).

Gain Momentum is an object-oriented multimedia authoring environment
"for developing visual, intuitive, and entertaining applications." In
addition, Gain Momentum can access and manipulate data from Sybase and
other databases, allowing customers to integrate multimedia
applications with their existing and future business systems. Gain
Interplay is a software tool that allows interactive multimedia
applications to be played on low-cost, small-memory, hardware devices
such as the television settop boxes and home personal computers that
will be used to access a variety of multimedia offerings. The Gain
Interplay product will be available on a variety of settop boxes,
including Phillips' CD-I, Scientific-Atlanta's PowerTV,
Hewlett-Packard's Kayak, as well as on Windows-based personal
computers.

Content and Beyond

The Singapore video-on-demand trial is part of a broad government
initiative called "IT 2000." The goal of IT 2000 is to build a
state-of-the-art, broadband communications infrastructure and
supporting services to further strengthen the competitiveness of the
Singapore economy and to improve its residents' quality of life.
Singapore Telecom's multimedia trial will offer a broad range of
content, including customized interactive news, home shopping,
interactive learning for children and adults, documentaries, movies
and sports.

Because the population is predominately English-speaking, Singapore
Telecom expects early programming for its interactive-television
service will be primarily in English.

In the trial, Singapore Telecom will offer interactive services such
as movies-on-demand, interactive news and education, as well as home
shopping.

U S West Announces Omaha Multimedia Trial Deployment Plans Following
FCC Action On Channel Allocation

Following the December 23, 1995 Federal Communication Commission
action approving U S West Communications' channel allocation proposal,
the company has announced plans to move forward with its interactive
multimedia trial in Omaha, site of the largest interactive multimedia
trial in the United States. The company said it intends to move
forward as soon as an FCC order is released.

The next step, according to Larry Levine, vice president and general
manager of U S West, is to notify the video content providers (VCPs)
who requested to participate in the trial as to the number of analog
channels each will receive as a result of the FCC's decision. The VCPs
who requested analog channel capacity in Omaha are: Interface
Communications Group, Inc.; U S West Broadband and Multimedia
Services; Cablewest Communications Corp.; MetroVision, Inc.; Henry W.
Harris; Cable Video Store; and The Knowledge Network of Greater Omaha.
USA Video Corporation and Telephone Video of America have requested
capacity on the digital video network only. U S West Broadband and
Multimedia Services group has requested only one analog channel which
it intends to use as a promotional channel.

"We expect the video content providers will convene in January to
select the programming which will appear on the shared analog
channels," said Levine. He said U S WEST will provide a facilitator to
assist in these deliberations, but will not itself participate in any
decisions concerning selection, pricing, or presentation of video
programming.  Levine said he expects this allocation process to take
60-90 days.

Following that process, all of the video content providers (also known
as "level 2s") can proceed with activities necessary to launch their
consumer offerings. U S West Communications' "level 2" organization
expects to begin a "friendly user" trial to homes of about 50
employees starting in late first quarter. Following successful
completion of its friendly user trial, U S West will make its services
available to customers in a market trial area of more than 40,000
homes. This is expected to start during second quarter 1995.

In other FCC action, the Commission dismissed without prejudice four
video dialtone applications for Albuquerque, N.M.; Colorado Springs,
Colo.; Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "While we are disappointed
with this action, we believe the fact they were dismissed without
prejudice is a positive sign," said Levine. "We intend to make the
necessary revisions and re-file them as soon as possible." U S West
Communications announced in February 1993 that it would build an
interactive multimedia network serving customers in its 14-state
region. Two months later, the company revealed plans for the technical
and market trials in Omaha. The suppliers for the Omaha technical
trial are Scientific-Atlanta, Inc. (video transmission components and
digital settop terminals); 3DO (settop terminal technology); Digital
Equipment Corp. (video server); New Century Communications
(subscriber-management software) and AT&T (telephony components).

Intelligence at Large Offers Expanded Functionality for Document
Conferencing

Intelligence at Large, Inc. has introduced BeingThere Sidebar, a
multimedia utility for video mail and document collaboration.
BeingThere Sidebar is currently bundled exclusively with the company's
BeingThere conferencing software, providing a sophisticated video mail
application at no extra cost. BeingThere Sidebar acts as an on screen
"conference table" for users to drag disparate information, such as
files, text, graphics or recorded audio and video. Once information is
on the table, users can display, resize, edit and synchronize it for
creating video mail, multimedia presentations and QuickTime movies.
Although feature-rich, BeingThere Sidebar provides an intuitive
interface, leveraging the drag-and-drop technique familiar to
Macintosh users.

In conjunction with the company's BeingThere 2.0 software, users can
share the information on the table with multiple users in
collaborative meetings and conferencing sessions. This feature works
even when the host Macintosh is unattended, so that remote users can
call at their convenience to access and share data. By providing
synchronized audio, video and text, users can easily create video mail
messages for efficient communications. In addition, users can send and
receive Sidebar audio, video, graphics and video presentations using
Apple's PowerTalk which is built into System 7.5. Intelligence at
Large recommends using System 7.5 on a Macintosh 68040 or Power
Macintosh with 8MB RAM for best performance.

Sun and Thomson Alliance Launches Open TV Interactive Multimedia
Environment

Open TV, an operating environment for interactive television, has been
introduced by the alliance between Sun Microsystems Inc. and Thomson
Consumer Electronics SA. This is the first product from the alliance,
presenting a platform-independent solution for delivering interactive
services to consumers. Demonstrated at the Consumer Electronics Show
(CES) were samples of applications the alliance expects will be built
by developers using Open TV technology, including ticket channel,
interactive advertising and video-on-demand. The Open TV environment
allows cable, telco, satellite, and other broadcast network operators
and content providers to download interactive applications to settop
decoders through existing networks. The applications then use the
return path of the settop box to provide full interactive
transactional capabilities.

Open TV is platform-independent, designed to run on a wide range of
settop systems and it can be deployed on broadcast or ATM switched
networks. The commitment to open systems is driven by the philosophy
of both Sun and Thomson to develop interfaces based on industry
standards and protocols. At CES, the alliance team demonstrated a
number of sample applications running in the Open TV environment on a
live digital interactive decoder. In the demonstrations, viewers were
alerted to the presence of Open TV interactivity by an on-screen icon.
Through the remote control, the viewer could make selections that
include requesting information, ordering products, or additional
services. The sample applications shown included:

- A ticket channel application demonstration begins with MTV-style
programming and then overlays interactive graphics, allowing the
viewer to choose and order tickets to musical events.

- The interactive advertising demonstration shows traditional,
currently running ads and then invites the consumer to request further
information or browse through a product catalog and order specific
products.

- An video-on-demand application provides a scrollable list of
available films and concerts. The viewer makes a choice, and the
selection is immediately downloaded to the television through the
digital interactive decoder. This application offers full VCR control,
including fast forward, rewind and pause.

- The alliance will also support a set of authoring tool solutions for
Open TV applications focused on speeding the development, production
and deployment of new interactive programs.

Microsoft to Use Mosaic

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) has announced that it has signed
an agreement with Spyglass Inc. to license Spyglass and National
Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) technology that includes
the widely accepted Mosaic multimedia software for browsing the
Internet's World Wide Web. Microsoft intends to enhance and integrate
the technology, including NCSA Mosaic-based browsing, into various
Microsoft products.

Microsoft disclosed in a related announcement today it will use this
enhanced browsing technology in combination with The Microsoft
Network, Microsoft's planned online service, to offer members of The
Microsoft Network seamless access to both World Wide Web sites and The
Microsoft Network content and services. Microsoft has formed a
strategic relationship with UUNET Technologies Inc. to build a new,
dedicated, global TCI/IP network so members of The Microsoft Network
can connect directly to the Internet. Microsoft is planning for this
new network capability and the browser software to be available by the
end of 1995.

"By choosing NCSA Mosaic as the basis for World Wide Web browsing
capability in future products, Microsoft is building on the de facto
standard for the Internet," said Mike Maples, executive vice president
of products at Microsoft.   "We have always believed in providing open
technologies for our customers and industry partners, and we want to
extend that belief by adopting Internet standards in our products."

Microsoft will work closely with the University of Illinois' NCSA in
helping to develop, use and create protocols for future Internet
technology. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign originally
licensed its Mosaic technology to Spyglass in 1994.

CableLabs Board Approves 1995 Budget

The Board of Directors of Cable Television Laboratories Inc. has
approved a $13.1 million budget for 1995 that authorizes CableLabs
management to raise the CableLabs staffing level to 61 positions.
There are now 50 staff members. The budget breakdown is as follows:
$9.5 million in operations; $2.9 million in the research and
development project pool; $700,000 for capital equipment. The project
pool is apportioned throughout the year for non-overhead projects.
Funding is based upon approval by the CableLabs project planning
process, which is open to all staff. The 1994 budget was about $12.6
million.

The Labs' two priorities in 1995 are providing members with
information about technologies that can enable cable operators to
enter into new businesses such as the telecommunications business, and
assisting members to deploy digital transmission and compression
technology.

To be added to CableLabs' employee complement are three unfilled
positions from 1994:  an engineer for radio frequency and digital
signal processing, a video and telephony engineer, and a vice
president for network architecture and design development. The new
positions are a membership services representative, a director of
operations engineering projects, two MPEG software engineers, three
administrative assistants, and a senior advisor.

Probita and General Instrument to Explore Level One Gateway Solutions

Probita Inc. and General Instrument Corporation have announced the
companies will work together to explore Level One Gateway solutions
for the management of connections in interactive video networks. The
Level One Gateway connects consumers with multiple information
providers by coordinating all elements of the Level One transport and
access networks. The two companies have agreed to leverage their
respective expertise in the development of the gateway for interactive
environments. The eventual system will, the companies said, manage
interaction among settop terminals, video servers, headends and
optical nodes on a real-time basis.

As multiple services come on-line, the Level One Gateway software will
control the switch fabric much like a telephony central office switch.
It will be a critical, 24-hour facility that must remain in continuous
operation while the network hardware, service definitions, and its own
software evolve through experience. Unlike central office switches,
however, the Level One Gateway will control a diverse distributed
switching system environment and support a variety of operator-defined
call models and applications.

"The architecture of the GI Level One Gateway will create an open
system usable in a multi-vendor environment," said Robert Lund,
director of network architectures and products for Probita. "It will
accommodate a wide range of subscribers on a variety of hardware
platform configurations. These two points appear to be of critical
importance to Level One operators."

Science Foundation (NSF) to develop new networking technologies for
use in science and math education. The $523,000 contract is part of
the NSF's Networking Infrastructures for Education (NIE) initiative,
which promotes the use of innovative technologies to improve
education.

BBN will use the funding to develop MuseNet, an interactive,
multimedia communications environment that is accessible
simultaneously by multiple users over a computer network. A primary
objective of the project is to design the network using an
organizational structure specifically intended for an educational
environment. MuseNet will support instructional interactions centered
on student work with scientific and mathematical "microworlds," which
include visual simulations, models, and computational capabilities.
Instructional programs
will be disperiment will measure the extent and depth of collaboration
among the participants.logy also will serve as a pilot facility for
investigating the technical and educational issues posed by
high-bandwidth networks.

The MuseNet project will include an educational experiment involving
an "Explorer Muse" on-line educational facility, which will foster
collaboration in developing science modeling activities. Teachers and
students from another BBN educational project, called the BBN
Community of Explorers, will participate. The experiment will measure
the extent and depth of collaboration among the participants.

In related work, BBN has been applying innovative technologies to
schools as part of the NSF's National School Network Testbed. The
Testbed encompasses a nationwide group of educators to advance
educational reform at the local, regional, and international levels by
using networks and other information services.
