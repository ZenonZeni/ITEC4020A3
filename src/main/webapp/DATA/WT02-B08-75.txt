<B>On behalf of the entire membership of the Collegium Internationale <BR>
Neuro-Psychopharmacologicum (C.I.N.P.), I want to extend to you a very warm
and enthusiastic invitation to join us at the XXth C.I.N.P. Congress in
Melbourne, Australia from June 23-27, 1996. The previous two C.I.N.P. congress
in Nice and Washington proved to be supurb international scientific events.
All of us in the XXth C.I.N.P. Congress are confident that the Melbourne
Congress can only build on this outstanding tradition and be a Congress
second to none!<BR>
<BR>
Graham Burrows, the Congress chairman, together with his Australian Colleagues,
have been working hard to ensure the finest accomodation and care for all
in attendance. The International Scientific Programme Committee and I have
selected a superlative scientific programme which will cover every relevant
aspect of clinical and basic neuropharmacology and neuroscience. The scientific
symposia in the programme are at the cutting edge of the field and are broadly
diversified, so that clinical scientists, basic scientists, and clinicians
alike, will find something of great interest.<BR>
<BR>
The venues selected for the conference are state-of-the-art and exceedingly
comfortable, and the Congress' location - Melbourne - is one of Australia's
most fascinating and unique cities. The proximity to New Zealand, the Outback,
the Great Barrier Reef, and many unusual and appealing places to see make
Melbourne an ideal starting place for pleasure trips and vacations. Numerous
interesting social events are planned that undoubtedly will be the catalyst
in enhancing old friendships and commencing many new ones, as well.<BR>
<BR>
In closing, I urge you to join your scientific colleagues from the world
over at the XXth C.I.N.P. Congress in Melbourne. I look forward to personally
greeting and welcoming you in Melbourne.</B>
