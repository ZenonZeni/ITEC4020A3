				LONDON, UK&#0151;Many regular lottery players are rethinking their strategy as recession blues lead into boom realism. Those who played lotto in harder financial times with the hope of landing an unbelievable jackpot at equally unbelievable odds are now seeing sense.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					During difficult financial times, lottery players look for big bucks at whatever odds. Now that almost all world-wide economies are recovering strongly, players are becoming more discerning.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Some world lotteries offer top jackpot odds of over 14 million to one. Such lotto games accumulate huge jackpots and rollover week after week raising expectation. But unfortunately for them their heyday appears to have arrived. Huge impossible-to-win jackpots are no longer essential for a good lottery as competitors favour games where they stand a chance of winning.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
					Ticket price has also become an issue to discerning lotto players everywhere. It cost only SFr 1 (about US 50 cents) to buy a chance to win with InterLotto. The good odds, low ticket prize and high jackpot produce an enticing competition, where you stand a realistic chance of becoming a millionaire with a single click of your mouse. With the added advantage that InterLotto is available on your desktop <a href=http://www.interlotto.li/cgi/hserver.exe?mainlot+serve=_mn_main+urlref=3300000852158>through the internet</a> there's no excuse not to have a go.
