<h1>STATEMENT OF MR. LEVINE,</h1>

<p><b>CHEMIST, BUREAU OF NARCOTICS.<br>
</b></p>

<hr>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MR. LEVINE: The Beam test seems to be the most widely used
chemical test for the identification of Marihuana, and was first
introduced by Dr. W. Beam, of the Wellcome Tropical Research
Laboratory, of Khartoum. The alkaline test in 1911 and the acid
Beam test in 1915 have come to be accepted as specific for
Marihuana, although a lot of samples have <br>
failed to respond. Workers in Europe and north Africa have used
it and tried it on a large <br>
number of plant materials. In general it is agreed that no other
material responds <br>
characteristically to the test.<br>
It has been attacked by some chemists, notably Trolle and Rende,
who said they obtained the Beam test on a mixture of drugs
consisting of ginger, coriander, licorice, nutmeg, and several
other things. Other workers, notably Fahamy and Keiy in Egypt,
and Papavassiliou and Liberato, in Greece, applied the test to
these materials, both individually and in the mixture, and failed
to get a positive response to any of them.<br>
As I stated before, a large number of authentic samples of
Marihuana failed to respond to the Beam test, or gave a very
slightly dirty purple color, which might be mistaken for just a <br>
dirty color. So a number of modifications of the Beam test have
been introduced to try to improve the results obtained in the
test. <br>
One of the steps taken to improve the test was the use of
adsorbent charcoal to remove chlorophyll from the solution of the
resin. This was reported independently by Fahamy and Keiy,
Bouquet, and by the Bureau of Narcotics Laboratory.<br>
One of the tests developed in the Bureau of Narcotics Laboratory
is the ethyl acetate test. Ethyl acetate is used as a solvent,
because it is a good solvent for the resin, it has a low boiling
point, hence is easily evaporated and it can be treated with
activated charcoal, which removes most of the chlorophyll, and
other substances, which would interfere with color development,
but takes out very little of the material responsible for the
Beam test.<br>
In carrying out the test, a sample of Marihuana is extracted with
a portion of ethyl acetate. The solvent is treated for a few
seconds with darco or norite and filtered.<br>
The filtrate is divided between two porcelain dishes and
evaporated on a steam bath before a fan. To one of the dishes is
added several drops of the alkaline Beam reagent, and to the <br>
other, several drops of the acid Beam reagent. In a large number
of tests, no samples which were negative to this modification
were found to be positive by the original Beam test, or any of <br>
a number of other modifications. It seems, therefore, that this
is the most satisfactory modification of the Beam test.<br>
Dr. Bouquet, in Tunis, has developed two amyl alcohol tests, one
of which uses charcoal, and the other does not. His test consists
of grinding a sample of Marihuana with potassium Hydroxide, and
then adding a portion of alcohol, mixing thoroughly, and
filtering, whereupon a purple color appears in the filtrate. <br>
Then, to a portion of this filtrate he adds about a ten-fold
volume of water, and extracts with one cc. of amyl alcohol. The
purple color is extracted into the amyl alcohol.<br>
In his test involving the use of charcoal, he adds a small amount
of animal charcoal to the mixture of the alcohol, KOH, and
Marihuana, presumably to remove chlorophyll, and then lets it
stand for two hours before filtering.<br>
<br>
The resultant filtrate is free of chlorophyll, and the tests
obtained are better. We have found that his test, involving the
use of charcoal, works better with activated charcoal, such as
norit or Darco than with the animal charcoal prescribed.<br>
Also, we find that we get results by filtering immediately after
the addition of charcoal, instead of letting the mixture stand
for two hours. We have not found any case of failure to respond
upon immediate filtration, which would respond after standing. <br>
Another modification which we have developed in our laboratory,
and which may be considered a modification of the Bouquet test,
is probably most convenient of the modifications to run, because
it involves the least manipulation. It consists merely of shaking
for a few seconds the sample of Marihuana with a two percent
alcoholic solution of potassium hydroxide. <br>
Add to this is an amount of activated charcoal equal in weight to
the Marihuana. The mixture is shaken for a few seconds, and
filtered immediately. The filtrate is purple and on dilution with
water, the purple colored substance may be extracted by amyl
alcohol. <br>
Other modifications of the technique have been proposed by Dr.
Myttanaere, Viehoever, Placencias and others.<br>
<br>
As I said before, a large number of plants fail to respond to any
of these modifications of the Beam tests. We have followed the
appearance of the Beam test in plants with regard to age, parts
of plant, and variety. In regard to age, some plants three inches
tall have been found to <br>
respond to the Beam test. Some plants, at all states of growth,
up to their decadence, respond.<br>
Many male plants, which are all withered, and consist of nothing
but a skeleton with a few dried flowers sticking to the top still
respond to the alkaline Beam test.<br>
As far as an individual plant goes, the order of response is best
in the top, both with the male and female plants, followed by the
upper leaves, lower leaves, upper twigs, upper stalk, lower
twigs, and lower stalk. In other words, as you go up towards the
top of the plant you get the best response.<br>
Where the top responds very strongly, you generally get a weak
response in the skin of the lower stalk. If the tops respond very
weakly, the upper leaves will probably be negative, or just give
a trace of response. We have never been able to get any response
at all from the pith or roots of the plant.<br>
<br>
This last summer we tested six varieties of hemp, as Dr. Robinson
indicated this morning. Three of them were Roumanian varieties;
one of them was Italian, one, Manchurian; and one of Chinese
origin. Of the three Roumanian varieties, about a percent could
be positively identified by the alkaline Beam test, as Dr.
Natchett pointed out this morning. The other three gave a trace
of response to the test. The Italian variety was very close to
this, having about 98 percent <br>
attainable by the Beam test. Of the Manchurian and Chinese, only
about 20 to 50 percent could be positively identified, and of
these, practically none of the tests were as strong as the tests
obtained from the Roumanian and Italian varieties. The largest
number of the plants were absolutely negative, or showed merely
faint trances of response, which we would not consider to be
suitable for identification if the plants were unknown.<br>
We studied the effect of heating the plants towards response to
the alkaline Beam test. We found that heating parts of the plant
at 100 degrees with air blowing over them for up to five hours
did not have any harmful effects on the material response for the
alkaline Beam test.<br>
In fact, some of the plants showed better response after heating
than before. Although some workers in Europe say in no case
should the extract be heated. over 50 degrees Centigrade.<br>
However, heating the plant at 150 degrees under the same
conditions did prove to have a deleterious effect. Another
treatment we tried was permitting the plant to mold. We subjected
the tops of some of the plants, both negative and positive, to
molding, in a very moist atmosphere, for a period of about five
weeks. After this period, the whole plant was covered with slimy
mold. Response to the alkaline Beam test was as good as it was
originally. <br>
Some negative plants which were molded remained negative after
the molding period.<br>
Oxidization is an essential part of the Beam test. Beam, in his
original article, pointed out that if the tests be applied in the
absence of air, a dirty brown color will result instead of the
purple color. We have taken up some of the resin in alcohol, and
added an equal volume of 2 per <br>
cent alcoholic KOH solution. The resultant solution was
colorless, but on passing oxygen through it, the characteristic
purple color developed. <br>
Shaking the solution with charcoal had the same effect.
Presumably this is because oxidization is effected by the oxygen
adsorbed on the charcoal. Oxidation must be done in alkaline
solution. Charcoal plays a dual role in the test. In the case of
the ethyl acetate test the effect is merely to <br>
remove extraneous matter, since no oxidation is effected in this
solution.<br>
In certain solvents, such as petroleum ether, the activated
charcoal will entirely remove from solution the material
responsible for the Beam test, while animal charcoal does this to
a much smaller extent. In fact, animal charcoal may be used in
petroleum ether, although its effect as a <br>
cleaning agent is not very large.<br>
The second role of charcoal is that of an oxidizing agent. The
oxygen adsorbed on activated charcoal is effective in producing
the necessary oxidation of the material responsible for the
alkaline Beam test. Animal charcoal is effective to a very much
smaller extent, and is <br>
therefore unsatisfactory for use in this process.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I think we will have a recess now for about five
minutes before we resume.<br>
<br>
(A short recess was taken, after which the proceedings were
resumed as follows:)<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Now, after that rather exhaustive treatise on the
Beam test, I would like to have Mr. Benjamin tell us something
about this so-called Duquenois test.<br>
The reason time is being given on these tests is this: Every so
often a new test is obtained, and this is the experience in every
phase of chemical activity, and until several months or years
have been put in on it, everyone gets highly enthusiastic about
it.<br>
Efforts are made to introduce it as witness material in court,
and the first thing you know you run into a situation where you
are yourself out on a peninsula and you can not possibly get
back. <br>
We have asked the Treasury Department not to employ any tests
unless they are absolutely tests on a theory of so-called
triangulation, so that when our men go to court to testify on a
seizure that their evidence is sound.<br>
<br>
Mr. Benjamin, will you tell us briefly about the Duquenois test
and what our experience has been with that.<br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: I think this was proposed in the early part of
1938. Reagent number 1 is an alcoholic solution with vanillin and
acetaldehyde. The second reagent is concentrated hydrochloric
acid; The technique consists of extracting hemp with petroleum
ether and <br>
driving off the solvent by heat.<br>
One then takes one cc. of the alcoholic reagent, adds it to the
residue, and into the solution thus prepared, puts two c.c.’s of
concentrated hydrochloric acid.<br>
There is a change in color from green to slate blue to violet
blue. Now, since we have had this, we have tested approximately
165 substances, including some of the alkaloids, the essential
oils, C. D. alcohols, everything I could get my hands on that
might show up with this reagent.<br>
So far, not one sample of hemp has failed to respond to this
test. When I say &quot;hemp&quot; I am referring to solid
extracts, fluid extracts, and ether available preparations. They
all show positive.<br>
Certain essential oils when treated by the test procedure ran
through the same changes as the hemp, namely, oil of bay, geranyl
acetate, rhodinyl acetate, and one or two others.<br>
There was also a compound known as Denol, that gave practically
the same reaction as hemp. That is used in C. D. alcohols. I do
not know exactly what it is composed of, but I think a mixture of
higher alcohols and ketones.<br>
<br>
MR. SCHICKTANZ: Yes, higher alcohols.<br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: I must emphasize the fact that not one sample of
Cannabis or fluid extract of Cannabis or solid extract has failed
so far.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Would you recommend the test as an eliminative test
for hemp; that is to say, hemp would have to give a positive test
of the Duquenois agent in order to be considered hemp, and then
proceed? <br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: Yes.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: To apply another test to see whether it is another
substance?<br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: I think the fact that ia the Duquenois test for
Cannabis fails to respond, then one should hesitate to call the
sample Cannabis.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: That is predicated---<br>
<br>
MR. BENJAMIN: (Interposing) On the 165. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Munch, you have had some experience with some
other tests, which we do not think very much of.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: That is fine. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: What is your experience with that test?<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: I started about three or four years ago with the
method developed by an official in the British pharmacopoeia for
ergot, using paradimethyl amino benzaldehyde. The results I
obtained I then dropped, because I got busy on something else,
but I have had occasion this last spring to review and finish up
that work, which was reported at Madison and the American
Pharmaceutical Association. The manuscript is in the hands of the
editor of the American <br>
Pharmaceutical Association, and ought to be out next month.<br>
In it I tried various modifications and found the 2-1/2 per cent
solution of paradimethyl amino benzaldehyde in 65 per cent
sulphuric acid, or in 65 per cent phosphoric acid, which is my
principal reagent. The material to be tested is shaken with 10
parts, or approximately 10 parts, of low boiling petroleum ether,
(below 40 degrees Centigrade) which has been redistilled and a
half part of Merck’s activated charcoal or norit, or any other
U. S. P., activated carbon for five or ten minutes, then
filtered. The filtrate is evaporated, and the reagent applied to
the residue. The direct application of the reagent causes
charring, or does not cause anything, according to how much
material has been removed. But on the addition of a drop of water
there is an immediate development of a blue color, shifting
toward the violet end of the spectrum, <br>
and disappearing within two seconds or two hours, depending on
how much material is present. <br>
Ergot gives a blue color similar to that of Cannabis, but the
color shift is toward the red. The red is much slower than with
that of Cannabis, and it persists for several days.<br>
I went to two neighborhood drug stores, and got ten or eleven
materials out of their prescription department, and sent them
through the same tests. Many of them gave no color. Others gave
colors of some sort. But, to make a long story short, none of
them gave the same type of <br>
color as the blue shift that I obtained with Cannabis. I have
tried about 50 samples of Cannabis, so far, and every one of
those gave the same reaction. <br>
While my eye is not too good, still there is a symmetric trend
between the potency on dogs and the degree of color developed
here. By degree I mean intensity and duration, considering them
together. But a product stronger on the dog has given me a
stronger color. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Matchett, what is your experience with that
Ghamrawy test? <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: We found too many other substances, which we regard
as giving colors too similar to that given to Cannabis, to have
any value in the hands [of] anyone not very definitely expert in
the use of it. Even in such hands it is our judgment that colors
given tobacco and certain other substances were still too near
the color given by Cannabis for use in the case of extracts. Of
course, where we have a plant to look at, we realize a different
situation exists.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Even with tobacco? <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Tobacco was very close. <br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Is that right? <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: This was not used with charcoal. <br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: If I do not use charcoal, I get inconclusive results
along that line. <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: I am coming 'to that. It was our experience that
the U.S.P. activated charcoal would remove either the hemp or
tobacco test substance from petroleum ether. The result being
that the test in hemp was about the same as it was in tobacco. I
will ask Mr. Benjamin if that is a correct statement.<br>
</p>

<p>MR. BENJAMIN: That is correct. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Lancaster, have you had any experience with
these tests in Canada?<br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: Yes, Dr. [sic] Wollner. Some years ago our
interest was aroused as to whether or not Canadian Cannabis would
be at all active. As some of you know, the plant <br>
thrives in all climates. We have it in all altitudes. There are
no cultivated plants. But some years ago we wanted to satisfy
ourselves about the activity of the Canadian produced Cannabis.
Some was grown in western Canada for windbreak purposes, that is
the only economic function it had with us. After applying the
alkaline Beam test, as put out from Geneva we obtained positive
reactions, and the pharmacologists tried it on dogs and we found
it responded, so we concluded that some of the Canadian Cannabis
was active.<br>
From the standpoint of the administration of the Narcotic Act,
our interest is entirely limited to the illicit traffic, and it
is confined to the reefer or cigarette, where we have the
advantage of a physical. diagnosis, rather than chemical.<br>
The chemical work on this we intend to follow up as of extreme
importance, because it is difficult to predict to what extent the
extracts may come into use. There is a possibility of developing
a non-reactive type of plant, but it is not of an immediate
concern, although there again conditions of world trade and
combined complications might become such that Canada might be
asked to take up that problem again. Who knows?<br>
So we can not afford to lose interest in these chemical phases of
the testing.<br>
<br>
Our experience with the Beam test has been that it is somewhat
erratic, and does not always give the equivalent results in the
hands of different operators, for some reason. Of course, there
again, we have run some of our tests on plants where we know we
have had them in storage for some years. It is rather puzzling
there is no reaction there.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: No reaction? <br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: On prolonged storage. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Under what conditions was that hemp stored? <br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: In a large glass stopped bottle. However, we have
to check that again, because of the results of this vegetation
which remained an open field, which is another puzzle.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: That is where we all find ourselves at the moment.
What I would like to hear from the group is something in the way
of suggestions as to how this problem can be most competently
attacked. What is to be done? The problem is not a simple one,
although there is no indication as to its complexity. I say it is
not a simple problem, because if material has not been advanced
after several thousand years of experience there must be some
barrier there. <br>
Is there any technique which should be considered which has not
been considered?<br>
Dr. Hibben, have you any suggestions along this line?<br>
</p>

<p>DR. HIBBEN: That is rather a difficult question. I think we
are proceeding correctly.<br>
I think the first thing that has to be done is developing an
adequate method for determining the content of the active
principle, and until such a method is developed, there is not
going to be very much room for improvement.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The only difficulty has been that this problem has
been very much the problem of peeling an onion--the more you
peel, apparently the more peels you can take off, until you peel
away the onion and then there is nothing left.<br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: That is quite true. But I do not think there has been
any comprehensive, systematic work done on the problem, by an
adequate chemical staff, under adequate direction.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: The first thing seems to be to find the active
principle. That is a different proposition.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Has any work been done on the chlorophyl of the leaf? <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: All the work we know of is what you have done.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: The only thought I have is, if the chlorophyll of
Marihuana happens to be different from all other chlorophylls in
the universe, it can be identified microscopically.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Hibben, you have run some microscopic tests on
Cannabis direct for the chlorophyll. <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: I did not look for chlorophyll. I say that is very
desirable, but I say they would be very doubtful on the
chlorophyll alone. <br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: Of course, there are some points about that. <br>
<br>
MR. VALAER: The chemistry of opium was very uncertain for a long,
long time. We had a crude mass to work with, and gradually they
pulled out one hundred pieces or more. I believe, after all, we
have not been interested in this more than about two years. I
believe the chemical crude resin Marihuana will work out in the
same way. We have two stills upstairs. We have a good many people
working on it in extracts and various ways, even now in this
brief time.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Dr. Couch, do you have anything to offer?<br>
<br>
DR. COUCH: I would like to say that this problem is in no more
desperate condition than a great many other problems in which a
solution has not been reached. They all present this picture
before the real work is done in solving it which makes it all
seem extremely baffling. <br>
It is very curious that by plugging along and keeping infernally
at it, that one of these days the problem is solved almost before
it is realized, and it seems to me that the lines that have been
projected here and the lines that have been followed are exactly
those that should be followed, and will, in the course of time,
lead to the solution of the problem; I mean the information that
you desire to have. There is one thing that occurs to me that has
not been mentioned, and <br>
that is if any work has been done upon the smoke from Marihuana,
as the smoke is physiologically active. <br>
It may be different from the resin taken by mouth or injected
into the veins. That is another matter. But it seems to me that
there is something there that might be developed as a test for
identity.<br>
<br>
MR. SMITH: I think Dr. Hershfield did something on that
chlorophyll work which he did two years ago.<br>
<br>
DR. COUCH: Of course, along that line is also the possibility of
reaction from the protein. It simply rests on the possibility and
probability that that is, of course, the leafy tissue, and the
extract probably would not serve.<br>
The leafy portion would contain some protein. That with a water
extract or salt extract of the plant itself, in a very short time
would get positive results, one away or the other. The difficulty
there is there may be present some protein that is also present
in another plant. That difficulty arises, but the precipitation
reactions are amazingly specific and amazingly direct. When one
goes from one animal tissue to another he has to wash his hands
extremely carefully as he changes over from one to another, so as
not to spoil the test in the next tissue. There is that sort of
delicacy. I simply offer that as a test. I presume there has
already been a lot of thought discounted on that subject.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: I do not know of that test. Dr. Loewe? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: If I may bring up the encroachment which is in doubt,
it has been known thousands and thousands of years that sex cells
contain an active principle. However, it has taken up to this
century to get hold of those active principles, and the reason
was not the difficulty with respect to chemistry, but the
difficulty was that there was no test for the active principle
only as an active principle, and no chemical tests were given.<br>
This is the same situation in Cannabis with one exception, and we
know the physiological test for the active principle is given. It
is much more easily accessible. This biological test is much more
easily accessible, so there is a test, and the thing which has
not yet been done, at least not <br>
yet systematically enough, is to dovetail the identification of
the active principle by its active nature by a biological test. I
think this specific picture of the dovetail work gives
immediately <br>
the solution, unless somebody is inclined to drop the whole
thing. But I again remember that same situation in the female
hormone and the male hormone, which involves just this one
property to give a beautiful color reaction. However, it did not
take more than five years after finding the right test and using
the right test in the right way from the first isolation of the
principle. I think this is the way prescribed.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Do you know of any experiments, Dr. Loewe, that have
been performed on the smoke itself? <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: No.<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: I know of where they took the Marihuana smoke and
passed it through solvents.<br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: Through chloroform? <br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: No, through water. <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE Water, rather than chloroform?<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: Yes.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: There is a great deal of work being done
at the present time with respect to the use of opium smoke. A
paper has just been prepared by someone in a laboratory in
London, which has just been issued. Are you familiar with Dr.
Nicholls? <br>
<br>
MR. LANCASTER: Yes, Dr. Nicholls was mentioned in connection with
the research today.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Is that the same Nicholls who is on the
Opium Assay Committee?<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: I was going to say very much the same thing as Dr.
Loewe said; that is, that I can not see any reason for being
discouraged as far as chemistry is concerned. Now, you have got a
perfectly good point of attack. The amazing thing about this
whole problem is that nothing has been done with the exception of
this one matter in 1932, when it was established that crude
Cannabinol behaves like a pure substance, and the customary high
vacuum distillation technique fails to separate it into its
constituents. The work has been apparently dropped from that time
on. The surprising thing is that someone has not jumped into
that. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Of course, there has been no commercial demand in
that respect, .and that is one of the reasons for that.<br>
<br>
DR. BLATT: It is difficult to get hold of the material. <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: If you want to get something on spectroscopic
methods, when these chemists leave the point where there are
spectroscopic methods for determination and for determining the
structure, they would aid greatly in facilitating this problem.<br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: It would aid greatly.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: We would like to ask Dr. Hibben if there are not
some such methods which may be correlated to the bioassay? The
essential or volatile oils come out of this material very
readily. It can be narrowed down to relatively few compounds. If
we knew, separately, the spectra of these various materials,
would it not help to follow the separations at that stage of
operations? <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: Yes, I think it would. You can start in by that
procedure on hormones.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: And I believe also carotenoids. <br>
<br>
DR. HIBBEN: Yes.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: As the fractionation goes further and further, the
number of bioassays increases almost without limit, and that is
one reason we were particularly interested in it. Also, the
quantitative phase has to be considered. <br>
<br>
DR. LOEWE: But, as an economic matter, and the rational method is
to proceed in an economical way, which can be done by carefully
choosing fractions to test.<br>
<br>
DR. MATCHETT: I do not believe we could quarrel about that.<br>
<br>
DR. MUNCH: Doctor, there is the other thought, and that is that
we have not been picking on any of the prisoners lately.<br>
<br>
COMMISSIONER ANSLINGER: Doctor, we are not dealing with the same
problem as opium, where we can take the addict to a hospital at
Lexington and go through all of the experiments. There is a
little danger that this drug might affect a man permanently. He
might do something which we may be sorry for later. I think that
must be given serious thought.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: Dr. Wollner, I will not be very long now, but I just
want to clarify a point, and it would seem from reports and other
information that the tests are rather indicative of hemp rather
than of the active principle.<br>
<br>
I am saying that for this reason: We would like to be in a
position to approach the development of strains that were free
from the active principle, Now, until we have a test it seems to
be that we can not do anything. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: Yes, and no.<br>
<br>
DR. WRIGHT: I will say it is possible that one of these tests may
be useful from a breeding standpoint, but it seems to me it is
working entirely on a guess, It would seem to me that any
approach would be resolving the strains in pure breeding alone.
In other words, approach the inbreeding situation in a hybrid
manner; that is the approach we want, but it would seem to me
that all we could do at this state would be to develop those
lines at random.<br>
<br>
In other words, set up as many facilities as we could for pure
breeding lines. Any individual plant that would be tested would
be very indefinite as to what its progeny would be, and it would
seem to me that that is more or less a blind approach; shall I
say a lick in the dark; and we would have to develop as many as
we could. We can do that, develop as many lines as possible, like
in Prussic acid in Sudan grass.<br>
</p>

<p>My point is, and I am mentioning it to you chemists, that we
can get nowhere without a test of consequence. We might be lucky.
About ten thousand chances to one, we might be lucky until we
have a test. <br>
<br>
MR. WOLLNER: In the last analysis, you are unquestionably correct
about that. Really, before significant progress can be made by
the agricultural people, we will have to provide you with a
formula. Before we adjourn, I would like to invite any of the
visiting friends present to come upstairs for a few minutes and
see our laboratory set-up for tackling this job, the molecular
stills, and extraction equipment, and I am quite sure you will
enjoy it. <br>
<br>
And I want to really express my appreciation and thanks for your
kind cooperation in helping to clarify these issues.<br>
<br>
(Whereupon, at 5:10 o'clock p.m., the Conference was adjourned
sine die.) </p>
