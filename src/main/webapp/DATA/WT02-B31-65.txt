<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>CD vs. Deferred Annuity</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Which Best Meets Your Needs?</STRONG><BR>
They're both quality financial tools. If you're debating whether the best place for
your
money is a
certificate of deposit (CD) or deferred annuity, the answer depends upon your
individual
financial
situation and investment objectives.
<P>
Both CDs and deferred annuities are savings vehicles used by individuals to
accumulate
wealth.
However, these two products are quite different; each has its own unique strengths
and uses.
For the
sake of comparison, let's look at two similar versions of these products - an
individually
owned,
non-tax qualified bank CD and an individually owned, non-tax qualified single
premium
deferred annuity
earning an annually renewable fixed rate of return. Review the list of objectives
and
identify those which
are most important to you. This will help determine which of these two products -
CD or
deferred
annuity - is best suited for your needs at this time.
<P>
<STRONG>Objectives</STRONG>
<P>
<STRONG>Safety of Principal:</STRONG> Both CDs and deferred annuities are
considered low-risk
investments. CDs are
generally issued by banks and, in most cases, are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) for up to $100,000 per depositor. Should the bank fail, the
FDIC
guarantees CDs up
to this amount.<P>
Deferred annuities, on the other hand, are issued by insurance companies and are
not insured
by the
U.S. government. They are backed in their entirety by the financial strength of the
issuing
insurance
company, regardless of the amount. Before purchasing an annuity however, you should
make sure
the
issuing insurance company is financially sound. You can determine financial
stability by
requesting the
findings of independent rating companies such as Moody's, A.M. Best, Standard &amp;
Poor's and
Duff &amp; Phelps.
<P>
<STRONG>Short-Term Accumulation: </STRONG>When deciding between a CD and a
deferred
annuity, your investment
horizon should be a key factor. Your investment horizon is the amount of time you
need to
save for a
specific goal. For short-term goals, such as a down payment on a home, a new car or
a
vacation, a CD
may prove to be a better choice for you. In most instances, you can select a
maturity date
for your CD
that corresponds to your time horizon. Maturity periods can be as short as one
month or as
long as
several years. 
<P>
<STRONG>Long-Term Accumulation:</STRONG> On the other hand, a deferred annuity is
generally
the product of choice for
the long haul. Deferred annuities are designed to help accumulate money for
retirement or to
protect
funds already saved up once you've reached retirement. They can even be used to
provide a
legacy for
your heirs. In later years, a deferred annuity also provides more flexibility for
accessing
your money.
<P>
<STRONG>Interest Return:</STRONG> CDs offer a guaranteed rate of return for a
specified
period of
time. Interest rates will
vary depending on current market conditions and the length of time to maturity.
Generally,
the shorter
the period of time to maturity, the lower the rate. There is no guaranteed minimum
for
renewal rates.
With a deferred annuity, a guaranteed interest rate is locked in for an initial
period,
usually one to three
years. After that, interest rates may be adjusted periodically, generally each
year. Because
annuities are
long-term vehicles, their interest rates tend to be higher than comparable CDs.<P>
Deferred annuities also offer a guaranteed minimum interest rate. Regardless of
market
conditions, the
annuity will pay at least the minimum guaranteed rate established at the time of
purchase. In
addition,
some companies offer a "bailout" rate to protect against excessive year-to-year
rate
fluctuations. 
<P>
<STRONG>Tax Savings:</STRONG> If taxes are a concern, a deferred annuity may be a
better
option
for several reasons:
<P>
Earnings on CDs are taxable in the year the interest is earned even if you don't
take the
money out. With
deferred annuities, on the other hand, earnings accumulate free of current
taxation. Earnings
inside an
annuity are not treated as taxable income until they are withdrawn. This allows
more of your
money to
work harder towards achieving your long-term goals and gives you a measure of
control over
when you
pay taxes and how much you pay. This tax deferral feature is one of the greatest
advantages
of deferred
annuities.
<P>
As you can see from the chart below, when saving for the long term it makes good
investment
sense to
have the power of tax deferral on your side. Keep in mind that withdrawals from the
earnings
portion of a
deferred annuity are taxable and, if you're under age 59 1/2, these earnings may be
subject
to a 10% tax
penalty. 
<P>

and/or charges.</FONT><BR>

<P>
Deferred annuities may also help reduce or eliminate the taxes on your Social
Security
benefits. By
leaving your money in a deferred annuity you can reduce your taxable income,
keeping it below
the level
where you would begin to owe taxes on your Social Security benefits. But with CDs,
your
interest
earnings count in the calculation to determine how much of your Social Security
benefits will
be taxed -
even if you don't withdraw the earnings. As much as 85% of your Social Security
benefits
could end up
subject to taxation.
<P>
At death, the annuity's account value will be paid directly to your named
beneficiary(ies),
avoiding the
costs and delays associated with the probate process. This is not the case with a
CD, which
is
included in your estate. When purchasing a deferred annuity, look for one that
distributes
the full
account value to beneficiaries. Some companies apply surrender charges on death
benefit
proceeds.
<P>
<STRONG>Liquidity:</STRONG> If you need access to the funds in a CD prior to the
maturity
date, you
may pay an interest
penalty ranging from 30 days' to six months' interest. Of course, you can limit
your exposure
to
surrender penalties by investing in several CDs with staggered maturity dates.<BR>
A deferred annuity also provides you with access to funds should the need arise.
Most
companies will
give you the flexibility to withdraw a portion of your deferred annuity's account
value,
usually 10% each
year, without a company-imposed surrender charge. Withdrawals from deferred
annuities can be
made
in response to a one time cash need or set up systematically to respond to a
continuous need.
In fact,
most deferred annuities offer the opportunity to systematically withdraw funds on a
monthly,
quarterly,
semi-annual or annual basis.<P>
Keep in  mind that deferred annuities are designed to build your retirement nest
egg.
Withdrawals of
earnings prior to age 59 1/2 may be subject to a 10% penalty tax. Plus, most
insurers assess
a
surrender charge if the contract is terminated during the first several years.<P>

<STRONG>Distribution Options at Maturity:</STRONG> When a CD reaches its maturity,
you can
take
the CD's lump sum value
in cash, renew the CD for the same or different maturity period or examine other
investment
alternatives
(such as a deferred annuity).<P>
In a deferred annuity you may elect to withdraw your money in a lump sum or you may
want to
select a
lifetime income option, which will provide you with a consistent flow of income
that you
cannot outlive.
Or, you can simply elect to let your funds accumulate until a need arises.<P>
These are just a few of the factors to consider when making your selection between
a CD and a
deferred annuity. Depending upon your investment horizon, you may want to allocate
a portion
of funds
to a CD to cover short-term needs and a portion to a deferred annuity for the long
term.<P>
