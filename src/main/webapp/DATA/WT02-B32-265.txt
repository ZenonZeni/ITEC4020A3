NewsNet information on target for <BR>
Ballistic Missile Defense Information Center</H2><BR CLEAR=ALL>


"I don't know what we would do without NewsNet," according to Jim Tilton, senior information specialist and founder of BMD (Ballistic Missile Defense) Technical Information Center, located in Arlington, Virginia.   Jim knows the importance of getting current information quickly when it's needed.<P>

Jim has been a NewsNet user since 1982, its first year of commercial operation. He currently signs on three or four times each day to retrieve NewsFlash hits and to conduct ad hoc searches.  He uses NewsFlash to track policy and international information on missile threat, defense and production. The ease of sifting through hits generated by NewsFlash is one of his favorite NewsNet features. "You don't have to worry about searching," he says. "NewsFlash does the work for you."<P>

When Jim does conduct searches, he generally searches wires such as Federal News Service and Kyodo News Service and daily defense services for stories of interest to ballistic missile defense. He finds the breadth of coverage and the wealth of information to be one of the most important reasons for using NewsNet. "I can retrieve large amounts of information from various services and bring them together to produce a nice presentation that is very effective for our needs."<P>
