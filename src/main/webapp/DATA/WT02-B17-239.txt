<P>
From the DOE perspective, industry
meetings provide the best avenue for direct input from industry
to the DOE blueprint for action--the <a href="gov_role.html">National Biomass Power Program
Five-Year Plan.</a>  The following recommendations present specific
alternative courses of action designed to capture the opportunities
discussed in the foregoing section.  Each course of action is
a distillation of the industry's comment, while specific actions
are generally representative of the many suggested approaches
to program follow-up.
<P>
<A NAME="5.1"><B>5.1 Implement an Information Dissemination
Campaign</B></A>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Key players - Regional Biomass Programs, Industry
Associations.
<P>
<LI>One page summaries on key topics disseminated
to key decision makers, industry, and other interested parties.
(What is biomass power? Environmental benefits and issues, co-firing
options.)
<P>
<LI>Biomass power report providing the latest information
on the biopower market and technology via fax.
<P>
<LI>Commercial
quality video production highlighting the operations of modern
biomass facilities and key aspects of the future role for biopower
as envisioned by the biomass program strategy.
<P>
<LI>Continue efforts
to cosponsor several national conferences and forums on biomass
power.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME="5.2"><B>5.2 Support Implementation of EPACT and other Legislative
Incentives</B></A>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Key players - DOE/HQ, industry associations,
key industries.
<P>
<LI>Provide technical input to rulemaking for
EPACT production incentives, especially definition of qualifying
facilities and feedstocks.
<P>
<LI>Channel information on status of
credits and incentives to industry through the associations.
<P>
<LI>Encourage and develop mechanism for the implementation of CO<sub>2</sub>
credit banking.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="5.3"><B>5.3 Assist Utilities and IPPs to Implement Co-firing
of Biomass and Fossil Fuels </B></A>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Key Players - Utilities,
IPPs, NREL, regional programs.
<P>
<LI>Sponsor prefeasibility studies
for cofiring retrofits.
<P>
<LI>Cosponsor test burns and cofiring
demonstrations for major classes of utility boilers.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="5.4"><B>5.4 Support
Industry Efforts to Expand the Base of Fuel Sources</B></A>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Key
Players - Industry, NREL, ORNL, regional programs.
<P>
<LI>Cosponsor
limited scope feasibility studies of new feedstock sources including
gradual introduction of energy crops.
<P>
<LI>Support limited R&D
on feedstock collection and processing methods that improve feedstock
combustion characteristics and/or lower costs.
<P>
<LI>Support R&D
for safe byproduct uses of wood ash, and wood-coal mixed ash.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="5.5"><B>5.5
 Support Industry Efforts to Demonstrate Advanced Biomass Conversion
Systems</B></A>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Key Players - Industry, NREL
<P>
<LI>Co-sponsor feasibility
studies and demonstrations of repowering existing power stations
with high efficiency biomass conversion systems.
<P>
<LI>Co-fund feasibility
studies and selected demonstrations of commercial scale power
projects that integrate sustainable, dedicated fuel supply systems
with high efficiency power generation systems.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="5.6"><B>5.6  Support
Industry Efforts to Demonstrate New Modular Generation Technology</B></A>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Key Players - Industry, NREL, USAID, Winrock.
<P>
<LI>Cosponsor
demonstrations of new U.S. modular generation systems fueled by
biomass niche domestic and international markets.
</UL>
<P>
Under the current
budget scenario for biomass power, it is unlikely that all of
these recommendations can be implemented.  As such, a continuing
dialogue between industry and DOE will be an important program
building block.  As the program moves forward, there will be room
for course corrections and review of priorities in light of changing
market and regulatory conditions.  
<P>
<sup>1</sup>Biomass yields can be up to 5 tons per acre.
