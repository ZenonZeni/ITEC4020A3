<p>Slidell, La.-- A former teacher of the year in St. Tammany
Parish and her husband were arrested Thursday after deputies
found 10 marijuana plants growing in their home. Laurie Wilder
Maschek, 32, a fifth-grade teacher at Abney Elementary School,
and James Maschek, 34, face charges of marijuana cultivation and
possession with intent to distribute. Deputies said that the
plants, which were about 7-8 feet tall, were growing in specially
treated soil in individual plastic containers inside a room with
