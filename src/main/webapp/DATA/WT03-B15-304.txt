<H1>EUROPEAN REGIONAL SERVICE</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>Economic forecasting service for business and government in the Single
European Market</H2></CENTER>
<CENTER>
<H2>Includes the international annual reports
<I>Europe in 2001</I> and <I>European Regional Prospects</I></H2></CENTER>
<P>Cambridge Econometrics' European Regional Service draws on the pooled
expertise of the ERECO network of forecasting institutes in Germany, France,
Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and the United Kingdom. The service provides
analysis and forecasts by sector in <I>Europe in 2001</I> and by region and
city in <I>European Regional Prospects</I>.</P>
<P><I>Europe in 2001</I> is the latest in an annual series of ERECO reports
providing medium-term forecasts and analysis for five years ahead by <B>sector</B>
for the major European economies and the European Union as a whole.  The series
has been published since 1989 and provides an authoritative reference for the
prospects for key sectors.  Its pan-European coverage and authorship ensure a
truly international analysis, appropriate to an increasingly integrated European
market.</P>
<P>CE complements this sectoral analysis with forecasts of European <B>urban</B>
and <B>regional</B> change, again using a medium-term forecast horizon.  The
results are published in the annual ERECO series <I>European Regional Prospects</I>,
which is also produced in association with our European partners.  The series
provides economic forecasts for the regions of the existing European Union of 15
and also those of Norway.  Special attention is paid to the processes of change
in the most important European city regions. The report uses a consistent
database and a comprehensive modelling approach, with the views and analysis of
experts from all over Europe embodied as part of the process of forecasting
economic change in the major urban and regional economies.</P>
<P>These major ERECO reports may be purchased individually, or as part of
Cambridge Econometrics' European Regional Service.  Subscribers to the service
receive other important benefits, such as access on diskettes to the sectoral
and regional data and forecasts, a meeting at the subscriber's office to present
and discuss the forecasts, and telephone support.</P>

follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><I>The European Commission is very much concerned with the issue of social
and economic cohesion between the regions of the EU.  Is a significant reduction
of regional disparities in standards of living an attainable goal in the medium
term?  By providing answers to questions like this, the European Regional
Service should make an important and indeed unique contribution to the analysis
of growth and change in the regions of Europe.</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
