DELEGATION ACCOMPANIES SALVADORAN BISHOP HOME
90-1-1-FI

     CHICAGO (ELCA) - The Rev. Medardo Gomez, bishop of the
Lutheran Church of El Salvador, plans to return to El Salvador
from exile in Guatemala to celebrate the Feast of Epiphany, Jan.
6-8.  An ecumenical delegation, including the vice president and
three bishops of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, is
accompanying Gomez in El Salvador to ensure his safety.
     Gomez intends to enter San Salvador Jan. 6 to hold an
Epiphany service at Resurrection Lutheran Church, where he is the
pastor.  He will also participate in worship at the Roman
Catholic Cathedral with Archbishop Rivera y Damas and in an
ecumenical service at the Oscar Romero chapel at the Central
American University.
     ELCA Vice President Christine Grumm of San Francisco, Bishop
David C. Wold of the  Southwestern Washington Synod, Bishop Peter
Rogness of the Greater Milwaukee Synod and Bishop Wayne E.
Weissenbuehler of the Rocky Mountain Synod are included in the
delegation escorting Gomez in his homeland.
     The ELCA selected several delegation members, said the Rev.
James E. Henneberger, area secretary for Latin America in the
ELCA Division for Global Mission.  "Some had been there before.
They are people we feel are astute enough to be objective but
also to be sensitive to the subtleties of what they see and
hear."
     Gomez had asked the ELCA and the Salvadoran Humanitarian
Aid, Research and Education Foundation of Washington, D. C., to
organize the ecumenical delegation.  SHARE is a non-profit
organization founded in 1981 to provide aid to refugees and
displaced people in El Salvador.
     Henneberger expressed plans for the ELCA, through his
office, to organize ecumenical delegations on a regular basis to
visit El Salvador.
     Death threats against Gomez and accusations that he
participated in "subversive military activities" prompted him to
leave El Salvador Nov. 25.  He set up offices in Guatemala City,
Guatemala, and indicated his intention to return to his country
as soon as possible.
     Gomez has accused "the armed forces of El Salvador" of
several acts of oppression against the Lutheran, Roman Catholic,
Episcopal, Baptist and Mennonite churches, as well as the
Ecumenical Coordination of Churches there.  Lutheran church
workers have been arrested, searched, threatened and deported.
     Other members of the delegation are Episcopal Bishop Roger
White of Milwaukee; Eileen Purcell, executive director of SHARE;
the Rev. Gustav Schultz, of Berkeley, Calif., an ELCA pastor and
president of the SHARE Foundation; the Rev. Arthur F. McGovern, a
Jesuit priest and professor of philosophy at the University of
Detroit; the Rev. Robert McAfee Brown, a Presbyterian theologian
from the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, Calif.; the Rev.
Miguel Palacios of the Episcopal Diocese of Guatemala City; Eric
Popkin, Wisconsin Council of Churches; and Mary Beth Murphy, a
reporter for the Milwaukee Sentinel.

STUDENTS DISCUSS FAITH AND SCIENCE
90-1-2-DM

     ST. LOUIS (ELCA) -- Nearly 300 Lutheran college students
welcomed in the last decade of a century that has been marked by
a revolution in high technology with a conference on issues of
faith and science.
     The students came here from about 80 different universities
for a conference held Dec. 28-Jan. 1.  The conference "Stewards
of Technology Responding to God's Call,"  was sponsored by the
Lutheran Student Movement-USA.
     "The most important thing we can do is bring the Christian
value of cooperation into our communities...that will do more for
technology than all the high technology we can use," said keynote
speaker Dr. Rustum Roy, a leading U.S. materials scientist
involved in the first Vatican and National Council of Churches
discussions of science and religion.
     "Don't attack anybody, just go ask everybody a lot of
questions in a Woody Allen fashion," he said.  Roy is professor
of the solid state and professor of geochemistry at Pennsylvania
State University, University Park, PA.  He also serves as
director of the university's Science, Technology and Society
Program.
     "Newness is the principal character of godliness and chance
is its principal agent on earth," said Roy in calling students to
"prayerful, thoughtful, careful experimenting with life."
     "Rippling through the whole scheme is a magnificent,
glorious, unifying and loving experience that we in the West have
called God," said a second keynote speaker, Dr. George K.
Schweitzer, alumni distinguished professor of chemistry at the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
     "I do not know how love expresses him or herself out there
in the universe," he said.  "I do know God is and has been
communicating everywhere."
     In plenary action, students passed resolutions in favor of
conserving water, being accepting of non-Christians and combating
racism.  They narrowly defeated a resolution supporting the
humane use of animals in biomedical research and testing.
     Students attended workshops and worship services which
centered on faith and science issues.  They also visited the zoo
and botanical gardens in St. Louis.
     "We are the future leaders of our churches, and by exposing
us now to the problems of tomorrow it starts our minds turning,"
said Bill Neumyer of Palmyra, Pa., who was elected LSM president
for 1990.  Newmyer is beginning graduate work in nuclear
engineering at the University of Tennessee.  He is a recent
graduate from Penn State.
     The Lutheran Student Movement-USA is a pan-Lutheran student
group with members from several U.S. Lutheran denominations.  Its
annual conference is provided with major financial and staff
support from the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.

LIRS RECEIVES CONGRESSIONAL TRIBUTE
90-1-3-BB

     WASHINGTON -- Ten members of the U.S. Congress paid tribute
to Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service in remarks made in
the Senate and House at the start of LIRS's yearlong 50th
anniversary observance.
     Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who chairs the subcommittee
on immigration and refugee affairs in the Senate, said LIRS was a
"phenomenal humanitarian agency.
     "LIRS has made the difference between lives of oppression
and deprivation and lives of hope and freedom for over 150,000
refugees from throughout the world," he said.
     Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., who chairs the House
subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international law,
commended LIRS for "its efforts in organizing assistance for
children who are being kept in detention centers because of their
lack of legal status in this country."
     "While the LIRS does not seek recognition for its
humanitarian efforts, I rise today to commend them," said Sen.
Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore.  "With the world's refugee population
estimated at 14 million, the work of organizations such as the
LIRS assumes an ever-increasing significance."
     Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., called LIRS "a vibrant organization
for 50 years."
     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said the more than 6,000
congregational sponsors that have joined LIRS in the resettlement
process, "also deserve praise for their untiring work in
accepting newcomers.  As the only refugee serving in the U.S.
Senate, I have a deep concern for the plight of refugees and
immigrants.  I have worked closely with LIRS in the past and look
forward to a continued close working relationship."  Boschwitz is
a member of LIRS's honorary 50th anniversary committee.
     Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said "It is the private
voluntary organizations like LIRS which are truly on the front
lines of refugee policy.  On both the local and international
level, private voluntary organizations help governments grapple
with the growing refugee problem."
     Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, D-N.Y., noted the involvement of
LIRS "in efforts to chart a more humane immigration and refugee
policy within the United States and among the nations of the
world."
     Rep. Thomas E. Petri, R-Wis., pointed out that LIRS is "one
of just two voluntary agencies that resettles unaccompanied
minors."  LIRS has placed more than 3,000 unaccompanied refugee
children in foster care since 1978.
     Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass., said that in Massachusetts
"the work of LIRS is well known and has added to the very fabric
of our life as a commonwealth."
     "The work of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service makes
Christ's words manifest and is a shining beacon of hope in a
world in which the lack of human compassion sometimes seems
overwhelming," Christ said that as you have done to the least of
these you have also done it unto me, said Rep. Timothy P.
Johnson, D-S.D.
     LIRS serves on behalf of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in
America, Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and Latvian Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America.  "Opening Doors" is the theme of its
anniversary observance which will continue until next fall.
