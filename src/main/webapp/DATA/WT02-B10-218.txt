The Department of Comparative Medical Science remains fully accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. This animal care facility serves scientists at Psychiatric Institute, the Center for Neurobiology and Behavior, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and provides the best possible care for all animals. During the past year, we have made several advances in both the physical aspects of the facility and in the efficiency of its operations. Renovation of the steam exhaust system was completed, markedly improving the work environment for our staff. In addition, an automatic system for providing water to animals was installed. This system is labor saving, economical, and easier to sanitize than our previous water system. In response to the increasing care of transgenic mice, we have also revised our procedures to include autoclaving their cages to ensure the elimination of potentially harmful microorganisms.

Our continuing education program has been highly effective. All personnel involved in animal research have now attended at least one seminar covering the rules and regulations that govern laboratory animal care, as well as animal procedures, and animal care preventive medicine. Dr. Marshall Primack continues to manage our Occupational Health Program. Our animal health monitoring system demonstrates that all the animals housed in PI are healthy.
