<h1>Lifestyle</h1>
<p>
Victoria's natural attractions and temperate climate, together with 
its cultural heritage and the quality of lifestyle, are important 
contributors 
to Victoria's positive business environment.

<p>
Melbourne, Victoria's capital city, is one of the world's most liveable 
cities and one of its most beautiful. With its twin advantages of 
seaside and riverside locations, Melbourne offers a superb living 
and working environment for residents and visitors alike.

<p><hr>
<h1>Leisure</h1>
<p>
There are few other places where people have access to so many 
leisure activities. The temperate climate allows participation in 
many sports, including yachting, swimming, cricket, several kinds of 
football, snow skiing, bushwalking, tennis and golf.

<p>
Melbourne is home to the Australian Tennis Open and the Grand 
Prix. Twenty-five public and 50 private courses are available to 
golfing enthusiasts in Melbourne alone, many of them of world 
standard.

<p>
Melbourne's mix of cultures makes it one of world's great dining-
out 
cities. Victoria's vineyards produce a wide range of outstanding 
wines, enthusiastically sought by connoisseurs at home and abroad.
