         <BLOCKQUOTE><P><FONT SIZE=4>EMERYVILLE, CA (April 16, 1996)
         -- SuperGen, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUPG), a development stage
         pharmaceutical company, announced today that its
         Investigational New Drug (IND) application with the U.S.
         Food and Drug Administration for a new Phase II human
         clinical study of its proprietary antiobesity drug has been
         cleared. The drug, "RF 1051", is administered in pill form.
         RF 1051 currently is in ongoing Phase I/II human clinical
         studies, under a separate IND, based on a daily dosage
         schedule. The new IND was filed for concurrent trials with
         an intermittent schedule of dosing every two days.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>The new study will involve approximately 80
         patients at two sites, Evanston Hospital in Illinois and the
         Orlando Clinical Center in Florida.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>RF 1051 is an orally administered
         formulation of a human steroidal hormone which also has been
         successfully tested in the ob/ob (obese) mouse and the db/db
         (diabetic) mouse models. SuperGen believes that RF 1051
         plays a role in the intake and output of energy, rather than
         relying on appetite suppression or the stimulation of
         increased metabolic activity.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Under a Physician's IND, in a randomized,
         double-blind crossover study with 17 obese human subjects
         over a 20-week period, patients lost significantly more
         weight during RF 1051 administration than during placebo
         administration. Their weight loss was maintained for an
         additional 10-week follow-up period.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>"While we believe an oral rather than
         injectable drug will be critical to the success of long-term
         antiobesity treatment, we also believe the least stringent
         dosing schedule will have the most advantage," said Joseph
         Rubinfeld, Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Scientific Officer of
         SuperGen.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>"Results from previous human studies suggest
         that RF 1051 has a serum half-life that may support
         administration on less than a daily basis, and our ultimate
         goal is a twice-weekly dosage regimen," Dr. Rubinfeld
         continued. "No clinical side effects from RF 1051 have yet
         been observed. This trial was designed to obtain preliminary
         efficacy results from intermittent dosage, concurrent with
         ongoing daily dosage trials, and to help us plan later-stage
         clinical trials with the optimal dosing schedule."</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Dr. Rubinfeld cautioned that, while recently
         lauded injectable approaches to obesity have garnered
         enormous public attention even prior to any human data,
         SuperGen's obesity pill still is in early human studies. He
         said that results to date are scientifically and clinically
         encouraging to the company, but that long-term patient
         benefit cannot be established without further trials. He
         added that initial results in humans, ob/ob mice and db/db
         mice have established RF 1051 as a top priority for
         SuperGen.</FONT>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE=4>Based in Emeryville, CA, SuperGen is a
         development stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the
