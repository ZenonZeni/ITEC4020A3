As you know, Kemper Funds believes that working with a financial representative is the best way to evaluate todayís investment alternatives.

<BR><BR>

"Financial representative" is a catch-all term for the licensed professionals who represent others' financial interests. Investors today have their choice of where they meet their representative (at a brokerage office, at a financial institution or in their home, for example), the level of service (from full to limited) they want to receive, and how services will be compensated for. And, as markets become increasingly complex and global, an increasing number of financial representatives have continued with their education. 

<BR><BR>

Do you need help in deciphering your financial representative's business card? Despite the many possible affiliations and designations, almost every financial representative comes from one of four basic disciplines. Here's a quick portrait of each "type."

<BR><BR>

<B>The accountant</B><BR>
You expect a certified public accountant (CPA) to be able to advise you on audit, accounting and tax issues. To offer more encompassing help, including personal income tax planning, investment planning and estate planning, many CPAs also have sought accreditation from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, as a Personal Financial Specialist (PFS). A PFS must have several hours of planning experience over a three-year period, pass a comprehensive exam and submit references. Reaccreditation is required every three years.

<BR><BR>

<B>The insurance agent</B><BR>
To be serving as a financial representative, an insurance agent can be expected to have a license to sell securities as well as insurance. Insurance agents' interest in the spectrum of personal financial management has led to the creation of a Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC) designation. Accreditation requires coursework (in investments, income taxation and estate and financial planning), a minimum of three years of experience and adherence to a code of ethics. Chartered life underwriters (CLUs) qualify for a fast track to the ChFC, but the designation is not 
exclusive to the insurance industry. The American College, Bryn Mawr, Pa., awards the ChFC.  

<BR><BR>

<B>The financial planner</B><BR>
Financial planners represent a broad view, offering advice in investment planning (including mutual funds and individual securities), insurance, taxes, retirement, estate and investment planning. A certified financial planner (CFP) has completed extensive education, examination, experience and ethics requirements set by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Denver.  While almost half of all CFPs work for financial planning firms, they're also employed at securities, accounting and insurance firms and banks.

<BR><BR>

<B>The broker</B><BR>
Brokers are sales representatives who work for a brokerage firm, also known as a broker/dealer. They are registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers and have passed a qualifying examination. Because theyíre trained in securities laws, their expertise is in the selection and monitoring of stocks, bonds, mutual funds and other financial products. But while the generic "broker" gives you an idea of the representative's training, it does not satisfactorily describe the scope of his or her service. That's why many of those with a foundation in brokerage prefer 
to call themselves financial consultants or advisors. Many brokers also have 
additional designations, such as the CFP.
