<h2>About Band Gaps</h2>

<p><font size=+2>W</font>hen photons of <a href="lightsun.html">sunlight</a> strike a PV cell, only the photons with a certain level of energy are
able to <a href="howworks.html">free electrons</a> from their atomic bonds to produce an electric current. This level of
energy, known as the band-gap energy, is defined as the amount of energy required to dislodge an
electron from its convalent bond and allow it to become part of an electrical circuit.  The
energy that photons possess is called the "photon energy."  This energy must be at least as high
as the band-gap energy for a photon to free an electron.  However, photons with energy higher
than the band-gap energy will expend the extra energy as heat when freeing the electrons.  So,
it's important for a PV cell to be "tuned" (through slight modifications to the semiconductor's
molecular structure) to maximize the photon energy.  After all, one key to obtaining an 
<a href="conveff.html">efficient PV cell</a> is to convert as much sunlight into electricity as possible.  

<p>Effective PV semiconductors have band-gap energies ranging from 1.0 to 1.6 electron-volts
(eV).  (An electron-volt is equal to the energy an electron acquires when it passes through a
potential of 1 volt in a vacuum.)   That's because this level of energy is good for freeing
electrons without causing extra heat.  For example, crystalline silicon's band-gap energy is 1.1
eV.

<p>The photon energy of light, also measured in eV, varies according to the different wavelengths
of light. The entire spectrum of sunlight, from infrared to ultraviolet, covers a range of about 0.5
eV to about 2.9 eV. For example, red light has an energy of about 1.7 eV, and blue light has an
energy of about 2.7 eV.  About
55% of the energy of sunlight cannot be used by most PV cells because this energy is either
below the band gap or carries excess energy.

<p><font color="#F79D00">Different PV materials have different characteristic energy band
gaps.  Photons with energy greater than the band gap may be absorbed to create free electrons. 
Photons with energy less than the band gap pass through the material or create heat.</font>
