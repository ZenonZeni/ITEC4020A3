Science at SEA is an educational seminar for high school students
aged 15 to 18 who have completed two high school science and/or
math courses. Coursework focuses on the coastal and offshore marine
environment around Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
<P>
Study takes place on shore at <A href="madden.htm">SEA's campus in Woods Hole</A>
and at sea on board one of SEA's sailing research vessels. Science
at SEA students explore the marine environment from several perspectives--scientific,
historical, literary -- and learn the theories of sailing and navigation.
Learning and developing skills in traditional ways, students are
called upon to put them into practice when they board the ship
to live, work at study at sea.<BR>

<H3>Phase I: On Shore at SEA's Woods Hole Campus<BR>
</H3>

<P>
During the Shore Component, students participate in two courses:
<STRONG>Introduction to Oceanography</STRONG> and <STRONG>Introduction
to Nautical Science</STRONG>. In addition, seminars are held on
maritime history and literature of the sea. Classes are held Monday
through Friday. Through lectures, seminars, laboratory activities
and field trips, students are introduced to the study of marine
science and navigation in an historic and modern context. In small
groups, students and instructors work closely to integrate these
topics and prepare them for the responsibilities they will take
on when they go to sea on board the vessel. Students are expected
to complete homework assignments and take two tests. Grades and
evaluations are given.<BR>
Topics covered on shore:<BR>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Introduction to Oceanography</STRONG>: Structure of
the Earth; Marine Geology and Sediments; Wind-Driven Circulation;
Thermohaline Circulation; Seawater Chemistry; Biology of Marine
Organisms; Marine Mammals.
<LI><STRONG>Introduction to Nautical Science</STRONG>: Piloting
and Chartwork; Charts and the Compass; Ship Handling Under Sail;
Life at Sea; Safety and Seamanship; Ship Stability; Aerodyamics
and Hydrodynamics; Radar Plotting.<BR>

</UL>

<H4>Campus Life:<BR>
</H4>

<P>
Students live on campus in one of five residential cottages with
up to seven other students and closely supervised by an adult
resident House Leader. House Leaders also serve as Teaching Assistants
on shore and go to sea with the students as instructors during
the Sea Component. Life in each cottage revolves around its communal
kitchen and dining area where students help plan and prepare meals,
and share ideas, frustrations and excitement with one another.
Every evening, quiet time is reserved for study, using SEA's library,
student lounge, computer lab and cottages.
<P>
Evening and weekend extracurricular activities are led by House
Leaders, with input from the students. These optional activities
many include visits to the Cape Cod National Seashore, day trips
to Martha's Vineyard, musical entertainment, and &quot;movie and
popcorn&quot; nights. Students share outdoor activities such as
playing volleyball, soccer and frisbee and exploring the local
bike path and beaches.<BR>

<H3>Phase II: At Sea on the Waters Around Cape Cod</H3>

<P>
Upon successful completion of the shore component, students join
either the SSV <I>Westward</I> (125-foot staysail
schooner) or the SSV <I>Corwith Cramer</I>
(134-foot brigantine) for the ten-day sea component. Each of 
<A HREF="../shipinfo/shiptop.htm" TARGET="_top">SEA's ships</A>
holds 21 students and 14 professional crew and faculty. Daily
activities aboard the vessel immerse students in all operations
of a modern sailing research vessel -- collecting scientific data,
operating the vessel's diesel engine, setting and striking the
sails, helping in the ship's galley, and much more. Each afternoon,
students participate in lectures and directed activities in both
Oceanography and Nautical Science.<BR>

<H4>Watch Activities</H4>

<P>
Each student is assigned to a watch group of eight people with
whom he/she rotates through the 24-hour watch schedule. While
a student watch group is on duty, each person is assigned to a
particular area of the vessel for the duration of the watch period:
in the lab, on deck, in the galley, or in the engine room.
<P>
During the deck portion of the watch, students participate in
navigational exercises led by the mate on duty. These exercises
include opportunities to maneuver the vessel, radar plotting,
and near-shore piloting with charts and compass.
<P>
During the lab watch, students participate in special oceanographic
activities led by the scientist on duty. These include deploying
oceanographic instruments to determine characteristics of the
water column, the sea floor, and the biological organisms of the
area, and analyzing the data already collected during the cruise.
<BR>

<H4>Scientific Data Collection<BR>
</H4>

<P>
Oceanographic data are collected by students on a regular basis
throughout the 24-hour daily operation of the vessel. These data
include sea surface temperature, surface salinity, barometric
pressure, water depth and weather observations.
<P>
Scientific stations are conducted each day. A station occurs any
time the vessel is maneuvered to allow oceanographic equipment
to be deployed and recovered. Each watch has the opportunity to
handle the equipment and assist in collecting and analyzing the
cruise data.
<P>
There is a hands-on, practical test at sea as well as group presentations.
Each watch group is assigned the task of collecting data at one
major station. With the help of the scientists, the students analyze
and interpret that information. Then each watch group compiles
their data and creates scientific tables and figures to illustrate
their results. The cruise culminates with a series of oral presentations
from each watch/study group given to the ship's complement outlining
their findings and conclusions.<BR>
