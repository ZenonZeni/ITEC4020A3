<P>



<A NAME = "namis"><H2>NAMI'S MISSION AND GOALS</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A>

<P>

As stated in our bylaws the mission of the National Alliance for

the Mentally Ill is "to eradicate mental illness and improve the

quality of life of those affected by these diseases."

<P>

In the NAMI Long Range Plan, adopted by the Board of Directors in

1988, the mission was further developed as specific goals and

objectives for the organization were defined.

<P>

GOAL:  NAMI will be recognized as the primary source for

information and helpful referral on all aspects of mental

illness.

<P>

GOAL:  The general public will understand that mental illnesses

are no-fault, biologically based, treatable, and may eventually

be curable. The general public will be exposed to and understand

possible solutions and alternative approaches to

services/treatment for mentally ill people.

<P>

GOAL:  Educators and care-givers will incorporate current

research into mental illness practice.

<P>

GOAL:  Mental illness will receive its fair share of government

resources and entitlement based on its incidence and effect on

society.

<P>

In 1990 the Board adopted 7 key priorities to guide our program

planning.  Below is the current list of priorities:

<P>

<OL>

<LI>We place continued emphasis on scientific research so that we

learn causes and develop cures as soon as possible.



<LI>We work to accomplish a major turnaround in the quality,

quantity and accessibility of services to people with mental

illness.



<LI>We work to exercise a profound influence on the development

and implementation of professional/provider education.



<LI>We increase our outreach to men and underserved populations

such as young families with children under 18, minorities and

high and low income families.



<LI>We increase our membership to at least one million families by

the year 2000.



<LI>We work to greatly improve our responsiveness to needs and our

ability to communicate with one another.



<LI>We do more to directly empower ourselves, with particular

emphasis on developing leadership and management skills.

</OL>

<A NAME = "histo"><H2>HISTORY OF NAMI</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A>

<P>



NAMI is a unique organization.  It began when 254 persons met in

Madison, Wisconsin in September, 1979 to consider how to help

themselves and their mentally ill relatives.

<P>

In one emotional and unforgettable weekend, these pioneers formed

a true grass roots family movement. Although there were a number

of concerned and caring professionals and providers in

attendance, the founders were determined to make NAMI an

organization governed for and by families and consumers.

<P>

(The term 'consumer' is used to describe those who suffer from

mental illness; it is used because, as 'consumers' of various

health and support services, they must be involved in the

development and management of those services, as well as the

underlying research).

<P>

By 1980 NAMI had achieved incorporation, received non-profit tax-

exempt status, and elected an initial Board of Directors.   Early

efforts centered on making connections with small family support

groups across the nation.  An annual conference was planned and a

newsletter was published. We were really on our way!

<P>

From the beginning, NAMI was focused on the unmet needs of people

suffering from the most severe and disabling forms of mental

illness -- schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness and severe

depression.

<P>

These are the persons most in need of long term help and support.

<P>

Severe mental illnesses are very stigmatized in American society;

for decades parents were blamed as the cause of their relatives'

mental disorder.

<P>

NAMI families found courage and hope in joining together to

advocate for needed changes in public policy and attitudes.

<P>

NAMI is persuaded by current research that major mental illnesses

are biochemical brain diseases which can affect anyone, and which

are without known prevention or cure.

<P>

These are not rare disorders; NIMH research has shown that as

many as 8 to 10 percent of all Americans suffer from severe

mental illness, and as many as 1 in 5 families are affected.

<P>

NAMI opened  its first office in Washington DC in 1982 and began

the work of influencing Congress, the Administration and key

decision-makers.  We filled an important gap.

<P>

In a "mental health" community NAMI was exclusively concerned

about mental illness.  In a field long dominated by physicians

and other professionals and service providers, NAMI brought the

long silent voice of caring families and consumers.

<P>

Early leaders spoke out boldly for greater attention to those

afflicted with schizophrenia and affective disorders.  And we

began to ask for accountability from a government that was not

making a significant investment in either research or services

focused on mental illnesses.

<P>

Thousands of families have come "out of the closet" to join NAMI

and embrace our mental illness agenda. Today we number over

140,000 members and approximately 1000 affiliates in all 50

states! 

<P>

Growth brought diversity to the NAMI membership.  In 1985 we

formed a Consumer Council to ensure stronger representation of

those who have suffered with psychiatric illnesses.

<P>

Networks have also been created as a way for members who share a

special identity or focus to meet and work together. By the end

of the 1980's state Alliances had been formed in 46 states.

<P>

As the NAMI membership has grown, so too has the size of

the staff that serves them.  In 1985 we moved our offices to

Rosslyn and in 1988 we moved again to our present location at

Court House.  

<P>

As we continue to expand our organizations size and services, we

see the wisdom of the founding members.  NAMI is truly a family,

united in the belief that by working together we can make a

difference in the lives of our loved ones.

<P>

To that end we have built the organization on four cornerstones: 

SUPPORT, EDUCATION, ADVOCACY and RESEARCH. All across the

country, the family movement is working to bring hope and

progress to thousands of people with severe mental illnesses.
