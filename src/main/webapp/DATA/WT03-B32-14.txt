PLAN NOW FOR '96


INTRO

Which baseball player once said, "It's tough to
make predictions-especially about the
future"? It's not tough in the technology industry
so long as you relegate its dazzle to
third place. First and second: the capitalization
of the technology's packagers and their
marketing (not just advertising) smarts.

Don't rush into buying laptops

Intel is pulling the rug out from under the laptop
makers' monopoly on motherboards. It
plans to package cheap generic Pentium
motherboards that any vendor can mold into its
laptops. So watch for laptop prices to drop
several hundred dollars by year's end-and try
not to buy until they do.

You'll see IBM suffer again in '96 for their lack
of mass-marketing savvy as they keep
trying to sell Aptivas and OS/2 to the home market
instead of businesses. Apple, too,
will keep ignoring markets that love them
(engineers, designers and publishers). While
they woo generic users in business, homes and
schools, software vendors will scale back
Mac support.

Microsoft has an evangelist to the accounting
profession and just struck a deal to bundle
Big Bill's software with Compaqs. So we'll see
more ads (and editorial praise) for
Compaq in other accounting publications in '96.
But Compaq won't win back all those
CPA firms that powered its early success until it
stops hugging the high end of the price
scale.

Buzzwords to learn and use

For three years, the AICPA's Information
Technology section has ranked EDI first in
important technologies for CPAs to understand. '96
could be the year your clients
pressure you to add it to their accounting
packages. Luckily, smart accounting software
makers will supply the link this year. We'll help
you with EDI how-tos-and alert you to
good EDI seminars.

This is the year that mainstream CPA firms will-
for the first time-give serious thought
to encouraging members to telecommute. Reasons: It
can cut real estate and furnishing
costs, travel budgets and absenteeism. And managed
right, it will increase productivity.
If your firm wants to stay competitive, you'll
start using groupware this year: a program
like Lotus Notes or Collabra Share if you occupy
several offices, one like Word if your
groups are simple. Biggest benefit: multiuser
simultaneous document revision with all
changes and remarks stamped with date, time and
reviser's initials. One or all can then
review all changes and accept them fast in whole
or part.

This year, you'll be able to set clients up with
publication warehousing (also called
publishing on demand). They'll then store
catalogs, manuals, policy handbooks and
similar publications on disk and desktop-publish
up-to-date copies as needed. Your firm,
too, will try harder this year to run a paperless
office. Biggest winners: our forests and
everyone's paper budgets.

In '96, says editor-at-large Rick Richardson,
you'll pare overtime and temp wages if you
use agents-1996's stunning successor to your old
DOS batch files. Why? Every night at
11 pm, an agent in our backup software backs up
all our files without a human
command. Every time a new subscriber joins our
ranks, an agent in Commence (see
CPACR 1/95, p. 2) starts Word, opens the right
file, inserts the subscriber's name and
prints a binder cover page-all on its own.

Windows 95 has only limited agentry powers. Free
first aid: Richardson's list of vendors
who sell add-on or stand-alone agents is yours
free from us for a phone call, a fax, an E-
mail note-or pick it up at our Web site.

This year, if your firm's growing, you'll want to
switch to US Robotics, Motorola or
another vendor's ISDN-ready modems. They plug into
ISDN lines or regular phone
lines. In cities with reasonable Baby Bells, ISDN
will gain you a lot of bandwidth for
configuring as phone lines, web connections, video
lines and more (see this issue's
Bookshelf item, p. 8).

If your firm's small, you'll discover the joys of
non-ISDN modems that can pass along
caller ID data. We tied Motorola's new Power
Series 28.8 Data/Fax Modem into the
subscriber database kept by Commence. It pulls a
subscriber's record onscreen as we
pick up the phone!

Buzzwords to ignore in '96

P6 PCs? No way! Even the most eager vendors can't
yet buy a model that works. Your
P5 (Pentium) PCs won't become obsolete in '96.
Another sure thing: When the next
chip's advertised, mark my word: it won't be
called a Sexium.

Data warehousing? CPAs aren't the only ones
dreaming of being able to list all the
scattered company data in one virtual warehouse
that lets any user access it on
command. There's been progress-but don't expect a
standard technology to be ready in
'96.

Internet commerce? Watch it stall in '96 as buyers
get bored surfing the rubbish that'll
glut the ether. (Example: one university's selling
ads aimed at accountants surfing their
accounting department's site.) Who'll make money
on the Net?

Computer hardware and software vendors, who'll cut
real-time tech support costs by
side-tracking users to online support stations;

vendors of products with nerd appeal, such as net-
linked multiplayer games;

overseas vendors of products that people can't (or
won't) buy face-to-face-so long as
they're delivered in plain wrappers. Congress will
learn that they can't pass laws
banning international Internet commerce.

Information extractors? Don't fall for this year's
replacement for last decade's promise of
expert systems. As your firm's shower of online
download turns into a deluge, lots of
new products will claim, in ads, to perform fast,
intelligent information extraction.
Prediction: Your brain won't always be faster, but
it's far less likely to throw out the
wheat with the chaff.

Call for input: If your firm uses groupware or
telecommutes, please phone or fax your
comments to 800-260-1120 for an upcoming report.

THE QUEST FOR A PROFITABLE CLIENT WRITE-UP


INTRO

Ever since CPAs started losing write-up business
to clients who think they can be their
own accountants using programs like One-Write Plus
and Quicken, we've been
encouraging write-up software vendors to give us
ammunition to fight back. When I met
with a number of them in 1994, they agreed that
heftier write-up software could help
CPAs give clients management information they
can't get from low-end accounting
software.

We're still waiting. All that's happened is that
one vendor I met with-Peachtree-dumped
its write-up program.

The biggest hope for write-up's future is Windows,
which can provide easy, effortless
data swapping between compliant programs. Knowing
that, subscribers have been
phoning to ask about the Windows write-ups. Our
verdict: Sorry. First-generation
Windows write-ups show promise, nothing more.

So Rigotti & Assoc. of Taylor, MI, sticks with
BusinessWorks (see review on p. 9). CPA
Mark Rigotti explains,  "It's medium-end, so once
you get to know it well and become a
qualified installer, you've opened up a practice
in consulting."

And some CPAs are moving back to write-up
programs. Reasons: For simple repetitive
data entry and reporting, they're faster. And
three of them import client-entered
bookkeeping data in a flash-if they're teamed with
the same vendor's client program.

CPAs dream of do-all write-up

McKee & Empsall of Malone, NY, still uses Creative
Solutions' Write-Up Solution II.
CPA Bill Empsall calls it "a 1987-vintage product,
hopelessly behind the times." His
dream: "A trial balance and write-up program all
in one with workpapers, ratios,
indexing, analytical review-and a financial
statement report writer which uses drag-and-
drop to build publication-quality financial
statements."

Empsall says, "ATB for Windows, despite its
problems, comes close in concept."
Lacking: "An industry-standard database that a
report writer can access." He adds,
"Why is it necessary to have to learn two or more
programs to service one client?"

In concept, the AICPA's ATB Write-Up should be
just what the doctor ordered. Instead,
it's just ATB audit with two extras: after-the-
fact payroll processing and ability to
collect, format and print a limited range of
financial statements. Big pluses: It does
flexibly calculate company performance ratios. And
it's so similar to ATB, it's a fast
study for ATB users.

Write-ups with client editions

Three write-ups-from Cold River, Creative
Solutions and SCS/Compute-have
companion bookkeeping software that you can sell
or recommend to small clients. The
packages are set up to encourage your clients to
do just data entry and turn to you for
adjustments, monthly closings and financial
analysis.

Cold River's Veritask for Windows has almost
nothing new but its name. It's old
Accounting by Design, which Peachtree bought,
named Crystal, renamed Peachtree
Writeup for Windows-and sold. Cold River plans to
update it next year. Yet even with
no overhaul in seven years, it holds its own
against costlier competitors.

Its manual and clear screens guide you through
moving data (via Windows links and
import/export) to and from nearly all vendors' tax
and accounting programs. Warning: It
takes several hours to set up the first custom
transfer and an hour or two for each
subsequent set-up. But once set up, each to/from
template can be reused instantly.

It imports client data with nearly no set-up time
from Peachtree, Solomon III, Great
Plains (but not Dynamics) and some Computer
Associates programs.

CPA Walter F. Malcolm of Agawan, MA, describes
SCS/Compute's Datawrite client
add-on as "like QuickBooks with no GL so the
integrated AR, AP, Checkbook and
Payroll can't post." Malcolm likes it because
"with Datawrite holding the GL, there's no
muss, no fuss, no data input for the accountant."

Bridging the CPA-client gap

If smaller clients insist on using QuickBooks or
Quicken, Quick Write-Up II could be
your salvation. It imports Intuit's data into ACE,
ACCPAC Plus, ATB, DacEasy,
M*A*S 90, Veritask, Platinum, Write-Up Solution
II-or in comma-, space- or tab-
delimited ASCII for none-of-the-aboves. Tip: If
your favorite in-house client write-up is
not listed, tell vendor Don Schuster. He says
he'll try to add what you own to his export
list.

The utility is so adept, it took me a minute to
install, 20 seconds to point it to Quicken
files and tell it to move them into ATB, then 30
seconds to decide whether it should
include voided checks, omit zero'd subaccounts,
etc. In less than two minutes more, a
year of Quicken data had been exported flawlessly
to ATB.

Tax Work: From Store Front to Internet


INTRO

It had to happen: some enterprising CPAs and EAs
are already selling tax preparation
services on proprietary Web sites. Here's where
you can see them at work.

http://www.traveller.com/%7Esaltek/

 is where E. Saltek does on-line income tax
preparation using a Netscape server. To
keep data (hopefully) confidential, he advises
clients to use Netscape's matching
browser. To read Saltek's theories on encryption,
point your browser to .
http://www.rsa.com/netsite/PK-Intro.html

http://www.taxwizard.com

is home for Tax Wizard, an "interactive tax
organizer" set up by Los Angeles
CPAs Hargrave and Hargrave to download tax data
from Web-happy tax clients.

http://www.5010geary.com/

is run by 1-800-TAX-LAWS, a nationwide
network of CPAs, EAs, LPAs and
attorneys loosely tied by an 800-number referral
service. The site provides on-line tax
preparation plus tax, estate, investment and
retirement planning.

RIA buys SCS/Compute

12/24/95: RIA just offered to buy SCS/Compute,
which renewed product development a
few years ago after a long sleep. We expect a
deal.

Acquisitive parent Thompson Publishing keeps hands
off subsidiaries as long as they
make money. So, with SCS/Compute's programs backed
by RIA's capital and sound
management, CPA firms can only come out ahead.

Also this month, RIA licensed Intuit to sell RIA's
Research Companion to TurboTax
ProSeries buyers. It contains 1,500 easily
searched paragraphs on individual and
corporate tax, pension plans, employee benefits,
and estate and gift taxes. There are also
IRS addresses, tax calendars and 40+ pages of
depreciation and inclusion amount tables.

Free seminar tackles 2000 woes

1/23/96, 1 pm EST: Great Plains' next national 50-
minute teleconference for
accountants helps you solve the computer problems
that'll result from changing system
dates to the year 2000 (see CPACR 9/95 p. 89).
Great Plains CPA Wayne Harding
points out that CPA/consultants need to know now
what to expect. Reason: Software
that calculates future events will hit the
millennium before 2000 and clients may hold
you accountable for expensive errors.

You can listen to Toronto information systems
consultant Peter de Jager and other
experts and ask questions via an MCI conferencing
line. To "attend:" You must
preregister but there's no fee or phone charge.

4/30/96: The next teleconference in the series, on
how accountants can use the Internet.

Accounting software updates

Version 3.5 of Peachtree Accounting for Windows
(see 9/95 CPACR review, p. 87) is
nearly free of the bugs that frustrated pioneer
users. It comes with 75 sample business
templates and a Q&A format for fast set-up. Its
box holds a CD-ROM and disks-take
your pick. The Mylar includes SharkWare (a so-so
PIM) and Timeslips Accounting Link
(TAL) to import t&b data from Timeslips.

Note to CPAs: This small-business program bears no
resemblance to bulky old Peachtree
Accounting for DOS. Warning: Its ability to change
and erase old transactions destroys
audit trailing.

MYOB's Version 6 (see review,  CPACR 5/95 p. 41)
adds a report customizer with 100
tailorable templates. Its help is improved and,
like Peachtree, it bundles TAL. It now
matches Peachtree in import/export ease and
ability to manage jobs and projects. Its
inventory still beats Peachtree, and it can also
accrue vacation and sick pay balances.
Still unchanged: its danger-laden turn-on/turn-off
audit trail button. Note: It's not
multiuser.

New Fax Master lets M*A*S 90 users fax invoices,
purchase orders, sales orders and
marketing literature without leaving the package.
It can schedule faxing for night
transmission. A built-in text editor creates cover
letters with graphic overlays of logos
and product art.

CPE tracking software

Now that we can offer 12 CPE credits/year for
reading CPACR, several subscribers are
looking for electronic CPE credit trackers.

Here are four that serve three different uses.

Linton Shafer's Continuing Education Tracking
System tracks personnel, self-schedules
in-house or sponsored courses based on staff level
and area of expertise and records
expenses and evaluations. It holds license
numbers, prepares reports for licensing
agencies and carries forward unused hours. It
exports in dBase III and bundles a
calculator, appointment calendar and notepad.
CPAs Schenck & Assoc. S.C. of Appleton, WI, wrote

Professional Education Tracking System (PET) so
that besides tracking courses and
personnel, they could cost out courses by sponsor,
instructor and location and evaluate
them for effectiveness, materials, facilities and
value.

To set up PET, you must define annual hours
needed, reporting period length and hours
and maximum allowed carry-overs. Then it makes
sure everyone meets CPE
requirements. Printouts include letters of
enrollment, yearly CPE totals and expense
reports.

Inexpensive CPELOG just tracks firm members'
credits and tells if they're meeting
license requirements. But each of its customized
name-your-state modules comes with
GAO, AICPA and NSPA requirements plus requirements
for all applicable licenses in
that state. Its reports show:

courses meeting license requirements, with needed
reporting data;

courses not qualifying for a particular license,
with reasons;

per-person per-license requirements and
deficiencies;

per-person credits earned and firm totals for a
selected license.

The program doesn't export and has no online help
but it's easy to use.

Good book/disk buys for CPAs For the bookshelf

Each of the following books is rich with
technology tips. Three include useful disks.

Conrad Carlberg's 526-page Business Analysis with
Excel helps select the best way to
crank out everything from income statements and
balance sheets to absorption and
contribution costing spreadsheets. It's also got
the shortest explanation of regression
analysis we've ever read. Use it just to look up
formulas-or copy out whole templates
from its bundled disk.

ISDN doesn't just deliver faster data than modem
calling, with faster connect and
disconnect. It provides caller ID and lets your
computer distinguish voice from data.
James Y. Bryce's 524-page Using ISDN shows how to
buy and hook onto ISDN services
for everything from surfing the Internet to
interconnecting LANs. It hand-holds do-it-
yourselfers and provides tips for hiring outside
installers.

Scott Mueller's Upgrading and Repairing PCs keeps
getting better. The 5th edition's
1,394-pages will help you figure out what's wrong
with a PC, whether it's worth
upgrading and what equipment's worth adding. A
long chapter on SIMMs explains the
different facets of memory so well, you'll never
be confused again. Other chapters cover
troubleshooting hard disks, sound cards and more.

A bundled CD-ROM lists vendors, tech support phone
numbers, and specs (including
factory jumper settings) for 1,400 peripheral
cards.

If you itch to make a WWW page, Andy Shafran's
Creating Your Own Netscape Web
Pages is clear, colorful, highly illustrated and
simple enough for total non-techies. Files
on the bundled disk let you explore the Web using
popular Netscape (included free) and
build Web pages. Tip: Shelve Shafran's suggestions
for adding video, audio and
animation; these memory hogs won't be standard on
the WWW for many months.

BusinessWorks

BusinessWorks works like accounting software
should

Now that the DOS and Windows versions of
BusinessWorks do virtually the same thing,
we retested these old favorites to see if they
kept up with the times.

They sure did. After Manzanita wrote Business Ties
for Prentice Hall (see review in
12/94 CPACR, p. 1)-which has been in limbo since
CLR acquired P-H-Manzanita added
all of its new goodies to their own program.
Version 10.1 for DOS and 3.95 for
Windows are now lock, stock and barrel part of the
State of the Art fold.

They're both modular, consisting of a System
Manager, GL, AP, AR, PR, Inventory, Job
Cost, Order Entry with job quoting and Crystal
Report Writer. The $95 System Manager
has a nifty any-size label maker and all modules
come network-ready for up to 48
metered users at 99 workstations. They're fast,
attractive and completely integrated.

BusinessWorks is an accrual system. It permits
$99-million account balances and uses
four digits plus two decimals for account IDs.
There's monthly closing but instant
transaction posting to the GL and easy fast look-
up everywhere. It keeps 99 companies,
does consolidation and passwords by company,
module and task. It prepares product or
service invoices. Payments can be allocated by
percentage to 10 GL accounts.

Inventory costs four ways. Commissions are
calculated. Prices and other attributes can
be changed once for any group of records. Easily
customized management reports
complement a bevy of old-fashioned CPA-style
worksheets.

Payroll has a direct-deposit EFT option and a
built-in utility that sends data to NPC via
the client's modem. Refunds and write-offs are
easy. So are banking transactions and
bank transfers. AR takes credit card payments.
Needed: a field for entering card
numbers.

Best feature: a data import/export facility that
makes moving to and from other easy-
transfer accounting packages (such as Peachtree
for Windows) a dream. Other bonuses:
Notes can be added anywhere. The DOS version has a
pop-up calculator and calendar.
There's a zip code database, impaired file
rebuilding and user-to-user E-mail built in.
An optional audit trail log records every
important data change by user.

Help is adequate and context-sensitive. The manual
is clear and useful. Our one big
beef: The Windows version doesn't have DDE, OLE or
ability to quick-copy onscreen
data into another Windows program. (Little
Peachtree for Windows does!)

Recommend to: growing clients who want easy-to-use
accounting software with flexible
inventory, pricing and order handling plus fast,
easy custom management reports.

BusinessWorks,

Subscriber feedback
Fixed assets fallout

Several subscribers telephoned to say they wish we
had included their write-up software
vendor's fixed assets program in last month's
comparison chart, Fixed Assets Programs
for MS-DOS and Windows (p. 112-113 in print
edition). Tell us what you're using and
we'll do it next time. Meanwhile, we'd love to
pass along your verdict to other
subscribers.

Example: CPA Terry Seiberlich whose Seiberlich
Accountancy Corp. serves two cities
in CA, writes that Creative Solutions' Fixed Asset
Solution II has CSI's usual
maddening keystroke and interface problems. "But,"
he adds, "it is relatively fast and
technically accurate, with good-to-excellent
reporting. If I were shopping today, I would
probably buy the CSI product over most of the
others."

Fixed Asset Solution II: Creative Solutions 800-
869-8900,
313-426-5860.


Call for input: For upcoming reports on paperless
audits and on imaging technology,
please fax questions and comments to 800-260-1120

Affordable bar coder tracks anything

BarCode Professional combines a tiny thermal label
printer and a pen-like scanning
wand with bar coding and item tracking software.
Result: inexpensive inventory and
asset tracking for everything from medical office
records to video rental disks. The bar
coding program supports UPC-A, Zip+4 Postnet, Code
39, Code 128 C and more.
BackTrack Express tracks by user and location and
reserves inventory.

Tip: Tell clients to substitute the maker's
BackTrack for BackTrack Express. It adds
passwording and imports and exports all inventory
data.

automatic employee improvement
suggestions in its performance reports and has
prewritten letters for correcting,
motivating and praising workers. New rating
categories include adaptability and

low-cost software that automates
employee hiring, scheduling, tracking and

Manufacturing groupware

speeds product spec changes

ConsenSys Version 4 automates document control and
revision so that mid-sized

specification changes. A document-
managing module tracks, catalogs, indexes,
distributes, and archives hard copy and
digital documents and drawings. A workflow module
routes revisions, approvals and
incorporation-and measures and reports ongoing
performance. A third module
synchronizes data for integration with MRP
systems.

The software supports popular E-mail systems and
is compliant with ISO 9000 and FDA
standards.
