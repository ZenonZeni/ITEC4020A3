SNET Applies for Statewide Cable Franchise in Connecticut, Abandons
VDT Approach

     In a rejection of the video dial-tone (VDT) model, Southern
New England Telecommunications Corp. has announced that a new
subsidiary, SNET Personal Vision, Inc., will ask the Connecticut
Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) for a statewide cable
TV franchise.  The 76-channel video offering would compete directly
with incumbent cable TV operators statewide and would offer
"competitively priced" services.

     For example, the company will offer near-video-on-demand at
"much greater frequency" than cable TV pay-per-view offerings in
the state, said Patrice Listfield, President of SNET Personal
Vision.  In addition, she said subscribers will be able to call up
movies from remote controls.  At CTR's deadline, the company was
planning to apply on Jan. 25 for the franchise.

     With the announcement, SNET becomes the latest telephone
company to reject a VDT model.  Ameritech Corp. already has signed
cable franchise agreements in several towns in its service area. 
Regarding SNET, Ms. Listfield said the company will continue its
350-subscriber VDT trial in West Hartford until that area can be
included in its cable operations.  Meanwhile, the company plans to
withdraw all its pending VDT applications at the FCC.  "We just
don't want to keep Connecticut customers waiting," she said.

     Ms. Listfield declined to say whether the company always will
price services at rates below existing cable TV rates, adding, "We
don't aim to [offer service] at higher prices."  She said SNET
Personal Vision will be the first company to bundle local exchange
service and cable TV offerings in the same package.  "We are paving
the way," she said.  "This is unprecedented."

     SNET's plan is unique because it would bypass hundreds of
potentially lengthy franchise negotiations with local governments. 
Connecticut is one of the few states that oversee cable TV
franchises at the state level.  Most states leave that authority to
individual cities.

     SNET Personal Vision will deploy a hybrid fiber optic/coaxial
cable network and hopes for DPUC approval by mid-December, Ms.
Listfield said.  She said no cross-subsidization will occur between
the company's cable and telephone operations, in accordance with
state and federal law.  The SNET Personal Vision subsidiary may use
Southern New England Telephone Co. facilities, but it will pay fees
or rent as would a separate company, she said.  Hoshang Mulla, Vice
President-network planning for SNET, said Personal Vision will
present "a very well thought out and extremely fair and proper
proposal" to the DPUC that guards against cross-subsidization.  

     He added that network upgrades in progress will boost
efficiency so much that the cost of providing telephone service can
recede as the video operations are deployed.  Mr. Mulla also said
new technology will allow the video network to continue operating
during power outages, as occurs with SNET's existing local
telephone service.

     Ms. Listfield declined to discuss possible cross-promotion
activities that could stem from SNET's combined video, local
telephone, and long distance operations, but she predicted tie-ins
between the company's business contacts from its printed directory
division and cable TV advertising sales.  "We certainly look to
capitalize on those relationships," she said.  She added that
Personal Vision will use results of the West Hartford trial to help
facilitate the cable TV deployment.

     The company said it expects its upgraded system to reach 36%
of Connecticut homes and business by the end of 1998, with 64% of
the state completed by the year 2000 and full deployment by 2009. 
That schedule coincides with the $4.5 billion upgrade plan that
SNET announced about two years ago, officials said.  Among
communities where the build-out will be complete by the end of 1998
are Bethel, Bloomfield, Branford, Bristol, Darien, East Haven,
Fairfield, Farmington, Meriden, Milford, New Britain, Norwalk, Old
Greenwich, Stamford, Stratford, Wallingford, West Hartford, and
Westport.  Also by 1998, the system will be partially complete in
Bridgeport (65%), Danbury (89%), Hartford (17%), New Haven (70%),
North Haven (79%), Plymouth (55%), Trumbull (16%), West Haven
(98%), and Weston (92%), Personal Vision said.

     Personal Vision said it expects to deploy the service in
portions of Darien, Fairfield, Norwalk, Stamford, Weston, Westport,
Farmington, New Britain, and West Hartford within "a few months"
from the time it receives regulatory approval.  In addition, SNET
plans to engage in negotiations with NYNEX Corp. in Greenwich, and
Woodbury Telephone Co. in Southbury and Bethlehem, to "develop
arrangements that will allow SNET Personal Vision to offer a cable
alternative in those areas."

AT&T's $137.5 Million Deal with DirecTV Enhances Already Powerful
Cable TV Competitor

     AT&T Corp. has acquired a 2.5% equity interest in direct
broadcast satellite (DBS) provider DirecTV, Inc., for $137.5
million.  The deal gives DirecTV marketing access to AT&T's 90
million customers and bolsters its competitive position against the
cable TV industry.  Under the deal, AT&T has the option to increase
its stake to 30% over the next five years, depending on how many
subscribers it enrolls over an unspecified period.  The deal's
price tag puts AT&T's valuation of DirecTV at $5.5 billion.  The
companies said they expect to start joint marketing by mid-1996.

     AT&T chose an equity investment over less involved partnering
schemes to "put your money where your mouth is, so this isn't just
a marketing game," said Joseph Nacchio, Executive Vice President of
AT&T's consumer-small business division.  He declined to disclose
what specific triggers would allow AT&T to increase its investment
but said there will not be another option until at least 1997.

     The purchase, which was announced Jan. 21, came two days
before AT&T was expected to bid for its own DBS license in the
FCC's auction of the remaining orbital slots at 110 and 148 degrees
West Longitude.  Mr. Nacchio said the company opted to buy into
DirecTV because obtaining its own license was expected to cost more
than $1 billion for bidding and system deployment.  

     He said it would have taken at least two years to get the
service off the ground, time that AT&T did not want to cede to
competitors.  DirecTV, on the other hand, is already established
and would allow AT&T to tap the market now, he said.

     Analysts at Merrill Lynch endorsed AT&T's approach.  They
predicted "no significant impact on earnings" but said AT&T's
equity investment strategy is "a smart and sensible way of entering
the home entertainment business."  In addition, they said the move
may have implications for cable TV companies and "makes it somewhat
more imperative" that MCI Communications Corp. step up its efforts
to bid for a DBS slot.

     In addition, AT&T and DirecTV touted the marketing
possibilities.  DirecTV President Eddy Hartenstein said AT&T will
be an "extremely powerful" outlet to promote DirecTV services and
increase its brand identity.  Mr. Nacchio promised that "a lot of
interesting marketing techniques" will come to light over the next
few months.  Plans include allowing customers to use an AT&T credit
card to finance the purchase of the 18-inch satellite dishes
required to receive DirecTV--at "very attractive" interest rates. 


     Mr. Nacchio said 12 million customers now use the card.  In
addition, AT&T will add a DirecTV sales pitch to its telemarketing
and direct sales efforts, and its retail outlets--first established
for wireless sales--will be used to sell DirecTV as well, Mr.
Nacchio said.  He said AT&T also plans regularly to promote DirecTV
in its billing literature.  

     The cable TV industry could use the deal to enhance its
argument that the FCC's "effective competition" standard--outlined
in the 1992 Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition
Act--should be changed to reflect alleged market realities, some
cable TV industry lawyers confirmed.  The industry has argued, for
instance, that the 1992 Cable Act's effective competition
definition is arbitrary and bears no relation to economic models.

     Under the current rules, a cable TV operator must prove that
a local competitor is accessible to at least 50% of the operator's
potential customers and that the competitor actually has garnered
at least 15% of the operator's current customer base.  The cable TV
industry has argued that DBS services such as DirecTV meet the 50%
standard because they are national businesses.  It has said
competitive pricing pressures occur substantially before 15% of an
incumbent operator's customers are lost.

     The FCC has signaled that it will waive rate regulation on a
case-by-case basis when the local competitive situation merits. 
Seth Davidson, a cable TV lawyer with the Washington firm of
Fleishman and Walsh, cited Bell Atlantic Corp.'s video dial-tone
activities in Dover Township, N.J., which prompted the Commission
to propose a partial waiver of the rate rules for Adelphia Cable
Communications, Inc., the incumbent cable TV operator there. 
AT&T's investment in DirecTV likely offers "one more fact that
people will point to" when cable TV operators request waivers in
the future, he said.

     A spokesman at the National Cable Television Association
(NCTA) said the AT&T investment does not signify a major milestone
in the effective competition debate, but "it makes the argument
that cable TV is operating in a competitive marketplace."  He said
important factors include the "influx of capital" that DirecTV will
receive from AT&T and the benefits of adding AT&T to its national
branding efforts.  He said, however, that the cable TV industry
remains poised to compete with national and regional entities,
noting the industry's continuing efforts to "cluster" its cable TV
operations into regional hubs capable of matching the scale of new
video competitors.

     Competition from DirecTV primarily affects the expanded basic
tier of cable TV services, Mr. Davidson said.  He noted that many
new DirecTV customers keep the lowest cable tier--often mostly
broadcast channels--in addition to DirecTV, which cannot offer
local broadcast stations.  As a result, the FCC has begun to
realize that "this doesn't have to be all or nothing" and that
expanded-tier deregulation can be an adequate relaxation of the
rate rules, he added.  As for the 15% standard, he said, "You do
respond to competitive pressure short of that threshold."  The
proposed 1995 Telecommunications Act pending in Congress would
relax expanded cable TV tier regulation when there is a telephone
company competitor, but the legislation does not contemplate the
same flexibility when there is a DBS presence, according to the
draft conference report.

     Although the basics of the AT&T-DirecTV deal are set, both
companies said several issues remain unresolved.  Mr. Hartenstein
said details "haven't been worked out" about possible changes in
arrangements with DBS satellite dish manufacturers.  It is also
unclear whether AT&T's newly spun-off equipment division will have
a manufacturing role, Mr. Nacchio said, but "we're considering it." 
Mr. Hartenstein said he expects nine or 10 dish brand names to
surface by mid-summer.  He said DirecTV also has not determined
whether the transaction will lead to changes in the service's
programming lineup or will spur a combined effort with AT&T to
provide interactive and data services.  He said negotiations are
under way regarding an online service venture but declined to give
details.  "We are well aware of the 30 million PC households," he
said.

     Some have speculated that DirecTV might strike a deal with
NBC, Inc., which recently announced a partnership with Microsoft
Corp. to turn its America's Talking cable network into a
combination news channel/online service.  Mr. Hartenstein said
DirecTV has not held "specific discussions" with NBC, but "we most
likely will."

     Cable TV industry sources said the AT&T-DirecTV announcement
will present another competitive hurdle for the industry, which has
expressed concern over DirecTV's ability to garner 1.2 million
customers in only 18 months.  Others said the deal calls into
question the assumption that AT&T eventually will use the cable TV
industry's infrastructure to resell local telephone service.  AT&T
long has criticized the local exchange access charges assessed by
telcos.  Mr. Nacchio said the deal is not expected to affect AT&T's
future relationship with the cable TV industry, which "has to deal
with the future as we have to deal with it."  He argued that AT&T
is still "an attractive partner" for cable TV companies.

     New telecommunications alliances based on one-stop-shopping
business models increasingly may force "competitors and
collaborators" to mingle, said Paul Glist, a cable TV industry
lawyer at Cole, Raywid and Braverman in Washington.  He said the
cable industry always has cited "natural alliances" with long
distance companies (although the two industries have disagreed on
significant provisions in the telecom bill now pending in
Congress).  "What does this [the AT&T-DirecTV deal] mean for the
long-term relationship?" he asked.

     As the telecommunications industry becomes more consolidated,
companies are bound to intertwine in some business areas while
competing in others, Mr. Glist said.  Another cable lawyer said the
AT&T-DirecTV deal suggests that DBS competition is "quite real. . .
[It has] a real competitive impact" and "further bolsters what
we've been saying all along" about DBS as a serious competitive
threat.  DirecTV is a unit of Hughes Electronics Corp., which is
owned by General Motors Corp.

NCTA Revives Customer Service Campaign As Competition from Telcos
Looms

     The National Cable TV Association (NCTA) has revived last
year's "on-time" guarantee program, partly to gain ground against
telephone companies, which are perceived widely as providing better
customer service as they prepare to enter video markets.  An NCTA
spokesman noted "a positive movement in the needle" of public
perception concerning the cable industry's customer service record
since the guarantee was implemented in March 1995.  He admitted,
however, that the cable TV industry still lags behind telcos in the
public's mind.  "If we were ahead, we would not be so committed to
a program like 'The Future Is on Cable,'" the industry's title of
the overall customer service campaign.  Under the program,
participating cable TV operators offer to meet appointment
"windows" or issue a $20 rebate to the customer.

     Although the customer service campaign got off to a
much-publicized start last year and was followed by a flurry of
national advertising, it has fizzled considerably in recent months. 
Not only did every broadcast network except News Corp.'s Fox refuse
to run the ads, citing competitive reasons, but the cable TV
industry has had to focus its efforts on the pending
telecommunications reform legislation.

     NCTA has announced several changes in the campaign--including
a shift from national to local advertising, with more emphasis on
local system branding to counter the greater name recognition of
the Bell companies.  The NCTA spokesman also noted that local
advertising will allow each cable TV operator to customize its
message to a specific local competitive situation.

     Char Beales, President and Chief Operating Officer of Cable &
Telecommunications:  A Marketing Society (CTAM), said during a
recent satellite teleconference that CTAM will send several
marketing and public relations kits to local system operators in
the next few weeks.  Included will be videotapes of short
commercials touting the campaign.  She urged systems to run the
shorts at least three times daily on at least 10 channel slots. 
NCTA President Decker Anstrom said the industry has not yet
conducted a "thorough market study" of its customer service
performance over the last year, but he stressed that "there's no
quick fix" to the service problems of the past.  "We don't expect
to win the whole game in the first year," he said, but the cable TV
industry needs "changes in behavior."  He said that is "the reason
we're going to beat our competition in the months and years ahead."

     John Hendricks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Discovery Communications, Inc., noted that he once chased down a
cable TV maintenance truck in an attempt to receive service.  He
said the industry needs to leave "the truck-chasing days" behind it
as competition develops.

     The NCTA spokesman said that despite the public's different
perception of the cable TV and telephone industries, most telcos
are "looking more toward those kinds of technologies that are
suited to cable-style infrastructures."

     That means the cable TV industry is ahead in terms of network
capabilities, he said.  He maintained that a cable TV company's
hybrid fiber optic/coaxial network can handle up to about 25% of
its users on the network simultaneously, while most current copper
telco lines can handle only 10%.  Although many telcos are
upgrading to fiber facilities, he said, the cable TV industry may
be able to take an early bite out of the telecom market before
telcos are up to speed.

     Mr. Hendricks said one of the first areas that cable TV
operators hope to pry from the telcos is access to online services. 
The industry has spent the last few months touting the faster data
transmission rates of cable modems when compared to current telco
alternatives (CTR, Jan. 12).  He said cable-related Web sites also
can promote local cable systems by giving online users information
about their local cable TV operators based on the users' zip codes.

Cable TV Companies Embrace Use of ATM Technology, but Not to the
Home

By Judith Freeman Mills

     About two years ago, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) was a
new technology, far from being well-known, standardized, or cheap. 
Today some major cable TV system operators are deploying ATM
switches, championing a technology developed to move vast amounts
of digital data, video, and voice communications simultaneously and
at extremely high speeds.  ATM networks can route and switch
information over a large geographic area, unlike other available
systems.

     Continental Cablevision, Inc., and Time Warner Cable have
concluded from their own experiences with ATM networks that for the
foreseeable future, ATM is the preferred, cost-effective technology
for building the backbone of a broadband digital communications
network.  But they also have concluded that ATM networks are not
the preferable connections to homes.

     Key to their conclusion is the belief that one-way video
channels, such as Cable News Network or pay-per-view offerings,
will continue to dominate consumer television.  This view also
affects their ideas about set-top boxes.  

     They believe that set-top units should be built first to
handle MPEG-II (Motion Picture Experts Group) digital video and
later adapted to handle interactive services, not the other (more
expensive) way around.

     Officials at Cable Television Laboratories, Inc. (CableLabs),
the cable TV industry's research and development arm based in
Louisville, Colo., are tracking the development of ATM technology
closely.  They continue to question when it will be fully developed
and economically sensible.

     Time Warner has 4,000 households on its state-of-the-art Full
Service Network in Orlando, Fla.  The FSN was built as a laboratory
to test services that could be available on a broadband network: 
one-way video, impulse pay-per-view programming, home shopping and
banking, computer data transmission and Internet access, video
conferencing, distance education, and local and long distance
telephone services.  The system also features ATM switching all the
way to the home.

     Based on what Time Warner has learned, the company will not
repeat the architecture, says Michael Adams, Time Warner Cable's
Senior ATM Project Engineer.  Instead, he advocates the use of ATM
technology from the headend (or "network operations center") out,
but not into residential neighborhoods as MPEG-format streams on a
now-standard hybrid fiber optic/coaxial cable network.  ATM
technology would be used only for the so-called backbone.  Mr.
Adams prefers the following architecture:

     Interactive video service providers transmit their programming
to a network operator, where it is stored on media servers or
massive computer storage banks (media servers also store movies and
other pay-per-view fare).  When needed, the programming is moved
onto the operator's core ATM switched network.

     From there the interactive digital programming enters an
Interactive Cable Gateway (ICG), the outer or ending edge of the
ATM backbone where the ATM signals are converted to an MPEG-II
format.  Separately, one-way satellite-delivered digital video
channels (such as CNN or the Discovery Channel) arrive at the
operator's headend and are sent to a Broadcast Cable Gateway. 
These signals would be in MPEG format.

     Both gateways feed into the hybrid fiber/coax network, which
then sends the transmissions into neighborhoods, through
neighborhood optical nodes, and into subscriber homes.  Under this
scenario, transmissions outside the ATM backbone network would be
in the MPEG-II format--a digital format that is becoming standard
for compression and transmission of digital video signals.  The
home set-top box would be MPEG-II; operators would not need to pay
for set-top boxes that also are capable of reading ATM streams.

     Regarding the actual architecture of the Time Warner FSN, each
interactive service provider's programming is stored on media
servers.  From the server the programming enters the system's core
ATM network and goes through an Interactive Cable Bridge (ICB),
remaining in an ATM format.  Meanwhile, satellite-delivered video
channels enter the system's Broadcast Cable Gateway.  The ICB and
the BCG pass the ATM and MPEG signals on to the fiber optic/coaxial
cable network, which connects to subscriber homes.

     Subscriber set-top boxes must deal with "both MPEG-II and ATM
transports and. . .switch between them when switching from
interactive to broadcast programming," Mr. Adams says.  The FSN
uses AT&T Network Systems' GlobeView-2000 ATM switch, which has a
maximum throughput rate of 20 gigabits per second (20 billion bits
per second).

     Under either architecture, at the end user's home or office a
set-top box and/or a separate cable modem handles necessary signal
conversions and routing to a TV set, computer, or telephone.  "Both
(architectures) can be made to work," Mr. Adams says.  "However,
for near-term deployment of cable networks, the first option is
better for economic and technical reasons."

     Ending the ATM portion of the network at the gateway makes
sense "for the pretty long term," he adds.  "So long as we have
[one-way cable TV or broadcast TV] services and lay on digital
interactive video, which we believe is the correct order, this
makes sense."  He notes, though, that the ATM Forum of senior
telecommunications engineers has been talking about wiring
individual homes with internal ATM networks.  "Pretty spacey," he
says.

     Time Warner's FSN in Orlando deploys ATM technology to the
home partly because, when the project started, MPEG-II compression
and transmission were not well defined or standardized and did not
carry data well.  "Now, it is well defined, and there is good
mapping of data," Mr. Adams notes.  "So it is pretty future-proof."

     Time Warner, Tele-Communications, Inc., and other operators
field-testing Microsoft's ATM-based Interactive Television (MITV)
system--and other network programmers and system operators as well-
-will begin transmitting signals in the advanced MPEG-II format
this year.

     Set-top boxes used by direct satellite TV systems DirecTV and
PrimeStar are "very close, if not exactly, MPEG-II capable," Mr.
Adams says.  He points out that TELE-TV, a video programming
venture involving several Bell regional holding companies, and
other companies are placing big orders for MPEG-II-capable set-top
boxes.

     Although MPEG-I and -II were developed specifically for video
streams, technical standards have been agreed upon for MPEG-II to
handle data and voice transmissions accurately, Mr. Adams says. 
Therefore, his recommended architecture could handle any service a
network operator might want to offer consumers, he notes.  (The
Orlando FSN currently is testing one-way and interactive on-demand
video programming.  It will add telephone and computer-based data
services as the project progresses.)

     Deploying an ATM network all the way to the end user might
make sense in a business park, where customers need major
multimedia, desktop videoconferencing, and other high-tech
services, Mr. Adams continues.  

     Today many local area networks serving major business parks or
corporate campuses already have ATM switches installed, making it
easy for the broadband plant operator to continue the line, he
notes.  Mr. Adams says he has no hesitation about deploying
ATM-switched backbone networks.  Today "ATM is in such good shape
in terms of standardization and interoperability," he adds.

     "ATM is installed, working, and stable, and we're glad" to be
using it, says David Fellows, Senior Vice President-engineering and
technology for Continental Cablevision.  Continental installed an
ATM backbone network to physically interconnect its New England
cable systems.  The 200-mile fiber optic infrastructure includes
Kittery, Maine; Portsmouth and Concord, N.H.; Boston, Marion,
Needham, Newton, Northampton, and Reading, Mass.; and Enfield,
Conn.  The engineering control center is in Reading.

     What had been individual system headends are now nodes on the
ATM backbone.  Continental is using Lightstream-2020 ATM switches. 
"ATM was installed in anticipation of rolling out high-speed data,"
Mr. Fellows reports.  Continental also uses its ATM network to send
digital commercials out to systems for insertion on channel
lineups, for inter-company data transmission and mail, for employee
Internet access, and for inter-company telephony.

     Video programming for the cable systems is sent on a parallel
fiber cable, not the ATM network, Mr. Fellows says.  Because the
two fiber networks were built at the same time using the same
trenches, the economic impact of adding more fiber to carry the
cable video separately was "basically not a big deal," he explains.

     Unlike Time Warner's FSN, which is running MPEG video over its
ATM network, "we're not contemplating running our core video on the
ATM network," Mr. Fellows says.  "At the moment we don't need to." 
But when demand arises for real-time interactive video services,
then "ATM is the way we think we're going to do that," he says.

     For now, Mr. Fellows agrees with Mr. Adams' conclusion that an
ATM network should end at a hybrid fiber/coax system and that all
video, data, and voice communications should be sent to residential
neighborhoods via MPEG-II transport.  He questions when, and at
what price, set-top boxes will handle both ATM and MPEG-II
transmissions.

     Continental started studying such a high-speed information
highway about two years ago.  At that time, Mr. Fellows notes, the
company explored the use of fiber digital data interconnect (FDDI)
technology, which was considered reliable.  "But it couldn't go 200
miles, so we knew at some point we would need to switch to ATM," he
says.  At that time, however, ATM was not 100% ready for
deployment.

13th Reconsideration Order Helps--and Hinders--Cable TV Rate
Regulation

By Nicholas P. Miller and Rick Ellrod--Miller, Canfield, Paddock
and Stone, P.L.C.

     The primary goal of the FCC's 13th order on reconsideration in
its cable TV rate regulation proceeding is to encourage cable TV
operators to seek rate increases annually rather than quarterly;
most operators have sought quarterly increases under previous
rules.  The FCC's Sept. 22, 1995, order added the new annual filing
method as another option in the existing rules, rather than
replacing the quarterly rules.

     For cable TV operators, the benefits of the annual rate
adjustment filing include the reduction of delays in recovering
costs and the elimination of a potential loss of revenue under the
current rules.  Another benefit is a reduction in administrative
burdens on regulators.  The benefit to subscribers is "reduced
confusion" from multiple rate increases.

     The order makes several other significant changes in rate
review, most of which appear to be favorable to cable operators. 
These changes affect regulatory procedures, review deadlines,
franchise requirements subject to pass-through, and basic and cable
programming service-tier increases.

     The 13th reconsideration order adopts an annual rate
adjustment methodology designed to permit operators to recover
projected cost increases by filing a new FCC Form 1240.  The form
was scheduled to be released in December but has been delayed
because of the recent government shutdown.  This method will allow
recovery of "reasonably certain and reasonably quantifiable"
changes in external costs, inflation, and the number of regulated
channels that are projected for the next year.

     A "true-up" mechanism will reconcile the difference between
projected and actual costs at the next annual filing.  But it also
will add another layer to the already complex rate review process
and could further complicate a franchising authority's ability to
determine whether the operator is charging reasonable rates.  The
projected costs fall into the following categories:

     *    Inflation projections will use an estimate issued by the
FCC each September, based on the preceding 12 months' inflation.

     *    External costs may be projected if they are reasonably
certain and reasonably quantifiable.  Copyright fees,
retransmission consent fees, other programming costs, FCC
regulatory fees, and cable-specific taxes are presumed to be
reasonably certain and quantifiable.

     This presumption does not affect an operator's duty to respond
to reasonable requests for information from a franchising
authority.  It also does not extend to the costs of new franchise
requirements, which may be projected only if the operator shows
that the anticipated increases are reasonably certain and
quantifiable.  The cable operator has the burden of proving that
costs are reasonably certain and quantifiable.

     *    Rate increases for projected channel additions are
generally applied once a year.  But an operator may make one
additional adjustment at any time during the year for any number of
new cable programming service (CPS) channels, or for basic channels
if there is only a single tier.  In addition, if channel additions
are required by federal or local law (that is, for "must-carry";
local origination; public, educational and governmental [PEG]
access; or leased access channels), it appears that an operator may
pass through the costs of such additions immediately.

     Costs projected in the annual adjustment are passed through to
subscribers in 12 equal monthly installments.  If an operator
elects not to pass through such costs, it may accrue them with
interest for a later rate increase.  Under the annual method, the
FCC stipulates that cable operators retain the right to increase
rates later if they do not take the increase at the beginning of
the rate year.

     Interest ceases to accrue, however, if the operator
deliberately postpones a rate increase.  The FCC has ruled in
earlier proceedings that 11.25% is presumptively the cost of
capital for cable operators, and interest will be charged at this
amount.  Curiously, the interest rate for refunds to subscribers is
still the IRS rate for tax refunds:  8%.

     In addition to reconciling projected and actual costs, the
"true-up" mechanism creates an opportunity for cable operators to
recover lost subscriber revenues when a franchising authority has
denied a rate increase that later is overturned by the FCC.  

     Until now, the FCC routinely has granted stays of local rate
orders because operators might suffer irreparable harm and could
not recover lost subscriber revenues under the current rules.  The
FCC's rationale for granting the stays has been removed, however,
because the "true-up" mechanism will allow the recovery of such
revenues.

     Equipment rates will be adjusted annually on the same date as
service-tier rates are changed.  Thus, an operator using the annual
method will file FCC Form 1205 on the same day it files Form 1240. 
However, actual past costs rather than projected costs still will
be used to determine equipment rates.

     The date of the annual adjustment normally is chosen by the
cable TV operator.  But the operator first must notify the
franchising authority of the proposed date.  If a proposed
adjustment date is unacceptable, a franchising authority may reject
it for "good cause"--for example, if the review period falls within
the period of a city council recess (a rare recognition by the FCC
of the realities of local government operations).  If the operator
and the franchising authority cannot agree on a date, the
franchising authority may set the filing date up to 60 days later
than that originally proposed by the operator.

Annual Method Involves Changes in Deadlines

     The annual method brings with it a number of procedural
changes, making it more difficult for franchising authorities to
ensure they are complying with the right deadlines.  In general,
annual rate adjustments for the basic tier are filed 90 days before
their planned effective date.  At the end of the 90-day period,
they become effective unless the franchising authority rejects them
as unreasonable, subject to later reduction and refund.

     Under the annual method, the franchising authority need not
issue an accounting order to preserve subscribers' rights to
refunds.  On the other hand, cable operators gain two new ways to
avoid refunds under the annual method:

     (1)   If an operator inquires at the end of the 90-day period
whether the franchising authority still is reviewing the rate
filing, the franchising authority must respond within 15 days or
lose its ability to order future refunds or reductions.

     (2)   If a final rate order is not issued within a year, the
franchising authority appears to lose its right to order refunds or
rate reductions.  The FCC justifies this rule by stating that "one
year should provide ample time for review."  But this may be
surprising news to those communities still waiting, after more than
two years, for the FCC's own review of their CPS rate complaints.

     If there is a material change in the operator's circumstances
during the 90-day period, it may amend its Form 1240 before the
90-day period expires.  If such an amendment is filed less than 30
days before the end of that period, the review period is extended
automatically so that the franchising authority has at least 30
days to review the amendment.  The FCC creates a number of
exceptions to the 90-day review period.  For example, franchising
authorities' review period for the extra midyear adjustment for CPS
channel additions is the same as for the regular annual adjustment
(90 days).

     However, if this midyear adjustment is for a single basic tier
(where there is no CPS tier), the review period shrinks to 60 days. 
A shortened 60-day period also applies to adjustments based on
channel additions that are required by federal or local law.  Sixty
days is also the review period for filings that create a new rate
for newly introduced equipment (submitted using a special
streamlined filing of Form 1205).

     Under current rules, if a franchising authority receives a
"facially incomplete" rate filing, it can require the operator to
submit supplemental information, and the franchising authority's
deadlines for review are tolled.  In the 13th reconsideration
order, however, the FCC says the franchising authority must notify
the operator of such facial incompleteness within 45 days from the
date of the rate filing, at least in the context of the annual
adjustment method.

CPS Rate Increases Also Affected

     Under the prior rules, an operator was not supposed to
increase CPS rates for one year after an FCC-ordered rate
reduction.  Under the annual method, however, the operator
apparently may take its annual increase (regardless of any earlier
rate reduction) by filing Form 1240 with the FCC 30 days before the
planned increase.  The increase then goes into effect subject to
later reduction and refund.

     If both basic and CPS tiers are subject to rate regulation,
the operator must file so that the 90-day period for franchising
authority review coincides with the 30-day period for FCC review. 
The exception is that the operator also may file with the FCC at
the same time it files with the franchising authority.

Fees, Requirements Subject to Pass-through

     The FCC has affirmed its earlier rule allowing operators under
the quarterly method to pass through increases in franchise fees or
FCC regulatory fees within 30 days of filing.  It appears that
under this method, the franchising authority's 30-day order
functions as an accounting order, allowing the new rates to go into
effect subject to future reduction and refund.

     In general, the 13th reconsideration order repeats that only
increases in costs for services specifically required in the
franchise documents may be passed through.  But it also adds a new
criterion:  Only increases "that the operator would not have
incurred in the absence of the franchise requirement" are passed
through.  This rule is consistent with the FCC's notion that
external costs are those beyond the operator's control.  Yet, in
stating this criterion, the FCC is admitting that the benefits
whose costs are allowed as a pass-through exist only because of
local franchising.

     The 13th reconsideration order reiterates that capital
expenditures required by a franchise must be amortized over the
useful life of the items.  But the order contributes a new wrinkle: 
Operators apparently may recover an 11.25% "return on investment"
in addition to such costs.

     The following categories of franchise requirement costs may be
passed through:  technical and customer service standards that
exceed minimum federal requirements; PEG access channels and
programming; institutional networks and the provision of video,
voice, and data services to governmental and educational
institutions; and "undergrounding," to the extent it requires
removing existing cable from poles and placing it underground.  But
increased costs for normal maintenance or simple line extensions
within the franchise area are not passed through, even if such
costs are required by the franchise documents.

Franchise Fee Refund Rules Clarified

     When an operator pays refunds to subscribers, the franchising
authority must return any franchise fee amounts that already have
been paid by the operator based on those refunds.  In the 13th
reconsideration order, the FCC clarifies this obligation by stating
that the franchising authority, not the cable operator, determines
how such franchise fees should be repaid--in a lump sum, or by
offsetting the overcharge against future franchise fee payments. 
Either method may be used as long as the overpayment is returned to
the operator within a "reasonable period of time," depending on the
amount of the overcharge and its relationship to the franchising
authority's budget.

     The order also says the franchising authority must pay
interest on the overpayment at the now-typical 11.25% rate.  This
raises the prospect that the cable operator might make a profit on
the interest, since the operator must repay the franchise fee
amounts to subscribers only at the 8% IRS refund interest rate.

     In some ways the 13th reconsideration order may improve the
rate regulation process.  Most notably a return to annual rate
changes, rather than the quarterly bombardment produced by the
original rules, should be beneficial to both subscribers and
franchising authorities.

     But the FCC has implemented these improvements in a way some
believe is guaranteed to produce further complexity and more
loopholes and disputes.  Moreover, the introduction of several new,
shorter deadlines for special situations will require franchising
authorities to be even more careful to avoid running afoul of one
of the FCC's "sand traps," thus losing the right to overturn
"unreasonable" rates.

Bell Atlantic Enters Final Phase of Dover Township Video Dial-Tone
Test

     Four weeks into its eight-week video dial-tone (VDT) trial in
Dover Township, N.J., Bell Atlantic Corp. has entered the second
and final phase designed to "stress" VDT capabilities and test
basic interactivity.  While the first stage emphasized support
services such as ordering, installation, and general
troubleshooting, the second phase will concentrate on entertainment
programming, "basic interactive functions" (e.g., pay-per-view),
and "text interactivity" (e.g., on-screen ordering of premium
services), a Bell Atlantic spokesman said.  He clarified, however,
that the second phase will not include full interactive functions
such as video-on-demand.

     FutureVision, which is the only one of seven "video
information providers" that have reserved capacity on the
384-channel network to offer programming, will increase its channel
selection and test new concepts during the second phase. 

     Bell Atlantic "did learn some things" about video delivery
during the first phase, including that subscribers experienced "a
short delay" when switching channels, the spokesman said.  He said
the company plans to fix that problem during the second phase by
distributing software upgrades to its subscribers.

     In addition, he said Bell Atlantic has set up voice mail boxes
through its local telephone operations so that subscribers can keep
the company abreast of network problems as they occur.  

     Bell Atlantic also has used the voice mail system to remind
subscribers when specific tests will occur (for example, if the
company wanted to test its pay-per-view capacity by directing a
large number of people to order movies at the same time).

     "We keep in close contact with the volunteers," the spokesman
said.  "We know some of these people by name."  He claimed that
most subscribers prefer Bell Atlantic's digital signal over
incumbent cable TV operator Adelphia Communications Corp.'s current
analog transmissions.  He also noted that many people have remained
on the waiting list to test the VDT network.

     Adelphia has not made a point of questioning Bell Atlantic's
claims of better signal quality, said Randy Fisher, Adelphia
VP-General Counsel.  But the company's interviews with subscribers
testing Bell Atlantic's network indicate "there's not much
difference" between Adelphia's current analog signal and the
telco's digital picture, he said.  "It's a good picture, but it's
not so good as to drive a wooden stake into our heart," he said. 
He suggested that price, service, and network reliability
ultimately will determine which company wins customers, noting that
Adelphia still plans to vie for Bell Atlantic's telephony
customers.

     In the meantime, Mr. Fisher said, Adelphia speedily is
deploying fiber in an attempt to upgrade its network fully by the
time Bell Atlantic rolls out commercial VDT service.  The Bell
Atlantic spokesman said that will occur "in the near future" but
declined to specify a date.  Mr. Fisher noted that digital
transmission still has problems, such as its apparent inability to
handle picture-in-picture TV functions.  So it is still unclear
whether Adelphia will convert to a digital signal once it completes
the upgrade, which Mr. Fisher said is about 60% done.  Industry
working groups have not yet set a digital standard.

Bell Atlantic Defends Dover VDT Tariff

     Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic has filed reply comments with the FCC
defending its VDT tariff for Dover Township.  It accused the cable
TV industry of a "campaign of fear and intimidation, as well as
regulatory gamesmanship" that has "led many carriers to conclude
that the game is not worth the candle:  Rather than pursue the open
network vision, they are wearily agreeing simply to be cable
clones."

     Ameritech Corp., for one, publicly has abandoned the VDT model
and continues to pursue cable TV franchises around the country. 
Bell Atlantic told the Commission that its proposed VDT rates do
cover the cost of providing VDT service, despite the cable TV
industry's claims that they could promote cross-subsidization.  It
also reiterated that the terms and conditions of its VDT tariff are
"commercially reasonable and nondiscriminatory."  Bell Atlantic has
received FCC authority to deploy a VDT network in Dover Township.

     GTE Corp. also has weighed into the Dover Township
controversy.  GTE opposed the FCC's approval of Adelphia's request
for a waiver of the cable rate regulation rules.  Adelphia had made
the request in light of Bell Atlantic's impending VDT deployment. 
GTE said the waiver may do "more to enhance and perpetuate an
asymmetric scheme of regulation than to promote true competition"
and urged the FCC to relax VDT rules as well "so that competition
can flourish."

Time Warner Steps Up Ohio Fight Over Interconnection with Ameritech

     Time Warner Communications has taken a dispute over
interconnection with Ameritech-Ohio one step further, asking the
Ohio Public Utilities Commission to suspend the telephone company's
alternative regulation plan.  Citing its unsuccessful attempt to
negotiate interconnection rates and terms with the telco, Time
Warner has asked the PUC to suspend the intrastate price cap plan
that gave Ameritech broad regulatory flexibility.  Ameritech
responded by calling Time Warner's request "desperate" and
"ridiculous" and accusing the cable TV company of seeking to
"derail" its plans to provide competitive cable TV service.

     Time Warner received authorization last year to provide local
exchange telephony in the 37 counties in which it operates cable TV
systems, pending the development of comprehensive local competition
rules in the state (CTR, Sept. 8, 1995).  But Time Warner and
Ameritech have disagreed on interconnection terms, prompting the
cable TV company late last month to seek PUC mediation of their
negotiations (CTR, Jan. 12).  Time Warner made that request in its
second 60-day report to the commission on the status of those
negotiations.

     Time Warner and Ameritech representatives have met four times
since the mediation request was filed; PUC staff members attended
two of those meetings, Time Warner said.  It filed the motion
because of a "distinct lack of progress despite those efforts,"
said Marsha Schermer, Time Warner Vice President-regulatory
affairs.

     Ameritech was allowed to operate under the alternative
regulation plan because of the onset of local exchange competition,
Ms. Schermer said.  But the telco has taken advantage of the plan,
she added, acting as "virtually an unregulated monopoly, in control
of when and how they get competition."  Time Warner sought
suspension of certain aspects of the regulation plan.

     Ameritech said, however, that "substantive agreements" on many
technical and economic issues have been reached.  But Time Warner
has increased its demands every time the parties near agreement,
said James C. Smith, VP-regulatory for the telco.  He said
Ameritech, which has reached interconnection pacts with six
competitors, has been a "leader" in negotiating such agreements. 
Time Warner has "no incentive to reach an interconnection
agreement," because its "real motive is to delay competition in the
monopoly cable TV market," Mr. Smith said.

     Even if an interconnection agreement is reached, Time Warner
"doesn't seem to be ready to provide generally available local
telephone service in Ohio," he added.  "There are widespread
reports that Time Warner has not been able to deliver generally
available local telephone service in Orlando, Fla., and Rochester,
N.Y."  By contrast, Ameritech is prepared to provide cable TV
services in several Ohio communities, Mr. Smith stated.

     AT&T Corp. has weighed in with support of Time Warner's
motion, citing similar difficulties in negotiating interconnection
terms with Ameritech in Illinois and Michigan.

     Meanwhile, Time Warner has asked the Wisconsin Public Service
Commission for authority to provide switched local exchange
services in that state.  The company plans initially to serve large
and small businesses but eventually will serve residential end
users.  Time Warner also plans to offer (1) video-on-demand, (2)
high-speed access to on-line services and the Internet, (3) home
shopping, and (4) interactive video service.  In Wisconsin it plans
to build a 15,000-mile fiber optic network featuring 24-hour
"system surveillance," redundancy based on synchronous optical
network (SONET) technology, and a fiber optic backbone
architecture.

Pacific Bell Reports Video Dial-Tone Construction Delays in Some
Cities

     Pacific Bell has hit a snag in its attempt to build video
dial-tone (VDT) networks in 24 California cities--namely, most of
the cities themselves, said a Pacific Telesis Group spokesman. 
Although Pacific Bell has received construction approval in San
Jose, he noted, internal disputes between city officials and
concerns over potential disruptions to the public rights-of-way
have delayed local construction approval in most of the other 23
localities.

     In San Jose, Pacific Bell already has wired 200 homes for a
free "technology test."  With a hybrid fiber optic/coaxial network
now passing about 315,000 homes, the company hopes to expand the
trial into a commercial rollout, he said.  "We think it's
definitely going to work," he said, but local "government
ponderousness" is "holding up the network. . .We're stymied."

     Most of the disagreements have centered on money, the Pacific
Telesis spokesman said.  "Initially, they opened their arms," he
said, but then "the dollar signs started to click in their eyes"
and demands for public access channel slots, local fees, and other
forms of revenue surfaced.  The result, he said, is that some
cities purposely are holding Pacific Bell up "in order to shake us
down."

     The company has offered short-term fee arrangements until a
final federal telecom bill clarifies its local responsibilities,
the spokesman continued.  But some cities have demanded long-term
commitments now.  He conceded, however, that cities have a
legitimate concern when it comes to construction schedules, noting
that "we're not the only company that's asking to dig up the
streets."

     The problem for both cities and prospective VDT service
providers is that VDT "is in some flux" because of the pending
federal telecom legislation, said Eileen Huggard, Executive
Director of the National Association of Telecommunications Officers
and Advisors (NATOA).  She said cities want VDT construction to
mesh with other local projects or construction requests in a way
that does not excessively inconvenience local residents.  But
guidelines are unclear because of the pending bill.  "That's part
of why it's a difficult time right now," she said.  "It's trying to
plan for something that could change in a week or two weeks or a
few months."

     Other telcos have reported similar snags but continue to study
what they hope will be a lucrative video marketplace.  A
spokeswoman for U S WEST, Inc., said U S WEST Communications'
ongoing VDT trial in Omaha is in "full swing," with more than 8,000
customers now signed up despite "almost no promotional support." 
Most new customers over the last few months have surfaced because
of favorable reports about the initial technical trial that began
last year, she said.

     U S WEST is not ready to announce any new trial locations, she
said, but "we're definitely looking for trends" in Omaha--including
price sensitivity and whether service usage is seasonal.

Disney-CapCities Merger Plans Clear Department of Justice Hurdle

     The Walt Disney Co. and Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., have
surmounted a major hurdle to Disney's proposed acquisition of
CapCities (CTR, Aug. 11, 1995).  The Justice Department's Antitrust
Division has approved the merger proposal following Disney's
announcement that it will sell KCAL-TV, its Los Angeles television
station.  Disney is a partner in the Americast joint video
programming venture with Ameritech Corp., BellSouth Corp., SBC
Communications, Inc., and GTE Corp.  Some industry observers expect
the FCC to rule on the transfer of TV licenses related to the
proposed CapCities deal at a tentatively scheduled Jan. 31 meeting.

     The expected sale of KCAL-TV "resolves any potential antitrust
concerns that could arise from Disney's acquisition of KABC-TV, a
Los Angeles television station currently owned by Capital
Cities/ABC," Justice said.  

     The Antitrust Division had been investigating whether Disney's
ownership of both KCAL-TV and KABC-TV might lead to reduced
competition and higher TV advertising rates in Los Angeles.  Before
that investigation concluded, however, Disney notified Justice that
it planned to sell KCAL-TV.  It also pledged to maintain KCAL-TV
and KABC-TV as "separate, competing stations until the sale is
completed," Justice said.

     To help ensure that the sale of the station occurs and to
protect KCAL-TV competitors before the sale, Disney agreed to sign
a consent decree requiring the appointment of a trustee to carry
out the sale.  

     The decree will be filed in court only if Disney (1) fails to
enter into a definitive agreement within nine months to sell
KCAL-TV, (2) fails to complete the sale of KCAL-TV in 12 months,
and (3) seeks FCC authority to own both KCAL-TV and KABC-TV
permanently.

     Disney originally had sought a temporary waiver of FCC rules
that prevent broadcasters from owning two VHF stations in a single
market, saying that enactment of the pending telecommunications
legislation might render such ownership of broadcast stations
legal.  Disney now wants the Commission to approve the temporary
waiver request so it can operate both stations until the planned
divestiture of KCAL-TV is complete, a Disney spokesman said.

     Justice also examined "all potential competitive effects"
stemming from the planned CapCities transaction, including the
effect of combining the video production and distribution
businesses of Disney and CapCities, the department said.  

     It concluded that "such a combination would not violate the
antitrust laws."  Earlier this month Disney and CapCities
shareholders overwhelmingly approved the planned acquisition of
CapCities (CTR, Jan. 12).

SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND TELEPHONE CUTS MULTIMEDIA DIVISION

     Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. (SNET) has
confirmed that it will whittle from 75 to 28 the number of
employees in its Multimedia Division as it continues to merge the
remainder of the staff into its expanding publishing operations. 
A SNET spokeswoman said the company had "overstaffed" its
multimedia group because of early industry predictions that a
digital video standard would exist by mid-1995.  Because of the
current lack of a standard and uncertainty over when one will
exist, she said, SNET has determined that "it's premature to be
working on digital at this time. . .We could roll out digital
technology tomorrow, but it likely would be throwaway technology."

     Most of the displaced 47 workers will be transferred to other
areas of the company, she said, but some may be let go
indefinitely.  She was quick to stress that the multimedia staff
cuts are not a signal that SNET is backing away from digital video
technology.  The staff reduction, she said, is attributable
partially to synergies realized after the division was merged with
the publishing unit, requiring fewer people to do the work.  The
SNET publishing unit, which traditionally has overseen the
company's printed directories, has expanded into online ventures in
recent months, increasing its relevance to multimedia.

DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES

     The cable TV industry is facing "aggressive competition" as
new digital technologies allow companies to enter traditional cable
TV markets, according to a report by the Multimedia Research Group. 


     MRG says "quadrature amplitude modulation" (QAM) and
"quadrature phase shift key" (QPSK) technologies, along with the
development of Motion Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) standards, have
allowed direct broadcast satellite and multichannel multipoint
distribution service providers to achieve "stunning success,"
resulting in "unexpected new opportunities."

DirecTV BEEFS UP SATELLITE NETWORKS

     DirecTV, Inc., has announced an agreement with PrimeTime 24,
its a la carte network feed service, to add the NBC station in Los
Angeles, San Francisco's CBS affiliate, and the ABC station in
Seattle.  PrimeTime 24's offerings now include the ABC and NBC
affiliates in New York City; the CBS affiliate in Raleigh, N.C.;
the Fox station in Chicago; and the PBS network in Denver.  The
expanded service became available on Jan. 17 for $4.95 per month. 


     The cable TV industry has criticized direct broadcast
satellite (DBS) service in the past because it does not carry local
broadcast networks.  PrimeTime 24 President Chuck Griege said the
addition of the West Coast affiliates will increase viewing
flexibility by allowing subscribers to "take advantage of time zone
differences."  Meanwhile, DirecTV also announced that it has
authorized Matsushita Electric Corp. to manufacture DBS receivers
through its Panasonic brand, but the terms were not disclosed. 
DirecTV is a division of Hughes Electronics Corp.

ATM TECHNOLOGY:  A CLOSER LOOK

     Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) refers to a switching and
transport technology developed to transmit digital voice, video,
and data traffic simultaneously and in either direction, offering
both high speed and cost-effectiveness.  

     ATM transfer is based on moving information units, called
cells.  Digital information enters a broadband system as packets,
which are much larger than cells.  The ATM switch takes all the
incoming packets, mixes them up and cuts them into cells.  It then
sends the cells down the fiber cable in a configuration and at a
bandwidth picked to gain the most efficient transmission.  The
ATM-determined path is known as a virtual channel.

     At the destination, another ATM switch takes the cells and
recreates the original packets of voice, video, or data
information.  The packets then leave the ATM switch and travel down
fiber and coaxial cables to their destination:  a specific home
computer, television, or telephone.

     When ATM-protocol communications enter an MPEG-II broadband
cable network, they are converted out of ATM format and the ATM
signals are mapped onto MPEG.  On an all-ATM system such as Time
Warner's Orlando FSN, ATM transmissions are decoded and routed to
their final TV, computer, or telephone by a set-top box.

TCI, CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT

     Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI) and Continental Cablevision,
Inc., have announced a definitive agreement to trade assets
covering about 200,000 subscribers in Massachusetts, Missouri, and
Illinois.  Continental will take over TCI systems serving about
100,000 customers in areas surrounding Andover, Cape Cod, Waltham,
and Nantucket, Mass.  TCI in turn will gain Continental's
operations in several St. Louis suburbs and systems in Belleville
and Scott Air Force Base, Ill.  The deal further clusters TCI's
operations in St. Louis, where it already covers the metropolitan
area.

     William Schleyer, Continental's President and Chief Executive
Officer, said the addition of the Massachusetts systems will help
the company cluster more operations in the Northeast, where its
largest customer base is located.  The terms of the agreement were
not disclosed.

INTERCONNECTION DEAL

     Teleport Communications Group, Inc., and Pacific Bell have
reached an interconnection agreement allowing Teleport to begin
offering switched local exchange service in California.

     Teleport, a competitive access provider, is owned by
Tele-Communications, Inc., Continental Cablevision, Inc., Cox
Enterprises, and Comcast Corp.  The pact is the first Pacific Bell
has reached with a competitor since the California Public Utilities
Commission released interconnection guidelines last month.

     Although the agreement on technical interconnection
arrangements will allow local exchange competition to begin, it
does not resolve every issue that is a "prerequisite to real,
effective local exchange competition," including unbundling and
database-driven number portability, said Michael Morris, Teleport
Regional Director-regulatory and external affairs.

KENTUCKY COURT UPHOLDS DENIAL OF CABLE FRANCHISE RENEWAL 

     The U.S. District Court of Owensboro, Ky., has issued an order
that may become the first test of franchise renewal protections for
cable TV operators as outlined in the 1984 Cable Act.  Provisions
of that law, many of which withstood modifications in the 1992
Cable Act, made it very difficult for cities to deny franchise
renewal requests.

     The court upheld the refusal of the city of Sturgis, Ky., to
renew the local franchise of Union CATV, Inc., a 2,500-subscriber
cable TV company with two systems--in Morganfield and Sturgis.  In
Sturgis, where the company has about 700 customers, the parties
could not agree on the city's "future cable-related community needs
and interests," the court said.

     Union CATV President Alan Reed said he plans to appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Cincinnati as soon as the lower court
decides whether to grant a stay, which would allow the company to
continue operations pending the outcome of the appeal.  "We're
looking for a quick turnaround here," he said.  The Kentucky Cable
TV Association may file an amicus brief in the case, a spokeswoman
said.

CBS PONDERS CABLE NEWS 

     CBS, Inc., is toying with starting a cable news network, a CBS
spokesman has confirmed.  Reports surfaced earlier this month that
the historically cable-phobic company might start a news channel
after Michael Jordan, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Westinghouse Electric Co., signaled interest during an interview on
NBC, Inc.'s cable channel, CNBC.  

     Westinghouse announced it would purchase CBS for $5.3 billion
in August 1995.  Peter Lund, President of CBS Broadcast Group,
recently expressed interest in cable TV services (CTR, Oct. 6,
1995, p. 13) but has not been specific about possible content.
