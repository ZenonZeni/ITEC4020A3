The Commonwealth Spatial Data Committee (CSDC) was established in 1992,
as the peak co-ordinating body to address Commonwealth spatial data matters,
including a whole of government approach to data exchange policy for environmental
data under the Inter- Governmental Agreement on the Environment between
the Commonwealth and the States. The resultant Commonwealth Public Interest
Spatial Data Transfer Policy and the Guidelines for Commonwealth Data Custodians
cover, respectively, the exchange principles and the operational procedures
recommended for Commonwealth agencies which deal with data collected, either
under Ministerial direction or via a legislative basis, with the intention
of making them public. <BR>
<BR>
The CSIRO Office of Space Science &amp; Applications represents CSIRO interests
on the CSDC. <BR>
<BR>
At a Federal level, Commonwealth and State views on land-related data exchange
(including price and third-party disclosure provisions) are aggregated by
the Australia and New Zealand Land Information Council (ANZLIC). ANZLIC,
through a process of consultation with data users, has developed a set of
fundamental attributes for describing datasets (the Core Metadata Elements).
This core list of descriptors is similar to the Directory Interchange Format
[DIF] used by international spatial data centres to make a self-sufficient
entry into a Directory - an annotated list of data sets and contact information.
<BR>
<BR>
The National Resource Information Centre (NRIC) maintains the National Directory
of Australian Resources (NDAR) to support decision making within the Department
of Primary Industries and Energy. NRIC has agreed to maintain a Directory
of Commonwealth spatial data sets on behalf of the CSDC, and this will become
a major component of NDAR. NRIC is currently re-developing NDAR and access
allowing simple search strategies is available on-line via the NRIC&iacute;s
web site.

DIRECTORIES OF DATA COLLECTIONS<BR>
<BR>
The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), of which CSIRO is
chair, has been developing Internet-based data directories for several years.
The CEOS International Directory Network (IDN) permits location of Earth
and space science data sets through over 15 participating directory nodes
around the world. This effort is conducted through the CEOS Working Group
on Information Systems and Services, with CSIRO participation co-ordinated
through COSSA, the Australian CEOS Plenary member. <BR>
<BR>
The CEOS Working Group on Information Systems and Services has also developed
software tools through which data custodians can generate Directory Interchange
Format (DIF) entries to log information about their datasets onto the International
Directory Network. <BR>
<BR>
COSSA has established an Australian co-operating node for this network,
which will enable users to access a full copy of the Global Master Directory
maintained by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, as well as any additional
Australian directory entries. Local installation of the Master Directory
<BR>
has the advantage of much reduced network access time, and lower communication
cost to users. <BR>
<BR>
COSSA would welcome approaches from other Divisions/Units interested in
having an International Directory entry for their spatially related datasets.
This entry (but not necessarily the dataset itself) would be available to
national or international inquirers. It is important to note that this step
would simply provide basic information about the nature of the data set
(time period, sensors used, availability criteria, contact details, etc.).
Control of the dataset would remain with the custodian Division/unit. <BR>
<BR>
We could also undertake conversion of such entries into a form usable by
the National Directory being developed by NRIC. This step would help streamline
interaction with between NRIC and CSIRO. We also discussing, with NRIC,
establishing a link between NDAR and the IDN, so that a user accessing the
IDN could conveniently cross to NDAR. <BR>
<BR>
The group on industrialised economies, G7, has established a prototype Environment
and Natural Resources Management Global Information Locator service (ENRM
GIL), which builds upon the work of CEOS and individual space agencies.
This is a free of charge pilot project based at the European Commission&iacute;s
Centre for Earth Observation. Software from this program is being incorporated
into an Information Locator Service pilot project being led by the German
Space Agency, DARA, and directed primarily at developing countries. COSSA
is participating in this project, through CEOS. The value of these efforts
lies in increasing CSIRO access to important research data from developing
countries (such as that relating to local impact of global and climate change),
as well as in allowing developing countries to improve their own research
capabilities.<BR>
<BR>
ACCESS TO DATA AND INFORMATION<BR>
<BR>
NASA is building a comprehensive system for managing images and related
data products from its Earth Observing System of satellites. The initial
version of this system allows on-line searching [by various strategies including
date, sensor, latitude/longitude range and place name], browse, inventory
management, and ordering. These functions go several steps beyond the Directory
functions of the IDN or NDAR, since they permit actual examination of the
information (for example, images from Earth observing satellites), prior
to an authorised user logging a request for on or off-line delivery of the
chosen data. <BR>
<BR>
In collaboration with NASA, COSSA will soon install a copy of the Earth
Observing System&iacute;s data management system, initially primarily for
inventory control of NOAA AVHRR images from the Global 1 Km AVHRR Land Data
project, and for managing other satellite data set corporate assets. <BR>
<BR>
Both the data management system and the International Directory Network
node at COSSA will be demonstrated at the CEOS Plenary, to be chaired by
CSIRO in Canberra this November. These demonstrations, managed by the Division
of Information Technology, will also include aspects of real-time transmission
of global satellite data and distributed data processing techniques. <BR>
<BR>
CSIRO Earth Observation Centre<BR>
<BR>
Dr David Jupp, the Centre&iacute;s Science Leader, will be initiating a
number of research planning workshops over the next few months. The Centre&iacute;s
Strategic Science Plan includes a Data Systems focus, and this will benefit
from many of the initiatives discussed above. Through workshops and other
discussions involving participating Divisions, specific research tasks will
be developed in an effort to further improve the quality of remotely sensed
data products, and to increase their usefulness both to CSIRO and the wider
community. <BR>
