<A HREF="CoopRef#Holubec">Holubec (1992)</A> writes "Often teachers jump into cooperative learning and find the waters are much deeper than expected. Their students complain, refuse to work, copy rather than learn, and socialize. As the teachers struggle back to shore, they may decide that staying on the bank is better than the possibility of going under ... Just as they did not learn to swim by jumping into deep water, they and their students probably will not learn cooperative learning by jumping headlong into it" (p. 181).<BR>
<BR>
Teachers may find the following tips helpful:
<UL>
<LI> Discuss cooperative behaviors with students (e.g., When groups are working really well, what are people in them doing?).<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Group size should be small (i.e., when students work well in pairs, they can graduate to threes).<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Teachers should choose the groups either by having students randomly count off or by assigning heterogeneous pairs.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Working alone is not a choice. Teachers should encourage and support the partners of reluctant students. In order to get a student interest in having a partner, sometimes it works to structure some fun or difficult work, where partners are a definite advantage.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Initial cooperative activities should be of short duration (approx. 5' to 10'). Students should not be given anything that takes any longer until they are working successfully in the allotted time.<BR>
</UL>
Teachers need enough training and practice on the <A HREF="CoopLearn">essential elements</A> of cooperation to become educational engineers who can take their existing lessons, curricula, and courses and structure them cooperatively. Well-structured cooperative learning lessons are differentiated from poorly structured ones on the basis of these elements.

<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Gaining Expertise</H3>

Teachers need to progressively refine their competencies in using cooperative learning by:
<OL>
<LI> <A HREF="CoopPlan">Planning</A> and <A HREF="CoopLesson">teaching</A> a cooperative lesson.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their lesson.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Reflecting on how to better teach the next lesson (thus clarifying the teacher's conceptual understanding).<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Planning and teaching a second cooperative lesson with the modifications suggested by the feedback received about the first.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their second lesson, reflecting on how to better teach the next lesson better, and teaching the third lesson, etc.<BR>
</OL>
