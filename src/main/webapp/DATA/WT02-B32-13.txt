<p>
This course is suitable for honours graduates in agriculture, biological science and chemistry, but graduates in other disciplines will be considered for admission. The course has a modular structure which allows students who are unable to study for one year full-time to complete the course over a period not exceeding three years.<P>

The syllabus covers the application of biotechnology to the production and processing of foodstuffs and also to agricultural systems. It includes an introduction to the principles of process engineering, and the study of selected aspects of microbiology and genetics, bioreactor design, applied enzymology, product recovery and downstream processing, food biotechnology and agricultural biotechnology. Students pursue advanced study in either food biotechnology or agricultural biotechnology or the treatment of food and agricultural wastes. They participate in a number of case studies. Students report on a research project which may be carried out in collaboration with industry or with one of the research institutions associated with the University. <P>
AFRC advanced course studentships are currently available for this course.<P>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

Assessment consists of course and practical work, a written examination and a project report or dissertation.<P>
