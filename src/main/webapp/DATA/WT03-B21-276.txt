<DD><FONT SIZE=6>RECYCLING</FONT>

<DD>The technology now exists to upgrade wastewater to meet standards for
domestic use, and wastewater recycling is certain to become an increasingly
important source of new water in the coming decades in many areas. Although
public resistance is still a barrier to the use of reclaimed water for
drinking, recycling for other uses is more and more common. California, the
leading consumer of recycled water in the United States, uses about 325,000
acre-feet of recycled water annually for industrial cooling, groundwater
recharge, barriers against salt-water intrusion, and irrigating landscapes,
parks, golf courses, and certain crops.

<DD>The economics of recycling are driven in large part by the environmental
and health regulations that dictate how communities collect and treat waste
water. It costs about $430-$490 to recycle an acre-foot of water, which is
several times what most cities paid to develop existing supplies. About
three-fourths of the cost of recycling wastewater is incurred meeting
federal requirements that effluent discharged into waterways undergo
certain minimal treatment. The marginal costs of the additional
purification needed to make the water suitable for unrestricted
agricultural use and of storing and conveying the upgraded water to the
user are only about $125 per acre-foot, which is competitive with
alternative sources of new supplies in many areas.

<DD><FONT SIZE=6>DESALINATION</FONT>

<DD>Almost unlimited quantities of sea water are available to coastal areas,
and brackish waters containing salt levels too high for most uses are
available in many aquifers and inland seas. The cost of desalination
depends on the quantity of salts removed. It is less expensive if the
process starts with brackish water -- with salt concentrations well below
the 35,000 parts per million characteristic of sea water -- and if the
finished water is not treated to meet drinking water standards.
Technological advances have reduced desalting costs as much as 50 percent
during the last three decades, and future improvements may have the
potential of still further reductions. Still, desalination of sea water
today costs about $1,800 an acre-foot, and is energy-intensive, making it a
supply of last resort. Brackish water, on the other hand, might be upgraded
to drinking-water for less than half this cost.

<DD><FONT SIZE=6>Other potential sources of supply</FONT>

<DD>Weather modification through cloud seeding, though controversial, is still
seen by some as a promising, low-cost way to increase water supplies in
arid and semiarid areas. While the impact of seeding on precipitation
remains difficult to measure, winter orographic clouds (formed by
encounters with elevated features such as mountain ranges) have been seeded
in areas of the western United States for nearly half a century, increasing
seasonal precipitation in some areas, by some reports, by about 10 percent.
Recent research suggests that other seeding materials might condense
precipitation from clouds of higher temperatures and thus in other seasons.

<DD>Proponents argue that in areas with favorable conditions cloud seeding can
supplement water supplies for about $10 an acre-foot. But even if the
technology is improved and the economics are favorable, the potential
impact on water supplies is likely to be small and geographically limited.
Moreover, legal barriers may restrict its use. Towns receiving more snow
might object to higher snow- removal costs; downstream residents might
suffer increased spring flooding; and downwind communities might feel that
they are being deprived of precipitation that otherwise would have fallen
on them.

<DD>Vegetation management, such as removing phreatophytes (high-water-use
plants that thrive along streams, such as trees of the willow family) or
managing forests for increased water yields, could increase water supplies
in some areas. The financial costs of vegetation management may be
competitive with other supply augmentation alternatives, but environmental
concerns may limit its use: phreatophyte removal is likely to have adverse
effects on wildlife habitat, and managing forests for increased water
yields may conflict with commercial timber production and recreational
opportunities.

<DD>Growing water scarcity in the arid and semiarid West has fostered a number
of bold proposals to utilize the enormous quantities of water stored in
polar ice  or to divert northern rivers in the largely uninhabited
areas of Canada and Alaska. However, the technical, economic, legal, and
environmental obstacles to transporting and using icebergs to supplement
water supplies in an area such as southern California currently appear
insurmountable. The enormous financial and environmental costs of proposals
such as the North American Water and Power Alliance that would transport
110 million acre-feet of water annually (about eight times the average
annual flow of the Colorado River) from Alaska and northern Canada to the
western United States and northern Mexico have relegated them to the realm
of science fiction for the foreseeable future.

<DD>Ideally, in a system of hydroelectric plants, water should be allocated to
the units in time intervals that allow each unit to be operated at the most
efficient output (kW/cfs) for the prevailing head. The system's required
hydroelectric generation is produced from the cluster of units by
staggering the individual times of operation. This will maximize the
hydraulic energy that can be obtained from the available quantity of water.

<DD>To achieve this level of efficient operation the volumes of water must be
compatible with the unit characteristics. Management of water resources is
closely integrated with power scheduling. Reservoir inflow forecasts are
part of the optimization for generation scheduling and unit commitments.

<DD>Integrated optimization of water management and power scheduling provides
efficiency improvements comparable to machinery upgrades. These
improvements arise directly from the widespread use of easy to use, low
cost desktop computing, and inexpensive hydrologic monitoring and data
transmission facilities.

<FONT SIZE=6>Decision Support Systems</FONT>

<DD>Improvements in water and power management have been delayed by the
apparent complexity of the water and power systems. In practice this
difficulty now has been minimized by adept use of real-time data and
software that is tailored to serve the people making the operating
decisions. This type of computer system is a "decision support system". The
heart of a decision support system is the computer interface to data
management, forecasting, current system status, and optimization routines.

<DD>SCADA installations provide real-time displays of the operating status of
equipment. Decision support systems go one step further. They show the
hydrologic and load forecast of what will happen soon, with suggestions for
scheduling the hydroelectric facilities.

<DD>Decision support systems are made practical by access to powerful windows
based compilers that incorporate dynamic data exchange with SCADA software,
and object linking embedded among concurrently running programs. These
programming capabilities provide the power system operator with customized
software that incorporates the relational data base, graphics, and simple
mouse driven controls into the programs that develop the operating
recommendations.

<DD>The decision support system develops recommendations by optimization within
regulatory constraints, physical limitations of the facilities, and
environmental and economic objectives.

<DD>Decision support systems provide shift superintendents and power schedulers
with quickly responsive and easy to use automatic integrated optimization
of water control and generation. Trial and error is eliminated, and
consistency among operators, and efficient utilization of water, is
achieved.

<FONT SIZE=6>Hydrologic Forecasting</FONT>

<DD>Realistic forecasts utilize a conceptual hydrologic model to track soil
moisture, ground water discharge, and snow conditions on the watershed, and
propagation of flood waves through the river system. The model is driven by
weather and river data recorded at key locations and transmitted via land
line, radio, or satellite directly to the power operations decision support
system. In North America, these types of data are accessible from a
commercial satellite.

<DD>Hydrologic forecasts are embedded in the decision support system, and are
virtually automatic. Before passing the forecast on to the operations
analysis, the operator uses the decision support system to interpret the
forecast and to assess its reliability.

<FONT SIZE=6>Scheduling for Reregulation by Channel Routing</FONT>

<DD>For plants having minimal storage, the hourly schedule for the units at
upstream plants in a cascade must be timed so that at downstream plants the
units can be loaded efficiently. The decision support system's knowledge of
the hydrodynamic behaviour of the river between may be a key factor.

<DD>Scheduling to avoid spill requires integration of generating unit
characteristics and hydrology. Even small pools provide opportunity for
reregulation. In a cascade of dams, the optimal dispatch of individual
generating units should incorporate accurate routing and forecasts of local
inflow between pools. This is most important when peaking operations cause
hydraulic transients in the river channel.

<DD>Calibrated routing equations are tailored to practical needs. Optimization
automatically schedules the unit dispatch and/or spillway gate operations
to use the dynamic storage in channel networks and the limited storage in
small pools between the dams.

<DD>Operating decisions for systems of interconnected reservoirs will optimize
the timing of releases to match forecasted local inflow hydrographs, the
characteristics of the river channels, and the efficiency performance of
the generating units.

<FONT SIZE=5>
<FONT SIZE=6>Complexity Provides Flexibility</FONT>

<DD>Water scheduling is wasteful if it does not consider generating units
scheduling. The voluntary constraint from non-integrated management is most
important if there are only a few units in the powerhouse, or if the
operational storage is small in the downstream pools. In principle,
voluntary constraints become less important if a larger integrated system
of rivers, reservoirs, and generating units, can be dispatched together in
an optimal manner.

<FONT SIZE=6>Computer Programs for Hydroelectric System Operations</FONT>

<DD>Reservoirs are used to capture runoff and to regulate streamflow, based on
knowledge of hydrology and the probability of future runoff. Time scales
for hydrology range from hours to seasons, and sometimes over years.

<DD>The operation of electricity generation and transmission facilities
obviously places demands on the reservoirs. But traditionally, dispatching
and scheduling has been a job for electrical and mechanical engineers who
are trained to understand system stability concerns, requirements to
minimize VARS, and the operating characteristics of the machinery. Time
scales for equipment operations range from seconds to hours and days.

<DD>Older computer programs for hydroelectric operations tend to be organized
in a similar hierarchy. Forecasting and scheduling water has been one
computer program's job; scheduling and dispatching units is another
computer program's job. It is obvious that both jobs should be done
together in an integrated optimization. Many factors are included in
decision support systems - regulatory, economic, hydrological, and
equipment capabilities. Time scales range from current unit settings to
seasonal operating plans for reservoirs. Decision support systems have been
implemented on electrically connected river basins, cascades of dams, and
single power stations.

<DD>Decision support software considers flood operations and power dispatching.
It incorporates hydrologic forecasting, reservoir storage optimization
during floods, and to meet seasonal requirements, tide and backwater
forecasting, and channel routing. Hourly schedules include spillway gate
and generating unit operations.

<FONT SIZE=6>Planning for Upgrades and Capacity Expansion
</FONT>
<DD>Integrating water management with unit operations improves power system
planning. In the past, hydrologists and economists developed reservoir
system models with powerplants, not generating units - as if the plants
operate like a single generating unit. A second step, by engineering
specialists, then considered plans at the level of individual units. Now,
by incorporating individual units into the reservoir system models,
additional flexibility and reality, is gained in planning. Short term
benefits are derived from more realistic rate reviews; long term benefits
are realized in selecting optimal dates for scheduled maintenance, unit
upgrades, and capacity expansion. The resulting improved utilization of
existing facilities reduces the apparent benefit from plant upgrades,
substituting software for hardware.

Real-time satellite downlink systems for basin-wide hydrologic data no
longer are the prerogative of agencies of government. Affordable, easy to
use hardware and software installations are within reach of the smallest
hydro operators. Decision support systems now use these data to provide
power plant operators with timely hydrologic forecasts.

<DD<Decision support software is tailored to the specific needs of the shift
supervisor that uses it. Operating schedules are responsive to changing
circumstances and consistently provide viable water management decisions
that make the best possible use of the generating equipment and the
available water resources.

<DD>There is a close linkage between computer models for operations and for
planning. Decision support systems provide the capability for improved
dialogues between hydroelectric operators, and regulators,
environmentalists, and economists.

<DD>Decision support systems now in use are a revolutionary departure from the
labor intensive mainframe computer models of earlier times. They are point
and click desk top computer techniques that manage and display data,
operating status, and the results of sophisticated, comprehensive analyses.
Decision support systems emphasize ease of use and consistency in power
operations. They make possible the Optimal Integrated Scheduling of
Reservoirs and Generating Units.
