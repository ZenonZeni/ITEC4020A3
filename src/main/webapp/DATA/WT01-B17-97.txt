<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Liver Cancer: How Alternative Medicine 
Helped Me Overcome a Life-Threatening Illness</CENTER></H2>


<BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>A conventional doctor becomes his own patient in an inspiring journey to heal his
liver cancer using alternative medicine. Dr. Needham explains 
his healing program of visualization, magnetic therapy, megavitamins, herbs, and
the belief he could be well again.</I> By Patrick Needham,
M.D.</B></BLOCKQUOTE> 

<HR>
<P>
Though I knew something was not quite right when I consulted a specialist in July of
1994, I was totally unprepared for his working diagnosis, hepatoma liver cancer. This
was my first major illness and at 58 years of age I was determined that with the
Lord's help and guidance I would triumph over this condition. I realized that if I
was going to make good on my resolution, I would have to forge my own way through the
thickets of conventional and alternative treatments. In effect, I had to play both
doctor and patient as I designed my own cancer healing program.

<P>I did precisely that and today would like to pass on some pointers for others making
their own way toward a nonconventional cancer cure using many alternative approaches.
What pulled me through was a combination of visualization, magnetic therapy,
megavitamins, and herbs.
<A NAME="prayer"> </A>
<P>As I left the hospital that day, I started on the first phase of my recovery.
Recalling the verse in <I>Mark</I> 11: 24 (where it says: &quot;whatever you ask in prayer,
believe that you will receive it&quot;), I made this the center of my program. If anything
will test a person's faith, a diagnosis such as this will. A life-threatening illness
such as cancer can cause a person to dramatically alter his life style, thought
processes, and personality.

<HR WIDTH=80%>
<P>As part of this first phase of healing, I would retire to my bedroom each day after
coming home from the hospital where I work as an anesthesiologist. I would lie down
and become as comfortable as possible and then focus my mind on just two things.
First, I visualized that my body was consuming the cancer cells. I would alternate
this with a mental picture of Jesus Christ standing close to me amidst a blue light
that seemed to surround him. I felt that if I could stand in that blue light I would
be healed.

<P>I would lie there for long periods of time, constantly focusing on these two images.
For the first month, this was my only therapy since my regular visits to the
physician consisted only in his monitoring my blood profile and performing other
tests. No treatment of any kind was given to me.

<P>Meanwhile, my physician believed I had a hepatoma, even though a biopsy had not been
performed. The initial lab results showed elevations of my liver enzymes and an
increased alpha fetal protein; in my case, this was 87.7 while normal is 1-3. Each
and every day, whether at work, at the hospital, driving, or during whatever else I
might be doing, I would concentrate on that number coming down when the next test was
run. The number I focused on was 67, 67, 67. Day after day, I focused on the test
result being 67. This began phase one of my healing process.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<BLOCKQUOTE>QUICK DEFINITION: Alpha fetal protein is made in tiny amounts by the liver of the fetus, yet its level
can rise as liver tumors develop; hence doctors routinely test for higher levels of
this protein in suspected liver cancers. High levels can also indicate cirrhosis or
hepatitis.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<P>When I returned for another blood evaluation in 3 weeks, my alpha fetal protein was
now 61-that is, 8 points lower than I had visualized. This was the turning point, for
I was firmly convinced that I had been heard and that my faith in Mark 11:24 was
being answered. The Lord had just &quot;spoken&quot; to me. We were going to triumph. 
<P>
I believe that what occurs in our lives is by design and not by chance or
coincidence. I knew that there were alternative methods for treating cancer, but I
did not know where to find them. While walking through the book section in a store
one day, I saw a book called <I>Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide.</I> To this 
day, I believe that this was not 
a chance encounter, but that I
 was guided in my search for alternative healing methods to find this book.

<P>That night I sat down and devoured <I>The Definitive Guide's</I> chapters on cancer, herbs,
and magnetic field therapy. The book guided me one step at a time through the
treatments that might work for me.

<HR WIDTH=80%>

<P>In the chapter on magnetic healing, I read how William Philpott, M.D., had eliminated
his own heart pain with magnets and had gone on to help 3000 patients with magnetic
field therapy. I purchased Dr. Philpott's <I>Bio-Magnetic Handbook</I> and read it
cover-to-cover the same day. This started phase two of my healing process.

<P>I purchased several 3950-gauss ceramic magnets and started sleeping on them at night.
I placed one on each side of my back at the level of the kidneys, with the magnets'
negative pole facing the body. I placed one magnet over my liver and one over my
spleen. Each night I repeated this, keeping the magnets in place for 6-7 hours. As I
used the magnets, I began to notice positive changes.

<P>My abdomen became less distended and the swelling in my ankles and feet was
remarkably improved. My energy level, which had been almost nil, started increasing.
As my abdominal distention receded, I was able to eat and not feel bloated.
<P>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<BLOCKQUOTE>See <I>Alternative Medicine, The Definitive Guide</I> &quot;Magnetic Field Practitioners, 
Products,&quot; pp. 158-159; &quot;Herbal Medicine,&quot; pp. 144-147.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR WIDTH=80%>
<P>I started taking vitamin C at 6-10 grams daily along with 50,000 units of vitamin A
as well as various herbs and amino acids in large quantities. While using the
magnetic field therapy, vitamins, and herbs, I kept a daily log of what I was doing
regarding dosages and magnetic exposure time. I continued with my appointments with
the specialists and they continued to monitor my blood volumes. I had more
sophisticated tests done in order to pinpoint the liver tumor. These tests, which
included a CAT scan, Ultrasound, and arteriogram, all came back negative, which is to
say, no cancer was indicated by them. Meanwhile my blood profile improved.

<P>Then I began phase three of my recovery. Up to this point, I had not told anyone
outside my family of my condition or the diagnosis. I recalled a passage in <I>James</I> 5,
14: 15 that stated if any are sick among you, have the elder of the church  lay on
hands, anoint with oil, and pray for them. I spoke to Buddy McKinnon, the pastor of
our independent Sabbaterian Church, and asked him if he and the elders would anoint
and pray for my healing. They did this after the services on a Sabbath morning. As
long as I live, I'll remember these individuals-Pastor McKinnon, Jack Matthews, and
James Acosta-as they prayed for my healing. It was a humbling experience.

<P>I felt nothing at that time, but about 2 hours later while at home, I had a sudden
sense of total well-being and complete peace of mind. It is hard to put into words
the intensity of this feeling of serenity. I believe most firmly that the Lord was
reassuring me that we would triumph over the cancer. 

<P>It seemed that every time I turned around, another door was opening for me. This time
I started reading up on herbs in <I>Alternative Medicine: The Definitive Guide</I>. I'm on
many different herbs now, taking about 100 capsules a day. Among this long list, I'm
using: milk thistle, kyolic garlic, dandelion root, <I>gingko biloba,</I> <I>pau d'arco,</I> 
pancreatic enzymes, <I>echinacea,</I> goldenseal root, vitamin E, pycnogenols, coenzyme Q10,
flaxseed oil, L-carnitine, ginseng, chromium picolinate, saw palmetto, beta carotene,
magnesium, ester-C complex, aloe vera juice, glutathione, glutanine, L-cysteine,
phenylalinine, desiccated liver, and alfalfa tablets.  
<A NAME="diet"> </A>
<P>I've changed my diet considerably, too. I don't touch red meats any more and I eat
fish and chicken only occasionally. I eat lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, and
garlic. I figured out the appropriateness of these supplements and dietary changes on
my own from books but without consultation with anybody. I'll probably continue with
these supplements and dietary measures for the rest of my life, but I'll probably
taper down on the dosages.

<P>This illness has been both a physical and spiritual experience for me. I thought I
knew how to pray but when I was given the diagnosis of hepatoma, I realized I really
did not. Today I continue to improve, and the CAT scan, ultrasound, and arteriogram
remain negative. My blood profile continues to improve. I find myself more tolerant
and compassionate to others and their problems.

<P>The role that our emotions have in our health cannot be ignored. I believe that a
positive, optimistic attitude will strengthen the immune system while negative
feelings-anger, animosity towards others, jealousy, and envy-all decrease the immune
system's ability to respond to a disease process.

<P>I hope that this brief summary will help someone else with cancer who may have lost
all hope and given up. Explore the alternatives, ask the Lord's help, and take charge
of your healing.
