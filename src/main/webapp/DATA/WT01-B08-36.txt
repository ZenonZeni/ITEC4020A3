        Rumours had been anticipating what was considered
        incredible but it so happened, and officials in the
        islands, Britain and from </font><a
        href="http://www.ypf.com.ar"><font face="Arial">YPF</font></a><font
        face="Arial"> (the Argentine oil company which is now
        private) were quick in disactivating any wrong
        interpretation of the event.<br>
        &quot;We're a private company and we make our own
        decisions on the basis of efficiency and commercial
        criteria, certainly not politicial. Under no way can this
        be interpreted as a discriminatory action against
        Argentina&quot;, emphasized Nells León YPF's president,
        as well as Roberto Monti who will be succeding him next
        April.<br>
        Anyhow YPF made it quiet clear that if there's a new
        licencing round to the north of the islands, the company
        will bid again and obviously will also partipate when the
        joint bidding of the so called Special Area is convened.
        The special cooperation area is to the west of the
        islands where border lines with Argentina overlap, and is
        the result of last year's September Oil Understanding
        agreed in the United Nations between Prime Minister John
        Major and President Carlos Menem. The area will be
        jointly explored and exploited between both countries.<br>
        Both Governor Ralph and CEO Andrew Gurr pointed out that
        the Argentine-British consortium lost because they didn't
        meet the requirements and concentrated their interest in
        the two most popular tranches, but added that they expect
        an Argentine participation in future rounds.<br>
        A similar message came from the British Ambassador in
        Buenos Aires Peter Hall who said that: &quot;our policy
        and the islands policy is of open doors to Argentine
        companies, but that will depend on the commercial and
        technical level of the bids&quot;.<br>
        The Argentine Foreign Office also received the
        consortium's exclusion calmly, in spite of the setback
        that this could mean for the present approachment policy
        towards the islands and islanders.<br>
        &quot;The British government gave us assurances that
        commercial reasons exclusively were decisive and that no
        political circumstances influenced the non allocation of
        a licence&quot;.<br>
        Nevertheless the Argentine press revealed that in two
        occasions British diplomacy warned the Argentines that
        the YPF/British Gas was not sufficient. There was a first
        attempt to improve it, but on the second time, YPF
        allegedly simply replied, &quot;this is as far as we'll
        go&quot;.<br>
        According to the Argentine press reports,
        &quot;frustration&quot; over YPF/British Gas exclusion
        was shared by both Foreign Offices.</font></p>

        face="Arial"><strong>ECONOMIC BONANZA AND <br>
        DRILLING IN EARLY '98</strong></font><p><font
        face="Arial">The population of the Falklands/Malvinas is
        preparing for what they consider unexpected years of
        economic bonanza following the very successfull first
        ever allocation of off shore hydrocarbons exploration
        licences with the involvement of the some main oil
        companies of the world.<br>
        It is estimated that towards the end of the '97 austral
        summer the first groups of oil industry experts and
        officials will begin arriving in the islands, and
        possibly in early '98, the first exploratory drilling
        could be starting.<br>
        In this first five years exploratory stage, the licenced
        companies have promised to invest several hundred
        millions of dollars which although mostly will be in
        sophisticated equipment and services, and in the high
        seas, there will be ample margin for the business talent
        and capacities of the 2.300 islanders. Several local
        industries such as construction, hotel and lodging, and
        supply services are already anticipating a boom while in
        the camp farmers are offering land on lease next to deep
        shores for the oil companies to set up their operational
        bases.<br>
        Richard Ralph, Governor of the islands said that with the
        successfull allocation of licences a &quot;potentially
        momentous day&quot; and far-reaching time begins for the
        future of the Falklands.<br>
        The CEO of the islands, Andrew Gurr underlined that the
        28th October will become the second most important date
        in the recent history of the Falklands after the
        liberation of the islands by British troops on June 14th.
        1982.<br>
        John Martin, former British Petroleum official and one of
        the main oil experts on contract for the local government
        indicated that &quot;the enthusiastic response to the
        Falklands Islands government offer has been most
        satisfactory, and ensures a vigorous entry of the islands
        into the oil exploration industry&quot;. Phyllis Rendell
        who was making her official international début as
        Director of the Oil Department explained that at this
        stage licence revenue will produce very little since
        companies will be paying an annual fee of 30 US dollars
        per square kilometer.<br>
        &quot;But even if hydrocarbons are found, and in
        interesting volumes, it would take several years before
        commercial production actually gets rolling, we're
        looking at the year 2003&quot;, said Mrs. Rendell.<br>
        The Oil Department Director also remembered that between
        50 to 60 wells were drilled in the North Sea before oil
        was discovered.<br>
        Mrs. Rendell underlined that the islands government will
        be closely monitoring activity in the licenced tranches
        with particular emphasis on the protection of the unique
        natural environment.<br>
        &quot;Some areas of the blocks will have restricted
        access at times in order to preserve and protect the
        marine resources&quot;. </font></p>

        Argentina, and an end to the ban on Argentine passports,
        which the islands' government strongly upholds, concluded
        the VI Argentine-British Conference, (ABC), which took
        place in Salta, in the north of Argentina during the last
        week of October.<br>
        The ABC meeting, a non government organization created
        for the improvement of understanding between both
        countries, had a numerous and distinguished
        participation. The Argentine delegation was headed by
        Senator Eduardo Menem while the British included several
        members of Parliament and influential personalities of
        politics, business and finance, and academics. With the
        British delegation came three islanders which were in
        constant demand and became the central figures of the
        meeting: Lewis Clifton and Terry Betts, both former
        Councillors and now in the fishing and oil business, and
        journalist Graham Bound, founder of the Penguin News and
        actually Director of the BBC &quot;Calling the

        &quot;It's only natural that discussions should turn on

        British-Argentine relations&quot;, said Barney Miller
        member of the committee responsible for the organisation
        of the events.<br>
        &nbsp;Surprisingly, considering his &quot;hard line&quot;
        approach contrary to the present &quot;seduction&quot;
        policy of Foreign Secretary Guido Di Tella, Senator
        Eduardo Menem admitted feeling he has friends in the
        islands and in gentle terms said that &quot;it is most
        important that contacts are made at a cultural, academic
        and even sporting level, because that is the only way
        people can really get to know each other&quot;.</font></p>

        have differences over the location for the new
        headquarters or permanent Secretariat for the Antartic
        Treaty Organisation.<br>
        Member states, which include Argentina, Chile, Uruguay
        and Britain among others have agreed that a central
        Secretariat is necessary if the organisation is to
        continue to be effectively managed as well as to
        coordinate the enriching multilateral scientific
        research.<br>
        Saying that they have the support of the majority of the
        other signatory nations, Argentina has moved quickly to
        claim such honour for Buenos Aires. But Britain does not
        agree with Argentina.<br>
        According to a senior British Foreign Office source, the
        British believe that the Secretariat should not be
        located in any of three nations that have disputed claims
        on the icy continent. These countries with overlapping
        interests are Argentina, Chile and Britain, but all have
        agreed to suspend the claims as long as the treaty
        survives.<br>
        Unofficially the British believe that Argentina wants to
        host the Treaty headquarters because this would add
        prestige to the country's &quot;Antartic condition&quot;.<br>

        the University of London, Victor Bulmer-Thomas who was
        really critical of the islanders and said that &quot;
        British/Argentine relations are being held hostage by
        2.000 islanders&quot;.<br>
        British Labour MP Ton Dalyell anticipated that if his
        party wins the coming elections the next Labour
        government: &quot;will be less tolerant and will bring
        pressure on islanders to commence normal relations with
        Argentina&quot;.<br>
        But the islanders even outnumbered, and moderate compared
        to the hard-liners back in the islands, reminded the
        delegations that Argentines with passports of other
        countries can now visit the islands and visits by
        families of Argentines killed in the war are welcomed.
        Furthermore, islanders are regularly meeting to discuss
        issues of mutual interest such as oil and fisheries with
        their Argentine counterparts.<br>
        Reactions from the islands didn't have to wait.
        Councillors Bill Luxton and Eric Goss said that so long
        as Argentina does not drop its sovereignty claims over
        the islands, &quot;we've nothing to talk about&quot;.
        &quot;These are the only sanctions we can apply on them
        and we know it hurts them&quot;... insisted Luxton.<br>
        The ABC also decided to leave for further discussions a
        private non-official paper by businessman Alastair
        Forsyth which proposes that Britain and Argentina work
        together to establish and mantain an eventual
        independence and special role for the islands in
        Mercosur.<br>
        Some concrete plans which emerged from the conference
        include linking schools in Britain, the islands and
        Patagonia through Internet; seeking funds for joint
        scientific projects and introducing in Argentina a
        British scheme for funding businesses owned and run by
        unemployed and deprived young people which has beeen very
        successfull in Britain. </font><p>&nbsp;</p>

        until a few months ago he held the post of General
        Manager of the Falkland Islands Development Corporation.<br>
        He was decisive in helping to establish the air jet link
        with Chile and presently works as a private consultant.
        He is a supporter of the present Council's policy
        regarding Argentine nationals visiting the islands,
        accepting they come under passports of alternative
        countries. He favours allowing a limited number of
        Argentine journalists to help in communicating the real
        facts about the islands. <br>
        In his political manifesto Summers emphasized in the need
        for government long term planning concerning capital
        investments and targets, so &quot;<em>that the oil
        industry does not end dictating terms to us</em>&quot;.<br>
        Summers also proposed new legislation which makes it
        compulsory for elected members and high officials of
        government to declare their interests, in closed
        envelopes and only for the Governor's eyes, as a way of
        avoiding possible clash of interests.<br>
        Concerning the recent allocation of oil licences and the
        absence of </font><a href="#ypf"><font face="Arial">YPF/British
        Gas</font></a><font face="Arial">, Summers said the
        &quot;<em>concerns of expression are misplaced. I think
        people who are entitled to be concerned about their
        failure to get a licence are their shareholders. If I was
        a shareholder of either of those companies I think I
        would be very cross with the failure to properly approach
        the issue. It serves them right for relying on a nod and
        a wink fro their ministers</em>&quot;.<br>
        Summers also thanked the citizens who participated in the </font><a
        href="#salta"><font face="Arial">Salta conference</font></a><font
        face="Arial"> and expressed he is a supporter of taking
        every possible advantage in strongly explaining the
        islands position to others, &quot;<em>who otherwise will
        make up their own minds</em>&quot;.<br>
        Finally concerning fisheries, Summers underlined the need
        to abide by the international regulations recently agreed
        in the UN for high seas fishing and conservation beyond
        the 200 miles zone. However the new Councillor also
        pointed out that &quot;<em>we must be careful that we
        don't disadvantage those vessels that are flagged in the
        Falklands and stop them from fishing when every other
        vessel in the world are fishing stocks that otherwise
        would have been taken, had they not chosen to transfer to
        our flag and connect their futures to our fishery</em>&quot;.</font></p>
