Bush, Congress Negotiate On Medicaid Funding Rules

With less than two months to go before a Jan. 1 deadline, Congress
and the Bush Administration are trying to hammer out a compromise
on state Medicaid fundraising. In the balance is nearly $5.5 billion in
federal Medicaid matching funds that go to states using taxes on
health care providers or "voluntary" donations by providers to raise
money. In September, HCFA published regulations that would wipe
out most tax and donation programs as of Jan. 1. On Oct. 31, the
agency published a final version of those rules that attempts to
"clarify" the intent of the September proposal. The new plan would
give some states until July 1, 1992, to eliminate tax programs.
Programs begun after Sept. 12, 1991, would not qualify for the
additional time and contribution programs must end by New Year's
day. The new rules are "too little, too late, and leave too many
questions unanswered," says Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX), who is pressing HCFA to withdraw them.
Pressure also is coming from the House, where the Commerce Health
Subcommittee has voted 16-6 to approve a bill (H.R.3595) blocking
the rules until Sept. 30, 1992. To compound matters, HCFA proposed
new regulations, also on Oct. 31, that would limit the number of
hospitals each state can designate as "disproportionate share." Such
facilities receive higher reimbursement, often paid for with tax or
donation funds. While HCFA's hard line stance provoked anger on
Capitol Hill, private negotiations are underway to iron out a
compromise. HCFA wants to cap states' ability to raise funds
through taxes at 20 percent of total state Medicaid funding; the
National Governors' Assn. says the cap should be 60 percent. HCFA
also wants to limit the number of disproportionate share hospitals,
some states have designated all of their facilities in that way --
and to cap the amount that can be paid to such providers. NGA says it
will accept no limits on states' ability to choose hospitals for that
status but members of the Senate Finance Committee are said to be
sympathetic to some limits. In case the negotiations fail, the full
Commerce Committee plans a Nov. 7 vote on the moratorium bill and
Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has introduced a companion bill
(S.1886).

States Liberally Choosing Hospitals That Treat Many Poor Patients

The Bush Administration's charge that states are liberally
designating hospitals as Medicaid "disproportionate share" facilities
is borne out by a recent study by the Prospective Payment
Assessment Commission (ProPAC). "The trend among the state
Medicaid programs has been to provide more disproportionate share
payments to more hospitals," ProPAC says. In New York, for example,
ProPAC found all 260 general hospitals designated as
disproportionate share; in contrast, only one of Utah's 40 hospitals
was so designated. The move to upgrade more hospitals to that
status has accelerated as states have made use of provider taxes to
subsidize Medicaid. In Texas, for example, only a quarter of hospitals
were eligible in 1988; today, all hospitals in the state qualify. And
in Kentucky, the number of hospitals designated has tripled since
1988. In an October report, ProPAC says HHS should develop policies
to ensure that Medicaid money goes to hospitals that need it the
most. A disproportionate share hospital is supposed to have a high
volume of Medicaid and other low-income patients.

Medicare/Medicaid

Florida's Health Care Cost Containment Board wants the state
legislature to ban most referrals by doctors to facilities they own.
The ban on referrals would cover doctor-owned laboratories,
imaging, rehabilitation, and radiation therapy facilities. The broad
proposal, which would include all types of patients, would go well
beyond federal legislation aimed only at Medicare/Medicaid cases.
The board, which has studied the effect of physician ownership on
referrals, also wants to require greater disclosure of doctors'
investments in health care businesses. Thirteen states already limit
physician ownership; New Jersey and Michigan have the most
comprehensive laws. Under Florida's proposal, doctors with a stake
in nursing homes, hospitals, medical supply firms, home health
agencies, and ambulatory surgery centers would have to disclose
their financial interests to patients. "Obviously, we feel that very
stringent measures need to be taken to protect consumers in the
state," says board spokesman David Coley. The Florida Medical Assn.
says the study is flawed and the referral ban would hurt rural
patients.

Arizona, Maryland, and New Jersey Medicaid programs paid hospitals
more than the cost of treating Medicaid patients in 1989, says the
Prospective Payment Assessment Commission. Medicaid almost
covered costs in Indiana, Montana, and North Dakota. But Illinois and
Oregon paid less than half of costs -- 56 percent and 59 percent,
respectively. From 1980 to 1989, states in the East North Central,
West South Central, and Pacific regions of the U.S. cut Medicaid
hospital rates an average of 20 percent. In 1989, the two states
with all payer systems, Maryland and New Jersey, had two of the
highest Medicaid payments with costs at 104 and 102 percent,
respectively.

HHS says it will "aggressively" pursue fraud and abuse in the sale of
durable medical equipment. On Nov. 1 the Department proposed
regulations that would bar Medicare Part B carriers from shopping
neighboring states for the most lucrative Medicare payment, prohibit
unbundling of DME charges, and reduce the number of Medicare
carriers from 33 to 4. The latter is intended to reduce variation in
payment decisions. The government also will ask Congress for
authority to levy fines on miscreant suppliers. Today, HCFA has only
one choice: kick a supplier out of Medicare or allow its misbehavior
to continue. "We prefer to have an array of ways to deal with the
problem between benign neglect and the atom bomb," says HCFA
Administrator Gail Wilensky. Medicare pays about half of the annual
$2 billion DME bill, says the National Assn. of Medical Equipment
Suppliers, which is supporting bills (H.R.2534, S.1736) to set
certification and accreditation standards similar to Medicare's
conditions of participation.

A 6.5 percent reduction in Medicare physician fees is necessary to
"account for changes in consumer and physician behavior" that
otherwise would increase Medicare spending, says HCFA
Administrator Gail Wilensky in a letter to Congress. The 19-page
missive seeks to justify HCFA's plan to reduce fees under Medicare's
new fee schedule to offset behavioral changes. The American Medical
Assn. is pressing Congress to block that move before Jan. 1, claiming
it would cost doctors $7 billion over five years. In a Nov. 1 letter to
Congress, AMA says HCFA is presenting a "distorted view." Opponents
of the preemptive change argue that HCFA can recoup any lost
revenue by limiting future fee increases via the Medicare volume
performance standard. But Wilensky says the VPS is "simply
inadequate" for that purpose. HCFA plans to issue final rules later
this month; so far, Congress still seems unwilling to intervene.
Meanwhile, family physicians are trying to hold off implementation
of a new Medicare coding system for office visits. The new codes
aren't tested and will confuse physicians, says the American
Academy of Family Physicians.

To boost medical services for Medicare patients in rural areas, HCFA
will give $9.8 million to seven states and 51 rural hospitals. Funds
will enable states and health care facilities to form networks
through communication and transport systems to improve access to
primary care and emergency services in rural areas. The states are
California, Colorado, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, South Dakota,
and West Virginia.

The Henry Kaiser Family Foundation is spending $5 million over the
next five years to study Medicaid. The foundation has designated a
15-member panel to study problems with the state-federal program
for the poor under the leadership of New York State Assembly
Majority Leader James Tallon. The panel will examine the
effectiveness and costs of the program and address the role of
federal and state government to recommend a future agenda. Kaiser
also has lined up an impressive staff, headed by Johns Hopkins
University assistant professor Diane Rowland, and including
Georgetown University's Judith Feder, and RAND Corp.'s Steven Long.
Commission members include: Parkland Memorial Hospital CEO Ron
Anderson, MD; former HHS Asst. Secretary for Health Edward Brandt,
MD; California Health Commissioner Molly Coye, MD; and Hopkins
professor Karen Davis.

Health Care Costs

The rate of increase in community hospital expenses dipped to a
five-year low for the first half of 1991, says the American Hospital
Assn. The AHA panel survey of 2,000 hospitals found that a 9.3
percent hike in total expenses, down from nearly 11.3 percent in
1990. Moderate interest rates, a shallow climb in inflation, and
greater use of more part time workers helped hospitals hold the
line, AHA says. The 3.4 percent hike in capital costs was less than
half of last year's 8.9 percent rate and dramatically down from 1982
when it reached 27.4 percent.

Congress should set federal standards for long term care insurance
if states don't strengthen consumer protection laws, says the
General Accounting Office. While some laws are stronger, many
states haven't adopted standards developed by the National Assn. of
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), GAO's Janet Shikles told the House
Commerce Consumer Protection Subcommittee Oct. 24. Prominently
missing are guaranteed policy renewal and prohibitions against
exclusion of Alzheimer's patients. Insurers are doing a better job of
adopting standards, but they need to do better, GAO noted. Shikles
also faulted NAIC, arguing that its model long term care insurance
law should contain uniform definitions, improved methods for
determining eligibility, and greater protection against abusive
marketing practices.

Life and health insurers paid $1.2 billion in AIDS-related claims in
1990, more than four times the level in 1986, reports the Health
Insurance Assn. of America and the American Council on Life
Insurance. The 1990 estimate brings the industry's total in AIDS-
related claims to more than $3.5 billion since 1986. The latest
estimated total for 1990 -- $1.2 billion -- is four times the $292.2
million estimated for 1986. Private health insurers write checks for
about 40 percent of AIDS-related health care costs.

Managed Care

More than a third of psychiatric and substance abuse hospital
admissions are unnecessary, says a new study. Researchers at Blue
Cross & Blue Shield of Michigan are recommending a prospective
payment system for psych/substance abuse hospitalizations, along
with aggressive preadmission review and case management.
Researchers randomly selected 539 cases drawn from 61 hospitals
in southeastern Michigan covering services delivered in 1987 and
1988. Nearly 40 percent of 425 mental illness admissions were
judged unnecessary, while nearly 60 percent of 114 substance abuse
admissions were so viewed. Authors speculate that psychiatrists
are biased toward a "medical model" and insurers provide an
additional financial incentive for hospitalizing patients.

Industry News

The FDA would have additional tools to combat criminal fraud in the
generic drug industry under a bill (H.R.2454) approved by the House
Oct. 31. FDA would be able to debar for at least one year firms and
individuals convicted or implicated in bribery, fraud, false
statements, or other crimes that undermine the FDA approval
process. The bill also would establish penalties of as much as
$250,000 per individual and $1 million per company and permit the
temporary denial of product approvals for up to 18 months. Another
18 months would be tagged on for bribery and fraud. Companies under
suspicion could have their products suspended unless they could
prove their products were untainted. The bill also would revoke
illegally obtained generic drug approvals and provide standby
investigational authority for the HHS Inspector General. A similar
bill (S.1164) by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) is pending.

Medical device manufacturers want to quash an insurance industry
effort to enlarge the government's medical technology assessment
system. Four health insurance groups have offered to chip in $1
million to HHS' Office of Technology Assessment. Currently budgeted
at about $1 million, the office evaluates an average of 20 types of
technology each year. The extra money would double the reviews and
make the government a bigger player in technology dissemination.
But the Health Industry Manufacturers Assn. says the plan would
create a monolithic approach to technology assessment and could
"kill promising technology and deter innovators from going forward
with certain technologies." Insurers say the current technology
assessment process -- which draws on the expertise of some 80
different organizations -- often is conflicting and leaves insurers in
limbo. Insurers are looking for "a solid assessment," says Prudential
Insurance VP Dan Dragalin, MD. The insurers want to start the new
effort in January, but HHS official J. Jarrett Clinton, MD, hasn't
decided whether to accept the offer. Provider groups such as the
American Medical Assn. also are deciding whether to sign on with
the insurers.

The long-awaited veto showdown over abortion counseling at family
planning clinics is imminent. Congressional negotiators agreed to a
one-year prohibition on implementation of regulations that ban
abortion counseling, a move President Bush has promised to veto.
The legislative ban appears in a $207 billion fiscal 1992 funding bill
for HHS and the Departments of Education and Labor (H.R.2707). That
bill includes significant increases in spending on biomedical
research into cancer and Alzheimer's disease. The National
Institutes of Health (NIH) would receive $9 billion in FY92, including
$1.9 billion for the National Cancer Institute and $387 million for
the National Aging Institute, of which $15 million would go toward
Alzheimer's research. To stay under statutory spending limits,
lawmakers agreed to defer spending $575 million of the NIH total
until the last day of the federal fiscal year. Congress took similar
action on several other program areas in the bill, which also could
provoke Bush to wield his veto pen. If Bush does veto the bill, it will
take two thirds of both the House and Senate to override him; to date
Bush never has been overridden. As part of the final bill, conferees
upped funding for HHS' "Healthy Start" initiative to prevent infant
mortality. The bill includes $75 million in FY92, triple the FY91
total but well below the $138.7 million Bush requested. Of that
total, $40 million would immediately go to 15 U.S. cities and
counties; another $25 million would be paid out on the last day of
FY92; and $10 million would go to community health centers (CHCs).
The bill also hikes CHC funding from $478.2 million in FY91 to
$527.2 million in FY92 and raises funding for the maternal and child
health block grant to $650 million, compared with FY91's $587
million. Some cities will also get more money to deal with AIDS.
Other highlights: the Medicare contractor budget went from $1.5
billion in FY91 to $1.7 billion in FY92, but $257 million of that is in
a contingency reserve. Another $150 million is slated for state
survey and certification programs with no requirement for "user
fees."

Hoping to achieve at least partial health care reform, a pair of
powerful congressional Democrats are pressing efforts to reform
the dysfunctional small group health insurance market. House Ways
& Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-IL) and Senate
Finance Committee chief Lloyd Bentsen (D-TX) announced Oct. 24
that they will push for action in 1992. While neither is forsaking
comprehensive reform, both think insurance changes can get White
House backing. "My hope is that this legislation will end a
frustrating impasse," says Rostenkowski. Their bill would set
minimum standards for small firms, ban medical underwriting, and
force renewal of policies. It also would limit how much premiums
could vary and would set parameters on how much insurers could
charge business. Rostenkowski would require insurers to offer
Medicare's benefit package plus new prevention coverage. Bentsen
plans to design his own benefit package. Rostenkowski would have
HHS set and enforce standards, while Bentsen would leave it to state
insurance commissioners. The most expensive element of the plan
would hike the 25 percent tax deduction for the self-insured to 100
percent. That would cost $7.5 billion over five years. Bentsen wants
it done immediately; Rostenkowski would phase it in.

Funding for mental health and substance abuse research would
increase under a bill (H.R.3698) introduced Nov. 1 by Rep. Henry
Waxman (D-CA). The measure also would retain the current structure
of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse & Mental Health Administration
(ADAMHA), despite an Administration proposal to shift research
programs to the National Institutes of Health. Waxman, who chairs
the House Commerce Health Subcommittee, would authorize $525
million for mental health research in fiscal 1992 compared to
$483.8 million spent in FY91. His bill also would authorize $293
million in FY92 for drug abuse research up from $265.2 million in
FY91; and fund alcohol research at $160 million FY92, up from $143
million in FY91. In August, the Senate approved an ADAMHA bill
(S.1306) that would move the ADAMHA research components to NIH.
Waxman's bill would create a new state-run community mental
health services block grant.
