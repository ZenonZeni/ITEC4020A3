<B>Project Title:Battery Thermal Management<p>

Performing Organization: Shape Energy Resources</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Dr. Alexander Rafalovich, (800) 286­4753 </P>

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>The purpose of this project is to establish a field trial of a­Phase Change Material (PCM) based battery thermal management system for electric vehicles. The benefits of this battery thermal management approach have been quantified in a mathematical model, which has been validated
through lab tests conducted by Hawker Energy. In addition, some limited vehicle testing has been accomplished
through Hawker's Oldham France division, as well as through their joint EV development program with Rover.
However, a much more comprehensive field test is required beyond these initial steps, preferably conducted in a
more severe climate. Such data will be collected in this trial to provide the facts necessary to better establish the
precise quantifiable impacts of battery thermal management on overall battery life, reliability, and operating range.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B> </P>

<P>Nine key elements including: 1) PCM selection & testing; 2) encapsulation materials
compatibility testing; 3) encapsulation system design; 4) control system design & test; 5) prototype production; 6)
field test plan; 7) field test vehicle prototype installation; 8) field test; 9) field test results analysis and validation</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>Six key milestones have been established and include the following completion dates:</P>

<P><OL>
<LI>system design 3131196;
<LI>selection of test platform and field trial site visit;
<LI>test vehicle system prototype installation 10/01/96;
<LI>proof of concept field cycle 12/31/96;
<LI>expanded field trial given positive proof of concept 3/15/97;
<LI>final project report 8/15/97</OL></P></P>
