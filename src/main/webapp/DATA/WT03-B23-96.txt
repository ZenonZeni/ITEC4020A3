<B>1.  Introduction</B>
<P>
Both the Labor Party and the Coalition have failed to address
the fundamental issues related to law enforcement and crime prevention.
<P>
The Labor Party policy, contained in the document<I> &quot;Prevention
is Better than Crime&quot;</I>, has adopted the language and arguments
of those critical of traditional law enforcement. The policy 
fails to address crime prevention strategies or foreshadow any
substantive changes to policing.  In the past ten years the Labor
government has increased police budgets, powers and resources
significantly without  evaluating what kind of police service
the community is getting or putting in place any effective accountability
measures. 
<P>
The Coalition's police policy&nbsp;<I>&quot;A Safer Victoria&quot;
</I>offers the community nothing in terms of crime prevention
but instead promises `law and order' through increasing emphasis
on law enforcement and punishment.
<P>
Neither the Labor Party nor the Coalition parties have dealt with
current police priorities.  Presently the police devote significant
resources to detecting victimless crimes, which at worst cause
only minor inconvenience to the community, while ignoring serious
violent crime like domestic violence.
<P>
<I> To win back the streets, governments need to wake &#173; up,
see what is happening and acknowledge that there can never be
a price placed on Law and Order.... Without honest government
commitment, let it be made painstakingly clear that criminals
will continue to gain control of our streets. (Victorian Police
Association President's message, August 1992)</I>
<P>
Both political parties also fail to confront the reality that
whilst the police focus their resources and attention on the streets
the home is the major site for violence and it is estimated that
`white collar' crime accounts for more financial loss to the community
than all other crimes combined.  
<P>
Labor's recent policy statement commits an 8% budget increase
to Australia's most resourced police and an increase in Victoria's
police numbers to 11,000, despite the fact that per head of population
Victoria has one of the largest police forces in any industrialised
country. However even this pledge does not appear to be enough
for the Police Association.
<P>
The Coalition has guaranteed to increase police resources by 10%
and increase police numbers to 11,000 within their first term
of government &#173; if elected.  This  is despite their promise
to cut government spending. Police appear to be a special category
within the Coalition's policy framework for a smaller government.
Their policy indicates that the only services made freely available
to the disadvantaged will be punishments dished out by police,
courts and prisons. 
<P>
Crime prevention can only be achieved when money and policies
are directed to social justice areas such as housing, employment,
health, social services etc.  The Labor Party policy of increasing
the police budget to accommodate Neighbourhood Watch, Police in
Schools and similar types of programs will not prevent crime.
<P>
Increasing the resources devoted to police and prisons diverts
scarce resources from social justice areas without preventing
crime or making the community safer. The diversion of resources
from social justice areas creates greater divisions in society
which in turn is a source of conflict and violence.
<P>
It is staggering that in the Labour Party's policy document subtitled<I>
&quot;Labor's Strategy to Work Co&#173;operatively with the Police
and the Community to Prevent Crime&quot;</I> virtually no reference
is made to issues of police accountability, nor to the effect
upon the criminal justice system, of an increase in police powers
and resources.
<P>
The Coalition parties also lack the sophistication to understand
the clear relationships between policing policies and accountability,
and their consequential impact upon the community's access to
justice. 
<P>
It should be of grave concern to all members of the community
that our political leaders and our political parties have demonstrated
such an appalling lack of interest and concern in the level of
accountability being exercised by, and demanded of, an armed force
now in excess of 10,000 strong in Victoria. This lack of interest
in the accountability to the community of such a large armed force
 represents the greatest single threat to the achievement of a
mature, non&#173;violent, and democratic society in which individuals
can be confident that they will not be subject to arbitrary justice
and violence at the hands of the police.
<P>
This report establishes the need for improved accountability by
the Victoria Police and recommends  imperative strategies covering
all areas of Police operations, to ensure greater accountability
to the Victorian community.
<P>
<B>2. What Is Offensive Behaviour ?</B>
<P>
Mr Koravevic was in a good mood on 22nd October 1991.  So much
so that as he was caught speeding on his motorbike by a speed
camera, he gestured the well known Australian &quot;One Finger
Salute&quot; !
<P>
The police officer operating the speed camera found this behaviour
&quot; personally offensive&quot; and proceeded to charge Mr Kovacevic
with offensive behaviour in a public place. The Magistrate hearing
the case fined the defendant $100 and recorded a conviction.
<P>
According to Mr Ian Freckleton from the Council of Civil Liberties;
<P>
&quot;The time of the police and the courts could be better spent...&quot;

<P>
The use of police resources and taxpayers money to pursue such
a trivial incident is just one example of a gross double standard
existing between the police and the community they serve. The
offensive behaviour of our police is not only an abuse of power
entrusted to our police force, but represents the greatest threat
to the rights of individuals.
<P>
 <B>2.1  Police Violence</B>
<P>
It is the experience of legal centres that violent crimes committed
by police contribute significantly to violence in the community.
It appears that such violence is becoming more frequent and more
serious.  There are a significant number of people in the community
who are deeply traumatised physically and emotionally by such
abuses and who live in fear and dread of the police. Police violence
which goes unpunished can lead to disrespect for the law and a
desire for revenge on the part of those affected.  
<P>
Police violence is usually hidden.  Those who become victims of
police attacks or riots have little chance of bringing those police
officers involved to justice. Usually it is the word of the police
officers involved against one individual.  It is a part of police
culture to stick together and tell lies to protect each other
even under oath at court. People who complain about police treatment
or crimes are often falsely charged and harassed.  
<P>
The current system for making complaints against police is incapable
of dealing effectively with violent police. That this is so indicates
that violence is an accepted part of police culture.
<P>
Research done by legal centres and other groups documents the
prevalent nature of police violence.  Those most frequently affected
are vulnerable people who have little chance of defending themselves.

<P>
 * The National Inquiry into Racist Violence heard evidence that
many of the attacks upon Aborigines, young and old, were perpetrated
by police.  
<P>
 * Research undertaken in Victoria on homeless young people reports
that  forty&#173;seven per cent of females and fifty per cent
of males reported being physically hurt by police.   
<P>
 * A report on young people and the police found that police were
more likely to be heavy&#173;handed in their dealings with young
men, Aboriginal youth and marginal youth.  These groups were more
likely than other youth to be stopped and spoken to by the police,
taken to a police station, and to report being roughed up.
<P>
 * A report by G.L.A.D., Gay men and Lesbians Against Discrimination,
describes as &quot;the most disturbing aspect&quot; of the survey
they undertook, the extent to which gay men and lesbians reported
harassment, discrimination and violence at the hands of the police.

<P>
 * A survey undertaken by the Federation of Community Legal Centres
into police mistreatment included a number of examples of police
assault and sexual abuse of women.  
<P>
The following is a description of what one woman reported happened
to her when she was walking in an area where prostitutes work.

<P>
<I> &quot;A police car pulled up, asked me what I was doing, and
told me to get in the car.  I was taken back to the police station,
through a back door, and told to strip.  I was questioned whilst
I was naked, and police tried to insert an instrument. They then
hit and kicked me&quot;. </I>
<P>
In a separate incident the same woman reported she was standing
on the street when..
<P>
<I> &quot;Police pulled up in a car and said they had a warrant
for me.  They took me to the police station, and to the cells
where they physically abused me, threw buckets of cold water over
me and hit me in the face.  They held a gun to my head and pulled
the trigger, though unknown to me, the gun was not loaded&quot;.</I>
<P>
Another woman reported being threatened with rape at a police
station. 
<P>
Evidence was presented to the Inquiry into Racist Violence undertaken
by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  which indicated
that Aboriginal and Islander women and girls have been sexually
threatened and abused by police officers. 
<P>
 Additional police, given the current levels of police violence,
will not contribute to making the community safer but will maintain
and continue the current police abuse of large numbers of vulnerable
and marginalised people by police.
<P>
<B>2.2 Police Harassment of Gay Men</B>
<P>
Police enthusiasm knows no bounds when it comes to policing the
gay community. The summary offence &quot;offensive behaviour&quot;
is routinely used against gay men frequenting &quot;beats&quot;.
Police helicopters have been used to swoop down on public toilets.
Police chase men in and out of bushes in an attempt to catch `the
buggers in the act' despite the fact that two men engaging in
consensual sex in the privacy of a bush are not committing an
offence at all. Offensive behaviour as defined under section 17
of the Summary Offences Act depends on &quot;where that behaviour
took place, and the circumstances in which it took place&quot;
(Inglis v Fisher 1961).
<P>
 However, the embarrassment of such charges has lead to most men
`caught' pleading guilty. A recent case described in the magazine
<U>Star Observer </U>details the use of plain clothes police officers
and the calling in of `reinforcements' to apprehend two consenting
adults having sex in the bushes late at night. The case went to
court and was deemed by the Magistrate not to constitute offensive
behaviour. 
<P>
According to gay activist Jamie Gardner;
<P>
<I> &quot; what the police refuse to accept is that the decision
to chase gay men around the bushes and prosecute is just that:
a decision. A decision to spend scarce taxpayers' money persecuting
gay men&quot;.</I>
<P>
<B>The Proof Is In The Pudding  &#173; Crime statistics and policing
practices</B>
<P>
The Victorian Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research recently
released its 1991/1992 Crime Statistics. One of the strongest
trends revealed by the Bureau is the concentration of police resources
on victimless crimes. On the other hand the statistics, coupled
with the recent study by Dr Rosemary Wearing of Latrobe University,
reveal that police turn a blind eye to domestic violence. 
<P>
It is appalling that such a significant proportion of police resources
are directed to what basically amounts to the harassment of vulnerable
groups while serious criminal assaults directed at women and children
in the home are ignored. 
<P>
Until policing practices demonstrate a marked change in direction,
increased resources will further the abuse of current powers and
entrench current policing practices. <BR>

<P>
<B>3.1 Self appointed Moral Guardians </B>
<P>
According to the 1991/1992 Victorian Police Statistical Review
of Crime, police filed charges against 741 people for offences
related to prostitution. In comparison 1987/88 figures show 366
people were charged. The increase in prostitution related offences
is an example of an increased vigilance in `moral' policing which
is clearly out of step with community attitudes.
<P>
The charges of soliciting against Bishop Dowling, recently dropped
by the DPP were considered &quot;...trivial and involved no victim
in any accepted sense&quot;, according to Mr Bernard Bongiorno,
QC (<U>Sunday Age</U> 30/8/92).
<P>
The Chairman of the Law Reform Commission Mr David Kelly commented;

<P>
<I> &quot; The sort of thing alleged against Bishop Dowling doesn't
seem the thing that criminal law should be concerned with. There
are many more serious crimes. It's most unfortunate that we should
bother with that&quot;.</I>
<P>
Examples such as these indicate the need to issue police with
stricter guidelines and remove the discretion police use to presume
a role of `moral policing'. Police training should clearly indicate
that homosexual sex taking place in public, though out of sight,
is not considered offensive behaviour at law. Police guidelines
need to be issued which discourages this type of &quot;moral&quot;
policing. 
<P>
The government should indicate to the police in the clearest possible
terms that police budget allocations depend on their efficiency
in dealing with matters of serious concern to the community such
as violence and that scarce resources will not be directed towards
the persecution and prosecution of vulnerable groups.
<P>
<B>3.2   Victimless Crimes</B>
<P>
According to National Drug Offensive Surveys, the use of drugs
in Victoria has remained constant since 1988. However the Bureau
of Crime Statistics and Research shows offences relating to Cannabis
made up 79% of all drug offences &#173; an increase of 31% over
the previous year. 
<P>
Marijuana use is widespread amongst Australians. The targeting
of this drug by police as opposed to harder drugs is a misallocation
of resources.
<P>
Further statistics released by the Bureau in August 1992 undermine
police claims for increased resources and powers. The Major Crime
Index was down by 4.6%, similarly major property crime offences
were down by 4.7%. The overall rate of major crime against the
person has been stable since 1987/1988. 
<P>
Despite statistical evidence that crime has decreased, police
continue to argue the existence of an ever increasing crime problem.

<P>
<B>3.3   No need but fear</B>
<P>
While in the past, increasing crime statistics were used to justify
increased powers, numbers and resources, both political parties
have supported current police claims that an increase in police
presence is needed to alleviate fear over personal safety held
by the public. This is ironic given that the police and the Police
Association significantly contributed to the fear in the first
place to gain what they wanted from government. 
<P>
The relationship between the police and the media is very close
given the reliance by journalists on police as their source of
information. The police media unit selectively releases details
about crimes which support police claims of a `crime problem'.
During June 1992, there was significant print media coverage of
two aggravated burglaries against an elderly couple and an elderly
woman.  The media picking up on police terminology defined elderly
citizens as `soft targets'. 
<P>
Despite a decrease in aggravated burglary, the police set up a
special squad, at substantial cost, to protect `soft targets'&#173;
even though the role of police intervention occurs after a crime
has been committed. The Director of the Victorian Bureau of Crime
Statistics and Research, Dr David Brereton, told a recent conference
on violent crime;
<P>
<I> &quot;...the elderly are a very low risk group, notwithstanding
a few highly publicised crimes...the fear of violence is becoming
a bigger problem than the actual crime itself&quot;</I>
<P>
As the Chief Commissioner Kel Glare stated recently;  
<P>
<I> &quot; the fear is unjustified for the majority of people
in the sense that they won't become victims (and) ....given Victoria's
relatively low aggravated burglary statistics.&quot;</I>
<P>
The Coalition's <I>&quot;Safer Victoria&quot;</I> attributes the
fear factor to Labor's decade in government.<BR>

<P>
<I> &quot;under Labor Victorians are living in fear&quot; (Pg2)</I>
<P>
The claim of a 20% rise in burglaries is nothing short of fear
mongering. What the Coalition omits to say is that burglaries
are down by 6.8% for 1991&#173;92. 
<P>
Regarding living in fear, it is probably of little comfort to
the Coalition that homicide offences have decreased by 20%, in
particular the number of murders have fallen by 28.2%.  While
crime statistics show fraudulent offences are down by 6.3% the
Opposition would have us believe that they have quadrupled. (Pg2)
<BR>

<P>
<B>4. `Women's Place' Within Policing Priorities </B>
<P>
According to Victoria's Kirner government;
<P>
<I> &quot; if violence is to be reduced, action is required to
change community attitudes and behaviour as well as equip the
police to apprehend and convict perpetrators of violence against
women, children and older people&quot;</I>.
<P>
Labor's recently released Law and Order policy makes a commitment
&quot; .... to properly resource the police so that society is
better protected from violent offenders&quot;.
<P>
In the case of domestic violence, police resourcing does not correlate
with protect&#173; ion of women from violent offenders. Police
reluctance to take out Intervention Orders is born out by 1990&#173;1991
court monitoring statistics which show police acted as complainants
in only 3.42% of applications for Intervention Orders.
<P>
According to Labor's policy statement; 
<P>
<I> &quot; Police have always given priority to crimes of violence
involving women and children&quot;. </I>
<P>
This is simply not true! Such a statement is an insult to those
thousands of women who have expressed their deep disappointment
at the lack of police assistance and those women in refuges, women's
and community organisations who have battled for over a decade
to change the police response to domestic violence.<BR>

<P>
The following case examples are daily occurrences for women's
refuges, women's services and community legal centres:
<P>
<B>Case Examples</B>
<P>
Margaret had been seriously assaulted by her partner. Police told
her there was enough evidence to lay assault charges. She thought
they were going to lay charges against him. 
<P>
When she contacted the station a couple of days later, they said
she'd told them not to charge him. This was incorrect.
<P>
The police then told Margaret that it was his word against hers
and if he didn't get convicted 
<P>
they would have to pay costs.
<P>
Shirley was severely beaten by Phillip who pushed her head through
a wall and attempted to strangle her. The police attended and
took both Shirley and Phillip to the station to be interviewed.
They sent Phillip home without charging him and threatened to
charge Shirley with use of a drug of addiction. ( She had not
been using illegal drugs but was on a Methadone program.) They
also subjected her to considerable verbal abuse.
<P>
Shirley had an Intervention Order against Philip. 
<P>
Other police who Shirley had contact with a few days later were
so concerned about her injuries that they had her photographed
by the police photographer and have stated that they are going
to charge Phillip.  
<P>
<I>These examples </I>are not isolated incidents but highlight
widespread police inaction. Unfortunately there are many examples
of police not prioritising and not responding to incidents of
violence against women.
<P>
<B>4.1 Police Culture</B>
<P>
Police attitudes and behaviour when answering calls to domestic
violence endangers women's lives. One third of homicides are `domestic'.
Police behaviour contributes significantly to a situation where
thousands of women and children every year are forced to flee
their homes because of serious criminal abuse at the hands of
their partners or ex partners. Victorian women and children deserve
far more from the police. A government which does not confront
police behaviour in these areas is failing in their commitment
to protect vulnerable women and children from widespread male
violence in the home. <BR>

<P>
<I>`Prevention is better than Crime' </I> states ;
<P>
<I> &quot; Police are trained to view violence in the home as
criminal assault&quot; (P24). </I>
<P>
At present the Family Violence Prevention Unit shares 1.38% of
the total police budget with neighbourhood watch, co&#173;ordination
of community policing squads, child exploitation investigation,
and liaison work with ethnic, aboriginal and gay communities.
What is essential to improving police attitudes is `tied' resources
to the training of police on the issue of domestic violence and
a more appropriate budget allocation to the area of domestic violence.
<BR>

<P>
<B>4.2 Police intervention = savings to society</B>
<P>
Cost effectiveness is increasingly part of evaluating public services
and government departments. The economic costs to society in responding
to domestic violence (ie policing, emergency housing, courts etc.)
are substantial. Intervention which prevents a perpetrator from
committing further offences is not only cost effective from a
policing point of view but also in terms of a cost/benefit gain
for society, particularly women. 
<P>
<I> &quot; Arrest is an important strategy of intervention in
domestic violence. Arrest of the assailant provides the women
with immediate protection from further assault.....(it has) a
deterrent affect in domestic assault and is more powerful than
warning or mediation&quot;</I>.
<P>
A policy statement encouraging police to use their powers in intervening
and taking action in domestic violence situations is more effective
in `preventing' domestic violence than any increase in police
resources. Not only do police fail to initiate Intervention Orders
but they are also reluctant to press charges. Very few breaches
of Intervention Order charges are made by police.
<P>
<B>Case example</B>
<P>
Aida's husband threatened to &quot;blow my brains away&quot;.
When she called the police they said 
<P>
<I> &quot;we prefer to see scars first.......maybe you can sort
things out&quot;</I>
<P>
Not to enforce the law or to treat threat to life lightly makes
the police complicit with the offender, as their  (in)actions
 serve to protect the offender not the victim.
<P>
<B>4.3   Where's the accountability for police discretion? </B>
<P>
The following example is taken from a series of case studies compiled
by one community lawyer at a Melbourne Legal Centre:
<P>
Mr J aged 23 years. Mr J sustained brain damage as a result of
an accident when he was 10 years old. Mr J has been charged with
numerous incidents of false reports to police. One matter is now
part heard awaiting reports from Intellectual Disability Services
and Corrective Services. 
<P>
In addition to these matters, to which Mr J intends to plead guilty,
he has been subject to scrutiny by local police. Charges for failure
to wear a bike helmet and obscene language have also been laid.
<P>
Where is the accountability in police using time and resources
to prosecute Mr J whilst ignoring calls for help as made by Aida?
How can a policy document be taken seriously when there is no
statement addressing the long term problems of police not responding
to domestic violence as a crime?
<P>
<B>4.4  Coalition Policy</B>
<P>
The Coalition's Police policy (released 15/9/92) makes no statement
on the role of police regarding domestic violence. We are told
there will be `support for women to enable them to leave violent
relationships' (P 11). Does the Coalition need to be reminded
that women have nowhere to go as refuges are overflowing with
waiting lists months long ?
<P>
In short, there is no undertaking by the Coalition's policy to
address the problem of police attitudes and inaction regarding
the safety of women in domestic violence situations.<BR>

<P>
The `user pays' principle is central to the Coalitions Federal
Fightback package. It provides a guide to what a Victorian Coalition
government will ascribe to &#173;  the family ideal; the approach
to industrial relations; public service cutbacks. These will in
turn affect the `private' sphere of women's lives. Up front fees
within the `user pays' scheme will impact on quality of life issues
for women in terms of health costs and access to education and
training opportunities. Women's economic status will be negatively
affected by the free market approach of a Coalition government.
 `Smaller government' means &quot; a reduction in the government
services for which women have struggled throughout the century
and which are also an important source of employment for women.&quot;
 Women caught in economically dependent relationships will have
fewer choices when trapped in a violent relationship.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.5   Where Is Prevention Best Placed ?</B>
<P>
What we don't hear the police or political parties talking about
is the marked increase in reporting of sexual assault cases, which
is up by 23.4% Despite this increase, sexual assault is still
one of the most underreported crimes and holds one of the lowest
clearance rates. The funding of sexual assault services has certainly
not kept pace with the increase in reporting &#173; keeping in
mind that  services see many more women who choose not to report
to the police.  If the Labor party is serious about its policy
`Prevention is Better Than Crime', then increased resources should
go to where prevention is being undertaken &#173; within Centres
Against Sexual Assault.
<P>
The programs, education and training being undertaken by these
Centres to change attitudes which condone and perpetuate violence
against women is in the true sense of the word working towards
`prevention' and elimination of this prevalent violent crime.
To fund increases in the police budget whilst sexual assault services
cannot meet demands is a gross misallocation of financial resources.
<P>
<B>5. Who Are The Police Accountable To ?</B>
<P>
<B>5.1  Complaints Against Police</B>
<P>
Despite many public comments by police officers to the effect
that they do not oppose, and in fact would support independent
investigations of police complaints, their treatment of the Police
Complaints Authority established in Victoria during the mid 1980's
makes it clear that they in fact vigorously oppose any independent
investigation of complaints against police.&lt;D%0&gt;
<P>
The community is very cynical about the continued investigation
of Caesar by Caesar. Under the current system the great majority
of the complaints about police are in fact investigated not by
the Internal Investigations Department nor the Deputy Ombudsman
but by police from the same district which the officer complained
about comes from. The experience of legal centres indicates that
often police investigate those for whom they have a direct line
of responsibility, which clearly compromises the independence
of the investigation.
<P>
The failure of the current government and the opposition coalition
parties to address this most fundamental issue of accountability
indicates just how far political parties in Victoria have gone
in compromising the interests of the community in favour of the
interests of this armed force.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.2   Independent Community Visitors Scheme</B>
<P>
Despite the fact that a huge number of complaints about mistreatment
by police relate to events that take place in police stations,
none of the political parties in Victoria have been prepared to
address the need for a preventative independent accountability
mechanism for the operation of police stations.
<P>
The development of an independent community visitors scheme with
powers to randomly visit police stations, to protect the rights
of individuals in custody is urgent. The establishment of independent
community visitors schemes covering all police stations in Victoria
is in the interests of the police, members of the public taken
into police custody, and the Victorian community in general. This
approach of making the police directly accountable to the community
that they are serving, which has already been implemented in England,
is in direct contrast to the current trend towards developing
Police stations that look more like fortresses, and the widespread
attitude of police that they are not to be held accountable for
what happens in police stations.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.3   Strip Searches And Photographs</B>
<P>
In contrast to the move towards controls over police powers regarding
fingerprints and blood samples, which are now under some limited
independent accountability through the Magistrates' Courts, there
has been no legislative protection introduced in relation to strip
searches, internal body searches, frisk&#173;type searches, or
the taking of photographs of individuals being 
<P>
investigated by the police. The failure of the government to address
these fundamental issues of accountability in relation to the
most basic of all human rights, namely the protection and dignity
of our bodies, indicate just how badly out of touch our politicians
are in regard to the routine procedures adopted by police in this
state.
<P>
The Coalition policy states that police will have the right to
&quot;following the consent of a Magistrate conduct a body search.....with
the assistance of a medical practitioner&quot;.
<P>
Whilst we do not believe this goes far enough to protect the community
it is a small step in the right direction. Unfortunately in other
areas the Coalition have removed all requirements for accountability
from the police.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.4  Exercise Of Police Powers</B>
<P>
The extensive powers given to the Victoria Police represent a
substantial privilege that has been bestowed upon them by the
rest of the community.
<P>
There are no systematic accountability procedures in place to
ensure that these privileges are properly exercised and to counter
the institutionalised abuse of powers that has developed within
the Victoria Police. The legislation granting rights to people
in police custody provides no penalties against police officers
who abuse those rights and no other mechanism is available to
effectively complain.<BR>

<P>
There are no penalties imposed on police officers in relation
to the denial of rights given to members of the community. This
basic level of accountability is exactly what police are demanding
for other members of the community who breach the law and fundamental
human rights.
<P>
There is an urgent need for regular independent audits of the
exercise of all Victorian police powers, in particular powers
relating to the following:&#173;<BR>

<P>
<B>(a)  Refusal of Bail </B>
<P>
Far too many people are being placed on bail unnecessarily in
relation to summary offences.<BR>

<P>
<B>(b)  The taking of fingerprints </B>
<P>
There has been an increase in excess of 50% in the number of fingerprints
being taken by Victoria Police since the introduction of the new
legislation in March 1990. The coalition policy to give police
unlimited power to forcefully take fingerprints and name and address
will further reduce police accountability and increase the abuse
of community members at the hands of police, whilst having no
impact on crime prevention and solution.
<P>
The Shadow Minister for Police, Mr McNamara has indicated his
preference for a fingerprinting system where persons charged are
automatically fingerprinted and; &quot;if not convicted the onus
is on the person to request to have the prints destroyed&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
<B>(c)  Search Warrants</B>
<P>
Search warrants are issued far too easily, and in some circumstances
members of the public complain of being presented with unsigned
search warrants or warrants authorising searches of premises other
than the one the police wish to search.<BR>

<P>
<B>(d)  The taking of blood and other body samples </B>
<P>
Although body samples are not often taken, and are subject to
some independent scrutiny of the Magistrates' Court, an audit
and assessment of the use of this power is also necessary in the
interest of an efficient and accountable police force. <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>(e)  Preliminary breath testing</B>
<P>
Although a reasonably well accepted procedure by the community,
a careful audit of this power needs to be undertaken on a regular
basis, particularly in relation to charges of refusal to take
a breath test, where there are allegations of abuse by the police.
<BR>

<P>
<B>(f)  Questioning &amp; Police Custody</B>
<P>
The length of time which people are detained in police custody
for the purposes of questioning should be strictly monitored to
ensure that the most basic of individual rights, i.e. not to be
unnecessarily detained, is protected. Special attention must be
given to situations where people are held in police detention
for questioning and either no charges, or charges for offences
against the police officers, namely hindering, resisting arrest,
and assaulting police are laid.<BR>

<P>
<B>(g)   Legal Representation</B>
<P>
Although provision is made in the <U><I>Crimes Act</I></U> for
an individual's right to contact a legal representative the provision
of legal advice by a solicitor when arrested must be made mandatory,
as is the case in other democratic societies. Currently if police
act in accordance to the law a suspect will be permitted to telephone
a lawyer. Such a right is only of use to those persons who have
twenty&#173;four hour access to a legal representative. There
is an urgent need for a twenty&#173;four hour legal service available
to all persons held in police custody. This mandatory right should
apply irrespective age, race or background.<BR>

<P>
<B>h)  The provision of interpreters</B>
<P>
There is no proper accountability required of police in relation
to the provision of interpreters for people from a non&#173;english
speaking background who do not have a sufficient command of English.
Studies in the area have shown that police are very reluctant
to use interpreters, and the only accountability applied to police
is if the Record of Interview is challenged in a later court proceeding.

<P>
There are no adequate records kept indicating the adequacy of
police use of interpreters, and no clear guidelines requiring
the police to make use of interpreters. <BR>

<P>
<B>(i)  Independent Third persons</B>
<P>
The use of Independent Third Persons in situations where the person
in custody for questioning and investigation is under the age
of 17, or has an intellectual or mental impairment, also requires
proper accountability to be developed to ensure that police comply
with the legal requirements in this area. The situation in relation
to people with intellectual or mental impairments needs to be
given legislative protection, with proper guidelines being developed
for police to guide them in the exercise of this power, and to
monitor the implementation of the power.<BR>

<P>
<B>(j)  Truncheons, handcuffs and water cannons?</B>
<P>
There are no adequate accountability procedures in relation to
the use by the Victoria Police of various items of equipment carried
by them as a matter of course. Police must be held accountable
for the use of handcuffs, truncheons and other items used for
detention or forceful arrest or entry. These items have been provided
to our police force as part of the responsibility and privilege
accorded to police officers because of their unique role in society.

<P>
The failure by the government and opposition parties to address
accountability of the police use of these items has allowed an
attitude to develop in the police force that police will not be
held accountable for the use of these items no matter how inappropriately
they might be used. 
<P>
To be unreasonably or improperly detained in handcuffs or beaten
by police batons is a criminal offence regardless of whether the
person carrying out the action is or is not a police officer.
Police must be  made accountable to ensure that this equipment
is only used when necessary and required by the situation.
<P>
The Liberal National Party Coalition have suggested that water
cannons be available to police to use at demonstrations.  This
is an appalling prospect. Victorian's have the right to demonstrate
in the streets.  Current laws and levels of police resources are
more than adequate to deal with demonstrators should they commit
any unlawful acts.      <BR>

<P>
<B>5.5  Gun Control &amp; Police Firearms </B>
<P>
Labor is to be congratulated on its efforts to control the number
of weapons in the community.  It is also necessary for the government
to ensure that police officers do not endanger themselves or the
community by frequent and unnecessary resort to firearms.
<P>
In the two years between 1987 and 1989 Victoria Police shot and
killed eleven citizens. In ten out of these eleven shootings the
police were not themselves being shot at. In at least seven out
of the eleven shootings the deceased either did not have a gun
or did not have a gun capable of firing.  Four of those shot and
killed were shot in the back, three dying of bullet wounds to
the back of the head.  
<P>
Due to the number of shootings and their controversial circumstances
the Coroner has conducted a lengthy investigation into seven of
them. He is due to make findings about seven of these shootings
in November of this year.  <BR>

<P>
The accidental firing of guns by police or deliberate discharge
of guns in circumstances that endanger the public are events which
occur with alarming regularity.  For example:
<P>
 * When police attempted to arrest a suspect for questioning they
fired seven shots in a public car park on a weekday afternoon.
 The detective in charge of the operation did not check whether
there were any civilians in the car park before attempting the
arrest, although he expected a shoot out. The police shot and
killed the suspect during this incident and the Coroner held an
inquest.  The father of a two year old girl told the Coroner that
his daughter was in a car in the car park when the police opened
fire and he believed that the police tactics had endangered his
daughter's life.
<P>
 * A police officer fired six shots in a busy street at a fleeing
motorist; one shot landed between two teenage girls sitting on
a couch in their home.
<P>
 * In his 1990 annual report, the Ombudsman described an incident
in which a mother and baby narrowly missed being shot when an
officer accidentally fired his revolver during a raid.
<P>
 * A police officer was accidentally shot in the foot by a colleague
at Altona police station.
<P>
 * Officers have been shot and killed or wounded by other police
during raids. 
<P>
 * A man and his two children narrowly escaped serious injury
when a shot accidentally fired from a police officer's gun hit
their car.<BR>

<P>
Only luck has prevented bystanders from being wounded or killed
by police bullets. 
<P>
The Leader of the Opposition Mr Jeff Kennett has argued that armed
guards in Parliament would be offensive and he would ban the carrying
of firearms by security officers inside Parliament and the Treasury
Place offices of the Premier, if he won government.  
<P>
If parliamentarians are to be spared the sight of armed guards
why should other Victorian's be subjected to the sight of the
10,000 odd police officers, many of them still teenagers, who
patrol the streets with guns on their hips?  Most adult Victorian's,
who grew up in the city, never saw a real gun as children. Our
own children see guns every day of the week carried by police.
For many parents trying to raise their children with an attitude
that rejects violence as a means of solving problems these guns
and their prominent display are an affront.
<P>
Any policy which purports to address the issue of public safety
and gun control must address the way that 10,000 armed police
use their firearms. <BR>

<P>
<B>5.6  Specialist  Squads</B>
<P>
There has been increasing concern raised about the operations
of specialist squads such as the Major Crime squad (now disbanded),
the Armed Robbery squad, the Asian squad, and the Special Operations
group.
<P>
None of the major political parties in Victoria have addressed
the need for the review of the existence of these squads and for
the implementation of effective and strict accountability of any
specialist squads that are considered necessary.
<P>
These specialist squads are able to act in a total void of accountability
to the outside community and to the parliament of Victoria. The
nature of complaints about the operations of these squads indicate
that even the most senior levels of police management have very
little control over the operations of these sections of the police
force. 
<P>
It is the clear impression in legal centres based on complaints
made to us that these squads have become a law unto themselves.
 
<P>
Community Legal Centres have seen too many people whose treatment
at the hands of these squads can best be described as torture.
The methods used by these squads are of far greater danger to
the community than most of the people against whom they direct
their ruthless tactics.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.7  Police Training</B>
<P>
None of the major political parties in Victoria have adequately
addressed the issue of police training.
<P>
No reference is made to training and recruitment policy in the
Coalition's policy document. Instead it is intended that off duty
and retired police will be able to pick up extra cash doing unidentified
jobs.
<P>
The Victorian Labor Party Policy Statement proudly announces that
;
<P>
<I> &quot;Recruits now go through a 19 week training course before
beginning formal on the job training which continues for two years.&quot;</I>
<P>
 This in fact reflects the status quo as it has been for many
years, and is patently inadequate.
<P>
Whilst police in Victoria have made substantial gains in pay and
other benefits over the last decade very little work has been
done to ensure that they receive adequate training in relation
to dealing with young people, dealing with people from diverse
ethnic and cultural backgrounds, and the development of more sophisticated
and less confrontational tactics when dealing with the public.
<P>
The 19 week training course currently provided to Victorian police
officers is grossly inadequate and despite significant increases
in budgetary allocations over the past 10 years, the Victoria
Police have not chosen to give high priority to training.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.8  Access To Justice</B>
<P>
None of the major political parties in Victoria have addressed
the effect of increased police powers and resources on access
to justice and the criminal justice system as a whole.
<P>
The Legal Aid Commission has had to refuse almost 30% of legal
aid applications for the period ending 30th June 1992 compared
to 20% for the period ending 30th June 1991. Whilst 85% of legal
aid recipients are living below the poverty line, many people
unable to afford legal costs are not receiving any legal assistance
due to more stringent legal aid guidelines. 
<P>
The Legal Aid Commission has had to increasingly reject applications
due to significant budgetary constraints. Under the Commonwealth
&#173; State Legal Aid funding agreement the state is required
to provide 45% of the Commission's income. Interest from the Solicitors
Guarantee Fund has largely met the State's financial obligation
in the past. With the Solicitors Guarantee Fund and interest rates
at an all time low, the state government has had to dip into its
purse to provide legal aid funds. However, Government funding
has not kept pace with the increasing cost of cases due their
increased complexity and length.
<P>
People facing criminal charges in Victoria are now regularly being
refused legal aid even when they have a very sound defence to
the charge against them, on the grounds that they are unlikely
to go to gaol or receive substantial fines. These people are not
in a position to be able to afford the cost of legal representation
out of their own pocket, and are pleading guilty and being convicted
simply because they have no means by which to present their case
to the courts.
<P>
The number of people appearing before Magistrates' Courts without
the benefit of legal representation is rising dramatically probably
for the first time since the development of community legal centres
in the early 1970's and the creation of legal aid commissions
in the early 80's.
<P>
The failure of any of the political parties to address the direct
correlation between the impact on the demand for legal aid and
increased police resources and powers is a clear indication that
those parties no longer have any genuine commitment to justice
in our community and have become slaves to the political pressure
being applied by the Victoria Police.
<P>
Legal Aid impact statements must be prepared detailing the effect
on legal aid services, the court system and the corrections system
of any increase in police powers and resources, and appropriate
funding must be made available to ensure that the other parts
of our criminal justice system are able to adequately deal with
the flow&#173;on effect of these changes.<BR>

<P>
<B>5.9  On The Spot Fines </B>
<P>
Labor states that they will introduce on the spot fines for a
wider range of offences. It is said that this will relieve the
work load of the police and the court system. In the 1990&#173;91
financial year the Victoria Police collected $35 million in on
the spot fines. 
<P>
Many Victorian's are faced with heavy fines of this nature at
a time when they are suffering great economic hardship. The fines
have vastly different impacts on different people because they
take no account of a persons income or ability to pay. 
<P>
Another offensive aspect of these fines is that ordinary people
have no hope of challenging them once they have been issued. Many
people complain that some police officers incorrectly or unfairly
issue such fines. 
<P>
It is not possible to get legal aid to challenge the fines and
most people are not confident enough to put their story at court
without legal representation and with the risk of receiving an
even higher fine. It is true that on the spot fines save police
and court time but at the high cost to freedom of making police
officers judge and jury, and ultimately at the cost to individual's
freedom.<BR>

<P>
<B>6.  Recommendations</B>
<P>
<B>6.1  Development Of Local Police Accountability</B>
<P>
The Victoria Police has progressively become more isolated and
alienated from its local communities. Attempts at community police
liaison and developments such as police community consultative
committees (P.C.C.C.) have generally not been successful because
local communities have viewed these developments as police controlled
public relations exercises rather than genuine attempts to develop
accountability to local communities. These local committees have
never possessed any real decision making powers, and on occasions
have been subject to directions higher in the police force quashing
local community initiatives aimed at developing local accountability.
<P>
There can be no substitute for the development of real accountability
of police to their local communities. What is needed is local
management committees with real powers to direct the use of police
resources available to their community, including the prioritising
of police work in the prevention and detection of crime within
that community.
<P>
Clearly appropriate guidelines need to be established for the
operation of community management structures for police. Much
work needs to be done to ensure that these management committees
are appropriately resourced. These committees should be provided
with guidelines, developed in consultation with the community,
that balance the need to protect individuals rights from unnecessary
interference and arrest, against the need of the community to
implement effective crime prevention and an adequate response
when crime does occur.<BR>

<P>
It is shameful that none of the major political parties in Victoria
have addressed the widening gap between police and the local communities.
The future safety of our community requires a move away from police
officers barricaded from the community by roller doors, high security
fences, and motor vehicle windows two thirds closed. These images
tell the community that  the police do no trust the community
and therefore are not to be trusted themselves.
<P>
The development of local community management structures must
not be left in the hands of the police force, but rather with
the appropriate input from bodies such as the Law Reform Commission,
Ethnic Communities, Womens Groups, Youth Organisations and local
 government to name a few of the obvious participants.
<P>
While the Coalition Parties and the current government are rushing
to give Victorians more police, with more powers and more community
alienating equipment, little recognition has been given to the
increasing alienation and distrust of police because of their
lack of accountability. Real accountability does not come from
words in political policy documents but from appropriately developed
community structures.
<P>
What is required in Victoria is a radical rethink of the direction
in which our police force is going and the way in which our police
are held accountable to local communities.<BR>

<P>
<B>6.2   Accountability Of Senior Police Management</B>
<P>
The lack of accountability and the increasing politicisation of
the Victoria police in recent years has alerted many Victorians
to the need for an independent management committee to overview
Police.
<P>
This committee would need to be directly accountable to the Minister
and Parliament for all aspects of the operation of the Police.
The composition of this committee needs to be developed in careful
consultation with all political parties with advise from appropriate
government departments, community organisations, and management
consultants. The make up of such an independent management committee
should be at least 70% non police personnel.
<P>
The Labor Party policy applauds the value of independence of the
Victoria Police from the executive arm of government. Their policy
document points to the experience of the police force in Queensland
as revealed by the Fitzgerald Inquiry, and rejects the Kennett
Opposition's proposal for a Police Board on the grounds that it
will reduce the independence of the Chief Commissioner and be
a source of political interference.
<P>
These statements ignore the development of a politicised police
force in Victoria over the last decade. These comments and a reference
to the need for internal investigations to be monitored by the
Deputy Ombudsman, are about the only comments the Labor Government
Policy has to make in relation to police accountability.
<P>
The Opposition parties, whilst proposing a Police Board have given
very little substance on which to evaluate their proposal, and
like the Labor government have totally ignored the wide range
of other issues associated with the appalling lack of police accountability
in Victoria.<BR>

<P>
<B>7. Conclusion</B>
<P>
Both political parties offer no commitment to directing policing
practices and priorities towards a crime prevention framework
with appropriate accountability mechanisms. Policy statements
are meaningless without an honest appraisal of what needs to be
improved. Both Labor and the Coalition have opted for election
manifestos which avoid tackling the real issues in achieving crime
prevention and law enforcement.
<P>
Whilst Labor does acknowledge a `social context' to crime, the
Coalition does not even attempt to state why crime occurs. The
approach of the Opposition to the role of police amounts to little
more than an elementary lesson on respecting the law. The noticeably
`thin'<I> Safer Victoria </I>espouses a traditional approach to
policing and a paternalistic attitude of encouraging `trust' in
our force. This sets the  tone for a document which at best is
naive and at worst dangerous.
<P>
With the current lack of police accountability the impact of budget
increases of 8% under Labor and 10% under the Coalition in terms
of increased numbers, powers and resources will ensure that more
and more people will experience the kind of abuse at the hands
of the police that we have come to associate with military regimes
or police states.
<P>
Community legal centres are already seeing people whose basic
faith, that we may live in a society where these type of abuses
are not allowed to occur, has been shattered. That knowledge of
these abuses is not more widespread is due in part to the wilful
ignorance of politicians who refuse to heed the warning signs
and a media that to a large extent is successfully managed by
the million dollar police media liaison bureau. 
<P>
The failure of the major political parties in Victoria to address
the important issue of accountability of a major government department
with an annual budget  in excess of $600 million and which represents
an armed force of over 10,000 individuals raises serious questions
about the relationship between politicians and police in the state
of Victoria. 
<P>
That it is left to the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic.)
to raise these fundamental issues of accountability is a shameful
indictment of the political parties and politicians in the state
of Victoria.
