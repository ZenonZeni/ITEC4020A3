Electronics firms to jointly study chip-making equipment+

TOKYO, Dec. 29 Kyodo

     Japan's 10 major electronics makers will launch a joint study
on equipment to produce semiconductors for 12-inch wafers, a
business daily reported Friday.
     The 10 manufacturers, including NEC Corp., Toshiba Corp. and
Hitachi Ltd., will establish a company for the study with joint
investment of 30 billion yen by the end of March, the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun said.
     It will be the first time in about 20 years that such companies
cooperate with each other in a study of this kind, the paper said.
     The new company will test semiconductor-manufacturing equipment
made by each manufacturer and examine the most suitable manufacturing
conditions for equipment to produce 12-inch wafers on a large scale,
the paper said.
     The new company will start operations at the end of 1996 and
complete the joint study in four years, it said.
     The 10 companies will produce such wafers individually following
the results of the study, it said.
     Semiconductor makers have so far been studying such equipment
individually, but they decided to cooperate with each other to cut
down on study expenses, the paper said.
     Twelve-inch diameter wafers are expected to replace 8-inch ones,
currently standard in the microchip market, in the near future.
