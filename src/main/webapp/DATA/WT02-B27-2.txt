<HR>

At about 8 o'clock on a Thursday night John Polanyi walked into the
janitorial closet he called a laboratory. It was 1956. The young U. of
Toronto lecturer couldn't expect much more. He wasn't even an
assistant professor yet. Polanyi's first graduate student, Ken
Cashion, wearing his regulation short-sleeved Hawaiian shirt said,
"Well, I think we're ready for another run."<P>
 
"Did you check the seals on the 'Stokes'?" said Polanyi, glancing at the giant
vacuum pump thwapping away in the corner.<P>

"Yes. They're not great, but I think she'll hold for one more
experiment," said Cashion. <P>

The 'fresh-air' scent of ozone caught Polanyi's nose as Cashion opened
the hydrogen valve and flicked a switch. For this experiment they
needed to break hydrogen gas (which occurs naturally in pairs of
hydrogen molecules) into single atoms. Ken had scrounged the
electrical discharge unit from a neon sign. By jolting the flow of
hydrogen with 6000 Volts of electricity, they could break the gas into
singlet hydrogen. Polanyi always liked the soft pinky neon glow it
made but he worried about hydrogen's explosive power. Some hasty
calculations the day before had shown the lab would not blow up, but
they weren't entirely sure.<P>

As it turned out, the experiment was a success and
they recorded a spectrum that  no one had ever seen
before. Because Polanyi understood the source of the feeble light
emissions in his experiment, he was able to predict exactly what
kind of energy needed to be applied to make this chemical reaction
take place. His work helped to answer the question: How do you get
a chemical reaction to go? Do you tickle the molecules or do you
slam them together? It turns out that in some cases tickling works,
in others you just have to slam them against each other. As Polanyi
says, "The importance of this work was that we had a picture of
reacting atoms in the transition state."
This understanding eventually resulted in Polanyi's Nobel prize.<P>

<B>History:</B> <BR>
When Polanyi was 11 years old his father who was a
university professor at U. of Manchester in England, sent him to
Canada so that he would not be hurt during World War II. John stayed
with a U. of T. family in Toronto for 3 years. He remembers going
on a bicycle camping trip and reading the "Count of Monte Cristo". He
was not interested in science much, though his dad was a chemistry
professor. He was more interested in sociology and literature.<P>

<H3>1. The Nobel prize winning experiment</H3>
 When Polanyi arrived at the University of Toronto in 
1956 he decided to study this reaction. A lot of energy
is given off when hydrogen and chlorine react to form 
hydrogen chloride, but nobody knew much about the energy.
Little did Polanyi realize that this little reaction
would lead to a Nobel prize 30 years later.
<P>
<H3>2. Transition state</H3>
 For a brief instant at the moment of reaction, the
molecules are in a transition state as they turn into new
chemicals. Polanyi's experiments led to a picture of the arrangement
of atoms in the transition state. Knowing this, he could predict what 
kind of vibrational and rotational energies would result in a chemical
reaction.
<P>
<H3>3. <A HREF="http://www.chem.vt.edu/chem-ed/spectroscopy/chemiluminescence.html">Chemiluminescence</A></H3>
 Polanyi used an infra-red spectrometer to measure the
light energy emitted by the new-born reaction products.
The product molecules "chemiluminesce".
From this very feeble emission of light, Polanyi was able to distinguish 
between vibrational and rotational energies in the molecule.
Because he understood the source of this light he was able to propose 
vibrational and chemical lasers, the most powerful sources of infrared
radiation ever developed.
<P>
<H3>4. The "Lab"</H3>
 Polanyi's graduate student assistant Ken Cashion set up 
the Nobel Prize winning apparatus and was the first to see
the result of the experiment. The two researchers had to "borrow"
the spectrometer from others. If anyone had realized how they had
dismantled it and modified it for their experiment, 
they would have been furious.
