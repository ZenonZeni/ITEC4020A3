<B>ETHANOL EXECUTIVE OUTLINES CHALLENGES OF INCREASING USE OF 
DOMESTIC OXYGENATES</B><BR><BR>
</center>
</center>
Houston, TX -- In a presentation before the 1996 DeWitt Global Conference on MTBE, Oxygenates, and Methanol, Eric Vaughn, President of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), outlined the challenges facing the domestic oxygenate industry and his vision for increasing production and use of domestic oxygenates.  <BR><BR>

"The oxygenate industry must begin by more effectively promoting the air quality benefits of oxygenates," said Vaughn.  Referencing data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Aerometric Information Retrieval System and the EPA National Dry Deposition Network, Vaughn noted that areas using RFG experienced an 11 percent reduction in ozone exceedances between 1994 and 1995, while areas using conventional gasoline witnessed a 79 percent increase.  "The benefits realized from RFG to date are uniquely and predominately the result of the oxygen requirement," said Vaughn.<BR><BR>

Vaughn discussed the need to develop a better understanding of the technical effects of oxygenate use, referring to the recent controversy surrounding the efficacy of the oxyfuel program.  Vaughn added that the RFA and the Oxygenated Fuels Association are working together on a test program to evaluate the ambient air data for carbon monoxide in areas using oxyfuels.  "This data should go a long way to resolving any legitimate doubt that the oxyfuel program is providing significant reductions in carbon monoxide levels and exceedances across the country," said Vaughn. <BR><BR>

Rising imports of MTBE were also discussed as a threat to the oxygenate program.  "We need to recognize that the political support for oxygenates is based, in large part, on the economic and employment benefits attributable to domestic energy production," said Vaughn.  Imports of MTBE reached record levels in 1995, continuing a trend that has seen MTBE imports grow more than 400% in five years.  Even more troubling, said Vaughn, is that 1995 MTBE imports were mainly from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC countries.  "The trend is clearly toward greater MTBE imports, and a greater dependence on OPEC," said Vaughn.  "I would submit to you that if this trend continues, it will threaten the continued political support for the oxygenate program itself," cautioned Vaughn.  "There is no constituency for imported oxygenates."  <BR><BR>

Rather than increasing our current dependence on Mideast energy sources, Vaughn recommended promoting the increased production of domestic oxygenates, both MTBE and ethanol.  "It only makes sense that as we address one critical public policy objective -- air pollution, we not exacerbate another -- energy security," said Vaughn.  "We should never disagree that U.S. energy policy should be grounded in the promotion of domestically produced energy resources; that the role for oxygenates in the nation's fuel supply is critical to continued improvements in air quality and must be expanded; and that both oxygenates should be allowed to grow and develop in this important market to their full potential."
