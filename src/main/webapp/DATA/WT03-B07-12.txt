OPEC Countries & Their E&P Partners Have Bright Prospects

Contrary to expectations made in the past year, the situation in
most OPEC countries has improved and their prospects in 1996 are
bright. The prospects for foreign oil companies investing in these
countries are bright as well. To the surprise of pessimists, the
situation in Saudi Arabia will be among the most stable. The
following is a review of prospects in each of the OPEC countries,
based on information obtained by highly placed APS sources:

ALGERIA

The state concern Sonatrach has signed a deal securing the largest
investment by a foreign oil company in Algeria since it won its
independence from France in 1962. Several such agreements are under
negotiation with some of the world's largest oil companies.

The deal, signed on Dec. 23, 1995 in Algiers, commits British
Petroleum to invest in a $3.5 billion programme to develop and
market huge gas reserves in the In Salah region. Exxon is among
majors negotiating a similar deal (see Gas Market Trends).

Sonatrach is producing 780,000 b/d of oil, and its quota from OPEC
is 750,000 b/d. Atlantic Richfield is investing about $1.3 billion
to expand production in south-eastern Algeria. A number of major oil
discoveries were announced by Sonatrach recently after four years of
exploration by Anadarko of the US, Agip of Italy, Repsol and Cepsa
of Spain and BHP of Australia.

The business community in Algeria and foreign investors are putting
their faith in Liamine Zeroual, the former army general who was
elected president on Nov. 16. He won a five-year term with 61% of
the vote as well as a legitimacy he lacked in his previous term,
which he had secured with military help. His Islamic opponents have
lost support, weakened by a government crackdown and by internal
disputes (see News Service of this week's APS Diplomat). Donor
states are giving Algiers new credits and the government is to
accelerate the pace of economic reforms inspired by the IMF.

Foreign oil companies operating in Algeria are satisfied with the
security measures and special flight facilities to and from the
hydrocarbon-rich south. Since mid-1995, the government has
established four exclusion zones in the south with the army
providing protection against sabotage. There are about 5,000
expatriates working in the south, mainly in the hydrocarbon sector.
Their number will increase with the advent of BP, Exxon and other
foreign operators.

GABON

Producing 370,000 b/d, against a quota of 287,000 b/d from OPEC,
Gabon still has good prospects for E&P investors and its capacity in
1996 would reach 400,000 b/d.

At OPEC's ministerial meeting on Nov. 21-22, which rolled the 24/52m
b/d production ceiling over to end-June 1996, Gabon reiterated that
it would leave unless its annual contribution to the organisation's
budget has been reduced in line with the size of its quota. This
matter was shelved until the next OPEC conference on June 5.

INDONESIA

Political stability and rapid economic growth in Indonesia are
inter-dependent and the prospects for 1996 are good. There is a
great deal of new foreign investment pouring into the country. The
list of investors for 1996 is long. For new private oil refining
projects, as one example, there were 33 different investment
proposals made in the past two years and the Board of Investment
only approved eight of them.

These include a $1.1 billion, 150,000 b/d export refinery to be
built by the private Saudi firm, Nimir Petroleum, in partnership
with Mitsui & Co. of Japan and PT Gigaraya International, a private
Indonesian company. The JV would be using Saudi crude oils. A larger
refining venture, for export, is being proposed by Indonesian
investors including a son of President Suharto, to be using Middle
East crudes.

Despite the country's gradual shift to natural gas, oil consumption
in Indonesia is exceeding 700,000 b/d and will reach 1 million b/d
by 2000. The country may become a net oil importer by 2005 or
shortly thereafter, if no major oil discoveries are made in the
meantime.

At present, Indonesia's oil production excluding condensates and
NGLs is averaging 1.33 million b/d, in line with its quota from
OPEC. The biggest investment in natural gas this century is to be
made by Exxon at Natuna, where it holds a major stake, with
Pertamina having agreed in principle to grant a 13% stake in this to
Mobil.

IRAN

Against an OPEC quota of 3.6 million b/d, Iran during the past
several weeks has been able to produce more than 3.75 million b/d.
Production from some onshore fields has improved, due to extensive
field work done by NIOC since early 1995, and offshore output has
risen as well.

The political situation in Iran will depend on the outcome of
general elections in April/May 1996. The current parliament, elected
in April/May 1992, is dominated by traditionalist hardliners who
have proved to be more negative towards the West than the ultra-
populists on the left who lost in the 1992 elections. In the
previous parliament, when the latter had a strong presence,
President Rafsanjani's pragmatic faction used to benefit
considerably from his balancing acts between the traditionalists and
the ultra-populists. Rafsanjani lost that balance in 1992 and has
since become weaker, with the traditionalists' behaviour doing their
country's economy more harm than its real enemies.

The confrontation with the US in late 1995 culminated in a new
measure by congress to punish those non-US companies which continue
to assist in Iran's hydrocarbon sector. In June 1995, Washington
imposed sanctions against Iran and in March had forced Conoco to
cancel a $900m deal to develop two of the Sirri offshore fields -
with Total of France having since signed a $600m agreement to
develop them. Although Tehran now says the US measures would not
harm Iran, in reality the country has begun to suffer more seriously
and its financial difficulties are getting worse. While France would
back Total and the Sirri development might go ahead as planned, no
other major project in this country would be financed by OECD states
or companies in the near future; none of the major banks will
finance any of the oil or gas pipelines proposed to pass through
Iran from Central Asia.

In November 1995 the oil ministry and NIOC held a four-day seminar
in Tehran and attracted about 40 foreign companies. The latter were
presented with 11 new oil and gas development projects worth over $6
billion, all requiring foreign investment on "buy-back" basis.

The foreign participants were told they would provide finance and
would be repaid in crude oil, gas or products from the completed
project. The profit margin offered was a bit better than the one
which the Japanese rejected in 1991, when a small offshore oilfield
at the Strait of Hormuz was to be developed and Japex was to act as
a competitive banker. NIOC asked the participants to come up with
bids by Jan. 1.

All those who are still interested in Iran are awaiting the outcome
of the April/May elections. By then they will have seen how the US
applied the tougher sanctions and how President Rafsanjani managed
to free himself from barriers imposed by the traditionalists. If the
traditionalists win again, the situation in Iran could worsen
further (see News Service).

One of the problems is that Iran is moving steadily to a point when
its oil consumption will exceed its exports. According to its
central bank governor Mohsen Nurbakhsh on Dec. 27, Iran's oil
consumption from March has risen to 1.4 million b/d - compared to
1.1 million b/d in the previous fiscal year to March 1995. This has
raised the "oil burden" on the state to almost $10 per annum. In its
new budget to March 1997, the government has forecast oil export
revenue at $15.9 billion, up 18% over March 1995-96 earnings.

The budget is based on an average price of $15.50/barrel for Iranian
crude oils, compared with $15/barrel for fiscal 1995-96. This seems
to be a bit optimistic, as the prospects for crude oil prices in
1996 are not very promising.

From March to end-1995, the actual price of Iranian crude oils
averaged slightly higher than $15/barrel. But in 1996 oil prices may
fall below that average.

Key factors of uncertainty for crude oil prices in 1996 include: (1)
Iraqi oil, with Baghdad under heavy pressure to allow partial sales
under a UN plan; (2) an increase in non-OPEC supplies, which is
almost certain if no major accident occurs (see study to be
serialised as from next week's Review); and (3) deflation in OECD
countries, if it continues.

IRAQ

There is no way that the UN sanctions against Iraq will be lifted in
1996 while Saddam Hussein is in power. The situation worsened after
Jordan's Dec. 26 announcement that it seized several kilos of three
"extremely dangerous" chemical components bound for Iraq, one month
after Jordan's seizure of a machine tool capable of fabricating
missiles and other weapons. As soon as the Iraqis learned of the
negative consequences, their dinar collapsed. At the same time,
pressures on Baghdad mounted from all directions; and France is
pressing hard for the Iraqi government to accept the UN plan for
partial oil sales which, among other things, should help finance UN
operations, as well as bring in food and medicines to the Iraqi
people.

Last week there were signs that Baghdad might soften its tone on
this. If Baghdad allows partial oil sales, to involve about 300,000-
400,000 b/d in 1996, prices would fall. This is because most OPEC
members are exceeding their quotas, with non-OPEC exporters
increasing their supplies in 1996 to take much of the 1.1 million
b/d boost in world oil demand. The prospects for Iraq might brighten
suddenly in 1997, after the US presidential election of November
1996, if Baghdad and Washington strike a deal related to the Middle
East peace process and other matters.

KUWAIT

Exceeding its 2 million b/d quota by a mere 45,000 b/d, Kuwait is no
longer happy with formula pricing based on sweet Brent and WTI
crudes. KPC wants to see a sour crude marker develop to replace
Dubai and become the benchmark for the pricing of its crudes as well
as those of Saudi Arabia and other Middle East exporters. At a
London conference last November, KPC marketing official Abdel Samad
Al Awadi suggested that Gulf producers sell part of their exports on
the spot market to create their own sour marker. But this depends on
acceptance by Saudi Aramco, whose pricing formula influences world
oil prices (see Downstream Trends).

Kuwait's political stability has improved in recent months and
further improvements are anticipated in 1996. Its oil production
capacity is being expanded according to plan, with downstream
operations overseas to be expanded further in 1996.

LIBYA

Exceeding its 1.39m b/d quota by about 30,000 b/d, Libya has a
number of internal problems caused primarily by UN sanctions imposed
since April 1992. An Islamic movement, spearheaded by militants
trained in Afghanistan to fight Soviet occupation, has declared a
holy war (Jihad) against Qadhafi's regime. One of its leaders,
Shaikh Abu Munther Al Saidi, has said the bloody events in June,
August and October 1995 were only "the beginning of the Jihad".

However, European oil companies have not stopped operating in Libya.
In fact several of them have increased their investment in the past
year.

NIGERIA

The political situation in Nigeria is very bad, because its military
dictator Abacha is holding on to power and is isolated
internationally. A US-EU oil embargo against Nigeria is unlikely,
however, and Shell has decided to go ahead with a very expensive LNG
project in the country.

Nigeria is exceeding its 1.865m b/d OPEC quota by about 100,000 b/d.
Like most other OPEC members, it will continue to produce at
capacity, which in 1996 will exceed 2m b/d.

QATAR

On June 27, 1995, Crown Prince Shaikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani
peacefully toppled his father - then on a tour abroad - and became
emir of Qatar. In the following months Hamad and his chief aides
began to upset Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in many ways and some of
them were too arrogant for the Egyptians, the Syrians and others.
They were too cordial to Israel and the US to bother with the
Saudis. But at the GCC summit on Dec. 4-5, Hamad walked out when the
Saudis got the council to choose their candidate, Jamil Hujailan, as
GCC secretary general. Later Doha threatened to leave the GCC if its
candidate and other demands were ignored.

Suddenly, however, Shaikh Khalifa appeared in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 24
and vowed he will return to Doha to regain power. Overtly, Hamad and
his aides ignored the warning and Khalifa's subsequent GCC tour; but
covertly they panicked and were no longer arrogant to the Egyptians
or Syrians.

Qatar is exceeding its 378,000 b/d quota by more than 85,000 b/d.
Its oil production capacity has risen to 465,000 b/d, due to a boost
in the output of Occidental Petroleum from less than 20,000 to
63,000 b/d. Further increases are evisaged by Oxy and Maersk this
year. Capacity will exceed 500,000 b/d by 1997. In November a spot
market in Al Shaheen sour crude, 30.3x API with 1.9% sulphur, was
created. The crude is produced offshore by Maersk at the rate of
20,000 b/d, to reach 30,000 b/d by end-1996.

Qatar is speeding up the diversification and privatisation of its
economy. At a conference in Doha on Jan. 8 it will present 15
industrial projects to about 300 Qatari, GCC and foreign investors.

The Prospects In OPEC Countries - SAUDI ARABIA

The situation in Saudi Arabia has improved considerably since the
Riyadh bomb explosion in November 1995 and the subsequent
hospitalisa-tion of King Fahd. The issue of succession to the throne
had been resolved prior to President Clinton's visit to the kingdom
in October 1994, and now Crown Prince Abdullah is the acting head of
state. To be the next king, he is the person who presides over
cabinet meetings and receives foreign leaders.

An air-tight power sharing agreement with "The Sudairi Seven" is yet
to materialise. But political stability is top priority for both the
conservative camp of Prince Abdullah and the progressive camp of
"The Seven". Washington will be happy with whatever arrangement both
sides may have in the coming months, provided that the outcome is
favourable, and there is a lot of horse trading going on in the
background.

The trend-setter for the neighbouring countries and the oil market,
Saudi Aramco has raised its crude oil prices for US customers in
January by 35 cents/barrel for Arabian Heavy and by 10 cents for
Extra Light. This follows changes in differentials between light and
heavy oil products and a large reduction in Saudi Aramco prices for
December.

        SAUDI PRICE DIFFERENTIALS FOR JANUARY 1996

$/barrel                       US1  Europe2  Far East3
Arabian Extra Light (Berri)  -2.05   -0.95     +1.20

Arabian Heavy                -3.70   -2.40     -0.55

Fob Ras Tanura: 1WTI, 2dated Brent, 3Oman/Dubai average

Saudi Aramco has the capacity to produce up to 10 million b/d of
OPEC speficication oil, plus 715,000 b/d of condensates and NGLs
which are excluded from the quota system. But it sticks to OPEC's 8
million b/d quota. Its monthly pricing influences the other NOCs of
the Middle East. This is particularly in the case of Kuwait's KPC,
which competes with Saudi Aramco in the US market, and of Iran's
NIOC which competes with the Saudi company in Europe and east of
Suez markets.

Riyadh wants to see crude oil prices defended by OPEC and IPEC. But
it also insists on expanding its market share.

The mix of Saudi Aramco's export crudes has become lighter and the
company has begun work on developing the Shaybah field, which will
be producing over 500,000 b/d of 42x API crude with 0.5% sulphur by
1999 and will raise Saudi supplies of such oils to almost 800,000
b/d (see detailed survey of Saudi Arabia & who's who in Vol. 45).

The UAE

Politically stable as a confederation, rather than a full union as
its name suggests, the UAE has an OPEC quota of 2.161 million b/d
and is producing slightly more than that. The Acting Minister of
Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Rakad Bin Salim Bin Rakad, stated
on Dec. 7, 1995, that the UAE's oil production capacity had reached
3 million b/d.

Most of this capacity belongs to Abu Dhabi, by far the richest among
the seven UAE emirates with huge reserves of oil and gas (see survey
& who's who in Vol. 45).

VENEZUELA

With an OPEC quota of 2.359 million b/d, Venezuela is actually
producing 2.75 million b/d and needs every dollar it can get. The
country has a deep financial crisis and a number of other problems
(see survey of Venezuela & who's who in Vol. 45, December 1995).

The Caracas government recently approved a joint venture between
Bitumenes del Orinoco (Bitor), one of PDVSA's subsidiaries, Conoco
of the US and Statoil of Norway. The JV will build a $320m plant to
produce Orimulsion, Venezuela's trademark boiler fuel excluded from
the OPEC quota. Production is to begin in 1998 at the rate of 5
million tons/year. About 80% of the output will be sold to Florida
Power and Light Co. and the remainder will be marketed in Europe.

In this JV, Bitor will hold 40%. Conoco will have a 30% stake and
Statoil will hold 20%. The remaining 10% will be held by two private
Venezuelan engineering companies.

OPEC Condensate & NGL Exports To Exceed 2.7M B/D: Production and
exports of condensates and NGLs in OPEC - excluded from the quota
system - have risen from less than 1.6 million b/d in the mid-1980s
to over 2.4 million b/d in recent months. They will exceed 2.7
million b/d before end-1996.

With further NGLs to come from large LNG export projects to be
completed in the following years, OPEC production of these liquids
could rise to more than 3.5 million b/d by 2000.

The biggest producer and exporter of these light/sweet liquids is
Saudi Aramco: 715,000 b/d to reach 720,000 b/d by end-1996. The
second is Algeria: 560,000 b/d to reach 580,000 b/d. The UAE:
326,000 b/d to reach 528,000 b/d. Indonesia: 230,000 b/d, to drop to
225,000 b/d by end-1996. Venezuela: 200,000 b/d to reach 220,000
b/d. Nigeria: 116,000 b/d to reach 130,000 b/d. Qatar: 95,000 b/d to
reach 130,000 b/d and 180,000 b/d in 1997. Kuwait: 105,000 b/d to
reach 110,000 b/d. Iran: 50,000 b/d. Libya: 30,000 b/d to reach
35,000 b/d.

GCC Economies Grow Despite Lower Spending

The economic prospects in the six Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC)
countries appear to be bright. Higher oil prices and reforms boosted
their economies in 1995 despite lower government spending and a
decline in some sectors. But the six states are entering the 16th
year of their alliance with no signs that their targeted economic
merger will materialise anytime soon.

According to local officials and bankers, the oil sector alone in
the GCC has grown by around 8% as crude oil prices averaged nearly
$17/barrel in 1995, compared with $15.50/barrel in 1994. Oil prices
in 1996 may fall if Iraq returns to the market for partial oil sales
(see Oil Market Trends).

Khalid Al Fayez, chief executive of the Kuwaiti-based Gulf
Investment Corporation (GIC), which is owned by the six GCC
governments, says: "The performance of GCC economies recorded
positive rates and the results have surpassed expectations. Such
results were much better than in 1994. This is because the rise in
oil prices hastened growth rates". Bankers have estimated the
combined GDP in the GCC would grow by around 2.1% to $207.6 billion
in 1995, from nearly $203.2 billion in 1994.

A study by Henry Azzam, chief economist of the Saudi National
Commercial Bank, shows Saudi Arabia's GDP, which accounts for nearly
a quarter of the total Arab GDP, would likely rise to around $122
billion from $120.8 billion in 1994. Kuwait's GDP would increase to
$24.2 billion in 1995 from $22.9 bn and the UAE's to $38 billion
from $36.6 bn. Oman's GDP surged by more than 12% in the first half
of 1995 and was projected to grow by over 3% by end-1995. The
economies of the two other GCC members, Bahrain and Qatar, are also
set to grow.

This is in contrast with 1994, when most of the GCC economies
declined due to low oil prices. The decline occurred mainly in
government sectors.

According to the state-run Emirates Industrial Bank in the UAE, the
improvement in crude oil prices would boost the GCC's income by
around 10% to $77 billion in 1995, from around $70 billion in 1994.
The oil sector's contribution to the GDP ranges between 30% and 40%
in the GCC. The other key sectors are construction and trade.

Mahmoud Al Jarwani, director of the Muscat Stock Exchange, said in
late 1995: "I believe all GCC economies have grown because of the
oil price improvement and government measures to restructure the
economy. But some sectors have slightly retreated due to a drop in
investments and government expenditure". Most GCC states cut
spending in 1995 as part of reforms aimed at tackling their budget
deficit and reviving their economies after they were hurt by low oil
prices. From $71.4 billion in 1994, spending was trimmed to $68.79
billion in 1995, with most of the cut made by Saudi Arabia.

Lower government spending has a direct impact on the GCC economy, as
the private sector still relies heavily on such spending given its
relatively small contribution to the GDP. But such a contribution,
estimated at 35-40%, is set to surge in the coming years as regional
states are pressing ahead with reforms, which cover privatisation,
incentives for industries and improvement laws. The sale of key
institutions to the public is expected to fetch the governments
billions of dollars and ease the burden of subsidies.

GIC's Fayez urges GCC states to pursue privatisation plans and other
reforms to repair their economies and lessen reliance on volatile
oil earnings, which still account for more than 80% of their income.
"GCC countries should be fully committed to privatisation to
liberalise their economies and end bureaucracy and red-tape. But
privatisation needs changes in the existing economic laws. It means
not only the transfer of the ownership from the government to the
private sector, but also a change in the structure of companies and
their dealings".

Obstacles To Merger: The GCC states are yet to agree on a customs
union, a joint currency and other steps required for a common
market. Bahrain, which has little oil, fears lowering its tariffs
could hit its economy in view of its heavy reliance on taxes. Saudi
Arabia is also sticking to selective high tariffs to protect its
burgeoning industries as a means of lessening dependence on oil
exports. Although the six members have eased customs barriers among
them and facilitated the entry of their citizens, inter-GCC trade
has remained as low as 10% of their total trade of more than $100
billion per annum.

Egypt-Libya Trade Is Choked By Harsh New Measures

Egypt's Marsa Matruh, the once thriving market in Libyan goods has
become a ghost town after strict measures taken by Tripoli choked
off trade across the border. There used to be 5,000 travellers a day
crossing the town. Now there is only 50 at most. Sometimes it is
completely empty.

Mohammed Al Adl, head of customs at Egypt's Salloum border post,
said last week Libya "imposed a number of strict controls which
stopped the flow of trade between the two countries". Libya slapped
100% duties on merchandise entering from Egypt. Libyan officials at
the Misaed border post "confiscate without any reason all goods and
large amounts of money from travellers" coming from Libya, Idris Eid
Ali, who crossed into Egypt said. He added: "The economic situation
in Libya is collapsing and every hour there are new contradictory
(customs) orders issued".

The Salloum border crossing has been a vital trade outlet for Libya,
under a UN air embargo since 1992 for its alleged support of
terrorism. Travel between the two countries has always been simple
for their citizens, leading to a profitable trade in cheap Libyan
merchandise in Egypt.

In the coastal town Marsa Matruh, 250 km from the border, the
markets where most of the goods from Libya were sold are all but
empty from the cut-off. A trader who deals in Libyan merchandise in
Matruh said: "The town used to be packed with people and cars and
the trading went on 24 hours a day. Now there's not a single
customer after nine o'clock. On the best day, a merchant (at Matruh)
might make about 10 Egyptian pounds ($3). There are no customers and
no new goods coming in".

Besides random confiscations of goods, Libyan officials impose heavy
insurance on merchandise leaving Libya. But then it is very
difficult for the traveller to get back the insurance. One Egyptian
customs official added: "There is no system and no (Libyan) official
to turn to to complain. Every bureaucrat small and large considers
himself unsupervised and can do whatever he wishes".

The Libyan authorities have begun refusing to fill extra petrol
tanks in travellers' cars, in a bid to crack down on drivers who
sold Libyan gasoline at "enormous profit" in Egypt. Libyan customs
also force entrants to pay 50 Libyan dinars ($15) for a health
certificate in response to an Egyptian decision to give arrivals a
health test, after reports of a cholera outbreak in Libya.

Egyptian exports to Libya in 1994 amounted to $44.2 million. Imports
from Libya were worth $47.8 million. Libya has been Egypt's third
largest Arab trading partner, after Saudi Arabia and Syria.

Trade was dealt a heavy blow in September 1995 when Libya decided to
deport the 30,000 Palestinians living on its soil. Up to 1,000 of
the several thousand Palestinians expelled were refused entry by
Egypt and settled into a tent camp in no man's land between the two
borders.

The crisis stifled trade across the border even after Libyan leader
Qadhafi decided to stop the expulsions until 1996. Over a hundred
Palestinians still remain in the tent camp under harsh conditions.

Algeria Gets BP For Its Biggest Gas Project; Talks With Exxon Begin

On Dec. 23, 1995, Sonatrach and British Petroleum signed an
agreement whereby BP and the state concern will invest about $3.5
billion to develop and market natural gas from seven fields in the
remote In Salah region. The gas will be marketed in Europe,
particularly in southern European countries, and will increase
Algeria's gas exports by more than 10 BCM/year from 2002. Further
increases in gas exports are envisaged for the following years.

The deal with BP represents the biggest foreign investment in
Algeria since it gained its independence from France in 1962. It
comes on the heels of President Zeroual's electoral victory (see OMT
& News Service of this week's APS Diplomat.

It paves the way for other international investments in Algeria's
energy sector, which accounts for virtually all the country's export
earnings, with Exxon negotiating a similar agreement for In Salah
gas.

Explored by Sonatrach, the seven fields lie in the hitherto
undeveloped In Salah District Three, about 1,200 km south of
Algiers. They are believed to be rich in natural gas and some
liquids.

In the initial phase, 30 months, BP will spend about $100 million on
an appraisal of the fields' known gas reserves, exploration and
analysis of the chemical composition of various gases in that
region. The aim of exploration is also to find other fields in
District Three. The $100 million spending will be borne by BP alone.

In Salah, a vast desert region, has 30 fields discovered by
Sonatrach. Their reserves have been estimated at between 150,000-
280,000 MCM. But BP has had doubts about these estimates and will
carefully re-assess data and the deposits at the seven fields found
in District Three.

The deal took five years to negotiate and an initial agreement in
1993. It involves a complicated arrangement relating to production
and the quality of the In Salah gas, which is poor relative to the
gas being produced at Hassi R'Mel, Algeria's main gas production
centre to the north. It includes a swap of In Salah gas for Hassi
R'Mel gas.

After the 30-month exploration phase, if the results are positive, a
five-year development programme will be launched. BP will produce 10
BCM/year from 2002 or 2003.

With gas treatment facilities to be set up at the fields, a 520-km
pipeline will be built from District Three to Hassi R'Mel. The
pipeline will cost about $1 billion. At Hassi R'Mel, the gas will be
reinjected to free more of the higher quality of the centre's gas
for export.

From there, the gas will be linked to Algeria's export network: (a)
the Trans-Med pipeline to Italy, and (b) the pipeline to Spain and
France which will pass through Morocco and the Strait of Gibraltar.

Joint gas marketing companies will be established in Europe by
Sonatrach and BP. The British major is expected to provide
considerable assistance in markets that will have become totally
deregulated by 2000 (see reports on following pages). There will be
emphasis on Germany, the largest gas market in Europe, where BP has
a stake in a major gas company.

The BP-Sonatrach partnership will last 30 years. The agreement was
signed at a ceremony in Hassi Messaoud, Algeria's southern oil
centre, by BP's CEO John Browne and Nazim Zouioueche, the head of
Sonatrach. The ceremony was attended by Ammar Makhloufi, Algeria's
minister of energy and industry.

Accordingly, BP will provide 65% of the total investment. In return,
it will get about a third of the profits. There is a confidential
portion in the agreement which provides for other companies to use
the pipeline for a fee.

Makhloufi said the BP deal would be a model for future gas
development and marketing agreements with other international
companies. Browne said: "It is the first major gas joint venture a
foreign company has signed with Sonatrach. It has the potential to
open up a new area of gas production in Algeria. He added that the
deal should raise by 30% BP's natural gas production worldwide,
which in 1994 amounted to 1.12 BCM (13 BCF).

BP will set up its own quarter at the heavily-guarded Hassi
Messaoud, where most of the 32 western oil and gas companies have a
base. It will post 25 of its staff members there and in District
Three, which will be heavily guarded by the army as well.

Browne and his aides had flown direct from London to a small
airstrip at Hassi Messaoud, where the army has heavy fortifications
against Islamic militants. BP will be hiring its own security
experts there and in District Three, and will be chartering its own
aircraft for the staff - as the other foreign operators in Algeria
have done.

At least six army units guard the installations in and around Hassi
Messaoud. At the air strip, soldiers with AK-47 assault rifles stand
silhouetted at the top of the surrounding, honey-coloured sand
dunes. The area is part of four exclusion zones in the south,
established in mid-1995, requiring special permission for entry by
visitors. Soldiers are stationed outside many pumping stations
across the desert. Helicopters routinely monitor the pipelines,
which are buried 3 to 4 metres under the sand.

Exxon Negotiations: Initial negotiations between Sonatrach and Exxon
began in the past week with the aim of signing a gas partnership
deal similar to BP's. If an agreement is signed, which Minister
Makhloufi hopes would be within 1996, Exxon would take some of the
remaining In Salah fields.

After an initial period for field appraisal and exploration, if the
results are positive, Exxon would develop the structures.
Eventually, it would use the 520-km pipeline to Hassi R'Mel which BP
will build from In Salah. Makhloufi says there would be a total of
three to four partnerships with foreign companies for In Salah gas.

Total-Sonatrach Gas Deal

Sonatrach and Total of France were this week expected to sign a
contract for the development of a gas field at Tin Fouye Tadankort
(TFT). The field lies in south-eastern Algeria near the Libyan
border.

The contract involves a production sharing arrangement. The French
company will cover most of the investment required and projects
there include a pipeline to link the gas with Algeria's network.

On Dec. 22, Minister Makhloufi and officials from Sonatrach
inaugurated oil and condensate processing facilities at Bin Rebba,
part of the Hamra field development undertaken by Total. They also
inaugurated Total's new gas treatment complex built at Hamra. The
Hamra project, to produce LPG as well as condensates, includes a
joint Sonatrach-Total company to market the LPG.

Zouioueche, the head of Sonatrach, says Algeria is taking steps to
maintain the momentum of foreign interest and investment. New
exploration acreage will be offered for foreign companies, although
Algeria appears more interested in negotiating specific arrangements
with individual companies than in launching a new international
bidding round. He says there is a continual reassessment of the
fiscal terms being offered to foreign companies. "We think the
current ones are attractive enough, but we must be prepared to adapt
to growing international competition", he adds.

Zouioueche has ambitious plans to revitalise Sonatrach. "Our goal",
he says, "is to have a state company that is managed like a private
company". He is keen to expand international activities. Algerian
officials say part of the attraction of the BP deal, and the one
with Exxon to follow, is that it opens the prospect of moving into
new "middle stream markets" in Europe, such as power generation.

Zouioueche says Sonatrach, which already has a stake in Anadarko,
the US oil explorer, is keen to acquire additional overseas assets.
That could include taking equity in other companies, including gas
marketing companies in Europe. "We're open to any possibilities to
become more international", he says.

At home, Sonatrach will be offering more opportunities for foreign
companies to take part in rehabilitating existing oilfields.
Zouioueche says a $1.3 bn contract on enhanced oil recovery being
negotiated with Arco will form the basis for future oilfield
rehabilitation projects. "But we can't do other ones until the Arco
deal is signed", for the Rhourde El Baguel oilfield (see details in
survey of Algeria in Review's Vol. 44).

Anadarko, meanwhile, has begun negotiating with Chemical Bank and
other banks to finance the development of 1.5 billion barrels of oil
reserves it has found in Algeria. Its partners in these reserves are
Lasmo of the UK and Maersk of Denmark.

The reserves lie in the group's Hassi Berkine fields which, if
developed as planned by Anadarko, would produce 40,000 b/d from late
1996 or early 1997. A full-scale development, to cost over $1
billion, would raise its production to 300,000 b/d by 2000. The
fields will produce natural gas as well.

The European Gas Market Develops; The British Could Buy From Retail
Shops

A spot market in natural gas developed in 1995 at Bacton, on the
British east coast, is becoming the main price market for spot
trades in Europe. With the players having acquired experience from
trading in North Sea oil, it provides forward contracts. Eventually
this would lead to a gas futures market similar to that of NYMEX in
New York which was launched in 1990.

However, the new spot market has caused the gas industry a serious
crisis. As a result of free competition in less than six months, gas
prices fell to about 10 pence a therm ($1.55/million BTU) in
November 1995.

To compare, the value of natural gas in Britain in November 1994 was
almost 20 pence a therm ($3.10/million BTU).

Further pressures on gas prices in Europe would be expected by April
1998, when the UK gas and power businesses will be totally
deregulated. From then on, British consumers could buy electricity
or gas at the supermarket or in chain stores. This form of trade
will influence price trends at Bacton.

Many big retailers have already had talks with the British
electricity regulatory body, Offer, about plans to sell power as
from 1998. They have had negotiations with British Gas for the
retailing of both gas and electricity, though BG is having its own
retailing plans.

The British electricity regulator, Prof. Stephen Littlechild, said
on Dec. 28 that many retailers were considering the sale of
electricity and gas once regional distributors lose their monopoly
in supplying households. The market for 20 million British
households is worth about $12.5 billion per annum. He told 'The
Times': "All of these (retail) chains realise that they have
strengths and the resources which could be of use in the electricity
market".

No new wires for power or pipelines for gas will be required.
Retailers would use their purchasing power to buy large supplies of
gas and electricity at bulk discounts, and then could sell the
unused surplus to customers. The gas or power distributor would
receive a fee from the retailer to reroute the supplies.

According to Littlechild, supermarkets are well placed to sell
electricity in the free-for-all consumer market about to be created:
they are used to driving hard bargains with suppliers and making
slim margins on large volumes. As large-scale customers, these
retailers have been able to achieve savings of 30% or more on their
bills through a competitive tender process. This involves the
various private sector suppliers.

British Gas, the former state monopoly, is already bracing for the
tough new competitive market. It has secured a licence to supply
households with both gas and electricity, in the expectation that
consumers would prefer one major and reliable supplier.

NYMEX Begins Trading New Futures Based West Texas Gas

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) this week was expected to
begin trading a new gas futures contract based on delivery at the
Permian pool of El Paso Natural Gas Company in West Texas. The
contract is partly similar to the one trading on the NYMEX market
since 1990, with its gas based on the Henry Hub in Louisiana.

The difference is that the Louisiana-based contract expires on the
sixth to the last business day of the month, whereas the new near-
month contract expires on the third to the last business day. The
new contract competes with the Western gas futures contract of the
Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT), which is based on the Waha Hub in
west Texas. The KCBT Western contract expires on the fifth to the
last business day of the month.

NYMEX has promoted the idea since mid-1995. It wants to give traders
in natural gas futures an alternative site to trade. This is to give
further arbitrage opportunities.
