  This article reviews the legal basis of inclusion of students with 
disabilities in regular education settings, focusing on students with behavior 
disorders.  It examines case law and extrapolates principles from these cases, 
including the Daniel R. R. standard, the Rachel H. standard, and the Clyde K. 
and Sheila K. versus Puyallup School District case.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  The Mentor Supported School Success Program was developed by the rural school 
district of Dorchester County, Maryland, as an effort to include students 
displaying troubling behaviors in regular classroom settings.  The program 
offers supplementary support to current school programming through the use of 
mentors.  In the first year of the program, members of the school-based 
multidisciplinary team identified students exhibiting troublesome behaviors, 
with priority given to elementary-aged students previously recommended for 
expulsion.  All students are eligible for participation.  Paraprofessionals and 
substitute teachers who had demonstrated both empathy for students and 
consistent effective behavioral management strategies were selected as mentors. 
Mentors assist with individual behavioral management plans, support classroom 
activities, provide additional monitoring of non-academic activities, and help 
teach the social skills training program.  Program components include 
integrated behavior management plans for each student; daily orientation and 
wrap-up; carefully designed mentor schedules; academic assistance; monitoring 
of medications; crisis intervention; social skills training; and evaluation of 
changes in students' behavior, attendance, and academic achievement.  A mid-year informal review suggests positive results in all four pilot elementary 
schools.  (JAT)<BR>

  Peers' Perceptions of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders: What Are Students 
Thinking?<BR>
  Safran, Stephen P.<BR>
  Journal of Emotional and Behavioral Disorders, v3 n2 p66-75 Apr   1995<BR>
  ISSN: 1063-4266<BR>
  Language: English<BR>
  Document Type: JOURNAL ARTICLE (080);  REVIEW LITERATURE (070)<BR>
  Journal Announcement: CIJSEP95<BR>
  This article analyzes research on children's perceptions of emotional and 
behavioral difficulties.  Virtually all studies concur that peers hold negative 
views of externalizing behavior problems.  Findings suggest that professionals 
need to target peer-identified behavioral and social skill goals and develop 
programming aimed at normalization to improve acceptance in integrated settings.

  This paper reviews research on observational learning, including model 
characteristics and observers' responses, vicarious reinforcement as implicit 
punishment, vicarious effects on students with problem behavior, observers' 
other characteristics and vicarious effects, and aggression and vicarious 
processes.  Regular class placement of students with emotional/behavioral 
disorders is determined to be insufficient in ensuring imitation of appropriate 
peer models.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  Implementation of a social skill training package with three elementary-school children
who had behavioral and learning disorders resulted in  increasing student acquisition of
targeted social behaviors, which in turn led  to lengthier peer interactions.  Increases in
nontargeted social responses were  also demonstrated.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This article suggests ways in which special educators of students with  emotional and
behavioral disorders can introduce puppets into their classrooms  as educational and
therapeutic instruments.  Puppets are able to help students  identify problems and find
rational solutions in a nonthreatening situation.   Two sample applications are included.

  This study examined the effectiveness of an instructional system (a modified  version
of the School Survival Skills Curriculum) in developing and improving  the school
survival skills of students with behavioral disorders.  Using a  pretest-posttest group
design, subjects demonstrated improvement in overall use  of school survival skills but
no significant differences in grade point  averages.  (Author/JDD)<BR>   Descriptors:

  Three elementary students with behavioral disorders were trained to use a  cognitive
"cover, copy, and compare" strategy to learn division facts.  Two  students increased
their rate of correct responding to mastery level, the third  student required additional
feedback and goal setting, and all three students  maintained increased rates of correct
responding at follow-up.  (Author/JDD)  <BR> Descriptors: Arithmetic; *Behavior
