July, 1996


<h3>More Children Being Home Schooled</h3>

<p><CITE>Education Week</CITE>  (June 12, 1996) reported that Home
Schooling is becoming more mainstream" -- increasing, "not just in their
numbers, but in the diversity of philosophies, politics, and approaches
represented in their burgeoning ranks." Home schooling is beginning to be
viewed as a "viable educational option" (1 to 2 percent of the K-12
population). Home schooling is legal in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. Thirty-four states regulate home-schooling. Forty states do not
require any parent qualifications for teaching. Few states ask why
parents are home-schooling their children, but reasons given range from
"school violence to poor academic quality to overzealous peer pressure."
Observers have seen "growing numbers of habitual truants, gifted
children, children with disabilities, and in general, older children and
teens being educated at home."

<h3>Student Standards for Speaking, Listening</h3>
<p><cite> Education Week </cite> (June 12, 1996)

<p>The Speech Communication Association released national voluntary
standards for speaking, listening, and media literacy that are meant to
apply across the curriculum. These standards are different from the
International Reading Association and National Council of Teachers of
English English-Language Arts standards because they focus on spoken
language. Free copies of these standards are available from Speech
Communication Associates, 5105 Blacklick Road, Building E, Annandale, VA
22003.

<h3>Teacher Licensing Project Begun by NCATE</h3>
<p><cite>Education Week </CITE>(April 17, 1996)

<p>The National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education and 7
selected states (Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, North
Carolina, Washington) are working to reform teacher preparation and
licensing. Their goal is to establish state standards for teacher
preparation and licensing that is focused on teacher performance rather
than specified coursework. These standards would be "aligned with NCATE's
standards for teacher education school."

<h3>Educators Skeptical About New Tests</h3>
<p><CITE> Education Week</CITE>  (April 17, 1996)

<p>Teachers in Maryland and Kentucky (states that re-vamped the way they
measure student performance) question whether the new measures really
"gauge what students have learned." These states replaced standardized
achievement test with performance-based testing programs. The new tests
consist of "problem solving, participation in group activities, answering
open-ended questions, and writing." While many teachers said the new
assessments improved instruction, most teachers in both states also said
they thought some schools had found ways to "improve scores without
improving the quality of teaching." Most said the scores improved
"because the teachers and students were more familiar with the test,
students did practice tests, and the test-taking skills had improved." If
the teachers concerns are right, the gains reported "probably don't
represent generalizable gains in student learning." In both states 70
percent or more of the teachers said they had put more emphasis on
subjects and topics that were tested, reducing emphasis on those that
were not. Contrary to the "commitment to the belief that all children can
learn at high levels, the survey clearly suggests that many teachers
still believe some students can learn more than others." In Maryland,
"only 18 percent of teachers said they had increased expectations for
special-education students." Thirty-six percent said they "expected more
of their high-achieving students. The real test was said to be "whether
there will continue to be gains."

<h3>Teacher Attrition a Concern</h3>
<p><CITE> Education Week </CITE> (June 19, 1996)

 <p>A survey of new teachers in North Carolina "brought bad news and worse
news. The bad news was the large number of rookie teachers who leave the
profession within five years. Even worse, the ones who are quitting are
the brightest of the new teachers." 

<p>A review of the records of 81,000 teachers hired in 1979-80 found that
by the end of the fifth year after being hired, one-third had left teaching.
"And the survey showed that after five years of teaching, 44 percent of
teachers who came from colleges considered to be in the top one-fourth in
the state had left, compared with only 26 percent of teachers coming from
the bottom one-fourth of colleges." This high attrition rate for teachers
is not only in North Carolina. According to the National Commission 
on Teaching, 30 to 50 percent of beginning teachers leave the profession
in their first five years. Other studies have shown that new teachers
"tend to feel overwhelmed by classroom responsibilities and often do not
receive proper support."

<h3>Private Management of Public Schools Has Yet to Show Improved Scores</h3>
<p><CITE> Education Week  </CITE> (May 29, 1996) 

<p>The U.S. General Accounting Office recently released a report
indicating that "private management of public schools has often led to
cleaner buildings, greater access to computers, and more individualized
instruction. But it has yet to show academic improvement anywhere..." The
private management groups examined were: Public Strategies Group Inc. in
Minneapolis and Education Alternatives Inc. in Baltimore; Dade County,
Fla.; and Hartford, Conn. (Scores in Hartford were not evaluated.)  EAI's
contracts were either not renewed or ended ahead of schedule. PSI in
Minneapolis received only 66 percent of the total it could have received
because, among other reasons, student test scores did not improve.
