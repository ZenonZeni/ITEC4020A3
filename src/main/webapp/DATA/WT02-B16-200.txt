<h2>From Cells to Arrays</h2>

<p><font size=+2>T</font>he PV cell is the basic unit in a PV system.  An individual PV cell typically produces between
1 and 2 watts, hardly enough power for the great majority of applications.  But we can increase the
power by connecting cells together to form larger units called modules.  Modules, in turn, can be
connected to form even larger units known as arrays, which can be interconnected for more
power, and so on.  In this way, we can build a PV system to meet almost any power need, no
matter how small or great.

<p>Modules or arrays, by themselves, do not constitute a PV system. We must also have structures
on which to put them and point them toward the sun, and components that take the <a href="acdc.html">direct-current
(dc)</a> electricity produced by the modules or arrays and condition the electricity so it can be used
in the specific application.  These structures and components are referred to as the <a href="balance.html">
balance of system (BOS)</a>.

<p><font color="#F79D00">The basic photovoltaic cell typically produces only a small
amount of power.  To produce more power, cells can be interconnected to form modules, which
can in turn be connected into arrays to produce yet more power.  Because of this modularity, PV
systems may be designed to meet any electrical requirement, no matter how large or how small.</font>
