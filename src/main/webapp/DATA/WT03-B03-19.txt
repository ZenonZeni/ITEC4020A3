INDIA: Strong buying interest fuels Thermax and affects performance at
other companies

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by T.B. Kapali & Krishnan Thiagarajan

THE Bombay Stock Exchange failed to shake off the bear hug as the
30-share Sensitive Index plummeted further by around 13 points to
close the day at 3,226.80. The value of  business  transacted  at
the exchange dropped sharply from Rs. 349.95 crores to Rs. 297.58
crores. With 1,276 stocks appreciating  in  value  against  1,061
declining in value, the advances to decline ratio stood at 1.20.

Thermax hogged the limelight during the day's trading.  The  trad
ing volumes in the stock shot up from  7,000  shares  during  Mon
day's trading to 50,900 shares on Tuesday. The stock  price  rose
by Rs. 0.50 to settle for the day at Rs. 415.

Indian Petrochemicals  Corporation  (IPCL)  marginally  recovered
some lost ground to appreciate by Rs. 2.25 to settle for the  day
at Rs. 113.50 on the back of strong trading volumes. The  trading
volumes spiralled from 4,54,060  shares  on  Monday  to  4,60,420
shares during the day.

Recent news reports reveal that the company, besides being hit by
an unfavourable Budget, has also closed down its xylene plant for
the past three to four months due to poor offtake  from  domestic
producers. The bottomline is likely to be  affected  as  a  conse
quence. Over the last  week,  the  stock  had  consistently  shed
value.

The Modern Threads stock registered a gain of Rs. 1 to settle for
the day at Rs. 76.50 accompanied by a surge in  trading  volumes.
The trading volumes soared from 3,355 shares  to  21,262  shares.
Modern Threads is coming out with a rights/public issue of 18 per
cent fixed  convertible  debentures  (FCD)  to  part-finance  its
paraxylene-purified terepthalic acid project.

The Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) stock  gained  Rs.  6  to
close for the day at Rs.  287.50.  The  trading  volumes  in  the
stock, however, declined from 1,89,300 shares to  99,200  shares.
The company has  deferred  its  Rs.  412.50-crore  maiden  equity
issue, which was to expected to open for subscription  late  next
month, on account of the poor market sentiment.

The Himachal  Futuristic  Communication  (HFCL)  stock  attracted
heavy trading volumes, which soared from

1,400 shares to 1,00,700 shares. The stock price moved up by  Rs.
1.15 to rest for the day at Rs. 14.65.

The ACC stock ended the day at Rs. 1,760,  down  Rs.  19.75  from
Monday's close of Rs. 1,779.75. The volume of  shares  traded  in
this counter rose from 15,636 to 36,161 shares. This stock, which
had been ruling at around Rs. 2,025 about a month and a half ago,
rose to around Rs. 2,160 towards August-end and  early-September.
But, it moved back to the Rs. 2,025-level in mid-September.

Since then, it has been on a steady decline, and  closed  at  Rs.
1,779.75 on Monday. The trading  volumes  have  also  been  quite
heavy in the last month and a half with an average  daily  volume
being about 18,000 shares.

The Sesa Goa stock  also  moved  southwards  as  trading  volumes
increased sharply,  indicating  intense  selling  pressure.  From
1,350 shares traded on Monday, the quantity of business  in  this
counter rose substantially to 25,345 shares on Tuesday.

The scrip shed Rs. 9.25 to close the day  at  Rs.  180.25.  Price
movements in this scrip also fall into two distinct periods  over
the last month and a half. From the Rs. 329-level  in  the  third
week of August, the scrip gained initially to  touch  around  Rs.
360-370 in the second week of September. But there  was  a  sharp
drop in values in the subsequent period, when it fell  to  around
Rs. 310 and then to around Rs. 290.  The  plunge  continued  with
about Rs. 70 lost in a single day's trading on  September  18  as
the scrip ended that day at Rs. 221. It has since moved  down  to
the current levels.

Sterlite Industries also  continued  its  downward  journey.  The
scrip ended the day at Rs. 177, down Rs. 8.75 from Monday's close
of Rs. 185.75. From 47,832 shares  that  changed  hands  in  this
counter on Monday, the number of shares traded almost doubled  to
Rs. 91,945 shares in the day's trading.

INDIA: National Panasonic launching new products

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Staff Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

NATIONAL Panasonic is launching  a  whole  new  range  of  colour
television sets and audio systems in the Indian market.  The  new
products, to be introduced next month, include 11  colour  televi
sion (CTV) models and three audio systems.

Announcing the launch, Mr. Toshi Nakajima, Managing  Director  of
National Panasonic India Pvt Ltd, said at the core of Panasonic's
technology was the realisation that picture quality was the  most
important element influencing purchases even in the case  of  the
Indian consumer. Every Panasonic TV was a multi-system  with  106
receivable channels and hyper band, he said. No other  colour  TV
brand in India offered hyper band in all models.

The new TV models include a 47' wide projection TV, to be  priced
at approximately Rs. 2.40 lakhs, a model in the 32'  width  range
to be priced at about Rs. 1.25 lakhs and two models in the `GAOO'
series priced at Rs. 65,000 and Rs. 59,000 each.  This  would  be
the first time in the Indian consumer electronics market that  11
CTV models are being launched simultaneously by any company.

The new audio systems being  launched  include  two  mini  stereo
compos with 5-CD changers and a premium  segment  60+1CD  changer
with 1,600 watts PMPO. All these models are equipped with  patent
ed Panasonic MASH  technology  for  noise  reduction  and  V-Bass
circuitry for ensuring deep bass.

Panasonic launched its products in the Capital in  December  1994
and later all over the country.  The  company  sold  as  many  as
60,000 CTVs last year, which represented  3.5  per  cent  of  the
Indian market. It expects to sell about 1,00,000 sets,  represent
ing 5 per cent of the projected market size, this year.

Currently, the company is importing four out of the 11 CTV models
and the other seven models are being produced indigenously.

A company statement said the  commitment  to  excellence  in  all
spheres such as manufacturing, marketing,  research  and  develop
ment and customer  care  of  Matsushita  Electric  worldwide  was
sought to be incorporated in the operations of National Panasonic
India too. Worldwide, Panasonic hopes to manufacture and sell  10
million CTVs this year. It would represent about nine per cent of
the total international demand for CTVs.

Indian Oil Corp unveils Rs. 35,000-cr. investment plans

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Principal Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

EVEN as Indian  Oil  Corporation  unveiled  long-term  investment
plans of Rs. 35,000 crores here on Tuesday,  officials  indicated
the company would tap the market only in the next fiscal. Neither
a public issue nor a bonds offering was envisaged in the  current
fiscal.

The IOC CMD, Mr. R. K. Narang, said the corporation was  revising
the size of its Paradeep refinery, being  set  up  in  consortium
with Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, to 12 MMTPA from 6 MMTPA.

Official sources said the corporation  would  meet  its  resource
requirements through  internal  accruals  in  1996-97  and  might
launch its initial public offering in the next fiscal. The  bonds
offering, too, would materialise only next year,  said  the  offi
cials. They also said the  corporation  was  considering  issuing
bonus shares before the Government disinvestment. (The Centre  is
disinvesting 5 per cent stake).

Profits are expected to rise to Rs. 1,800 crores in 1996-97.  The
four focus areas for the corporation are upgradation of  existing
facilities, expansion of infrastructure and customer  facilities,
entry into new segments and globalisation of  operations,  includ
ing consultancy.

The corporation has projects of Rs. 10,000  crores  on  hand  and
investments of Rs. 25,000 crores have been identified.  The  Para
deep refinery, expected to go on stream by 2001, would involve an
investment to the tune of Rs. 10,085 crores, Mr. Narang at a news
conference.

Although IOC has obtained approval for only a 6 MMTPA refinery at
Paradeep, it now plans to move a proposal for a 12 MMTPA unit  on
the basis of the recommendation  of  the  recently  completed  de
tailed feasibility report. A product pipeline, linking  the  Para
deep refinery to high consumption  centres  such  as  Ranchi,  is
envisaged as an add-on.

Mr. Narang also  officially  confirmed  that  the  memorandum  of
understanding between IOC and the Saudi  giant  Aramco  was  off,
since the latter was setting up a refinery in Punjab  with  Hindu
stan Petroleum Corporation. The  IOC-Aramco  venture  was  for  a
refinery project in the same region.

Mr. Narang said the company had been intimated that it could  set
up power plants based on residual fuels,  such  as  furnace  oil,
near its refineries. Naptha, as a base, however, was  ruled  out.
The company's memorandum of understanding with the Punjab  Govern
ment for a power plant at Bhatinda still stood.

Projects for production of  MTBE  and  butene-I  at  Gujarat  and
propylene in Panipat were already in progress.  LNG  imports  and
production of paraxylene, linear alkyl benzene and ACN were  also
on the anvil, he said.

The corporation is prioritising globalisation of its  consultancy
services, R&D activities and lubricants marketing. It  has  envis
aged an investment of over Rs. 8,000 crores marketing  infrastruc
ture. Expansion of capacity at various refineries has  also  been
planned.

Securities & Exchange Board of India insists stock exchanges verify payment
of all commissions & brokerages

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

MUMBAI: The Securities and Exchange Board of  India  (SEBI)  will
insist  that  the  stock  exchanges  verify   whether   all   the
commissions  and  brokerages  have  been  paid  before   allowing
companies to use the proceeds of a public issue. The  Association
of Merchant Bankers of India (AMBI) had presented a  proposal  to
SEBI for the creation of a separate account in which the all  the
proceeds due to the intermediaries would be deposited. SEBI is of
the view that as a regulatory body, it should not involve  itself
with the  enforcement  of  commercial  transactions  between  the
intermediary and the  issuer,  as  the  company  is  not  in  its
jurisdiction.

Indian Petrochemicals Corp hikes DMT price

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

MUMBAI: Indian Petrochemical Corporation Ltd has hiked its  price
for DMT to Rs. 25,500 per tonne for October from  Rs  22,000  per
tonne. The hike follows the uptrend in  international  prices  of
DMT. The company has, however, cut its price for acrylonitrile to
Rs. 32,000 per  tonne  from  Rs.  42,000  per  tonne,  to  remain
competitive against cheaper imports of the material and  expedite
liquidation of stocks. Prices of heavy alkalites have dropped  to
Rs. 15,000 per tonne from Rs. 17,000 per tonne. The hike  in  the
prices of DMT by IPCL follows the increase by  Bombay  Dyeing  by
Rs. 3,500 per tonne to Rs. 28,500 per tonne.

INDIA: Guarantee for Cogentrix "close on line"

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

BANGALORE: Mangalore Power Company, the joint venture promoted by
Cogentrix and China Light to set  up  a  1000  MW  thermal  power
project in Mangalore,  will  get  its  counter  guarantee  "very
soon". It may be recalled that the Power  Ministry  had  earlier
issued a deadline for granting the counter guarantees for all the
eight fast track projects pending  before  it  for  approval,  by
September  30.  Mr.  P.  Abraham,  Union  Power  Secretary,  told
Business Line: "It was a self imposed  deadline...an  optimistic
deadline. You (the media) have already  been  penalising  me  for
that, so now I don't want to  give  you  any  date  (as  to  when
Cogentrix  would  get  its  counter  guarantee)."  He,  however,
stated, "it is close on line."

INDIA: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone develops WebDeFax

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

TOKYO: Now, you can easily view faxed documents on your  personal
computer hooked up to the local-area networks (LANs),  thanks  to
the WebDeFax, a new system  developed  by  Nippon  Telegraph  and
Telephone    Corporation    (NTT),    the     country's     major
telecommunications  giant.  According  to  NTT,  the  new  system
converts the fax into a HyperText Markup Language (HTML) document
and then stores it on a World Wide Web (WWW) server. WWW  browser
software is used to view the fax on a PC. In other words,  a  fax
can be received by simply hooking a PC to the Internet and a  fax
machine can transmit to a PC that is connected to  the  Internet.
The Web browser provides an interface at the  receiving  end  and
the system can be integrated with other groupware  products  that
use a Web  browser  for  the  user  interface,  such  as  a  time
management programme. NTT said the  system  was  also  compatible
with the Media Agent/GW system, which allows electronic  mail  to
be forwarded to fax machines and pagers using the same  procedure
as sending e-mail. NTT plans to put the WebDeFax on the  Japanese
market before the end of the year.

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

DALAL STREET: Equities on the Bombay Stock Exchange  (BSE)  moved
in a narrow range on Tuesday on account of lack of  support  from
institutions, both foreign and domestic. The BSE sensitive  index

The market opened at 3249.15 and touched the day's low of 3220.05
points. The BSE National index ended at  1447.43  points,  losing
over two points over the previous close. The  total  turnover  on
the exchange was 1.98 crore shares worth Rs. 297.57 crores. While
the market moved listlessly, heavy short-covering  was  witnessed
in ITC towards the end of the session on the  NSE.  According  to
brokers, operators in Calcutta had huge short  positions  in  ITC
with the scrip gaining Rs. 2 over the previous close  to  end  at
Rs. 302.25. Foreign funds were once again selling  SBI  with  the

Tempo, Sesa Goa, NIIT, BHEL, HDFC  Bank,  Dr.  Reddy's  Labs  and

and share prices on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended lower
in end-account trade. The 50-share NSE index  touched  a  low  of
933.56 points before closing at 936.27, losing 7.69  points  over
the previous close. The net traded value was  Rs.  987.87  crores
and the net traded quantity was 521.11 lakh shares. Shares of ITC
were in the limelight on  account  of  hectic  short-covering  by
speculators. The share gained Rs. 4 to end at Rs. 306 with shares
worth Rs. 163.40 crores traded. State Bank of India edged down to
Rs. 251 from the previous Rs. 252 in moderate  trade  with  deals
aggregating Rs. 468.58 crores. IPCL also moved up by Rs. 4 to Rs.
116 on short-covering. Shares worth Rs. 24.80 crores were traded.
The other active shares include Reliance,  Bajaj  Auto,  Bank  of
Rajasthan, NIIT, BHEL, Tata  Tea,  Hindalco,  Oriental  Bank  and
Brooke Bond Lipton. The National bourse is closed on Wednesday on
account of Gandhi Jayanti.

LYONS RANGE: ITC remained at the  centre-stage  at  the  Calcutta
Stock Exchange on Tuesday. In an otherwise dull market, the scrip
improved as a result of concerted buying in all the  major  stock
exchanges.  Among  the  other  pivotals,   while   Reliance   was
unchanged, Tisco and SBI declined. The CSE Sensitive Index  eased
to 423.38 points from the previous close of  424.61  points.  The
overall volume was poor. ITC opened higher at Rs. 303 against the
previous closing of Rs. 302, then  shot  up  to  Rs.  306.25  but
declined on profit-taking to close at Rs.  303.  Tisco  lost  Rs.
1.50 at Rs. 173. Reliance, moving on a very thin groove, returned
to the previous close of Rs. 192. SBI surrendered Rs.  3  at  Rs.
250.50. ACC was down by Rs. 10 at Rs. 1,775 and L&T at close sold
at Rs. 232, a rupee down from the previous level. CESC,  however,
inched ahead by 25 paise to Rs. 63.75 and Hind Motor improved  by
10 paise to Rs. 18.80. Bata was down by Rs. 3 at Rs. 62.

MADRAS: Sentiment at the Madras Stock Exchange (MSE) continued to
remain weak,  with  prices  of  most  scrips  maintained  at  the
previous close. The market, which opened  weak,  dropped  further
during close. The  MSE  share  price  index  closed  at  3373.27,
reflecting a  loss  of  1.44  points  over  the  previous  close.
Pivotals Reliance and Tisco witnessed some  buying  interest  but
prices moved in a narrow band. Going against the trend,  however,
was ITC which closed at better levels than Monday. Market sources
said the weak trend was reflective of the trend in bourses across
the country. Tuesday being settlement day,  there  was  a  slight
improvement  in  volumes.  FIIs  continued  to   maintain   their
wait-and-watch attitude. Low-priced counters also did not witness
much activity. The exchange will remain closed  on  Wednesday  on
account of Gandhi Jayanti.

DELHI: The stock market showed a mixed trend when  select  scrips
continued to forge ahead on persistent speculative-cum-investment
buying while a few others  lacked  the  necessary  follow-up  and
declined. Institutional  support  was  negligible  and  upcountry
advices were weak. The market opened on a steady  note  and  soon
some scrips met with fresh offerings  and  declined,  while  some
others continued to attract speculative  support  and  rose.  The
Delhi Stock Exchange sensitive  index,  however,  eased  by  2.50
points to settle at 719.74 points. In the specified section, ACC,
Asian Hotels, Bajaj Auto, BSES, Hind Lever, ITC  Hotels  and  ITC
improved on increased speculative buying. On the other hand, DCM,
Apollo Tyres, ICICI, IPCL, L&T, MTNL,  Reliance  Industries,  SBI
and Telco declined on profit selling. In the cash  section,  Bank
of Rajasthan, Dewan Rubber, Modern Syntex, Monnet Industries  and
Reliance Capital rose on brisk  investment  support  while  Dewan
Tyres, Dr. Wellman's Homeopathic  Labs,  Escorts  Finance,  Hotel
Leela, Jindal Iron, Jindal  Strips,  Kuber  Auto,  Padmini  Poly,
Ramanuj Leasing and Saw  Pipes  met  with  selling  pressure  and
declined.

BANGALORE: A dull trend prevailed on the Bangalore Stock Exchange
with most of the counters failing to receive buying support.  The
volumes were low during the day. After a  bearish  trend  in  the
previous session, the market commenced on  a  dull  note.  Though
there was no fresh selling pressure  in  the  opening  hour,  the
volumes were low and the operators were unwilling to  take  fresh
positions. According to market sources, the general sentiment has
been hesitant in the last  couple  of  weeks.  With  the  primary
markets being active, the investor funds have been minimal in the
secondary markets. Despite the low volumes, most of the  pivotals
ruled firm in Tuesday's  trading.  Reliance,  for  instance,  was
steady at around Rs. 191 and SBI moved up to Rs. 255  during  the
day. The activity in local shares was limited.

HYDERABAD: The near total absence of financial  institutions  and
FIIs from the stock market had a lot to do with  the  decline  in
select scrips. As such, the lowest turnover of Rs.  48  lakhs  in
the last three decades was registered  on  Tuesday.  Brokers  say
that unless some sops  are  given  to  the  capital  market,  the
sentiment is not likely to improve. The Hyderabad Stock  Exchange
(HSE) authorities should take some remedial measures to  gear  up
the trading process. The HSE recorded a meagre turnover of Rs. 48
lakhs in 188 transactions involving 1,71,826 shares of 86 scrips.
The scrips which remained  dormant  were  Ashok  Polymers,  Asian
Polymers, Kreb's Bio,  Livewell  Home,  Nath  Securities,  Sanghi
Polyesters, Sri Krishna Drugs, Sri Vasavi Steels,  Sujana  Steels
and V.R. Mathur Mass Comm. Among the losers were H.G.  Portfolio,
Indo-Asian Housing Corporation, Northeast  Securities,  Sharpscan
and Prints, V.B.C. Ferro Alloys and Vini Metaspin.  However,  the
scrips of Amar Raja Batteries, L.N. Polyesters and Sibar  Finance
were among the gainers.

INDIA: COMMODITIES, 10-02-96: Precious metals decline

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Both the  precious  metals  declined  moderately  on  the  Mumbai
bullion market on Tuesday. Silver  declined  in  the  absence  of
industrial demand and in the wake of  increased  arrivals.  Lower
international advices dampened the sentiment. Gold prices dropped
on account of increased stockists offerings in the wake of  fresh
arrivals as against poor local buying interest. Silver ready .999
fineness and tenderable silver both declined by Rs.  25  each  to
Rs. 6,900 and Rs. 6,905 respectively. Raw  silver  .916  fineness
dropped by Rs. 30 to Rs. 6,800. Standard gold eased by Rs. 10  to
Rs. 5,105. 22-carat gold was nominally quoted lower by Rs. 10  to
Rs. 4,720. Ten-tola gold bar .999 purity moved down by Rs. 100 to
Rs. 59,700.

INDIA: Costly amputation: Ponni Sugars

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Ponni Sugars' decision to sell its 2,500 TCD (tonnes crushed  per
day) sugar unit at Erode to a  group  company,  Seshasayee  Paper
Boards, may not augur well for its share price.  The  Erode  unit
has been the mainstay of the company's operations, being its only
unit with an established command area. With the sale of the Erode
unit, business volumes  will  have  to  come  entirely  from  the
company's units at Bolangir and Bargarh  in  Orissa,  where  cane
availability has posed frequent problems for the company  in  the
past. Both these units have been operating at less  than  50  per
cent capacity utilisation over the past two years. As the sale of
the Erode unit creates considerable uncertainties about the  near
term business prospects of  Ponni  Sugars,  the  share  price  is
likely to remain under selling pressure.

INDIA: Strained margins: Non-disbursal of ad hoc subsidies due to
di-ammonium phosphate producers

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

The reported non-disbursal of the ad  hoc  subsidies  due  to  di
ammonium phosphate (DAP) producers since December 1995, is likely
to adversely impact the first half financial results (1996-97) of
companies such as Godavari Fertilisers, Zuari Agro and FACT.  The
subsidies have not been disbursed on  account  of  the  delay  by
respective State Governments in certifying the sales, which is  a
prerequisite for disbursement. Delays in realisation of  revenues
at a time  when  the  industry  is  already  facing  considerable
pressure on the profit margins on  account  of  spiralling  input
costs, could strain the finances of DAP producers.

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Krishnan Thiagarajan

The  BSE  Sensex  continued  its  downward  course  relentlessly,
shedding another 15 points on Monday. With the Sensex registering
a consistent decline, the stocks which have  lost  lustre  assume
relevance and  include  some  heavyweights  such  as  HDFC,  ACC,
Century Textiles, BSES, Apollo Tyres and Pfizer. While HDFC  shed
Rs. 398.75 over the last fortnight, ACC lost around Rs.  380  and

INDIA-FAST TRACK: Housing Development Finance Corp

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

HDFC: The share price has been on a steady  decline  having  lost
Rs. 398.75, moving down from Rs. 2,697.50 to  Rs.  2,298.75  over
the last fortnight. HDFC is a  premier  finance  housing  finance
company and is also credited with  the  creation  of  the  retail
housing finance industry. It has the largest retail network.  The
company has widened its span of activities to encompass,  besides
its core lending business, property-related  services,  training,
consultancy and lease  finance.  It  has  also  assisted  in  the
setting up of housing finance companies in  joint  ventures  with
various banks and General Insurance Co. The company has put in an
impressive financial performance in 1995 -96 in  the  face  of  a
tough financial environment. The total income registered a 26 per
cent increase to Rs. 982.18 crores. It  was  fully  supported  by
loan approvals and disbursements which were Rs. 2,071 crores  and
Rs.  1,683  crores  respectively.  Despite  the  rocky  financial
situation, the company managed to raise deposits from  Rs.  1,853
crores to Rs. 2,513 crores which is likely to help it enlarge its
presence in both the retail and wholesale segment of the  housing
finance business.

INDIA-FAST TRACK: Apollo Tyres

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Apollo Tyres: The share price declined by Rs.  52,  shedding  Rs.
167 to Rs. 115 over the last 15 trading days.  Apollo  Tyres,  an
established player in the truck  and  bus  tyre  segment,  has  a
market share of 10.90 per cent by weight and  7.30  per  cent  in
numbers. Work on the modernisation and expansion plant at  Baroda
has been successfully  completed  and  the  benefit  of  enhanced
production will accrue to the bottomline from the  current  year.
The  modernisation  plant  at  Perambra  plant  is   also   under
implementation.  It  has  also  commissioned  a  new   plant   to
manufacture tubes and flaps with a capital cost of Rs. 32  crores
at Ranjangaon near at Pune for captive consumption. It  has  also
drawn up a detailed modernisation plan for Premier Tyres  (sought
to be revived through a BIFR revival package) at  Kalamassery  in
Kerala at a capital outlay of Rs. 8 crores. In order to meet  the
demand arising from the new generation technology  radial  tyres,
it  has  recently  entered  into  a  50:50  joint  venture   with
Continental AG of Germany to make a foray into the passenger  car
radial tyre segment at Pune. The capital outlay is expected to be
Rs. 400 crores and the initial production capacity would  be  4.7
million  passenger  car  radial  tyres  per   annum.   Commercial
production is slated to commence by mid-1998. For the year  ended
March 31, 1996, it has recorded a turnover of Rs. 1,237.69 crores
and post-tax earnings of Rs. 35.31 crores. On an equity  base  of
Rs. 29.46 crores, the EPS works out to Rs. 11.98. On the  current
market price, the stock trades at a price earnings multiple of 10
times its 1995 -96 earnings.

INDIA: Cane diversion may increase in "96-97

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

CALCUTTA:  Diversion  of   sugarcane   to   khandsari   and   gur
manufacturers during the 1996-97 sugar season is expected  to  be
larger than what it was during the 1995-96 season,  according  to
estimates. It may also lead to lower production of  sugar  during
the 1996-97 season at 155 lakh tonnes (as per industry estimates)
compared to 164.02 lakh tonnes in 1995-96. The total availability
for 1996-97 is, however, expected to be 235 lakh  tonnes  against
220 lakh tonnes in  1995-96,  largely  because  the  industry  is
overburdened on account of heavy stocks (with an aggregate  stock
of 80 lakh tonnes lying with all sugar factories) to the tune  of
Rs. 600 crores.  The  decrease  in  production  over  1995-96  is
expected to  be  11  lakh  tonnes  in  Maharashtra  (the  largest
producer), 5.8 lakh tonnes in Gujarat, 4.7 lakh tonnes in Central
UP and 4 lakh tonnes in Madhya Pradesh. Mr. O. P. Dhanuka, former
President of the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), said  the
industry, due to high production, was holding  stocks  equivalent
to 7 months' consumption. Another factor adding to the  indstry's
woes was the plunge in alcohol prices, from Rs. 28 per  litre  in
1993-94 to Rs. 4 per litre as on  date,  with  demand  still  not
picking up. This led to a huge pile-up of  molasses  stocks  with
sugar mills, which are having inventory problems, he said.

EDITORIAL: Anti-dumping blues: Major hurdle in the way of India"s exports
to Europe

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Anti-dumping action by the European Union has  the  potential  of
developing into a major hurdle in the way of India's  exports  to
Europe. Currently, as was made clear at a recent seminar  by  Mr.
Harold Wenig, head of the anti-dumping unit of the EU,  ``only  a
minuscule 0.05 per cent of Indian exports is  covered  under  the
anti-dumping provisions of the  European  Commission''.  But  the
fact remains that since the beginning of the current  year  there
has been  an  increasing  trend  of  anti-dumping  charges  being
slapped on India's exports. This has been linked  to  efforts  on
the part of the European industry trying to protect itself in the
face of WTO-regulated moves to lower trade barriers all over  the
world.

As is to be expected, it is not only European importers  who  are
moving to make the entry of cheap  imports  from  the  developing
world more difficult. In the course of  a  single  month  earlier
this  year,   the   US   International   Trade   Council   levied
countervailing duties on 15 Indian exporters of  iron  and  steel
products and anti-dumping duties on as many as 25  exporters.  In
the  case  of  the  US,  this  is  an  election   year   and   no
administration can  afford  to  alienate  the  powerful  domestic
industrial lobbies whose support is  crucial  for  a  re-election
bid. The EU has begun more than 10 investigations  against  India
alone, two of which  have  ended  with  the  imposition  of  anti
dumping  duties  on  oxalic  acid,  polyester  blended  yarn  and
polyester staple fibre. In March, reports indicated that  the  EU
had taken up  a  fresh  investigation  into  dumping  allegations
relating to grey cotton unbleached fabric against India and other
textile-exporting  countries  such  as  Pakistan,  China,  Egypt,
Turkey and Indonesia. The specific allegation made by  Eurocoton,
a European trade lobby, was that the exporters (around 265 Indian
producers are involved) were underpricing their  products  by  36
per cent resulting in a decline in the market share  of  European
textile manufacturers to 25 per cent from 33  per  cent.  Despite
the fact that an earlier investigation into  the  same  complaint
was, according to Indian officials, ``on the  verge  of  collapse
when it was withdrawn'', there is now every indication that  anti
dumping duties will  be  slapped  on  the  exporters,  the  rates
varying between 3.3 per cent and 27.5  per  cent.  In  fact,  the
Union Textiles Ministry is already reported to have taken up  the
matter with Brussels since this specific product category forms a
sizeable chunk of the country's total textile exports.

The argument that the EU should desist from slapping anti-dumping
duties of this magnitude  because  of  their  serious  impact  on
Indian exports will, of course, not be effective because Brussels
can argue, equally effectively, that it cannot allow the European
industry to be hurt by  such  cheap  imports.  The  point  is  to
convince the EU authorities that the prices of textile and  other
products currently being investigated are not  artificially  low.
This can be done only with effective legal support. Indeed,  this
need has been recognised  to  the  extent  that  a  proposal  has
already  been  made  to  the  Commerce  Ministry  (when   Mr   P.
Chidambaram was the Commerce Minister) to set  up  a  fund  which
could be utilised by exporters to challenge the levy of  punitive
duties in appropriate courts. The fund could also be used  mainly
by small and medium-size exporters to represent their case before
the EU for a reduction in the  rates  of  anti-dumping  duty  (as
reflected in the varying rates imposed on exports of grey  cotton
unbleached fabric). Such consultations  were  encouraged  by  Mr.
Wenig  at  the  New  Delhi  seminar,   his   entirely   justified
apprehension being that in the absence of such cooperation the EU
would be forced to rely on ``estimates which (are) not always  in
the best interests of the exporters''.

In short, there is nothing wrong with the  levy  of  anti-dumping
duties as such. India too has slapped similar charges  on  select
imports such as theophylline and caffeine from China.  The  point
is that the imposition should not be perceived as arbitrary,  the
latest example being the duty slapped by the  EU  on  exports  of
plastic woven sacks. The Government has an important role to play
in helping exporters in this specific sphere, a task which it has
not performed satisfactorily till now.

INDIA: Ramar claim dubbed "dishonest": Herbal fuel

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Science Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

MR. Ramar Pillai's claim of a successful  process  for  producing
`herbal fuel' has been dubbed `dishonest' by  the  Department  of
Science and Technology (DST), which ostensibly tried its best  to
help him obtain a patent and prove his method.

The DST Secretary, Dr. V. S.  Ramamurthy,  today  said  when  the
experiment at the Chennai IIT  failed  to  produce  any  fuel  on
September 26, Mr. Ramar used a hollow metallic stirrer from which
oil flowed into the boiling concoction of herbs, chemicals, etc.

The scientists carrying out the test had to stop  the  experiment
and were convinced beyond doubt that the wonder fuel  was  not  a
result of the reaction of the herbs  and  chemicals  mixing  with
water, but an external source, Dr.  Ramamurthy  explained  to  re
porters.

An extensive analysis of samples of the end product generated  by
Mr. Ramar in the demonstrations conducted at  the  Delhi  IIT  on
September 3 clearly indicated that it was a mixture of  kerosene,
diesel, gasoline and naphtha which matched with that available in
the country.

The Indian Institute of Petroleum  (IIP),  Dehradun,  Indian  Oil
Corporation's Research and Development Centre, Faridabad and  the
National Chemical Laboratory (NCL), Pune carried out  the  tests.
In fact, the IIP said the sample, with a high content of  60  per
cent kerosene, naphtha, diesel and petrol, matched with  products
manufactured using crude oil available in India.

The DST was forced to react aggressively because  Mr.  Ramar  had
not only thrown an open challenge but  had  been  accusing  scien
tists of not being fair, when in fact all-out efforts were  being
made to help him get a patent, Dr. Ramamurthy said.

"Even today, we are open if he comes back with a request to help
him scientifically. Our effort had been limited  to  helping  him
file a strong patent and, since we did not find  scientific  vali
dation for the process, we decided not to proceed further, " the
DST Secretary said.

`No political pressures':  Denying any political pressures in the
entire episode right from the beginning, the DST  Secretary  said
what had prompted him to seriously process  the  matter  was  the
claim that herbs were the source for the  petrol,  and  that  too
from the Western Ghats, and positive  certificates  had  been  re
ceived from three Chennai-based organisations.

He said the story of Mr. Ramar, as far as the DST was  concerned,
began in December 1995 when he wrote to the  Government  that  he
had discovered a herbal fuel that could run vehicles.  The  claim
was attested by three test certificates from the Chennai IIT, the
Pollution Control Board and the Chemical  Testing  Laboratory  in
Chennai.

In July, Mr. Ramar came to the DST and demonstrated his  process.
A sample of the product was then tested at  the  NCL,  Pune.  The
report said it was pure hydrocarbon. Based on  this  feedback,  a
demonstration was organised at the Delhi IIT on September 3  with
a full log kept on whatever happened.

According to Dr. Ramamurthy, in the IIT test, Mr. Ramar used 1.05
litres water, 55 gm leaves and wood, 10 gm common salt, one slice
of lemon, a pinch of ash, 1 ml of secret chemical A, a few  drops
of petrol and a small quantity of secret chemical B.

After the experiment was done in a stainless steel vessel and the
boiling matter transferred into a bucket and covered with a white
cloth, the resultant product contained 900 ml water,  400  gm  of
the herbal fuel and 110 gm of other material.

Puzzling questions:  The puzzling questions that arose were:  How
did the clear mass increase of  400  gm  in  excess  weight  come
about? How did lead, sulphur, which  are  used  in  the  refining
process, olefins -- a consequence  of  the  cracking  process  in
refinery -- find their presence in the natural crude product that
was supposedly produced?

Armed with these doubts, the DST got together a  10-member  scien
tists' team (DST-3, DRDO-2,  IOC-1,  and  IIT  Chennai-4)  and  a
patent lawyer and went to Chennai with an open mind to  help  Mr.
Ramar file a patent if he could demonstrate his  process  success
fully, Dr. Ramamurthy said. The experiment  was  conducted  using
glass equipment provided by the IIT and as directed by Mr.  Ramar
in the presence of Ms. Poonkini and her  father,  two  other  key
players in the fuel drama. Mr. Ramar, however, could not  produce
any fuel. He later told the media  in  Chennai  that  the  entire
thing was done on too short a notice and  that  his  leaves  were
contaminated.

Southern India Mills Association for strong action to avert European Union
anti-dumping duty

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Special Correspondent

COIMBATORE, Oct. 1

THE Southern India Mills Association (SIMA) has urged the  Govern
ment to caution the European Union (EU) that  any  levy  of  anti
dumping duty on grey  cotton  fabrics  from  India  would  invite
retaliatory action from it.

In a memorandum to the Union Commerce Minister, Dr. B.  B.  Ramai
ah, the SIMA Chairman, Mr. B. K. Patodia, said it was stated that
the EU was planning to slap anti-dumping levies  on  grey  cotton
fabrics imported from India. The levy ranged from 3.3 per cent to
25 per cent, the average duty being  around  17.8  per  cent.  If
levied, it may come into force from next month.

He said there was no justification for the EU to resort  to  this
step and urged the Minister to persuade the EU through  all  chan
nels to desist from its move.

Mr. Patodia pointed out that it was not as  if  the  EU  did  not
benefit from trade with India. In 1995, India  imported  430  mil
lion-ECU worth of textile machinery from the it. Airbus Industrie
was a major supplier of aircraft to Indian airlines.

He wanted the Government to send clear signals to the EU that any
unreasonable anti-dumping levy on grey cotton fabric sourced from
India would invite reciprocal action.

He also wanted the Minister to remove the ceiling on cotton  yarn
exports and to link the export of cotton yarn to  the  fulfilment
of hank yarn obligation. He said the annual quantitative  restric
tions on cotton yarn exports was based on the wrong premise  that
unlimited yarn export would hit domestic users.

While an additional 31.66 million kg of yarn  was  exported  last
year, the additional quantity supplied  within  the  country  was
136.86 million kg.

Mr. Patodia said the  hank  yarn  obligation  was  an  artificial
restriction as there was no shortage of it. In 1995-96, hank yarn
production had been put at 580 million kg but mills were  saddled
with unsold stocks.

The SIMA Chairman said the insistence  of  the  DGFT  that  mills
given EPCG licences should export cotton yarn of  counts  of  41s
and above or they should import cotton if  they  were  to  export
lower count yarn was a  retrograde  step,  which  would  hit  the
modernisation process.

He said the international demand for cotton yarn  of  counts  41s
and above was limited. In 1995-96, counts 41s  and  above  consti
tuted barely 16 per cent of the total cotton yarn  exported.  The
restriction on the counts of cotton yarn exported would deny  the
mills the facility of importing machinery availing of  concession
al duty.

He also wanted the threshold limit of Rs. 20 crores on  the  duty
free import of capital goods under the EPCG scheme to be  altered
in so far as the textile industry was concerned and  a  limit  of
Rs. 5 crores fixed.

Mr. Patodia said Bangladesh was the largest  importer  of  Indian
cotton yarn, importing to the tune of Rs. 700 crores to  Rs.  800
crores, which  were  routed  through  Petrapole.  Infrastructural
bottlenecks there had caused a delay of 30 to 60 days in clearing
the goods. Of the Rs. 250 crores sanctioned by  the  Centre  last
year to improve facilities, only Rs. 5 crores had been disbursed.

He also opposed any move to permit the  export  of  cotton  under
open general licence (OGL) as it would erode the  competitiveness
of the cotton textile industry. He said concrete  efforts  should
be made to increase the yield of cotton,  which  at  300  kg  per
hectare was one of the lowest in the world.

He urged the Centre to permit the import of viscose staple  fibre
(VSF) under OGL on a duty-free basis to check  the  price  of  in
digenously manufactured VSF. Mr. Patodia said though VSF was  the
nearest complement to cotton as a raw material and  fabrics  made
from it met the needs of the poorer sections, there were only two
indigenous producers of VSF and its price was raised frequently.

He said the import of VSF under OGL was being allowed  even  now,
but it attracted a duty of 56.21 per cent. He wanted  imports  to
be allowed on a duty-free basis, as in the case of  cotton.  This
would help the mills obtain raw materials  at  reasonable  prices
and also steady the  price of indigenously produced VSF.

Mr. Patodia said if they  were  to  remain  cost  effective,  the
garment/knitting industry had to use sophisticated machines. But,
these industries were reserved for the SSI sector with an  invest
ment cap of Rs. 60 lakhs. He suggested that in view of  the  need
for the latest technology, the investment limit be  scrapped.  De
reservation would attract large-scale industries  to  enter  this
field.

INDIA: Contest likely for top slot in Catholic Syrian Bank

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Special Correspondent

KOCHI, Oct. 1

WITH the term of the present Chairman of  Catholic  Syrian  Bank,
Mr. Alfred Solomon, drawing to a close  on  October  30,  a  keen
contest is likely for the top slot. At the recent annual  general
body meeting, the by-laws were amended for creating the post of a
part-time Chairman. Two contenders have emerged  from  among  the
existing directors.

Mr. George Chemmanur, one of the directors in the  race  for  the
top post, said several others in the board had been urging him to
throw his hat into the ring. He said that he would be a candidate
for the post.

Meanwhile, Mr. Jose Pulikken,  another  director,  told  Business
Line that the board would come out with  a  consensus  candidate,
emphasising that there would be no contest.

Being the seniormost director of the bank, Mr. Pulikken  did  not
envisage any contest from his junior colleagues on the board.  He
was optimistic that the board  would  forward  his  name  as  the
consensus candidate for the post of part-time Chairman. He evaded
questions on whether he would withdraw  his  candidature  in  the
case of a contest.

The contest for the Chairman's post will come out into  the  open
on October 1, when the Board of Directors meet  to  consider  the
names for the post. Once the Board's choice is finalised, it will
then have to be intimated to the RBI for ratification.

Though no outcome is expected at today's (Tuesday)  meeting,  the
issue is likely to exercise the minds of board members and figure
in board meetings in future.

The possibility of appointing a part-time Chairman arose once the
Banking Regulations Act was suitably amended to create the  post.
The Thrissur-based Dhanalakshmi  Bank  already  has  a  part-time
Chairman, Mr. T. S. Pattabhiraman.

Though the part-time Chairman is not entitled  to  exercise  much
executive powers, he is supposed to convene  and  coordinate  the
board meetings of the bank.

Meanwhile, the Catholic Syrian Bank is likely to remain  headless
once Mr. Solomon reverts to his parent organisation,  State  Bank
of India as Chief General Manager.

The bank is still in the process of short-listing applicants  for
the post of Managing  Director  from  among  the  respondents  to
newspaper advertisements. The respondents have to be at the level
of a Deputy General Manager in a nationalised bank. The Board  of
Directors will have to select three candidates  and  forward  the
list to the RBI for the final choice and approval.

Several directors conceded that this was a time-consuming process
and the slot was likely to be filled well after the exit  of  the
present Chairman. Even in the  event  of  a  consensus  candidate
emerging, the process of selecting a new part-time Chairman would
be delayed since the final seal of approval has to come from  the
RBI. In the interim period, when the present Chairman leaves till
a new Managing Director or a part-time Chairman is appointed, the
RBI is likely to ask a committee comprising  three  directors  to
discharge the duties of the head of the institution.

Some of the directors expressed apprehension  over  the  emerging
contest for the Chairman's post. They conceded that the  takeover
controversy in which all the existing directors played a part had
taken a toll on the fortunes of the bank. It was an arduous  task
re-building the bank from that crisis, they said.

Uncertainty continues to persist over the 39 per cent  equity  of
the bank, which had been purchased by the  Bangkok-based  Surchan
ChansriChawla. The request to transfer  the  shares  to  the  new
purchaser is still pending clearance from the RBI.

In the absence of a clear-cut  status  on  this  large  chunk  of
equity, the bank had written to the RBI stating its inability  to
abide by the stipulated capital adequacy norms.

The move to go in for a rights issue to shore up its capital  was
stalled on account of the uncertainty over the ownership of these
shares.

INDIA: Best and Crompton impasse: Mallya blames financial institutions"
"intransigence"

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by M. Ramesh

MADRAS, Oct. 1

Mr. Vijay Mallya, Chairman of the UB group, blamed  the  intransi
gence of the financial institutions for the continued impasse  in
reviving Best and Crompton Ltd.

Talking informally to this correspondent  at  the  extra-ordinary
general meeting of McDowell and Co. Ltd here  today,  Mr.  Mallya
said in just four days after the Best and Crompton AGM  (held  on
March 27, he had deposited the Rs. 5 crores with the bank  in  an
escrow account.

The rehabilitation package  was  contingent  upon  the  promoters
bringing in their initial contribution of Rs. 5  crores.  At  the
AGM, shareholders demanded an explanation as to  why  Mr.  Mallya
had not brought in the money. To which, he replied at  that  time
that any money brought in by the promoters would be taken away by
the financial institutions against the dues to them, and Best and
Crompton would not derive any benefit out of it.

"The financial institutions (ICICI) are just  not  interested",
Mr. Mallya said today. He said that within "just 96  hours"  of
the AGM, he had deposited the required  money  "in  cold  liquid
cash". He had also given a commitment in writing  that  the  pro
moters would bring in Rs.  20  crores,  once  the  rehabilitation
package is signed, he said.

"It is six months since  I  have  deposited  the  money  (Rs.  5
crores). Where is the rehabilitation package?", he asked.

Asked what were the  events  that  followed  his  depositing  the
money, Mr. Mallya  said  financial  institutions  said  that  the
company's building on Cenatoph Road (in Madras) would have to  be
sold. For this, there were several  permissions  to  be  obtained
from the State Government. Besides,  the  financial  institutions
wanted the Rs. 20 crores to be also deposited before the  rehabil
itation package was finalised.

"I am fed up with the whole thing", Mr.  Mallya  said.  "Every
body is blaming me for what happened, but Best and Crompton is  a
100-year old company", he said, implying that  the  reasons  for
its being in a shambles were historical.

At the Best and Crompton's AGM, Mr. Mallya had said that when  he
took over the company, he was  misled  by  the  fudged  accounts.
Therefore, he had not realised the extent to  which  the  company
had gone down. When he attended the first board meeting  of  Best
and Crompton (as soon as the UB group took it over) in  1989,  he
was forced to approve the transfer of funds from the reserves  to
the profit and loss account so that  the  company  could  show  a
profit and pay a 10 per cent dividend. Further, no provision  was
made for liabilities of Rs. 30 crores, which was against  account
ing norms, he told the shareholders, in front of Mr.  V.  Sriniva
san, senior partner, Fraser and Ross, which is the auditor of the
company.

He was equally unhappy with the way things were proceeding in the
matter of Mangalore Chemicals and  Fertilisers  Ltd  (MCF).  Here
again, Mr. Mallya  blamed  the  financial  institutions  for  not
agreeing to any meaningful rehabilitation package.

Indian Statistical Institute to conduct survey on co.s awarded ISO
certification

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Principal Correspondent

CALCUTTA, Oct. 1

THE Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) has decided to  conduct  a
national survey of the 1,260 companies which  have  been  awarded
the International Standards Organisation (ISO) certification.

The exercise was to be carried  out  from  Bangalore,  under  the
leadership of Mr. U. H. Acharya and Mr. Sanjit Ray, senior  advis
ers to the statistical quality control  and  operations  research
division of the ISI.

The head of the SQC and OR  division,  Professor  Anup  Majumdar,
told Business Line that the exercise was to find  whether,  since
the rush for the ISO 9000 certification began  fours  years  ago,
the Indian industry had really achieved a improvement in  quality
or was it just a status symbol that had remained on paper.

"We also want to evaluate the degree of competitive  edge  which
the certified companies have been able to gain for themselves, "
he said.

"We plan to assimilate  through  an  independent  analysis,  the
experiences of the big, small,  private  and  the  public  sector
companies which went through the certification process, "  Prof.
Majumdar said, adding that the exercise to be  conducted  through
client contacts, personal interviews and  questionnaires  to  the
ISO companies, had already been launched on  an  informal  basis.
The entire exercise was expected to be completed in three months.

Pointing out that the three year validity period of  the  certifi
cates would now have matured for around 100  companies,  he  said
the survey would also reveal whether the corporates had opted for
decertification or had in any way lost their certification due to
non-compliance.

Referring to the UK experience in this regard, he  said  the  ISO
9000 family of certifications had more followers in the  UK  than
in any other country, even as uncertainty remained about the real
benefits from certification.

An in-depth survey of British  companies,  however,  showed  that
only those which saw certification as an integral part  of  their
management strategies were able to push the quality benchmark  to
the full extent of its possibilities.

Stressing that certification did reward investment, he said  this
was borne out by almost  12,000  UK-based  businesses  which  had
opted for ISO 900  certification.  Their  sales  were  more  than
double the UK average between  1993-94  and  1994-95,  and  these
companies were four times more likely to have survived the recent
recession. Certified companies had a failure rate of 1.1 per cent
a year, compared with the national average of 5.2 per cent.

INDIA: Iomega unruffled by LS-120 drive entry

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Arun Natarajan

MADRAS, Oct. 1

IOMEGA Corp.,  the  US-based  maker  of  removable  data  storage
products, has dismissed any threat to its best-selling Zip  drive
from the recent entry of  the  LS-120  drive.  According  to  the
company's Senior Vice President (Europe),  Mr.  Srini  Nageshwar,
the technological superiority of the Zip drive  and  its  one-and
half year lead over the new product  will  ensure  its  continued
success over its competition.

The LS-120 has emerged as a potential threat to  the  Zip  drive,
with the world's leading PC maker, Compaq  Computers,  announcing
that it will include the LS-120 `flopptical' drive in  select  PC
models. Mr. Nageshwar, however, downplayed  the  significance  of
Compaq's move and said  the  Zip  continued  to  receive  growing
support from the rest of the industry.

"In any other industry, the  market  leader  commands  something
like 30 to 40 per cent of the market, and has a lot of clout.  In
the PC industry, however, where  the  leading  players  typically
have 10 to 15 per cent share, the influence of  just  one  player
like Compaq is not as important, " he said in an interview.

The LS-120 disks can store 120 MB of data, as against the 100  MB
capacity of the Zip disks. Mr. Nageshwar said though it would  be
"quite simple" for Iomega to increase the capacity of the  Zip,
the 20 MB difference would not warrant a change.

While the Zip drive uses a purely magnetic technology to read and
write data, the LS-120, which was developed jointly by 3M,  Matsu
shita and Compaq, uses a  combination  of  optical  and  magnetic
technology. (The `LS' in LS-120 stands  for  `laser-servo'  mecha
nism). While optical storage techniques -- like those used in  CD
drives -- provide higher storage capacities, the per  unit  costs
of optical media are much higher than those of  magnetic  storage
products. The flopptical technology attempts to  incorporate  the
best of both.

"We considered the use of a 21 MB  flopptical  as  far  back  as
1990. While in terms of performance it was slightly  faster  than
the floppy disk, the cost did not come down to  less  than  $100.
Companies like IBM and other  PC  makers  said  the  cost  should
approach something like $50. That is why we  decided  to  abandon
the flopptical technology, " Mr. Nageshwar said. While the costs
of the LS-120 and Zip drives are approximately the  same  ($200),
the LS-120 disks are expected to  cost  thrice  as  much  as  Zip
disks.

"In fact -- and this is not very well known -- it is we who sold
the flopptical to 3M and Matsushita. And it was some of our  guys
who moved to those  companies,  who  developed  it  further.  The
specifications (of the LS-120) are in fact still almost the same,
" he added.

The LS-120 enjoys an edge in the fact that  it  provides  compati
bility with the  currently  used  3.5-inch  (1.44  MB)  floppies.
Iomega is, however, confident that the  Zip  will  soon  overcome
even this handicap.

Mr. Nageshwar said the company closely analysed the importance of
compatibility before deciding to go ahead with a new format.  For
support, he pointed to the example of how the 3.5-inch floppy has
almost completely replaced its predecessor, the 5.25-inch  floppy
despite the incompatibility of their drives.

Since it began shipping in March last year,  Iomega's  Zip  drive
has become one of the hottest-selling data storage products.  The
company has sold more than two million drives in  a  little  more
than one year. It also sold about 10 million Zip disks. In  fact,
last year, it could not meet demand and has  since  licensed  out
the manufacture of drives and disks.

Iomega says the Zip  is  more  user-friendly.  According  to  Mr.
Nageshwar, the drive was created after a lot of  market  research
to identify user requirements and the problems  they  face  while
using existing storage devices. It comes with a  built-in  backup
system and the `Zip Tools' software,  which  makes  it  easy  for
users to manage, share and save data.

Iomega claims increasing  support  from  major  PC  and  consumer
electronics companies. The list includes IBM, HP,  Unisys,  Power
Computing, Micron Electronics, Acer, Packard Bell  and  NEC.  The
Zip is also supported by several of the world's leading drive and
media manufacturers, including TDK, Fuji, Sony, Maxell, and Seiko
Epson.

Recently Acer Corp. chose the Zip drive as the storage device for
its `AcerBasic' line of low-cost PCs. Also, Bandai Digital  Equip
ment Corp., one of the  licensees  for  Apple  Computer's  Pippin
Internet and gaming terminal, has announced that it will make the
Zip drive an option for its product.

Iomega's other storage products include the 1-gigabyte (GB) `Jaz'
drives and disks, the `Ditto' tape backup drives and  cartridges,
and the `Bernoulli' line of removable  drives  and  disks.  These
products are targeted at home and business PC  users.  The  educa
tion and  the  creative  professionals  (animators  and  graphics
specialists) segments were especially important to  the  company,
Mr. Nageshwar said.

Iomega has nearly 2,000 employees at its offices  worldwide.  The
company's products are available in India through TVSE's  Indmark
Infocom division.

The Zip drive was introduced in India two months ago.  The  drive
is priced at Rs. 11,500 and the disks at Rs. 1,200. Mr. Nageshwar
said the late launch here was primarily due to Iomega's inability
to provide enough units to countries  outside  the  Americas  and
Europe. He said the entire range  of  Iomega  products  would  be
available in India by the first quarter of 1997.

Mr. Nageshwar, who heads Iomega's European operations from  Germa
ny, also oversees the Indian market. Hailing from Tamil Nadu,  he
had a long stint at HP in the US before joining Iomega. While  at
HP, he was also involved in the development of the standards  for
the 3.5-inch floppy drive.

INDIA: National Thermal Power Corp posts record sales despite outstandings

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

Our Senior Correspondent

NEW DELHI, Oct. 1

NATIONAL Thermal  Power  Corporation  Ltd  (NTPC),  has  reported
record sales of Rs. 8,387 crores during  1995-96  despite  having
outstandings in excess of Rs. 4,955 crores owed  to  the  corpora
tion by various agencies.

Addressing a press conference, the  NTPC  Chairman  and  Managing
Director, Mr. Rajendra Singh, said that the World  Bank  had  cau
tioned NTPC to take steps to recover its outstandings or the Bank
would stop the sanction of future loans.

He added that total dues, which stood at Rs. 4,047.96  crores  on
March 1996, increased to Rs.  4,944.4  crores  till  the  end  of
August, which is about 4.2 months of billing.

"This is against the World Bank norm  of  two  months.  We  have
geared our commercial activities and power supply  was  regulated
to major defaulters which include the State electricity boards of
Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. When  the  Railways
do not allow people to travel without tickets, why should we keep
on providing electricity without payment?" Mr. Singh asked.

Among the States which owed huge amounts to NTPC  include  Delhi,
which owes the corporation Rs. 743.89  crores,  UP  with  an  out
standing of Rs. 1,006.5 crores, Bihar Rs.  533.63  crores,  Jammu
and Kashmir Rs. 334.02 crores, Rajasthan Rs. 353.45 crores,  West
Bengal Rs. 186.85 crores and Maharashtra Rs. 239.37  crores.  Mr.
Singh added that the corporation was facing  less  problems  from
the States of the southern and western India.

He said that the corporation had entered into a tripartite  agree
ment with the Haryana electricity board for non-payment of  dues.
"The agreement which is legally binding  will  ensure  that  the
Reserve Bank of India pays us in case the SEB defaults."

However, despite such setbacks NTPC has been able to  register  a
net profit of Rs. 1,352.61 crores and has declared a dividend  of
Rs. 195 crores for the financial year 1995-96, up  from  Rs.  130
crores paid as dividend  last  year.  The  corporation  generated
93,155 million units of electricity at a  plant  load  factor  of
78.80 per cent, Mr. Singh said. He added that  the  total  commer
cial realisation during the year was 84.54 per cent amounting  to
Rs. 7,171.59 crores.

During the year, NTPC commissioned an additional capacity of  710
MW by synchronising one 500 MW unit in Talcher, Orissa,  and  one
unit of 210 MW in Kahalgaon, Bihar. Besides, the corporation also
acquired 460 MW of Talcher Thermal Power station  of  the  Orissa
State Electricity Board. "The total installed  capacity  of  the
corporation rose to 16,795 MW on  March  31,  1996,"  Mr.  Singh
said.

He added that during 1995-96, NTPC generated 93,155  MU  of  elec
tricity and contributed more than  31  per  cent  of  the  entire
thermal generation and 24.6 per cent of the total  generation  in
the country. "The availability factor  of  NTPC  coal-based  sta
tions for the year was 85.32 per cent, " he said.

He added that the corporation's total approved investment  up  to
March 1996 was Rs. 27,873.28 crores corresponding to an  approved
capacity of 19,115 MW.

Turning his attention to external assistance, Mr. Singh said that
work on the second stage of Unchahar project had  commenced  with
an assistance of $ 160 millions from the Asian Development  Bank.
He added that the Japanese  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund
(OECF) had agreed to give a financial assistance  of  19.817  bil
lion Yen for the proposed 1,000 MW coal-based  project  in  Simha
dri, Andhra Pradesh.

INDIA: Pradeshiya Industrial & Investment Corporation of UP taking tips
from ground realities

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Rabindra Nath Sinha

LUCKNOW, Oct. 1

THE Pradeshiya Industrial &  Investment  Corporation  of  UP  Ltd
(PICUP), which is among the top three promotional agencies in the
country, has sought to strike a balance between  its  promotional
role and the ground realities in the capital and money markets.

With bank and institutional  funds  costly,  the  capital  market
showing no signs of a sustained pick-up and ICD rates fluctuating
on the higher side, the PICUP top brass found some deviation from
usual practices unavoidable if it were to ensure  that  its  rela
tively cheap funds were  effectively  utilised  for  the  State's
industrialisation.

Thus, in its fine-tuned scheme of things, term-lending, equipment
refinance and equipment finance have been  accorded  the  highest
priority, which, in turn, means drastically  reduced  commitments
for short-term loans. Also, PICUP has taken the view that working
capital must be the responsibility of commercial banks.

Finally, PICUP, considering ground realities, has  chosen  to  de
emphasise the joint sector concept. As it is,  entrepreneurs  are
not showing much interest in the joint  sector  concept.  On  its
part, PICUP has lost interest as subsequent disinvestment  hardly
ever takes place and, therefore, the  objective  of  re-deploying
funds in the equity of new ventures is  not  realised.  Moreover,
disinvestment in the  present  depressed  state  of  the  capital
market is ruled out.

PICUP has also minimised the earlier practice of back-loading  as
a result of which bulk of the disbursals used to be made  in  the
last four months of project implementation. A strategy of  evenly
spread disbursals is already in place to the benefit of  entrepre
neurs who, in the prevailing circumstances, are finding it  tough
to raise funds from the capital market.

The PICUP Chairman, Mr. Brijendra Sahay, and the  Managing  Direc
tor, Mr. Atul Chaturvedi, are optimistic  that  despite  the  pre
vailing political uncertainties, 1996-97 will prove to be another
successful year for the organisation "which  has  been  able  to
earn the confidence of entrepreneurs because of its  professional
ism and expertise in  project  formulation  and  appraisal".  It
enjoys `A' rating of IDBI and SIDBI, they point out with a  sense
of satisfaction.

Against the targeted Rs. 185 crores for 1996-97, sanctions in the
six months to September are placed  at  around  Rs.  134  crores,
which is 90 per cent higher on Rs. 72 crores for the  first  half
of 1995-96. Disbursements between April and September are  placed
at Rs. 64 crores, against Rs. 63 crores for the  same  period  of
1995-96. The mismatch, according to Mr.  Chaturvedi,  is  due  to
fact that this year  August  and  September  accounted  for  many
sanctions. PICUP's MD feels sanctions for the  current  financial
year may exceed the target if buoyancy  returns  to  the  capital
market.

Recoveries at around 85 per cent of the target should  be  consid
ered "good", says Mr. Chaturvedi. NPA,  at  9.92  per  cent  in
1995-96, was lower on 9.99 per cent of 1994-95 and the aim is  to
bring it down to around nine per cent at the end of  the  current
financial year. PICUP makes 100 per cent provision  against  NPA,
he points out.

According to estimates, its net profit in 1995-96  stood  at  Rs.
2.87 crores. The net profit for 1994-95 was higher  at  Rs.  5.54
crores. A pronounced downtrend in its merchant  banking  activity
during the whole of 1995-96 is a major factor to cause a  dip  in
the net profit. For the  current  financial  year,  expecting  an
improvement in the  overall  situation,  PICUP  has  projected  a
substantially higher profit of around Rs.  10  crores.  "We  fer
vently hope buoyancy will return to the capital  market  and  our
merchant banking activity will pick up, " says PICUP's MD.

An overwhelming majority of the proposals that it  receives  from
entrepreneurs are for setting up units in western and central UP.
The western UP areas -- Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater  Noida,  Meerut
-- contiguous to New Delhi are  naturally  the  investors'  first
preference because  of  excellent  communication  facilities  and
proximity to markets. Central UP is the next choice of investors;
a good number of units are already there and more are  likely  to
come up. Of the new proposals received and being processed by the
organisation, many are for setting up units for auto  components,
steel fabrication, castings, bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals.

In eastern UP, sugar and by-products continue to be the  mainstay
of the economy. PICUP hardly receives any investment proposal  of
the kind it gets for western and central UP. Mr. Sahay says  that
efforts are being made  to  generate  investments  in  agro-based
industries including food processing units.

While time alone will show to what extent the  efforts  have  suc
ceeded, it is clear that in eastern UP, further breakthrough will
be possible only with integrated sugar  complexes  having  within
their purview paper making facility, distillery, chemicals  units
and cogeneration of power.

The success of PICUP in its rather limited sphere  does  not  war
rant an inference that UP is set to emerge industrially stronger.
Because of political instability and socio-political tensions  in
the past five years, the State could not derive benefits from the
liberalisation process, despite the fact that its incentives  for
new industries compare  favourably  with  those  offered  by  the
industrially-advanced States of Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Much will hinge on the outcome of the ongoing electoral  process.
The State's industrialisation prospects will certainly look up if
the electoral process paves the way for political stability.

INDIA: Chennai housing property still dear

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Deeptha Rajkumar

CHENNAI, Oct. 1

WHILE commercial property prices in Chennai have  plateaued  over
the past 5-6 months after a distinct fall, the prices of  residen
tial property in the city, though not exactly  untouched  by  the
slide, continue to rule high.

Builders, promoters and surveyors alike  insist  that  there  has
been no great slide in residential property prices in  the  city.
There are instances where residential properties within the  city
and even in the suburbs have defied the trend.

Of late, with a burgeoning middle class, there  has  been  a  con
scious shift on the part  of  reputed  builders  to  exploit  the
hitherto untapped potential in the suburbs. As such,  the  market
only anticipates an increase in the supply of housing stock.

While conceding that land value in Chennai has  appreciated,  Mr.
C. H. Gopinatha Rao, a valuer, however, feels that it is  more  a
seller's market. The rules and regulations are more in favour  of
the promoter.

According to Mr. P. Viswanathan, president, Sanmar Properties and
Investment Ltd, the residential property market  is  dictated  by
peripheral sentiment. His argument is that any difference can  be
attributed to the attitude of the end-user. "I conceive the real
estate market as a standard industrial product. As such, I market
a unit apartment as an industrial and emotional product. You  may
buy it as a perception product."

Mr. Ravikumar, General Manager, Chaitanya  Builders  and  Leasing
Pvt. Ltd, agrees that the effect is not so much in terms of money
as in terms of perception. He is of the  view  that  there  is  a
"tendency of late on the part of the end-user  to  postpone  his
decision".

Mr. Viswanathan said, "There is  a  difference  today  in  that,
deals which six months ago would have  been  concluded  within  a
week are taking longer to transact and  at  a  slower  pace.  But
there are transactions taking  place  and  not  at  lower  quotes
either." A tight money market,  a  dull  stock  market  and  the
effects of other financial sectors, are factors that  go  towards
slowing the pace.

Flats in Tambaram and Velachery quote at Rs. 800-1,200 a sq.  ft.
and in Mogappair around Rs. 1,100 a sq. ft. Flats in  residential
areas like Mylapore and T. Nagar go  for  upwards  of  Rs.  2,500
2,900 a sq. ft. and in areas such as Chamiers Road, Landons  Road
and Victoria Crescent, anywhere between Rs. 3,000-3,500 a sq. ft.

One reason for the comparative stability is the fact that Chennai
is predominantly an end-users' market, where in most  cases  hous
ing is an investment for life rather  than  for  speculative  pur
poses. Hence, the degree of  volatility  witnessed  elsewhere  is
absent.

Reiterating this factor is Alacrity Housing Ltd, which says  that
it is into housing as a basic need and not into real  estate  per
se. With ongoing projects in the city as well as in the  suburbs,
the company claims to have remained  untouched  by  the  apparent
lull. The company, which has branched out into the suburbs, feels
that there is a substantial market for housing there. Sales,  the
company asserts, have in no way gone down.

Mr. Navratan Lunawat, Chairman  and  Managing  Director,  Arihant
Foundations and Housing Ltd, is of the opinion  that  residential
property prices have gone up. In its  forthcoming  projects,  the
company has targeted the upper segment of the residential  proper
ty market. He reiterates that sales were never  a  problem.  "It
all depends on the credibility and repute of the builder."

Another point of view is that the lull in the real estate  market
today is more a process of  technical  correction  than  anything
else. What follows is swift reassurance that  given  the  current
scenario in the residential property market, neither the end-user
nor the long-term investor need worry. Only those  in  for  quick
returns may be affected.

Sources in the industry maintain that for the real estate  market
in the city to recoup its former gloss, it  could  take  anywhere
from nine to 12 months. Meanwhile, builders continue to look  for
customers. There are hoardings across the city  advertising  easy
credit. And the response to advertisements shows that not only is
the broker network active, the enthusiasm of  the  landowner  too
has not flagged.

INDIA: New rubber tapping system

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by Aravindan

UNLIKE most plantation crops, harvesting is a complicated process
in rubber. Latex is obtained from the  bark  of  the  tree  by  a
process of `controlled-wounding' when the shavings  of  bark  are
removed.

The response to different tapping systems varies from  one  clone
to another. In general, budded trees are to  be  tapped  on  half
spiral alternate daily (1/2Sd/2) system  and  seedlings  on  half
spiral third daily (1/2Sd/3) system. There are, however,  certain
clones such as RRII 105, PB 235 and PB 28/59 which are  prone  to
tapping panel dryness under alternate daily system.

To ward off the incidence of panel dryness, it is recommended  to
adopt d/3 tapping system where a high incidence of panel  dryness
is encountered. It is preferable to resort to d/3 system at  BO-1
and BO-2 stages if high incidence of dry trees is encountered  in
new high-yielding clones. Daily tapping will  lead  to  increased
incidence of panel dryness.

For high-yielding varieties d/3 systems  can  be  adopted  during
tapping on the virgin bark. Though the yield per hectare  may  be
less during the initial period, the return  per  tapper  will  be
higher. The difference between d/2 and d/3  system  will  be  nar
rowed in due course and there will be saving in  the  cost  under
d/3 system.

The yield from trees varies with clone, age of tree, fertility of
soil, climatic conditions, tapping system followed and  skill  of
the tapper.

Intensive tapping is generally done on old rubber trees for a few
years prior to their removal. The methods  of  intensive  tapping
depend on the  condition  of  trees,  previous  tapping  systems,
availability of bark and the period  available  for  exploitation
before felling.

When tapping of renewed bark on basal panels becomes  uneconomic,
new cuts are opened at higher levels, 180 cm from  bud  union  or
even higher. The tapper uses a small ladder  to  reach  the  cut.
Since ladder tapping is more  strenuous  and  time-consuming,  re
duced tapping tasks are done.

Controlled upward tapping (CUT) is of recent origin.  It  can  be
practiced for longer exploitation of the virgin  bark  above  the
base panel. In the CUT system, instead of using a ladder, a  long
handled modified gouge knife is used for upward tapping from  the
ground and bark consumption is minimised.  Higher  yield  can  be
obtained as there is no bark island effect.

In the CUT system, monthly bark consumption is about  3-4  cm  in
the lower half of the panel and 4-5 cm in  the  upper  half.  The
support cut may be cleaned 3-4 times a  month  to  prevent  spill
over. Since it is difficult to rainguard the panel it is  advised
to rest the panel during the  rainy  season.  With  tapping  rest
during rainy season, one panel can be tapped for  more  than  two
years. Efforts are on to evaluate methods to tap the  high  panel
during rainy season.

Special training is required to use the modified gouge knife  and
to tap without raising the hands  above  the  shoulder.  As  rain
guarding is not a normal practice in  Kanyakumari  district,  CUT
can be practised by small growers and estates. About 50 per  cent
increase in yield can be achieved by adopting this method.

Trees can be puncture-tapped when they attain 40-45 cm girth  one
year before normal opening of the tree. But, this  is  restricted
to large estates on an observational basis.

INDIA: Campco to make, sell arecanut products

from BUSINESS LINE (The Hindu), 2 October 1996

by R. Mohan

MANGALORE, Oct. 1

THE buzz word at the Rs. 175-crore Campco, Mangalore is to  diver
sify. The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing  Co
operative Ltd, has wiped off its modest losses and emerged with a
profit of Rs. 1 crore in 1995-96.

"The figures are yet being audited.  We  will  improve  our  net
profits this year again, " Mr. K. Ram Bhat, Chairman  of  Campco
said. Talking to Business Line,  he said it had  already  decided
to reintroduce Campco chocolates in the market as early as  possi
ble.

At present, the Rs.  20-crore  chocolate  manufacturing  unit  at
Puttur is utilised by Nestle. This agreement will end in 2000 and
attractive terms are offered to Campco to let it out on lease for
30 years. However, Campco now wants to go it alone.

The aim of Campco is to ensure a fair price for arecanut  farmers
in Karnataka and Kerala. It  has  been  holding  the  price  line
favourably since 1990. It had bought 25,000  tonnes  of  arecanut
from farmers last year and this year the target was three  lakhs,
he said.

There are 64,000 farmer members of Campco in Karnataka  and  Kera
la, 465 co-operative members and 129 branches all over  the  coun
try. Though Campco's market share is only about 15 per  cent,  it
influences the market price.

One of the diversification is to make baskets and trays through a
technology developed by the Central Food  Technological  Research
Institute (CFTRI) in Mysore. The other is  to  sell  arecanut  in
small pouches of different sizes.

Mr. Pramod Kumar Rai, Managing Director of Campco, said  the  Rs.
50-lakh facility to produce such pouches was  ready  at  Yeyyadi,
near Mangalore. Trial production had commenced and Campco  expect
ed a good domestic market and demand in places such as  Singapore
and the Gulf countries, he said.

About 68,000 ha producing 1,00,000 tonnes is  under  arecanut  in
Karnataka and 69,000 ha in Kerala producing 80,000 tonnes. Campco
has already signed a tripartite agreement with the CFTRI and  the
Next Paradigm in Singapore to manufacture and sell articles  such
as baskets and trays from the arecanut  sheath  and  leaves.  The
supari pouches will  be  of  scented  and  non-scented  varieties
priced between Re. 1 and Rs.  1.50,  according  to  current  esti
mates, Mr. Rai said.

For years it was manufacturing `Winner' comparable to  Bournvita.
"From this year onwards we want to repackage it  and  market  it
aggressively, " Mr. Rai said.

The co-operative approach has helped tackle  pests  and  diseases
which affected Indian cash crops. The latest  is  the  `Kole'  or
`Mahale' disease, which has affected arecanut  trees  in  Puttur,
Sullia and Bantwal areas.

Mr. Ram Bhat and Mr. Rai were confident of tackling this  disease
and have decided to set up a research and development  unit.  The
endosulfan pesticide used killed  the  milibug  and  its  natural
predator. Further research will concentrate on a cure that  would
spare the natural predator of these ant-like pests.

Campco has invited experts from the Bangalore-based University of
Agricultural Sciences, Horticultural Department  and  Plantations
Research Institute to tackle the disease which has affected about
50 acres this year.
