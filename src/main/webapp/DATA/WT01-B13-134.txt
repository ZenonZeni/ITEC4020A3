<P>

The poor performance of the U.S. bond market since the decision of the Federal Open Market Committee to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged at its late August meeting reflects growing investor apprehension about the strength of the U.S. economy.  The low level of unemployment claims, the buoyancy of the equity market, and anecdotal evidence of resilient retail sales suggest that the economy is continuing to expand at an annual rate of at least 3.0%.  Such a number is not alarming by historical standards, but it is troublesome for the financial markets when it occurs against a backdrop of only 5.5% unemployment and widespread business concern about labor scarcity.  There is also increasing evidence that the government's GDP accounts may be underestimating the economy's true growth rate.  During the past year, real personal and business incomes have expanded at a rate about 1.0% higher than official measures of real output.  As the government's estimates of income and output are supposed to converge over time, it appears increasingly likely that the government's new system of GDP measurement is underestimating the economy's true growth rate.
<P>
There is evidence that the Federal Reserve is deeply divided about the inflation risks in the U.S. economy.  District presidents from the middle west have become increasingly vociferous about the danger of low unemployment pushing up wages and reviving inflationary psychology, but the new Clinton appointees to the FOMC have been reluctant to raise interest rates only a few months after their appointments.  As the Clinton appointees are mainstream economists who understand the inflation risks poised by high levels of resource utilization, it is doubtful that they will oppose monetary tightening if unemployment declines further this autumn.  But the delays in Fed tightening could still set the stage for a sharp rise in bond yields because of market concern about the Fed pursuing too passive a monetary strategy in the run-up to the presidential election.   A sharp rise in bond yields will probably also depress the equity market and provide the Dole campaign with an opportunity to raise questions about the economic outlook for 1997.
<P>
The evidence of the economy enjoying above trend growth is widespread.  The level of unemployment claims has dropped to a six year low.  The Manpower Employment survey is projecting expanded hiring activity during the fourth quarter.  Retailers are experiencing good back to school sales.  The level of capital goods orders, excluding the aircraft and defense sectors, rose to $127.8 billion during July from $125 billion during June and the second quarter average was $123.8 billion.  The July Dun and Bradstreet survey of business expectations is projecting healthy gains in both orders and production.  The production index rose to 43 from 37 in June while the order index shot up to 46 from 40 in June.  Most measures of consumer confidence are also very upbeat.  In fact, the University of  Michigan survey of consumer perceptions of government economic policy during July showed that for the first time in the history of the Clinton administration as many people now think that government policy is good (22%) as think it is poor (22%).  The Michigan index of the overall approval rating of government policy is also at 100 compared to 50-60 during late 1992 and a previous peak of 118 during the mid-1980's.
<P>
Some of the sectors which boosted output growth during the second quarter are losing momentum.  The auto industry is projecting unit sales of only 15.3 million during the second half of 1996 compared to 15.6 million during the first half. Home sales should soon respond to the uptick which occurred in mortgage rates during the spring.  As a result, residential construction activity will slow compared to annualized rates of gain of 15.1% during the second quarter and 7.4% during the first quarter.
<P>
It also is unclear how large a contribution inventory will make to the economy's third quarter growth rate.  The level of non-farm inventory accumulation shot up to $11.9 billion at annual rates during the second quarter from $2.9 billion during the first quarter and $19.0 billion during the fourth quarter of last year.  In June, it appeared that the auto industry would attempt to boost inventories during the third quarter in order to compensate for the risk of a strike during September, but the purchasing agent survey for July showed no evidence of an inventory build-up.  As inventory levels are satisfactory in most industries, inventories will not be a drag on third quarter output growth but their contribution could be quite modest compared to the second quarter.
<P>
The August Blue Chip survey of the economic consensus indicates that most American forecasters expect output growth to slow sharply by the fourth quarter.  In early August, the median forecast projected, 2.6% output growth during the third quarter, 2.1% during the fourth quarter, and 1.9% during the first quarter of 1997.  The ten most optimistic forecasters projected 3.3% growth during the third quarter and 2.9% during the fourth quarter.  The most pessimistic expected growth of only 1.8% and 1.1% during the final two quarters of 1996.
