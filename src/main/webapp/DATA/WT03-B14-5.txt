SW BELL GETS APPROVAL OF FIVE-YEAR `TELEKANSAS' REGULATION PLAN

Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. closed out 1989 with another
notch in its belt, as far as state alternative regulatory
plan approvals go.  The Kansas Corporation Commission on Dec.
29 unanimously approved the company's five-year "TeleKansas"
plan (TW, June 12), as modified by a settlement agreement
reached early in November between the telco and commission
staff.  The text of the commission's ruling should be released
by the end of January, according to an agency spokesman.

Earlier, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved a
three-year experimental regulatory plan negotiated between
PSC staff, Southwestern Bell, and the Office of Public Counsel
(TW, Oct. 2).

The Texas Public Utility Commission is scheduled to begin
hearings on Southwestern Bell's "Texas First" plan on Jan.
22.  A company spokeswoman said that proceeding is not subject
to a statutory time limit.  She noted that the number of
witnesses scheduled to participate could push the hearings
alone, "in a worst case scenario," into six months.

In the Texas proceeding, PUC staff also has proposed that
Southwestern Bell's revenues be reduced by $392,000,000 (TW,
Nov. 13).  The company's Texas First proposal would reduce
its revenues by $72,000,000 annually (TW, Jan. 16).

Under the alternative regulatory plan approved in Kansas,
basic local rates for business and residential customers will
remain at current levels for five years.  These rates will not
be adjusted, as the company had originally proposed, by a
Consumer Price Index/productivity measurement mechanism.
Over the five-year period, the company will make rate
reductions totaling $110,700,000 for toll, intrastate/interLATA
access charges, Touch-Tone, residential service connection
charges, and other services.

The company also will undertake a network modernization program
with an estimated value of $160,000,000 over five years.
Under the program, Southwestern Bell will upgrade all 131 of
its remaining electromechanical switching offices to digital
capability.  The telco also will be permitted flexible pricing
on certain services, such as billing and collection, directory
services, MicroLink I and II (packet switched), Plexar I and
II (Centrex-like), and custom calling.  Instead of the usual
30 days, Southwestern Bell may file rate changes for these
services subject to commission approval in 20 days.  The
commission still could act within the 20-day limit to suspend
rates for the full 240-day period, according to the approved
plan.

The commission also ruled that while the plan is in place,
neither Southwestern Bell nor commission staff will seek to
alter the rates or earnings of the company.  During this
period, other alternative regulatory plans will be explored
and evaluated, it said, noting that it is "not the intention"
to "return to rate base regulation at the end of the five
years."

In the first year of the plan, a $2,000,000 cut in access
charges and a $17,100,000 reduction in intraLATA toll rates
would take effect.  A "1+ Saver" discount plan for  large
businesses would be introduced in the plan's third year.
While Touch-Tone rates would be reduced by 25 cents in the
first year and basic "911" service would be offered free, the
TeleKansas plan also includes rate increases for directory
assistance and rotary hunt services.  Throughout the duration
of the plan, Southwestern Bell will fund dual-party relay
service, offsets for losses on Southwestern Bell toll routes
relating to Optional Community Calling Plans, and an assistance
plan for local service rates.  Residential service connections
charges will drop from $44.15 to $39, and to $36 if the move
is within the same service area.

PACIFIC TELESIS PLANS TO CUT 11,000 JOBS IN FIVE-YEAR EARLY
RETIREMENT, ATTRITION PLAN

Pacific Telesis Group last week announced plans to trim its
management and non-management employee ranks by 11,000 during
the next five years through "early retirement offerings, out-
placement programs, and attrition."  Pacific Telesis currently
employs fewer than 69,000 persons.  Of that number, 64,000
work for Pacific Bell, the group's main operations affiliate.

Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, Pacific
Bell's work force has been reduced by 21% or about 17,000
employees, the company said.  Together with increased operating
efficiencies and growth in the California market, the
downsizing has led to telephone rate reductions of more than
$1 billion since the Bell System breakup, Pacific Telesis said.

Pacific Telesis Chairman Sam Ginn said the force reductions
will occur primarily in Pacific Bell, where about 7600 non-
salaried and 3400 management positions are to be eliminated.
Another 50 positions among the holding company staff will be
cut.  Mr. Ginn noted that Nevada Bell, the group's smaller
telco operating company, recently completed an early retirement
offering that trimmed management ranks by 33%.  Pacific Telesis
said it expects the downsizing to reduce labor costs
substantially over five years and does not expect the costs
of implementing the force reductions to affect net income
significantly.

The company said its early retirement plan will be a permanent
change to existing pension plans for eligible employees in
selected organizations.  Credit for an additional three years'
service with the company and three years of age will be offered
in "selected organizations" within Pacific Bell and the holding
company staff.  The company said employees would be given
details of the offering within a week of the Jan. 4
announcement.  In addition, Pacific Bell managers whose jobs
are identified as surplus but who are not eligible for the
early retirement offering will be given the option of accepting
retraining for other positions within the corporation,
accepting downgrades to other positions, or accepting an "exit
package," Pacific Telesis said.

It said the elimination of 50 jobs at the holding company
level is expected to be completed this year.  The downsizing
effort will include the early retirement offer, retraining,
downgrades, and an out-placement package for eligible
employees.  Surplus holding company-level employees will be
given full consideration for job openings in subsidiaries,
the company added.  The force reduction program will not affect
the group's diversified companies, which include PacTel
Cellular, PacTel Paging, Pacific Telesis International, PacTel
Business Systems, and PacTel Properties.

MARKEY URGES CONSUMERS TO GET INVOLVED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS
POLICY LEGISLATIVE EFFORT

House telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Edward J. Markey
(D., Mass.) is preparing to act on telecommunications policy,
he has told consumer representatives after meeting with a
diverse group for and against Bell operating company relief
from limitations of the AT&T antitrust consent decree.  He
wrote Dec. 18 to representatives of a dozen organizations
attending a Dec. 12 morning meeting to thank them for
participating and to urge consumer input in the policy effort.
Although he mentioned introducing legislation, the first step
later this month is expected to be circulation of a bill draft
for comments.  The consumer meeting was part of a series of
meetings with varied interest groups as the subcommittee writes
a bill.

"As I mentioned last week," he wrote to consumers, "I intend
to introduce legislation when Congress reconvenes.  I hope I
can count on your support of the process and the consumer
provisions we will be promoting.  I urge your active
participation in this debate."  Concerned about issues being
framed only by industry perspectives, he said, "I cannot stress
enough the importance of your role in promoting the need for
consumer safeguards amongst your membership and their
representatives in Congress.  I believe this is a great
opportunity for the consumer to reap the optimum benefits from
the innovations now occurring in telecommunications
technology."

The letter went to officers of the Consumer Federation of
America, the National Association of State Utility Consumer
Advocates, the American Association of Retired Persons, the
National Consumers League, Consumers Union, Public Citizen,
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, the Alliance for
Public Technology, the United Church of Christ, the
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, the Intelligent
Network Task Force, and the World Institute on Disability,
the last two of whom participated in the meeting by telephone
conference call.

FEDERAL-STATE TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY SUMMIT SLATED FOR
TWO DAYS IN APRIL

The federal-state regulatory summit on telecommunications,
promised by FCC Chairman Alfred C. Sikes at the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners' November
convention (TW, Nov. 20), has been scheduled for April 25-26
in Airlie, Va.  An FCC news release reported that "invitations
have been issued to all chairs of state regulatory commissions"
and said that the meeting "is intended to permit federal and
state telecommunications regulators to explore shared goals
and objectives."  The summit is being co-sponsored by the FCC
and The Annenberg Washington Program of Northwestern
University.  Also expected to attend are representatives of
the National Governors Association.

At the recent NARUC convention, Mr. Sikes had looked forward
to "rekindling a meaningful federal-state dialogue."  He called
for "mutual trust and understanding" in federal-state
discussions, and he asked for a state commitment to developing
"sound, lasting relationships that will lead to achievement
of the goals that are best for the nation."  The FCC Chairman
favored what he called "cooperative federalism," and he warned
that "if we fail to achieve regulatory equilibrium," more
oversight of the telecommunications industry may shift to the
courts.

U S WEST AWARDED EIGHTH BRITISH CABLE TV FRANCHISE;
CONSTRUCTION PLANNED FOR MARCH

Continuing its pursuit of foreign cable television properties,
U S West has acquired an interest in its eighth British cable
franchise.  Last week, Comment Cablevision, a company owned
by U S West and New Jersey-based US Cable Corp., was awarded
the Tyneside franchise, which includes 340,000 homes and 13,000
businesses.  U S West's seven other British cable franchises-
-Birmingham, Camden, Croydon, Haringey, Kingston/Richmond,
Merton/Sutton, and Windsor--include approximately 1,500,000
households, the company said.  It also has cable TV interests
in Hong Kong (TW, Aug. 7) and France (TW, May 9, 1988).


The third-largest cable franchise ever awarded by the United
Kingdom Cable Authority, Tyneside includes Gateshead,
Newcastle, Ponteland, and North and South Tyneside, U S West
said.  It noted that construction is slated to begin in March,
with completion expected in 1994.  The estimated construction
cost is $160,000,000, it said.  Noting that British cable
franchises carry telecommunications licenses, U S West
anticipated that "Comment Cablevision will offer telephone,
facsimile, and data services along with cable television."

AFTER SPECIAL MEETING, NARUC UNIT TO CIRCULATE COMPENDIUM OF
VIEWPOINTS ON MFJ RELIEF

Members of the Communications Committee of the National
Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners spent from
Jan. 2-5 sequestered at the Asilomar Conference Center in
Pacific Grove, Calif., hearing a variety of industry views on
Bell operating company modified final judgment relief issues.
The 15 commissioners present--or three-fourths of the
committee's members--agreed to develop a compendium of industry
positions on the three core decree restrictions.

To be circulated to all committee members, the compendium
would not only state an industry player's position on the
subject but also the players' motives for taking such a
position.  The group also discussed conducting a survey of
all NARUC members on their views about lifting the AT&T
antitrust consent decree restrictions.  The committee had
decided at its meetings last summer (TW, July 31) to hold an
educational, closed-door session similar to one conducted in
l986 at Dartmouth College.  At the Dartmouth gathering, state
regulators had studied BOC line-of-business relief and public
network advancement issues before developing a consensus for
use in the first triennial review of the consent decree's
restrictions.

The purpose of the "son of Dartmouth" California gathering
was to revisit the committee's MFJ resolutions, particularly
in light of legislation pending before Congress to lift BOC
business prohibitions.  Commissioners devoted most of the last
two days of the conference to discussing MFJ relief position
options.  Development of a specific resolution on a group
consensus would be left for the NARUC winter meetings scheduled
for the last week of February.  Observers noted that from
commissioners' discussions, it was hard to pin down whether a
consensus existed on modifying any of the decree restrictions.
Although some commissioners reportedly wondered aloud what
the harm would be in lifting the information services bar,
for example, any consensus on this specific issue was unclear
following the discussions.

ONA CONFERENCE MEMBERS FROM AMERITECH REGION SUGGEST TRIALS OF
TARIFFING APPROACHES

Ameritech region state members of the federal-state joint
conference on open network architecture (ONA) issues have
proposed a means of letting the Bell regional holding
companies' ONA plans be implemented without waiting for
resolution of jurisdictional tariffing issues.  The Dec. 19
memorandum to fellow joint board members, signed by Michigan
Public Service Commission Chairman William E. Long and Ohio
Public Utilities Commissioner Gloria L. Gaylord, noted
consensus among conference members on several major policy
areas.  The only contentious issue, they said, is the degree
to which ONA services should be tariffed at the federal level.

They pointed out that Ameritech region regulators jointly
have filed comments supporting that RHC's "dual tariffing"
approach.  Rather than calling for a delay in ONA
implementation at the federal level until the tariffing issue
is resolved, the two commissioners urged that the agency adopt
one or more regional plans on an experimental basis.

They offered the Ameritech region plan as one of the approaches
that should be tried.  "It is our view that concurrent approval
by the FCC of several plans would serve to launch the ONA
process and, at the same time, permit actual experience with
alternative programs to supplant what seems to be endless
rhetoric and debate on this subject," the regulators said.

They stressed that "the actual experience gained in this area
would allow for a more comprehensive and insightful examination
of potential problems involving the federal tariffing of ONA
services.  Since certain regions appear to have legitimate
concerns regarding this issue, they would have the benefit of
valuable information gleaned from the experience of others
which would enable them to make more fully informed decisions
in this regard.  Indeed, the conservative approach that we
have just outlined seems well calculated to accomplish not
only the commencement of ONA in some regions, but afford others
additional time to study the situation."

In noting areas of accord among conference members, the four-
page memorandum mentioned "unanimous agreement that the cost
allocation procedures outlined in the FCC's part 36
(separations) rules should not produce any significant mismatch
of costs and revenues resulting from the implementation of
ONA at either the state or federal levels."  It also observed
that the conference is "in almost total agreement that maximum
uniformity should be achieved with respect to ONA to the
greatest extent possible."

In addition, the document stated that the conference is "in
general agreement that certain ONA offerings must be filed at
the state level.  Notwithstanding the various (third computer
inquiry court) appeals" (TW, Jan. 17), "intrastate filings of
ONA services should recognize the statutory authority reserved
for the state commissions in determining the terms and
conditions of intrastate BSEs (basic service elements) and
(basic serving arrangements)," they noted.

At the joint conference's last public meeting in November,
New York Public Service Commission Deputy Chairman Gail
Garfield Schwartz had suggested that the FCC could forbear
from requiring the interstate tariffing of BSEs, without
reaching the jurisdictional question (TW, Nov. 20).  State
versus federal tariffing is one of the issues before the FCC
in reconsideration pleas lodged against its order granting
conditional approval of Bell operating companies' initial ONA
plans (TW, Nov. 21, 1988), and in its docket 89-79 proceeding
on access charge changes required for an ONA environment (TW,
April 3).

OREGON ORDERS U S WEST TO CUT REVENUES BY $24,057,000, LET
DIRECTORY ADS SUPPORT COSTS

The Oregon Public Utility Commission has ordered U S West
Communications to reduce its revenues by $24,057,000 this
year, "so that U S West customers will receive benefits from
telephone directory advertising profits."  As a result of the
ruling, U S West Communications' local and toll rates will be
cut by approximately 5% for residential and business customers.

The PUC criticized the company for attempting to withhold
from its Oregon customers the benefits of a telephone directory
publishing agreement with U S West Direct.  Despite the telco's
"representation that the public would benefit from the
publishing agreement and asset transfer (in 1984), U S West
formulated a corporate strategy in 1986 to divert directory
profits from ratepayers to stockholders," the PUC said.

"The company acknowledged that the strategy would cause local
rates to increase, but (it) nevertheless concluded that it
should pursue the goal of flowing as many dollars to the
shareowners as possible, while minimizing the risk of
imputations from regulatory agencies," the PUC noted.  It
stated that information gathered in the investigation of U S
West Communications' rates showed that in 1985, the
contribution from directory advertising was $40.10 annually
per customer.

Specifically, the PUC directed that the telco's Oregon revenue
requirement include approximately $29,000,000 in profits from
directory advertising.  At the same time, the PUC ordered
adjustments in U S West's revenue requirement related to other
issues.  As one of these adjustments, it allowed the telco to
recover in rates approximately $6,500,000 for research and
development supplied by Bell Communications Research.  The
PUC accepted its staff's and the telco's settlement agreement
addressing the company's capital structure and setting its
rate of return on equity at 13.53%.  Its overall rate of return
was set at 11.2%.

The commission began the investigation of U S West's earnings
in December, 1988.  At that time, the PUC staff estimated
that the company was exceeding its authorized rate of return
by approximately $65,000,000.  Staff later modified its
position after further study during the investigation.  At the
beginning of the investigation, the company had indicated
that it was entitled to a rate increase of approximately
$24,000,000.

INVESTIGATION OF SOUTHERN BELL PAY PHONE COMMISSIONS SPREADS
THROUGHOUT ITS TERRITORY

Florida's investigation of Southern Bell Telephone and
Telegraph Co. pay phone commissions to government agencies
has spread to all four states the company serves.  The
Attorneys General of Florida, Georgia, and the two Carolinas
exchanged information last week at a meeting in Atlanta
initiated by Florida's chief lawyer.  None of the
investigations was far enough along to result in legal moves,
and the company was withholding comment.

Meanwhile, in the wake of some settlements affecting jail and
airport phones, the Florida Attorney General is advising
government agencies to hold off settling accounts pending
investigation.  Involved are commissions on calls at coinless
public phones that make up 5% of all Southern Bell pay phones.
The company has traced commission accounting questions to
switching, finding translation problems in central offices.
Its own investigation is still under way.

KANSAS STAFF RECOMMENDS AGAINST AT&T PRICE STABILITY PLAN,
PROPOSES RATE REDUCTION

The staff of the Kansas Corporation Commission has recommended
that AT&T reduce its basic long distance rates by $2,300,000
per year.  At the same time, it advised the commission not to
adopt AT&T's price stability plan (TW, July 24).  AT&T had
proposed that, after a year's freeze, it should be allowed to
change basic long distance rates based on the annual change
in inflation, offset by a 2.5% productivity factor.  After
the second year, AT&T would be able to change rates without
pricing restraints.

Staff did not find the plan to be in the best interest of
customers.  It noted that AT&T currently is allowed to increase
rates by up to 4% or decrease rates by up to 7% without filing
a rate case.  "AT&T's plan does not act to stabilize rates to
any further degree than the previous flexibility granted AT&T,"
it said.  Staff proposed that AT&T be required to file a
traditional rate case for basic rate increases, but it said
that AT&T could be allowed to lower rates on 20 days' notice.
The commission scheduled Jan. 10 and 17 public hearings on
the AT&T and staff proposals.

BELL ATLANTIC TO SERVE AS NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS MANAGER
FOR HARDEE's PAY PHONES

Bell Atlantic Corp. and Hardee's have cooked up a deal whereby
the regional holding company will serve as the fast-food
chain's national telecommunications manager for pay phones.
During a two-year trial, Bell Atlantic will provide account
management and consulting services with respect to public
phones Hardee's will install in its 1100 corporately owned
restaurants across the country.  The agreement, however, does
not cover an additional 2900 Hardee's outlets that are operated
as franchises, Bell Atlantic said.  It added that it will
offer similar "national pay phone consulting and management
services to other large chains such as quick food, convenience
stores, and hotels."  The regional holding company said that
outside of its territory, it will act strictly as a consultant,
"actually bringing business to pay phone providers."

AT&T FILING NEW BROADLY AVAILABLE STATE TARIFF 16 PLAN, AS
BUREAU LETS SOCS TAKE EFFECT

AT&T was expected, possibly as early as TW's Friday news
deadline, to file a new generally available State Calling
Service (SCS) under its controversial tariff no. 16 for
"competitively bid governmental services."  Meanwhile, the
FCC Common Carrier Bureau last week denied "reject or suspend"
petitions filed against AT&T's State Outbound Calling Service
(SOCS).  Originally filed under transmittal no. 1782 for
members of the Michigan Collegiate Telecommunications
Association (TW, Sept. 4), SOCS was expanded under transmittal
no. 1959 to be available to all "institutions of higher
education owned and operated by a state government or to state
and local government agencies" (TW, Dec. 18).

In its Jan. 5 order, the bureau found that the interexchange
carrier competitors opposing the two SOCS transmittals
presented "no compelling argument" that it should reject or
suspend the tariff.  SOCS, thus, was allowed to take effect
on Jan. 6.  The new generally available SCS offering was
mentioned in AT&T's response to those opposing its transmittal
no. 1959 as the reason why AT&T had not projected any
additional demand or revenues to result from the expanded SOCS
availability.  It is expected that state governments and higher
education institutions will find the new SCS offering more
attractive, a company spokesman noted.

DIALING & DEALING

After several deferrals, AT&T's new "location account billing
option" for software defined network (SDN) service (TW, Sept.
11) was allowed to take effect on Jan. 6, more than one month
after AT&T had received the go-ahead to implement other
portions of a package of SDN rate level and structure changes
previously filed at the FCC (TW, Dec. 4).  The option allows
customers "to include on their networks, under separate bills,
location customers which operate with the SDN customer in a
common business . . .and which the SDN customer owns or
franchises" or "provides centralized management, oversight or
coordination."  The option took effect after the Common Carrier
Bureau last week found "no compelling argument" to suspend or
reject the filing.  Earlier last week, AT&T had filed
additional revisions to the proposed option, under transmittal
no. 2004.
