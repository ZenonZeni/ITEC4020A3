                                                                          168

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honor, we -- we would next like to

     2           call the two witnesses that the Government does not wish to

     3           cross-examine, Mr. Kuromiya and Ms. Warren, in the event the

     4           Court wishes to ask any questions of them, so that we can

     5           release them, if the Court --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And Mr. Croneberger will be around

     7           tomorrow?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Ms. Hoffman is here, Dr. Stayton is

     9           here, and as I understand, Mr. Croneberger will be here

    10           tomorrow.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He'll be here tomorrow.  Okay.

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  He's here now, actually.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Fine.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But will he be here tomorrow to --

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, whenever -- with the Court's

    16           convenience.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, because we -- I think we have

    18           some questions.  Okay. 

    19                    (Recess taken from 2:55 p.m. to 3:10 p.m.)

    20                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Court is now in session.  Please

    21           be seated.

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  Good afternoon, your Honors.  My name

    23           is Christopher Hansen.  I'm one of the lawyers representing

    24           the plaintiffs in the ACLU case.  Plaintiffs' next witness is

    25           Kiyoshi Kuromiya, the director of the Critical Path AIDS

                                                                           169

     1           project.  The Government has advised us that they have no

     2           desire to cross-examine Mr. Kuromiya, so I would like to

     3           first move his declaration into evidence.  His declaration

     4           was signed on March 8th, 1996.  It's been previously filed

     5           with the Court.  I'd like to move it into evidence for his

     6           direct testimony.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's granted.  Do you have any

     8           objection?  Before I grant it, we should hear.  Does the

     9           Government have any objection?

    10                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor, we don't have any

    11           objection.

    12                    COURT CLERK:  Could you identify yourself for the

    13           record?

    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, I will.  I'm Patricia Russotto. 

    15           I represent the Department of Justice as well.

    16                    Your Honor, we do not have any cross-examination for

    17           Mr. Kuromiya this afternoon.  We do not have any objection to

    18           having his declaration admitted into evidence.  However, we

    19           do reserve the right to submit deposition testimony.  This

    20           witness was deposed over the weekend and we do have -- intend

    21           to admit or present to the Court deposition excerpts.  And

    22           we're satisfied that those excerpts will sufficiently address

    23           the issues that Mr. Kuromiya raises in his declaration.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do the plaintiffs have any

    25           objection?

                                                                           170

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  We do not, your Honor, with the

     2           understanding that we could submit alternative pages, if

     3           necessary, of the same deposition.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think the Federal Rules always so

     5           provide, don't they?

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor --

     7                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  The only other --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You do have an objection?

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I might, your Honor, because it creates

    10           a problem for us.  If they put in pages, particular portions

    11           of deposition now, we might want to do some live redirect and

    12           we wouldn't know what their pages are.  If they could tell us

    13           those pages now, we could make that judgment now.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ms. Russotto, could you maybe now

    15           give us some idea of the areas or the paragraphs of his

    16           declaration that these excerpts would rebut or somehow

    17           qualify?

    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Your Honor, I'm really not prepared

    19           to do that this afternoon.  We're going to be submitting the

    20           deposition transcript to address -- to address the areas that

    21           have been raised.  I point out that the plaintiffs had the

    22           opportunity during the deposition to do redirect testimony

    23           and that it was in our view clear during the deposition

    24           process that we proceeded with that process on the

    25           understanding that some of these depositions would be

                                                                           171

     1           admitted into evidence or would substitute for actual live

     2           testimony during the hearing, and that the plaintiffs did

     3           have the opportunity to do that kind of redirect and did not

     4           do it.

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Your --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is the Government finished with its

     7           position on this so that we won't go back and forth.  Okay.

     8                    Mr. Ennis?

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I don't mean to be raising a possible

    10           false alarm.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, go ahead.

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  I think it will be perfectly acceptable

    13           from our plaintiffs for Mr. Kuromiya to leave the stand and

    14           probably whatever we want to put in, other portions of the

    15           deposition transcript will probably be just fine.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, okay, you understand that we

    17           may have some questions now.

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  So you're not going to

    20           ask any questions now?

    21                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, we're not.  We would, however,

    22           reserve the right to do redirect or recross, rather, in this

    23           case if the Court -- depending on what the Court's questions

    24           are.  And also I would say that if the plaintiffs feel like

    25           we have submitted deposition excerpts that they're not --

                                                                           172

     1           that they don't believe are representative of the entire

     2           deposition, they're certainly free to submit their own

     3           excerpts as well.

     4                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Sir, would you state and spell

     5           your name, please?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  My name is Kiyoshi Kuromiya.  That's 

     7           K-I-Y-O-S-H-I, last name K-U-R-O-M-I-Y-A.

     8                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Thank you.  Would you please

     9           raise your right hand?

    10                    KIYOSHI KUROMIYA, Sworn.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?

    12                                 DIRECT EXAMINATION

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Critical Path Project, Incorporated,

    14           that's a nonprofit entity?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, we're a sub S corporation.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A sub S, so it's a for-profit

    17           enterprise?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Actually we -- we work through a

    19           nonprofit organization, but it's a partnership that we set up

    20           by very early on.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A partnership with whom?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  An individual who is no longer around.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And the Critical Path AIDS

    24           Project, is that just a division or is that a sub 501(c)3

    25           organization, nonprofit tax exempt organization?

                                                                           173

     1                    THE WITNESS:  We work through AIDS Information

     2           Network of Philadelphia who handle our financial affairs. 

     3           We're a small organization, one employing myself and one

     4           part-time technical person.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  If you could look on page

     6           two, paragraph six of your declaration, do you have it there?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I don't.

     8                    (Pause in proceedings.)

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'm very curious to know, how

    10           exactly does the technology work?  How do you build up this

    11           access to, as you say here, thousands of data bases that go

    12           through your Web page?  Could you just explain that to me?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  We began in 1989 with a 24-hour

    14           AIDS treatment hotline, specifically for persons with AIDS. 

    15           And we felt that we could provide the kinds of information

    16           that persons with AIDS could not get from other sources.  I

    17           am a person with AIDS myself, and I am also a primary care

    18           provider.

    19                    We began in 1992 with a small computer bulletin

    20           board system.  We have about 1500 people registered under

    21           that system.  We found it was quite effective in getting

    22           information out, both prevention and treatment information to

    23           individuals.

    24                    We also found it important in providing data that

    25           was not easily accessible from other sources, such as full-

                                                                           174

     1           text clinical trials information and information on

     2           alternative treatments.  And we found that neither Government

     3           sources nor clinicians within the community were able to

     4           provide that kind of information, so we found it very useful.

     5                    From that point we began expanding the number of

     6           people who were on our system, and in May of '95 we set up a

     7           Web site and later last year we became an Internet service

     8           provider.  We host a number of Web pages through our system. 

     9           We provide free Internet access for both individuals and

    10           grass roots organizations in the Philadelphia area who might

    11           not otherwise be able to access this information.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So what your Web page links do is

    13           they provide the people who are interested in this site and

    14           the information with a free access to all this information;

    15           is that correct?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And in addition to the information

    18           that you physically assembled yourself, what I'm trying to

    19           get at is you seem to have entered into a number of

    20           arrangements, thousands of them, with institutions including

    21           research institutions, correct?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you do that?  I'm just

    24           wondering how hard it is to do that and how you go about

    25           doing that.

                                                                           175

     1                    THE WITNESS:  It's very easy.  For example, for

     2           someone that wants to locate information at specific research

     3           institutions, we might link to the biosciences database of

     4           links at Harvard University.  And there are many hundreds of

     5           links on that one site.  Through that we have access to

     6           research institutions all over the world.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  For chemistry sites, we would access

     9           them through UCLA.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you get the access?  I

    11           mean how do you physically do that?  Do you write them, do

    12           you call them on the telephone?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  I write the HTML code and we include

    14           that database or that set of links or single links or a

    15           particular document, whatever it is, that's available on the

    16           Internet and provide it for people who use our system.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you say here that you average at

    18           least in the month from February 4 through March 4 of 1996

    19           3,300 accesses per day?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Now, since February 8th,

    22           1996, when President Clinton signed the law in question here,

    23           when he signed that legislation?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Have you all changed anything in the

                                                                           176

     1           way you communicate information to users?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  No.  We're constantly updating our Web

     3           site, but no, we haven't changed anything.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And if this panel were to find that

     5           the law was constitutional, okay, would you have to make any

     6           changes in the way you operate?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I'm not sure how to interpret

     8           that law.  I do not know what indecent means.  I don't know

     9           what patently offensive means in terms of providing life

    10           saving and life promoting information to persons with AIDS or

    11           persons at high risk for contracting AIDS, including

    12           teenagers.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That is, people under 18?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, I don't think you've answered my

    16           question.  You don't know how you would change or you do know

    17           how you'd change?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, my -- as a person with AIDS,

    19           first and foremost is my mission to provide easily

    20           accessible, easy to understand information for people who are

    21           either infected with AIDS or at high risk for contracting

    22           AIDS.  We see that it is a growing situation.  The White

    23           House issued last week a report on the growing epidemic among

    24           young people in this country.  We also know that it's the

    25           leading cause of death for people between the ages of 25 and

                                                                           177

     1           44 in this country and in other countries, and particularly

     2           in minority communities and communities that I'm interested

     3           in providing this information for.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So do I interpret your answer as

     5           saying that you will just take the risk that you'll be

     6           prosecuted, or will you change something?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't know how to interpret. 

     8           I don't know how this Court interprets the indecency and

     9           patently offensive.  I personally find this life-saving

    10           information.  I don't know how it could be interpreted

    11           otherwise.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Fine.  That's all I have.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I have no questions.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have only one.  Did this White

    15           House report provide any information as to the number of

    16           people who are HIV positive below the age of 18 in this

    17           country?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, basically what we get from this

    19           report is the fact that something like 25 percent of all the

    20           people infected with HIV in this country which is

    21           approximately one million people, although that may be

    22           undercounting somewhat.  25 percent of those individuals were

    23           infected while they were very young, either below the age of

    24           18 or shortly thereafter.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your statistics I thought in your

                                                                           178

     1           affidavit went up to 20 something, and I'm trying to, since

     2           our interest here is in young people --

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Well --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you don't know, just please say

     5           you don't know.  I'm not trying to --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's paragraph 22.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me, let me finish the

     9           question.  But that was to the age of 20 and then you go on

    10           to the age of 15 to 24 throughout the world, and I'm really

    11           asking about our universe here, which is this country and

    12           below the age of 18.  And all I want to know is do we have

    13           figures that are segregated that show the number of people

    14           below that age who currently are infected with -- who are HIV

    15           positive.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  We do have some information.  I

    17           can provide the Court with some of that information.  On the

    18           other hand, I must say that HIV is a disease that extends

    19           over a long period of time.  A person does not show any

    20           symptoms for something between seven and ten years after

    21           infection.  That's why I provided the figures that extended

    22           up into the early 20s.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.  Have our

    24           questions elicited any questions from counsel?

    25                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, one or two, your Honor.

                                                                           179

     1                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

     2           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:

     3           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Kuromiya.  I just want to ask you a

     4           couple of questions to pick up on some of the questions that

     5           the judges have asked you here.

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   I believe you had been asked about how exactly your

     8           organization links to other organizations.  That's through a

     9           hypertext link, correct?

    10           A   That's correct.

    11           Q   So that's something you would just click on.  It comes up

    12           on your screen as a highlighted, in a color, and you just

    13           click on that --

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   -- and that takes you to another location, right?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And you write the HTML code yourself for those hot links?

    18           A   I do.

    19           Q   And you taught yourself to write HTML code, right?

    20           A   That's correct.

    21           Q   And that's something that it's your understanding is

    22           going to become easier as new software comes out to help

    23           people write HTML code, right?

    24           A   Probably.

    25           Q   You're aware that there is that software that's coming

                                                                           180

     1           out, though, right?

     2           A   There's a lot of software coming out making it easier and

     3           easier, yes.

     4           Q   Let me ask you also about a statement in paragraph five

     5           of your declaration.  Do you have a copy of your declaration

     6           in front of you?

     7           A   Yes.

     8           Q   Where you talk about your Web pages during the period

     9           from February 4, 1996 to March 4, 1996 were accessed

    10           approximately 98,000 times average 3300 times per day.  Does

    11           that tran -- are you talking about 3300 hits there?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   How are those measured?

    14           A   Those are measured when someone calls up under their

    15           screen a document on our site or accesses our site from

    16           another site.

    17           Q   Okay.  

    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Nothing further, your Honor.

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  No further questions, your Honor.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.

    21                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  One other question, following up on

    23           a question Mr. -- were you here this morning?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That Mr. Baron was asking and Mr.

                                                                           181

     1           Brenner.  When there was talk about encoding your URL with a

     2           self rating system, did you hear that testimony?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I did.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And to use the motion picture

     5           parlance, that NC17, R, PG13, that sort of thing, okay? 

     6           Let's just use that for my hypothetical, all right?  Would

     7           you agree that there's material in your Web site that would

     8           be NC17?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  No.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So you would not -- if you were

    11           required to self rate your system, you would not self rate it

    12           NC17?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  No.  Our material is designed for all

    14           ages and it may be explicit, but it's information that's

    15           necessary to protect oneself from contracting a sexually

    16           transmitted disease.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I'm getting at.  You

    18           would not want, affirmatively, you would not want to rate

    19           your Web page in such a way that young people could not

    20           access it?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  I would not want to deny young people

    22           access to information that was necessary to protect them from

    23           infection from a potentially fatal disease.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, that's what I'm getting at.  So

    25           even if somebody told you you should do that, you wouldn't do

                                                                           182

     1           it.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  I can only repeat what I said.  I know

     3           the difficulties of living with this disease.  I've been

     4           infected for something like 15 years, and have had full-blown

     5           AIDS by the CDC definition since 1993.  And yes, I would want

     6           to protect people who are potentially going to contract HIV

     7           and we know that from current Government statistics that two-

     8           thirds of all high school students are sexually active.  And

     9           so yes, we're providing the information for people who are

    10           sexually active and are potentially exposing themselves,

    11           maybe because of lack of information or the lack of a source

    12           where they can get anonymously information that they need to

    13           protect themselves.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Just so I understand and I think we

    16           put on the table what you're talking about that might

    17           potentially come -- that some people might think come within

    18           the statute are safe sex practices.  Is that really what

    19           we're talking about?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  We're talking about safer sex

    21           practices and descriptions of those practices and how to

    22           protect oneself from HIV infection or infection from other

    23           sexually transmitted diseases.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's the universe of what you

    25           think is potentially at risk in the material for which you

                                                                           183

     1           are the source?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't -- someone might find

     3           material that we find very important as being offensive to

     4           them.  I have no control over that.  So that would --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I'm just trying to find out

     6           what we're talking about.  And what we're talking about then

     7           are certain kinds of sexual practices and maybe some body

     8           parts, and is that the limit of what we're talking about?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  That's correct.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The depiction of body parts?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Possibly.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honor, if I might ask one follow-

    14           up question based on the Court's question.

    15                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

    16           BY MR. HANSEN:

    17           Q   Mr. Kuromiya, when your site discusses safer sex

    18           practices, what language do you use to explain to people how

    19           to use those safer sex practices?

    20           A   We use language that they will understand.  I think that

    21           this may create a problem for some people, since people may

    22           not have the education to understand clinical language.  So

    23           we may use street language, we may use colloquial language in

    24           describing the -- what is high risk behavior and how to

    25           protect oneself.

                                                                           184

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you.  Thank you, your Honor.

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  One more question.  I was just

     3           wondering if you make any effort not to use colloquial

     4           language over the years?  Do you try in any way to explain

     5           the proper terminology?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  My experience comes from --

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand what you mean by

     8           street language, and it's much easier to explain that way

     9           than by using the technical terms, I fully understand that. 

    10           But --

    11                    THE WITNESS:  My experience comes from what I'm able

    12           to -- what communicates via my hotline.  I have for over six

    13           years answered something like 10 to 20 hotline calls from

    14           very concerned individuals of varying ages --

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I just asked simply the

    16           question do you make any effort what the proper --

    17                    THE WITNESS:  I use whatever language is appropriate

    18           to communicate to that individual.  And I don't go out of my

    19           way to use street language.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  All right, I'm just curious.  All

    21           right, thank you.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Gentlemen, ladies?  No. 

    23           Thank you very much.

    24                    (Witness excused.)
