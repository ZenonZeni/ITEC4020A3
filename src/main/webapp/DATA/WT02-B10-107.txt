TMS Technologies was formed to commercialize a new technology for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). MEMS represents the marriage of mechanics and microelectronics. In this technology, conventional integrated circuit processing techniques are used to fabricate mechanical devices (moving structures) at the dimensions of microelectronic devices, and in some cases to integrate the two on a single silicon chip.<P>

TMS utilizes a proprietary plasma micromachining technology to product MEMS devices with high performance and excellent manufacturability for a wide variety of applications. The Phase II SBIR project is concerned with developing a high efficiency DC to DC power converter based on a micromechanical switch technology. This is in contrast to current switching power supplies in which the switching function is accomplished with transistors.<P>

High efficiency switching power supplies have applications in virtually all portable, battery operated electronic instruments, including laptop computers and cellular phones. The military has specific interest in this technology for communications terminals. A very small, high efficiency power converter could also find application in distributed power supply systems, including board level power converters.<P>

Toward the end of the Phase II project, TMS will likely seek to partner with an established power supply manufacturer to move this technology into full commercial production<P>
