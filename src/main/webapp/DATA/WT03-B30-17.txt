Du Pont enters military graphics market

     At a time when longtime defense contractors are rushing for
the Pentagon exit, one of America's biggest companies is knocking
on the front door.
     E.I. Du Pont de Nemours & Co. of Wilmington, Del., is
getting into the defense computer graphics business as part of
its effort in electronic imaging. The company had sales of almost
$33 billion last year, and profits of more than $2 billion.
     Very little of Du Pont's total sales come from the federal
marketplace. However, the huge company could eventually make a
splash in the defense computer graphics world.
     "We are the biggest electronic imaging firm in the world
today as a result of acquisitions," says Jim Kelley, Manager of
the Federal Systems Group of Du Pont's Electronic Imaging
Division.
     Kelley and his team of eight marketeers in Reston, Va., have
studied and canvassed the federal marketplace for the last year.
As yet, they have no defense contracts.
     They're not worried.
Management sets long-term goal
     "Our management has asked us to set up an office and
determine the possibilities," Kelley said. "They have not given
us a financial target.
     "We are still assessing the market."
     Du Pont's Electronic Imaging Division has 800 employees in
Wilmington. In addition, the division owns several other
companies, including CAMEX, a Boston-based company with products
in the newspaper publishing market, and ImagiTex, a New Hampshire
company that makes monochrome scanning systems.
     Du Pont and Fuji Photo of Japan jointly own Crosfield
Electronics, a British company in the field of color electronic
imaging.
     The company also owns most of the stock of benchMark
Technologies, a British company which supplies graphic
accelerators and other high-speed processing systems. Du Pont
changed benchMark's name to Du Pont Pixel Systems.
Graphics key in spy photos
     The Du Pont products form a complete product line in high-
end electronic imagery. The company is not interested in desktop
publishing, which is spreading like a lava flow throughout the
federal government.
     The federal government does little color printing. However,
color graphics computers are very useful in satellite photo
work, simulation and training.
     Kelley is optimistic about the prospects for using Du Pont
Pixel computers for processing color images as a part of larger
systems that work with spy photos.
     Du Pont's role in the field would be to sell the British
computers to systems integration companies in the federal color
graphics business.
     Kelley is optimistic about the intelligence community as a
market in part because it is not hampered by the restrictions
imposed on the rest of the government by Title 44, the basic law
of the Government Printing Office.
     Title 44 forces most federal agencies to go outside for
color image processing and printing. However, the Central
Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and other bodies
in the intelligence community are free to seek the best-quality,
frequently most expensive systems to manipulate color images.
     The Du Pont equipment is not cheap. Many of the products
cost more than $100,000 and go up to $250,000 or more.
     Kelley says he is confident that Du Pont's stature as a
wealthy company that can afford to support a long-term effort in
the field will help him sell computers.
     In a field where many companies are fast-moving,
entrepreneurial and innovative developers in a rapidly-changing
technology-driven market, Du Pont stands as a 500-lb. gorilla
that can afford to wait for profits. The staying power of the
company reassures customers who fear being abandoned by smaller
fry who might go under, Kelley said.
     One of the products in the Du Pont Pixel line is the GIP
graphics and image processing system. It is a series of board and
system level products for use in very high performance graphics
and image processing applications such as command and control.
     GIP offers multiple on-screen images, odd-sized and odd-
shaped windows, and a very large image memory of 640 megabytes.
It runs at 20 million instructions per second as a bit-slice
processor and uses an unusual 160 bit-microcode word.
     The machine could be used by the military as part of a
command and control system that would use digital map displays
with overlays that required rapid updating and extensive storage
and retrieval.

More computer spending waste found

     Billions of wasted dollars is all the Pentagon has to show
for many of its computer projects, according to the General
Accounting Office.
     The congressional watchdog agency blasted the Pentagon for
management bungling which led to design flaws, misjudgements in
requirements, and sloppy accounting.
     Computer spending waste has resulted in the government
lacking the internal control and accounting systems needed to run
programs and safeguard assets, GAO found.
     "Many of the weaknesses are long-standing and have resulted
in billions of dollars of losses and wasteful spending," the
agency said. "Major government scandals and system breakdowns
serve to reinforce the public's perception that the federal
government is poorly managed, with little or no control over its
activities.
     "Top level officials must provide leadership if this
situation is ever to change.
     For example, the Pentagon owns $29 billion of needless spare
parts because of poor inventory controls. That figure has
increased from $10 billion in 1980.
     The Pentagon has also botched its method of furnishing
equipment for use by contractors.
     The Army has no way of telling what happens to $2 billion of
government furnished material in the hands of contractors.
     "These control weaknesses offer the potential for fraud,
waste and abuse of government furnished materials," the agency
said. The Defense Dept. agreed with GAO.
     U.S. taxpayers may also have to give millions of dollars to
foreign governments because of foulups in the Foreign Military
Sales Trust fund. The Pentagon has known about the problem for 10
years but failed to solve it.
     After six years of fruitless efforts to clean up the mess in
the overseas sales program, the Pentagon took responsibility for
system development efforts away from the Defense Security
Assistance Agency and gave it to the Air Force.
     The agency's report on computer waste was titled "Financial
Integrity Act: Inadequate Controls Result in Ineffective Federal
Programs and Billions in Losses."

Slow memory bedevils optical computing

     NEW ORLEANSOptical computing, a promising new
defense technology that has yet to bear full fruit, apparently is
hampered by memory problems.
     "Holograms are still slow. That is one thing that will
either make or break optical computers in general," Mustafa
Abushagur, with the University of Alabama - Huntsville's
electrical and computer engineering department told a laser
conference here last week.
     But if the speed can be increased, optical memory offers
several advantages including higher storage density because laser
precision allows the optical bits to be much smaller. In
addition, optical recording is less sensitive to deterioration or
contamination and less susceptible to head crashing.
Japanese press technology
     Substituting for well known UAH optical computer expert
John Caulfield, who was ill, Abushagur told the LASERS' 89
conference here that the Japanese are working hard on optical
computing and the first applications have come from Japan. "They
are calling optics the technology of the 21st century," he said.
     Abushagur said optical computing in 1989 is comparable to
where electronic computing was in 1949, just before that
technology took off. "It's poorly developed, unreliable,
unstandardized and expensive." He said optics will not replace
electronics but rather complement it.
     He said optical computer researchers' immediate goal is to
make electronic computers faster -- to push the limits of
electronics. Other goals are to develop an optical supercomputer
and exploit the physical differences between optical and
electronic computers to make hybrid systems.
Hybrid computing seen
     Abushagur said near-term applications of optical computing
technology include optical data storage, local area networks, and
optical buses. The major mid-term application is development of
hybrid optical-electronic computers.
     In the long-term, researchers will have to design "new and
different architecture because optics are different and can't
have existing electronic architectures. You have to design and
think differently."
     Researchers are working on both distributed and
multiprocessor architectures.
     He said optical interconnections could range from
machine-to-machine to gate-to-gate and could include the
interconnection of machines, modules, backplanes, boards, chips
and gates. The use of holographic chip connections offers the
potential of changing the computer's architecture just by
changing the hologram connections. "It can be dynamically
changing and continue to function," he said.

Soviets seek software exports

     The Soviets are looking for ways to gain hard currency and
establish themselves as producers of quality software.
     The Space Research Institute of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences is marketing programs for calculating the non-perturbed
(Keplerian) or osculating perturbed motions of planets, moons,
and stars. The software runs under the MS-DOS operating system.
     Keplerian calculations of the motion of celestial bodies are
based on 17th century mathematics. Figuring the perturbed motions
of planets takes into account the complex gravitational effects
of other nearby planets and moons.
     Such software should be approached carefully, however. In
the 1988 Soviet mission to Phobos, a moon of Mars, software
problems cropped up. A ground controller sent the wrong command
to one of two probes; the spacecraft moved to a position from
which it could no longer be controlled.
     The Academy has used the programs to help in design,
navigation and dynamic calculation tasks for the Vega mission to
Halley's Comet and an X-ray emission experiment on the Mir space
station.
     The Space Research Institute also hawks a video data
processing package called SVIT which requires a patented display
terminal. The processor is used for standard image processing
jobs like filtering, quality control, statistical analysis,
segmentation, and classification. The institute received as many
as 300 orders for the system at the Scientific and Technological
Progress Exhibition in Moscow in 1988.
Siberians probe signal processing
     The Computing Center of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences offers the LIBRA-3 library of programs for
use in solving complex problems in mathematical interpolation,
and smoothing of functions of several variables on regular and
random grids, and for signal processing.
     Signal processing extremely important in military computing,
for target recognition and command and control tasks.
     LIBRA-3 is said to be fast because of recent mathematical
advances, and to be suited for many applications in the basic
sciences.
     LIBRA-3 has been used to reconstruct surfaces from
altimetric data, to deblur satellite imagery (smile, U.S.
sunbathers!), and in meteorology. Czechoslovakian, Bulgarian, and
French researchers already use the software package.
ICL to computerize Soviet merchantmen
     Despite their ability to develop some advanced software
packages, the Soviets still lack a broad enough hardware and
software base to meet their needs.
     Britain's ICL and the Central Scientific Research Institute
of the (vast) Merchant Fleet agreed in Dec. 1988 to form a joint
venture to computerize Soviet ships over a three-year period.
     ICL spokesperson Ken Howe in London said ICL will provide
kits that the Soviets will assemble into PCs in Leningrad. The
Leningrad factory, established together with Leningrad local
authorities, will also house software development teams.
     Service centers for the PCs and software will be established
in Vladivostok, Odessa, and Moscow.
     Shipboard computers and control technology will be installed
to run the ASU-Sudno (automated control and management system)
for approximately 600 vessels.
Technology advances but problems remain
     The Soviets have developed a new multiprocessor called the
PS 2100, which reportedly operates in the one billion operations
per second range.
     The new machine replaces the PS 2000, which runs at 200
million operations per second.
     While the new development could signal that Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev's call for a revolution in information
technology is finally focusing Soviet efforts on the
supercomputer field.
     Mass production of computers in the country is, however,
still hampered by the traditional academic approach which leads
to mismatches between the intentions of designers and the needs
of computer users in the industrial sector of the Soviet planned
economy.

     Electronic countermeasures (ECM), the complex science of

     Electronic countermeasures (ECM), the complex science of
jamming enemy signals and foiling electronic attacks, has become
a multibillion-dollar contracting opportunity the past 40 years.
     But when war breaks out, such expensive equipment sometimes
goes by the boards.
     Panamanian fugitive Manuel Noriega tried to counter the
U.S. offensive against his cocaine-financed forces by issuing a
rallying cry on the radio.
     U.S. troops, seeking to counter Noriega's counteroffensive,
decided to disable the transmission equipment after he finished.
     Instead of turning on massive jammers, they simply blew up
the transmission equipment at the radio station east of Panama
City.
     The tactic squelched the former dictator's propaganda
without using complex computing equipment.
     Defense Sec. Richard Cheney said the station had not been
seized early in the Just Cause operation because U.S. planners
gave it a low priority.
     Generations of South American coup perpetrators have known
that taking over the telephone exchange and radio station, as
well as the army barracks and the airport, can give attackers
virtual control of a small country.

     TRW dials for dollars. Getting a requirements

     TRW dials for dollars. Getting a requirements
contract can be a mixed blessing. While the contract figures can
be big, the money doesn't roll in until customers in the military
actually order the equipment. The people who decide whether and
what to buy can be spread through out the Pentagon and reaching
them to urge them to buy can be a daunting task.
     Joseph Aro, manager of marketing for TRW's networks
division, has found a successful way to increase sales under the
ULANA contract. ULANA, which stands for Unified Local Area
Network Architecture, is a large Air Force contract for systems
to link computers in offices and other facilities.
     "Since June we have used telemarketing into the federal
government," Aro said. "We have identified 109 air bases
domestically.
     "We have a database of 20,000 names. Ten thousand of them
are 'qualified.'" Qualified names are people in the military whom
Aro's telemarketing team has talked to.
     Aro refers to the decision makers his telemarketing staff
reaches as "breathers," as compared to non-breathing fax machines
and wrong numbers.
     The telemarketing program appears to be increasing sales of
the TRW systems. Aro's group is shipping 1500 LAN cards per
month, he said.
     Aro said he expects the three-year buying window for the
contract will be extended by the government. The ULANA contract
was jointly awarded to TRW and EDS, the General Motors subsidiary
that was founded by Ross Perot, who since has left.
     TRW appears to be having more success in actually shipping
ULANA products than EDS.
     In addition to the outgoing telemarketing sales program, TRW
is using ingoing telephone lines to service ULANA customers.
Callers who cannot be helped by the customer service staff are
referred to an engineer.
     Aro's extensive contacts with military buyers of computers
lends weight to his assessment of their views of coming defense
cuts. He says the military is divided in two groups.
     One group fears the budget cuts. "The more skittish believe
anybody can lose their job. They think they might be driving a
truck (soon).
     "Others are charging ahead to get the job done."
     Managers of large defense computing projects, in particular,
are not worried, he added.
     "In hard times, the stronger companies can make it."
     TRW hopes to expand its LAN sales into the commercial
market. It is not a player in the commercial market now. But
corporate executives believe their quality equipment and
marketing skills will lead to profits in the non-military field.
     The founder and motive force behind the division is Edward
Simpson, who is the vice president and general manager of the
growing division. He holds a doctorate from MIT and spent 15
years in the Navy.
