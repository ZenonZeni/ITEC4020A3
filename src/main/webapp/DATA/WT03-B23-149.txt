<P>

		<P>
				GSE securities, which were formerly called agency bonds, appeal
				to investors who are interested in high-quality bonds. GSEs are
				issued by major federally sponsored agencies such as the Federal
				Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), Federal National Mortgage
				Association (FNMA), Farm Credit Banks, the Student Loan Marketing
				Association (SLMA), and many more. Although the debt of these federally sponsored
				agencies is not backed by the credit of the U.S. government, they
				are still considered excellent credit risks because the government
				is <I>morally</I> obligated to cover the obligation in the case
				of a default problem. Therefore, the risk is slightly greater
				than Treasuries with similar maturities, which partially explains
				why the yields of GSEs are higher than Treasury securities. The
				other reasons for the yield spread is that GSEs securities are
				less liquid and less marketable than Treasuries.
