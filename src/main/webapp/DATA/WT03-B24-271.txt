<p>The right-wing drive to seize control of the federal government
by capturing the White House and strengthening their grip on
Congress fell short on both counts Tuesday as voters gave
President Clinton a new lease on the presidential mansion and
significantly reduced the GOP majority in the House of
Representatives. </p>

<p>The right wing took it on the chin in campaign after campaign
across the county: Paul Wellstone's rout of Rudy Boschwitz in
Minnesota's senatorial contest, Cynthia McKinney's reelection to
Congress in Georgia; the defeat in Illinois of Al Salvi, the
darling of the militia groups; the victory of Julia Carson, the
first African American woman elected to Congress from Indiana.
Voters returned all sitting Democratic members of the House. </p>

<p>The string of GOP defeats continued with Carolyn McCarthy, the
Republican-turned-Democrat who boasted that she "defeated the
NRA" in her upset victory of a GOP first-termer in New York;
Dennis Kucinich, who overcame a vicious red-baiting attack to
defeat Martin Hoke, Ohio's millionaire GOP congressman; and the
election of the nation's first-ever Chinese-American governor. </p>

<p>And in all of them the AFL-CIO, with its nationally-coordinated
Labor '96 campaign, emerged as the driving force that set the
parameters of the debate, be it for the presidency of the United
States or seats on the Dade County School Board in Florida. </p>

<p>Gary Cox, a key staff member in McKinney's Georgia office, said
the contribution of the AFL-CIO to McKinney's "Street Heat Team"
- a team of 100 union volunteers that began a door-to-door "get
out the vote" drive early on election day - was "awesome. We had
an 80 percent turn-out in our targeted precincts." </p>

<p>McKinney, forced to run in a newly-formed district because of
court-ordered redistricting, won reelection by a 58-42 majority
in a district that is only 30 percent African American. Lynn
Wechsberg, who described herself as a "white, suburbanite soccer
grandmother" and former activist in the New Jersey Republican
Party, worked tirelessly in McKinney's campaign. </p>

<p>"I have become more thoughtful," she said, adding that she was
"particularly offended by the extreme, almost fanatical activity
of the Christian Coalition in Georgia." </p>

<p>Warren Gould called Labor '96 the first rung on the ladder for
change. The New Haven, Conn. Central Labor Council, of which
Gould is president, played a decisive role in two congressional
districts targeted by Labor '96. "We defeated Gary Franks and
increased Samuel Gejdenson's margin of victory from fewer than 50
votes in 1994 to more than 10 percent this year." </p>

<p>Gould said the next step was to "assure that regular, everyday
working and unemployed people get the representation they
deserve. And that means continuing what we've begun by organizing
the unorganized." </p>

<p>Charles Deppert, president of the Indiana AFL-CIO, agrees. "We
deserve an "A" for effort but the labor movement has to grow if
it is to provide a voice for working people." </p>

<p>Deppert said the Indianapolis labor council had a response team
of about 100 volunteers who canvassed Carson's district three
times on election day. "This made it possible for Carson to win
by 10,000 votes in a district that is only 27 percent Black. </p>

<p>Bill Moore, communications director for the Minnesota AFL-CIO,
called Sen. Wellstone's 52-to-41 win a "decisive victory" for
grassroots, door-to-door, one-on-one organizing. "We had more
than 2,000 people working the phones or ringing door bells." </p>

<p>Moore said the state federation had been instrumental in
increasing the bloc of labor-endorsed members of the state
legislature. Moore added that, although the right wing had been
"chastened," labor should have no illusions. "They are still
there and we have to keep the heat on [and] we aren't giving a
blank check to the Democratic Party." </p>

<p>For Cindy Hall, president of the South Florida AFL-CIO, the Labor
'96 campaign "helped us energize our members to deal with local
elections as well." </p>

<p>Hall, who is also legislative director for the teachers' union,
said, "We endorsed candidates for eight of the positions on the
nine-member board. We would have won all of them except for one
candidate who put $300,000 of her own money into her campaign ...
she bought the election." </p>

<p>The Center for Responsive Politics estimates that nearly $2
billion was spent on the presidential and congressional races in
1996, with corporations dishing out seven times as much money as
the $35 million spent by the AFL-CIO to finance Labor '96. </p>
