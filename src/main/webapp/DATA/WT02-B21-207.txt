<!-- FIELD:CMT_OJ -->
<LI>O J bought his way out of a murder conviction.  The issue of murder got lost.
<LI>If you think OJ is still guilty. Then you must let out everybody convected by a jury if they were guilty. I don't see any body standing for the "system"
<LI>media coverage:  saturation;  trial process:  slow, deliberate;  jury decision process:  non-deliberative.  Justice done:  yes, within the guidelines given the jury.  If there is a desire for change, define deliberation for the jury.
<LI>What a sad state of affairs to have this thing crammed down our collective throats!
<LI>OJ & Mark Fuhrman: good luck, and keep looking over your shoulder
<LI>I'm not a US ciizen: it re-inforced all my worst prejudices about Americans' inability to distinguish between form and substance; and their romantic rather than realistic view of the world (eg the Forrest Gump Oscar
<LI>CNN became OJNN. Sensationalism won out over real news. If you notice, the only major newscast that wasn't OJ-drenched was the PBS Newshour? Know why? They don't depend on ratings. Clear example that networks and cable news don't care about providing information, just ratings. It's sad. Really sad. NBC was by far the worst, but that doesn't surprise me. They've spent the last few weeks trying to scare old people into thinking medicare is going away, too. As for the trial itself, no one who was not in t
at jury box has the right to claim that they know what the verdict should be. Outside the jury, we were undoubtedly influenced by the media analysis. Those who are saying "justice was not served" are pathetic. Those who are saying, "this is a victory for Black america" are also pathetic. America is looking bleaker every day. God help us.
<LI>The beginning of the end for American Civilization.
<LI>It only takes MONEY
<LI>The O.J. trial was a fat og of shit, floating in the toilet of America.
<LI>It was a completely inane thing for the American people to waste their collective time on.
<LI>OJ did it and everyone knows it, just 12 people think there was a tiny reaon he didn't because they didn't hear all the evidence that would have fried OJ's ass. OJ will live it up know because people want to even know what toothpaste he uses since the trial. The only reason people thought he was innocent was because they were in a group and he was a hero.
<LI>I got real sick of hearing about nothing but OJ. Also, I think a few of the jurors might have been paid off by the defense. Whoever wasn't was probably afraid of the riots that would undoubtedly have taken place if OJ was convicted.
<LI>it was a sham
<LI>I am surprised that the justice system did not convict and innocent black men!
<LI>Guilty
<LI>If Ron Goldman was a Black Belt Karate expert why didn't he fight back?  There had to be more than one person who did the killing.
<LI>Bullshit
<LI>I think that Johnnie Cochran, in the win at any cost move of raising racial tension issues to cloud the case and get an emotional verdict, has set race relations back 20 years. I thought there was a bottom depth to what a lawyer would go to to win, but a 
<LI>Hang all the lawyers...we need a judicial overhaul!
<LI>THE RACECARD DID It,
<LI>WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS STARTING TO REACT TO WHAT THE BLACKMAN HAS BEEN PULLING FOR A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME IN OUR COUNTRY. LETS SHOW THE BLACK THAT WE WILL NO LONGER STAND BY AND LET THEM TRASH OUR INTER-CITIES, OUR WELFARE SYSTEM AND SCHOOLS. THE BLACK CAN BE A RACIST, HAS BEEN A RACIST AND IS A RACIST FREE LOADING ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FINEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. JUST GET THE HELL OUT BLACKMAN, WE DON'T CARE FOR YOUR KIND ANYMORE !
<LI>I think the trial took to long!
<LI>Glad it's over - even though he walked!!!
<LI>eat at mo's
<LI>money/fame wins everytime
<LI>I feel that the verdict is correct because "reasonable doubt" was very present.  Even if O.J. is guilty, he had to be acquitted due to the way our justice system is established on the premise of "innocent until proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt."
<LI>During the trial, I constantly heard the term " African-American". If a person is born in Africa and then becomes a citizen  of the U.S., they are an African-American. If you were born here, you are black. On applications it states White, not European-American. And to the "educated" BLACK person who called us cave people, I bet you thought O,J, was innocent and supported the racist Million Man March. And people say that blacks can not be racist. Just do us a favor, keep blaming everything on our ancest
rs and fall deeper into the hole of poverty. Thank You!
<LI>AS ONE FROM KOREA, I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE BLACK HAS NEVER MADE AN EFFORT OR ATTEMPT TO BECOME A PART OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY. AMERICANS MUST BECOME TO REALIZE THAT THE BLACK DOES NOT WANT TO BE A PART OF AMERICA, THEY DO NOT WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THEIR OWN PEOPLE, THEY WANT TO ONLY BLAME THE WHITE AMERICA FOR THEIR PROBLEMS. AS AN OUTSIDER, THE BLACK HAS CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS. I WISH THEY WOULD LEAVE THE AMERICAN COUNTRY AND LET THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF THE SOCIETY ENJOY IT.
<LI>During the trial, I constantly heard the term " African-American". If a person is born in Africa and then becomes a citizen  of the U.S., they are an African-American. If you were born here, you are black. On applications it states White, not European-American. And to the "educated" BLACK person who called us cave people, I bet you thought O,J, was guilty and supported the racist Million Man March. And people say that blacks can not be racist. Just do us a favor, keep blaming everything on our ancestor
 and fall deeper into the hole of poverty. Thank You!
<LI>This was a case of who could exploite it and make the most money and publicity out of it. The juror's had to find him not guilty to lock up thier exclusive rights to the trial for monitary gain. It was also the platform for the biggest Black Nazi like raciest Rev. F. (guess who). The theme of this trial was not justice but who can make the biggest buck.
<LI>OJ is a big BROWN piece of SHIT that got away with murder and many other pieces of shit happy because of it. Not because an innocent man got off but because a guilty BLACK man did. RACISTS RACISTS RACISTS.
<LI>I THINK THAT RACE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE VERDICT, AND THAT IN ITSELF IS SAD.
<LI>Black unity is going to foster a race war
<LI>too many blacks on jury
<LI>He got away with murder and the jury had no intention of convicting him. the minute the jury was selected the case was over.
<LI>Other countries now think we're all stupid for the whole trial issue.
<LI>The trial was sort of interesting
<LI>As I read some of the comments, I was wondering what the hell is an African-American. If you did'nt move to the U.S. from Africa, you are black. I am not called a French-American because some of my family lived there hundreds of years ago. And this oppression shit, we don't owe you all a damn thing. Do you think honestly believe that if your "oppressed" ancestors saw you today that they would be proud. I know just as many blacks as I know niggers and I know just as many whites as I know white trash. Th
s case was nithing but race and it hurt the black community more than it helped it. The only reason the Million Man March should'nt have been bombed is because it was held in our nation's capital. That was a poor excuse to express racist views. People need to realize that any culture can be just as racist as another. To the NIGGER that called us cave people, FUCK YOU. I got a 12 guage, long rope, and a tall oak tree for your black ass.
<LI>Glad it's over!
<LI>If a white man killed two blacks, blacks would say guilty!
<LI>He's guilty or a thousand coincidences did it. You judge.
<LI>I'M SICK OF HEARING ABOUT OJ
<LI>the verdict was not guilty so lets shut our mouths and let oj live his life the way he wants get off his back if he did he will pay GOD knows and see everything nicole was not angel she was drug user and gay so was ron goldmand face it
<LI>The verdict was a joke, now a know killer is walking free.  Watch out Paula!!!!
<LI>Money talks
<LI>I'm ashamed at the Afro American community's reaction to the verdict. They could have kept thier jubilation to themselves out of respect for Brown and Golman families. I think the reaction only supported negative impressions held towards the African Ameri
<LI>Guilty, but not enough evidence to convict.
<LI>Perhaps those who feel the trial is unfair should think about what it must have been like for all people of color who had to woory about a fair trial for more than 100 years.
<LI>They should televise more trials so that everyone can see what is right and wrong with our Justice system.
<LI>70 murders are committed a day in america , why is this one so important?The racial issue : the accusers of racism are only setting themselves back ten years when they do shit like that
<LI>Begone, foul media diversion and agent of division.
<LI>I feel the jury was unequally balanced, trail too long, the two jurors that voted no were made to change their minds, cochrane is a huge jerk that has stated how race has played a role in the trial and how this verdict now pacifies the anger of those hurt by the King verdict.  Very sad mess.
<LI>It was a waste of time, because there was no way in hell he was going to be convicted because he was a football player and a star.
<LI>Don't ever ban cameras from the courtroom. They're the public's eyes to the world.
<LI>USa - ????!!!!!
<LI>I didn't like the trial.  If they charged someone normal nobody would of heard about it.  I think all those lawers were a waist of money.  I would rather go to jail than go out in the world and have most people hate my and want me to go to jail.
<LI>A moral and ethical OUTRAGE !!!
<LI>The trial proved a few things without a shadow of a doubt: 1. Money talks.  2. California is a circus.  3. Racism is the biggest problem in this country.  The justice system in this country has always be a farce.  Money has always been the best defense.  This is the 1st time someone black utilized the technique, and white america cannot deal with it.  O.J. may be guilty as sin, but he did what every rich american is supposed to do...spend your way out of it.  What saved him in the long run was Mark Fuh
mann.  After Mark was exposed, jurors had to vote not guilty. LA. has a terrible, long and ugly track record with the poor communities. And the fact is Mark F. could have doctored evidence.  It would be hard to have anything other than reasonable doubt after that explosion.  Finally, we all know if this had been about his 1st wife and a friend, the whole thing would have been covered once and forgotten.  That alone speaks volumes about race and America.
<LI>OJ simpson is a piece of crap that deserves lethal injection
<LI>We Have Given The Black More Than Enough Opportunities Over The Past Several Decades To Become A Part Of The System. LET'S FACE IT, THE BLACKS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN TEARING OUR SYSTEM DOWN THEN THEY ARE IN CONTIBUTING TOWARDS IT'S FRUITFULLNESS !!!!!!
<LI>It's hard to get good information on what the evidence was.
<LI>America is sad.  Why did we all care so much?
<LI>It's funny how the black people were cheering after the verdict not because OJ was found not guilty but because a black man got off (with murder mind you). Let me ask this to the blacks, would the verdict still be the same if the two dead were white or if
<LI>TV coverage forced the case to be a huge pseudoevent, larger than it ever should have been.
<LI>That was the sorriest excuse for justice I've ever seen. OJ should hang!!! His lawyers are prostitutes.
<LI>Jurers should be selected that are smart enough to handle the degree of the information being given to them.  The remaining O.J. jurers dcould be persuaded into finding reasonable doubt about every piece of evidence put before them.
<LI>it was pointless, and nothing was accomplished, if OJ didn't do it, then who did.  All of the evidence they did have pointed to OJ.
<LI>I think the prosecution lost the case
<LI>Ito should never have allowed the question that Mark Fuhrman was asked, namely "Within the past ten years have you ever used the 'N' word when referring to a member of the black race...etc."
<LI>this trial sucked. death to O.J.
<LI>YOU CAN THANK THE LIBERAL ESTABLISHMENT FOR WHAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BECOME. THE BLACKS CRY DISCRIMINATION AT EVERY CORNER AND GET AWAY IT. THEY TRASH OUR INTER CITIES AND WELFARE SYSTEM AND WE STAND BY AND DO NOTHING. WE ALOW ILLEGAL ALIENS TO FLOOD OUR BORDERS, RAPE OUR MEDICAD SYSTEM, DISRUPT THE WELFARE SYSTEM, COMMIT SCORELESS NUMBERS OF CRIMES THAT GO UNSOLVED.... WELL, WE CAN GET MAD AND SAY WE ARE GOING TO REACT, BUT NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM.. WE'VE INSTALLED A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE IN POSITONS IN THE 
OVERNMENT THAT ARE ALLOWING THE BLACKS AND OTHER MINORITIES TO RAPE AND PILLAGE OUR SYSTEMS. YOU SAW A PERFECT EXAMPLE IN THE o.j. TRIAL WHEN THE BLACKS LOOKED OUT FOR THEIR OWN IN LIU OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. WHITE AMERICA HAS A TOUGH ROAD AHEAD TO VOID THIS COUNTRY OF THE BLACK CANCER AND BRING BACK THE SAFE STREETS AND SCHOOLS. THE MOST OBVIOUS THAT COMES TO MIND IS INSTALLING THE BLACKS ON RESERVATIONS IN THE DESERT AND JUST LET THEM DROWN IN THEIR OWN WASTE.
<LI>There was so much evidence that OJ really committed this crime. It is so sad that there may never be justice for Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.
<LI>It's funny how the black people were happy after the verdict not because justice was served, but because a Black man (who hasn't contributed anything to the black community) got off. This shows who the real RACISTS are.
<LI>The Justice system and the LAPD are corrupt.
<LI>the rich get richer and the poor get poorer
<LI>I believe that a non-famous person would have not have been tried do to the errors on the state's side with the mis management of the evidence.  
<LI>Absolute disgrace of a trial, disgraceful outcome, California should be kicked out of the US if they can't convict a murderer.
<LI>This is full of shit.. go to hell.. I'm gonna kill OJ
<LI>Money talks and that...is that
<LI>the jurors were biased because oj was a celebrity, and they were in awe of him.
<LI>What a Joke!  Guess the jury showed us, huh.
<LI>it's getting old--we should clue the media in on this fact!
<LI>RACE! RACE! RACE! RACE!  Black people can apperently do whatever they want, so long as there is a black jury to decide their fate!
<LI>leave oj alone.  the trial is over; if you disagree tuff. I think much of the fuss is still racial. i.e. white folks think a black man killed a white woman and they are ballistic.  get on with your lives; if oj is guilty, he will pay period and it is out of the hands of ordinary men and women.  OK.  So go back to speaking with the people of color on your job.
<LI>HE'S GUILTY, HE'S GUILTY, HE'S GUILTY, HE'S GUILTY
<LI>Puts american justice into perspective. All hail Fuhrman/KKK!
<LI>I don't agree with the verdict but they should leave it alone for the sake of the children of OJ and Nicole. Whether he's inncoent or guilty its the children who will suffer. So drop it and leave them alone.
<LI>The defense was sleazy, but i have seen sleazier
<LI>Disgusting!
<LI>A mockery of the American judicial system.
<LI>He's a murderer; we all know it!
<LI>The trial did not shake up my confidence in the system of law which we run but it did raise serious questions as to the right of the press to be involved. it became a circus and the best possible press in retrospect would have been that only artists be pe
<LI>An extremely sad circumstance for victim's families.
<LI>the jury didn't care about guilt-they're racists
<LI>OJ's Ride & Letter... Oh, he knows nuffin'
<LI>The jurors were a bunch of idiots...who had no clue about understanding the blood evidence
<LI>An innocent mans life is ruinned.
<LI>We (white america) need to change the judicial system, when a Nigger leaves court, and he isn't in in handcuff & sentence for 15 to life there is a serious problem with our Court System.
<LI>Until they  find the killer, I will in my heart believe OJ is Guilty as hell.
<LI>I believe the trial showed that our justice system can still work because there was too many inconsistancies for there to be a conviction.  The jury did what was asked of them by weighing what they saw and deciding if there was any reasonable doubt, which they obviously thought there was.
<LI>I think that it is a poor excuse for a trial.  If it had been me or you, we would have been hung within the hour.  If O.J. did not do it why did he run?  Who cares if the gloves didn't fit?  Who cares if he was black.  It should not have been made a race issue, but thanks to the defense team it was.  I can only pray that the Goldman family and the Brown family find some sort of comfort in this horrible tragedy.
<LI>It was good the trial was televised, because the viewer could hear/see the evidence and make his/her own decision about guilt or innocence.  Instead of "reporting" the news as the media should have done, the public was overwhelmed with personal opinion an
<LI>How can OJ go on in life when he knows what he did!
<LI>Somebody shoot OJ!!
<LI>I suspect the problem with the prosecution's case is the fact that the jury, as a group and individually, judging by their actions -Black Power salute to Simpson, rolling of eyes and inability/refusal of old lady jurors to listen to a brilliant white woman, the rush to the publisher's office--just who do these idiots think will buy a book when NO ONE in the world really can believe the man is innocent.  As a former abuse victim, I know that Nicole knew she was being killed, she knew that this man who h
d fathered her children and she appareently loved at one time was doing it to her, and then she didn't know anything.  But those of us who can relate to her nightmare of a life will never, ever look at OJ the same.  He doesn't deserve citizenship in the country.
<LI>Too bloody long!
<LI>OJ should live a quiet, private existence (as much as possible) for the next 50 years.
<LI>pathetic
<LI>too bad.... so sad..... bye-bye
<LI>The prosicution took too long to present their case.
<LI>O.J. is quilty as sin. The knife was dropped in the steel pole of the frost fence. Kato heard O.J. pounding the cap back on the tubular steel pole. The knife is in the steel frost fence. They never explained to the jury the fact that Kato heard the three bangs outside of his room...One of these days water will find its level!!! and O.J. will be drowing.. P.S. I hope that the jury do have good night sleeps!!!!!!!....
<LI>I really miss it.
<LI>OJ was guilty,but the jury cannot be blamed for their verdict due to teh sloppywork by the LAPD
<LI>Viva La OJ
<LI>MONEY TALKS, OJ WALKS.  MAYBE NOW ALL AFRICAN AMERICANS WILL STOP WHINING ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.  YOU SEE, THE JUSTICE SYSTEM DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN, JUST THE COLOR OF YOUR MONEY!
<LI>It wasn't the "trial of the century". it was the "circus of the century"
<LI>The verdict stinks!
<LI>If that is the way trials are acted out--stay out of the courtroom!  It was a circus that was played for the camera and the victims were forgotten.  It could have been over in two months if the cameras were out of the room and the two sides had gotten down to business instead of showbusiness.
<LI>We (the People) never had a chance: most if not all the jurors never intended to find him guilty. They went into the trial believing he was not guilty and nothing the prosecution might have done would have ever convinced them otherwise.  Even if there had been an eyewitness or an admission of guilt they would have found him not guilty.
<LI>IT'S TIME TO STOP IGNORING THE FACTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS VIEWED THIS MATTER AS A RACIAL ISSUE AS THEY DO ANY TIME THERE IS A MATTER THEY ARE INVOLVED IN. 73% OF THE BLACKS THAT RIOTED IN L.A. DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WERE RIOTING OVER. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL NEVER BEEN STRAIGHTENED UNTIL ALL RACES CAN ACT IN A RATIONAL MANNER. THE BLACKS ON THE SIMPSON JURY MADE UP THEIR MINDS THE FIRST WEEK OF THE TRIAL.
<LI>Money bought freedom to OJ / Race card invoked helped OJ to win jury sympathy. There was some doubt/ OJ is a killer
<LI>Words can't describe how devastated I am over this verdict.       
<LI>sad day for the justice system, evidence should have been hanle more properly.
<LI>Guilty or innosent isn't the important issue now.  The hate is.
<LI>Make police officers personally responsible for illegal action
<LI>Crime Pays
<LI>what a travesty of justice.all the facts and evidence proved the man killed Nicole and Ron.  Cochran inflamed the jurors with the race card, and L.A. is a hotbed of black anger.  the jurors were tired of being sequestered, which is why they voted "Not Guilty" so quickly.  Ito was a weak judge.  Darden, a weak attorney.  Cochran was full of rhetoric and inflammatory statements. He was the best lawyer there.  Clark came across as a prissy schoolmarm.
<LI>Mark Furhman, why hasn't he been arrested?
<LI>I am white, I am female, I am not a racist, this is not a racist issue, this issue is about one thing--our justice system needs severe and radical change!!! From the cops who messed up gathering the evidence to the cop that lied to the judge who was in charge to the lawyers who were a joke, to it all... These are the facts-- he beat his wife repeatedly, there was alot of "reasonable doubt", THEIR BLOOD WAS FOUND IN HIS PLUMBING!!! (although not entered into evidence those in crimianl justice arena know
this to be true and know it was not entered due to disclosure problems).  take a good look at our judicial system speak out for there is great need for radical change and its up to us as AMERICANS (black, white, purple for that matter!!!) to vocalize our desire for extreme change.Get a grip people this is the issue, it is not over it will continue until we make the system change.
<LI>No comment.
<LI>It sucked
<LI>I am white, I am female, I am not a racist, this is not a racist issue, this issue is about one thing--our justice system needs severe and radical change!!! From the cops who messed up gathering the evidence to the cop that lied to the judge who was in charge to the lawyers who were a joke, to it all... These are the facts-- he beat his wife repeatedly, there was alot of "reasonable doubt", THEIR BLOOD WAS FOUND IN HIS PLUMBING!!! (although not entered into evidence those in crimianl justice arena know
this to be true and know it was not entered due to disclosure problems).  take a good look at our judicial system speak out for there is great need for radical change and its up to us as AMERICANS (black, white, purple for that matter!!!) to vocalize our desire for extreme change.Get a grip people this is the issue, it is not over it will continue until we make the system change.
<LI>This proves that our justice system needs despirately to be overhauled. It should not be "guilty-beyond a reasonable doubt", evidence should not be disallowed because of the untimeliness of discovering crucial evidence preventing disclosure, there should not have to be 12 full counts of guilt or innocence, for if the supreme court can't rule unanimously on most of their decisions as highly trained judicial personell, how can citizens be expected to do so? Speak out folks, not to me or to others but to 
hose who count-- petition, vote, scream if you have to-- change it now before its total anarchy in the streets instead of inadequacies in justice.
<LI>O.J. was guilty. He proved it by running in the begining.
<LI>I am glad it is finally over!!!
<LI>HE WAS GUILTY
<LI>with as much income as o.j has already collected from this, he's probably wondering why he didn't kill her years ago. 
<LI>I feel ill about the outcome. I hope someone picks him off!
<LI>A viscious murderer has laughed in the face of our justice system. The american psyche is in a state of unrest. It will interest me to see what developes from here. My only hope is that this issue will not fade away and that justice will prevail. 
<LI>PREDICTION::::: PAULA BARRBARELLI AND THE BRENTWOOD BUTCHERS RELATIONSHIP WON'T LAST TWO YEARS, ALTHOUGH AFTER THE BREAKUP PAULA WILL ANNOUNCE THAT THE BRENTWOOD BUTCHER COMMITED THE MURDERS.... AND MORAN AND THE OTHER BLACK JURORS WILL CLAIM THAT THEY FELT HE WAS GUILTY....
<LI>A guilty man  was set free by an uneducated/biased jury!
<LI>so what happens in a few years when Paula Barrbarelli turns up dead.....are we going to blame Mark Fuhrmann again?
<LI>Those on the jury should have to take an IQ test to see if they have the capacity of coming to an intelligent decision...Something that no one on this jury could even comprehend.  Did anyone get a load of that one stupid juror on Larry King Live? The black girl with the braids hanging over her face?  Larry asked her a question about DNA and she just SAT THERE! She didn't even know what he was talking about! Her HUSBAND had to answer the bloody question! She obviously had no brain cells working at all.
<LI>It is sad that so many should read so much about your country's legal system on the basis of one man's trial.
<LI>I cried for three days after the verdict. If I were an intelligent and fair minded black person, I would be very embarrassed and outraged. Early on the jurors said they were going to have a victory party when it was over and invite OJ.  That tells you that they went into this with the intention of finding him not guilty and at no time did they consider the evidence against him.  Sick. 
<LI>UGH!!! LET IT DIE!!!
<LI>IT WAS FUN TO WATCH
<LI>Ahmad Rashad set OJ up.
<LI>o.j.- good luck with your golf game-keep looking for the killer or KILLERS on the 14th fairway. Paula-watch out!!!
<LI>This case was handled very poorly!
<LI>the survey is incomplete because some questions wouldn't let me answer them.  I have a 386 with lots of memory.  I accessed the net via prodigy
<LI>What a joke!!!
<LI>the verdict was not guilty so we need to let it be whites seem to think that this was wrong but only GOD knows the truth and all name calling racist remarks should not be we all are human what if a white man commited the murders what would you say then I think you would probaly say she wasn't any good and he was gay but by this man being black he had to be the one I am a white american and have been around black men they don't kill this way they shoot or beat you with their bare hands only whites and G
YS cut you up
<LI>I GOTSTA KNOW, IS IT TRUE THAT JOHNNY COCKRAN IS MALE, AND IF SO, DID O.J. RECEIVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN LEGAL SERVICES FROM COCKRAN ? 
<LI>I now have no fear of snapping out and killing people...all I need are a few male jurors that find me attractive and I'll get off.
<LI>Marcia Clark needed to wear shorter skirts
<LI>SIMPSONS FUTURE LYES IN THE FACT THAT HE IS A PRISONER OF HIS GUILT.
<LI>The one thing nobody has mentioned is that no one but the jury knows what the jury knows.  They were pretty isolated, and lots of info was never presented to them.
<LI>I've found America had gone mad.
<LI>God is the only true judge
<LI>We need Jack Ruby Back!!!
<LI>the whole trial is the greatest job in American history
<LI>I'm glad O.J. was found not guilty. This Trial should have never gone to trial!
<LI>Niggers are the source of all problems in the U.S. today.
<LI>Solve one problem at a time. OJ not RACE, now RACE not Green , etc...
<LI>I HOPE THIS TRIAL WILL BRING LIGHT TO THE BLACK PLIGHT AND THAT IS TO USE THE RACE CARD AT EVERY TURN. I AM GLAD THAT THIS TRIAL SHOULD PROVE TO THE WORLD THAT THE AMERICAN "FREE LODING" BLACK IS THE CANCER OF THIS SOCIETY. 
<LI>I was incredibly shaken by the verdict, even though I did
<LI>it sucked
<LI>too long and too technical for the jury
<LI>OJ sucks and karma will get him in the end!
<LI>It was not a trial, it is a drama.
<LI>OJ got away with MURDER
<LI>Johnny Cochrane used this as another opportunity to divide us racially.
<LI>As a Canadian, I find the American Justice System very entertaining by NOT very effective. 
<LI>I avoided watching it whenever I could.  It was like a sleazy soap opera.
<LI>I believe the media has caused more problems than the trial. I also am tired of being told the only reason I believe OJ was guilty was because he was black, I believe it because of the evidence, and I'm sorry but whether he is innocent or not he is not a hero, he is a wife beater!!!!!!
<LI>No one knows whether he committed the murders.  What is shocking is the anger many whites felt after the verdict.  Many felt it was reverse discrimination, I guess know they understand how blacks felt moments after the Rodney King trial when an all white jury acquitted the police officers of the beating even though the crime was right in their faces on VIDEOTAPE.  Maybe one day there will be justice all around, but until we stop judging people by who they are and what they look like/the color of their 
kin, etc. the justice system will always stay the same.
<LI>I believe the media has caused more problems than the trial
<LI>This is the reason for NOT having TV in the courtroom!!
<LI>Justice was served the same as the Rodney King case being found "Not Guilty" does not mean the defendant is "Innocent"
<LI>Thank God I live in Canada with OUR justice system.
<LI>THEY HAVE TRASHED OUR INTER-CITIES, THEY HAVE RAPED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM AND NOW WE ARE ALLOWING THEM TO POLICE THEIR OWN. MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT AMERICA BECOMES AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS THE BLACK THAT IS THE MAJORITY RACIST IN THIS COUNTRY. THE SIMPSON TRIAL SHOWS THEIR TRUE COLOR AND IT IS THE COLOR THAT HAS BEEN USED IN EVERY EXCUSE AND EVERY SEGMENT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
<LI>TH
<LI>Guilty as hell. if he didn't do it? who the hell did, then, huh? there is just nobody else who it could have been.
<LI>A verdict of not guilty has been handed down.  Except it.
<LI>gloup gloup
<LI>I never watched or listened until after the verdict. It was all too stupid.
<LI>I think the jury was afraid of what would happen if they voted guilty - didn't want a repeat of the Rodney King verdict-outrage. I also think the jury were not OJ's peers - they were ignorant, and very different than OJ's true peers.
<LI>money talks the guilty walks
<LI>I hope I never have to see another trial like that again.
<LI>The trial is not finished yet. We are going to see one more Hurricane Carter. The LAPD will not leave him alone. The FBI. The CIA. The IRS. You name it.    
<LI>This verdict makes me sick.  Not one of the BLACK jurors had a high enough I.Q. to even be considered a "human being".  O.J. was acquited because he is black.  But beware black America.... this verdict has brought so much anger to whites, that you should fear the TRUTH about your race being accepted.  Blacks are bleeding this country dry.  BLACKS ARE ONLY 12% OF THE POPULATION, BUT THEY COMMIT 2/3 OF ALL VIOLENT CRIME IN AMERICA!!!  haha, this is shocking, to say the least.  Oh, one more thing:  Throug
out 6,000 years of recorded history, the Black African Negro has invented nothing.  Not a written language, weaved cloth, a calendar, nothing, not even the wheel.  For shelter the African never progressed beyond the common mud hut, the construction of which a beaver or muskrat is capable.  I rest my case.
<LI>I hope all civil cases clean O.J. out!!!!
<LI>Jurors were bent on the idea "we've been oppressed 400 years"
<LI>THINK ABOUT IT BOZO'S MAYBE HE DIDN'T DO IT !!!!!!!!!!
<LI>time will tell justice was served
<LI>OJ's cool and if he did it he's lucky but i doubt he did it.
<LI>This is a total outrage, hope someone shoots oj 
<LI>Depressing, lies, smoke and mirrors.
<LI>Lack of deliberation by jurors exposed the sham.
<LI>The trial was a farce created by the defense.
<LI>THE JURY FAILED TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTI0NS OF THE JUDGE.
<LI>THE ONLY REASON HE GOT OFF WAS BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK AND THE 
<LI>If OJ did it, he will pay.  What goes 'round comes 'round!
<LI>O.J is guilty.
<LI>This trial was a joke and an embarassment to our society...it never should have happened.
<LI>This trial was enlightening to those  of us who thought race was not the main issue of the trial
<LI>It sucked
<LI>JURY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INTEL
<LI>If it doesn't fit, acquit--- that was KEY for me!!!
<LI>O.J. was an innocent man who angered whites because they did not get their way for once. LONG LIVE O.J. <rlong@acsu.buffalo.edu> Peace
<LI>no comment
<LI>That nigger should die! (just kidding, not that passionate)
<LI>" THE BLACK HAS AWAKEN THE SLEEPING GIANT, I FEAR FOR THE BLACKS NEXT GENERATIONS" read the polls, our intercities will not be safe, our welfare system will not be secure until the BLACK is seen as what they represent and that is a very low form of human life.
<LI>justice was served.and america should get over it
<LI>COCHRAN IS THE VERY EXAMPLE OF THE BLACKMAN, CRY RACE AND LATER DENY, "IF YOU CRY YOU MUST DENY". TAKE A LOOK, THE JURIES DOING THE SAME THING. A WEEK AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER MORAN AND THE OTHER BLACK JUROR STARTED CHANGING THEIR STORIES. WAKE UP LIBERIAL AMERICA, THE BLACK IS DUMPING ALL OVER YOU !
<LI>not guilty, not guilty, not guilty
<LI>With the muscle of money and influence (LAPD), it's no wonder that prisons are full of "Defenceless" and likely innocent minorities!
<LI>Denise Brown should ask her friend Tony to arrange a "hit" on O.J. - make sure they stab him at least thirty times before slashing his throat from ear to ear.  P.S.  It is pretty hard to have any respect for black people when you see them celebrating the release of a brutal murderer.  Maybe he'll kill a couple of black people next time, although I doubt it since they only people he seems to hang around with are white.
<LI>sad!
<LI>biggest joke in history, you got money, you can get away with murder
<LI>The trial was biased once it was put on the air.
<LI>O.J. should definitely be tried again! (and found guilty!)
<LI>Johnny Cochran & Alan dershowitz are two of the biggest loud mouths I have ever listened to.  Their ego's are beyond belief.  I have never seen anything like it.
<LI>OJ has been found innocent.  Let's leave it at that.
<LI>Even before this trail, i have felt the need for an IQ test for jurors.  I mean no racial animosity, I feel in my gut that this case was viewed as payback and restitution for prior wrongdoings by my racial ancestors.  Too bad it will probably backfire wit
<LI>No comment. 
<LI>Although I predicted the outcome, I really believe he is quilty and should be made to pay.
<LI>WHITE AMERICA, HOW CAN YOU EVEN DEFINE THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE?  YOU RACE HAS RAPED CULTURES FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME.  IN FACT, YOU ALL DO NOT EVEN HAVE YOUR OWN CULTURE, WHAT YOU ARE NOW IS SIMPLY A COMPILATION OF THE CULTURES THAT YOU HAVE HISTORICALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.  FUCK YOU CAVE PEOPLE.  YOU MAKE ME SICK
<LI>Where can I geta a hold of Marcia Clark????
<LI>Guilty, Guilty, Guilty... A travesty
<LI>the americans should let oj go on with his life GOD knows everything and Nicole was a LESBIAN and RON was a HOMOSEXUAL that is why his FATHER was crying and so angry because he disowned him and never got a chance to tell him that he loved him.  Ask his FATHER see his reaction
<LI>Everyone knows OJ did it, but everyone also knew he would get off because of his staus as a superstar and he is black with a black jury.  Even prosecution knew they were up against the wall before the case started.  Furman's a jerk and I hope he goes to jail for a long time, we don't need people like him around.
<LI>they neeed to find the killers
<LI>i think that this has contributed to the worst racial climate in US hitory!
<LI>Hang OJ
<LI>Money wins again, as exemplified by many corporate trials. This trial was "different" only because big corporate trials aren't as well publicized.
<LI>it's not about race.  It about a man who killed his ex-wife, regardless of race.  He is guilty! the jury was rigged!
<LI>your americans are totaly mad, doing such a media skandal trial. hinrichs@zeitgeist.de
<LI>the raisail virdict is discraceful 
<LI>Unreal! This is a joke!
<LI>victims & their families were not represented!
<LI>I think because OJ had so much money that he could pay his lawyers to give reasonable doubt.  If it was a poor person it would have been a guilty verdict.  
<LI>Juries don't have majic powers, just because they say he's not Guilty does NOT mean he didn't Do it.  Who else has Ron Goldman's blood in their car???
<LI>between the jury, the race card, and the experts Simpson was able to hire, it wqas clear he wouldn't be found guilty. Not guilty is not innocent. He did it!
<LI>the prosecution did their best, the LAPD screwed it up !!
<LI>I think it was just a big joke, an embarassment!
<LI>Who cares???
<LI>Disappointing - Gil Garcetti should be thrown out of office!
<LI>The race card was played and race relations are suffering
<LI>OJ is guilty,guilty,guilty,guilty,guilty!
<LI>It is over.  OJ is ruled not guilty.  Let's move on.
<LI>It is wrong to glorify a sick bully!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>This was a total moquery of the justice system
<LI>Just because OJ was aquitted does not mean he is innocent, his defense team just provided reasonable doubt. Guess you could say he "bought" his freedom. I was under the assumption that he was guilt, but I have to have faith in our Justice System,even though it has been shaken, in order for this country to stay free.
<LI>I sincerely think that the whole thing- from the car chase to the whole trial was a huge media circus. I sincerely think that the trial should have not been televised, but it does not matter because the verdict would have been the same anyway.
<LI>O.J. should declare a life of celibacy and get thee to a monastery
<LI>if marcia clark had been my lawyer i would rather have had Perry mason and he's been dead for over a year!
<LI>I can't believe he was found not guilty!!!!
<LI>I have been a fan and supporter of O.J. Simpson for many years, but I believe he moost likely committed the murders, or was at least an accessory to the murders. However, had I been on the jury, I think I would have had to vote "not guilty" because there was a sufficient defense case presented to support a "reasonable doubt" interpretation of the evidence presented. I feel so badly for the Brown and Goldman families. God knows what happened that night and if justice was not done in the courtroom, it mo
t assuredly will be done on judgment day. God bless Nicole, Ron, Justin and Sidney.
<LI>I think that we as Black people need to realize that this is BUT ONE victory for us.   It is simply one case in which Justice was truly served FOR US.  I doubt that there will be another high-profile trial like this one in which a black suspect will be acquitted.  White America is PITIFUL and SORRY for doubting the fact that we have the ability to make rational decisions.  GROW UP AND WAKE UP!  YOU MUST REALIZE THAT THOSE WHO WERE LAST WILL BE FIRST--SOON.  LOOK OUT, THE FALL OF THE WHITE MAN IS APPROA
HING AT AN EXTREMELY RAPID PACE.  CAVE PEOPLE---WATCH YA BACK!
<LI>I feel that the Browns and OJ should work out custody together.  Right now all that is important is the children.  They love their father and miss their mother and they need him.  I feel that the media has done a lot of damage to the justice system.  The TV coverage is good the media coverage is not necessary if we are able to watch and judge for ourselves.  The media needs to put themself in check.
<LI>Amazing that so many can easily consider him innocent.
<LI>The jury obviously did not understand their duty to deliberate (i.e., take some time to look at and discuss the evidence)  nor REASONABLE (as opposed to utterly fantastic) doubt"
<LI>"AND IT IS HE WHOM DORNS THE DOUBLE MASK AND SWINGS THE BRAZEN KNIFE, IT IS HE THAT LEADS HIS FELLOWS TO A DEEP DARKNESS" Qoute by Lance Ito when asked about COCHRAN.  
<LI>I think the people of our country need to get of OJ's back.  He's been found not guily beyond a reasonable doubt and that's that.
<LI>dissappointing
<LI>It was the second "Monkey Trial" of the century...except this time, the monkeys were on the jury!!
<LI>I  thin kthat this whole case is a bunch of bull shit I mean now tht it is over  they chould just let it be I mean they are turning this whole thing  into a racial issue which is really just piising me off they are putting this case on talk shows adn who 
<LI>It was the biggest miscarraige of justice I've ever seen.
<LI>NOW I CAN WATCH "DAYS" IN PEACE
<LI>The prosecution only brought this case to trial because their credibility was at a all time low, and garcettis political motives.
<LI>computers are so cool man, how do you get out of here?
<LI>I hope the US justice system learns from this fiasco
<LI>This perspective is from a second-year law student
<LI>if oj was innocent, defence did not infer it in their case
<LI>Trial was an abberation. No other signficance sociologically or with respect to the justice system.
<LI>I think the trial lasted too long.  I hope the civil suit isn't aired on television.  I think O.J. should get the kids, and everyone should leave them alone so they can go on with their lives!!!!!!!!!
<LI>wish I had discovered this area sooner.Still feel frustrated regarding the verdict.
<LI>The ultimate result is an increase in predjudical sentiment within the white community since he clearly got away with murder.
<LI>The information brought in during congial visits needs to be examined
<LI>Do Your Part to END RACISM!!
<LI>A disaster from the start.  The investigation of the crime scene was disorganized and unprofessional.  People in the Prosecuter's Office stated publicly that "O.J. is guilty" before ever reviewing any evidence and assembling their case.  The Police handling of matters was highly disorganized.  Maybe what both need to realize is that they can't wipe their asses with the Constitution and expect to win a case.
<LI>the car chase was a waste of time, the trial was a waste of time and teh whole thing was a waste of money.  A waste of tax payers moneis, a waste of private companies money and a waste of time for our nation.  OJ is a waste.
<LI>It's very sad that a brutal murderer got set free because of the jury's emotions!
<LI>only time will tell.  I hope he has trouble sleeping at night
<LI>GUILTY!!!
<LI>If this sort of thing happened elsewhere (not in LA, not in US), he would be frying right now.  Just come up to Canada and try to get away with that, baby.
<LI>THERE WASN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE, THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN UP SINCE THE BEGINNING.
<LI>We MUST prevent OJ from regaining his social & economic status.
<LI>The verdict wasn't about race, it was about money. Rich people can get away with murder.
<LI>Sad day for American justice. Will the feds prosecute O.J. for violation of civil rights? Or is that only for 'white' police officers? 
<LI>it was the worst circus seen created by the media
<LI>Justice could not, would not, and did not get served
<LI>It was a circus
<LI>Judges should pick jurors, not lawers
<LI>GUILTY!
<LI>As an African-American, I am in the minority because I believe that O.J. is guilty.  I agree with the verdict because I belive that O.J. was rich enough to get lawyers that could prove reasonable doubt.  Race, of course, played an issue in this case. Our society has not reached the point where race doesn't matter and it will be a long time before it does.  There have been many comments made about how race relations have been set back, but that doesn't have to happen. Based on previous comments in this 
urvey, it seems that whites are the ones who want to set relations back by blatantly using the "n" word.  As Rodney King once said, "Can't we all get along?"
<LI> A sad commentary on the judicial d  system
<LI>OJ is a murderer, black people are stupid, justice was not served. The time is nearing and black people do not stand a chance. Let the war begin.
<LI>In the United States, you can get all the "Reasonable Doubt" you can afford!
<LI>convinced me to deny ever seeing anything that might go to court for fear of what the lawyers would do to me. If i had seen the actual murder happen, I sure wouldn't tell anyone.  I have a business to run.  Besides, I'd probably be murdered if my testimony had helped get him convicted...not because he's black but because he's so popular and rich. 
<LI>the cops blew the case
<LI>LAPD proved total unprofessionalness. USA lacks, but needs a Sherlock Holmes
<LI>The trial was OK, but the aftermath is disgusting.
<LI>Ito should have taken control of this trial and made it into a trial of OJ Simpson instead of whatever it  was.  The closing statements for the defense were disgraceful.  Ito should have stopped it.
<LI>He's guilty, what else can I say?
<LI>I think justice was served...the prosecution didn't prove their case....there is more to the story.....will we ever learn the truth????
<LI>I think justice was survey...the prosecution didn't prove their case....there is more to the story.....will we ever learn the truth????
<LI>It was not just Furman but a shitty job in general by the LA PD detectives
<LI>I realy dont know.
<LI>I am OUTRAGED that race and racism are used as excuses for black's crimes, and that no matter what the evidence may show, there are always other blacks who feel the responsibility to bond with their race. If O.J. was white he would be in jail today, and rightfully so. It is now becoming very hard for many whites to be "colorblind"; I feel as though most blacks group me in with the rest of the whites they feel are "out to get them."   BUT...one too many times you cry wolf, and it loses its impact...How 
ill whites react to the next case involving actual racism?
<LI>The other reason for his aquittal was his celebrity and public persona - they just couldn't believe that O.J. could do such a thing - "he's such a hero and a great guy" (not a jury quote).
<LI>What an embrassment for blacks, if the verdict of a black person is "Guilty, they riot (i.e. Rodney King and the LA riots), but if a black person is found innocent they are so happy.  Didn't see any whites riotting.
<LI>There was Reasonable Doubt but the jury showed it was influenced by race by only being out three hours.
<LI>as a Canadian, I am glad our trials aren't sensationalized and are shorter, ie. Paul Bernardo
<LI>it sucks!
<LI>I can't believe the SOB go off!! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!!!
<LI>If he did do the murders, he has to live with the crime for the rest of his life.  And he has to make sure never to let anyone know he did the murders.  If he did not do the murders, so one did one helluva a good job framing him.  O.J still has to meet with one more judge -  God himself, he will be the ultimate sentence giver.
<LI>The crime has the characteristics and brutality of a homosaxually related murder. Goldman could have been the intended target of assailant or assailants.  Why will the prosecution keep saying that OJ is guilty when the jury has decided he is not? Will they only accept and respect their veredict if it's favorable to them, what kind of justice system works like that?
<LI>I just can't understand how a simple murder trial could get turned into a racial issue.  The whole thing was so stupid and blown completely out of proportion.  What a waste of money.
<LI>It's unfortunate that the result is so controversial.  The system in fact allows that OJ was found not guilty, and we MUST accept it.  However, without the explosive race issue, it likely would have resulted in a guilty verdict.  OJ did not, could not, and would not act as an innocent person throughout the entire episode; virtually all evidence confirmed him as the murderer.  An unemotional analysis of the evidence clearly convicts him.  The jury apparently focused their energies on finding, and justif
ing, doubt.  There exists no way to absolutely prove guilt or innocence - so our legal system provides all the tools for good lawyers to steer the jury toward the doubt issue.   Defense did their job, but it does not change the fact in any way that OJ did it.  The system worked as designed, a guilty man walked free.  I wonder - what would have happened if OJ were white and both victims black......
<LI>I hope the civil trials go better.
<LI>He still has to live with himself!
<LI>The only reason O.J. Simpson got an acquittal is because the defense played on the issue of race. The prosecution was not convincing enough. Mark Furhman damaged the credibility of the prosecution.  Yet, I do not think that he played a part in framing O.J. despite his racist beliefs.
<LI>the news made a mochery of the american people
<LI>What astonished me the most was the very low educational level of the jurors. I doubt that most of them were able to make critical judgement or understand the DNA evidence
<LI>Johnnie Cochrane should be held responsible for the fallout that will happen because of this trial.  OJ didn't represent black people everywhere in this trial.  The only group he could have represented would be the people who have money.  We all know that if any other black person from south-central LA would have been on trial with this much evidence they would have set them up long ago.  So a victory for blacks?  Only if Mark Fuhrman was the victim.
<LI>the verdict was a travesty of human justice, one which americans will never forget as a symbol of what happened all too often, to blacks and to whites. 
<LI>Just proves if you have money, you can get off!!
<LI>It's over!
<LI>I WANT TO KNOW WHY COCKRAN CAN DO THE THINGS HE DOES, BUT KNOW ONE HAS CALLED HIM A RACIST ! THE BLACK HAS FINALLY AWAKEN THE SLEEPING GIANT, MAY ALL BLACKMEN RUN FOR COVER. 
<LI>This trial did more to seperate the two races then any other incident to date
<LI>WAKE UP AMERICA ! THE ASIANS THAT HAVE RECENTLY COME TO AMERICA HAVE MADE SUCCESSES OF THE VENTURES, YOU DON'T SEE THEM GOING AROUND CRYING BECAUSE THEY ARE A MINORITY. THE BLACKS HAVE ALWAYS USED EXCUSES FOR THEIR FAILURES. POINT IN FACT: CLEAN CRIME FREE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE BECOME SLUMS AFTER THE POPULATIONS EXCEEDS 56% BLACKS. MEDICAL EXPENSES HAVE TRIPLED BECAUSE 93% OF BLACKS ARE REFUSING TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THEY HAVE DESTROYED THE WELFARE SYSTEM TO THE POINT OF CRUSHING THE MIDDLE CLASS.... I'M TI
ED OF THE BLACK EXCUSES, THEY BEEN HERE LONGER THAN MANY MINORITIES, BUT THEIR STILL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE. BETWEEN COCHRAN AND FURHMAN, I SADLY SAY THAT FURHMAN MAKES MORE SENSE !!!!!
<LI>Hopefully the American legal system will learn something from it. Also the LAPD!
<LI>What A Fucking Joke!!
<LI>we all know what this trail was about. We all know why he was set free. I hope that butcher NEVER is able to get back what he had. As for helping the black community, he never did before, get real do you think he will? He is all set to marry a white woman and to try to fit in the white society he was in before. You definitely won't see him in south central L.A. helping anyone. I will not suppoert anything that benefits that monster, I will avoid and boycott anything like that. Even found not guilty he 
s still a batterer, that cannot be shaken off as he tries to repair his image. I hope he never gets a moments peace for the rest of his life.
<LI>There is a great gulf between lawyers and the rest of us. I really don't understand their motivation to be so sleazy.
<LI>Was a sad excuse for a trial!!! - Waste of taxpayers' money. Now having read the comments of some seriously sad people I will further add the following.  It appears that the majority of America (african and white) has a chip on its very large shoulder - no-one appears to have weighed up the evidence.  Since we in the UK had limited coverage (albeit the little we saw far too much) there was not enough to convict OJ beyond reasonable doubt.  If this case had been heard within the British judicial system 
t would have not even reached court as our Crown Prosecution Service would have found that there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction.  The overall system in the US has only gone to prove that if you have enough money you can buy anything (not saying that OJ was guilty or innocent).  If it had been your ordinary Joe Bloggs in the street would he have stood a chance?  It appears that the white population decided long before the trial had commenced that OJ was guilty and black america decided he wa
 innocent.  Its time to step back and take a good long look at yourselves... it's about time everyone in the USA looked at people as people and not someone with a little or a lot of colour pigmentation!  USA should realise that they created their own judicial system and therefore they should live by its verdicts irrespective of whether they themselves agree with it.  On another matter, now that this sorry trial its over - why are people trying to re-try him - you know you can't try a man twice for the same
crime.  Has it ever occured to anyone that when the civil action is being heard that if the Goldman and the Brown's really thought OJ did it, his money would not be good enough, since afterall it would be blood money!!!
<LI>People should wake up! Reasonable doubt was abundant!!!!
<LI>color was the determining factor, the color was green!
<LI>Was a sad excuse for a trial!!! - Waste of taxpayers' money
<LI>It is better to let a guilty man go free than to imprison an innocent man.
<LI>The whole thing was a farce from the get-go.  There was a lack of information all around and the media had O.J. convicted from day one.  I haven't seen such shoddy judgement since Rodney King.
<LI>Finally, now even Black money can BUY aquittal-what justice!
<LI>Leave the guy alone, he's paid a miserable price!
<LI>I can only hope that this fiasco will lead to meaningfull reform of the system.
<LI>No effect, just mild amusement at watching others
<LI>Very interesting from start to finish!
<LI>bullshit
<LI>What a country--The almighty dollar wins again
<LI>O.J. sucks ass. 
<LI>OJ is a double murderer
<LI>The jury did not deliberate, black racism or ignorance of the civic duty, you choose which one.
<LI>When you get a jury from South-East LA and put them to listen to white lady and believe what she says or to listen and believe what a black man with the Nation of Islam sitting behind him says - who would you think they'd listen to and believe?
<LI>O.J. is a sleazy lying murdering piece of ****.  He should have everything he's put out return to him twofold.
<LI>I agree with the verdict, but I don't believe in OJ's innoncence
<LI>I feel he was guilty of HAVING them killed rather than killing them himself.
<LI>it was all bullshit
<LI>I cannot believe we can let a muderer, in my opinion, loose!  I guess, from now on, women will realy have to be afraid that men like this can actually get away with murder!  How sad, and how far have we stepped back in terms of the racial issues!  Everybody is against everybody, African-Americans think he's innocent, White's don't!  I myself am Mexican-American am trying not to be prejudice to all races.  I believe that there are stupid people in this world, OJ Simpson is one of them!  He has cause a l
t of pain, to his own family, his kids, the Brown's and Goldman's, but most of all America!  I'm just going to ignore the race issue by believing that there are still some good people in this world, and there are the OJ Simpsons!
<LI>What a bunch of bullshit... I can't believe America's come to this.
<LI>There is no question that the verdict was based on race, 9 black jurors??  COME ON!!! 
<LI>O.J. is guilty. What has happened to the value of life?
<LI>We can't simply move on. It is good to talk about the trial, and to learn from it.
<LI>Why is so hard for people to believe that police can frame a person, we only believe things about police when a nother police tells on them
<LI>I think it was a circus.  Even now the media is on OJ. I boycott anything with  OJ on . 
<LI>regardless of the result, we have to live with it
<LI>I kinda like the spelling, Johnnie CROCKrane
<LI>its finally over!=)
<LI>this trial was a joke!!
<LI>The Trial shows that Hollywood is incapable of producing anything more entertaining and that the news media is more interested in advertising revenues than reporting news.
<LI>O J is a cool cat!
<LI>We need to appreciate a good scandal
<LI>You call that American justice... What a joke!! 
<LI>NIGGER !!! Thats right I'm a loser, I've trashed you cities, riddled your streets with crime, ruined the Cadilac name, filled your battered women shelters, consist of 85% of those on welfare. I have a 3.92 g.p.a. now, you have to repect me. FUCK YOU!!!!
<LI>An interesting view into the American judicial system.
<LI>THEY HAVE TRASHED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM, THEY HAVE DESTROYED OUR INTER-CITIES, THE BLACK USES THE RACE CARD AT EVERY TURN. I SAY TO ALL YOU BLACKS, WE ARE TIRED OF YOUR CRY BABY ANTICS, NO ONE BELEIVES YOUR CRIES OF DISCRIMINATION ANYMORE. THE ASIANS, HISPANICS AND OTHER MINORITIES HAVE DONE WELL IN OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT COMPLAINTS. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU BLACKS !!!!!!!!!
<LI>I hope that two people who died, will rest in piece and who ever did it pays with life.
<LI>COCHRANS TYPE IS A DISGRACE TO THE HUMAN RACE, AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN I WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO SNUF HIM. WRITE THE N.A.A.C.P. AND COMPLAIN ABOUT COCHRAN ! 
<LI>NIGGER!!, what a shallow mind that thinks a word (Nigger) is the way to black America's Heart.  My father once told me the reason a person curses, is he desn't have enough mastery of the English language to fill in the blanks.  I'm, as white America puts it a "Nigger".  One question to white America, What do you think this word does to black America?  I'm 3 times the person an of you low life out there are, I graduated the U of MD with a 3.92 GPA in Computer Sci, I will complete my Masters in CS in 2 m
nths.  I would measure myself against any of you NIGGER haters out there, my IQ(195), wit, ability.  Call me what you like, it doesn't matter to me, I know I am a better person than YOU could EVER HOPE TO BE,  Live long and ROT in your hatred, while I prosper and control your society.
<LI>It makes me sick to think that we have stooped to bashing the jury.  We made the system... we should work WITH the system!

 would measure myself against any of you Nigger haters out there, my IQ (195), wit, ability.  Call me what you like, its doesn't matter to me, I know I am a better person than YOU could EVER HOPE.  Live Long and Rot in you hatred, while I prosper and control you society.
<LI>oj should be in jail
<LI>The jury acquitted Simpson for two reasons, racisim, and police abuse of authority.  
<LI>This bias bullshit, 1 nigger gets off, and white america goes bizerk.  How many white Maggots have raped, hung, burned, castrated, maimed, blacks and celebrated doing it.  Fuck off!
<LI>The morning the verdict was read, OJ had a smirk like he already knew the jury's decision.
<LI>It was just a circus by media to make $$$$$.  O.J. really did do it he just got aquitted because he had $$$$$.
<LI>This man should never "get his old life back".  If OJ or any of his lawyers appear in public, they should be publicly shunned, "booed" and humiliated.  Only the black community will accept him now, but he never wanted them, and still doesn't.  When they finally realize this, they will also turn against him.  I will enjoy watching this 2nd wave of piranhas tear apart the carcass.  This is what a murderer deserves.  Those who live by the sword will die by it.  
<LI>the whole trial was a joke.  the defense was unprofessional
<LI>Glad it's finally over.
<LI>WE NEED TO REFORM THE PROCESS OF JURY SELECTION.
<LI>The RACIST COCHRAN has set the race relations back 30 years. Don't blame THE JURY, Don't blame FURHMAN, Don't blame the LAPD. COCHRAN IS THE DOG OF DOGS, HE HAS USED THE RACE CARD FOR TEN YEARS NOW IN EACH OF HIS TRIALS. WAKE UP AMERICA ! WE MUST CASTORATE THIS DOG.  
<LI>everyone, put oj aside and get on with your lives
<LI>the verdit as a great travesty of justice
<LI>I won't support in any way shape or form anything or anyone who endorses "The Butcher of Brentwood"!
<LI>Just so participants of the poll know I am white, middle age female, and I never thought he had time to commit the crime.
<LI>It's scary that you need to be rich to get a fair trial
<LI>Travesty of justice!
<LI>The media was very biased against OJ
<LI>I hope Fred Goldman kills OJ. Run Juice, run!
<LI>OJ might be innocent but If he did it, which he did in my opinion, He has to live with himself. I HOPE HE DIES FROM HIS GUILTY CONSCIENCE!
<LI>If it was you or I, no one would care about this survey. It takes money!
<LI>Should have had a directed verdict, then jail the jurors.
<LI>While I do not agree with the verdict, I think that the trial has piqued my interest in law as a profession!
<LI>OJ,a double murderer, escaped a just verdict
<LI>Our current methods of Jury selection are ludicrous.  Lawyers should not only be unable to contest Jurors, but ideally jurors should observe trials from special screening rooms, unseen by the court participants, so that even the composition of a jury is unknown and cannot be used to the advantage of lawyers pleading a case.  Our current system only results in theatrics and juries overbrimming with the masses of the ignorant and the uninformed.  
<LI>I got sooo tired of it
<LI>very disappointed
<LI>Although I didn't watch the trial everyday, I don't the the prosecution proved anything beyond a reasonable doubt other than he beat his wife.
<LI>I LOVE OJ
<LI>keep tv out of the court rooms!!!!!!
<LI>I think that Maria Clark did a fantastic job and she was criticized too much.  She was very professional and didn't play up to the cameras as did the defense!!!!!
<LI>prosecution could have been more organized.
<LI>I think the news media did not present what really happened in court, thus we see the outrage.  I am 50/50 on if he did or not.
<LI>WHY DO YOU AMERICA STAND FOR THE BLACK PERSONS ACTIONS ? YOU LET HIM RIOT IN YOUR STREETS WHILE THEY RAPE YOUR WELFARE SYSTEM AND DESTRY YOUR INTER-CITIES. STAND UP AMERICA, DON'T LET THE BLACK DESTROY SUCH A GOOD COUNTRY !!!!!!
<LI>AS A AFRICAN AMERICAN, I AM OFFENDED BY THE WAY MY PEOPLE REACTED AFTER THE TRIAL. I AM THINKING THAT WE ARE THE RACIST IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE STARTED SOMETHING THAT WE WILL REGRET.
<LI>WHITW AMERICA IS ANGRY BECAUSE A BLACK MAN WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PLAY ON THE SAME TURF, WHITES HAVE BEEN PLAYING IN ALL ALONG.WHITE AMERICA HAS PROVEN TO ME THAT THEY STILL DON'T LIKE BLACK AMERICA.
<LI>I don't believe the jury weighed expert testimonies carefully.
<LI>IT WAS CLEAR AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER AND SEVERAL OF THE JURORS WERE INTERVEIWED THAT THEIR DECISION WAS RACIAL. I WILL BET $ 1,000,000 THAT NO MEMBER ON THE JURY HAD AN I.Q. GREATER THAN 80.
<LI>According to the white people, no black man is innocent, why don't you ckeck yourself out, I think it is the other way around. Those that keep saying hang him, you better prepare yourself for the blazing heat in hell.
<LI>none
<LI>every citizen should be equipped with such a defense team.
<LI>There are more things about Ron and Nicole than we are told. Maybe if other areas are investigated, the killer or killers could be found.
<LI>The wife-beater should have fried!!!
<LI>IT WAS A WAST OF TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I felt that the Court TV would have done better had they ren the trial for the complete court day , as I felt that they ended the day earlier than they should have.After all the advertisers paid big bucks because we were the revenue generating part of the deal. In addition I would like to see the TV stations do a follow-up on the courthouse family that we lived with for the past 15 months. What Ito, Clarke, Cochran etc are doing after the trial. After all, to me they are somewhat family, or at least as
ociates anyway. Great deal folks!!
<LI>If the media hadn't been so envolved, it all would have been over a long time ago.  I don't think either side provided "good" evidence.
<LI>Can't understand why procecution have hid something from us, can't understand Mr. Vanneda deminour and absence of clear answers to the questions which we all have.
<LI>I think the media should be ashamed, tell news don't interpret for ratings reasons.  I will make my own judgements.
<LI>In the big picture, millions are focusing on a the good & bad of maybe 30 family member (Brown,Simpson,Goldman).  What about the terrible travisties in the world.
<LI>I think the jury did a great job on the verdict considering the amount of sequestration time they had to undergo.  They made the only choice that they had enough evidence to show for.  I probrably would have given the same verdict with the amount of infor
<LI>O.J. got off because of his money.
<LI>I'm glad it's over!!
<LI>When there was slavery, there were whites who stood up and said 'This is wrong'.  Where are the rightious Blacks saying this verdict is a travesty of justice.
<LI>Unfortunately, it made a lot of people see the Blacks don't practice what they preach.  Their solidarity despite OJ's obvious guilt is the blindest kind of racism.   
<LI>The trial is less important than the effects it has on race relations.
<LI>The prosecution should first check out if the jury is dumb or not. If they are dumb, they should not pick them.
<LI>This was bad for black people everywhere.  They will pay the price for O.J.'s acquittal.
<LI>Fucking nigger
<LI>Closet KKK? Oh, I get it--if you're white, and are discusted about a black man getting aquited of a crime he obviously committed--you're a racist...but if you're black and are discusted at a white man getting aquitted of a crime he obviously committed...you're standing up for your rights.
<LI>Disillusioning
<LI>He did it!!!
<LI>This is really a silly poll.
<LI>OJ's a guilty spear chucker - I think we should hand him over to Mark Ferman to deal with
<LI>Every-one should boycott OJ
<LI>I can't believe how divided this county is. Someone in the jury made the comment that the domestic violence was not an issue (this was a PROVEN thing that OJ did) however, they did use race as an issue.....Go figure!!
<LI>Reading the comments from this survey and other "white people" is what has set race relations back (if there is such a thing) not the trial.  Some of you are closet KKK and that is why we are where we are today.  MAKE A CHANGE!
<LI>The jury had no other choice because the police has failed to do their job correctly.
<LI>OJ may not be in prison, but he's far from being a free man. In a couple of months, after he finds that he can't go out to restaurants, football/baseball games, when he can't go for a walk around the neightborhood, or even take his kids for an ice cream cone, because there's so much hatred of him and what he did, he'll wish he HAD been found guilty.
<LI>Sad Day in American Law
<LI>Why does everyone assume race was the deciding factor in the verdict.  There was reasonable doubt!  Also question 16 does not even mention that the children are OJ's as well as Nicole and since we don't know if he committed a crime he has every right to his children.  Last but certaintly not least why is justice only justice when it works in the favor of those white people.  I am not prejudice I love all peopel.  I believe because OJ is black and the evidence seemed to point toward him people made up t
eir minds that he was guilty until proven innocent instead of the other way around.  
<LI>White people should except the verdict. It's their system and it worked the way it's supposed to work. Just because it did not go your way doesn't mean it doesn't work. Their are a lot of problems with this system but, their was a reasonable doubt. I won't rule out the fact that their was a mountain of evidence against OJ. But their was also a significant amount of doubt. Me being a black man, if I was on the Jury, I don't think I would be able to look at myself in the mirror if I set a murderer free. 
n the same hand I don't think I would be able to look my self in the mirror If I sent a man to jail on questionable evidence. No Murder Weapon, No Eye Witness, DNA Evidence Accuracy Questionable, Detectives Integrity Shattered = A weak case. 
<LI>There was reasonable doubt

<LI>The Legal system is made for loopholes for many interest groups and agencies; this is just another case that has proven that.
<LI>defense caused more racial separataion than should have been
<LI>Money can buy anything.
<LI>I feel very disatisfied that OJ was let to walk away a free man.
<LI>how could the judice system let this happen his is guity and will have to settle that with the himself and god
<LI>Thank you Johnnie Cock-sucker for setting race relations back 35 years, and wife abuse 100 years. Asshole.
<LI>What a farce!
<LI>Best justice money can buy
<LI>RACIAL DIVISION IS DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY. HOW SAD!
<LI>The entire trial was turned from O.J. proving his innocence to the LAPD proving non-prejudicial justice.  If it were any other American we would not have made it through the now famous car chase to begin with and saved the Judicial system an enormous amount of money.
<LI>I believe this trial has set the race issue back at least 15 years and justice was not served !!!!!
<LI>The case was determined by jury selection.
<LI>I do not think that he committed this crime. Not enough time and not enough blood for one man to have done all this by himself.  I do hop they find the real killers.  I think when people give their opinions about whether or not he did it, they should say "I think he did it" and not "He did it".  They were not there.
<LI>OJ guilty 
<LI>If O.J. was white, Nicole and Ron were black, the verdict was not guilty, the Rodney King riots would have started all over again. 
<LI>they should send the jury to a DR. first, to check and see if they have a brain at all !!!!!!!!
<LI>The richer you are, the more likely you can commit any crime you want and get away with it!!!
<LI>OJ got away with murder/the verdict has damaged race relations
<LI>Listening to the Dershowitz's (sp) spins is irratating
<LI>The Trial has set race relations back 20 years, and justice back 100 years.
<LI>Will the Civil Suits by televisied?
<LI>jury members were afraid - so they acquited
<LI>I'm sure it's not over...
<LI>Thank God it's over!!!
<LI>The fifth pleaded by fuhrman put enough reasonable doubt to mak it impossible for a jury to convict.
<LI>It was very entertaining
<LI>If OJ would have wanted these individuals dead, I'm sure he's smart enough to hire a professional while he is somewhere else with an aliby. 
<LI>Makes me glad I'm Canadian - law is a matter of pride here.
<LI>Great entertainment value....
<LI>It's a shame that so much was made of this trial (all the time, money, mental resources, etc...) when there are so many other problems in our society that may not be as comercially appealing but really need to be addressed. 
<LI>Thank god for Civil Suits - He needs to pay...
<LI>My opinion is unpopular, but it IS how I feel
<LI>The reaction to the verdict by African-Americans, not the verdict itself, was the stunning outcome of this case. Apparently, A-A still harbor deep-seated resentment of whites despite the countries efforts towards equality.
<LI>the jury did the only thing they could - which sucks
<LI>If innocent, he should take a lie-detector test to prove it!
<LI>His race saved him.
<LI>I don't think OJ is dangerous, as long as you don't date him.  He did it, no doubt.  But as long as he's going to get off scott free, hopefully something good will come out of it.  Maybe OJ ought to run for office.  He has the perfect credentials: Total name recognition and he's gotten away with murder. Sounds like most politicians to me.
<LI>OJ is to the black race what Kennedy is to the white race:  Money buys your way out of jail, but not necessarily your freedom.
<LI>a joke
<LI>What else is there to say that hasn't already been said?
<LI>The jurors I've seen interviewed didn't have the intellectual tools to reach a reasoned verdict, so they reached an emotional one.
<LI>What surprise?  The man's a celebrity who is wealthy, and just like any other celebrity who is wealthy, he got off.  If the jury had no choice and he was more-the-obvious guilty?  Two years in prison, tops.  More likely, community service or some other light sentence.
<LI>It seems like black people use their race as an excuse.
<LI>The justice system does not work...as long as the person is rich that person will get off..ie(Will K. Smith, and his uncle Ted)
<LI>This is all we need; people making more decisions on the superficial basis of one's skin color and not the facts.
<LI>The trial was a hoax, a media circus!
<LI>The jury found him NOT GUILTY, not INNOCENT.  Deal with it.
<LI>The jury found him NOT GUILTY, not INNOCENT.  Deal with it.
<LI>the whole thing is a big farse
<LI>I'm glad that it is over.  And to those who are furious about the outcome.....GET OVER IT!!!!
<LI>justice was served!!
<LI>Over confident Garcetti should have used Santa Monica
<LI>GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY
<LI>I wish I could have heard every word, but I had to work.
<LI>Media had a negative impact evidenced by society vs jury verdict
<LI>Black Americans should be ashamed
<LI>Almost as bad as the Guildford 4 or the Birmingham 6
<LI>The LAPD's sloppiness, along with the Furhman factor, helped OJ the most. 
<LI>This was a mockery of the Justice system and a slap in the face to fair and impartial juries.
<LI>What a fucking joke! I hope Ron and Nicole come back like in Friday the 13th or Freddy Cruger and kill OJ
<LI>I love it!  It's better than "Friends"!!!
<LI>I believe that Johnny Cockran showed reasonable doubt but that is not why the jury let him off, They let him off becasue of the race issue.  They did the right thing, but not for the right reason.
<LI>Johnnie Cockroach compared Mark Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler.....well I'd compare Johnnie to Judas Iscariot....anything for a buck! 
<LI>Boycott NBC & General Electric!
<LI>Let's move on with our lives!
<LI>I really really hate that Clark bitch!
<LI>IT WAS A SHAME
<LI>The best thing we could do for the system and the victoms is BOYCOTT O.J. Sympsom's media blitz.
<LI>DO UNTO OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU . for what ever reason the jury set simpson free for murder of which i think he is innocent of. as for the wife beating i don't think there is a doubt that he is guilty. but all this buissness just shows that america did not outgrow the lynch mob mentality. womans groups want to hang him weather he did it or not. to further there cuase.if you get into trouble is this how you want peaple to react
<LI>I think that if the LAPD didn't have such poor investigative techniques that he would not have gotten off.
<LI>THE "NOT GUILTY" VERDICT FROM AN ALMOST ALL BLACK JURY, PROVES THAT A NIGGERS INTELLIGENCE IS ONLY ONE STEP ABOVE AN APES.
<LI>the outrage is on race, not on the verdict
<LI>A jury's verdict is good enough for me.  
<LI>if your'e rich and famous you can get away with any thing , even murder
<LI>OJ said to Fay Resneck at the funeral when she asked him "What happened?"...he said "I'm sorry, I just loved her too much". He also said "I'm sorry to other close friends". THAT IS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT!!  Then he told his other friend (the cop) that he refused to take a lie detector test because he had had dreams of "killing Nicole".  WAKE UP BLACK AMERICA! OF COURSE HE DID IT..DOESN'T IT BOTHER ANY OF YOU THAT YOU'RE MAKING A HERO OUT OF A MURDERER?
<LI>Only three people know who did it, and they're not talking!
<LI>THEY ARE HIS CHILDREN TOO, I'M NOT SAYING HE IS PERFECT BUT NOT A MURDER EITHER. OJ HAS ALL OF MY SUPPORT. IF GIVEN THE CHANCE I WOULD TELL HIM THAT AND YES I AM A WHITE FEMALE.
<LI>I think what happened here is this: Black people could not accept the fact that a black hero of theirs could do something so horrible. They (including the jury) completely ignored the evidence that showed OJ to be guilty. They ignored his drug problem, his violent temper, the fact that he was a WIFE BEATER and a man obsessed with having his own way. White people can be just as dumb. There are still millions of whites who 'worship' Elvis in the same manner. They completely ignore the fact that he was a 
errible husband, a lousy father, a drug addict, a spoiled rotten brat who threw violent tantrums when things didn't go his way...they ignore all that, and only see "ELVIS THE ENTERTAINER" and view him as a demi-god.  This just goes to show 2 things: (1) Image is everything, (2) the human race can be pretty damn deaf, dumb and blind when they want to be.
<LI>It verdict made me sick.
<LI>The longest saddest excuse for justice I've ever witnessed
<LI>You people need to get a life this survey waste your time and mine.  I just lost a whole 5 minutes of productivity by taking this stupid survey.  Have a great life
<LI>OJ definetely guilty
<LI>Face the System, found not Guilty.. everybody get a life now 
<LI>A shame to America
<LI>Great job by the defense! Hope they'll represent me if I ever should need them!!
<LI>The whole thing was ridiculous. It is possible that he did or did not fucking kill those people. I dont know and very few people still alive do know. One thing I do know is that our government and media control system are out to separate races to create further confusion and hatred among the masses, which encourages consumption, which the system profits from....Consume! Consume!! Don't believe the lies. Take back the power. 
<LI>Purely disgusted.
<LI>I did it.
<LI>In Texas, I think we'd say the boy had some hanging coming his way.
<LI>The trial has worsened race relations in the U.S.A.
<LI>I still can't believe something like this can happen in America !!!
<LI>In money we trust
<LI>I have lost all confidence in the American NEGRO
<LI>My faith in the jsutice system is shaken only because the prosecution proved to be so inept.
<LI>we will live with the fallout from this trial for years
<LI>I don't think that every one should put up such a big fuss on wether O.J. did it or not. God knows and will be the one and only juror in O.J.'s trial in heaven.
<LI>TRIAL WAS TOO LONG
<LI>How much solid evidence does it take to convict someone!!
<LI>If the LAPD was framing him,why didn't they take him more seriously about spousal abuse?  It doesn't wash. 
<LI>they should have hung that nigger!!!!
<LI>I think that this is the worst thing to happen to race relations in my life time
<LI>The statements that some of the jurors made after the trial, especially concerning their view of the irrelavence of the spousal abuse evidence, seems to question the practice of trial by a jury of one's peers.  With more and more sophisticated scientific and psychological evidence being presented at trials, a jury of one's peers cannot be expected to understand such evidence, and make a just verdict.
<LI>My real answer to #12 is that rich/famous people can *buy* reasonable doubt.  I never believed 12 people in LA could accept that wealth and fame do not mean you would not kill.
<LI>GUILTY!!!!
<LI>I'm white and I'm proud to say that I tihink O. J. is not guilty!
<LI>I feel for the children because they have lost their mother and nobody should have to go through life without their mother, and expecially if she was murdered it would be tuff.
<LI>what a joke.
<LI>TOO MUCH TIME WAS SPENT ACCUSING THE WRONG PERSON 
<LI>I, like many people, am just shocked and confused.  I'm not really sure which way I *really* believe now...
<LI>Money talks.  
<LI>THE JUICE IS LOOSE
<LI>boycott OJ
<LI>If you remove the issue of race, I believe that there was enough evidence to find reasonable doubt.  Further, civil suits constitute double jeapordy in my opinion and should be summarily dismissed.  I empathize with the families for their losses, but this
<LI>Whites are angry because a black man cot so of the "privilaged justice" reserved for themselves. They are being hyprocrites. Look at the menedez brothers. they kill their parents. Even if oj is guilty the jury found him not guilty..case done.. the whites do it all the time
<LI>How could the jury render a reasonable verdict in 3 hours??
<LI>race played no factor in the verdict-view evidence w/out bias.  I feel the media has done a great injustice to this country by perpetuating race as a motivating factor in this case.
<LI>Its a shame that OJ didn't go to Disney World!!!
<LI>We need to change the reasonable doubt law, and make it proponderence of the evidence
<LI>It was long, but interesting.  Good outcome
<LI>Your countrys justice system is a nullity.
<LI>this was the most pathetic trial ever
<LI>For those unhappy with the verdict, no one but the LAPD can be blaimed for giving the jury reasonable doubt with their sloppy procedures and lack of compitent detectives.   Oh... one more thing it's Johnnie Cochran, not Johnny Cochran.
<LI>the trial was a mokery to our justice system ,a joke  
<LI>The trial shold not be the focus.  The crime of murder should have been.  Also, the trial was a sad commentary on the even sorrier state of race relations in this country.
<LI>If you have lots of money, you can get away with anything!
<LI>That was quite a circus!
<LI>The jury system sucks!!!
<LI>I new he was innocent from the start
<LI>made me sick !!!!!
<LI>reveal the sign of crisis of law system
<LI>Justice Served? Christ! Johnny Cochran would defend Satan himself if he was paid enough bucks! I hope someone shoots OJ and his scumified "Dream Team"
<LI>Your #16 is ridiculous.  They are OJ's children too!  I am sick and tired of hearing the uproar about the acquittal.  No one seemed too upset about Emmitt Till's murder.  Finally justice is being served.  The prosecution did not prove their case and their
<LI>The outcome was exactly what was expected.  What, if anything, has OJ EVER done for the black community to deserve this type of support?  It seems to definitly be a case of brother looking out for brother here.
<LI>The jury did not give the right verdict or the wrong verdict......they gave THE VERDICT.....end of story 
<LI>I guess Justice isn't cheap.
