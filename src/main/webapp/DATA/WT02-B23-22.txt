 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>Of Altered States and Liberal Realities</H1>



<H4>

<DD><H3><CENTER>By Dale R. Trott<BR>
</CENTER></H3>

<P>
Over the years, I've heard many a conservative-minded talk show
host or columnist opine over the alternate reality that liberals
surely must reside within. That's a pretty bold claim even when
one considers the source of this theory.<BR>

<P>
To suggest that such a large percentage of the population is living
in an alternate reality sounds absurd, and even though I hold
a number of conservative ideals near and dear to my heart, it
was hard for me to imagine that anyone could be<I> that</I> out
of touch with reality. Now I'm not so sure.<BR>

<P>
In a recent interview with Ms. Magazine, Liberal Democrat Patricia Schroeder, Congresswoman from Colorado, stated the following with regard to the current state of talk radio in America:<BR>

<P>
"Now you can firehose people with your ideology 24 hours a day and never let the other side on. Listen to the <I>Rush Limbaugh Show</I> -- they don't air callers who disagree with him. It's made to sound like all America agrees with this idiot. Those of us who would like to answer can't because now there's no FCC requirement for balance."
<BR>

<P>
After hearing Schroeder whine about the lack of  balance on talk radio, it would be hard to argue with those who claim Schroeder and liberals like her are indeed living in some little-understood altered state of reality or perhaps even another planet in some distant solar system!
<BR>

<P>
I don't know if Ms. Schroeder expects Limbaugh to begin offering an "equal time" segment for liberal rebuttal in response to her dissatisfaction, but if that is the case, she most certainly <I>is</I> living in an altered state of reality. At times I must wonder if the entire city of Washington, D.C. exists in some unexplained state of altered reality, but I'll leave that subject for a future column.
<BR>

<P>
Beyond the absurdity of her presumed expectation of a rebuttal segment on the<I> Rush Limbaugh Show</I>, it is even more absurd for her to rail against the imbalance she perceives in conservative radio talk shows. Apparently Rep. Schroeder has conveniently forgotten that liberals practically own the big media outlets and the entire entertainment industry to boot.
<BR>

<P>Liberals have long denied the bias that is so obvious in the mainstream media today, but the once impenetrable fortress of denial they have protected themselves within is slowly crumbling around them. In a February 13 column in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, veteran CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg penned the following:
<BR>

<P>
"The old argument
that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias
is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore.
No, we don't sit around in dark corners and plan strategies on
how we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes
naturally to most reporters."<BR>

<P>
More recently, a poll of journalists released on April 17 by the
Freedom Forum should help us understand why the mainstream media
has a decidedly liberal agenda. Out of 139 journalists polled,
89 percent of them voted for Bill Clinton compared to four percent
that voted for George Bush. Two percent of them claimed to be
conservative and four percent of them said they were registered
Republicans. Fifty percent are registered Democrats, and 37 percent
are independents. Ninety-one percent describe themselves as liberal
or moderate.<BR>

<P>
This certainly comes as no surprise to those of us who have witnessed the development of the mainstream media over the past decade or so. One does not have to observe very long before their efforts to further the liberal agenda become obvious.
<BR>

<P>
From welfare to gun control, the "news" is skillfully slanted in a direction that must surely bring joy to the hearts of Bill Clinton, Patricia Schroeder and countless other liberals who probably look forward to the news every evening for a little lift. Especially if they have had a particularly difficult day dealing with those hateful conservatives up on the hill.
<BR>

<P>
Not to be outdone by the news media, the entertainment industry boasts its very own collection of slick liberal spin doctors. I'm sure this issue is also hotly contested by many liberals, but once again, one does not have to invest a great deal of time looking for the evidence of this bias. As a matter-of-fact, one does not have to be looking for it at all!
<BR>

<P>
As a rule, I do my best to avoid the seemingly endless supply of star-studded awards programs that seem to appear weekly on television these days. However, since my wife does watch them occasionally, I am sometimes exposed to these programs anyway. Call it "guilt by association" if you like. Most recently it was the Academy Awards that captured my attention as I entered our living room to discuss something with my wife.
<BR>

<P>
Had I not been aware of the program's title beforehand, I could have easily mistaken it for a Republican roast! I happened to walk in just in time to see Whoopi Goldberg and Robin Williams poke fun at the Republican presidential candidates. I'll admit to watching only a small portion of the program, but I would find it hard to believe that this particular portion was not representative of the political humor that delighted the assembled dignitaries throughout the entire production.
<BR>

<P>
I found it interesting -- but not surprising -- that Goldberg and Williams had nothing to say about President Clinton or his wife Hillary, despite the abundant supply of material that should have been available at the time. After all, with recent news regarding Whitewater and mysterious reappearing legal documents in the White House, it would seem that the Clintons would have presented a tempting target for Hollywood's political jokemeisters.
<BR>

<P>
Perhaps Whoopi and Robin subscribe to the time-honored adage that has been preached by countless grandmothers down through the years that suggests the following: "If you cannot say something good about someone, don't say anything at all." In this case, it is apparent that this courtesy applies only to fellow liberals.
<BR>

<P>
Don't think for a minute that the liberals in the entertainment industry reserve their wit and wisdom for adult audiences only. As we all now know, it truly "takes a village" and I don't think it is unreasonable to conclude that the entertainment industry is a very influential resident of our cyber-connected virtual village. This is evidenced by the number of hours many of today's kids spend parked in front of television programming, video games and computer games each and every day of the week.
<BR>

<P>
Not long ago, I joined my children in our living room as they watched a children's cartoon on a well-known children's cable television channel. This is the stuff that's touted as the kind of "quality" children's programming that is supposed to benefit the development of our young people.
<P>
Imagine my surprise when one of the characters on this particular cartoon made an unkind remark about Rush Limbaugh's weight!
<BR>

<P>
And to think that our president and his liberal pals had the nerve to get up in front of the television cameras and condemn conservative talk radio programs as "hate radio". If the<I> Rush Limbaugh Show</I> deserves to be labeled as "hate radio", I wonder how we might describe a children's cartoon that includes insensitive remarks about someone's weight. What kind of message will kids take away from a program like that? Might it suggest to them that it is okay to make fun of the gravitationally challenged?
<BR>

<P>
Apparently, the liberals reserve their politically incorrect and insensitive remarks for use only when discussing conservatives or any other "hateful" group or individual that does not happen to agree with their idealistic view of the universe. Perhaps this type of "hate speech" is only genuinely insensitive and hateful when it is used to describe a liberal.
<BR>

<P>
The good news is that more people than ever before are able to see through the flimsy veil of objectivity that the mainstream press carefully wraps around their daily output. After decades of a virtual monopoly on the dissemination of information, talk radio and the Internet are finally presenting the media giants with some formidable competition.
<BR>

<P>
It's safe money to bet that the news media, entertainment industry and political creatures from both sides of the aisle will be putting more and more pressure on the free exchange of information. We have already seen the modest beginnings of their attempt to control the Internet with the recent passage of the telecommunications bill.
<BR>

<P>
They now realize that a well-informed and well-connected electorate could constitute a genuine threat to status quo, and they will surely act to minimize that threat as quickly as possible. If we allow them to regulate this free exchange of information out of existence, we just may be giving up the best chance we have to put the power of this wayward government back in the hands of the people where it was truly intended to remain from the very beginning.
<BR>

<P> <P>
