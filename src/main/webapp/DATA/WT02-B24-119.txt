<h1>Alert 17:<br>ACIR to Vote on IDEA as an Unfunded Mandate</h1>
<p>From: Public Affairs Committee<br>
July 18, 1996
<p><b>Background</b><br>
The Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), established by 
the Unfunded Mandates Law of 1995, will vote on its final report to Congress 
on Tuesday, July 23, 1996. Despite the fact that civil rights laws and IDEA 
were exempted from the unfunded mandates, ACIR's initial report, which was 
issued in February, had recommended that the private right to legal action 
under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the IDEA be eliminated. Although 
the final report does not mention either the ADA or the private right to action
under IDEA, including the IDEA in a report on unfunded mandates is potentially 
very dangerous, particularly in view of the fact that the chances for a 
reauthorization of IDEA in the current Congress are dim and getting dimmer.

<p>The three recommendations on IDEA are:
<ul>
<li>Increase federal funding for IDEA to 40% of the excess cost
<li>Relieve state and local governments from "prescriptive administrative and 
    recordkeeping requirements".
<li>Increase the use of mediation and other forms of alternative disputes 
    resolution.
</ul>
<p>
LDA President Sandra Britt has written to all members of the Commission urging 
that IDEA be removed from the report because:
<ul>
<li>States clearly have the responsibility to provide an education to all their
children. Children which disabilities are entitled to the same educational 
opportunities as their non-disabled peers. The funding provided by IDEA is 
intended to help the states to provide those opportunities. The "prescriptive 
administrative and recordkeeping requirements" of the law are intended to 
ensure that federal funds are spent wisely for the purposes for which they were 
intended.<br>

<li>The report perpetuates the myth that IDEA is not a litigious law. LDA has 
no objection to the use of mediation as an alternative to due process because 
it benefits both children with learning disabilities and the school systems 
which serve them. However, children with disabilities and their families must 
retain the right to redress wrongs under the law.<br>

<li>Because IDEA is clearly exempt from the Unfunded Mandates LAW and because 
the reauthorization of IDEA now being considered by Congress addresses some of 
the concerns expressed in the ACIR report, LDA urges the Commission to remove 
all references to IDEA in its final report.
