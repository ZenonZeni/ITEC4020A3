<H3>1. Wind Power</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
The advancement of wind energy is a convincing success story. The wind 
industry is producing utility-scale turbines that are significantly less 
costly and far more reliable than earlier generation turbines. Newer 
turbines are routinely available for generation more than 95 percent of 
the time, and utility contracts for wind power have been signed recently 
for a levelized price of less than 4 cents per kilowatt-hour - a price 
that is competitive with fossil sources and cheaper than nuclear.<a href="#315" name="r315"> [ 315 ] </a>Wind 
has enormous advantages over fossil fuels, including minimal future costs 
subject to inflation<a href="#316" name="r316"> [ 316 ] </a>and low operating and maintenance costs.<a href="#317" name="r317"> [ 317 ] </a>Wind 
energy is one of the least costly sources of new electrical generation and 
is competitive with new fossil fuel-fired plants.<a href="#318" name="r318"> [ 318 ] </a>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>     Wind power has another advantage - its modularity. Wind turbines 
individually cost a fraction of what a conventional power plant costs, and 
a generator can install as many wind turbines as it needs, when it needs 
them, and with lead times of about one year.<a href="#319" name="r319"> [ 319 ] </a>
<p>     The cost of wind energy ranks well below all other energy sources 
when measuring rational, economic costs.<a href="#320" name="r320"> [ 320 ] </a>
<p>     In spite of wind energy's declining costs, the market still presents 
numerous barriers. As utilities turn to market mechanisms, such as 
bidding, to determine the type of power plants that will be built, wind 
energy's beneficial attributes are being ignored in the "dash to natural 
gas" - the mid-1990s fuel of choice.<a href="#321" name="r321"> [ 321 ] </a>The market should discount 
future cost projections of fossil fuel-fired technologies because of price 
volatility.<a href="#322" name="r322"> [ 322 ] </a><BR>
<p>     At the end of 1994, 1,717 megawatts of wind capacity had been 
installed in the United States, producing around 3.5 million 
megawatt-hours per year. (Using wind to provide 3.5 million megawatt-hours 
of U.S. generation avoids about 2.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions annually.<a href="#323" name="r323"> [ 323 ] </a> The bulk of this capacity was installed in the 
mid-to-late 1980s. Far greater growth of wind installations has occurred 
in foreign markets. Europe accounted for 80 percent of the wind industry's 
sales in 1993, and Germany alone accounted for nearly half of worldwide 
wind capacity installed in 1994. Worldwide grid-connected wind energy 
capacity was 3,657 megawatts at the end of 1994, and generated more than 6 
million megawatt-hours of electricity.<a href="#324" name="r324"> [ 324 ] </a>
<p>     The U.S. wind resource is large enough to supply more than 4.4 
billion megawatt-hours - more than 1.5 times the total amount of 
electricity used in the United States.<a href="#325" name="r325"> [ 325 ] </a>A 1990 Battelle Pacific 
Northwest Laboratory study concluded that available wind technology under 
tight land use restrictions could economically produce 20 percent of the 
electrical needs of the contiguous United States on just 0.6 percent of 
the land.<a href="#326" name="r326"> [ 326 ] </a>Although wind power (without storage) is an intermittent 
resource, meteorologists have become reasonably accurate in predicting the 
energy profile of a wind resource in sites with good wind data.<a href="#327" name="r327"> [ 327 ] </a>

 <p>     <A NAME="KenetechCorporation">Kenetech Corporation<a>.</B></I> Kenetech Corporation, based in 
San Francisco, was formed in 1986 as the holding company for <A NAME="U.S.Windpower,Inc.">U.S. Windpower, Inc.<a><a href="#328" name="r328"> [ 328 ] </a>Kenetech, with more than 800 employees, is the world's 
largest wind company. It manufacturers and sells one of the most advanced 
wind turbines in the world, the variable speed Model 33M-VS. This turbine 
delivers electricity at less than 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it 
economically competitive with traditional fossil-fuel energy sources. 
Variable-speed turbines capture a higher percentage of available energy 
than did earlier designs, and rotate faster as wind speeds pick up to 
maintain steady power output to the utility grid. Kenetech is the only 
U.S. wind turbine manufacturer that is producing utility-scale turbines on 
a volume basis. Kenetech operates an installed base of around 4,400 wind 
turbines, most of which are in the United States. <BR>
<p>    <p>      An example of one ongoing Kenetech project is the Sacramento 
Municipal Utility District (SMUD) five-megawatt wind project, which began 
operation in 1994 using Kenetech turbines. The project produced energy at 
4.3 cents per kilowatt-hour in its first year (non-inclusive of federal 
energy production incentive payments).<a href="#329" name="r329"> [ 329 ] </a>Kenetech provided SMUD with 
guarantees that its turbines would operate at 28 percent of capacity over 
two years and that the project will annually produce 121.7 
gigawatt-hours - which offsets 41,743 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
from California's average annual <BR>
generation.<a href="#330" name="r330"> [ 330 ] </a>SMUD has an option to expand the plant size to 100 
megawatts.<a href="#331" name="r331"> [ 331 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      Overall in California, Kenetech generated 659,131 megawatt-hours 
of electricity in 1993, offsetting 226,082 metric tons of carbon dioxide 
emissions that would otherwise have been generated by California's average 
mix.<a href="#332" name="r332"> [ 332 ] </a>
<B><I> <p>    <A NAME="FloWindCorporation">FloWind Corporation <a></B></I> FloWind, based in San 
Rafael, California, develops wind plants and manufactures and designs wind 
turbines. The company operates two wind farms with more than 860 turbines 
in the Altamont and Tehachapi Passes in California. FloWind pioneered 
commercial development of a vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT), and also 
has exclusive marketing rights to a 275-kilowatt horizontal axis turbine 
designed by Robert Lynette and Advanced Wind Turbine - the AWT-26. <BR>
<p>    <p>      During 1993, the company invested substantially in research and 
development for a new generation VAWT - a 17-meter "extended height to 
diameter" VAWT. FloWind began testing prototypes of this 300-kilowatt 
turbine in Tehachapi in early 1994 and plans to upgrade substantial 
portions of its two wind plants with the new turbine design. FloWind's 
VAWT design was developed in part with <A NAME="SandiaNationalLaboratories">Sandia National Laboratories<a>. Using 
a $3.2 million cost-shared research agreement with the DOE, FloWind 
conducted a study of possible advancements in the VAWT technology, and 
integrated a number of improvements that capture more wind energy and 
bring down costs.<a href="#333" name="r333"> [ 333 ] </a>Commercial production of the turbine is slated for 
1995. <BR>
<p>    <p>      FloWind has grown into a company with 100 employees and annual 
wind turbine sales of $66 million, including $47 million in sales to 
India.<a href="#334" name="r334"> [ 334 ] </a>The total installed capacity of the more than 860 turbines 
operated by FloWind is around 140 megawatts, including 94 megawatts from 
turbines it owns. In 1993, FloWind generated 170,499 megawatt-hours of 
electricity in California,<a href="#335" name="r335"> [ 335 ] </a>offsetting 58,481 metric tons of carbon 
dioxide emissions that otherwise would have been emitted by California's 
average generation mix.<a href="#336" name="r336"> [ 336 ] </a>P>
<B><I> <p>     <A NAME="ZondSystems,Inc.">Zond Systems, Inc.<a></B></I> Zond Systems, with 
headquarters in Tehachapi, California, is the second-largest producer of 
wind-generated electricity in the world. Zond's five operating wind 
facilities in California have a total generating capacity of about 260 
megawatts. The company also has designed the largest U.S.-made turbine, 
rated at 500 kilowatts. The 500 kilowatt turbine - the Z-40 -  is a 
three-bladed, upwind, 40-meter rotor diameter machine developed with 
assistance from the <A NAME="NationalRenewableEnergyLaboratory">National Renewable Energy Laboratory<a> Zond installed 
one Z-40 in Tehachapi Pass, California, in 1994. <BR>
<p>    <p>      In February 1994, the DOE agreed to provide Zond with a $1 
million grant under the government's Value Engineered Turbine Program. 
Zond will use the funds to produce a prototype Z-40, test it in the field 
and release it for commercial production. Zond says it plans to begin 
building its first wind-power plant with Z-40 turbines in 1995.<a href="#337" name="r337"> [ 337 ] </a><BR>
<p>    <p>      Zond generated 578,172 megawatt-hours of electricity in 
California in 1993,<a href="#338" name="r338"> [ 338 ] </a>which offset 198,313 metric tons of carbon dioxide

<P><A NAME="317"  HREF="#r317">317.</a> The cost of operating and maintaining wind turbines is about half a 
cent per kilowatt-hour. This is half the cost of coal and nuclear plant 
operations, maintenance, and fuel, and about one-third the cost of that 
for gas-fired plants. The installed capacity cost of new turbines in 
commercial-scale projects of 10 to 20 megawatts ranged from $800 to $1,000 
per kilowatt in 1994. The American Wind Energy Association expects that 
the industry will reduce installed costs to around $750 per kilowatt by 
the year 2000. <I>Id., </I>pp. 23-24, 262.<BR>
<P><A NAME="318"  HREF="#r318">318.</a> <I>Id., </I>p. 24. The difference in cost between decommissioning 
nuclear power plants and wind power plants is substantial, but often 
ignored. For example, decommissioning the damaged Unit 2 reactor at Three 
Mile Island will cost more than $1 billion when completed, nearly as much 
as it cost to build the plant. Overall, decommissioning nuclear plants 
will cost from $0.3 billion to as much as $3 billion per 1000-megawatt 
reactor in 1985 dollars, or $300 to $3,000 per kilowatt. Wind plants, in 
comparison, are sustainable, and can be upgraded indefinitely. If 
decommissioning were necessary for some reason, it would cost about $3,000 
to $5,500 per turbine, or $30 to $55 per kilowatt - at least six times 
less than nuclear. The turbine's salvage value would likely offset much of 
this. <I>Id.</I><BR>

could afford to pay as much as four times more in overnight construction 
costs for five-year lead-time plants than for 15-year lead-time plants." 
According to Oak Ridge National Laboratory, building a series of power 
plants with short lead times would cut the price of electricity 18 percent 
over the 15-year period considered, or 1.3 cents per kilowatt hour, 
relative to building one 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant over four 
years. <I>Id.</I>, pp. 24-25.<BR>

<P><A NAME="320"  HREF="#r320">320.</a> <I>Id., </I>p. 25. Michael DeAngelis and Sam Rashkin of the California 
Energy Commission's research and development office performed an analysis 
of the hidden costs associated with all electric generation sources, and 
concluded that oil combustion, nuclear fission, fuel cells, and coal have 
among the highest costs, while efficiency, wind, biomass, hydroelectric 
and solar thermal electric are among the lowest-cost technologies.<BR>
<P><A NAME="321"  HREF="#r321">321.</a> <I>Id. </I>A survey by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) 
found that competitive bidding in most states has a "systematic bias 
against renewables" because of the emphasis on using "proven" 
(traditional) technologies, the undervaluation of environmental costs, and 
the exclusion of fuel-price uncertainty for fossil fuel plants.<BR>
<P><A NAME="322"  HREF="#r322">322.</a> By de-emphasizing the price volatility of fossil fuels, the cost of 
energy for conventional energy sources appears lower in early years than 
that for technologies with high capital costs but low fuel costs, like 
those of renewables.  <I>Id.</I><BR>
