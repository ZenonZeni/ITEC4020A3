A new and well organized group of drug pushers have taken to the streets
of some of the world's major cities in an apparent attempt to sustain a
drug market that has felt the impact of over a decade of prevention efforts
worldwide. They have engaged communities in debating the legal aspects of
drug use and skillfully avoided any discussion around the consequences,
whether physical, emotional, or spiritual, of the user or their family and
friends. In so doing, they have managed to recruit some well respected citizens
in their drug promotion efforts. <BR>
<BR>
These pushers of the '90s call themselves &quot;Harm Reductionists,&quot;
an appropriately Orwellian title, considering their main pastime is the
promotion of &quot;responsible&quot; drug use among the world's young people.
They believe that primary prevention programs have failed in their efforts
to prevent drug use among young people and that legislators have wrongfully
declared drug users criminals. To the Harm Reductionists, drug use is a
normal part of adolescence, has always been practiced by humans, and will
always be a human form of expression. They say, therefore, that we should
teach young people how to use drugs responsibly, rather than be endlessly
frustrated in our attempts to stop drug use. <BR>
<BR>
Harm Reductionists point to a range of symptoms from this intolerance to
drug use in our culture. Prohibition is their choice weapon to impress upon
us the futility and negative consequences of drug criminalization. They
believe organized crime, corruption, the spread of disease (in particular
AIDS), and the massive drug cartels are the fruits of our labor when we
make drugs illegal in our society. Their claims are convincing to many and
they back them up further with impressive sounding surveys and research
coming out of prestigious educational institutions, failing to explain that
they conducted the surveys themselves and that their research has been challenged
by the medical community, health organizations and research foundations.
<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Harm Reductionists believe drug use is actually beneficial
to individuals and is an essential part of an adolescent's initiation into
adulthood. To them, drug use is a positive expression of a young person's
individuality and freedom to explore the limits of their mental, physical,
and spiritual being. To Harm Reductionists, society should grant this right
to explore without fear of moral judgment or imprisonment, while teaching
young people how far they can go on this flight to freedom. <BR>
<BR>
Harm Reductionists ignore the human face of drug addiction. They do not
frequent AA or NA meetings, nor do they visit outpatient wards or drug crisis
centers. Their world is the conference podium, curriculum committee, or
an office somewhere far from those other &quot;uneducated&quot; drug pushers.
Tragically, Harm Reductionists target the innocence of children. <BR>
<BR>
Beware the Harm Reductionists or Minimizers or any other variations of these
clever drug pushers. When they come to your hometown, as they surely will,
challenge them. Above all, remember that, despite their arguments, prevention
is working . . . the Harm Reduction movement is proof! <BR>
