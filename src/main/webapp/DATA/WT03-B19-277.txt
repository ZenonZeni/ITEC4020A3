The city of Castlemaine has significant manufacturing and engineering
industries, solidly based on companies that grew out of opportunities
on the gold fields in the 1850s.
<P>
Castlemaine and District is within Victoria's country growth corridor,
and towns in the district are among the fastest growing in Victoria.
</FONT>
<H2>Traditional strengths in industry</H2>
<P>
<img src="gifs2/castle1.gif" align=right>
Manufacturers of industrial pumps, motors, other engineering works
and processed meat have been remarkably resilient.  These manufacturers
have endured and prospered by adapting their production technologies
and catering to new markets.
<P>
Castle Bacon is the largest employer in Castlemaine and has one
of the largest food processing operations in the state.  The company
continues to grow and now employs about 700 people.  The company
is considering export possibilities for its bacon and ham products.
<P>
Castlemaine is a major centre for specialist vehicle modification
and restoration services.  Local businesses are producing a full
range of vehicle components.  Spin off activities, such as upholstery
and carriage restoration businesses, have developed.
<H2>New opportunities emerging</H2>
<P>
In addition to manufacturing, Castlemaine and District continues
to grow through significant agricultural, horticultural, forestry
and service industries.
<P>
Considerable research is being undertaken to explore the opportunities
presented by local apple orchards, and export of fresh apples
through Avalon Airport is being investigated.  Dried apple chips
and apple ice-cream are other value-added opportunities.  Water
chestnuts and many other agricultural products are being grown
on a trial basis.
<P>
Pine plantation timber is harvested in the district.  Speciality
hardwood timbers are also being processed at local mills, and
the area is developing a reputation for high quality furniture
making through many fledgling businesses.
<P>
In recent years, the regional economy has been strengthened by
the establishment and consolidation of major community service
industries in the district surrounding Castlemaine.
<P>
The $3.2 million Loddon Prison at Castlemaine directly employs
240 people and has replaced an historic prison.  The district
hosts similar facilities for youth and women at the towns of Malmsbury
and Maldon respectively.
<P>
The acute care hospital and the extended care hospital are large
regional employers.  A $16.3 million plan will consolidate two
major health providers at one site.
<H2>Infrastructure and incentives</H2>

<P>
Castlemaine is well located as an industrial centre.  It is in
central Victoria, 120 kilometres from Melbourne.
<P>
The city enjoys excellent access to Melbourne by road and rail.
 The northern rail line from Melbourne to Bendigo passes through
the city, and the Port of Melbourne is just under two hours away.
 The Port of Geelong is about two hours away by road or rail.
<P>
The district maintains numerous local
and interstate transport services.  It offers community and education
services such as health and welfare, education and cultural activities
servicing a large rural community.  Over 740 registered businesses
serve the city and the surrounding districts of Maldon, Newstead
and Metcalfe.
<P>
Castlemaine's water supply is well equipped to meet demands from
new development.  Sewerage and water disposal meets existing and
anticipated demands.

<H2>Skilled workforce in supportive environment</H2>

<P>
Castlemaine and District offers the investor a stable and well
trained workforce.  The district has skilled and trained personnel
experienced in engineering and manufacturing industries.
<P>
Castlemaine offers tangible incentives to business to locate there.
 The city and surrounding municipalities have set aside ample
industrial land for future developments, and retain a very entrepreneurial
attitude to new development.
<P>
Industrial land is available just one kilometre from Castlemaine's
business district.  Wesley Hill Industrial Estate offers fully
serviced land zoned &quot;light industrial general&quot; for development.
 Blocks of industrial land vary in size and are priced very competitively.
<P>
The Winters Flat Industrial Estate, which is also fully serviced,
offers development opportunities for industries zoned &quot;general/offensive&quot;.  
In addition to these estates, a large quantity of
land is zoned industrial.
<H2>Attractions being enhanced</H2>

<P>
Tourism facilities in the district are developing at breakneck
pace.  The district has a significant goldrush history and a number
of classic attractions including Castlemaine Gaol and the Castlemaine 
Market, which has been restored.
<P>
The biennial ten-day Castlemaine State Festival of the Arts is
held in November and attracts 100,000 visitors.  Castlemaine maintains
many historic gardens, including a unique Botanical Garden.  An
excellent collection of Australian art can be found at the Castlemaine
Art Gallery and Museum.
<P>
The Castlemaine/Maldon Steam Railway Preservation Society operates
a tourist steam railway.  Stage one of a new $3.3 million steam
railway project has been completed, and plans for a world class
railway museum and steam travel network are in place.
