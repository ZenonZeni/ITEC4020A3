<H2>TENNCARE Fixes Problems</H2>
<HR>
Tennessee's state-based health care reform program has been in effect for less than a full year.  It has already been through severe implementation strains in implementing services to persons with severe and persistent mental illness (spmi).
<P>
The Tennessee Alliance for the Mentally Ill (TAMI) has been active throughout this transition, maintaining communication with the legislature, the governor, and his administration to be sure that the needs of persons with spmi are met.  Gradually the various problems in the implementation of this program are being overcome.
<P>
TennCare is at its core a Medicaid program operating under a waiver from the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to the state of Tennessee.  The federal law that defines Medicaid contains provisions that permit "waiving" of exact compliance with all its details so that a state con operate the program more flexibly than the original law specifies.
<P>
The driving motivation for operating the Medicaid program differently is the opportunity to control overall costs, to cover populations Medicaid traditionally does not consider eligible, and to support necessary services outside the bounds of traditional medical insurance programs.  Tennessee targeted all of these objectives in its development of TennCare. 
<P>
Persons who were uninsured or uninsurable have been added to the list of those already served through Medicaid.  Individuals have the opportunity to choose one of several managed care organizations (MCOs).  The list of available providers depends on this choice, so some persons may have to change doctors.  (See managed care article, this issue.)  Providers may lost some of their previous Medicaid patients.  the Tennessee Medical association brought suit to halt TennCare (not precisely on these grounds), but lost in court.
<P>
For the past several years TAMI has worked actively with the Tennessee Department of Mental Health (DMH) and with consumers and providers to implement the goals of PL 99-660.  The federally required planning council took a strong hand in the development of a master plan for services to persons with spmi.  This plan called for an ambitious array of new community services funded by making significant reductions in the number of inpatient institute beds available.
<P>
When plans for TennCare were first announced, services for persons with spmi were not to be included.  Funds were to be "carved out" so that DMH would administer them, and services would continue to be improved as prescribed by the master plan.  HCFA, however, found the state's matching funds to be insufficient, and they required the DMH dollars to be transferred to TennCare before the waiver would be granted. 
<P>
At the same time the state's agreements with the MCOs were modified to require them to contract with DMH to provide services for each person with spmi.  DMH would presumable continue to support those community providers (CMHCs and other agencies) that had been expanding services under the master plan.
<P>
In several conferences with state administration officials, TAMI was assured that the expansion of services to persons with spmi would continue under TennCare.  But faced with a change of administrations after the 1994 elections, TAMI decided to put legislative force behind these assurances.  They introduced legislation that restated the special status of persons with spmi and the community services that they require. 
<P>
The bill ultimately passed both chambers of the legislature without a single dissenting vote.  The resulting statute defines the role of DMH in identifying individuals with spmi, specifying services, setting standards for these services, and evaluating the results based on outcomes for the persons involved.
<P>
TennCare is still in flux.  Most of MCOs have not yet signed the contracts that would require them to pay DMH for services, so the administration has been providing money to DMH from a special fund.  Recently the governor announced a 28 percent increase in the per capita funding to the MCOs that will be tied to their participation in model plans for services to persons with spmi.
<P>
The experience in Tennessee has shown that, even when progress appears to have been made, families cannot relax and assume that it will continue.  In ongoing dialogue with DMH, the legislature and administration, and with the providers, TAMI keeps reminding all concerned of the effectiveness of good services for persons with spmi.
