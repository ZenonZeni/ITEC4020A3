Newsletter Profile</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>John Beloff</FONT></P>

<P>Occasionally there comes to VESS a rock upon which the future rests
and grows. One such rock is John Beloff. A psychologist with a deep interest
in philosophy, he was drawn to the v.e. debate through his interest in
psychical research (a subject on which he is now considered an authority).
&quot;Both topics put one on one's metal to prove one's position,&quot;
he says. Beloff claims he hates quarrels but enjoys disputes: &quot;If
you make enemies you can't have a dispute; rather than denouncing them
loudly, it makes more sense to persuade those opposed to euthanasia by
the sweet light of reason.&quot;</P>

<P>In his thirteen years in the movement, Beloff has commanded world-wide
respect and affection. On the committee, he has been Chairman and Treasurer,
and his years as the former were marked by a harmony and absence of the
opposing factions so common to committees. He developed the Newsletter
into a regular and respected publication, fuelled by articles from a wide
range of eminent speakers and writers. When there were no funds, Beloff
would hold meetings in his own house. But his work has not been limited
to extensive public talks. He has written extensively on v.e. and has regularly
lectured to medical students about it at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital.
Unlike most committee members, Beloff however has been able to work at
all levels, including the actual day-to-day work in a campaign organisation.
For his efforts in manning the VESS Office twice a week, he was given the
working appellation Honorary Secretary, backing up the work of the paid
staff by contributing voluntary assistance on a regular, reliable basis.</P>

<P>At the end of one of the longest standing commitments to VESS, John
Beloff will this year be resigning from active committee work and from
the editing of the Newsletter, not from disillusionment but with the feeling
that VESS is in safe hands and that he has served long enough. Now in his
76th year, a humanist who draws strength from the lives of great people
he admires, what advice would Beloff offer those that keep up the struggle?
&quot;Don't lose heart, you are bound to have disappointments. Keep plugging
at it!&quot;</P>

<P><I>A new article by John Beloff appears in the next issue of VESS Newsletter.</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>John Beloff - writings on v.e can be found in VESS Newsletter,
eg Jan 1988, Do We Have a Duty to Die? Published work also includes Do
We Have a Right to Die? in Perspectives on Death and Dying, Cross-Cultural
and Multidisciplinary Views. A biographical profile can be found in VESS
Newsletter April 1985. &nbsp;</FONT></P>
