In 1995 CI launched a comprehensive, three-year program to bolster
the Tambopata Candamo Reserved Zone, a 1.5 million hectare reserve
in the Peruvian Amazon.  Called &quot;Conservation Based Development
in Tambopata,&quot; or PRODESCOT, this effort comprises 16 projects
and has received funding from USAID, the Peruvian government,
and several foundations.  PRODESCOT projects underway include:
 
<P>
<H4>Land Titling and Mapping  </H4>

<P>CI used five socioeconomic surveys
in different areas to provide baseline data, point up potential
land conflicts, and establish a working relationship with local
communities.   CI financed the field work that enabled the Pukirieri
Indians to officially title their land with the Peruvian government,
so  they will be better able to fend off incursions from colonists
and miners.  And CI has been helping FADEMAD, the Madre de Dio
Farmer's Union, to collect data on soil, topography and vegetation
in more than 28 communities in and around Tambopata.  CI is organizing
the data through its computer software, CISIG, and is generating
sophisticated maps to help farmers choose economically attractive
and ecologically benign farming practices. 

<P><H4>Monitoring and Sustainable
Use of Natural Resources</H4>

<P>CI has trained local inhabitants and
park guards in seven areas in Tambopata in natural resource monitoring.
 This effort is the first in Tambopata to collect long-term data
needed for making informed decisions about natural resource management.
         

<P><H4><A HREF="../c-c_prog/consent2.htm">Conservation Enterprise</A> </H4>

<P>In the 18 months since CI financed
the purchase of a Brazil nut processing plant in Tambopata, we
have developed marketing arrangements that will ensure collectors
a source of income.   With orders from nationally known restaurants
like Subway -- the world's largest cold-sandwich chain -- and
Hard Rock Cafe, millions of Brazil nuts are now exported from
Puerto Maldonado to outlets in the United States. </BLOCKQUOTE>
