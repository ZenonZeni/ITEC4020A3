New Ozone Depleter Suit to be Filed

The Environmental Law Foundation (ELF), U.S. Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG), Earthday 2000 and Ozone Action will file suit 
January 6, 1996, against refrigerator manufacturers Maytag and Sanyo 
and their retailers Montgomery Ward, Circuit City and Basic Living 
Products. The suit alleges that the parties are in violation of the 
Clean Air Act in failing to label products manufactured with and 
containing CFCs.

The Clean Air Act states that all products containing or
manufactured with CFC must be labeled to warn consumers that the
chlorfluorocarbons are harmful to public health and the environment.  
Manufacturers Amana, GE and Whirlpool replaced CFCs with HCFCs in 
their refrigerators. As a result of another recent settlement with 
ELF, Ozone Action and Earthday 2000, these three manufacturers are 
required to halt all advertising that their HCFC refrigerators are 
"ozone free" or "CFC free."

According to ELF associate attorney Christine Mailloux, "The
CFC-containing refrigerators sold by Maytag and Sanyo pose far more
of a public threat than those containing HCFCs. Especially with 
other manufacturers selling HCFC-based models in the same stores, it 
is imperative that Maytag, Sanyo and their retailers comply with 
federal law to help consumers make more environmentally conscious 
decisions."

Industry Urges Contractors to Make Phaseout Plans

As the CFC phaseout takes effect, heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning industry contractors are being urged to make good on
their New Year's resolutions to start a retrofit/replacement program 
and to do it now.

Even though the use of equipment using CFCs is still legitimate, the 
cost of the refrigerant will continue to climb as time passes.  End 
users who have not looked at their options for phasing out equipment 
that uses CFCs will "have to think about the future," says Tom 
Crane, manager of communications for fluorine products of 
AlliedSignal Chemicals.

Melody Dixon-Brown, marketing communications program manager for
DuPont Fluoro-products warns that complacency is the major problem.
"It's prudent to have a transition plan," she said.  At the 
beginning of 1996, Dixon-Brown estimates that three million 
commercial refrigeration systems and 67,000 centrifugal chillers in 
the U.S. will still operate on CFCs, representing $135 billion of 
refrigeration and a/c equipment.

Dixon-Brown predicts that those still operating CFC-using products
will begin running into serious shortages within two to five years.
Speaking for Elf Atochem, Harold Lamb, business manager for 
refrigerants is not so sanguine: "I suspect we'll see spot shortages 
during the next year," said Lamb, who predicts shortages may become 
acute by 1997.  The tax on CFCs in the U.S. is now $5.35 per pound 
and will rise again in 1996.

Supermarkets in particular need to investigate options after taking
inventory of their existing equipment and its projected life,
manufacturers advise.  Retrofitting can be expensive but even 
changing to the use of more costly HFCs over HCFCs makes sense when 
equipment can expect a long service life since the refrigerant is 
not due to be phased out.  In some cases it will, in the long run, 
be less expensive to replace equipment entirely, the industry 
advises.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and DuPont 
suggest that the time to convince customers to switch to alternative 
refrigerants is during routine service jobs.

DuPont Says It Will Phase Out HCFCs 10 Years Early

DuPont, in an effort to stem criticism of its production of ozone
destroying products, says it will phase out HCFCs 10 years earlier
than the Montreal Protocol requires.

Earl Clark, senior refrigerant engineer for the company's CFC 
Retrofit Program announced the plan at the Mechanical Service 
Contractors of America's 10th annual conference in San Antonio 
recently.  Under the Protocol, a 100 percent phaseout of HCFC 
production is called for by 2030.  DuPont says it will discontinue 
sale of R-22 in new equipment by January 1, 2020.  The company, 
according to Clark, is working on an "aggressive industry program 
for R-22 replacements" to be in use by that date.

The gradual phaseout planned from 1996 through 2030 will probably be 
accomplished in Europe by 2015, Clark said.  The Clean Air Act now
says that a loss of 15 percent of HCFCs used in industrial air 
conditioning units of 50 pounds or more constitutes a violation and 
that fines of up to 25,000 per day may be levied by the EPA.

DuPont remains an advocate of HCFC in centrifugal and screw
chillers, however, along with residential air conditioners,
commercial and transport refrigeration and in heat pumps.  DuPont 
says advantages of R-22 include low toxicity and  ozone depletion 
potential (ODP) 20 times lower than R-11 or R-12.

HCFC-123, said Clark, is vital to DuPont's success, and points out
that its ODP and global warming potential (GWP) are far lower than
any other refrigerant.  The company also revealed that a two-year 
inhalation study completed in 1991 indicated that the benign tumors 
found in lab animals had "little relevance to man."  HCFC-123 is 
DuPont's replacement for R-11 since their operating characteristics 
are similar and the same lubricants can be used.

DuPont is now producing HFC-134a as its replacement for R-12 and
R-500 in centrifugal and screw chillers.  The product's ODP and GWP
are 0.0 and 0.28 compared with R-12's ODP OF 1.0 and its GWP of 3.0.
