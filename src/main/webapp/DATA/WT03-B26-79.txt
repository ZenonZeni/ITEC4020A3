<B>3. THREAD COMPONENT TASKS<BR>
<BR>
</B>For the initial Tasks defined below as components of the primary initial
EOC Thread, the selected data stream will be AVHRR, GMS Pathfinder and Landsat
TM. However, the approach set out below and in the flowchart is generic
and will not be limited to these examples in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3.1 Instrumentation<BR>
</B><BR>
The EOC will develop an information system pointing to CSIRO capacity in
field instrumentation as well as develop a common, well managed instrument
pool (including calibration facilities)<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milestones:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Central Pool developed<BR>
calibration data base set up and maintained<BR>
Standards for field methods documented<BR>
Instruments &amp; site Information system in place</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Task Group:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Predecessor Task(s):</B> [Existing Base at DWR, DEM, ML and
DAR] <BR>
<B>Successor Task(s):</B> Calibration, Scene Brightness, Validation Missions</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3.2 Calibration<BR>
</B><BR>
Current and selected new calibration sites based on land and marine targets
are being developed collaboratively and used to establish base consistency
for AVHRR, GMS Pathfinder and Landsat TM satellite data in the short term
and provide a base for future EnvSat calibration operations.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milestones:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Invariant target sites investigated &amp; selected<BR>
marine site(s) selected (thermal and visible)<BR>
instrumentation in place<BR>
best practice campaigns planned and executed</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Task Group:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><BR>
<B>Predecessor Task(s):</B> Instrumentation<BR>
<B>Successor Task(s):</B> Algorithms</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3.3 Scene Brightness<BR>
</B><BR>
The issue of scene modelling and scene physics impacts on all scales and
is being addressed both empirically and from a scene physics base. Using
extensive high resolution data from airborne video and aerial photography
as well as ground based methods, it will be established if there is a consistent
'typology' of landcover BRDF in Australia. It will also be established what
is the current most practical approach to BRDF modelling and scene correction.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milestones:</B>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Tests of empirical vs kernel approach using existing data (include.
airborne video)<BR>
instrumentation and techniques for field measurement established<BR>
Landcover BRDF consistency investigated<BR>
Potential BRDF typology of landscapes established<BR>
atmospheric and sensor measurement model effects investigated at calibration
and validation sites</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Task Group:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Predecessor Task(s):</B> Instrumentation<BR>
<B>Successor Task(s):</B> Algorithms &amp; Processing</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3.4 Validation Missions<BR>
</B><BR>
Selected missions are being planned that validate selected algorithms, calibrations
and products. Missions will be coordinated to establish protocols and tools
for the assessment and maintenance of product quality.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milestones:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Field sites and instrumentation in place<BR>
Integrated field and airborne methods established<BR>
Marine targets established for thermal, visible &amp; radar validation selected<BR>
Operational validations made<BR>
comparisons of fixed site and campaign techniques</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Task Group:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Predecessor Task(s):</B> Instrumentation<BR>
<B>Successor Task(s):</B> Algorithms &amp; Processing</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3.5 Data Base of example Data<BR>
</B><BR>
(Includes ALRDC operations with USGS). Base tools in place as well as operational
archiving for the ALRDC and ML 'Marine DAAC' Archives (eg IDN, IMS). Establish
best tools for archive, browse, storage &amp; retrieval. Issues of reception
and communications can be addressed here but a program will only be established
in the longer term.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milestones:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>IMS and IDN installation completed and databases populated<BR>
Link to AEON established (if link established)<BR>
Market survey of potential users to establish best selections of features<BR>
Common tools and formats established at CSIRO reception and research 'DAAC'
archives</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Task Group:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Predecessor Task(s):</B> Nil<BR>
<B>Successor Task(s):</B> Data Management &amp; Communication</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3.6 Data management &amp; communication<BR>
</B><BR>
Demonstrations of operational data management and communication will be
coordinated with other Tasks. Selected streams provide the means to test
and establish best tools for storage and retrieval as well as interface
to algorithms and product output.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milestones:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Interface to algorithms established<BR>
Product throughput tests of selected data series<BR>
Product quality control tools established and demonstrated<BR>
Advanced data communications tools demonstrated</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Task Group:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Predecessor Task(s):</B> Data Base<BR>
<B>Successor Task(s):</B> Algorithms &amp; Processing</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3.7 Algorithms and processing<BR>
</B><BR>
A common set of software tools and best (SoS or State of Science) selections
of algorithms for processing will be established and promoted among CSIRO
and collaborating groups. The set selected will be the base sequence in
the product trials and the selections will be documented as an AMTBD (Algorithms
&amp; Methods Technical Basis Document(s)). Methods include field techniques
and laboratory practice as well.<BR>
<BR>
As a basis, the techniques covered will include choices for: Navigation,
[cloud clearing], mosaicking, atmospheric correction, BRDF allowance &amp;
balancing, thermal region atmospheric correction, LST and SST algorithms
and some data integration.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milestones:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>AMTBD documenting SoS algorithms for consistent &amp; standardised
series<BR>
Comparative selection and implementation<BR>
Trials on data series for AVHRR, GMS Pathfinder &amp; Landsat TM<BR>
Documentation of algorithms &amp; (limited) publication</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Task Group:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Predecessor Task(s):</B> Calibration, Scene Brightness, Validation,
Data Management<BR>
<B>Successor Task(s):</B> Product Presentation, Quality &amp; Standards</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>3.8 Product presentation, quality &amp; standards</B><BR>
For selected data streams of AVHRR, GMS Pathfinder and Landsat TM (in the
short term with other data types into the future) provide demonstrations
of product quality that results from coordinated generic processing Tasks
and the collaboration of CSIRO best teams.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milestones:</B> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>Present example products<BR>
Establish criteria for accuracy and performance with users<BR>
