<H3><CENTER><A NAME=Supreme>Surrogacy Recognized As Parenting
Option</A><BR>Parental Rights Upheld by U.S. Supreme Court</CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>In a case of paramount importance to the infertile community, the Supreme
Court has let stand a California decision that establishes the biological
or intended parents in a surrogate arrangement as the legal parents of any
child born from such an arrangement.
<P>The court also upheld that the contract employed by the Center For Surrogate
Parenting between surrogates and the intended parents is legally enforceable.
Finally, the higher court ruled that surrogate parenting is not against
California public policy.
<P>By refusing to hear a challenge to existing laws, the U.S. Supreme Court
has concurred with the California Supreme Court that a gestational surrogate
has no rights as a mother and cannot claim parental rights. Although the
rulings were only applied to gestational surrogate agreements, the decisions
may also impact agreements whereby the surrogate is both the genetic and
birth mother since in both types of arrangements the "intent" is identical:
to provide the infertile couple with a child.
<P>The rulings arose from the case of Anna Johnson vs. Mark and Crispina
Calvert. Ms. Johnson had agreed to carry the genetic child of the Calvert's
and then attempted to claim parental rights. Although the parties were not
in the Center's program, the Calvert's did use a contract prepared by the
Center. It was this contract specifically that was ruled enforceable. This
case redefines parental rights, reinforces surrogacy arrangements and once
again establishes California as a leader in expanding procreative rights
for infertile couples.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=study>Comprehensive Study of Gestational Surrogate Transfers
Now Completed</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The Center For Surrogate Parenting has completed studying 294 gestational
surrogacy transfers that involved 111 Center clients between 1986 and 1993.
This is the largest number of cases analyzed at one time. Clients studied
included those who supplied fresh embryos and frozen embryos and surrogates
who underwent IVF or ZIFT.
<P>The overall full-term or ongoing pregnancy rate for all clients was 26%.
As with other studies, the rate for women under 40 using fresh embryos was
higher, 28%, than those for women over 41 which was 6%. Although the statistics
for women over 40 using frozen embryos was actually higher than those using
fresh, 12% vs. 6%, the study showed that those women undergoing fresh transfers
were much older, up to 48 years old, than those using frozen embryos.
<P>The Center conducted the study in response to the most frequently asked
question: is IVF more successful with a younger uterus even if the eggs are
older? The overall gestational surrogate success rate, 26%, for full-term
or ongoing pregnancy is higher than the overall IVF rate. But the results
are still somewhat inconclusive and some, such as the ZIFT results which
show a 35% success rate for women under 41, are inconsistent with other studies.
<P>The study found that the majority of pregnancies, 51 out of 60, occurred
by the second attempt. Eleven out of the 60 were multiple births.
<P>It was also found that the miscarriage rate for gestational surrogates,
26%, was similar to the miscarriage rate for women over 35 in the general
population. Most studies show that the miscarriage rate for women under 35
is 20%.
<P>The Center's clients participating in the study were patients of 18 different
physicians who performed the actual IVF and ZIFT procedures.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=questions>Before You Begin: Questions to Ask Concerning
Surrogacy</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The Center For Surrogate Parenting offers a full range of psychological
counseling for surrogate mothers, egg donors and prospective parents to help
them decide if surrogacy is the best way for them to build, or help someone
else build, a family. Because of its careful screening and on-going counseling,
legal coordination and guidance services, the Center has a perfect 1.5-year
record of all parties fulfilling their agreements.
<P>Before entering any surrogacy program, consider the following:<BR>
<OL><LI>Does the program recruit its own surrogate mothers, and if so, through
what means?<BR>
<LI>Will the program work with a surrogate mother recruited by the couple?<BR>
<LI>Are surrogate mothers provided with established, experienced psychological
counseling, and if so to what extent?<BR>
<LI>Is medical screening required of the surrogates, and if so to what extent?
Does the program require testing beyond that recommended by the American
Fertility Society?<BR>
<LI>Does the program offer gestational surrogacy (surrogate IVF, ZIFT, host
uterus) as well as traditional surrogacy?<BR>
<LI>How does the program assist with the medical procedures and treatments
required in AI, IVF, and ZIFT? Are they able to coordinate the logistics
between physicians, surrogate mothers, clinics and hospitals?<BR>
<LI>What type of emotional support does the program offer the couple and
surrogate mother - counseling, group support, both?<BR>
<LI>To what extent is contact between the couple and surrogate encouraged
prior to birth?<BR>
<LI>What type of legal counsel is provided to the couple and the surrogate
mother and does it include the preparation of contracts and legal representation
to finalize the parent/child relationship?<BR>
<LI>What are the financial obligations incurred by the couple? What is the
payment schedule?<BR>
<LI>At what point is the couple responsible for the surrogate mother's medical
expenses? Must the couple pay for a surrogate's medical care prior to her
completing the full screening process?<BR>
<LI>Does the program have a medical registry for updating the medical history
of the surrogates or the children?<BR>
<LI>Does the program have a referral list of previous client couples?<BR>
<LI>Does the program have access to the latest legislative policies and laws
regarding surrogacy and are they able to respond in a timely manner to any
changes affecting surrogacy?<BR>
<LI>Do they have back-up personnel to immediately cover in the event of illness,
vacations, other contingencies, etc.?

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=pregnant>"We're Pregnant!"</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>Just as the ways to conceive a child now takes many forms, so do
the methods of telling couples that a baby may be on the way. The Center
plans ahead with couples, physicians and surrogates on how to deliver the
pregnancy results.
<P>Most often, the physician's office will call the Center and the couple
directly if the results are negative. They then agree on who will tell the
surrogate. When the results are positive, they calls goes out to the surrogate
and Center. The surrogate then helps to inform the couple of their success.
<P>Some women want to personally tell their husband of a positive result
in order to replicate the birth process more closely. Others are happy to
have the surrogate give the news. The way surrogates do this are as varied
as they are.
<P>Teddy bears, positive pregnancy tests, and streamers and balloons have
all been used to inform waiting couples. One surrogate learned of her pregnancy
right before Mother's Day and sent a Mother's Day card to announce their
success to the intended parents.
<P>Whatever method of communication the message is the same: a baby is on
the way and with it the fulfillment of a couple's dreams and hopes.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=bonds>Special Bonds - Deciding On A Second Child
Together</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>For infertile couples the path to parenthood is one that requires new
decisions with nearly every step. Once they have decided to create a family
through surrogacy, they must select the surrogate. And, once they have one
child, they must decide if, and how, they will have another. Those who want
more than one child may again look to their surrogate for help.
<P>Surrogate mothers are not asked to commit to carrying more than one pregnancy
but about 20% of surrogates choose to do so. Some become pregnant for the
same couple, others bring a first child to another family.
<P>Typically, the decision to repeat a surrogacy experience for a family
is made when the first child is 6 to 12 months old. By this time, the couple
and surrogate have an established relationship and have decided on the boundaries
of their extended family.
<P>Most gestational surrogates want to provide a couple with a second child
for the same reasons the couple want another child - reasons that are no
different than those given by any family, including those with no fertility
problems. Genetic surrogates agree to more than one pregnancy so the children
will have similar genetic ties and have a shared history of their birth.
<P>All surrogates who go on to a second pregnancy, do so because they found
the first experience positive and safe and believe that what they have done
is special enough to warrant repeating.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=screening>Genetic Screening Will Help Assure a Healthy
Pregnancy</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>by Ann Garber, M.S. Dr.P.H.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Genetic screening for certain inherited disorders provides important
information for couples who are planning a pregnancy. It is estimated that
all individuals are "carriers" of between 5 to 10 recessive genes.
<P>A carrier has one normal gene and one abnormal gene for a specific disorder
in each of his or her cells. Generally, the carrier of a recessive gene does
not have the symptoms of that inherited disease because the normal gene disguises
the abnormal gene.
<P>However, when both the mother and father carry the same defective recessive
gene, there is a one-in-four chance that any child they have will inherit
the recessive gene from both parents and be born with a severe form of the
disease.
<P>Screening for carriers of genetic traits is important when matching couples
with a surrogate using artificial insemination (AI), as well as in vitro
fertilization, (IVF).
<H4>Certain groups are at risk
</H4><P>Genetic screening is particularly important for certain ethnic groups
that have a higher incidence of a genetic disease than found in the general
population.
<P>Those groups include African Americans, who have a higher risk of carrying
the sickle cell trait; Ashkenazi Jews who have an increased risk of carrying
the Tay Sachs gene; and individuals of Mediterranean or Southeast Asian descent
who can carry Thalassemia.
<H4>Disease Often Hidden
</H4><P>A common misconception is that genetic screening is not necessary
unless there is a family history of a genetic disease. In fact, in the majority
of cases where an individual is recognized as being a carrier of a recessive
disease, there is no relative with that disorder.
<P>That is because the disease only shows itself when two carriers contribute
an abnormal gene in the egg and the sperm, and an affected offspring is born.
Usually there is no known prior history of the disease in either side of
the family. Genetic screening for all individuals in high risk populations
is the only way to identify carriers.

<P>Many couples will be able to benefit from the latest advance in assisted
reproduction technology - egg donation - because of the Center's new egg
donor registry program. Egg donation enables women who cannot produce eggs
but can otherwise carry a pregnancy to conceive through IVF.
<P>The Center offers the first organized, comprehensive egg donor registry
to match donors with recipients. A complete guide to egg donation detailing
its history, the process for both donor and recipient, the legal coordination
and psychological counseling services provided and a list of costs is available
from the Center.

<H4>International Surrogacy
</H4><P>The Center has gained international expertise and now provides surrogacy
services and counseling for clients worldwide. Recent advances in embryo
freezing have reduced the cost of procedures for those living in countries
with socialized medicine, shortened travel time and alleviated some of the
emotional turmoil of long distance, third-party cycle synchronization. Successful
surrogacy partnerships have occurred for couples living in Italy, England,
France, Denmark, Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, New Guinea, Hong Kong,
Argentina, Venezuela, Singapore, Guatemala, Nigeria, Taiwan, Egypt, Germany,
Mexico and Sweden.
<P>
<H4>CSP Invited to Address RESOLVE Conferences
</H4><P>The Center has recently presented lectures on the protocols, safeguards
and practical considerations for third-party assisted reproduction at the
Chicago, Salt Lake City and San Diego chapters of RESOLVE.
<P>RESOLVE is a national non-profit organization offering counseling, referral
and support groups to people with infertility problems as well as providing
education and assistance to associated professionals.

<H4>Center Featured in Movie
</H4><P>Deidre Hall, star of daytime television's "Days Of Our Lives" portrays
herself in a made-for-TV movie on surrogacy. Slated to air this year, the
TV special will dramatize Ms. Hall's experience highlighting her 20-year
battle with infertility the turning point of which, with the help of a surrogate
mother, was the triumphant 1992 birth of her son, David. Ms. Hall's story
was featured in a "People" Magazine cover just after the birth of her
long-awaited son.

<H4>New Method of Preparation has 56% Pregnancy Rate
</H4><P>Dr. Michael Feinman and his colleagues at Pacific Fertility Medical
Centers of California have reported a 56% pregnancy rate for egg donation
and gestational surrogacy. This unusually high level of success is achieved
by preparing the recipient with injectable estradiol valerate instead of
giving her oral estrogen or using an estrogen patch. The chances for pregnancy
also increased when the egg provider was under 35 and the recipient had a
healthy uterus.
<H4>PZD, SUZI Methods Show Successful Results
</H4><P>The Huntington Reproductive Center (HRC) in Pasadena reports 30 live
births and approximately 10 ongoing pregnancies utilizing the PZD and SUZI
microfertilization procedures. HRC also is among a handful of clinics in
the U.S. to offer the new ICSI technique, where a single sperm is injected
directly into the cytoplasm of an egg. Using this method egg fertilization
was achieved where only a few immobile sperm were present in the entire
ejaculation.
