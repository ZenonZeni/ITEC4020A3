Diamond Swings
into Sensors

The Fall Meeting of the Materials Research Society (MRS) included
several highlights on diamond technology.  Of particular interest
is research being done in diamond sensing applications at
Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN 37235) by J.L. Davidson (Tel:
615/322-3479, Fax: 615/322-7996) and W.P. Kang.

Sensors used to be simple mechanical springs or thermometers, but
electronic control and processing demand more sensitive and
interfaceable devices.  The area of optic sensors has become
sophisticated, led by demands for missile guidance and clearer TV
images.  The area of mechanical and chemical sensors has lagged
behind because of the lack of an appropriate semiconductor material
to meet the requirements.

The entrance of diamond as a deposited layered film is changing the
picture.  Diamond's attractive properties such as very fast charge
carriers, high electric breakdown, and heat conductivity result in
the best estimated performance for speed and power of any material.


Recently the discovery and development of what might be called
sophisticated secondary effects in diamond are opening interesting
sensor applications.  For example, diamond containing boron becomes
a semiconductor like silicon and will change electrical resistance
with strain, called piezoresistance.

This means it can be used as a strain gauge on rugged electronic
microsensors for pressure and acceleration sensing.  CVD
polycrystalline diamond films have been applied in radiation
detectors, photodetectors and thermistors.  They have the
properties of wide bandgap, low thermal coefficient of expansion,
and high thermal conductivity.

The paper presented at the MRS Meeting by the Vanderbilt
researchers discusses some critical issues about diamond for
microelectromechanical sensing applications such as the stress
limits and high temperature responses of a diamond pressure sensor.
The authors describe an all diamond pressure microsensor that
measures pressures when the temperature exceeds 600(F.  This means
that miniature electronic sensors can be used in critical places
not previously possible, such as the end of oil well drill bits and
in power plants and engines near the combustion zones.

The researchers have also observed that layered diamond films can
behave as chemical sensors measuring oxygen, hydrogen, and many
other chemicals.  For example, a diamond-based chemical gas sensor
using layers of metal and diamond which acts directly as an
electronic device has been made and its behavior as a gas sensor
has been studied.  The adsorption of gases such as those found in
automobile exhausts by the diamond sensor causes changes in its
electrical current behavior similar to altering the sensitive
properties of a transistor. Thus, an electronic change arises from
the presence of a chemical.

This kind of input, coupled to amplifying and computing
electronics, provides sensitive, fast and accurate chemical
measurements which can be very useful in emission control.  Because
the sensor is diamond, it can perform these functions in
environments and at temperatures that would not support monitoring.
Additional information on this research can be obtained by
contacting the authors at the address and number above.

Diamond for Electron
Field Emitters

Another application for diamond technology highlighted at the MRS
Fall Meeting was presented by Wei Zhu (AT&T Bell Labs, Tel:
908/582-7659, Fax: 908/582-2783) and involved the electron field
emission properties of diamond.  Field emitters may be a potential
replacement for hot cathode tubes, because emitters are smaller and
use less power.  Diamond is a preferred field emission material due
to its durability, long lifetime and the low wattage it needs to
perform electronic tasks.

Field emitters are useful for a number of applications including
microwave power amplifiers, flat panel displays, ion guns and
electron sources for microscopes.  Typical field emitters use
metals or semiconductors like silicon with sharp tip geometries.
But the control voltage required for emission from these materials
is relatively high (about 100 V) because of their work functions.


The high voltage operation increases the probability of damaging
instabilites due to ion bombardment and surface diffusion of the
emitting tips, so high power densities have to be supplied from an
external source to produce the required emission current.  In
addition, the fabrication of uniform sharp tips over a large area
proves to be a difficult and expensive process.

Diamond has recently emerged as a desirable field emission material
because of its negative electron affinity and good mechanical and
chemical properties.  To induce stable electron emission from
diamond, however, either the bulk or the surface of diamond must be
made conductive.  And to take advantage of diamond's negative
electron affinity for low voltage emission, diamond must be doped
as a n-type semiconductor.  Unfortunately, effective and reliable
n-type dopants for diamond are not available at the present time.


The AT&T researchers have investigated the emission properties of
a variety of undoped and p-type doped diamond samples, including
CVD deposited diamond and commercial diamond produced by the
traditional high pressure, high temperature method.  They found a
strong correlation between the electrical field required for
emission and the density of defects introduced in diamond.

Low emission fields have been consistently demonstrated for
appropriately processed diamond emitters.  The present status and
future prospects of field emitters for various potential
applications with respect to the availability of suitable materials
was also discussed in the presentation.

Diamond Like Materials
in Flat Panel Displays

A specific presentation on diamond and diamond-like materials for
flat panel displays was presented at the MRS meeting by Keith
Jamison and others  of SI Diamond Technology (Houston, TX; Tel:
713/529-9040, Fax: 713/529-1147).  The next generation of flat
panel displays for computers, personal digital assistants, and
other portable displays may rely on field emitted electrons
striking phosphor as the light source.

This design is essentially a flat CRT where each pixel has its own
electron gun.  Recent experiments have shown that diamond and
diamond-like materials may make robust field emission electron
sources for this application.  Diamond has a high thermal
conductivity, relative insensitivity to contamination and, when
grown under certain conditions, can emit electrons at relatively
low electric fields.

SI Diamond Technology has constructed a prototype 50 x 50 pixel
display using diamond like carbon as the electron source as a proof
of concept for diamond field emission displays.  The company is
currently building a 1/4 VGA display that can be used in commercial
applications.

The electron emission properties of SIDT's diamond like carbon
cathode was presented and compared to other diamond and diamond-
like carbon emitters.  The emission properties were determined
using a number of novel analytical techniques that simulate a field
emission flat panel display and measure the emission uniformity of
the material and emission site density over a given area.  The
cathode requirements for SIDT's flat panel display was also
presented along with current performance of the diamond like carbon
cathode presently used by the company.  For more information,
contact SIDT.

New CVD Dielectrics
Series from Lam

Lam Research Corp. (Fremont, CA; Tel: 510/572-6692, Fax: 510/572-
2935) announced two next generation CVD systems that answer
production level dielectric film requirements on leading edge
devices with 0.35-micron and below design rules.

The Deep SubMicron (DSM) 9900 deposits superior quality insulating
films between metal layers for intermetal dielectric (IMD)
applications, while the DSM 9800 performs premetal dielectric (PMD)
applications by depositing dielectric films prior to first
metallization.  In addition, the 9800 does a number of other
applications including Si02 spacers and Ta205 storage capacitors
for 256 megabit dynamic random access memories (DRAMs).

Together, these systems provide comprehensive dielectric film
solution for chipmakers adopting 0.35-micron and below technology.
Both systems are enhancements to Lam's prior generation systems
tradenamed Integrity PMD and Epic CVD tools introduced for advanced
development efforts in 1990 and 1993.

Lam's chairman and CEO Roger D. Emerick noted that the 9000 series
reflects Lam's intensified focus on the CVD market.  "We first
entered the market in the early 1990s with leapfrog technology.
Once the market demand caught up with our technical innovations, we
needed to prepare these tools for production proliferation," stated
Emerick.

He added that the systems were designed with technology
extendability in mind--both the DSM 9900 and the DSM 9800 have
deposited films on devices with 0.18-micron feature sizes, and the
DSM 9800 has successfully deposited high quality films on 300 mm
wafers.

To meet production requirements, the new 9000 series CVD tools
incorporate features and benefits developed over the last year in
cooperation with several leading chipmakers and SEMATECH.  Specific
changes include reduced footprint, increased throughput, lower cost
of ownership, and the development of process solutions for specific
film types.

Smoother Films for
Machine Tool Coatings

Researchers at Argonne National Lab (Argonne, IL 60439; Tel:
800/627-2596) have developed a new process for growing thin diamond
films from C60 molecules, known as buckyballs or fullerenes.  The
process, which uses fullerenes as precursors for diamond film
growth, produces nanocrystalline films with unique properties.

Very rough films are produced by conventional methods and to make
them smoother would slow the growth rate and interject graphitic
phases into the finished product.  The Argonne films can be made as
rapidly as the rough films but they are true diamond with very
small grain size and are exceptionally smooth (as much as 17
nanometers rms) even at film thicknesses greater than 10
micrometers.  They do not need the expensive post-deposition
polishing required for conventionally grown diamond films.

In this new process, diamond film is grown from fullerene molecules
instead of from hydrocarbons such as methane.  The buckyballs
collide and fragment into highly energetic carbon dimers (C2).  The
dimers then insert into the diamond lattice to form a new diamond
layer.  Since little hydrogen is added in the process compared with
conventional methods, the resulting films have very low hydrogen
content and are high quality.

Because of their smoothness, these films could be used as coatings
for machine tools and bearings.  The films have been deposited on
substrates such as silicon, silicon carbide, silicon nitride,
tungsten and tungsten carbide.  Friction coefficients are as low as
0.05 and, because of their smoothness, the wear rates of the
counterface material have been found to be as much as 100 times
lower than for conventional diamond thin films.  In addition, under
a cooperative R&D agreement funded by the Dept. of Energy's (DOE)
Office of Energy Research, Laboratory and Technology Transfer
Program, Argonne and SI Diamond Technologies (Houston, TX) are
evaluating the films as candidates for filed emission displays.

Another Diamond
Patent for GE

A microwave or flame-assisted method of depositing CVD diamond was
revealed in U.S. Patent 5,464,665, issued November 11, 1995.  The
inventors are Thomas R. Anthony and James F. Fletcher and the
assignee is General Electric in New York.

Broadly, the present invention is directed to improving a chemical
vapor phase deposition (CVD) method for synthesis of diamond
wherein a hydrocarbon/hydrogen gaseous mixture is subjected to a
combustion flame in the presence of oxygen to at least partially
decompose the gaseous mixture to form CVD diamond. The improvement
in process comprises subjecting said combustion flame to one or
more of dielectric heating, d.c. discharge, or a.c. discharge.

Dielectric heating can be accomplished by subjecting the combustion
flame to microwave (MW) frequency discharge or radiofrequency (RF)
discharge. By superimposing dielectric heating or d.c./a.c.
discharge plasma generation on combustion flame process, the carbon
utilization rate of the combustion flame process should improve
substantially. As noted above, given the low carbon utilization
rate for combustion flame techniques already, small percentage
improvements in the carbon utilization rates translate into
substantial cost savings in generation of CVD diamond by such
combustion flame technique.

Diamond Nucleation by
Gas Phase Seeding

Diamond films have been deposited on substrates without
pretreatment by placement of a nickel wire above the substrate by
a group in Germany, led by Ch. Woll (Institut fur Angewandte
Physikalische Chemie, Universitat Heidelberg, INF 253, 69120
Heidelberg, Germany; email: cc1@ix.urz.uni-heidelberg.de), reported
in Applied Physics Letters.  The nickel wire was seen to increase
the nucleation density by five orders of magnitude.  Electron
microscopy showed continuous diamond films to be produced with
Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showing the
presence of Ni in the diamond phase.

The diamond was grown in a standard hot filament CVD chamber with
a tungsten hot coil and a resistively heated substrate holder.  The
substrate (100 or 111 silicon or Cu) was heated to 800-850oC, 5 mm
from the filament.  Growth rates of 0.5-1 micron/hour were attained
in a 0.5% methane, 95.5% hydrogen at a 100 sccm flow rate.  When
the Ni wires were placed 0.5-1 mm from the substrate diamond was
seen to grow preferentially in the area in line with the Ni wire
and the coil.

Carbon-Coated
Metal Particles

Researchers at Northwestern University (Evanston, IL, Tel: 708/491-
3115) have discovered a way to cover tiny pellets of metal with
graphite in an airtight fashion.  Electron microscope pictures of
the pellets, which measure less than a millionth of an inch across,
show layers of single atoms of graphite running around them.  The
pictures resemble bucky tubes, a relative of buckyballs.  Instead
of being hollow tubes, however, the spherical layers totally
encapsulate the round metal pellets.

The pellets, called encapsulated nanoparticles, form spontaneously
when graphite is present during the process of vaporizing the metal
particles using a tungsten-based electric arc, according to the
researchers.  They believe the pellets could be used in a wide
range of applications such as medicine, since they could travel
through the human bloodstream without exposing the body to the
metal contained inside.  They would be useful in MRI giving greater
clarity to images inside the body, and in anti-cancer therapy and
cell separations which currently use larger magnetic particles.

The discovery was described at the Fall Meeting of the MRS in
Boston by graduate student Jon Host.  The research team was headed
by D. Lynn Johnson and Julia Weertman, Walter P. Murphy professors
of materials science and engineering; Vinayak P. Dravid, associate
professor; and Thomas O. Mason, professor of materials science and
engineering at Northwestern's Robert R. McCormick School of
Engineering and Applied Science.

The pellets have other possible uses such as magnetic strips on
credit cards, magnetic ink on checks, and in cassette tapes.  The
finding was unexpected.  The original goal of the research was to
manufacture, analyze and utilize the tiny metal particles, which
measure 10 nanometers in diameter.  When a batch of nickel
particles was soaked in acid so it could be analyzed for any
possible contamination from the tungsten, it was discovered that a
black residue remained at the bottom of the container which
continued to be magnetic.

When analyzed with the transmission electron microscope, the
researchers realized that the nickel particles had been insulated
from the surrounding acid by the layers of carbon atoms surrounding
it.  The original findings were reported in the journal Nature.

Photoluminescence
in Thin Films

Photoluminescence has been detected in thin films of partially
oxidized silicon (Si) nanoclusters by scientists at the Lawrence
Livermore National Lab (Livermore, CA 94550; Tel: 510/422-1100).
The scientists, reports Lloyd L. Chase, synthesized Si nanoclusters
with average diameters of only a few nanometers (nm) using thermal
vaporization of Si in an argon (Ar) gas background.  The first
monolayer of Si nanoclusters was deposited directly onto the basal
plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, and the layer was
exposed to oxygen (O2) for five minutes.  Although, additional
monolayers were added until the film thickness reached about 250
nm, no photoluminescence was observed.

Post annealing the film in O2 produced a white photoluminescence,
which peaked at about 600 nm.  The photoluminescence increased in
intensity as a function of annealing time and temperature up to
850(C without any accompanying shift in wavelength.  The decay time
was less than five nanoseconds.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed extensive oxidation of
the film, and the photoluminescence excitation spectrum of the film
showed a strong resemblance to the optical absorption curve of bulk
Si, except for an increase in absorption at wavelengths longer than
375 nm.  The scientists attribute the photoluminescence to the
recombination of carriers in localized defect centers in the
silicon oxide layer.

MRC Targets
Win Certification

Materials Research Corp. (Orangeburg, NY), a leading supplier of
thin film manufacturing equipment and materials for the worldwide
semiconductor and magnetics industries announced that it has
received certification from Applied Materials, Inc. as an approved
supplier of aluminum alloy targets tradenamed Monobloc for the
Applied Materials Endura PVD system.  To support chipmakers, MRC
has also acquired an Endura 5500 physical vapor deposition system
for its Advanced Materials Division's (AMD) Thin Film Lab--making
it the first target supplier to make this equipment investment.

The certification from Applied means that MRC's Monobloc targets
meet Applied's stringent standards for reproducibility, thus
offering consistent performance over the life of the target.
According to Ken Barry, VP and general manager of MRC's Advanced
Materials Div., MRC worked with a major U.S. captive chipmaker to
obtain the certification.  "The certification is particularly
significant because it demonstrates the consistent performance of
MRC's Monobloc targets in a 200 mm production environment--between
wafer runs and across manufacturing sites.  Targets from three
different MRC facilities were tested, and all met certification
criteria," stated Barry.

When tested, the Monobloc targets achieved Rs uniformity of <5% 3
sigma over the life of the target.  In addition to Monobloc
targets, MRC manufactures targets for its own sputtering systems
tradenamed Eclipse, Primus, and Solarus.  MRC is also an
established supplier of refractory and precious metal targets for
the Endura system.

World's Largest
System Underway

Implant Sciences Corp. (107 Audubon Rd., Wakefield, MA 01880, Tel:
617/246-0700, Fax: 617/246-1167) introduced the world's largest
system for ion implantation and ion beam-assisted deposition.  The
ISC ion beam processing system will be installed in Spring, 1996,
at the Environmental Technology Facility of the National Defense
Center for Environmental Excellence, operated by Concurrent
Technologies Corp. in Johnstown, PA.

NDCEE is a national demonstration facility dedicated to the
development of clean manufacturing techniques for the Dept. of
Defense (DOD), and transfer of environmentally sound process
technology to DOD contractors and American industry.

The system will be used, among other applications, to develop ion
beam-assisted evaporation of chromium and nitrogen ion implantation
as clean replacement processes for toxic hexavalent chrome
electroplating.

The stainless steel vacuum chamber is 6 ft. in diameter and 12 ft.
long, including extensions and a gantry/trolley system for
accepting large cylindrical parts up to 6 ft. long and one ton in
weight.  A 24 in. diameter rotary substrate table holds smaller
parts for ion beam processing, and may be tilted, heated or
electrically biased.  A planetary rotation fixture is also
included.

Multiple sensors measure substrate temperature, deposition rate,
beam current density, and analyze residual gas.  Two 20 in.
cryopumps, an 8 in. cryopump, a 245 CFM roughing pump, and a 30,000
liter/sec cryopanel comprise the pumping system, which is
supplemented by a UV lamp array to expedite outgassing of water and
organics.  An optional load lock for continuous processing is
available.

Three gas ion sources ranging from 30 eV to 100 keV are included in
the basic system, which has provisions for adding another ion or
deposition source.  Called the ISC-5000, the system has a high
current 100 kV bucket type ion source which provides a very high
nitrogen ion current of over 50 mA.  The system also features a
large low energy ion source and a medium energy ion source with
beam currents of 2.5 A and 1 A respectively.

Two electron beam evaporators allow the deposition of up to five
materials.  PVD evaporation combined with ion bombardment can
improve important coating properties such as adherence, hardness,

Applied Materials
Offers New Implanter

Applied Materials (Santa Clara, CA, Tel: 408/727-5555) introduced
its Precision Implant xR80 ion implanter which is targeted to the
low-energy implant market.  The energy range is capped at 80 KeV
but the system performs the delicate task of forming the
transistors on chips with deep submicron design rules.

The new implanter is capable of generating a beam at relatively
high current levels (5 milliamps at 5 KeV).  This boosts throughput
when forming the shallow junctions, as opposed to deep wells, of
DRAM and logic devices built with 0.25- and 0.18-micron line
widths.  The xR80 is tailored to the formation of transistors and
differs from the recently announced Genus implanter which is more
of a general purpose system.

Focused Ion Beams
Make Smaller Chips

Los Alamos National Lab (New Mexico) researchers are trying to make
smaller computer chips using technology first developed for the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's now defunct Neutral
Particle program.  Ion beams used in microlithography are focused
by magnetic optics.  This technology offers narrower linewidths
than now possible which makes more compact and powerful circuits.

According to Dr. Tom Mottershead (Tel: 505/667-9730.) of Los
Alamos, this technology can achieve a 25-to-1 reduction in beam
diameter.  A sharp focus such as this allows the beam to deliver
high current densities for etching the fine lines of microchip
circuitry.  The technology is also useful in probing the surfaces
of high density microcircuits, inspecting the patterns of
photomasks, and checking for defects.  Data storage is another
possible application as focused beams of gallium ions could read
and write data in media more durable than today's CD-ROM.

Dr. Mottershead has proposed experimentation on an in-house basis
at the Lab's Accelerator Operations and Technology Div. using an
existing tandem electrostatic accelerator, and is interested in
possible collaborations with industry.

Advances in
Quantum Wire

Advances in the production of quantum wires is reported by a
research group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
(Urbana, IL 61081).  The team, headed by Keh-Yung Cheng (Tel:
217/333-6642, Fax: 217/244-6375, email: kcheng@uxl.cso.uiuc.edu),
have used molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and strain induced lateral
layering ordering (SILO) techniques to build quantum wires,
nanoscale atomic structures believed to dramatically increase the
efficiency and reliability of light emitting devices such as laser
diodes.

Many of the advances in computing, data storage and
telecommunications have come as a result of the evolution of
semiconductor materials.  While silicon has been utilized to
stretch the bounds of computer processing power and speed, other
semiconductors have been applied to create photonic devices.  Such
devices can emit or detect light; for example, semiconductor laser
diodes can be used to read data from compact disks.

Over the past 30 years, the techniques for creating these
semiconductors have been refined.  Using an MBE method, scientists
can grow semiconductors in layers as thin as one atom.  By
selecting the types of semiconductor material, properties such as
the color of its light emissions can be engineered.

An ultrathin layer, or quantum well, has done much to improve the
reliability and efficiency of light emitting devices.  This quantum
well is the center of a semiconductor sandwich that is only a few
dozen atoms thick.  When structures approach this nanoscale,
electrons begin to change their characteristics and exhibit quantum
size effects.  Such changes can affect and improve the overall
performance of optical devices, such as achieving more light
generation for a laser diode.

The next step in quantum devices are structures that utilize
quantum wires.  Similar to quantum wells, quantum wires have atomic
scale thickness in two dimensions instead of one.  With this
additional degree of quantum confinement, it is theorized that even
higher levels of efficiency and reliability can be observed in
practical optical devices.

The color of a standard laser diode's output light can vary with
time and temperature.  Quantum wire lasers, though, are thought to
maintain uniform characteristics over a broader range of
environmental variables.  Until now, very little success has been
achieved in preparing such quantum wire structures.

In the Illinois work, the SILO process used MBE to grow
alternating, ultrathin layers, less than two atoms thick, inside
semiconductor structures.  The number of atoms in each layer is
slightly different, either lesser or greater, than would normally
be required.  The resulting atomic imbalance creates a strain force
inside the growing crystal.  The strain force, in turn, causes
certain atoms to group together along lines on the growing surface.
When the SILO process is combined with quantum well fabrication
techniques in MBE quantum wire regions are formed almost
automatically.

Cheng's group has demonstrated laser devices emitting in the
visible and infrared (IR) spectra range using quantum wires.  The
devices, showed various new and unexpected optical characteristics,
are the subject of further research at the university.  Eventual
end uses may include improved supermarket checkout scanners and
home fiber optic communications.

AT&T Develops
Stable Facet Films

Silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for use as nonhermetic laser
facet coatings have been produced by researchers at AT&T Corp. (600
Mountain Ave., Murray Hill, NJ 07974; Tel: 201/582-3000).  Naresh
Chand relates, in U.S. Patent 5,440,575, that the new films have
low levels of cracks, voids and particulate contamination and that
they are stable in ambient atmospheres.

The surfaces of nearly all semiconductor lasers must be protected
and/or modified.  Although dielectric films suitable for some
devices are widely used, e.g., silicon dioxide (SiO2) on silicon
(Si), there is a need for a dielectric that is mechanically and
chemically stable and free of pinholes, cracks, particulates and
voids.  It should also have good adhesion, be highly resistant to
moisture penetration and be adaptable for use as a semiconductor
laser facet coating regardless of emission wavelength.

A number of materials, including yttrium stabilized zirconia (YSZ),
have been proposed, but end up with shortcomings, including poor
reproducibility with respect to refractive index and/or mechanical
stress and contamination with particulates.  In addition,
conventional facet coatings are not normally stable in the ambient
atmosphere, causing changes in laser properties and premature laser
failure.

Because of the problems associated with conventional facet
coatings, nearly all such devices are packaged in hermetic, gas-
filled enclosures.  These hermetic lasers are widely used in
optical fiber communications, optical interconnects, sensors, and
printing.  Hermetic enclosures add to the complexity of
manufacturing processes, reduces yield, and increases the cost of
the devices.  The AT&T researchers sought a highly reliable laser
facet coating stable in the ambient atmosphere.

The AT&T scientists discovered that under the right processing
conditions, high quality silicon oxide (SiOx) films suitable for
use as laser facet coatings could be produced.  The key to their
work was the use of a deposition by molecular beam technique
instead of conventional thermal evaporation processes.  The surface
layer of the film is nearly always SiO2, but this layer normally
represents only about 10% of the entire film in most cases.  If
particular reflectivities are needed, the SiOx film can be combined
with layers of other dielectric or semiconductor materials
deposited using the same technique.

Single Crystal Films for
High Frequency Uses

Another paper of interest to the thin film business was presented
at the Fall Materials Research Society Meeting.  It was part of the
epitaxial oxide thin films symposium and was given by Y. Suzuki and
colleagues from AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey (Tel: 908/582-4633).
Others involved in this research include R.B. van Dover, E.M.
Gyorgy, V. Korenivski, Julia M. Phillips, D. Werder, C.H. Chen, and
R.J. Felder.  The basic thrust of this work follows.

High frequency filters that can be incorporated into integrated
circuits would ease design problems where power dissipation is
tightly budgeted.  In mobile communications, integrated filters
could have an impact on increasing performance while reducing size
and cost.  These filters are composed of capacitors and inductors.
While capacitors have been easily incorporated into integrated
circuit technology due to their planar geometry, inductor
components have not.

The solutions have been either to use discrete inductor components
or to simulate an inductor with a capacitor in an active circuit.
The former solution raises size and cost, while the latter possibly
reduces performance and reliability.  Therefore, a high performance
integrated inductor would be an excellent solution.

To fabricate an inductor with a large inductance, a significant
field has to be generated over a large volume.  The researchers can
increase the inductance of a thin film device material by using
high permeability material.  There are other requirements for the
materials to be used in these thin film inductors.  To reduce
dissipative losses due to eddy currents, a magnetic material with
low conductivity has to be used.

Other requirements include high saturation magnetization values at
room temperature and low magnetic losses.  Sinel structure ferrites
are good candidates.  The successful growth of single crystal
ferrites in thin film form is an important step towards their
future incorporation into integrated circuits operating at
microwave frequencies.

The AT&T researchers have successfully grown high quality single
crystalline spinel ferrite thin films of (Mn,Zn)Fe204 and CoFe204
on SrTi03 and MgAl204 substrates at low temperature.  These ferrite
films are buffered with spinel structure layers that are
nonmagnetic at room temperature.  Ferrite films grown on SrTi03 and
MgAl204 buffered with CoCr204 and NiMn204 exhibit excellent
crystallinity and bulk saturation values, thus indicating the
importance of lattice match and structural similarity between the
film and the immediately underlying layer.

X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, atomic
force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy analysis
provide a consistent picture of the structural properties of these
ferrite films.  The researchers have also incorporated these single
crystalline ferrite thin films into device structures to take
advantage of their high permeability.

Diffusion Barrier
Method Patented

AT&T, NJ, was issued U.S. Patent 5,468,689 on November 21, 1995,
for a method for preparing a silicon nitride gallium diffusion
barrier for use in molecular beam epitaxial growth of gallium
arsenide (GaAs).  The inventors are John E. Cunningham, Keith W.
Goossen, William Y. Jan, and James A. Walker.

The technique involves reacting nitrogen and silane in a ratio of
less than 300:1 in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
apparatus to form a silicon nitride layer.  This layer is deposited
on a reflowable glass layer previously deposited on a (100) silicon
substrate oriented 3 degrees off axis and bearing a thin film of
silicon dioxide.  Finally, GaAs is deposited by molecular beam
epitaxial growth on the silicon nitride layer.  The technique is
said to be of interest for use in the monolithic integration of
interconnected GaAs/AlGaAs double heterostructures, modulators and
silicon MOSFET structures.

Mid-IR Laser
Likes It Warm

A team of scientists from the Naval Research Lab (NRL) and the
University of Houston Space Vacuum Epitaxy Center (SVEC) has
developed a mid-infrared (IR) solid state laser which operates near
room temperature.

According to Shin-Shem Steven Pei, SVEC's associate director for
research (Tel: 713/743-3621; email: spei@uh.edu), lasing was
observed at temperatures up to 285 K (54(F). "This is by far the
highest operating temperature for an interband transition laser at
this wavelength," he explained. "We now have a device which works
with a compact thermoelectric cooler instead of a unwieldy
cryogenic system, and room temperature operation is just around the
corner."

The new laser is an optically-pumped InAs/GaInSb/AlInSb type-II
quantum well structure producing light at a wavelength of 4
microns. The device was fabricated from materials produced by SVEC
and then tested at the NRL. The NRL/SVEC team is now optimizing the
material growth and device design for diode lasers that can produce
sufficient power at 3-5 microns without cooling. Currently, SVEC
scientists are also testing a more advanced quantum- cascade laser
design, which should produce higher-intensity light with less
electric current, while emitting within either of two atmospheric
transmission windows at 3-5 microns and 8-12 microns.

Lasers emitting in these windows have many important industrial,
medical, and military applications, such as IR radar for vehicle
and air traffic control, medical diagnosis, eye-safe covert
illumination for night vision, free space communications, and IR
countermeasures.  Further, since many gases absorb strongly in
these windows, these lasers are ideal for remote chemical sensing.
This large class of applications includes pollution and greenhouse
gas monitoring, drug and explosives detection, chemical process
control, and leak detection.  The projected market for these IR
systems will approach $1.5 billion by 2001 if efficient and compact
IR sources are available.

The semiconductor lasers used in most consumer devices emit at much
shorter wavelengths. Long distance telephone networks use 1.3 and
1.5 micron lasers in their optical-fiber systems, and a 0.8 micron
beam reads music and data from CDs.  (By comparison, visible light
ranges from about 0.4 to 0.7 microns.) However, water vapor readily
absorbs light with wavelengths outside the atmospheric transmission
windows, restricting its range.  Gas lasers operating within the
windows are too bulky and expensive for most commercial
applications.

Photodetectors
Set a Record

A record low dark current operation of InGaAs (1.55 micron) p-I-n
Photodetectors on silicon and GaAs has been reported in Applied
Physics Letters.  The authors, led by  F. E. Ejeckan (School of
Electrical Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853;
email: felix@ee.cornell.edu), fabricated the photo conductors by
first bonding the p-I-n epitaxial layers, followed by chemical
removal of the host InP substrate from the p-I-n structure, after
which the photodetector was fabricated on top of the exposed p-I-n
layers.

Bonding of the photodetector to the substrate is done as efforts at
heteroepitaxial growth have not met with success due to the
inherent material defects present in devices grown by this method.
Bonding eliminates these material defects but the films often are
mechanically weak and thermally unstable.  The technique employed
by the authors of bonding by atomic rearrangement (BAR) avoids this
weakness and obtains a covalently bonded interface free of defects
other than crystallographic misfit.

Under 5 volt reverse bias, dark currents down to 57 pA on GaAs and
290 nA on Si were measured.  A external quantum efficiency of 80%
was deduced from the responsivity at 1.55 microns of 1 A/W, and the
series resistance across the bonded interface was 17 ohms for GaAs
and 350 ohms for Si.

Laser Ablation
of Diamond

Thin, electron-transparent layers of diamond for examination in the
transmission electron microscope (TEM) can be fabricated from
thicker diamond substrates by using a laser beam to ablate the
surface of the substrate according to work done at Caltech and the
Research Triangle Institute for NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab
(Pasadena, CA, Tel: 818/354-2240).  Those involved include Thomas
George, Marc C. Foote, Richard P. Vasquez, and Edward P. Fortier of
Caltech, and John B. Posthill of RTI.

An older method of laser ablation involved the use of photon energy
above the gap between the valence and conduction electron-energy
bands of the diamond substrate, but this method involves the use of
photon energy below the band gap.  The growing interest in the use
of diamond as a bulk substrate and as a coating material has
increased the need for TEM for characterization of diamond-based
materials.  The below-band-gap laser ablation method may help to
satisfy this need, and it could also be applied in general to
cutting and etching of diamonds.

The basic idea is that below-band-gap radiation should not be
absorbed in the bulk of the substrate.  As a result, damage to the
bulk of the substrate should be minimized and the major part of
absorption of radiant energy should take place on the surface on
which the laser beam impinges.  In experiments to test the
feasibility of the method, a pulsed, focused beam from a KrF
excimer laser was used to thin substrates of a type 1a natural
diamond at normal and glancing (22() incidence.  The laser
wavelength was 248 nm, whereas the band-gap wavelength of pure
natural diamond is about 226 nm.

The surfaces of the laser-thinned substrates were examined by use
of scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The diamond substrates
thinned at glancing incidence could be examined in this way without
further treatment.  However, to render the substrate thinned at
normal incidence transparent to electrons, it was necessary to
perform argon-ion milling to remove a layer of graphitic and
amorphous carbon that had formed on the ablated surface.  (This
layer apparently forms early in the laser ablation process and
enhances the absorption of radiation at the surface).

Ultratech, Photronics
Sign Agreement

Ultratech Stepper (San Jose, CA, Tel: 408/577-3009, Fax: 408/577-
3379) a leading supplier of photolithography systems used to make
semiconductors and thin film heads, and Photronics, Inc. (203/775-
9000) a leading photomask supplier, signed a strategic alliance for
reticle manufacturing.  Under the agreement, the two companies will
investigate technology development opportunities and focus on
customer requirements for increased performance, timeliness and
cost-effectiveness.

Ultratech's president and CEO Arthur Zafiropoulo explained the
reasoning behind the alliance: "As technology becomes more complex
and demanding, it is crucial for companies in our industry to work
closely together to ensure that customers' requirements are met.
Both Ultratech and Photronics are known for forging strong
relationships with their customers.  This formalized agreement will
provide the vision and perspective necessary to pursue a unified
effort to address industry's demands."

Photronic's chairman and CEO Constantine "Deno" Macricostas added,
"Lithography technology has emerged as an important factor in
achieving success at the sub 0.35 micron level.  Now, more than
ever, it is important for equipment and photomask makers to work
together so that we are in a position to support our customers as
they begin to produce products with increasingly tighter design
rules."

In a separate announcement, Ultratech said it has teamed with
government and industry partners to develop a technology that could
produce ultra shallow transistor junctions for use in sub 0.25-
micron technology.  The proposed method is expected to reduce the
number of process steps currently used, potentially providing users
with a lower manufacturing cost.  The new technology is termed P-
GILD, an acronym for Projection-Gas Immersion Layer Doping, and
merges photolithography, doping and annealing technology into a
single tool.

research partnership focusing on Materials and Bulk Processes
Sciences, which deals with front-end manufacturing processes,
starting materials for mainstream integrated circuit fabrication
and thermal processes and deposition of active film above the
interface.  The partnership will also emphasize research in
Environment, Safety and Health Sciences.

    Lam Research (Fremont, CA) announced that Way Tu, 38, has been
appointed president, effective January 1, 1996.  Reporting to Roger
D. Emerick, chairman and CEO, Tu is chartered with overseeing the
daily operations of the company and ensuring that Emerick's vision
for Lam's future business operation is realized.  Most recently VP
of Lam's oxide etch business unit, Tu has been with the company
since 1983.

    3M Co. (Minneapolis, MN) has joined the Austin-based
SEMI/Sematech consortium of majority U.S.-owned and controlled
equipment, materials, software, and service suppliers to the
semiconductor industry.  And the 3M Electronics Div. has opened the
$43 million expansion of its Columbia, MO plant.

    Silicon Valley Group Inc., (San Jose, CA) has completed a
public offering of 3.5 million shares of common stock at
$32.75/share.  According to the company, the proceeds, estimated at
$109.7 million, will be used to buy capital equipment, expand
manufacturing facilities, and finance working capital requirements
and R&D activities.

    SEMATECH may establish a separate entity for the qualification
and characterization of 300-mm process tools.  Although the yet to
be named group will have more freedom to establish international
ties,  the top 10 Japanese semiconductor makers appear to want
membership instead in a new joint venture, tentatively named the
Semiconductor Equipment Evaluation Center.  While there is
excellent U.S.-Japanese cooperation on wafer standards and other
competitive matters, tool qualification is viewed as too sensitive
a topic to be shared between the two countries.

Tencor & Uniphase
Combine Technology

Tencor Instruments (Mountain View, CA) and Uniphase Corp. (San
Jose, CA), completed a three year agreement under which Tencor will
become the exclusive OEM reseller for the laser imaging defect
review station and automatic defect classification (ADC) software
developed and manufactured by the Ultrapointe subsidiary of
Uniphase.

These products are used to analyze defects on wafers during the
semiconductor manufacturing process.  Tencor designs and makes
wafer defect inspection and thin film measurement and metrology
systems used in the semiconductor and related industries.

The ability to review defects using ADC software is becoming
increasingly important to semiconductor manufacturers as it
facilitates defect classification without direct operator
evaluation at each defect site.  This facility improves reliability
and consistency by eliminating operator-induced variations.  This
kind of automation also helps speed analysis of the vast amounts of
defect data and classifications necessary for yield enhancement
programs.

There are several microscope technologies currently in use within
the semiconductor industry including white light, laser confocal
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The Ultrapointe imaging
system uses a laser confocal microscope and Silicon Graphics
workstation to provide integrated 3-D images of defects on
semiconductor wafers.  These 3-D displays are similar to those
produced by an SEM but can be obtained at a considerable lower
cost.

The new agreement will not effect Tencor's ongoing efforts towards
completion of the ADC joint development project with SEMATECH, the
government/industry consortium semiconductor manufacturing
research, announced in early 1995.

New Defect Data
Management System

Tencor Instruments (Mountain View, CA; Tel: 408/654-2926)
introduced a defect data management system tradenamed SwiftAccess
that performs fast, in-line analysis of defect data from a variety
of sources, including the company's new Surfscan inspection system.

Identification of defects and their significance is becoming more
critical to the inspection process.  Although current inspection
systems generate large amounts of defect data, the info is only
valuable if device makers can use it to improve their manufacturing
process.  Therefore, they need a fast, reliable means of viewing,
analyzing and acting on the defect data generated during
inspection.  SwiftAccess is designed to meet this need.

The system collects and analyzes defect data as it is gathered from
inspection systems, scanning electron microscopes (SEMs), review
stations, and probe and test systems, and then uses the information
to monitor the process, identify process excursions and provide
critical process control information.  It can distribute data over
mulitple networked nodes, independent of the hardware platform, and
can collect data from the majority of inspection systems.

Designed for ease of use, SwiftAccess features an X-Windows
architecture and Unix operating system that enable smooth
integration into a fab's existing network.  The system offers high
reliability and robustness, as well as scalability for next
generation applications.

Every Aspect
of VCSELs

Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers, by Terence Edward Sale of
the U.K.-based University of Sheffield, covers the principles,
theory, design and operation of vertical cavity surface emitting
lasers (VCSELs).  Semiconductor lasers have advanced a long way
since their first demonstration in the early 1960s and have a large
impact on many devices today.

They act as sources for optical fiber systems and permit the
reading of data from compact discs and barcode labels.  VCSELs have
many advantages over conventional semiconductor lasers.  The most
obvious is the possibility of very large arrays and a narrow
circular output beam, which can be efficiently coupled into the
core of a fiber.  As a result, the author believes that the time
for a book devoted to VCSELs has come.

The first chapter of the volume describes the history and prospects
of VCSELs and the choice of material systems for emission in
different wavelengths.  The second chapter concerns the optical
properties of short vertical cavities, and the quantum mechanical
processes facilitating optical gain and spontaneous emission
processes are the focus of the third chapter.  Concepts are
developed from basic principles, and the effect of strain on the
optical processes in quantum wells is also covered.  Readers are
introduced to techniques for epitaxial crystal growth and the
fabrication of VCSEL devices in Chapter 4, and Chapter 5 explores
the resistance problems that can arise due to the many
heterojunctions in dielectric reflector stacks.

Chapters 6 and 7 are case studies which describe measurements made
on 2 VCSEL structures, one grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)
and the other by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).
In Chapter 8, experimental data from these case studies are
analyzed using models, and the final chapter describes other
aspects of VCSELs such as modulation response, arrays and noise
performance.

The book does a good job of covering the VCSEL field and should be
of value to those experienced in the optics field, as well as to
novices and students.  Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers is
published by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (605 Third Ave., New York, NY
10158; Tel: 212/850-6336). 1995.  Price: $89.95
