<H1>Insurance against climate change?<BR>
The AOSIS proposal</H1>
<HR>
<B>Climate change poses uncertain risks for many vulnerable countries.</B>  Scientific 
uncertainty makes it impossible to know just how climate change will affect different parts of the 
world over the coming decades and centuries.  Some of the expected consequences, such as <A 
HREF = "fs102.html">sea-level rise</A>, would clearly wreak economic 
havoc in many countries.  Warmer temperatures and changes in storm and precipitation patterns 
would also cause widespread damage.  Although the signatories to the <A HREF = 
"fs250.html">Climate Change Convention</A> have accepted the need for 
providing financial and technical assistance to help developing countries cope with the consequences 
of climate change, the enormous scale of the possible damage could render such assistance 
inadequate.<P>
<B>Insurance schemes could be set up to protect countries from the costs of devastating 
impacts.</B>  Individuals, companies, and governments often use commercial insurance to share risk 
with others and so protect themselves against losses.  If climate change has its expected effects, 
however, the resulting <A HREF = "fs105.html">disasters</A> might be 
too extensive to be commercially insurable. Already, the number of major natural disasters recorded 
in the 1980s was five times higher than in the 1960s.1  Moreover, the damage caused by each disaster 
has risen as population pressure, environmental degradation, and poverty have rendered greater 
numbers of people more vulnerable.  As a result, the total economic cost of natural disasters has 
increased three-fold since the 1960s, while insured losses have risen by a factor of 4.8.  Insurers are 
responding by reducing their risks; some insurers, for example, withdrew completely from Western 
Samoa and American Samoa in 1992 after the devastation of Cyclone Val.  The withdrawal of 
insurance threatens to leave financially strapped states to cover the entire costs of natural disasters as 
well as those related to climate change.<P>
<B>The Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) has proposed that an "International 
Insurance Pool" be established to cover climate change impacts.</B>  The Pool would take the 
financial burden suffered by affected developing countries and distribute it amongst the industrialised 
countries.  The members of the Pool would be divided into two groups.  The first group would 
consist of <A HREF = "fs203.html">low-lying coastal countries and small 
island states</A> that would receive insurance coverage from the fund.  The second group would 
include industrialised countries who would contribute funds.  While the AOSIS proposal addresses 
the concerns of its members about sea-level rise, the same principal could be applied to other groups 
of countries and other possible climate change impacts.<P>
<B>Similar international insurance funds have already been established. </B> The AOSIS 
insurance proposal is similar to mechanisms contained in the OECD Nuclear Damage Convention of  
1963 and in the Oil Pollution Damage Convention of 1971.  It calls for basing 50% of contributions 
on GNP and 50% on national CO2 emissions.  The initial target proposed for the fund is up to 0.1% 
of the OECD's GNP.  An alternative approach would be to calculate contributions according to each 
country's current commercial insurance expenditures.  Annual insurance expenditure world-wide is 
US$858 billion, 72% of which is spent by the US and Europe.  This second method would produce 
similar results to the first.2<P>
<B>The AOSIS proposal calls for Pool contributions to be collected ten years after the Climate 
Change Convention enters into force - provided the rate of global mean sea-level rise has by 
then reached an agreed figure.</B>  This ten-year delay would give the funding countries sufficient 
time to make their initial investments.  If sea-levels have not risen too much by the time the ten-year 
period expires, a review of conditions would be undertaken.  This would give time to improve the 
scientific understanding of climate change and its risks. Meanwhile, the insured countries would be 
required to make an inventory of assets in threatened areas, to register them, and to periodically 
update the registry.  Non-market values such as biodiversity would be included in the valuation. (The 
AOSIS proposal was presented to the negotiators of the Climate Convention but was not included in 
the final treaty.)<P>
<B>AOSIS argues that this approach would be less expensive for the funders than providing 
aid in the event of a major disaster . . .</B>  Moreover, knowing that the damage done by 
sea-level rise is going to involve compensation, the industrialised countries would have an incentive to 
work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Indeed, the fund will never pay out if the 
predicted consequences of climate change do not take place.<P>
<B>and that it would not discourage vulnerable states from taking precautions.  
</B>Commercial insurance sometimes creates the problem of "moral hazard" whereby the insured 
party acts in a riskier fashion than it would otherwise.  The proposed Pool, however, would avoid this 
risk in several ways. The insured countries would have to prove that the cost of preventing the 
damage caused by sea-level rise, even with international funding, would have been greater than the 
damage incurred.  The loss of commercially insured assets could not be claimed from the Insurance 
Pool, and limits to coverage would be imposed to prevent any one country depleting the fund with a 
major claim.  Finally, if total claims in any one period happen to be greater than the size of the Pool, 
compensation payments would be made on a pro rata basis.  <P>
