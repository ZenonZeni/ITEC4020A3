<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h3><em>Muhammed Majeed, Ph.D. </em></h3>
<p>Citrin&#174; is the trade name given to a calcium salt of
(-)-hydroxycitric acid [(-)HCA], a complex of the active
principle derived from Garcinia cambogia and Garcinia indica
which are native to India. This product is standardized herbal
extract derived from the pericarp of the Indian Berry (the rind
of the fruit of Garcinia cambogia and Garcinia Indica). The story
of Citrin&#174; revolves around the interlocking discoveries of
herbalists, botanists, and pharmaceutical scientists working
together to bring forth a revolutionary solution to an age-old
human dilemma -- the problem of how to achieve effective weight
management and reduce excess body fat. Through its novel and safe
mechanisms of action, Citrin&#174; offers consumers and health
care practitioners alike an effective dietary supplement for
accelerating fat-burning, inhibiting the formation of new fat,
and promoting cardiovascular health.</p>

<h2><strong>(-)HCA and Weight Control</strong></h2>
<p>During the 1970s, researchers at Brandeis University and at
Hoffman La Roche Laboratories discovered that fat synthesis could
be blocked if citrate lyase were inhibited. In both test tube
studies and animal experiments, they demonstrated that
(-)-hydroxycitrate impeded the biosynthesis of fats. The
inhibition of fat synthesis by (-)-hydroxycitrate occurred in
liver cell cultures and in the livers of living rats which had
received this compound orally or by injection. Intrigued by these
findings, the researchers speculated that (-)-hydroxycitrate
might be advantageous for weight control.<br>
Further studies conducted by these researchers showed that the
inclusion of (-)-hydroxycitrate into the diet of test animals
markedly suppressed weight gain in young, growing rats. This
suppression of added weight resulted directly from the blockage
of fat accumulation. It had no impact on the build-up of lean
mass. Also, the effect was dose-dependent. The most impressive
findings were observed when (-)-hydroxycitrate accounted for one
percent or more of the diet. The (-)-hydroxycitrate used in these
experiments was synthesized as a trisodium salt and administered
to the experimental animals in this form.<br>
When given an optimal intake of (-)-hydroxycitrate, the test rats
tended to eat less, and their food consumption was suppressed by
10 percent or more. This pattern of appetite suppression also was
seen in rats whose appetite-regulating centers in the brain had
been surgically destroyed. Furthermore, very little
(-)-hydroxycitrate reached the brain. These findings strongly
suggest that the appetite-suppressive effect of this substance is
not centered in the brain (as is the case for many
appetite-curbing drugs). Rather, it is located in the liver.<br>
One of the chief functions of the liver is to ensure that the
blood continually has adequate concentrations of glucose (sugar)
to fuel the brain with energy. The brain cannot burn fat or
protein, only glucose. The first step in this process is
gluconeogenesis, the complex reaction described earlier in which
glucose is formed from pyruvic acid. During gluconeogenesis,
pyruvate also can be synthesized from non-carbohydrate molecules
(such as lactate, glycerol, and amino acids -- the same building
blocks that make up protein). The newly-manufactured glucose can
then either be released into the bloodstream or stored as energy
reserve in the form of glycogen for future use.<br>
Acting as a barometer of liver glucose levels, the vagus nerve
located in the brain is linked to the liver. Specialized nerve
cells involved in this connection monitor the level of glucose
and glycogen in the liver. These nerve cells provide a mechanism
for appetite regulation. Thus, when liver glycogen stores are
low, such as after a fast or during famine, an animal is
compelled to eat a larger amount of food in order to feel
satiated, or full. The decision to eat more is under the
physiological control of nerve cell connections between the liver
and the brain.<br>
Not surprisingly, the Hoffman La Roche scientists found that the
rate of gluconeogenesis nearly doubled in rats treated with
(-)-hydroxycitrate. In other words, the rate at which the liver
could manufacture glucose (in this case from lactate or the amino
acid, alanine) in the presence of (-)-hydroxycitrate was faster
than occurred in control animals which did not receive the
supplement. This meant that the (-)-hydroxycitrate-treated rats
became satiated by consuming less food than did their untreated
counterparts -- the control animals. The increased rate of
gluconeogenesis offered a solid explanation for the appetite
suppression observed in (-)-hydroxycitrate-treated animals. Yet,
subsequent studies, though encouraging for weight control, failed
to clarify the precise physiological mechanisms that could
account for weight loss.<br>
As noted previously, (-)-hydroxycitrate reduced appetite
considerably more than did many appetite-suppressive agents. <br>
In one study, at the end of 80 days, there was a four percent net
reduction in food consumed by rats treated with
(-)-hydroxycitrate. At the same time, however, these animals had
gained 78 percent less weight than the control animals which did
not receive any (-)-hydroxycitrate during this period. This
observation - the most dramatic one reported - along with other
findings indicated that the relatively lower amount of weight
gain was considerably less than expected, given the minimal
change that occurred in the animals&#146; food intake.<br>
In essence, the reduction in weight gain (78 percent) was
disproportionately large when compared to the very small decrease
of four percent in food consumption. Similar findings emerged
from a pair feeding study. When (-)-hydroxycitrate-treated rats
and control rats ingested identical quantities of food each day,
the (-)-hydroxycitrate-treated rats gained substantially less
weight than did the controls. Hydoxycitrate had no obvious effect
on the animals&#146; physical activity. It appears, therefore,
that (-)-hydroxycitrate probably boosted the rats&#146; metabolic
rate. Unfortunately, this hypothesis was never proven because the
scientists failed to make any direct measurements of the
animals&#146; metabolic rate. The notion does, however, provide a
reasonable hypothesis for the mechanism through which
Citrin&#174; --an herbal product containing the stable calcium
salt of (--hydroxycitrate -- inhibits the formation of new body
fat.</p>

<h2>(-)HCA and Fat Burning:</h2>
<p>Possible Biochemical Mechanisms of Action<br>
The studies just described suggest that (-)HCA blocks fatty acid
(as well as cholesterol) biosynthesis by indirectly lowering the
pool of acetyl Coenzyme A. (-)HCA competes with citrate as a
substrate upon which the enzyme, citrate lyase, can act. In the
presence of (-)HCA, citrate cannot be easily converted into
acetyl Coenzyme A and oxaloacetate. The reduced availability of
these two compounds subsequently alters other steps in the
Kreb&#146;s Cycle that accelerate fat-burning in the liver.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2>(-)HCA and Lipid Levels</h2>
<p>In an in vitro (test tube) study, the biosynthesis of
cholesterol dropped 27 percent in liver cells that had been
incubated with (-)-hydroxycitrate when compared to control
values. In a pre-clinical evaluation, serum triglyceride levels
were reduced in fructose-fed non-Zucker rats. The decrease in
serum triglyceride levels were attributed to the ability of
(-)-hydroxycitrate to increase the rate of fatty acid synthesis
in the liver. The findings from these studies indicate that
Citrin&#174; may be an efficacious dietary supplement for helping
to normalize elevated lipid levels.<br>
</p>
<hr>
<h2>(-)HCA and Protein-Sparing</h2>
<p>In a negative calorie balance -- that is, when more calories
are burned than ingested -- stored fat and protein are oxidized
to meet the body&#146;s metabolic demands. It is preferable that
fat rather than protein be burned during this state. But, during
dieting (or restricted caloric intake), up to 30 percent of the
weight reduction can result from the loss of lean protein-rich
tissues, especially skeletal muscle. As scientific studies have
shown, (-)HCA stimulates fat burning while at the same time
slowing the rate at which protein is oxidized. Consequently, the
loss of lean tissue is minimized when (-)HCA is taken as a
dietary supplement during weight reduction programs.<br>
It is always important for the body to preserve lean tissue.
Aside from its cosmetic or aesthetic appeal, lean mass is
critical for health because the basal metabolic rate is roughly
proportional to the amount of lean mass. During successful
dieting, lean mass is conserved. This enables the dieter to
maintain a steady rate of fat loss without having to drastically
reduce the amount of food consumed.<br>
For those who do find it appropriate to diet, (-)HCA accelerates
the loss of body fat without sacrificing excessive loss of lean
mass. The probable protein-sparing benefits of Citrin&#174; are
amplified by an adequate but lower caloric intake of both protein
and complex carbohydrates. Most importantly, a dietary supplement
of Citrin&#174; can help to control appetite, stimulate metabolic
rate, and spare the loss of protein in lean tissues. All of these
effects in concert foster a rapid loss of fat, leading ultimately
to a reduction in the percentage of body fat, and a slimmer,
healthier, and leaner physique.<br>

<h2>Potential Health Benefits of Citrin&#174;</h2>
<p>Many cardiovascular risk factors are associated with abdominal
obesity -- inefficient insulin function, high blood pressure,
high triglyceride levels, and increased blood clotting. These
risk factors are exacerbated by the increased levels of fats
(free fatty acids) in the bloodstream of obese people. The
fat-burning action of (-)HCA seems to reduce the free fatty acid
levels in the blood. In so doing, it may lessen these risk
factors, even before the obesity is corrected. Future studies are
needed to evaluate the clinical effects of (-)HCA on minimizing
cardiovascular risk factors, including reductions in blood
triglyceride levels and in cholesterol synthesis. Other
health-promoting measures can only enhance the potential benefits
of Citrin&#174; on cardiovascular health. Among these are eating
low-fat foods rich in soluble fiber, taking nutritional
supplements such as Chromium Picolinate, and following an aerobic
exercise regimen.<br>
Strategies for managing weight must be realistic and sensible.
&quot;Quick fix&quot; diet gimmicks rarely, if ever, provide
lasting benefits. Obesity can no more be &quot;cured&quot; by
temporary measures than can high blood pressure or diabetes be
miraculously eliminated by &quot;magic bullets&quot; Strategies
for achieving and most importantly, for maintaining a lean
physique must be safe, healthful, and practical for a lifetime
use. Obviously, stimulant drugs touted for weight loss, including
some of those classified as health food supplements, generally
fail to meet this standard. Because products such as Citrin&#174;
which contain a standardized (-)HCA salt favorably influence
these risk factors, thereby promoting cardiovascular health, they
may well be appropriate for long-term and continuous usage.</p>

<h3>CLINICAL EVALUATIONS OF (-)-HYDROXYCITRATE</h3>
<p><em>Anthony Conte, M.D.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Bariatrics: The Medical Profession&#146;s Approach To
Obesity<br>
What is Bariatrician?</strong><br>
<br>
A bariatrician is a physician who specializes in the diagnosis,
prevention and medical treatment of obesity and diseases commonly
associated with this condition such as diabetes, hypertension,
arthritis, hypoglycemia, thyroid disorders and coronary disease.
This subdivision of medical practice follows professional
standards set forth by the American Society of Bariatric
Physicians. Through research, continuing education, and
information exchange, the members of this organization seek to
encourage excellence in the practice of bariatrics. As a
bariatric physician in private practice for 30 years, I am also
an active member and a diplomate of the American Society of
Bariatric Physicians. In addition to my clinical practice of
treating individual patients, I have conducted over 20 clinical
studies on appetite suppressants and meal replacement programs.
Several of these studies, all of them performed in compliance
with FDA regulations, have been published in the medical
literature.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Obesity: The Orphan Disease</h2>
<p><em>&quot;I find that the world is populated by fat people
trying to get thin and by thin people trying to get
thinner.&quot;</em> This curious quote, still apropos for our
era, offered by an anonymous source appeared in a magazine
article written in 1927. Despite the relevance of this statement
for today&#146;s world, many people in the industrialized and
developing world alike apparently do not consider obesity a
serious medical condition.<br>
But the importance of this condition cannot be overstated. The
Journal of the American Medical Association recently issued a
call for American medicine to adopt obesity, an &quot;orphan
disease&quot; (or a disease which the pharmaceutical industry
tends to ignore) rather than leave it to benign neglect. Obesity
affects as many as 80 million people in the United States alone.
Health statistics indicate that this disease causes a tremendous
amount of psychological and familial suffering, as well as social
and economic turmoil. All of these factors directly and
indirectly help to escalate the already accelerating health-care
costs in the United States. In fact, the overall impact of this
condition ranks high on the list of national public health
problems as well as personal health priorities.<br>
On any given day, 50 percent of American women and 25 percent of
American men are dieting in one form or another. Their excess
weight clearly exposes many of them to increased risk of
developing clinical diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular
complications, including heart attacks and strokes, and other
diseases that cost billions of dollars a year in medical
expenses, lost work hours, and disability compensation. Despite
the magnitude of this problem, only recently has medical science
began to take this issue seriously.</p>

<p>As specialists concerned with the health risks and social
stigma associated with obesity, bariatricians are constantly
striving to find more effective and safer treatments for our
patients. Fortunately, advances in basic medical science,
including biochemistry, nutrition, and metabolism, have helped us
to better understand the nature of obesity. A more detailed
clarification of the body processes that control the distribution
of fat and nutrients throughout various organs of the body may
foster the development of novel approaches to this chronic
problem.<br>
In some patients, a medically approved appetite suppressant drug
may be the best solution. Just as encouraging a dependency on
diet pills is absurd, so too is it ludicrous to assume that every
case of obesity can and must be treated without medication.
Bariatric physicians, therefore, are in continual search for
government approved, safe, and efficacious medications for
obesity that can be used judiciously to treat those patients who
could benefit from such therapy.<br>
Drug development designed to combat obesity will entail a
full-scale effort of basic and applied research by university
research scientists, pharmaceutical scientists in private
industry, clinical physicians, nutritionists, allied health
professionals, and the developers of all-natural herbal extracts.
The importance of the latter group, herbal researchers and
manufacturers, has been ignored and overshadowed for far too long
in the field of weight management.<br>
In addition, the United States Government can assist in the
development of safer and more efficacious treatments for obesity
by assigning it a higher priority for government-sponsored
research funding. National public health education campaigns can
elevate the consciousness of lay consumers about proper
nutrition, sensible eating habits, and other measures that may
have a favorable impact on preventing many cases of obesity. As
bariatricians, those of us who have dedicated our lives to this
field feel obligated to encourage other biomedical specialists
and researchers to become actively involved in this neglected
field.<br>
I have participated in several clinical studies evaluating the
efficacy and side-effects of anorexics: amphetamines,
phendimetrazine, phentermine, mazindol, diethylproprion and
phenylpropanolamine. Most consumers have heard of these drugs
under their various trade names. It is my experience that these
appetite suppressants can be safe and effective in a weight
control program when they are used selectively and monitored
carefully by a knowledgeable physician. These medications should
be used only as a component of a well-planned,
individually-designed or custom-tailored program that includes a
balanced and sensible diet accompanied by appropriate physical
exercise. Yet, even medical professionals disagree over the
optimal length of time for which appetite suppressants should be
used in a weight loss program. In my judgment, medication should
not be restricted to only 12 weeks out of a year if the patient
requires active treatment with pharmaceuticals for a longer
period of time. Lengthy use of appetite-inhibiting or fat-burning
drugs can be appropriate if the therapy is free of adverse side
reactions and if it fosters healthier changes in lifestyle
habits.<br>
In 1992, Dr. Michael Weintraub and his colleagues at the
University of Rochester School of Medicine concluded that
prescription appetite suppressants can help obese people to lose
weight and keep weight off. Their four-year study demonstrated
that obesity should be treated as a chronic disease, comparable
to high blood pressure and arthritis. The medical profession
recommends that in chronic diseases (often called the
&quot;diseases of civilization&quot;), drugs can be taken
indefinitely, if necessary, in order to minimize the symptoms.
Yet, in spite of the medical justification for using
pharmaceuticals to treat certain cases of obesity, this does not
mean that effective, alternative, or non-pharmaceutical methods
of treating this condition do not exist. They do, in fact, and I
have spent many years of my professional career conducting
research on the pros and cons of non-drug, all-natural appetite
suppressants.</p>
<hr>
<h2>CLINICAL RESEARCH STUDIES</h2>
<h2><em>Background</em></h2>
<p>During the last five years, I have conducted three studies on
natural weight-loss aids. All of these diet aids contained two
active ingredients, (-)-hydroxycitrate (the active ingredient in
Citrin&#174;), and chromium (GTF). The results of all of these
studies were impressive. (-)-Hydroxycitrate is the active
principle extracted from the rind of the fruit known as Garcinia
cambogia and Garcinia indica. In several pre-clinical
assessments, it has been shown to be an appetite suppressant as
well as a lipid lowering agent through its inhibition of fat
synthesis (or fatty acid production.)<br>
When (-)-hydroxycitrate is given as a supplement with meals,
dietary carbohydrate seems more easily converted into glycogen
which is then stored in the muscles and in the liver. The result
of these increased glycogen stores is enhanced stamina and
endurance without any increase in body weight, especially body
stores of fat. On a biochemical level, the overall effect of
(-)-hydroxycitrate is a reduction of acetyl Coenzyme A, the major
source of carbon atoms available for the synthesis of lipids.
(-)-Hydroxycitrate, therefore, lowers blood levels of
triglycerides and cholesterol, and it decreases body fat stores
without causing a decline in energy output.<br>
Chromium (GTF) is a key mineral that &quot;keeps insulin levels
in check&quot; by making the hormone more efficient at regulating
blood sugar levels. In two clinical studies, patients were
administered a combination of Citrin&#174; (standardized to
contain 250 mg of the calcium salt of (-)-hydroxycitrate) and 100
mcg of chromium. This supplement, which was taken three times a
day, one half-hour before meals, is ideal because of the
synergistic actions that take place between (-)-hydroxycitrate
and chromium.<br>
This combination represents a workable alternative to drugs used
for weight loss. Beneficial to both the patients and the
physician, the Citrin&#174;-Chromium Picolinate combination is
capable of enhancing any dietary and exercise program by
facilitating easier and more substantial weight loss. Of equal
importance, it does not interfere with the chemical actions of
other medications. Affordable in price and commercially available
through herbal manufacturers, it can be used by a wide
cross-section of individuals from different socio-economic
levels. Finally, my research consistently showed that compliance
with this treatment and the recommended diets was high in the
majority of individuals who participated in my clinical
evaluations of this product.<br>
In all three of the following studies described below, this
combination of weight loss enhancers, an herbal extract
containing the calcium salt of (-)HCA and chromium, was used in
conjunction with the Smart Choice Diet. I designed this diet as a
special nutritional regimen to accompany the
Citrin&#174;-chromium supplement. The Smart Choice Diet consists
of low-fat, low-sugar, low-sodium foods eaten in three ordinary
meals. The overall program which I advocate combines the diet and
weight loss enhancers with sensible daily exercise such as
walking. In most cases, it successfully led to gradual, safe
weight loss that stayed off, decreased body fat, increased lean
body mass and, as a favorable side-effect, made for a healthier,
happier lifestyle.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Hilton Head Study: Lipodex-2</h2>
<p>In this eight-week, double-blind study conducted in 1991 in
Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, 54 subjects who participated
in the study were each seen weekly by me in my office. Over the
course of the study period, Lipodex-2 (a supplement containing 50
mg Garcinia cambogia extract and an amino acid chelate of
chromium and niacin) was taken by all 30 participants in the test
group before each meal. The remaining 24 subjects took a placebo
(an inert &quot;sugar&quot; pill) before they ate each meal.<br>
The 22 subjects in the test group who took Lipodex-2 lost an
average of 11.1 pound per person, while the 17 subjects who took
a placebo dropped 4.2 pounds per person. All volunteers in the
study were encouraged to adhere to the Smart Choice Diet,
consisting of low-fat renditions of their usual meals, and drink
64 ounces of water daily. The foods and the ways in which they
were prepared emphasized variety, moderation, and balance. All of
the participants were encouraged to follow a daily regimen of
sensible and appropriate exercise.<br>
The Lipodex-2 group consistently showed better compliance with
the instructions for the program. They also had a higher level of
energy, a greater level of appetite suppression, and reduced
cravings for sweets than did the placebo group. Decreases in the
levels of serum cholesterol and triglyceride were also observed.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Allendale Study: Lipotrol/Actotherm</h2>
<p>This 8-week study, conducted in 1993, initially enrolled 128
volunteers who were to take three different medications: 30
participants were scheduled to receive Actotherm (a supplement
which does not contain (-)-hydroxycitrate; 45 participants were
administered a combination therapy of Lipotrol and Actotherm; and
44 received Lipotrol. Out of 95 subjects who actually completed
the study, 88 subjects lost 849 pounds or an average of 9.65
pounds per person. The specific weight loss average for each
study group is listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Lipotrol*: 11.48 lbs. per person (29 subjects)</li>
    <li>Lipotrol and Actotherm: 9.52 lbs. per person (35
        subjects)</li>
    <li>Actotherm: 6.65 lbs. per person (29 subjects)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
    <p>*Lipotrol contains Citrin&#174;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The procedures and instructions for this study were identical
to those used in the previously described Lipodex-2 study, with
the exception that placebos were not used in the Allendale study.
Also, in contrast to the Hilton Head Study, individuals taking
routine medications were not excluded from the Allendale Study.
Hunger levels were markedly depressed, energy levels increased,
sugar cravings were reduced, and lipid levels were lowered in
participants who took Lipotrol or a combination of Lipotrol and
Actotherm. In some cases, the changes in these variables were
dramatic. Furthermore, no negative interactions were observed
between the test supplements and other medications which some of
the study volunteers were taking for other conditions.</p>

<h2>Hilton Head Study: Citrin&#174; 75</h2>
<p>In 1994, we conducted an eight-week study on 75 volunteers
taking Citrin&#174;75 (a supplement consisting of 250 mg
(-)-hydroxycitrate and 100&Ecirc;mcg chromium from Chromium
Picolinate). The study group included 60 women and 15 men who
ranged in age from 21 to 65 years, and in weight from 135.5 to
253 pounds.<br>
All subjects were in reasonably good health when the project
began. However, 74 percent had abnormal blood chemistry (mainly
in the form of elevated lipid levels) and 53 percent were taking
one or more prescription drugs for medical conditions primarily
associated with elevated lipid levels and body overweight. Before
the study started, only two volunteers showed detectable chromium
in their blood. Despite the &quot;normal&quot; diet most
participants claimed to be following before our study began,
their plasma levels indicated a virtual absence of this important
trace mineral. As many people are now well aware of, chromium,
which is required by the body to regulate blood sugar, helps
prevent hyperglycemia that can lead to diabetes mellitus.<br>
The identical protocol (described for the previous studies)
consisting of sensible eating habits as specified in the Smart
Choice Diet, adequate dietary water intake, and laboratory work
and monitoring was used, along with a dietary supplement of
Citrin&#174; which was taken before each meal. Patient profiles
taken during this study involved compliance monitoring and blood
chemistry panels, including an analysis of plasma chromium
levels.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Summary of Results</h2>
<p>a) Forty-two (42) subjects who completed the study and for who
the laboratory data were available lost an average of 10.80
pounds per person.<br>
b) Only two (2) out of the 42 subjects had any detectable plasma
chromium levels. At the end of the eight week period, all 42
subjects had significant and measurable levels of chromium in
their plasma.<br>
c) Ten (10) subjects whose laboratory data are still being
evaluated lost an average of 10.60 pounds per person.<br>
d) Another six (6) subjects who stayed on the program for only
six weeks lost only 5.8 pounds per person for that period.<br>
e) The study had a total attrition of 17 subjects who dropped out
for various personal reasons.<br>
f) Of the 42 subjects who completed the study, 11 showed
statistically significant reductions in their cholesterol levels.
Cholesterol levels increased moderately in nine cases and
remained unaltered in 22 cases.<br>
g) Triglyceride levels dropped in 11 cases (statistically
significant) and were elevated moderately in six cases. In the
remaining cases, the changes observed were not significant.<br>
h) Glucose levels were reduced significantly in eight cases,
slightly elevated in two cases, and virtually unchanged in 30
cases.<br>
i) It is reasonable to conclude that Citrin&#174; plus Chromium
Picolinate in the doses used in this study and in combination
with an appropriate diet and exercise plan can facilitate weight
loss.</p>
<hr>
<h2>SAFETY OF CITRIN&#174;</h2>
<p><em>Muhammed Majeed, Ph.D.</em></p>
<p>Citrin&#174; has been tested and approved by manufacturers in
the United States and Europe as a safe and efficacious product.
It is the only herbal supplement derived from Garcinia cambogia
to have undergone human clinical trials in the U.S.A. Its potency
is guaranteed through state-of-the-art HPLC.<br>
The LD50 Value of (-)HCA is &gt; 2000 mg/kg for intraperitonial
administration and &gt; 4000 mg/kg for oral administration.
Tolerance to anorexic, or appetite suppressant drugs, usually
develops over time. This is a common feature in Central Nervous
System (CNS)-stimulant drugs such as amphetamines and other
phenylethylamine derivatives. In contrast, tolerance to
Citrin&#174; in pre-clinical studies was minimal. In one
investigation, (-)-hydroxycitrate continued to lower the amount
of food consumed through the 80-day duration of the trial. Other
anorexic agents such as Fenfluramine were effective for appetite
only after the first few days, but not beyond that period of
time.<br>
(-)-Hydroxycitrate does not affect respiration, phosphorylation,
or the citrate synthesis of the reconstituted mitochondria. This
compound lowers the rate of lipogenesis (or the rate at which the
body forms new fat) in a dose-dependent manner in the liver,
adipose (fat) tissue, and the small intestine. However,
(-)-hydroxycitrate neither penetrates the mitochondria nor
affects normal energy production.<br>
As an herbal product containing standardized (-)HCA, Citrin&#174;
offers a safe alternative to appetite-suppressant substances that
overactivate the sympathetic nervous system, produce only short
term anorexia, and carry the risk of being addictive. Unlike
pharmaceutical agents and most other nutrient and herbal products
on the market, Citrin&#174; decreases food intake, diminishes
appetite, and accelerates the burning of fatty acids without
adverse side effects. These features make Citrin&#174; a viable
choice for efficaciously treating obesity and overweightness.</p>
<hr>
<h3><strong>WEIGHT CONTROL: A BARIATRICIAN&#146;S POINT OF VIEW</strong></h3>
<p><em>Anthony Conte, M.D.</em></p>
<h3>Why Do Some People Get Fat While Others Don&#146;t?</h3>
<p>There is an increasing number of theories &Ntilde; most of
them speculative &Ntilde; about weight gain and the manner in
which calories are ingested and burned. We are all aware of the
many non-obese people who overeat, especially consuming huge
quantities of carbohydrates, for extended periods of time without
gaining any weight. However, even in individuals who maintain
stable weight, this pattern ultimately is costly to normal
health. Given a long enough period of time, excessive intake of
carbohydrates will lead to excess storage of body fat. This
occurs because over consumption of glucose-containing foods
increases the body&#146;s production of lipogenic, or
fat-storing, enzymes such as lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Once this
chemical action can be safely blocked without disrupting any of
the body&#146;s other normal processes, then most weight problems
can be brought under control.<br>
Simple refined sugars, including fructose which is often touted
as a natural sugar since it is found in fruit, are always a
problem for weight management. Indeed, there is growing evidence
that fructose stimulates lipogenesis, or fat storage, even more
than does glucose. White sugar is composed of two glucose
molecules joined together. Fructose is converted even more
rapidly into glucose than is white, or refined sugar. Fructose,
present in fruit juices, corn syrups, and many so-called
&quot;health food products,&quot; causes an unhealthy rise in the
levels of liver enzymes, insulin, and blood triglycerides.<br>
Physical activity is of course critical to proper weight
management. Metabolic rate, the ratio of lean to fatty body mass,
and genetic factors (or individual heredity) in combination with
physical activity have bearing on how successful -- or
unsuccessful body fat reduction will be. Equally important to
weight management are the degree, duration, and timing of
overeating. When physical exercise is closely coupled with the
timing of excessive eating, then the negative consequences of
potential weight gain are minimized. People who diet without
exercising tend to lose mainly water and in some cases, muscle
tissue; but, individuals who exercise and eat a sensible and
balanced diet low in simple sugars are able to effectively shed
excess weight, and, most importantly, keep it off for sustained
periods of time.<br>
I have used various Citrin&#174;-based products to treat numerous
cases of overweightness in my medical practice. I have found
unequivocally from the case studies I have followed and the
clinical studies I have conducted that Citrin&#174; is a safe and
effective natural alternative to allopathic drugs for promoting
weight loss.</p>

<h2>Myths Versus Facts in Obesity: A Reality Check</h2>
<p>In my practice as a bariatrician, I often have to dispel myths
that seem to persist in the face of growing scientific evidence.
Frequently, I am asked recurrent questions relating to weight
loss. These myths and questions come up so often from patients
that I thought it worthwhile to present them here with what I
think are realistic responses or counter-proposals. It is hoped
that the factual rebuttals to common myths, or misconceptions,
about dieting and weight loss and the answers to common queries
about this subject will assist the reader in choosing a weight
management program that is optimal for him or her.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Common Myths About Losing Weight</h2>
<p><strong>Myth:</strong> <em>Prescription &quot;diet pills&quot;
are bad for you.</em><br>
<strong>Fact: </strong>As is the case for all drugs, diet pills
can be beneficial if used with proper judgment and if monitored
by a trained medical professional. The selection of an
appropriate medication, the dosage, and the duration of its use
should be monitored by a qualified physician who evaluates its
appropriateness on the basis of the patient&#146;s degree of
excess weight, overall health needs, eating patterns, and
lifestyle.<br>
<br>
<strong>Myth:</strong> <em>A diet pill makes you lose weight.</em><br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> Diet medication does not make a person
lose weight. However, because it suppresses appetite, it may help
a person avoid cravings and eat less. A sensible eating strategy
that is easy to &quot;stick to&quot; must consist of variety,
moderation and balance. A diet is essentially a lifestyle
modification -- a gradual change in eating habits that
incorporates the proper mix of proteins, fruits, vegetables,
grains, and dairy products for optimal nutrition, lean body mass,
and preventive medicine. Radical departures from normal eating
habits, such as following a very low calorie diet or ingesting a
&quot;milkshake&quot; diet as a replacement for every meal are
not sensible courses of action to follow. These practices
represent unnatural ways of eating, quickly leaving dieters
bored, frustrated, and ready to sacrifice their will power.<br>
<br>
<strong>Myth:</strong> <em>Fasting is the best way to lose
weight.</em><br>
<strong>Fact:</strong> Fasting for more than four days without
medical supervision can damage kidney and liver functions and
change the chemical balance in the blood. Weight loss through
fasting is more apt to be retained because it results from a
&quot;crash diet&quot; effect rather than from developing
sensible eating habits.<br>
<br>
<strong>Myth:</strong> <em>Calories do not count.</em><br>
<strong>Fact: </strong>Yes, Calories do count. Excess weight
results from eating, or taking in, more calories than a person
expends as energy in exercise and other daily physical
activities. If a person uses up more calories than he takes in,
he loses weight.<br>
However, not all calories are created equal, as shown in the
following table:</p>
<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><u>Calorie Source</u> <u>Calories per Gram </u></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Carbohydrate .................. 4</p>
        <p>Protein ............................ 4</p>
        <p>Alcohol .......................... 7</p>
        <p>Fat .................................. 9<br>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever possible, it is advisable to eat carbohydrates and
proteins instead of fats. A full 98 percent of the calorie
content of fat goes into storage as body fat, and only two
percent is used in digestion. In contrast, complex carbohydrates
and proteins burn up 23 percent of their total calorie content in
the process of digestion.<br>
<br>
<strong>Myth:</strong> <em>Everyone who loses weight gains it all
back sooner or later.</em><br>
<strong>Fact: </strong>Long-term weight loss is possible, but it
requires that a person learn new ways of eating and living. It
means making a lifetime commitment to a safe and clinically
effective program (which, in some people, will involve careful
monitoring by clinical staff). There is no &quot;quick fix&quot;
to improving one&#146;s health and appearance. In order to be
successful, an individual must have perseverance and unstinting
determination to reach and maintain his or her desired weight and
shape. Only the dieter can make it happen.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Ask a Bariatrician. The Questions I Hear Most Often</h2>
<p><strong>Question #1:</strong> <em>Are there any
&quot;secrets&quot; to weight-loss and maintenance?</em><br>
<strong>Response #1:</strong> The answers are all too obvious -
eat right, eat light, and exercise. Too often people adopt a
frantic, &quot;Lose It Now&quot; mentality to weight loss as they
unrealistically seek instant results. But slimming down for good
is a gradual process. Slow weight loss occurs over months as a
person learns to adapt to the changes of a new and improved
lifestyle.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question #2:</strong> <em>Only one in 12 people can lose
weight and keep it off. Why do so many people fail?</em><br>
<strong>Response #2:</strong> The most common cause of failure
stems from the daily ritual of stepping onto the scale, not
seeing &quot;instant&quot; results, and becoming discouraged at
the lack of an immediate drop of that little pointer.
Unfortunately, many people give up entirely because they miss the
most important goals of weight loss. The true goal should be to
lose excess fat while not sacrificing lean body mass. Healthy
weight loss should improve all bodily functions and be free of
dehydration, or loss of body fluids.<br>
About 73 percent of people who design their own diets instead of
using a formal program lose weight and keep it off. I believe
this occurs because people on self-designed diets include many of
their favorite foods (though perhaps in smaller amounts).
Including foods they enjoy makes it easier for them to comply
with their own self-regulated weight management programs. In
addition, when individuals develop their own diet plans, they
tend to set more modest, realistic goals for themselves that make
it easier to adhere to changes in eating habits.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question #3:</strong> <em>Why do so many diets include
eight glasses of water a day?</em><br>
<strong>Response #3:</strong> A vital component of a weight loss
diet is an adequate intake of water. When the body burns 16
ounces of fat, it generates about 22 ounces of water which must
be flushed. The ideal way to do this is to drink more water. If a
person drinks less than 64 ounces of water, his body reacts to
this as a threat to survival, and therefore holds on to every
drop. Some of the unfortunate consequences of this are swelling
in the feet, ankles, legs, and hands, as well as a slowing down
in the rate at which weight drops.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question #4:</strong> <em>Does exercise increase
appetite?</em><br>
<strong>Response #4: </strong>No. Studies have shown that the
level of appetite is greatest in a sedentary person or when a
person exercises strenuously; but, the appetite falls
dramatically to a very low level when a person exercises
moderately. As in designing one&#146;s own diet, one&#146;s
choice of exercise ideally should be something enjoyable, fun,
and realistic. A person is more likely to engage in an exercise
routine on an ongoing basis if he likes it. The goal of exercise
should not be strenuous, but rather regular, graded, vigorous
physical activity. By improving circulation, exercise stimulates
the body while reducing both bodily and psychological stress.
Exercise burns up excess calories, builds lean body tissue,
lowers fat in the blood, and helps to stabilize blood sugar.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question #5</strong>: <em>What about medically supervised
liquid diet programs (VLCD) that we hear about celebrities using?</em><br>
<strong>Response #5:</strong> These sorts of diets originally
were intended for people who are at least 40 pounds overweight
(or more than 30 percent above their recommended weight). Such
diets are potentially dangerous, however. They should be
undertaken only with medical supervision and should not continue
beyond 12 weeks.<br>
The cost of these programs can be very high, averaging as much as
$180 for every pound of weight loss. When one adds to this cost
the fact that nearly all patients following these types of diet
regained most of their weight, it suggests that they are not
optimal weight management plans. This finding again shows that a
weight loss program must involve fundamental changes in eating
habits with which an individual can live comfortably for the rest
of his or her life.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question #6:</strong> <em>Are new drugs being developed
for the treatment of obesity?</em><br>
<strong>Response #6:</strong> Yes. As the medical profession
amasses more knowledge of the body mechanisms involved in
obesity, we gain insights into new approaches that may help to
remedy this condition. The use of complementary drugs -- such as
digestive aids, lipolytic agents, metabolic correctors,
thermogenic substances, and nutritional supplements -- in
conjunction with medical care offer new and potentially rewarding
therapeutic regimens for obesity.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question #7:</strong> <em>What is Orlistat? Why was it
called a &quot;dream drug?&quot;</em><br>
<strong>Response #7:</strong> Orlistat (its chemical name is
tetrahydrolipstatin), developed by Hoffman-LaRoche Laboratories
appears to have the same properties as an appetite suppressant
and a lipid lowering agent as does (-)-hydroxycitrate, the active
ingredient in Citrin&#174;. This is not surprising in light of
the fact that the early experimental work conducted on animals
given (-)-hydroxycitrate was done at Hoffman LaRoche Laboratories
in the 1970s. However, because (-)-hydroxycitrate, as an extract
of a natural product, could not be patented at that time,
research on this molecule may have been halted. It is noteworthy
that researchers at this major pharmaceutical company are now
resuming their studies on (-)-hydroxycitrate as a model for a
patentable, &quot;synthetic&quot; pharmaceutical agent.<br>
In a recent study, 100 Americans who took Orlistat and followed a
light diet lost an average of 11 pounds over a three month
period. This weight loss was nearly twice as much as the weight
loss that occurred in the control group.<br>
Our own results with Citrin&#174;, a commercial product
containing (-)-hydroxycitrate, and chromium in clinical
evaluations have shown a similar weight loss in eight weeks. Side
effects were not observed in subjects taking Citrin&#174;,
regardless of the medications they may have been taking at the
same time. An ambitious two-year study on Orlistat involving
4,000 subjects in Europe and the United States is currently
underway. Since clinical trials must be conducted over a long
period of time, it may be several years before Orlistat is
approved for sale in the United States. Moreover, if and when it
does, it will be available by prescription only. In the interim,
a safe and efficacious, all-natural product, Citrin&#174;, which
may be at least as effective as Orlistat for body fat reduction
and weight loss, is currently on the market.<br>
<br>
<strong>Question #8:</strong> <em>There seems to be many
different all-natural weight loss enhancers. How do I know which
companies offer genuine products?</em><br>
<strong>Response #8:</strong> Assessing the legitimacy and
authenticity of claims made about various products is an ongoing
process. I suggest that the consumer carefully read labels,
scrutinize the level of scientific assertions made by the company
and its researchers, and consult with a medically trained
physician or health professional. An interested individual should
not be afraid to call or write to the manufacturer with his
questions. An honest firm will be glad to answer questions and
admit any limitations or inconclusive findings about their
products. In addition, it is appropriate to request from a
manufacturer copies of research studies evaluating the quality
and effects of the weight-loss product.</p>
