<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>XI -- TURKEY AND PERSIA </h2>

<hr>

<p>NEXT to India, the greatest two opium-producing countries in
the world are Turkey and Persia. The Statesman's Year Book for
1918 has this to say about it. On page 1334: &quot;The principal
exports from Turkey into the United Kingdom..... in two years
were:<br>
</p>

<p><img src="img00007.gif" align="bottom" width="333"

<p>These are the only articles mentioned in this list of chief
exports. There are others, doubtless, but the Statesman's Year
Book is a condensed and compact little volume, dealing only with
the principal things exported. In i9i5 we therefore notice that
the opium export was second on the list, being exceeded by but
one other, dried fruit. In i9i6, the third year of the war, the
opium export is decidedly less, as are all the other articles
exported, except dried fruit and wool-which were articles
probably more vital to the United Kingdom at that time even than
opium. </p>

<p>PERSIA </p>

<p>THE same authority, the Statesman's Year Book for 1918, gives
a table on page 1162, showing the value of the chief exports from
Persia. The values are given in thousands of kran, sixty kran
equaling one pound sterling. <br>

<p>Since the war, both Turkey and Persia are more or less under
control of the British Empire, which gives Great Britain virtual
control of the world's output of opium. With this monopoly of the
opium-producing countries, and with a million or so square miles
added to her immense colonial Empire, one wonders what use Great
Britain will make of the mandatory powers she has assumed over
the lives and welfare of all these subject peoples! Will she find
these helpless millions ready for her opium trade? Will she
establish opium shops, and opium divans, and reap half the costs
of upkeep of these newly acquired states by means of this
shameful traffic?<br>
