According to the results of a pilot study conducted by British researcher Margaret
Moss, M.A., taking oral molybdenum over a 28 day period produces a &quot;statistically
significant improvement&quot; in patients with arthritis and other aches and pains as well
as in their general health. Moss monitored 14 middle-aged people with symptoms of
arthritis, low back pain, frozen shoulder, rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, as they
took 400-500 &micro;g daily (in 4-5 doses of 100 &micro;g) of molybdenum amino acid
chelate. 

<P>Molybdenum, an essential micronutrient found in whole grains and red cabbage, is
necessary for making key enzymes needed for detoxification. After 28 days, everyone
on the trial felt better: toe and foot pain decreased, cramps and rheumatic pain
declined, and the sense of well-being increased.

A 14 year old girl came to William Douglass Campbell, M.D., of Atlanta, Georgia,
with severe asthma. She couldn't speak, she was sweating profusely, she looked pale
and terrified, and she was straining to breathe-she was having a
life-threatening asthma attack. Five years of taking a conventional drug had brought
no improvement and left her chronically sleepy. 

<P>Dr. Campbell immediately put the girl on an intravenous hydrogen peroxide drip. Then,
drawing 100 milliliters of her blood, he exposed it to ultraviolet light, then
reinfused it into her blood stream. Within 2 hours, the girl was 50% better and by
the next morning her parents told Dr. Campbell she was perfectly recovered. Two years
later she remained asthma-free. &quot;The combination of hydrogen peroxide and treating
the drawn blood with ultraviolet light is called Photox (or photophoresis) treatment
and has been available as a safe, proven, and effective medical treatment since
1920,&quot; says Dr. Campbell.

According to Hiroaki Nanba, Ph.D., of Kobe Pharmaceutical University in Japan, of all
the mushrooms he has studied, maitake mushroom has the strongest activity in tumor
growth inhibition. In mice studies, maitake mushroom, given orally, produced a total
remission in tumors in 40% of the animals, and a 90% suppression rate in the others.
Not only can maitake stop tumors from growing further, but it can halt cancer
formation and metastasis, Dr. Nanba reported. Preliminary studies also indicate
maitake is effective against Kaposi's sarcoma, which affects about 40% of people with
AIDS. The active ingredients in maitake apparently do not directly destroy cancer
cells; rather, they 
activate the immune system and its self-healing powers.

<P>Charles H. Farr, M.D., Ph.D., has treated hundreds of patients with chronic
systemic candida, or yeast infection, using intravenous hydrogen peroxide, at his
clinic in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. 

<P> A woman, age 34, had been suffering with systemic yeast infection for 5 years and
had taken a barrage of antibiotics and practiced rotation and elimination diets, to
no effect. She had vaginal yeast infection, intermittent diarrhea, headaches, acne,
lethargy, joint pain, mental confusion, menstrual irregularities, and had been unable
to work for 2 years. 

<P>Dr. Farr started her on once weekly intravenous infusions of hydrogen peroxide; after
only 2 treatments, she reported feeling more alert and able to concentrate better and
that she was feeling much better. After the third treatment, her complexion started
to improve, all signs of her vaginitis disappeared, and her bowel function became
normal.  After 8 treatments, she was free of all the symptoms that had plagued her
for 5 years; and after 2 more months, she went job-hunting.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>
CATARACTS</CENTER></H2>
<P>Numerous recent studies show that taking multivitamins significantly reduces the
chance of developing cataracts. A study involving 17,744 U.S. doctors showed a 27%
reduced risk in developing cataracts while on multivitamins. 

<P>More specifically, a study among 121,700 nurses proved that taking vitamins and
eating antioxidant-rich foods makes a big difference.  Women who took 14,588 I.U. of
beta-carotene daily (a precursor of vitamin A) showed a 30% reduced risk of getting
cataracts; nurses who took more than 700 mg daily of vitamin C for an extended period
(up to 10 years), had a 45% reduction in cataract risk. When they consumed high
levels of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, plus riboflavin from dietary sources (not
supplements), their cataract risk was reduced by 40%.

<P>Similarly, nurses who ate spinach or other leafy greens at least 5 times a week
registered a 47-65% lower risk of cataracts. Recent 5-year Chinese studies showed
that adults aged 65-74 who took multivitamins regularly had a 36% reduced risk;
taking riboflavin and niacin supplements gave them a 44% lower risk. A Canadian study
with 300 subjects demonstrated that people who took 400 I.U. of vitamin E and 300-600
mg of vitamin C reduced their cataract risk by 50%. The key vitamins with which to
keep your body well stocked as a preventive measure  against cataracts are vitamins
C, E, and A (beta carotene). 

<P>In addition, dietary fortification with N-acetyl-cysteine of at least 30 mg per 2.2
pounds of body weight per day is recommended. This is an amino acid that enhances
body levels of glutathione, a protein-substance essential to preventing cataracts;
low bodily amounts are linked with cataracts.

Dysplasia is a gynecological  condition, sometimes a precursor to cancer, in
which cells in the cervix become abnormal or displaced. A 43-year-old woman consulted
Farida Sharan, M.D., N.D., after receiving a clinical diagnosis of cervical
dysplasia. Six weeks before her scheduled laser surgery, she wanted to use natural
medicines to avert the operation. 

<P>Dr. Sharan prescribed a series of  herbal formulas. These included a  mixture for the
lymphatics:  equal amounts of Echinacea, lobelia, mullein, poke root, burdock,
cayenne, chaparral. These were taken in dry powder form at a total dosage of 8 ounces
over 1 month. Dr. Sharan also prescribed a formula to rejuvenate the intestines,
comprising: Cascara sagrada, ginger root, goldenseal, slippery elm, turkey rhubarb,
wahoo, parsley root. These were also taken in dry powder form at a  total dosage of 8
ounces over 1 month.

<P>In addition, Dr. Sharan prescribed saw palmetto (for the patient's breast fibroids),
plus additional herbal formulas for inflammation of the reproductive area. The
patient started douching with the herb, yellow dock. After 6 weeks on the program,
her condition turned around entirely and she no longer needed surgery.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>EBOLA VIRUS</CENTER></H2>
<P>In case you've been worried or even terrified after watching the movie <I>Outbreak</I> or
reading the bestseller, <I>The Hot Zone,</I> in which there is no apparent cure for the
lethal Ebola virus that causes fatal body-wide hemorrhaging, the Digest is happy to
inform you that this is not the case. Some 4000 peer-reviewed articles suggest that
using oxidative therapy would be the best, fastest, and most reliable way to handle
the Ebola  problem. 

<P>According to William Lee Cowden, M.D., oxidative therapy (using hydrogen peroxide or
ozone) is one way to eradicate viruses, fungi, bacteria, even certain kinds of
parasites, from the body. A patient with influenza, for example, who receives an
intravenous drip of hydrogen peroxide (at a very weak dilution) will in a few hours
have no flu symptoms at all. The same should work with Ebola (and any infectious
microorganism) because the oxygen kills all organisms that lack the ability to
concentrate their own free radical scavengers, an ability that every human cell has.
Most physicians who use oxidative therapy recommend taking vitamin C, beta carotene,
and other antioxidants before and after treatment to prevent damage to human cells
from the oxidative therapy.

stiffness, high fever, extreme weakness, and altered consciousness. The diagnosis:
acute viral encephalitis, which is an inflammation of the brain. 

<P>After 3 days, the hospital released her with 2 prescription medicines but when she
showed up at her homeopath's office, she wasn't feeling much better. In fact, she was
so exhausted they nearly had to carry her into the examining room. Her head felt
severely swollen, she had constant pain, nausea, chills and hot flashes; she had 
little appetite and was generally miserable.

<P>Larry Herdener, N.D., her naturopathic homeopath, gave her herbs to support her
immune function, including echinacea, hydrastis, garlic, and thymus glandulars; he
prescribed an electrolyte replacement sports drink, a balanced  meal supplement, plus
one dose of homeopathic deadly nightshade (belladonna 200c).

<P>In just 2 days she felt 70% better, and in 4 days, after more rest and good food, she

Clinical aromatherapist Peter Holmes, L.Ac., M.H., practicing in Boulder,
Colorado, was brought a 23-month-old infant with a fever, enlarged tonsils, nasal
discharges, pain, inflammation, and infection on her left side where she had been
bitten by another infant. An M.D. had diagnosed cellulitis (tissue inflammation
marked by redness, pain, and swelling) with an upper respiratory infection and had
recommended antibiotics, but the mother had declined them.

<P>Dr. Holmes prescribed a series of essential oils for both systemic and topical
treatment. First, he gave the infant a mixture of tea tree, lavender, and calendula
oils (mixed as 1 drop of each oil in a feeding bottle of fruit juice) 3 times daily
to reduce the infection and fever and stimulate immune response. Then he prepared a
liniment from the same oils (using a 10% dilution in jojoba oil) which the mother
massaged onto the infant's chest twice daily. 

<P>Second, Dr. Holmes mixed together lavender, Moroccan blue chamomile, and calendula
oils (in a 20% dilution in jojoba oil) to be applied on the infected skin 6 times a
day. Third, he instructed the mother in how to make a lemon oil calf wrap to keep the
child's fever down. The lemon oil wrap is made by immersing a washcloth in lemon oil
(1% dilution) in cold water, then wrapping it around the knees and calves for
absorption through the skin.

<P>By the next morning, the fever was gone, and in 2 days, the pain, redness, and
swelling were reduced; after 2 more days, the tonsil symptoms were gone, and the
child was completely recovered.
