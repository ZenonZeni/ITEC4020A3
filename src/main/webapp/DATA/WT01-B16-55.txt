<body><h2>Appendix C<br>
Site-Specific Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Strategy</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Introduction</h4><p>

<a href="./ch22.htm"><em>Section 2.2</em> </a>of the Program Plan, Revision 1, describes activities to acquire the capability for
waste acceptance, storage, and transportation, which will be conducted prior to interim storage
facility site designation under the Program's revised strategy. This appendix describes the waste
acceptance, interim storage, and transportation activities currently planned to begin once a
facility site is designated.
<p>
<h4>Planning Assumptions</h4>
<p>
Plans for activities following interim storage facility site designation are based on the following
assumptions:
<p>
<ul>
<li> The $85 million reserved in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of
1996 will be requested by the Administration and will be made available in Fiscal Year 1998
appropriations for non-site specific activities. 
<li>Legislation designating an interim storage site will be enacted approximately six months
after the 1998 completion of the Yucca Mountain viability assessment.
<li>Site-specific work on a Federal interim storage facility will be initiated with Fiscal Year
1999 funding.
<li> Design, licensing, and construction will take approximately three and one-half years
following designation of a site for interim storage, assuming the necessary funding is provided to
develop a topical safety analysis report and conduct related design and analysis work.
<li>Interim storage facility legislation will be enacted which:<br>
-    authorizes implementation in two phases to facilitate the earliest possible
acceptance of waste;<br>
 -    requires separate environmental reports for each phase of construction;<br>
 -    allows construction of an interim storage facility to begin as soon as the license
application is submitted; and<br>
 -    directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop an Environmental Impact
Statement for the interim storage facility, based on an environmental report submitted with the
license application.<br>
<li>The interim storage facility will be designed, licensed, constructed, and brought into 
operation using best commercial practices, and in accordance with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission regulation <em>Licensing Requirements for the Independent Storage of Spent Nuclear
Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste </em>(10 CFR Part 72) and other applicable regulations.
<li> An interim storage facility environmental report and license application will be submitted
to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2000.
<li> The Federal interim storage facility will begin receiving spent fuel deliveries from the
waste acceptance, storage, and transportation contractors in 2002.
</ul><p>
<h4>Key Planning Elements</h4>
<p>
<strong>Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation</strong><p>

<strong>Competitive procurement for waste acceptance, storage, and transportation services</strong><br>
The Program is contemplating carrying out its waste acceptance, storage, and transportation
functions using a market-driven approach that relies on competitive contracts with the private
sector for implementation. Under this initiative, contractors will perform their functions
consistent with the<em> Standard Contract (Article IV.B) </em>by accepting spent fuel at Purchasers’ sites
on behalf of the Department and delivering it to a Department facility. Contractors would be
compensated based on performance of these services and would accept financial risk. Contractors
will be encouraged to use innovative approaches to improve efficiency, to solve problems, to
overcome obstacles to performance, and to lower costs.
<p>
<em>Multiple Awards:</em> It is envisioned that this will be the first of several similar future procurements
covering waste acceptance, storage modules, and transportation services and equipment to be
provided over several decades. For the purpose of establishing and sustaining viable competition,
the Department is contemplating awarding multiple fixed-price type contracts. One approach
under consideration is to divide the country into regions. (For example, the four Nuclear
Regulatory Commission regions might be used.) Under this approach, one contractor would
provide waste acceptance and transportation services to all Purchasers in a given region for the
duration of the contract period. Selected contractors would be responsible to provide waste
acceptance and transportation services to all Purchasers with allocations in the Department's
<em>Acceptance Priority Ranking and Annual Capacity Report</em> within their respective service regions.
To preserve competition and encourage industrial capability within the market place, no single
offerer would be awarded more than a portion of the work.
<p>
<em>Scope of Services:</em> Contractors will be responsible to accept spent fuel on behalf of the
Department as identified in the <em>Acceptance Priority Ranking and the Annual Capacity Report </em>at
Purchasers' facilities and deliver it to a Federal facility (either a repository or an interim storage
facility). Contractors would be responsible to provide all transportation casks and equipment
suitable for use at Purchasers' sites, accept spent fuel for shipment as an agent of the
Department, and deliver the spent fuel and compatible storage systems to the Department facility.
Initially, spent fuel delivered to the facility would be canistered before arrival at the facility. At
some point in the service period, the facility license may be amended to allow handling of
uncanistered spent fuel, and the contractor may be required to transition to delivery of
uncanistered spent fuel.
<p>
Transportation and storage would be carried out using commercially available equipment in
compliance with applicable Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Department of Transportation 
regulations, Department of Energy acceptance criteria, and standard commercial practices.
Contractors would provide service in accordance with the <em>Acceptance Priority Ranking and
Annual Capacity Report;</em> however, contractors might, with Purchaser agreement and notification
to the Department, alter the order of acceptance to achieve efficiency of operation or to lower
costs. Contractors would also be responsible for any intermodal transport required, including
heavy haul, whether from the Purchasers' sites or to the Federal receiving facility.
<p>
<em>Schedule: </em>Schedule specifics would be addressed in the solicitation. For planning purposes, it is
expected that a Federal facility could be in operation to receive spent nuclear fuel within three
and one-half years of Congressional direction and contractors could be expected to begin
developing service arrangements with Purchasers two to three years before spent nuclear fuel
shipment.
<p>
<strong>Technical assistance and funding</strong>
<br>
Approximately three years before the start of waste acceptance and transportation operations, the
Program would begin providing technical assistance and funding for training public safety
officials in emergency response and safe transport procedures, as required under Section 180 
of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, as amended.<a href="./ch22.htm"><em> Section 2.2.2</em></a> provides an expanded discussion of
this requirement.
<p>
<strong>Interim Storage</strong><br>

The development of an interim storage facility would include environmental, design, licensing,
and construction activities. Development of the facility would be accelerated by licensing and
constructing the facility in two phases:
<p><ul>
<li><strong> Phase I</strong> operations would be limited to the acceptance of spent nuclear fuel in canisters
suitable for transportation and storage. Operations in this phase would not require the
construction of spent fuel-handling facilities, which would be deferred to Phase II.
<li><strong>Phase II</strong> operations would include acceptance of uncanistered spent nuclear fuel that
would be transferred from transportation casks to storage casks for storage on site at the interim
storage facility. 
</ul><p>
Following the designation of a site, the Program would perform a detailed site investigation and
develop an environmental report to be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as a part
of the Phase I license application. The environmental report would provide the basis for an
Environmental Impact Statement to be prepared by the Commission. Site-specific activities, 
including site-specific facility design and preparation of  the Phase I license application, would
begin following the enactment of legislation designating a site. These activities would draw on
the non-site specific work conducted under the first stage of the strategy before site designation.
The Program would also develop and issue request(s) for proposals for facility construction and
operation.
<p>
Following submission of the license application, the Program would complete final procurement
and construction design and award a contract or contracts for constructing and operating Phase I
of the facility.  Upon issuance of  an Environmental Impact Statement, a Record of Decision on
the Environmental Impact Statement, and an interim storage facility operating license by the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Phase I facility would begin accepting canistered spent fuel.
Spent fuel acceptance and interim storage facility operations are expected to commence
approximately four years after a site is designated.

<h6>A Phase I interim storage facility would have the capability to receive canistered spent nuclear fuel and to transfer the canistered spent fuel from transportation casks to storage casks for interim storage. The storage yard would consist of a concrete pad with appropriate security and monitoring systems. Temporary facilities would be provided for administrative activities.</h6>
<p>
Phase II development would proceed concurrently with Phase I development and operations, and
would follow the same general process, but would take about two years longer due to the
requirements of designing, licensing, and constructing a facility to handle uncanistered spent
nuclear fuel. Under the assumed timetable, the Phase II license application would be submitted to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission an estimated six months before the Phase I license is
granted. Transportation and receipt of uncanistered spent nuclear fuel would commence when the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues the Phase II license. <a href="./fig13.jpg"><em>Figures 13</em> </a>(on the preceding page)
and<a href="fig14.gif"> <em>14</em></a> (on this page) present a preliminary concept of Phase I and Phase II interim storage
facilities.

</pre><br>
<h6>A Phase II interim storage facility would include fuel transfer facilities capable of handling uncanistered spent fuel at a receipt rate of up to 3,000 metric tons of uranium (MTU) per year. Phase II of the interim storage facility would be constructed as an adjunct to the Phase I facility, incorporating modular construction techniques to the maximum extent practical. Storage would be in individual concrete storage casks on a concrete pad. Phase II would also include a facility for handling any waste generated on the site, a centralized control room, and a vehicle maintenance facility. In Phase II, temporary facilities and trailers constructed in Phase I would be replaced with permanent facilities.</h6>
