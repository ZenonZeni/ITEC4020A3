<h2>Potential Impacts</h2>
<P>Energy-efficient purchasing at
the Federal level in the U.S. is expected to contribute significantly to
the overall goal of saving at least $1 billion/year out of the $4
billion spent annually for energy in U.S. government facilities.  This
energy savings also implies a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions of
up to 12 million metric tons of CO2. The effect of encouraging other
large buyers to use the same efficiency criteria, can be several times
as large.  But even more important may be the indirect impact in
mobilizing the entire market for such products--by creating expectations
among manufacturers and sellers that their largest customers are going
to continue to demand more efficient products, and making efficiency a
marketable feature through product labels and listings.  The key to
market transformation is creating this self-fulfilling "race to the
top."</P>
