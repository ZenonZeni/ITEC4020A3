<H3>Grazing </H3>
<HR>

<P>
The assessment of landcover disturbance for the ELZ was based
entirely on expert interpretation of the satellite image data.
As such, it was far more subjective and far less quantitative
in its result than the assessment for clearing.
<P>
Accepting these limitations, what were the findings for this type
of landcover within the ELZ?
<P>
This question is answered in three parts: how much?; where?; and
which landcover type was most affected?<HR>

<H4>Aggregate Area </H4>

<P>
The relative distribution of disturbance classes across all landcover
types aggregated indicates the largest area of the ELZ (62%) to
be only slightly or not disturbed, approximately 15% to be substantially
disturbed, and some 26% to be significantly disturbed. The latter
class was allocated only to landcover types within tenure types
1 (Freehold) and 2 (Pastoral). This was not an entirely surprising
result given the large proportion of the ELZ that is subject to
little or no grazing landuse.<HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="table8"></A>Table 8</B>: The distribution of the area
of the ELZ among the four landcover disturbance classes. Where
no valid interpretation could be made, the indeterminate class
was assigned.

<P>
Translating these figures from just the ELZ to the entire continent
we have: 37% was slightly or not disturbed, 9% was substantially
disturbed, and 15% was significantly disturbed.
<P>
The area of significantly disturbed landcover was approximately
the same as the area cleared (See Table 5).
<P>
In terms of the management of biotic erosion, the figures are
not as daunting as those for clearing because clearing represents
a far more severe and permanent impact than do the landcover impacts
of grazing<HR>

class was allocated where no valid assessment could be made.</I>

<P>
<I>These patterns are the result of the interaction of irregular
landcover boundaries with the geometric tenure boundaries. Recall
that the assessment of landcover disturbance was based on landcover
type within tenure types.</I><HR>

<P>
These differences in condition reflect both their relative distribution
within tenure types, and their resilience under grazing.
<P>
Most landcover types were only slightly disturbed. The significantly
disturbed landcover types were the open grasslands (xG2), and
the open and sparse Acacia forests and shrublands. The disturbance
status of many of these landcover types is presented in greater
detail in <A HREF="content5.htm">Case Studies</A>.<HR>
