<h4><a name="the">THE MEDICAL MONOPOLY</a></h4><p>

<b>Your Tax Dollars Limit the Competition</b><br>
	Medical licensing laws and federal reimbursement programs severely limit open competition among medical modalities and keep the cost of American health care exorbitant, states medical analyst Sue Blevins, R.N., M.P.H., an adjunct scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., in a new policy analysis from the Cato Institute of Washington, D.C. <p>
	Ever since their introduction in the 1870s, licensing laws have limited the supply of health care providers, thereby limiting competition and increasing doctors’ incomes, Blevins explains. Government policies, which strongly favor (and reward) conventional medicine, are largely responsible for the escalation of health care costs and the lack of a wide range of choices in medical services. In addition, there is “little actual evidence that medical licensing improves quality [of care] or protects the public,” says Blevins. The result is a “government-imposed medical monopoly,” supported by the tax dollars of all Americans, including the 33% who consult alternative practitioners.<p>
	Consider how licensing regulations restrict the public’s access to nonphysician health care providers, such as midwives. There are 10,000 midwives in the U.S., but 36 states either restrict or prohibit their activities. “American’s low usage of midwifery does not correlate with high-quality birth outcomes,” Blevins says, because the U.S. has the world’s second highest rate of Cesarean sections and has the fifth highest infant mortality rate among industrialized nations. Midwife-assisted births could save Americans $2.4 billion annually if only 20% of women used them.<p>
	Nurse practitioners are another case in point. These are registered nurses (R.N.s) with advanced training. Research indicates that almost 80% of adult primary care and about 90% of child care services could be safely provided by nurse practitioners. A 1993 Gallup poll reported that 86% of consumers would willingly use nurse practitioners for all their basic medical services. <p>
	Further, we could be saving between $6.4 and $8.75 billion a year if nurse practitioners were more widely used. But they’re not because “many states impose scope-of-practice regulations that prevent nurses from practicing independently as primary care providers,” says Blevins. This action suppresses the full potential demand for them because they are not legally free to compete.<p>
	Whether you like it or not, your tax dollars directly subsidize conventional medical schools, but not alternative schools such as chiropractic or naturopathic colleges, says Blevins. Today only 5% of medical school income comes from tuition and fees; the rest comes from state and federal government subsidies. Of the $23 billion U.S. medical schools received in 1992, $2.7 billion came from state and local governments, and $10.3 billion came from the federal government. <p>
	Your tax dollars support the medical monopoly through other means, too, such as research, training, and teaching grants from agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, which cover only conventional medicine, Blevins says. <p>
	The time for reform is at hand, urges Blevins. Even if you do not particularly favor alternative medicine, she argues, the medical monopoly goes against the capitalist grain of free, unrestricted, nonmonopolistic competition in the marketplace.  We haven’t seen that for over 125 years when it comes to medicine in this country. “Breaking the anti-competitive barriers of licensing laws and federal reimbursement regulations will provide meaningful health reform, increase consumer choice, and reduce health care costs,” states Blevins.<p>

<h4><a name="health">HEALTH INSURANCE HYPOCRISY</a></h4><p>

<b>Smoking Both Ends</b><br>
	In case you think major U.S. insurance companies actively discourage cigarette smoking, now conclusively linked with health deterioration, the fact that many of the largest health insurers are prime stockholders in tobacco companies should change your mind with a jolt. <p>
	Prudential, the country’s largest health insurer and largest owner of for-profit HMOs, owns big shares (a total of 245 million) in 5 of the 6 largest tobacco companies. Traveler’s Insurance Company holds at least 88 million total shares in 2 companies; Met-Life, before it merged with Traveler’s, held 15 million; and Signa held 75 million shares in 2 tobacco companies. Industry analysts explain this extreme hypocrisy as a “win-win strategy” because even though every day about 1000 smokers die of tobacco poisoning, another 1000 recruits are signed up as new smokers. <p>
	As the U.S. moves toward being the world’s first corporate-run for- profit health care system, the market seems to demand that allegiance to profit take precedence over concern for health. The major insurers collect higher premiums from smokers while profiting from their destructive smoking habits in higher tobacco sales as well.<p>

<h4><a name="gulf">GULF WAR SYNDROME</a></h4><p>

<b>Thanks to Biological Germ Warfare</b><br>
	Research evidence is accumulating to suggest that Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) may be the result of genetically engineered germ warfare. That’s the view according to Garth Nicolson, Ph.D., professor of pathology and internal medicine, chairman of the tumor biology department at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas (the largest such facility in the world), and author of 400 scientific papers. <p>
	Dr. Nicolson argues that the GWS microbe seems to be the product of combining a gene from the HIV-AIDS virus with a mycoplasma (a tiny cellular component, normally harmless, until activated) to produce a new super pathogenic and infectious microbe not otherwise found in nature. The genetic engineering was presumably conducted in a secret lab, probably in the U.S., Nicolson says, then sold (with at least 10 other biological warfare agents) to the Iraqi government between 1984 and 1989. <p>
	While the U.S. government denies GWS as a legitimate illness category, as many as 6000 U.S. soldiers have already died from this otherwise mysterious illness, at least 15,000 more are sick from it, family members never in the Gulf are becoming infected, and miscarriages and congenitally deformed children are attributed to it as well, says Dr. Nicolson. <p>
	Further, GWS symptoms are strikingly similar to chronic fatigue on 31 points, with the highest correlation (85%) being aching joints. Dr. Nicolson hints that the biological-warfare-derived microbe may be central to both illnesses. Meanwhile, Dr. Nicolson has published information on his successful antibiotic treatment (tetracycline at 100 mg, 2 times daily for 10 days, although up to 6 courses may be required) for GWS. <p>
	Dr. Nicolson also contends, based on private sources, that the GWS HIV-mycoplasma microbe may have been tested on the prison inmate population in Texas. “We have possibly uncovered one of the messiest controversies and cover-ups since Watergate,”  Dr. Nicolson states. “There is a huge cover-up of immense proportions. A lot of people are not happy about this getting out.<p>

<h4><a name="meat">MEAT-EATING’S $60 BILLION PRICE TAG</a></h4><p>

	A new report released by the Physicians’ Committee for Responsible Medicine, a vegetarian advocacy group in Washington, D.C., calculated the medical costs of meat consumption according to health problem. The assumption in their calculations is that high levels of meat consumption have been proven to be linked to the development of serious medical conditions. <p>
	In terms of treatment costs, doctors’ fees, drugs, and hospitalizations, hypertension costs up to $8.5 billion; heart disease, $9.5 billion; cancer, $16.5 billion; diabetes, $17.1 billion; gallbladder disease, $2.4 billion; obesity-related musculoskeletal problems, $1.9 billion; and food-borne illness, $5.5 billion. <p>
	In other words, the price tag for American-style meat-eating accounts for as much as $61.4 billion in direct health care costs each year. “It is time to stop scratching our heads about the nation’s exploding health care costs,” the report stated. “We can cut those costs by eliminating subsidies for livestock feed and dairy products, and scrapping out-of-date diet guidelines that encourage traditional, meat-based diets.<p>

<h4><a name="the2">THE DEMAND FOR ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IS 39% HIGHER THAN THE SUPPLY</a></h4><p>

	In July 1995, the Seattle-King County Department of Health in Washington State surveyed 759 patients to assess their use of alternative medicine. Of those polled, 77% were women, 26% were Asian, 67% were aged 20-49, and 35% had no health insurance. The study showed that 19% had used some form of alternative medicine in the past year and 58% would use such treatments if they were “affordable and convenient.<p>
	Of those polled, 13% said they had at some time consulted an acupuncturist, 33% a chiropractor, 24% a massage therapist, 18% a naturopath, while 44% said they had used some form of alternative medicine at least once. The difference  between the number of one-time users (19%) and possible future  users (58%, if “affordable and convenient”) indicates a “potential unmet demand” of 39% of patients for alternative medicine. <p>

<h4><a name="nci">NCI IGNORES THE FACTS</a></h4><p>

<b>Government Agency Misinforms the Public</b><br>
	In their official handout for public inquiries regarding the Gerson Therapy for cancer, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a division of the U.S. Public Health Service, brazenly misinforms the public. Dr. Gerson’s methods were reviewed on a number of occasions; in no case was any evidence of effectiveness against cancer observed, NCI states. As a result, the Gerson method, which prescribes high amounts of carrot and apple juice, a vegetarian diet, and coffee enemas, is not considered to be an effective means of cancer treatment and no further evaluation is necessary.<p>
	However, if NCI were to keep up with new medical developments, they would realize how out of touch they have become with true clinical efficacy. A recent retrospective British study of the 5-year survival rates of 153 melanoma patients treated with the Gerson method instead of surgery, shows a high degree of success.<p>
	Patients with localized melanoma (stage I and II skin cancer) had a 100% survival rate with Gerson compared to 79% for conventional treatment. For patients with “regional spread melanoma” (stage III), the Gerson survival rate was 71% compared to 39%; and for “superficial distant spread” (stage IVA), Gerson scored 39% compared to 6% for orthodox methods. Lord Baldwin, Joint Chairman of the Parliamentary Group for Alternative and Complementary Medicine in London, England, urged the NCI to take up the challenge of this evidence “and give alternative therapies a proper trial.<p>
