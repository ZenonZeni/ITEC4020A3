<P>
As the manufacturing capital of Australia, Melbourne has all the
factor inputs and the infrastructure required by a manufacturing
investor.
<p>Melbourne is a low cost city for industrial factory and warehouse
rental and building construction. Industrial land is readily available
and very competitively priced.
<p>Much of the industrial land and property which is available for
sale
or lease in Melbourne is very well located in relation to the
major
transport systems - the Port of Melbourne, the airport and the
major highways and railways as well as being readily accessible
by
the workforce.
<p>Appropriately zoned and serviced freehold land is also available
in
block sizes which allow ample room for operational expansion.
Industrial land costs are lower in many cases, substantially lower-
in Melbourne than in virtually all other cities benchmarked by
KPMG.
<p><i>Melbourne's industrial land costs are less than half those in
Bangkok, 72% lower than Sydney, and 89% lower than Hong Kong.
Singapore is 123 times more expensive than Melbourne.
