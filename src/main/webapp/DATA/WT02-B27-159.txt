Welcome. If, one day, you become terminally or unrelievably ill (and you don't happen to be a Dutch citizen)
you may have little choice about the timing of your death. A large proportion of suicide attempts are botched, resulting
in increased suffering and indignity. Scottish Exit was the first organisation in the world, in 1980, to publish a book
on how to avoid botch-ups. There have been many imitators, but it was only in 1993 that such information was put on a scientific footing with
the international publication of <cite>Departing Drugs</cite>. The information is <cite>restricted</cite>. You must be over 21
and able to prove you are an established member of a right to die society.<FONT SIZE=4></strong>
