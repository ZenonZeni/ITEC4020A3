system (DIAMS) for air-land battle operation supports the tactical level. The
system includes : an intelligence processing and photo-interpretation module
(DEIMOS), a multi-sensor intelligence fusion system (AXIS), a planning and
tasking module (PEGASUS) forces and resources management module (SGFM) a
tactical situation display (VISU tactique)<p>
<p>
 Combat/execution level : Illustrated by a segment dedicated to image
acquisition and first level processing into a SAFARI dedicated system. The
resulting intelligence data (IMINT) are transmitted to the tactical level and
the operational level where they are fused and integrated into a SAFARI
component.<p>
<p>
 Surveillance Systems : Based on the Border Master 2000 on area surveillance
system performing intelligence data acquisition from multipurpose battlefield
radar RATAC-S and providing decision support tools.<p>

Jnl Electronics Ind 9/92 : Startek Engineering will market a Fingerprint
recognition control system which has wide applications. The FIC2000-I is a half
automated system in the monitoring and engineering areas. Expanded security
applications also include military uses.  Startek will also be introducing
security related computer IC cards.<p>
<p>
 Dr Wen-Hsing Hsu, designer of the fingerprint system, says that sales of the
fingerprint recognition market is growing at a double rate and estimates that
the world market for them is between 6000- 10,000 sets per year.<p>

 Int'l Fire &amp; Security Product 9/94 : Startek Fingerprint verifier makes
use of the unique and unchangeable characteristics of personal fingerprints.
The whole verification process takes just 3 seconds. The features of each live
scan fingerprint are extracted into a miniature file for matching. By reducing
this file to only 256 bytes, database requirements are significantly reduced
and the fingerprint template can easily be stored on card systems (smart cards,
optical cards etc).<p>

<p>
<b>Additional Information :</b><p>
<p>
Age 14/9/95 : A new command and control system being supplied to Victoria
Police, Australia. By 2001, each police car is expected to have a portable
personal computer. The PC will link up with the $160 million computer generated
call-taking and dispatch system being tested by Intergraph. Using satellite
technology every police car in Melbourne will be tracked along screens staffed
by civilians.  The computers will help operators decide which patrol cars to
send to incidents. Thanks to a giant computer driven map of the city being
compiled by Intergraph, the operators will be able to tell police all the
relevant details about the address they visit. Officers will know immediately
whether, for example, the owner is known to the police or if weapons are
inside. Eventually it may provide plans of the house in case of sieges.<p>
<p>
 Times 20/9/91 : Command and Control systems developed by Intergraph (US). The
most sophisticated police computer installed in Britain, that should play an
important role in tackling inner-city riots was unveiled by the Cleveland
police force. The heart of the computer is a geographic information system
which, when an incident is restored, can instantly display a map showing
streets, buildings and incident's location. The map also shows the locations of
police vehicles and officers. Plans to link police vehicles to the system,
providing more secure communications than radio and also plans to introduce a
facility for tracing telephone calls. The system, developed by Intergraph and
supplied to US Forces, is able to turn two dimensional plans of buildings into
three dimensional drawings.<p>
<p>
 IPEC 91 : Dispatch management system (DMS) "the most advanced command &amp;
control system of its kind in the world" - chosen by Cleveland Constabulary.
DMS integrates dynamic mapping into the dispatching process + relational
database, also video frame grabber &amp; geographic information system (GIS).<p>

CCTV Vol 1.3 : Contract to supply Spain's Basque Police with system for the
transmission of data between mobile policing situations.<p>
<p>
<b>Additional Information :</b><p>
<p>
CCTV Vol 1.3 : TV2 Ltd supplies a range of broadcast facilities and equipment.
Announced a contract to supply Basque Police. Aerlyper SA (Madrid, Spain) leads
the contract. The system is to provide transmission of data between mobile
police situation, in particular sending live video and thermal pictures
integrated with GPS data between the ground, aircraft and control centres.  TV2
is supplying a range of wireless camera systems, microwave and communications
equipment as well as a Global Autotracker intelligent antenna system. The
Global Autotracker sends pictures from a police helicopter approx three times
further than conventional microwave antenna systems, so extending the practical
range of operation. It also offers police the capacity to send on the same
signal a range of data such as time, date and grid reference, thus reducing the
need for radio talk. Because it is highly directional, it has a high degree of
built-in security from unauthorised interception.<p>
<p>
 Copex 94 : Live microwave transmission for security and surveillance. In
addition to consultancy and systems interrogation, TV2 offers a range of
intelligent, steerable antenna systems, called Global Autotracker, for live
transmission over distances up to 140Km. Already in use with UK and European
police forces, the Global Autotracker has also been commissioned by Defence
Ministries.<p>
