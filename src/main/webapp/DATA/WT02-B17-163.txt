<H3>Introduction</H3>
Currently, there are approximately 8.5 GW of grid-connected biomass electrical
generating capacity in the U.S., including that from landfill
gas and municipal solid waste (see <A HREF="#fig1">Figure 1</A>).  Unfortunately,
a substantial fraction of this existing capacity employs relatively
unsophisticated and inefficient direct steam technology.  Average
efficiencies for existing systems are less than 25%.  As a consequence,
the size of a given biomass power installation historically has
been limited by these low efficiencies and the amount of fuel
within an economical transportation radius.  The resulting low
output yields a high capital cost for these systems on a dollars
per kilowatt basis ($/kW).  A number of recent developments are
changing the nature and constraints of the biomass power option,
however.
<P>
Significant technical advancements are being made that
will allow for substantially increased utilization efficiency
of biomass as a fuel.  Advanced gas turbine and combined cycle
technology is being commercially deployed and demonstrated with
natural gas as well as solid fuels such as coal through the use
of gasification technology.  Biomass gasification technologies
are also being developed and demonstrated.  Linking these conversion
and utilization processes will nearly double current biomass electrical
generation efficiencies.  Concurrently, DOE, NREL, and ORNL are
actively pursuing development and demonstration of Dedicated Feedstock
Supply Systems (DFSS).  Such systems would allow operation of
plants requiring as much as 2000 dry T/day of biomass feed.  The
combination of advancing technology and improved fuel supply will
increase the feasible biomass power plant size into a range attractive
to utilities, and thus expand the market for biomass power beyond
the independent power producers and co-generators who have, to
date, been the principal players in the biomass power industry.
<P>
Moreover, these biomass power systems will further leverage research
dollars by directly and substantially benefitting from the technological
advances being made by government and industry funded gas turbine
and fuel cell development programs.  These utilization technologies
are the subject of substantial development efforts, and are being
demonstrated in integrated systems with coal gasifiers under the
Clean Coal Technology Program.

<H4>Purpose of Study</H4>
The purpose of this study was
to determine the efficiency and cost of electricity of IGCC systems
incorporating biomass gasification technology.  The systems we
examined incorporate state-of-the-art, commercially available
aero-derivative and utility gas turbine technology as well as
scale-appropriate modern steam cycle technology.  The resulting
performance and cost numbers indicate the commercial potential
for these systems, and define areas for continued and focused
research.  We also examined different options for gas cleaning
prior to combustion in the gas turbine combustor, and compared
our results to previous studies on this subject.
<H4>Systems Studied</H4>
ASPEN simulations were performed on three biomass IGCC systems: an air-blown
(i.e. direct-fired) pressurized fluidized bed gasifier of the
type under development by the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT),
the Battelle Columbus Laboratory (BCL) low pressure indirectly-heated
biomass gasifier, and an air-blown low pressure gasifier similar
to that developed by Thermiska Processor AB (TPS) in cooperation
with ABB-Flakt.  Process development unit (PDU) experimental results,
where available, provided the basis for gasifier performance predictions.
A high degree of process integration between the gasifier and
combined cycle was incorporated to maximize system efficiency.
 The combined cycles investigated were based on aero-derivative
and state-of-the-art utility gas turbines of appropriate sizes.
 To make a direct comparison of different combined cycle systems,
the high pressure direct-fired gasifier was integrated with both
an aero-derivative gas turbine and an utility gas turbine.  The
aero-derivative gas turbine selected for this study was the General
Electric LM5000PC.  This unit has a higher pressure ratio (24.8)
and firing temperature (in excess of 1150&#176;C) than the utility
machines selected for most previous biomass IGCC studies.  The
utility-scale gas turbine selected was the GE MS-6101FA, an advanced
turbine that moves GE's "F" technology (high firing
temperature, high efficiency) down to a 70 MW-class machine.
<P> 
Because of lower overall system efficiencies (as compared with
the utility turbine case) and higher fuel pressures required,
cases integrating the low pressure gasifiers with the LM5000 turbine
were not considered.  All systems employing the utility turbine
used a two-pressure reheat steam cycle.  The LM5000 case used
a small, non-reheat steam cycle.  Gas cleanup in all cases included
a tar cracker to reduce the quantity of higher hydrocarbon species
in the gas, followed by gas cooling via direct or indirect quench
to condense alkali species.  For the high pressure gasifier, a
hot ceramic candle filter of the type being offered by Westinghouse
and being demonstrated under the Clean Coal Technology Program
was used to remove particulate matter including these condensed
alkali compounds.  In this case, the quench step cooled the gas
down to less than 538&#176;C.  Particulate removal in the low-pressure
gasifier cases was accomplished with cyclones and a fabric filter.
 The direct quench that follows in these latter cases reduces
the fuel gas temperature to 96&#176;C in preparation for compression.
<P>
Other alternate designs that were studied include greenfield plant construction
instead of an existing plant site basis, indirect cooling of the
synthesis gas, various levels of humidification of the syngas,
and different moisture levels of the feedstock.  It should be
noted that not all of these variations were examined with each
gasifier combined cycle system.  Performance, cost, and economic
data were developed for each of the cases tested, and are presented
in this report.
<H3>Methodology</H3>
The intent
of this study was to evaluate the ultimate potential for application
of IGCC technology to biomass-based power systems of large scale
(&gt; 30 MWE).  Therefore, the plant designs examined were assumed
to be for mature, "n<SUP>th</SUP>-plant" systems.  The aggressive
sparing and redundancies typically utilized for "first-plant"
designs and the attendant cost associated with such an approach
were not applied to the systems examined here.  However, the technology
and equipment utilized in all of the system designs is currently,
though not in all cases commercially, available.  In some cases,
the technology selected for these systems is under development
for increased reliability, availability, and maintainability.
 However, projected technological advances that may result from
on-going research were not included or assumed.
<P>
The base year of
1990 was chosen for cost and economic analyses in this study.
 In part, this reference year was chosen to facilitate comparison
of our costs with previous studies in this area.
<H4>Process Analysis</H4>
Detailed
process models were developed using the Advanced System for Process
ENgineering (ASPEN/SP) process simulator to evaluate the performance
of the three biomass IGCC systems.  The material and energy balance
results of these simulations were used to size and cost major
pieces of equipment from which the resulting cost of electricity
was calculated.  As part of this development, data from PDU operation
of the IGT and BCL gasifiers were regressed and incorporated into
a user-specified yield reactor.  Detailed information on gasifier
operation and performance at a variety of conditions was not available
for the low-pressure direct gasifier.  Therefore, this case utilized
a quasi-equilibrium model and reactant ratios developed from limited
data contained in a Lurgi report on fluidized bed gasification
of biomass<A HREF="#1">[1]</A>.
<P>
Gas turbine performance when utilizing low
energy content biomass derived fuel gas was estimated based on
the operating parameters (air flow, pressure ratio, firing temperature,
outlet temperature) of the selected gas turbine<A HREF="#2">[2]</A>, <A HREF="#3">[3]</A>.
 A simulation was developed that matches its performance (output,
heat rate) on natural gas fuel by "tuning" the efficiency
of the various compression and expansion stages as well adjusting
heat losses, cooling air extraction  etc.  Utilizing these same
"tuning" parameters, the resulting turbine model was
incorporated, along with the biomass gasifier and cleanup section
models, into an overall gasification combined cycle simulation.
 The simulation was configured such that the amount of biomass
fed to the system was calculated based on the amount of gaseous
fuel required by the gas turbine to achieve its design firing
temperature.  Changes in the gas turbine output and efficiency
because of the increased mass flow of the low energy content gas
and the higher fuel gas temperature are thus roughly predicted.
 This approach has been employed in numerous studies performed
at the Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) for coal-based
IGCC systems.  This prediction method has also been validated,
within certain limits, by results obtained by turbine manufacturers
and engineering firms that have prepared detailed designs of the
such systems.  It must be realized, especially in the air-blown
gasifier cases, that modification of the gas turbine combustor
may be required in order to efficiently combust the low calorific
value fuel gas produced.  The design limits of the turbine compressor
must also be kept in mind when mass flow through the turbine section
is increased.  Such a scenario arises, again, due to the reduced
(compared to natural gas) chemical energy content of the fuel
gas produced from biomass.
<P>
The simulation calculates the overall
biomass-to-electricity efficiency for the system based on total
feed to the system and the net electrical power produced.  The
major auxiliary equipment items (feed water pumps, boost compressor,
blowers, etc.) are explicitly included in the simulation, and
their power requirements subtracted from the gross plant output.
 A 3% charge was taken against this preliminary net power (gross
minus major equipment) to account for balance of plant electrical
power including wood handling and drying.
<H4>Site Conditions</H4>
Since this was not a site specific design, ranges of ambient conditions
were not available.  Therefore, International Standards Organization
(ISO) conditions (15&#176;C, 1 bar atmospheric pressure, 60%
relative humidity) were assumed as the ambient conditions for
this evaluation.  Air fed to the plant was assumed to be composed
of 20.73 mol% oxygen, 78.22 mol% nitrogen, 1.02 mol% water, and
0.03 mol% carbon dioxide.
<H4>Wood Analysis</H4>
The biomass used in each analysis was that used most extensively
in testing each gasifier.  Wisconsin maple wood chips have been
tested at a number of gasifier conditions in the IGT RENUGAS&#174;
9 T/day process development unit (PDU), and are therefore used
in the high pressure simulations.  According to tests at BCL,
the biomass used for the low pressure indirectly-heated gasifier
simulation is typical of woody biomass such as hybrid poplar.
 Wisconsin maple was also used as the feedstock in the low pressure
direct gasifier simulation.  The ability to feed biomass to gasification
systems, high and low pressure, has been demonstrated in experimental
work at a variety of scales.  Detailed analyses of the feedstock,
product gas, and solid residues are available from experimental
data for the IGT and BCL gasifiers.  For the low-pressure direct
gasifier case, feed data is available and char and product gas
composition is estimated.  In the ASPEN simulations, biomass and
char were simulated as non-conventional components; the elemental
and property analysis for each biomass type are shown in <A HREF="#table1">Table
1</A>.  The heat of combustion was calculated by adjusting the standard
ASTM correlation for biomass.

<H4>General Plant Requirements</H4>
With the exception of the greenfield analysis of the high pressure
direct gasifier, the plants examined are assumed to be located
at or near an existing generating facility and to share facilities
such as land and an electrical  substation.  Additionally, all
plants are assumed to be in close proximity to roads or railroad
spurs adequate for delivery of the biomass feedstock.  This is
likely to be true when a dedicated feedstock supply system (DFSS)
is employed since the power plant would be sited near the center
of the agricultural area representing its biomass "shed".
 In addition to the major process areas and equipment discussed
later in the report, the following items and systems are assumed
to be part of the plants evaluated in this study:  cooling water
systems, plant and instrument air, potable and utility water,
effluent water treatment, flare system, fire-water system, interconnecting
piping, buildings, lighting, computer control system, and electrical
system.

<P>
All systems simulated incorporate
a fairly high level of integration between plant sections.  In
each system examined, a char combustor is used to convert any
un-gasified carbon.  The resulting energy provides pre-heating
for the gasifier steam and air (where required), as well as heat
for the biomass drying.  In actual practice, carbon conversion
in the direct gasifiers may be sufficiently high that a separate
char combustor is not required.  In the indirectly-heated gasification
system, the char is combusted to heat sand which is circulated
to the gasifier.  There, the hot sand provides heat for the endothermic
gasification reactions.
<P>
Air for the direct-fired gasifiers was
removed from the gas turbine compressor discharge scroll and boosted
or let down in pressure, as appropriate, with a compressor or
turbine.  This air extraction is necessary to avoid significantly
increased mass flow in the expansion section of the gas turbine,
and thus compressor surge.  Without air extraction, turbine mass
flow would be increased due to high fuel gas flows necessitated
by the fuel gas's low energy content.  Gasification steam, where
required, was extracted from an appropriate location in the steam
cycle.
<P>
For the aero-derivative turbine (LM5000) cases, a single
train for all process sections and units was used.  The "small"
utility turbine (MS-6101FA) case required use of two gasification
trains to provide adequate fuel gas.  This also imparts some part-load
redundancy in these systems.  Each plant section is discussed
further below.
<H4>Wood Preparation and Drying</H4>
Design of the wood receiving, handling, and drying operations was based
on a number of existing studies in this area <A HREF="#4">[4]</A>, <A HREF="#5">[5]</A>, <A HREF="#6">[6]</A>.  Wood chips sized to 0 x 2" are delivered by truck to the
plant site at a cost of $46/bone dry Tonne ($42/bone dry ton).
The feed requirements for each plant are shown in <A HREF="#table2">Table 2</A>.  The
wood was unloaded and moved to the paved storage yard that was
sized to provide one week of feed storage.  Wood reclaimed from
the storage yard was sized to less than 1&#189;" and conveyed
to the wet feed storage silo (one day of storage).  Wood from
the silo was conveyed from the silo to the dryers (2 in parallel)
and then to the "live" or "day" storage tank
from which it is fed to the gasifier.

<P>
The wood dryers are of the co-current rotary drum type.  Design
conditions selected for the wood drying section result in a moisture
content of 11% by weight (17% in the low-pressure direct case
for reasons that will be explained later).  In the direct-fired
gasifier plants, the gas used for wood drying was a mixture of
combustion products from a small fluidized bed combustor flue
gas extracted from the HRSG.  For the indirectly-heated gasifier,
a mixture of ambient air and char combustor flue gas is used.
 For each design, sufficient ambient air is mixed with the combustion
products to reduce the gas temperature to 204&#176;C (400&#176;F)
prior to introduction to the dryers.  While this can result in
a relatively high oxygen content (16 mole %), the temperature
is believed to be sufficiently low to avoid the possibility of
dryer fires.  Gas leaving the dryers at a temperature of 80&#176;C
(175&#176;F) enters the dryer cyclone and then a baghouse to reduce
particulate emissions. The temperature level at the baghouse is,
again, believed to be sufficiently low to mitigate fire danger.
 The dried wood exits the dryers at 68&#176;C (155&#176;F) and
cools further during final transport to the feed system.
<H3>High Pressure, Air-Blown Gasification</H3>
The high pressure gasifier system selected for this study was a fluidized
bed unit similar to that under development by the Institute of
Gas Technology (IGT) and marketed under the name RENUGAS&#174;.
A schematic of this gasifier integrated with the combined cycle
plant is shown in <A HREF="#fig2">Figure 2</A>.  This is a pressurized, air-blown,
single stage fluidized bed gasifier.  The gasifier bed material
is typically an inert solid such as alumina.  The bed material
improves fluidization quality and increases bed depth and heat
capacity, solid residence time, and carbon conversion.  The IGT
gasifier has been operated over a wide range of temperature, pressure,
oxidant, and fuel types at the process development (PDU) scale,
and is the subject of a larger scale demonstration projects in
the United States (Hawaii) and Europe (Finland).  
<P>
Wood from the feed lockhopper is introduced into the pressurized
feed hopper with live-bottom metering screws to meter the feed
into an injection screw that introduces the feed into the gasifier
near the bottom of the bed.  Air and a small amount of steam are
introduced to effect the gasification and combustion reactions.
 The operating temperature selected for the gasifier for this
study was 830&#176;C (1526&#176;F).  The gasifier operating
pressure for aero-derivative turbine case was 3.24 MPa (32 atm)
and 2.07 MPa (20 atm) for the utility gas turbine system.  The
former pressure is outside the currently demonstrated range for
this gasifier which is 23 atm, but is believed to be achievable
due to experience with coal gasifier designs operated at similar
pressures.  These pressures take into account the pressure drop
through the gas cleaning systems and allow for a 25% pressure
drop across the gas turbine fuel control valve.  Gasifier design
and operating conditions are contained in <A HREF="#table3">Table 3</A>.  Composition
of the gasifier product gas was based on experimental data from
the IGT PDU gasifier tests with maple wood chips.  Continued development
by IGT has lead to improved gas quality and increased carbon conversion
since these data were obtained.  It is expected that the commercial
design for this gasification technology would realize these benefits
as well.  The product gas composition used in this study is contained
in <A HREF="#table4">Table 4</A>.  Product gas from the gasifier enters the primary
cyclone which removes char and ash particles prior to entering
the tar cracking unit.

Direct quenching produces a fuel gas with
a lower heating value (LHV) of  4.3 MJ/m3 (115 Btu/standard cubic
foot).  Indirect quench produces a fuel gas of slightly higher
quality 4.8 MJ/m3 (128 Btu/standard cubic foot).  Analysis indicates
that indirect quenching is relatively cost neutral so could be
used in cases where gas quality is important.

<H4>Gasifier Design</H4>
General gasifier size determination was based on information
from the IGT 9 T/day PDU as well as the design for the scaled-up,
91 T/day unit operating at the Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar Company
(HC&S) sugarmill at Paia, Maui, by the Pacific International
Center for High Technology Research (PICHTR).  Additional demonstrations
of this technology include a 64 T/day unit in Finland.  The solid
throughput, gas superficial velocity, and the ratio of bed to
disengaging zone cross-sectional area were all maintained at the
same level as for the 91 T/day demonstration unit.  This yielded
a gasifier vessel with a bed diameter of 2.86 meters (9.4 feet)
between the  refractory lined walls and a vessel outside diameter
of 4.26 meters (14 feet).
<H4>Gas Clean-up</H4>
For this case, gas cleanup was accomplished by cooling the product
gas to less than 538&#176;C (1000&#176;F) via direct quench
to condense alkali species.  A hot ceramic candle filter of the
type being offered by Westinghouse and being demonstrated in the
Clean Coal Technology Program is then used for removal of particulate
matter including, it is hoped, the condensed alkali compounds.
 Recent tests of tar cracking and this particulate and alkali
removal strategy were conducted at the IGT PDU unit in Chicago.
 Results from these tests indicate that a tar cracker may not
be necessary in an eventual commercial system design.  The tars
are produced in fairly small quantities, and appear to be substantially
cracked prior to reaching the tar cracking vessel.  The particulate
filters tested at IGT also did not experience any plugging problems
due to tars, and were successful in reducing the particulate matter
and alkali species in the gas stream to very low levels.  Long-term
testing of the filters will be conducted in the coming year at
the PICHTR facility.  For the purposes of this study, therefore
quenching followed by the ceramic candle filters was assumed to
be sufficient for fuel gas cleaning.
<H4>High Temperature Gas Cooling</H4>
Alkali species present in the fuel gas can cause corrosion and deposition if introduced
into the expansion section of a gas turbine.  Therefore, it was
necessary to remove these species prior to combustion.  These
must be removed to extremely low levels, typically less than one
part per million. Fortunately, most alkali components present
in biomass synthesis gas have relatively high condensation temperatures.
 Therefore, cooling to below 538&#176;C (1000&#176;F) results
in condensation of the bulk of these species, usually as fine
particles that can be removed with the rest of the particulates.
 This cooling can be accomplished in a number of ways.  The base
case analyzed here performs this cooling by direct injection of
water into the gas stream.  While this dilutes the fuel gas stream
and reduces its heating value, it was the simplest and least expensive
from an equipment standpoint.  An alternate case utilized indirect
cooling of the fuel gas, utilizing the recovered heat in the steam
cycle.
<H4>High Temperature Particulate Removal</H4>
Westinghouse has been developing high temperature ceramic barrier filters for
use in advanced IGCC and pressurized fluidized bed combustor (PFBC)
systems.  The most promising of these so far, is the ceramic candle
filter unit utilizing silicon carbide filters.  A unit of this
type was currently being demonstrated at the Tidd PFBC site under
the Clean Coal Technology (CCT) Program.  Several other demonstrations
of this unit are planned under additional CCT projects including
the Tampa Electric IGCC demonstration and Sierra Pacific's Pi&ntilde;on
Pine IGCC project.  This unit will allow removal of particulates
to levels acceptable to a gas turbine expansion section.  This
unit has recently become available as a commercial offering with
the attendant performance guarantees.
<H4>Char Combustion</H4>
In this system, the fluidized bed char combustor provides the energy
for gasifier air/steam heating, and boiler heat for the steam
cycle.  Char burned in the combustor has a carbon content of approximately
87%.  The combustor operates at a temperature of 843&#176;C (1550&#176;F)
with 20% excess air.  Tubes are included in the combustor system
to provide air/steam heating and to recover heat for the steam
cycle.  Carbon conversion in the combustor was assumed to be essentially
complete.  As discussed earlier, the commercial version of this
gasifier is likely to have very high carbon conversion (&gt; 99%).
 In this case, a char combustor would be unnecessary and energy
for air/steam heating and wood drying would be obtained from elsewhere
in the process.
<H3>Low Pressure Indirectly Heated Gasification - The BCL Gasifier</H3>
The low pressure indirectly-heated gasifier selected for this study
was developed at Battelle Columbus Laboratory specifically for
biomass gasification.  A schematic of this gasifier integrated
with the combined cycle is shown in <A HREF="#fig3">Figure 3</A>.  The distinctive
feature of the BCL unit was that unlike direct-fired gasifiers
which use both steam and air, only steam was injected with the
biomass to promote gasification.  Therefore, the fuel gas has
a higher heating value than that produced by direct-fired gasifiers.
 Without rehumidifying the fuel gas, the higher heating value
of the fuel gas is 16.4 MJ/m3 (441 Btu/scf); if the fuel gas is
rehumidified to 20% by weight, its higher heating value is 14.2
MJ/m3 (379 Btu/scf).  The heat necessary for the endothermic gasification
reactions was supplied by sand circulating between a fluidized
bed char combustor and the gasification vessel.  In addition to
acting as the heat source, the sand was the bed material for the
gasifier, designed as an entrained fluidized bed reactor.  Of
the total amount of sand circulating between the gasifier and
char combustor, 0.5% is purged to prevent ash build-up in the
system.  Because this stream is nearly 100% sand, it is likely
that its means of disposal would not be subject to the same requirements
as pure ash from directly-heated gasifier systems.

This integrated gasification combined cycle plant was simulated in ASPEN/SP; a
Fortran subroutine controls the simulation of the gasifier.  The
equations in this subroutine which control the component mass
balance in the gasifier were developed from regressing the experimental
data from the Battelle Columbus Laboratory 9 T/day PDU <A HREF="#7">[7]</A> <A HREF="#8">[8]</A>. Because of the low pressure, wood from the dryers was fed to
the gasifier using an injection screw feeder.  According to the
simulation, the gasifier operates at  nearly atmospheric pressure
(172 kPa, 25 psi) and 825&#176;C (1517&#176;F).  The design parameters
and operating conditions of the indirectly heated gasifier are
shown in <A HREF="#table5">Table 5</A>.  The product gas composition, calculated in
the Fortran subroutine during the ASPEN simulation is shown in
<A HREF="#table6">Table 6</A>.  The composition of the char is dependent upon the temperature
of the gasifier, which in turn is dependent upon the heat balance
between the char combustor and the gasifier.  The char composition
is determined, therefore, by the Fortran subroutine, and is shown
in <A HREF="#table7">Table 7</A>.

<H4>Drying Requirements</H4>
To assess the feasibility of operating
the low pressure indirectly-heated gasifier without a drying system,
different feedstock moisture levels were tested.  Results, showing
the relationship between moisture content of the feed versus gasifier
temperature, are shown in <A HREF="#fig4">Figure 4</A>.  These curves represent two
system designs where the air to the char combustor is fed at either
ambient conditions (15&#176;C) or is preheated to 538&#176;C.
 It was found that as the moisture level increases, the heat available
from the char is no longer sufficient to maintain gasification
and also vaporize the water in the feed.  <A HREF="#fig4">Figure 4</A> shows that
if the char combustion air is not preheated, a dryer is necessary.
 In real operation, the gasifier temperature would continue to
plummet below 650&#176;C; the curve plateaus at this point because
of the lower limit set on the gasifier temperature in the ASPEN
simulation.  Although a dryer is still deemed necessary if the
moisture content of the feed is higher than approximately 25%
and the air is preheated, the drying requirements can be reduced
from what is typically thought to be required (approximately 10%
moisture levels) and still maintain temperatures necessary for
gasification.

<H4>Gas Clean-up</H4>
Fuel gas produced by the low pressure indirectly heated gasifier was cleaned
using a tar cracker to reduce the molecular weight of the larger
hydrocarbons, and a cyclone separator to remove particulates.
A direct water quench was used to remove alkali species and cool
the gas to 97&#176;C for compression.  As an additional 
safeguard, a baghouse filter was also included to remove any fine particulates
that were not removed in the cyclone separator, and to ensure
that any alkali species that were not removed in the quench are
not fed to the compression and turbine systems.  Although a tar
cracker was not necessarily required since the gas was cooled
using a direct water quench, one was included in this design to
avoid losing the substantial heating value of the tars.
<H4>Fuel Gas Compression</H4>
Compression of the fuel gas prior to the gas turbine combustor was accomplished in
a five stage centrifugal compressor with interstage cooling. 
This series of compressors increased the pressure from 172 kPa
to 2,068 kPa (25 psi to 300 psi).  The maximum interstage temperature
was 158&#176;C, and the interstage coolers reduced the temperature
of the syngas to 93&#176;C.  This unit operation was optimized
at five stages according to the purchased equipment cost and horsepower
requirements.  After compression, the syngas is heated indirectly
to 371&#176;C with process heat from the quench and char combustor
flue gas. 
<H4>Rehumidification of the Syngas Prior to Combustion</H4>
For the indirectly-heated gasifier, the efficiency, electricity output,
and cost of electricity were also studied as a function of the
moisture level of the syngas prior to combustion in the gas turbine
combustor.  During quench and compression, the water in the syngas
is reduced to 7% by weight.  Feeding this syngas directly to the
combined cycle results in an efficiency of 35.67% and a cost of
electricity of $0.0576/kWh on a constant dollar basis.  If, however,
a portion of the water that drops out of the syngas during compression
is compressed and re-added such that the moisture content is 20%
by weight, the efficiency and constant dollar cost of electricity
are 35.40% and $0.0572/kWh, respectively.  Thus, rehumidifying
the syngas prior to combustion decreases the overall efficiency
of the system but increases the power output; this results in
a slightly lower cost of electricity, although 2% more biomass
feed is required.  Increasing the moisture level of the fuel gas
past 20% is not feasible as the gas turbine mass flow limit is
reached and the ability of the turbine combustor to burn the wood
is decreased.  Naturally, the heating value of the fuel gas is
reduced when water is added to it.  Without rehumidifying the
fuel gas, the higher heating value of the fuel gas is 16.4 MJ/m3
(441 Btu/scf); at 20% by weight, its higher heating value is 14.2
MJ/m3 (379 Btu/scf).  
<H3>Low Pressure, Air-Blown Gasification</H3>
The last commercially available gasifier type investigated was the
low pressure direct system.  The most well-known gasifier of this
type is that offered by TPS and is also known as the Studsvik
gasifier.  The TPS gasifier has been selected for the World Bank's
Global Environment Facility (GEF) project in Brazil.  The GEF
project will couple a TPS gasifier fueled with eucalyptus to a
GE LM-2500 aero-derivative gas turbine system for power generation
in northern Brazil.  The TPS gasifier was also examined in a biomass
IGCC application as part of a DOE/NREL sponsored site-specific
feasibility study conducted by Weyerhauser <A HREF="#9">[9]</A>.  Other low
pressure, direct air-blown gasifiers that have been operated with
biomass include the Lurgi circulating fluidized-bed gasifier and
the Energy Products of Idaho (EPI) gasifier.  A schematic of the
system used in this study is shown in <A HREF="#fig5">Figure 5</A>.

Unfortunately, little concrete data is publicly available on the operating conditions,
reactant ratios, and fuel gas produced by the TPS gasifier.  For
this study, therefore, data from biomass testing in a small-scale
Lurgi circulating fluidized-bed gasifier <A HREF="#10">[10]</A> was used
to estimate gasifier performance.  The operating conditions selected
for this gasifier were a temperature of 870&#176;C (1,600&#176;F)
and a pressure of 0.14 MPa (1.36 atm).  Survey of available data
on gasifiers of this type indicates that steam is rarely used
as part of the gasification process.  It was noted that the moisture
content of the dried biomass used in these gasifiers is somewhat
high (up to slightly over 20%); it is assumed that this moisture
serves as the source of "steam" for the steam-carbon gasification
reaction.  Relatively high air/biomass ratios also seem to be
common for gasifiers of this type, though again, detailed information
on this point is difficult to obtain.  <A HREF="#table8">Table 8</A> summarizes the
operating conditions for the gasifier used in this case.

In order to estimate gasifier performance and fuel gas composition, a quasi-equilibrium
model was used.  This process employed the RGIBBS model in ASPEN/SP
along with its capability to accommodate equilibrium approach
temperatures for specified reactions.  The problem was further
complicated by the lack of information on air preheat temperature.
 The problem was solved by selecting the gasifier temperature
and pressure and a probable air/biomass ratio.  The air preheat
level was adjusted to yield a heat loss expected for a unit of
this scale (1.5%), and the equilibrium approach temperatures for
the various gasification reactions adjusted to match reported
fuel gas composition.  These, of course, are not independent variables
so an iterative approach was required.  Nitrogen in the fuel gas
provided a check on the selected air/biomass ratio.  The derived
fuel gas composition after the gas cleaning and conditioning described
below is shown in <A HREF="#table9">Table 9</A>.

<H4>Gasifier Design</H4>
Owing to the aforementioned dearth of detailed information on this gasifier, it was not possible
to perform a detailed gasifier design.  Instead, the design and
cost information for the TPS gasifier case contained in the Weyerhauser
feasibility study was scaled to fit the system examined in this
report.  Portions of the following system description in this
section are extracted from the Weyerhauser final report, and additional
details can be found therein.  
<P>
Biomass is fed to the gasifier
by two screw feeders that are isolated from the upstream components
by  pressurized rotary valves.  The gasifier is a two-zone fluidized
bed rector that used sand as a bed material.  Biomass fed to the
gasifier drops into the lower, dense phase fluidized bed.  This
portion of the gasifier provides sufficient residence time for
gasification of the larger biomass particles.  Preheated primary
air enters the gasifier near the base of the vessel and maintains
fluidization of this dense portion of the bed.  Secondary air
in added above the dense bed to produce a "fast" fluidized
bed region.  In this section, remaining fuel is fully pyrolized
and gasified by the combined action of heat, air, and gas components.
 <P>
Air for gasification is extracted from the gas turbine compressor
and let down to gasifier operating pressure through a turbine.
 This generates an additional 8.4 MW<SUB>e</SUB> of power, almost half the
amount required to drive the fuel gas compressor.  The air extraction
rate in this case was such that the combined air and combustion
product mass flow through the gas turbine expansion section and,
thus the power output, was not significantly different from the
design values on natural gas.
<H4>Gas Clean-up</H4>
Fuel gas exiting the gasifier cyclones enters a circulating fluidized
bed tar cracking unit.  This unit reduces the quantity of higher
hydrocarbon species in the fuel gas that could otherwise foul
the fuel gas cooler, plug the fabric filters, and increase wastewater
treatment loads from the gas scrubber.  Dolomite is used as the
bed material in the tar cracker.  The higher temperature of the
tar cracker (920&#176;C, 1688&#176;F) also ensures conversion
of any un-gasified solids that escape the gasifier.
<P>
After exiting the second stage tar cracker cyclone, the fuel gas enters the
syngas cooler.  In a slight modification to the Weyerhauser report
design, this unit is used to preheat gasification air as well
as provide heat to the steam cycle.  In actual practice, the potential
safety risk of this scheme would have to be carefully evaluated
though we have some assurances that such an approach is feasible<A HREF="#11">[11]</A>.
 In the syngas cooler, the temperature of the fuel gas is reduced
to 288&#176;C (550&#176;F).
<P>
Any particulates remaining in the fuel gas are removed in a bag filter unit.  As the fuel gas is
cooled, volatile alkali species present in the gas stream condense
on the remaining particulate matter and are removed from the system
by the filter bags.  The particulate-free fuel gas is cooled further
in a direct contact water scrubber that removes any trace higher
hydrocarbons and most of the water in the fuel gas stream.  This
operation also removes a significant amount of the ammonia from
the fuel gas.  Following this step, the gas is further washed
with a dilute sulfuric acid stream.  These combined steps remove
over 95% of the ammonia from the fuel gas.  This ammonia would
otherwise be likely to produce NO<SUB>x</SUB> in the gas turbine combustor.
 Purge streams from both towers are sent to wastewater treatment.
 The fuel gas then enters a knockout drum prior to the fuel gas
compressors.
<H4>Fuel Gas Compression</H4>
Following final fuel gas cleaning, the fuel gas is compressed for introduction
into the gas turbine combustor.  Although the turbine pressure
ratio is only 14.9, the fuel gas is compressed to 1.89 MPa (18.6
atm) to allow for pressure drop across the fuel control valve.
 This compression is accomplished in a multi-stage, inter-cooled
centrifugal compressor.  This portion of the process was not detailed
in the Weyerhauser report and so was evaluated as part of the
ASPEN/SPsimulation.  It was noted that fewer compression/inter-cooling
stages were required to maintain gas temperature within acceptable
limits in this case than in the indirect gasifier case.  Presumably
this is due to differences in the gas composition.
<H3>Combined Cycle Power Generation</H3>
Since the output, performance, and conditions of the combined cycles
vary across the cases examined, only the general features of the
power island are discussed here.  Output and efficiency data are
contained later in the discussion of the results of this study.
 All of the equipment discussed in this section was commercially
available.  The MS-6101FA gas turbine will see its first commercial
demonstration at Sierra Pacific's Pi&ntilde;on Pine IGCC plant
being funded under DOE's Clean Coal Technology Program.
<H4>Gas Turbine</H4>
Hot (538&#176;C for the pressurized gasifier system, 371&#176;C for the low pressure indirectly-heated
gasifier system, 225&#176;C for the low pressure direct gasifier)
clean fuel gas is introduced into the gas turbine combustor along
with air from the high pressure turbine compressor.  All scenarios
tested, including those with direct quench produced fuel gas that
was well within the projected requirements for combustion of low
energy content gas in gas turbines.  The use of a direct quench
or humidification in some of the systems studied produces a fuel
gas with higher moisture levels which helps reduce formation of
nitrogen oxides in the combustor and increases the mass flow through
the turbine expander and, thus, the turbine's power output.  However,
in all if the cases studied, the overall increase in mass flow
through the turbine expander was less than 10% since the increased
flow of low energy content fuel gas was partially offset by gasification
air extracted from the compressor discharge.
<P>
An important technical qualification to selection of the turbines in this study is the
ability to extract gasification air for the air-blown gasifiers
from the compressor discharge.  This extraction was necessary
not only to realize the efficiency benefits of tight integration,
but to maintain compressor/turbine power balance.  Because of
the reduced heating value of the gasifier product gas, a larger
amount of this fuel gas (compared to natural gas) was required
to achieve design turbine firing temperatures.  This additional
fuel can increase the mass flow into the turbine section, depending
on the amount of air extracted, and thus the turbine's power output.
 Without air extraction, this increase can cause compressor stall.
 In the case of the indirectly heated gasifier, air extraction
is probably not necessary because the fuel gas produced is of
a medium heat content.  The air/biomass ratio for the low pressure
direct gasifier (and thus the air extraction rate) is such that
the turbine mass flow and power output is essentially unchanged
from the natural gas design values.
<P>
The aero-derivative gas turbine
selected for this study was the General Electric LM5000PC.  The
LM5000 has a higher pressure ratio (24.8) and firing temperature
(in excess of 1150&#176;C) than the utility machines selected
for previous biomass IGCC studies.  The smaller size turbines
used in earlier studies were selected because of the smaller amounts
of biomass fuel available compared to systems using coal or natural
gas.  Unfortunately, small scale utility turbines are generally
the last to benefit from technological advances in the field.
 Therefore, resulting system efficiencies were correspondingly
low relative to coal or gas IGCC systems.  One of the goals of
this study was to evaluate the effect the latest turbines had
on biomass system efficiency.  A combined cycle was selected rather
than the steam-injected LM5000 because of the lower water usage
required for the combined cycle.  This allows maximum flexibility
for siting the plant, reduces feed water treating, and conserves
water resources.  The similarly sized and higher efficiency LM-6000
turbine was not selected for the study because of its even higher
pressure ratio of 30.
<P>
Air extraction has not yet been demonstrated
with the LM5000 gas turbine; however, an investigation of the
feasibility and mechanics of this practice has been investigated
by DOE's Fossil Energy program and such a scheme has been investigated
with the related LM2500 turbine being used in the GEF project.
 General Electric and other turbine manufacturers are incorporating
air extraction provisions into some utility turbine designs including
the MS-6101FA discussed below.  Westinghouse also commercially
offers for biomass-derived as well as natural gas fuels, the 251B12
"ECONOPAC&#153;" combined cycle system.  This package
is nominally rated at 50 MW, includes low-NO<SUB>x</SUB> combustion technology,
and has a net efficiency of 46.5% (LHV basis) on natural gas fuel.
<P>
 Within the last few years, a smaller, advanced utility gas turbine
has also become available, the GE MS-6101FA.  This turbine moves
GE's "F" technology (high firing temperature, high efficiency)
down from the company's 160 MW MS-7221FA machine to a 70 MW class
machine.  This increases the Frame 6 efficiency to 34.2% (simple
cycle, LHV, natural gas) from the 30% range previously typical
for this scale and type of machine.  The increased mass flow and
temperature of the turbine exhaust also allows the use of more
sophisticated steam cycles in this size range.  The pressure ratio
of utility machines (14.9 for the 6FA) was also more compatible
with demonstrated biomass gasifier operation.  Further, the MS-6101FA
is able to accommodate extraction of up to 20% of the compressor
discharge flow to supply a gasifier<A HREF="#12">[12]</A>.  A recent Gas Turbine
World article <A HREF="#13">[13]</A> also discusses GE's 20% uprate of this
turbine's power output when fueled with synthesis gas.   For these
reasons, systems incorporating the Frame 6FA turbine were also
evaluated.  It was believed that the substantially increased efficiency
would offset the system size increase and keep the feed requirements
within what might be available from a dedicated feedstock supply
system (DFSS).
<H4>Heat Recovery Steam Generator</H4>
Gas turbine exhaust was ducted to the heat recovery steam generator
(HRSG).  For the LM5000 based cases, the HRSG design and conditions
were derived from published information on the LM5000 steam-injected
turbine <A HREF="#14">[14]</A>.  This was done to avoid issues of availability
of high performance HRSG's for small-scale turbines and the associated
cost data.  The HRSG incorporates a superheater, high and low
pressure boilers and economizers.  Superheated steam (394&#176;C,
5.3 MPa) was provided for the gasifier and the steam cycle.  Medium
pressure steam (1.4 MPa) was also provided for the steam cycle.
 The exhaust temperature from the HRSG in all cases, 140&#176;C
(284&#176;F), was sufficiently high to avoid any possible corrosion
in the stack and to mitigate plume visibility issues.
<P>
Given the higher turbine exhaust temperature (618&#176;C, 1145&#176;F),
a more complicated HRSG was utilized for the systems integrated
with the MS-6101FA gas turbine.  In this case, the HRSG provides
steam superheating and steam reheat, as well as the high and low
pressure boilers and economizers.  For all designs, HRSG's were
designed with superheater temperature approaches of  16-33&#176;C
(30-60&#176;F) and pinch points of 22&#176;C (40&#176;F).  Boiler
blowdown was assumed to be 2%, and feedwater heating and deaeration
are performed in the HRSG system.  All feedwater pumps are motor
driven rather than steam turbine driven.  In all direct gasifier
systems studied, supplemental heat for drying is provided by flue
gas extraction from an appropriate point in the HRSG.
<H4>Steam Turbine System</H4>
The steam turbine system for the LM5000 cases was relative simple comprising
high (HP) and low pressure (LP) power turbines and a generator.
 Superheated steam (394&#176;C, 5.3 MPa) was introduced into the
high pressure turbine and expanded to 1.4 MPa (200 psia).  Exhaust
from the HP turbine was combined with additional steam from the
LP boiler and introduced to the LP turbine which exhausts to the
condenser at 6,900 Pa (2 in. Hg).
<P>
For the MS-6101FA case, the
steam cycle was somewhat more advanced.  Superheated steam at
538&#176;C and 10 MPa (1000&#176;F, 1465 psia) was expanded in
the HP turbine.  Gasification steam, where required, was extracted
from the HP exhaust.  The remaining steam was combined with steam
from the LP boiler, reheated, and introduced into the intermediate
pressure (IP) turbine.  Exhaust from the IP turbine was passed
though the LP turbine and condensed at 6,900 Pa (2 in. Hg).  Expanded
steam quality leaving the LP turbine in all cases was 90 per cent.
 Assumed generator efficiency was 98.5%.
<H4>General Facilities</H4>
A mechanical induced-draft cooling tower was assumed for each design.
 This includes all of the necessary pumps for condenser cooling
and makeup water needs.  Balance of plant equipment includes plant
water supply and demineralization facilities, firewater system,
waste water treating, service and instrument air system, and the
electric auxiliary systems.  General facilities included are roads,
administrative, laboratory and maintenance buildings, potable
water and sanitary facilities, lighting, heating and air conditioning,
flare, fire water system, startup fuel system, and all necessary
computer control systems.  In addition, the greenfield case included
costs for land and land development, as well as an electrical
substation for transmission access.
<H3>Overall System Performance</H3>
Process conditions and system performance for each of the cases examined
are summarized in <A HREF="#table10">Table 10</A>.  Net system output ranges from 55.5
MW<SUB>e</SUB> for the LM5000 cases to 131.7 MW<SUB>e</SUB> for the high pressure gasifier
MS6101FA case.  Net system efficiency ranges from 35.4% for the
low pressure indirect gasifier case to 39.7 for the high pressure
gasifier MS-6101FA case.  Gas turbine output and efficiency based
on fuel heating value are greater than those listed in the literature
for natural gas fuel.  These increases are primarily the result
of high fuel gas temperatures and the increased mass flow through
the turbine expander (due to lower energy content fuel gas). 
The gas turbine power output in the high pressure gasifier case
is in excess of the 20% performance augmentation claimed by GE
for their turbine operated on synthesis gas fuel.  The turbine
may need to be de-rated in this case using more sophisticated
modeling techniques. 
<P>
The performance results from the simulation
demonstrate a number of salient points.  It was clear that use
of advanced turbine technology results in significant efficiency
gains.  Predicted efficiency of the worst case considered was
nearly eight percentage points higher than the best previous biomass
IGCC system study.  It is also clear that the lower gas turbine
efficiency of the MS-6101F (as compared to the LM5000) was more
than compensated by the more advanced steam cycle that was possible
with its increased exhaust flowrate and temperature.

<H3>Economic Analysis</H3>
The selling price of electricity in 1990 (the base year for this report) was $0.047/kWh,
$0.073/kWh, and $0.078/kWh for industrial, commercial, and residential
customers, respectively (EIA, Annual Energy Review, 1993).  By
calculating the economics of the processes being studied and comparing
the results to the prices within the electricity generating market,
the potential profitability can be assessed.
<H4>Economic Analysis Methodology</H4>
The levelized cost of electricity from three BIGCC systems was calculated by setting
the net present value of the investment to zero.  The method and
assumptions that were used are based on those described in the
EPRI Technical Assessment Guide (TAG) <A HREF="#15">[15]</A> and reflect typical utility
financing parameters.  Independent power producers or cogenerators
would clearly have different analysis criteria.  The spreadsheet
used for COE calculations was developed at DOE's Morgantown Energy
Technology Center.  A summary of the economic assumptions is presented
in <A HREF="#table11">Table 11</A>.

<H4>Capital Cost Estimates</H4>
Capital costs for the systems were
estimated using a combination of capacity factored and equipment-based
estimates.  Capacity factored estimates utilize the ratio of the
capacity (flowrate, heat duty, etc.) of  an existing piece of
equipment to the new equipment multiplied by the cost of the existing
equipment to estimate the cost of the new equipment. A scale-up
factor particular to the equipment type was applied to the capacity
ratio.  The equipment-based estimates were determined from more
detailed equipment design calculations based on the process conditions
and results of the simulations.  All costs were estimated in instantaneous
1990 dollars.  Where necessary, costs were corrected to 1990 using
the M&S or Chemical Engineering equipment cost indices.  A
charge of 20% of the installed cost of the major plant sections
was taken to account for all balance of plant (BOP) equipment
and facilities.  Additional costs a for substation and land were
included for the greenfield case.  The major equipment costs were
multiplied by a factor to arrive at the total direct cost of the
installed equipment.  <A HREF="#table12">Table 12</A> lists the factors used to determine
total direct cost.  In the design of the various pieces of process
equipment, every effort was made to specify units that were modular
and capable of being shop fabricated and shipped by rail.  It
was believed that this approach will help keep capital costs low
and shorten  the learning curve in deployment of plants of this
type.

<H4>Wood Preparation and Drying Costs</H4>
The majority of the equipment necessary for solids handling, storage,
sizing, and conveying was scaled from a study performed by Tecogen
for a similar sized IGCC plant based on the BCL indirectly heated
gasifier <A HREF="#16">[16]</A>.  A magnetic separator was added as one was not
explicitly included in the Tecogen analysis.  Costs for the separator
were determined from a detailed study on wood handling equipment
<A HREF="#17">[17]</A>.  The dryers were sized based on the methodology outline
in the Tecogen study and the costs were developed from Perry's
Chemical Engineers' Handbook <A HREF="#18">[18]</A>.  A baghouse was added
to remove wood particles from the dryer exit.  Costs for the baghouse
were developed used the CHEMCOST program.  The equipment included
in the wood preparation and drying section includes the following:
truck unloaders and truck scales, chip yard handling equipment,
one week storage paved chip yard, one day storage silo, sizing
bin/chip hogger, conveyor/bucket elevator, magnetic separator,
rotary drum dryers, and baghouse filter.
<H4>Gasification Costs</H4>
The costs of the high pressure air-blown gasifier and its associated
equipment were initially based on work done for EPRI by Southern
Company Services <A HREF="#19">[19]</A>.  Because of the similarities in design
and operating conditions, the cost for the gasifier and its associated
equipment was based on that for the Kellogg-Rust-Westinghouse
(KRW) coal gasifier.  While the report was being revised and finalized,
however, more recent and applicable cost data became available.
 In May of 1995, Northern States Power (NSP) completed a report
on a site-specific feasibility study that evaluated biomass gasification
combined cycle technology for rural power generation <A HREF="#20">[20]</A>.
 This report included cost estimates for the Tampella Power Systems
(not associated in any way with TPS) biomass gasifier.  Tampella
are a licensee of the IGT gasifier technology and it is believed
that their design and costs are representative of the high-pressure
gasifier used in this study.  Therefore, the gasification section
cost contained in the NSP report was scaled and modified to reflect
a projected n<SUP>th</SUP> plant cost and used in the final version of the
cost figures for systems incorporating the high pressure direct
gasifier.  These revised, higher, costs also reflect the consensus
position on the cost of n<SUP>th</SUP> plant biomass IGCC systems developed
in discussions with EPRI, Princeton, Colorado School of Mines,
and others and documented in an EPRI paper <A HREF="#21">[21]</A>.  The original
cost figures can be found in an ASME paper by the authors <A HREF="#22">[22]</A>.
 For the utility turbine case, two gasification trains of equal
size were used to provide the required quantity of fuel gas to
the turbine.  The boost compressor for the gasification air was
sized based on  the ASPEN/SP simulation and its cost determined
from a standard references <A HREF="#23">[23]</A>,<A HREF="#24">[24]</A>,<A HREF="#25">[25]</A>,<A HREF="#26">[26]</A>.
<P>
The costs associated with the low pressure indirectly heated
gasifier were determined by studying and evaluating the accuracy
of costs developed by several independent sources <A HREF="#27">[27]</A>,<A HREF="#28">[28]</A>,<A HREF="#29">[29]</A>,<A HREF="#30">[30]</A>.
 It was assumed that two gasification trains of equal capacity
will be needed.  Equipment included in the gasification section
include the gasifier, char combustor, char combustor cyclone,
sand surge pots, ash cyclone, sand makeup hopper, startup burner
and blower, and steam supply valves.
<P>
The costs of the low pressure
air-blown gasifier were developed from information contained in
the Weyerhauser feasibility study <A HREF="#31">[31]</A> for the TPS gasification
system.  The capital costs are reported by overall plant section
(e.g. "Gasification", "Power Block") so detailed
analysis and scaling was not possible for each piece of equipment.
 Given that the gasification system design was essentially identical
to that used in our simulation, the entire gasification section
cost was scaled to the size required for use with an MS-6101FA
gas turbine using an overall scale factor of 0.8.  This assumes,
of course, that a single train could be increased in scale by
60%.  Otherwise, two parallel trains would be required.  This
would increase the gasification section capital cost by approximately
15%.
<H4>Gas Clean-up Costs</H4>
<STRONG>Tar cracker</STRONG><BR>
The initial tar cracker design was
developed using laboratory data <A HREF="#32">[32]</A> including space velocities
of 2000 hr<SUP>-1</SUP>;  however, this resulted in extremely large and shallow
beds.  Further examination of the laboratory data revealed that
very large space velocities were utilized to quickly test catalyst
life.  Therefore, a reduced space velocity (35% of the lab value)
was adopted for the design.  This resulted in reasonable superficial
gas velocities and a vessel size of 4.26 x 12.8 meters (14 x 42
ft.).  The module cost for the tar cracker was determined using
the CHEMCOST program and the cost factor applied.
<P>
<STRONG>High temperature gas cooling</STRONG><BR>
For the cases that used a direct quench, the cost of a quench pump
was determined with the CHEMCOST program.  For the indirect gas
cooling case, the area and size of the heat exchanger required
was calculated utilizing standard methods <A HREF="#33">[33]</A> and based on
data from the system simulation.  The cost of this indirect cooler
was determined from the CHEMCOST program.  In both cases, a cost
factor of 0.7 was applied to the basic equipment cost.
<P>
<STRONG>High temperature particulate removal</STRONG><BR>
Based on information supplied by the equipment vendor <A HREF="#34">[34]</A>, it was
believed that a hot gas filtration unit similar in size to that
being demonstrated with the Tidd pressurized fluidized bed combustor
(PFBC) system under the Clean Coal Program would be appropriate
for a gasification train of the size being evaluated in this report.
 The vendor supplied an FOB cost for the hot gas filtration unit.
 The installation factor applied to the particulate filter was
reduced slightly given the highly modular, shop fabricated nature
of the unit.  This cost was further confirmed against data contained
in the NSP report which used a similar system.
<H4>Compression Costs for Low Pressure Gasifier Systems</H4>
In the low pressure indirectly heated gasifier plant, a five stage
compression system with interstage cooling was used to boost the
pressure of the syngas prior to combustion in the gas turbine
combustor. The purchase price and total power requirement for
this compression operation were estimated to be $3.8 MM and 9.6
MW<SUB>e</SUB>, respectively.  This unit was optimized at five stages according
to the purchased cost and horsepower requirements which were higher
for both four stage ($4.1 MM, 9.7 MW<SUB>e</SUB>) and six stage ($3.9 MM,
9.7 MW<SUB>e</SUB>) compression systems.
<P>
The cost for the fuel gas compressor
is included in the gasification section system cost from the Weyerhauser
report that was used to develop an overall cost for the gasification
system up to the combined cycle system.  Therefore, cost details
for the compressor itself are not available.  Data from the ASPEN
simulation indicates that two or three compressor stages with
inter-cooling would be required to raise the fuel gas to the necessary
pressure.  The number of stages is largely constrained by the
allowable outlet temperature of each stage and the thermodynamic
characteristics of the fuel gas.
<H4>Char Combustor Cost for High Pressure Gasifier System</H4>
The base cost for the char combustor for the direct gasification systems
was determined from the ENFOR reports <A HREF="#35">[35]</A> on commercially available
equipment for wood combustion and the result independently confirmed
<A HREF="#36">[36]</A>.  The size was determined based on the heat duty of
the unit.  The total cost for the combustor system was reduced
by 30% from that found in the ENFOR reports, since a substantial
fraction of the heat recovery in the commercial system (and therefore
a substantial fraction of the heat exchange area) was not needed
for this application.  The system cost included the feed system,
primary air, boil, and ash removal system.  The final cost for
the wood handling and drying section was compared with an independent
cost estimate for a system of similar size<A HREF="#37">[37]</A>, and found
to be similar.
<P>
As discussed earlier, if gasifier carbon conversion
achieves high levels in the final commercial, this plant section
will not be required.  This would result in a total capital requirement
savings of $2.1 million in the aero-derivative turbine case and
$3.3 million in the utility gas turbine case as well as an indeterminate
amount of O&M expense.
<H4>Combined Cycle Power Generation Costs</H4>
<STRONG>Gas Turbine</STRONG><BR>
Costs for the gas turbines utilized
in this study were determined from published data <A HREF="#38">[38]</A> or from
the manufacturer.  Again, installation factors were slightly reduced
because of the modular nature of the gas turbines and associated
equipment.
<P>
<STRONG>Heat Recovery Steam Generator</STRONG><BR>
The cost of the HRSG for the LM5000 turbine was estimated  from  published
sources <A HREF="#39">[39]</A>, <A HREF="#40">[40]</A>.  The HRSG cost for the MS-6101FA
turbine was scaled from the cost for a similar unit for the MS-7001FA
turbine <A HREF="#41">[41]</A>.
<P>
<STRONG>Steam Turbine System</STRONG><BR>
The cost for the steam cycles for both systems were determined from
capacity costs ($/kW) from a number of sources <A HREF="#42">[42]</A>, <A HREF="#43">[43]</A>, <A HREF="#44">[44]</A>.  The estimated cost included all ancillary equipment for the cycle including mechanical draft cooling tower, feedwater
pumps, condenser, etc, and was estimated to be $250/kW of the
steam turbine output for the large steam cycles and $350/kW for
the smaller steam cycles.
<H4>Total Plant Cost, Total Plant Investment, and Total Capital Requirements</H4>
To obtain the total plant cost (TPC), capital costs were added to
the installed equipment cost for general plant facilities (10% of process plant cost), engineering fees (15%), and project contingency (15% of process plant cost + general plant facilities
cost).  The percentages were selected from ranges provided in
EPRI TAG <A HREF="#45">[45]</A>.  No process contingencies were applied to the
individual plant sections as this was assumed to be a mature plant.
<P>
The total plant investment (TPI) was determined by adding the
interest cost plus inflation to the TPC.  The period of construction
was assumed to be 2 years and construction interest was assumed
to be 4.5%.  The total capital requirement (TCR) for the plant
was the sum of the TPC, TPI, royalties, startup costs, initial
catalyst and chemicals, working capital, spare parts, and land
(where applicable).  A summary of the capital costs for each case
was contained in <A HREF="#table13">Table 13</A>.
<H4>Operation and Maintenance Costs</H4>
Operating and maintenance costs for the plant were based on an 80% capacity
factor.  Wood costs were assumed to be $46/Mg ($42 per bone dry
ton).  It was assumed that 2 operators per shift were required
for the LM5000 based systems, and 5 operators per shift for the
MS6101FA based system.  This number of operators is substantially
reduced over the EPRI TAG numbers and those contained in our earlier
evaluation.  This revised estimate is a result of developing operating
trends and the consensus position arrived at between NREL, EPRI,
Princeton, and others.  A summary of annual operating costs for
each case is contained in <A HREF="#table14">Table 14</A>.  Ash disposal costs for the
indirectly-heated gasifier case are significantly higher than
in the other cases because a large amount of sand was purged to
prevent build-up of ash in the system.  It is likely that this
sand stream will not be disposed of in the same manner as pure
ash streams from the other gasifiers, but a more conservative
approach was taken in assuming the cost per tonne was the same.

<H3>Analysis, Discussion, and Conclusions</H3>
It is clear from these analyses that gasification/turbine systems
can produce electricity at up to twice the average efficiency
of today's biomass power industry.  The highest efficiency system
examined here uses an advanced utility-scale gas turbine (the GE
MS6101FA).  Such a system benefits not only from economy of scale,
but from the increased turbine efficiency and, perhaps most significantly,
the reheat steam cycle that is feasible at this scale and turbine
exhaust temperature.
<P>
Historically, generating systems of this
scale (&gt; 100 MW<SUB>e</SUB>) have been deemed infeasible for biomass-based
systems because of the associated feedstock requirements.  However,
the use of advanced combined-cycle technology reduces fuel requirements
to manageable levels because of the striking increase in generating
efficiency.  Also, smaller, industrial-scale, gas turbines with
very high efficiencies are being developed under the UDSOE's Advanced
Turbine System (ATS) program.  These are likely to be attractive
for biomass systems as they will require reduced quantities of
biomass to access high efficiency turbine systems.
<P>
Complementary to this trend is the development of dedicated feedstock supply
systems that are intended to sustainably supply larger quantities
of feedstock than were heretofore available.  Properly managed,
these trends are positioned to merge and provide a new generation
of high-efficiency and cost-competitive biomass-based electricity
generating stations.
<P>
It is also clear from this study however that
even the most promising electricity cost from biomass is higher
than currently quoted avoided costs and new, high-efficiency natural
gas combined cycle systems.  This is certainly one of the challenges
faced by the industry today.  Deregulation is likely to bring
many opportunities as well as challenges however.  Among these
are capturing the market for "green power" demonstrated
by innumerable public surveys.  Also promising is deployment of
these technologies into the cogeneration and distributed generation
markets.  This avoids head-to-head competition with large central
station fossil-fueled plants.  Additionally, such systems may
have access to low cost feedstocks or favorable treatment by regulatory
bodies.  Smaller scale distributed generations systems employing
industrial turbines or fuel cells are also applicable to the burgeoning
international market for electricity generation.
<P>
Advanced utilization
systems are currently under development that hold the potential
for even more significant improvements in cost and efficiency
than the systems examined here.  It is important to continue development
and demonstration of current technology and dedicated feedstock
supply systems to be positioned to take advantage of these advances.
