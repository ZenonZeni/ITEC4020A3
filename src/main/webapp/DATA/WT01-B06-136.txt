Oocyte Donation<p>
</b><p>
<p>
<p>
Many women are unable to conceive because their ovaries do not produce healthy
eggs.  Oocyte donation gives these women the opportunity to get pregnant.
Women who may benefit from this procedure are women born without ovaries, women
whose ovaries have been removed due to endometriosis/tumors or damaged by
radiation/ chemotherapy, women whose ovaries do not function properly because
of age or chromosomal abnormalities, and women whose eggs did not fertilize
after in vitro fertilization (IVF).<p>
<p>
In the past several years, oocyte donation has become more and more popular
because it is so successful.  At the end of 1993, more than 2500 babies had
been born by oocyte donation.  The success rate of this procedure can be up to
50 percent, which is higher than any other method available.  The uterus does
not "age" as quickly as as the ovaries, and that is why even menopausal women
have been able to get pregnant with this technique.<p>
<p>
The oocyte donation procedure starts with the use of medications to synchronize
the donor and recipient menstrual cycles.  Once they are synchronized, the
donor receives injections of fertility medications that produce a number of
eggs in her ovaries. When the eggs have developed to the right stage, the eggs
are removed with a small needle inserted through the vagina.  The eggs are
fertilized in the laboratory with the partner's (or donor) sperm.  The
fertilized eggs develop into embryos, which are placed into the uterus of the
recipient two days later.  At the time the donor starts her fertility
medications, the recipient also starts hormonal therapy in order to get the
lining of her uterus ready for the embryos.  After the embryos are transferred,
the recipient continues hormonal therapy for a few months.<p>
<p>
Donor selection can be arranged privately, such as using a sister or friend, or
it can be provided through a recruitment agency.  Recruitment agencies have
their own fee schedules, but typically charge about $5,000 to recruit and
compensate the donor.  All egg donors are screened for any family history of
birth defects or hereditary diseases.  They also undergo psychological and
medical screening, and they are tested for infectious diseases.  The best
donors are usually women under 35 who have been pregnant previously, but donors
up to the age of 40 can be suitable in certain circumstances.<p>
<p>
The major risks of being an egg donor recipient are the risks associated with
pregnancy, (e.g. miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, premature labor, cesarean
section). Other risks can result from medications or a transmitted infection.
The medications used to synchronize the menstrual cycles can cause annoying
symptoms, such as hot flushes, mood swings, and headaches.  And, even though
the donors are screened for infectious diseases, it is not possible to
completely eliminate the risk of infection.  Finally, there is the possibility
that the donor may not respond appropriately to the medicine, that her eggs may
not fertilize, or that the recipient may not get pregnant.<p>
