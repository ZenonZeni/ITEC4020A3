ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="w2.gif" ALT="W">hen I first met Walt Weisel, nearly 20 years
ago, he was working with robotic equipment (he's been with major robot
companies, including Unimation and Prab). That equipment was programmed through
a hand-held device that an operator used to move the arm to the required
locations, then to enter the points in space. Generally, it would be a matter of
programming a robot to perform spot welding of automotive bodies-in-white, which
was certainly a burgeoning application in the early days. It was a matter of
moving the arm, making sure it was at the right location, adjusting if
necessary, entering the point, moving to the next position, and so on.<BR><IMG
SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">One major downside of this approach, of
course, Is that the equipment was tied up for a long time for setup, which
wasn't beneficial from the standpoint of providing a return on what was then
perceived to be a somewhat risky investment. Programming is essential for
production, but there's no production going on during programming.<IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="prod295.gif" ALT="workcell" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10"><BR><IMG
SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">If there were changes-say the door aperture
was modified-then it was back to this manual programming approach. (Editing
wasn't then what it is now, so it was often tedium upon tedium.)<BR><IMG
SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">A significant change came when off-line
programming was developed for robotic systems. With this change, people could
view not merely the image of a single robot and the workpiece on a CRT, but an
entire system, including the peripherals. This allows programming to be
performed -while or even before-equipment was on order or while it was operating
in existing applications. Which takes care of that payback tie-up to a degree.<BR><IMG
SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">However, Walt Weisel, who is now the president
&amp; CEO of International Business Link (Ft. Myers Beach, FL), which has
recently formed a new company called Robotic Workspace Technologies, maintains
that off-line robotic programming isn't all that it is cracked up to be, and
that the manual programming approach, while not as extensive, still remains a
necessary activity. &quot;If an off-line program is able to get the arm to a
position within 1/4-in,&quot; Weisel maintains, &quot;it is phenomenally close.
He explains that what is the ordinary course of affairs includes manually
tweaking the program after it has been developed. For one thing, he says, not
all robotic arms have the same characteristics and kinematics - even robots of
the same brand, same model. In addition, locating things on the floor is a whole
lot different from locating them on a computer screen. These differences must be
dealt with in real life, which turns into real money: Weisel estimates as much
as $55,000 per workstation. Which binds up the payback potential, to a degree,
once again.<BR><IMG SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">So he has identified a
problem. What's his solution?<BR><IMG SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">It's a
PC-based off-line programming package named &quot;Workspace 3&quot; that, Weisel
maintains, can generate the robot program in a background mode while the
simulation is being created; this program is being developed in the robot's own
language, be it Karel, ARLA, VAL, or others. The simulation is in 3D and in
color, and, Weisel admits, isn't as attractive as the screens generated by the
more full-blown robotic simulation packages-then he points out the price for
Workspace is S26,000.<BR><IMG SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Weisel is not
trying to supplant the bigger simulation vendors. Rather, he maintains that what
happens is what the workstation-based simulation packages are used to create
off-line programs that are then passed down to the plant level; the people who
created them then move on to the next simulation project, leaving the plant
people to tweak the program. He says Workspace is a tool for the people in the
plant who need to get the robots to work as needed.
<BR><IMG SRC="20space.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">As for the knowing precisely where
the robot is in space: There is an option called Robotrak, which consists of a
robot end-effector interface; an ISA interface card; a reference bar; the
Workspace software with the calibration option; and encoders. The encoders use a
non-stretch Dacron cord. The encoders are located; locations are established;
and then the cords are attached to the end effector. As the arm moves through
space, the robot is calibrated to within 0.008 in., according to Weisel.-GSV
