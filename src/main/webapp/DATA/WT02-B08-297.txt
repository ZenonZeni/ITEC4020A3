<H1>What is Ocean Circulation?</H1>
<p>
<p>
<h3>
Ocean water density is controlled by temperature and salinity.  When ocean water evaporates, it makes the water denser:  it lowers the temperature and increases the salinity. 
<p>
In general, the ocean can be divided into two layers: a thin upper layer whose density is lower because it is warmed by the sun, and a thick lower layer, which is denser and only a few degrees above the freezing point.  
<p>
The rotation of the Earth affects ocean height and the direction of currents as shown below.  
<p>

<p>
In the Northern hemisphere, the currents are forced to the right -- this creates "hills" in areas of clockwise-flowing currents and "valleys" where the flow is counterclockwise.  In the Southern hemisphere, currents are driven toward the left, and the effect on sea height is reversed.  TOPEX/Poseidon's basic goal is to measure the ocean's "hills" and "valleys" and model ocean circulation based on ocean <a href=topo_def.html> topography.</a>
