Keeping Pace With the Market: A Guide to Index Funds </H2><P>
<HR>

If you can't beat it, join it--the stock market, that is, as defined by an index.<P>


That is an oversimplification of the index fund concept. But apparently many investors are buying in to the idea--the popularity of these funds has grown enormously over the past few years, and the number of index funds has proliferated.<P>


A stock index fund is designed to track a stock market index, such as the Standard & Poor's 500, by either owning all or a statistically representative sample of the securities in the index. They are referred to as "passively managed" funds because there are no active investment decisions made.<P>


Index funds have several practical advantages over actively managed funds. First, because there are no real investment decisions that must be made, management fees can be extremely low, and expenses held down.<P>


In addition, portfolio turnover should be low, since the only sales and purchases that are made are those necessary for the fund to stay fully invested in the proper proportions to mirror the index being tracked. This keeps transaction costs low. For individuals investing with taxable money, a low portfolio turnover results in fewer taxable capital gains distributions.<P>


To outperform an index fund without added risk, an active manager must better the index by an amount greater than his additional expenses and transaction costs.<P>


Finally, active management can skew a portfolio toward a particular market segment. An index fund that tracks a broad-based index is, by definition, truly diversified. And it is always fully invested in the market.<P>


The concept sounds simple to implement. With so many seemingly similar funds to choose from, does it matter which one you pick?<P>


Needless to say, there are a number of considerations.<P>


Probably the most important consideration is the index that you want to track. By far the most popular index among the funds is the Standard & Poor's 500, an index that emphasizes large capitalization companies and represents about 70% of the U.S. stock market. One advantage to an investor choosing this is the wide availability of information on the S&P 500, including the stocks composing it and its performance. Another advantage is that it enables the fund manager to use S&P 500 stock index futures to provide liquidity for fund redemptions, yet remain fully invested in the stock market index.<P>


Other indexes are also followed. Some of these are not as easy to track by individuals as the S&P 500, such as the Schwab 1000, or an index of the 80 to 100 largest stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Several index funds track small-stock indexes, which can be independently followed. Three index funds cover international indexes.<P>


Finally, several index funds track specific market sectors. While these funds have "index" in their names, they are more useful to investors interested in sector funds and are not listed here.<P>


Clearly, from their names most of these indexes cover a large number of stocks. That doesn't necessarily mean that the index fund owns every single stock in the index. Instead, many use a "statistically select" group of stocks that are representative of the index as a whole. The funds most likely to use statistical sampling rather than complete representation are those that track a large number of stocks, and those that have a smaller amount of assets under management, in particular the newer funds.<P>


Obviously, the more successful the fund is at statistical sampling, the better. And the only way to check this is to see how closely the fund's performance parallels the index it is tracking. If the sampling is done properly, the fund should underperform the index by an amount greater than but close to its expense ratio (transaction costs further reduce performance). The newer the fund, the more difficult it is to determine this.<P>


Whether the fund invests in all the stocks or some, the biggest single indicator of how closely the fund will track the index is the expense ratio.<P>


In concept, the expense ratio of an index fund should be very low--that's one of the main reasons for investing in a fund of this type. Yet a glance at many index funds indicates that these ratios do vary.<P>


Why the differences? Part of this is due variations in fund size. Economies of scale are very important to index funds, and in general, the larger the fund, the lower the expense ratio. In addition, the size of the management fees vary. <P>


Competition among the index funds has caused many expense ratios to drop. Some of these funds are doing this by waiving part or all of the management fees and administrative expenses. If you invest in a fund that keeps its expenses low by waiving fees, it is important to keep a close eye on the waiver renewals--they are spelled out in the prospectus of the fund, and in the footnotes to the fund's annual report.<P>


Expense ratios can also be lowered by imposing other fees on shareholders that go directly to the fund, for example, a redemption fee for sales within the first six months. These fees are also designed to discourage continuous trading of fund shares, which increases transaction costs within the fund.<P>


It is important to consider how other fees and charges may apply to you. If you intend to remain invested in a fund longer than six months, the redemption fees may be of little concern, but if you want to switch frequently, they should be avoided. If you plan to invest only a small amount in an index fund, you should take into consideration the impact of any annual maintenance fees.<P>


One final item investors may want to consider is investor switching. Long-term investors may be better off with a fund that takes steps to discourage frequent switching, which can raise transaction costs and expense ratios, since the fund must sell shares to raise cash and to rebalance the fund to reflect the index. Some funds can lessen this impact by using stock index futures.<P>


To discourage switching, some funds charge fees for telephone exchanges; other funds do not allow telephone exchanges, and still others impose redemption fees that disappear after six months. Market timers, of course, would want to avoid these funds.<P>


Despite the many choices of index funds, there are clear differences. When choosing among the various funds, consider the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Make sure you know which index you want to track.<P>


<LI>Check the expense ratio of the fund--it should be below 0.50%.<P>


<LI>Check to see if the expense ratio is low due to fee waivers, and if so, see when those waivers are due to expire.<P>


<LI>Check for any other fees or charges that may affect your planned investment.<P>


<LI>If you are a long-term stock market investor, see if the fund discourages short-term switching. This may benefit you in the long run by holding down fund expenses.<P>


<LI>If you want to engage in market timing, which is not recommended, make sure the fund allows telephone exchanges at no charge and with no limitations.<P>


<LI>Check the portfolio turnover rate to make sure the fund's transaction costs are held down.<P>
</UL>

An examination of these characteristics should help you narrow down the list of index funds and help you pick the fund that best suits your needs.<P>
