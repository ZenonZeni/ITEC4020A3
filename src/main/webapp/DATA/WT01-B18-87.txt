<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Getting a Second Opinion:</H1>



<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Why a Second Opinion is Necessary</H2>



<HR SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>



<H4>A Physician Can't Be Up-to-Date on Every Development.</H4>



<P>Medicine is very much a high-technology field.  As with any high-tech field, evolutionary and revolutionary <STRONG>developments are constantly surfacing.</STRONG>  It is not fair to expect any practitioner to be up to date on every current development.</P>



<P>A doctor who is busy practicing medicine just doesn't have time to closely watch the ever changing field of medical research on behalf of every patient.  An article in the March 1992 issue of <I>Consumer Reports</I> cites a study by sociologist David Phillips of the University of California at San Diego that found <STRONG>most physicians initially get their information on new medical developments from the newspaper.</STRONG>  Only a few developments make it into the daily paper right away; many never do at all.</P>



<P><STRONG>It is quite possible that there is a better treatment available or in development about which your doctor simply does not know.</STRONG>  One possible way to find out if this is so in your case is simply to go to another doctor.</P>



<HR SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>



<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Where to Get Your Second Opinion</H2>



<HR SIZE=6 WIDTH=75%>



<P>The <A HREF="http://www.nci.nih.gov">National Cancer Institute</A> is the federal organization charged with the responsibility of coordinating government efforts toward fighting cancer.  With its nearly two billion dollar annual budget, the NCI sponsors research and clinical trials, collects and distributes cancer information, and sponsors other programs and activities to battle cancer.  Much of the research sponsored is carried out by other public and private organizations but with financial help from the NCI.</P>



<P>The NCI has designated twenty-eight hospitals and clinics as comprehensive cancer centers and thirteen as clinical cancer centers.  These centers have been recognized for their excellence in cancer treatment by the NCI.</P>



<P><STRONG>To be designated as a comprehensive cancer center, an institution must meet the following criteria:</STRONG></P>



<UL TYPE=SQUARE>

	<LI>must pass rigorous peer review

	<LI>must have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields

	<LI>must have a record of innovative clinical research studies

	<LI>must have a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice

	<LI>must maintain strong participation in NCI designated high-priority clinical trials

	<LI>must maintain significant levels of cancer prevention and control research

	<LI>must initiate outreach and educational activities

	<LI>must maintain cancer information services for patients and health professionals

</UL>



<P>The clinical cancer centers focus on both basic research and clinical research within each institution.  They frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs.</P>



<P><STRONG>If you possibly can, get a second opinion from a designated comprehensive cancer center.</STRONG>  Failing that, a clinical cancer center would also be a good bet for a state of the art second opinion.  The designated centers are required to keep up to date on the latest information about cancer and to participate in cancer research and clinical trials.</P>



<P>Also, their staffs include research physicians as well as full time practitioners.  Research physicians tend to be up on the latest developments and the pros and cons of different treatment alternatives.  Also, <STRONG>researchers at NCI-designated facilities are more likely to seek out the latest information on a particular illness because they see that as part of their professional responsibility.  Practitioners, on the other hand, may tend to put a lower priority on keeping current with the latest research developments.</STRONG></P>



<P>Finally, it is important to note that there are many other excellent cancer treatment facilities that do not have the NCI recognition as either a comprehensive or clinical cancer center.  Other groups offer their own lists of quality cancer treatment institutions.  For example, a magazine for cancer survivors and patients called <I>Coping,</I> publishes an annual listing of what it considers to be the top one hundred institutions for cancer treatment in this country.</P>
