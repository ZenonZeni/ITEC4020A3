		<P>
				Municipal bonds are debt securities issued by state and
				local governments, their agencies and enterprises with a
				public purpose. The agencies include authorities for housing,
				toll roads and school districts. Some examples of enterprises
				with a public purpose are hospitals and universities.

		<P>
				The most important feature of municipal bonds is that the interest
				income is exempt from federal income taxes (Alternative Minimum
				Tax (AMT) may apply). Generally, interest income is also exempt
				from state and local taxes if the investor lives in the state
				and county that issued the bond. Consequently, the bond would
				be triple tax exempt. The taxable equivalent yield offered by the 
				municipal bond could exceed the yields available on comparably 
				rated taxable investments.
	
		<P>
				With a multitude of different municipal bond issues outstanding,
				you can select a bond issue that best suits your investment needs. 
				Since municipal bonds are often rated based on the credit worthiness 
				of the issuer, you could select high-quality municipal bonds that could 
				be ranked after <A HREF="bondust.htm">U.S. Treasuries</A> and agencies
				in safety.  In addition, investors can have an additional layer of safety 
				since some municipal bonds have their principal and interest payments 
				guaranteed by an insurance company for timely payment. There is a large 
				secondary market in which you can buy and sell municipal bonds and, 
				depending on the current market rates, you could receive more or less than 
				par value if you sell the bond before maturity.

		<P>
				The equivalent yield of a taxable bond at the investor's tax bracket
				is the yield an investor would have to earn to equal the yield
				on a tax-free (municipal) bond.
