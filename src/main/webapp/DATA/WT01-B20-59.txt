<p align="center">... a weekly service for the media on news
items related to Marijuana Prohibition. </p>

<p align="center">March 30, 1995</p>

<p align="center"><b>Editor of Arkansas Times Comes out of Her
&quot;Smoky Little Closet&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Writing in her regular column, Mara Leveritt, the senior
editor of the widely respected weekly <i>Arkansas Times</i>
revealed that she has smoked an average of one &quot;joint&quot;
per day for the last twenty years.&nbsp; Leveritt, who was named
Arkansas Journalist of Year by the University of Arkansas explained
that her purpose was not to encourage the use of marijuana, but
to spur a more rational discussion of marijuana
prohibition.&nbsp; By speaking out she hopes to make it more
difficult to demonize marijuana users. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">She said that &quot;we have come to accept as normal a most
dangerous form of political correctness: a situation in which
those on one side of the issue feel safe to speak, while any would-be
opposition exposes itself to heightened scrutiny.&quot;&nbsp; She
went on to say that &quot;If long term, regular users like myself
felt free to articulate their experiences with marijuana, the
walking, talking evidence that we represent would put our
marijuana laws to shame....&nbsp; And as we get older, our lives
begin to make the lies that have been broadcast about marijuana
look even more ridiculous.&quot; </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the Associated Press story on the article, Leveritt
acknowledged having belonged to NORML. NORML salutes her courage
and urges others who talk about the truth to stop living a lie.&nbsp;
Speaking the truth is a wonderfully liberating experience.&nbsp;
We have it on the highest authority that it will make us free. </p>

<p align="center">[Ms. Leveritt can be reached at 501-375-2985.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Alleged white House Shootist Reportedly
Smoked Pot and Listened to Rush Limbaugh<br>
A Dangerous Combination?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to the testimony of a friend, Francisco Duran, who
is accused of spraying the White House with bullets, allegedly
smoked marijuana and listened to Rush Limbaugh before setting out for
Washington.&nbsp; His friend who smoked marijuana with him, but
did not listen to Rush Limbaugh, said he tried to talk him out of
his plan to attack the President.&nbsp; Since marijuana -- unlike
alcohol -- is not conimonly associated with acts of violence,
marijuana users who listen to Rush Limbaugh are urged to watch
out for violent impulses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>New Test Allows Parents to Test Their
Children's Rooms for &quot;Drugs&quot;</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In a major breakthrough in the technology of cementing family
values Barrington Technologies of New Providence, New Jersey, has
introduced a home drug detection kit, &quot;DrugAlert,&quot; that allows
parents to surreptitiously check their children's room and
personal belongings for drug residues. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">A March 29 <i>Washington Post</i> story on the test quoted a
staff therapist at the Family Therapy Institute of Alexandria,
Virginia, saying that &quot;It usually takes two or three years
after a child is using before their behavior becomes so deviant
that parents are aware of their drug use, and by that time they
are well into addiction.&quot;&nbsp; He did not suggest at what
age parents might start using these tests, but presumably it
should be up to three years before there is any indication of a
problem.&nbsp; According to the Partnership for a Drug-Free (sic)
America, the median age of first drug use by children is 12 and
half.&nbsp; Therefore regular testing might begin at age 9.&nbsp;
The <i>Washington Post</i> story also reported on home urine
tests that are being sold.&nbsp; Parents can also collect their
children's urine samples from an early age.&nbsp; There are
conflicting opinions on the relative merits of surreptitious and
forced testing as tools to help the child mature in a drug-free
environment. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The DrugAlert kit supplies a small pre-moistened pad which
picks up drug residues when wiped across items that may have come
into contact with illicit drugs.&nbsp; To demonstrate the technology,
company executives spread cocaine over common objects - such as a
baseball trophy which one would expect a drug using child to
bring into contact with drugs.&nbsp; The surfaces were then wiped
with the DrugAlert pad and the pad was tested and demonstrated
the presence of the cocaine.&nbsp; It was not explained <i>where</i>
the company got the cocaine, whether from the DEA, the CIA, or
the Iran/Contra connection. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The company warns that children might pick up drug residues
without actually using drugs, and a company executive also
admitted that the company had not considered the possibility that children
might use the test to check their parents rooms for drugs.&nbsp; <u>Perhaps
the D.A.R.E. program could provide children with the tests so
that more parents could be reported to the police and thereby
saved from drugs</u>.&nbsp; Employers [such as editors or
producers -ed.] might test their employees' personal belongings
to detect drug traces.&nbsp; Presumably the tests will not detect
the residues of alcoholic beverages so that teenage binge
drinking will not be detected and personal liberty will not be
undermined. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Marijuana Plants Thrive In Downtown Tel Aviv<br>
Is Marijuana Decriminalization Coming To Isreal?</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 24, The <em>Jerusalem Post</em> (JP) ran an article
featuring the actions of the country's most evident marijuana
reform organization, The Green Revolution. </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * Israel has a growing marijuana-smoking population and many
    of them believe that the drug, being natural rather than
    chemical, should be legalized. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Recently, the drive towards legalized growing and smoking of
cannabis gained new momemtum.&nbsp; While the legalization
movement has been going on here for some time, the movement in
Tel Aviv has exploded.&nbsp; Over the past year, there have been
rallies and smoke-ins at Tel Aviv nightclubs, and organizers have
produced T-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons and pamphlets carrying
the familiar shape of the cannabis leaf. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">But buttons and signs aren't enought to bring about such a
radical change.&nbsp; [Marijuana reform group] The Green
Revolution has discovered the green thumb.&nbsp; Armed with
seedlings and a smile, about 15 revolutionaries have turned to
gardening.&nbsp; Their mission: to turn Tel Aviv into a marijuana jungle. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">On one Friday afternoon in January, members of the group targeted
the Tel Aviv landscape, tilling the soil with about 1,000
seeds.&nbsp; The result: marijuana is growing all over downtown
Tel Aviv. 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * [The JP further reports] After the Green Revolution made
    its strategy public, hundreds of others planted seeds, and
    not just in Tel Aviv.&nbsp; Sprouts have been spotted in Or
    Yehuda and Givatayim.&nbsp; Budding cannabis has been spotted
    around Tel Aviv City Hall, in the planters of Carlebach Steet
    office buildings and down other main streets. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * [But, there are detractors. -ed.] Dr. Benny Avrahami,
    director of the Tel Aviv Municipal Anti-Drug Authority. He
    admits that marijuana is hardly in the same league as hard
    drugs...though he considers marijuana to be the
    &quot;gate-opener&quot; to harder drugs. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * Avrahami thinks that legalizing marijuana could lead to the
    collapse of Isreali society. 
</blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;<i><u>If marijuana was to become legalized, in my opinion,
it would be social suicide for Isreal</u></i> [emphasis added
-ed.].&nbsp; So many of our youth would feel free to use it and
the more users, the more addicts.&nbsp; How can we afford to have
this when they are in the army and part of a society that may be
called up at a short notice to serve?&quot; 

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    * One month after the fast seeds were planted, the group set
    out to see what had become of their gardening
    adventure.&nbsp; The payoff: 5-cm.-high marijuana plants around
    downtown... [Green Revolution members] will continue their
    fight for legalization, planting and campaigning, because
    they really want to be law-abiding citizens.&nbsp; But until
    that happens-- they'll just keep breaking the law. 
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><b><u>REMINDER</u></b><b>: ABC News Special To Focus On
    The 'War On Drugs'</b> <br>
    ABC News will air a special program. &quot;America's War On
    Drugs: Searching For Solutions&quot;, on Thursday, April 6,
    1995, 10:00 - 11:00 PM, ET.&nbsp; NORML members from
