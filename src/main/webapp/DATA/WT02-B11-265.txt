<H2><A NAME="review">Review of happenings</A></H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT> 1890
<DE> Brandeis' famous article on right to privacy.
<DT> 1928
<DE> Supreme Court decided whether the 4th Amendment to the Constitution did not restrict interception of telephone communication. Brandeis dissented.
<DT> 1934
<DE> Congress passed Communications Act, which included the provision that "no person not being authorized by sender shall intercept any communications and divulge ... the contents."
<DT> 1938
<DE> Supreme Court construed Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit all telephone wiretapping.  Justice Dept disagreed - saying it didn't apply to federal agents. President issued executive order allowing wiretapping for "national security purposes." Wiretapping continued.
<DT> 1967
<DE> Katz vs. US - Supreme Court reversed 1928 decision.
<DT> 1968
<DE> Congress enacts legislation that permits surveillance provided agents "minimized" data collected.  Communication service providers were duty bound to assist agents but were not obliged to make their technology pre-equipped with trap-doors.
<DT> 1978
<DE> Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  For the first time, standards for foreign espoinage were put down on paper.
<DT> 1986
<DE> Wiretap Law extended to new forms of communication.
<DT> 1987
<DE> Computer Security Act gave NIST control over crypto-standards for unclassified government and commercial sectors.  Memorandum of Understanding between NSA and NIST gave NSA de-facto control over NIST for crypto-standards.  Result - all govt. agencies have to use whatever standard the NSA chose.
<DT> 1991
<DE> Senate Bill 266.  Comprehensive Anti-terrorism Act.  Sought wide powers for conducting wiretaps.
</DL>
<UL>
<L1> The evolution of the law over time is very representative of the duality in the American legal system.  Laws are passed by congress, executive orders are passed by the government, and laws are interpreted by the judiciary.
<L1> The 1st and 4th Amendments form the constitutional basis for the protection of privacy.
<L1> (Note: Marc Rotenberg's article in C-ACM, August 93, is a good reference for a quick overview of some of the events described here.  Some of the other facts were gleaned from a number of different sources.)

<LI> Issue to think about: which are greater - risks to safety or risks to liberty?  How much can we trust the govt?  How much privacy is there anyway? Is our perception of how much privacy we actually have just an illusion?

<H2><A NAME="proposal">Proposal for Authorization Procedures  (As of Sep 93)</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI> In mid-Feb Clipper was introduced as a FIPS.
<LI> Clipper would be installed on a device known as a Tessera Card.
Tesserea (pl. Tessereae): Identity chit or marker ... forced on conquered people and slaves by their Roman conquerors or owners.  Slaves or Gauls who refused...were branded or maimed as a form of identification.
<LI> Black Box (PC) reads Law Enforcement Access Field in Clipper encrypted data stream.
<LI> Black Boxes - all unique with own id no, owned exclusively by various law enforcement agencies.
<LI> Agent faxes LEAF, black box id no, authorization and time period.
<LI> Each escrow agent makes note in log, transmits key components directly.  Supposed to last only as long as time period authorized and supposed to be only for that black box.

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="loopholes">Loopholes in the procedure</A></H2>

<UL>
<LI> No substantive rights for intercepted party if the agents do not follow procedure
<LI> NSA doesn't need court order.
<LI> mention no right to encryption software - in Feb 4 briefings - US citizens were not guaranteed the right to choose their own encryption technologies.
<LI> Choice of Escrow Agents: are both from the executive branch. NIST (Dept. of Commerce) &amp; Treasury Dept.
<LI> Official reason - choose agency that has experience dealing with sensitive data.
<LI> Gore reaction - early Feb 94 - "inadequate controls," "I raised hell about that." - branch of judiciary might be better.
<LI> Escrow agents cannot prevent misuse because they do not see any details about the intercepted party other than LEAF.
</UL>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="official">Official Reasons for introducing the regulations</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI> DES is on its death bed.

<LI> Unclassified govt. data can be very sensitive - needs strong protection.

<LI> US business interests abroad need to be protected from spying (this is one area that is actually part of the NSA's job).

<LI> Since the NSA had the skipjack algorithm, which in its view was definitely far better than DES, it would be a good idea to share it with the public.

<LI> The introduction of this new technology should not exclude licit law enforcement access.

<LI> (A little out of context) The average cost of a wiretap is $45000, clipper would provide a much easier and cheaper wiretap (Dr. Denning) 

<LI> Criminals are careless and forgetful.  After Clipper becomes the standard, they will forget about it and use Clipper encrypted communications.

<LI> Safe system - cannot get out of hand because of Congressional review, judiciary and public involvement.  If it does, just destroy the keys. (Dr. Denning)

<H2><A NAME="real">Real Reasons for introducing the regulations</A></H2>
<UL>

<LI> Competitive Intelligence.

<LI> NSA wants pride, power and budget of Cold War era?

<LI> NSC has wanted to increase surveillance abilities all along. So in this case Clipper did not arise out of a need to improve encryption protection available to citizens.  Rather, Clipper is just a way of increasing wiretapping abilities.  Previously had tried to use - Commercial COMSEC endorsement program (CCEP) - vendors would be required to join the program and would be authorized to incorporate classified algorithms into their communications systems.
<LI> Under CCEP (which failed pass through Congress), the NSA could have done as they pleased with the keys.  However, the program failed because of the great burden it would have placed on the telephone companies to modify their existing systems, without any form of subsidy.
<LI> Some quotes:  for example, in an article in the WSJ - March 28, 1988: "Technically, if someone bought out device and we made the keys and made a copy sure we could listen in. But we have better things to do with our time."

<LI> Listening in on the American public?

<LI> Listening in on governemnt employees - prevent embarrassing leaks? 

<LI> National Information Infrastructure - NSA wants it to be front-loaded with surveillance doors?

<LI> Legitimate concerns about terrorists and criminals.  Perhaps, the NSA really believes that the Clipper/Capstone/Tessera program will work without even considering the costs.  Some naivete on part of the NSA?

<H2><A NAME="procedures">Authorization Procedures For Release Of Encryption Key Components In Conjunction With Intercepts Pursuant To Title III</A></H2>

The following are the procedures for the release of escrowed key components in conjunction with lawfully authorized interception of communications encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method. These procedures cover all electronic surveillance conducted pursuant to Title III of the omnibus Crime Control 

<OL>
<LI> In each case there shall be a legal authorization for the interception of wire and/or electronic communications. <p>

<LI> All electronic surveillance court orders under Title III shall contain provisions authorizing after-the-act minimization, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2518(5), permitting the interception and retention of coded communications, including encrypted communications. <p>

<LI> In the event that federal law enforcement agents discover during the course of any lawfully authorized interception that communications encrypted with a key escrow encryption method are being utilized, they  may obtain a certification from the investigative agency conducting the investigation, or the Attorney General of the United States or designee thereof. Such certification shall
<OL>
<LI> identify the law enforcement agency or other authority conducting the interception and the person providing the certification;
<LI> certify that necessary legal authorization has been obtained to conduct electronic surveillance regarding these communications;
<LI> specify the termination date of the period for which interception has been authorized;
<LI> identify by docket number or other suitable method of specification the source of the authorization;

<LI> certify that communications covered by that authorization are being encrypted with a key-escrow encryption method;

<LI> specify the identifier (ID) number of the key escrow encryption chip providing such encryption; and

<LI> specify the serial (ID) number of the key-escrow decryption device that will be used by the law enforcement agency or other authority for decryption of the intercepted communications.
</OL> <P>

<LI> The agency conducting the interception shall submit this certification to each of the designated key component escrow agents. If the certification has been provided by an investigative agency, as soon thereafter as practicable, an attorney associated with the United States Attorney's Office supervisi


<LI> Upon receiving the certification from the requesting investigative agency, each key component escrow agent shall release the necessary key component to the requesting agency. The key components shall be provided in a manner that assures they cannot be used other than in conjunction with the lawfully authorized electronic surveillance for which they were requested. <p>

<LI> Each of the key component escrow agents shall retain a copy of the certification of the requesting agency, as well as the subsequent confirmation of the United States Attorney's office. In addition, the requesting agency shall retain a copy of the certification and provide copies to the following: <p>

<UL>
<LI> the United States Attorney's office supervising the investigation, and
<LI> the Department of Justice, Office of Enforcement operations.
</UL> <P>

<LI> Upon, or prior to, completion of the electronic surveillance phase of the investigation, the ability of the requesting agency to decrypt intercepted communications shall terminate, and the requesting agency may not retain the key components. <p>

<LI> These procedures do not create, and are not intended to create, any substantive rights for individuals intercepted through electronic surveillance, and noncompliance with these procedures shall not provide the basis for any motion to suppress or other objection to the introduction of electronic surve
