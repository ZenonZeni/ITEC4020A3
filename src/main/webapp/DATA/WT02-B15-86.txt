        Record System?</h2>
        <p><i>DIR takes Interest in Computerized Records' Risk
        Management Potential</i></p>
        <p align="center"><i>By Mary Anne Clause, Senior Risk
        Management Consultant</i></p>
        <p>If you are not yet comfortable with the concept of
        electronic medical records (EMR), you're not alone. This
        article is designed to help those readers who are not
        already computer buffs become familiar with the basics of
        this technology. DIR supports the use of EMR systems
        because of the many features available to streamline,
        standardize, and safeguard care decisions and
        recordkeeping. We are pleased to announce that DIR's
        Board of Directors has approved a 10% premium discount
        for physicians that use EMR systems with recommended risk
        management applications. </p>
        <p><b>CHALLENGES</b><br>
        EMR systems are not without potential problems. Usual
        fears center around &quot;downtime&quot; or computer
        &quot;crashes&quot; and loss of data. These fears are not
        as realistic as they were several years ago. The
        reliability of both hardware and software is much
        improved. Another concern is the need to maintain hard
        files for incoming reports, signed consents, etc. Some
        offices scan documents into the electronic file and
        others that are networked to hospitals, labs, pharmacies,
        etc. have data transmitted directly into the EMR. </p>
        <p><b>SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</b><br>
        Electronic records are becoming a necessity as the demand
        for information grows. Computer networks that allow
        physicians, hospitals, payors, and other support services
        to interface, promote rapid access to the patient's
        record and facilitate close collaboration among
        caregivers. However, an increased ability to share
        records creates an increased risk of unauthorized
        disclosure. Laws formed on a state level that govern the
        use of medical information, are often considered
        inconsistent, conflicting, and unclear. Few states have
        addressed the use of electronic records. To make matters
        worse, large data networks can transmit information
        across state lines in a flash. Several attempts have been
        made to propose federal privacy legislation, including
        the Fair Health Information Practices Act of 1995, the
        Medical Records Confidentiality Act, and the Medical
        Privacy in the Age of New Technologies Act of 1996. None
        of these have passed through committee. State
        legislatures are showing interest and concern. In 1994
        VA. CODE 54.1-2403.2 was enacted by Virginia's General
        Assembly giving legal protection to medical records of
        health care providers that are stored by computerized or
        other electronic processes or microfilm. This statute
        requires that the record identify the location of
        documents or other information that cannot be
        technologically stored. It also states that if the
        technological storage process creates an unalterable
        record, the health care provider shall not be required to
        maintain paper copies of the records stored
        electronically. Security safeguards are available in many
        EMR systems on the market. They include many of the
        required elements listed in the DIR premium discount
        program at the conclusion of this article. </p>
        <p><b>WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?</b><br>
        The potential for EMR systems is limitless. The wave of
        the future is here for some systems linked by network
        where: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>prenatal documentation flow sheets and obstetric
                records are accessed from delivery and labor
                rooms; </li>
            <li>lab work and x-rays are ordered by computer and
                results directly down-loaded into the physician's
                system; </li>
            <li>admission information is transmitted from office
                to hospital; </li>
            <li>physicians access current medical literature or
                practice guidelines on their own systems; and </li>
            <li>physicians' computer screens are flagged when a
                patient fails to pick up an ordered drug or
                report for a scheduled test. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Networks built to acceptable standards will facilitate
        the flow of information necessary to generate reliable
        outcomes. Hospitals, managed care organizations, and
        networked systems with an interest in outcomes research
        may eventually require the use of EMR systems. Insurers
        will evaluate a practice's quality of care by efficiency
        and outcomes data, and patient satisfaction survey
        results. </p>
        <p><b>TIPS WHEN CHOOSING A SYSTEM</b><br>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set goals and objectives before searching for an
                EMR system. </li>
            <li>Develop a list of vendors who have longevity in
                the business and maintain good reputations for
                service and updates. </li>
            <li>Send a request for all product information, a
                demonstration disk (usually free), and
                information on any special needs. </li>
            <li>Develop questions for selected vendors that
                reflect your needs. Request a proposal, including
                costs. Set a deadline. </li>
            <li>Compare responses and arrange for an in-office
                demonstration with on-hands practice. Encourage
                physician involvement. </li>
            <li>Establish compatibility of hardware and software
                with other software, to allow for flexibility and
                eventual expansion. </li>
            <li>Ensure that your final choice is a system that is
                easy to use, has excellent vendor training,
                support and maintenance, and meets the goals and
                objectives of your particular practice. </li>
            <li>Ensure that your final choice is a system that is
                easy to use, has excellent vendor support and
                maintenance, and is technologically capable of
                meeting the required risk management elements in
                DIR's premium discount program. </li>

        <p><b>ITS UP TO YOU</b><br>
        Whether you feel electronic medical records are worth the
        trouble and expense or not, in the long run they appear
        to be inevitable. Cost efficiency research is in its
        infancy, but initial results are promising. Technology in
        this field is changing rapidly. This article reviews only
        a minimum of basic issues surrounding EMR systems, so
        individual investigation is highly recommended. This is
        not an easy decision. Certainly, there are risks
        associated with moving forward as well as waiting too
        long. However, most sources point to a competitive
        advantage, through market differentiation as well as
        experience gained in using this technology, for those who
        choose EMR. </p>
