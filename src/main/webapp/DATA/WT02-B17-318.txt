<P>This is a display over several days in perhaps a shopping center to show the work of local organizations, and government, with people from those organizations on hand to talk to the public, answer questions, and give out leaflets. Visits from local celebrities, dignitaries or national figures, plus banners, photographers, local broadcasts, and surveys involving public participation all add to the attractions.

<P><STRONG>Useful tips:</STRONG>

<P>Be an extrovert. Think about getting balloons and stick-on badges to give away. Arrange for visitors (local personalities) who will get publicity. Make sure the display space is well identified. A banner across the front tends to get hidden unless it is above people’s heads. You may need to find and fix vertical supports to raise your flag. Or give staffers eye-catching sashes, rosettes or hats. Use strong color and design.
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Have lots of people working at the exhibition so that visitors can be helped as quickly as possible. 
<LI>Get a local radio personality to do a broadcast from the exhibition. 
<LI>Decide in advance what to do if the weather is awful. Have an alternative site or day planned. Make sure it is publicized. 
<LI>Have rubber bands or paperweights available to hold down leaflets. 
<LI>Share costs of rent (if necessary) and insurance among participating organizations. 
<LI>Find volunteers for erecting and dismantling exhibition material.
<LI>An on-site telephone is invaluable. 
<LI>Provide chairs for staff. 
<LI>Try to advertise on-site before you open. 
<LI>Use the opportunity of meeting the public to conduct a simple but substantive survey.
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Checklist</STRONG>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Book space and check conditions of renting and security. 
<LI>Invite special visitors. 
<LI>Find display boards and furniture. 
<LI>Arrange moving, erecting and dismantling of exhibit. 
<LI>Agree on layout. 
<LI>Book other events. 
<LI>Get banner. 
<LI>Arrange schedule of volunteers. 
<LI>Tell the media.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Timing</STRONG>

<P>Reserve space and plan supporting events early. Start thinking about any special surveys in ample time. Get leaflets as early as possible. Arrange volunteers’ schedules about a month beforehand. See Publicity section (Page 9). Start your search for display boards early. Spend time discussing the exhibit layout with all the organizations that will be participating.

<P>This is a display of posters and leaflets illustrating the work of national and local organizations with an interest in energy, in a library, shopping center or elsewhere which can be left up for a period of time and which does not need constant staff attention.

<P><STRONG>Useful Tips</STRONG>
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Reserve space early. Display space is often at a premium. 
<LI>If no single display space is available, consider smaller displays in shop windows or empty shop premises. 
<LI>Make sure organizations providing display material know who is responsible for transporting, putting up and dismantling, and who will pay. 
<LI>Some organizations have a minimum display period for lending their displays (to justify the cost of setting up and taking down). Find out if your display can continue when your main event is over. 
<LI>Replenish leaflet supplies during the event. 
<LI>Allow time to set up and dismantle (a day before and after display time). 
<LI>Walk through the public areas on the way to your exhibition and post signs at key points. 
<LI>Make sure your display can be secured when not in use. Your information is valuable and every effort should be made to protect it.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Checklist:</STRONG>

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Reserve space and confirm dates early.

<LI>Arrange special visitors if needed. 
<LI>Tell the media. 
<LI>If the library or shopping center produces its own publicity, check the details with them so that they describe your exhibition as you would like.

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>A public meeting to give an opportunity to publicize the existence of government agencies and various organizations and groups interested in energy issues?

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Involve agencies and organizations from the start and discuss with the chief officer the kind of meeting the members would like. 
<LI>Allow plenty of time for them to circulate invitations to their members. 
<LI>Make positive efforts to get an audience if it is to be a public meeting; contact other organizations in good time; make personal contact with them to explain what you are doing. 
<LI>Inspect the meeting room; make sure there are enough chairs, a speaker’s lectern or platform and a sound system. 
<LI>Make sure the meeting room is well identified. 
<LI>Even modest refreshments help people relax and get to know each other.

<P>This project uses a large room where each agency or organization has its own consulting section, with table and chairs. An alternative would be to use one room which is shared on a rotating basis among the organizations over a period of time.

<P>Most elected representatives attend local meetings to keep in touch with their constituents. An alternative idea would be to arrange a specific energy issue session linked to one of the general energy meetings.

<P><STRONG>Useful Tips</STRONG>

<P>A specific issue session is probably not worth planning unless the site is very accessible to the general public and well identified. People need to get to the site easily.

<P>A shopping center meeting room might be set aside, on a rotating basis, for issue sessions. If it can be repeated at a later date, or become part of the center’s regular schedule, you will have established a new specialized advice service to the general public.

<P>Massive amounts of publicity are necessary. Remember that most people usually do not have energy problems or questions at any single particular time. As a result, the number of times your issue session will coincide with people having problems or questions you can help solve or answer will be fairly small. Nevertheless, a session can still be useful.

<P><STRONG>Checklist</STRONG>

<P>Consider planning public meetings during Energy Awareness Month with other local or national organizations on particular subjects (energy conservation/do-it-yourself residential remodeling; appliance labeling and efficiency; future energy supply, etc.).

<P>An alternative would be to find a speaker, or gather a number of speakers from various organizations involved in your event, and offer them to other local organizations to speak at regular meetings. Since some organizations plan their programs six months or a year in advance, it is probably more effective to publicize your speakers panel during Energy Awareness Month with the hope that appearances can be lined up for your speakers during the coming year.

<P><STRONG>Useful Tips</STRONG>
<P>Public meetings usually are not well attended. Any more than 20 is considered good. Try to get a captive audience. For example, if the meeting is to be at a college, ask the president, dean and responsible faculty members to publicize it, or let you publicize it, among the students. If you are co-sponsoring the event with other organizations, make sure they know it is their responsibility as well to generate an audience from their membership.

<P>Car care is a popular topic and one that is likely to interest your audience. You might organize a car care fair to help educate motorists about vehicle maintenance. The fair could be held over a weekend, with various exhibits and local experts to answer questions. Or a week-long event could be planned, with a different clinic each night on a specific topic.

<P>You should be able to enlist the aid of reputable local experts such as mechanics, auto supply dealers, auto clubs and car dealers, since the event will provide good publicity for their businesses. In addition to knowing about car care, these people will probably know useful information about recent recalls of certain models, or refunds offered by auto manufacturers for specific repairs on certain categories of cars. Don’t forget to invite experts who can discuss alternatively fueled cars and new automotive technologies that promise more efficient transportation.CAR CARE EVENTS

<P>There are several projects you could help plan with schools, such as a special energy contest (quiz, designing an energy poster, or energy stamp) or a special film for video tape showing. Many government agencies, corporations, trade associations and non-profit organizations have materials available. A good speaker is needed to introduce the films and tapes, and, if necessary, answer questions. You could put together an energy education kit, or an energy teaching kit for an adult literacy class. For example, materials distributed by the local electric utility company (meter reading cards, disconnection notices, energy efficiency tips, leaflets) can be the basis for literacy teaching.

<LI>There is so much you could do, it could take a whole week in itself. You need the active cooperation of educators if it is to succeed. 
<LI>Get an inside contact and talk with school administrators and/or teacher organizations before you decide to proceed. 
<LI>The awarding of prizes can be a separate event with its own publicity.
<LI>News media love children, so use them in the publicity. They are the energy users of tomorrow.

<P>A newspaper supplement or pamphlet is a permanent memento of your energy event. It provides key information about the event and your group. The supplement, of course, is distributed as part of your local newspaper, while the pamphlet would be distributed in quantity to the public. Most groups planning an energy event want to produce a supplement or pamphlet.

<LI>Program for the day, week, month. 
<LI>Details about local energy organizations, with addresses, hours of operation and brief outline of what they do. (Example: people won’t automatically know what a utility consumer board is and does.)

<P><STRONG>Useful Tips</STRONG>
<P>It takes time to write copy and get approval of the final draft from everyone involved. You will want photographs or other art work which need to be prepared well in advance.
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Newspaper Supplement. One full page or several tabloid pages in a local newspaper with a high circulation can cost a lot of money. Try to sell other organizations on taking advertising space on your page or in the supplement to help pay for it.
<LI>Consumer Information Pamphlet. Again, bulk printing of a leaflet can be expensive. Get estimates from local printers well in advance. Think carefully about the message that is important to the public and how you will distribute the pamphlet (at the exhibit, local libraries, etc.) before you begin production.
</UL>

<P><STRONG>Checklist</STRONG>
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Confirm titles, addresses, and telephone numbers with organizations appearing in supplement or pamphlet and a simple description of what they do. Have names, addresses, and telephone numbers checked by someone who is not familiar with them.
<LI>Collect interesting stories and make contacts for newspapers to interview to provide editorial copy for the supplement.

<P>Although not an essential part of the week, a social event for the organizers is a bonus and gives cohesion to the group that has come together to plan it. You could make it part of one of your events such as the meeting of energy representatives, or it could be a special event, perhaps at the end of the week when everyone could relax and thank-yous could be made (with special recognition given to the workers and organizers). But remember, this too will need organizing and invitations must be sent.
