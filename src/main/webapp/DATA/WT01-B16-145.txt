Coordinate Robots</b></font></p>

<p>CCRs are highly configurable, rectilinear robot systems which,
in a basic configuration, include an X and Y axis. Three axis
CCRs, incorporating an X, Y, and Z axis, are also common for
positioning tools, such as dispensers, cutters, drivers, and
routers. Each of the axis lengths are selectable, with the
ability to attach different types of Z-heads. Payloads and speeds
vary based on axis length and support structures. CCRs are also
typically very repeatable, have better inherent accuracy than a
SCARA or jointed arm, and perform 3D path-dependent motions with
relative ease. However, the CCR&#146;s key feature is its
configurability &#150; the ability you have to configure and size
the CCR to best meet your application needs. </p>

<p>Best of all, you pay only for the axes you really need! If two
axes are required, you buy a 2-axis CCR and save. If three axes,
you buy a 3-axis CCR. If four axes are needed, you have the
choice of using a SCARA or a CCR system, which ever best meets
your application needs. If odd configurations are required, then
the flexibility of CCR systems gives you many more possibilities
to consider.</p>

<p><font color="#0000FF">The Sankyo CCR-M Series - Configured
CCRs Ready to Go!</font></p>

<p>In today&#146;s competitive world, you don&#146;t have the
time or the staff to worry about attaching a Z axis to a Y axis
to an X axis, routing your cables in a reliable manner, finding
cable tracks and supports, or ensuring that your newly assembled
system is safe to use. If you want to be productive on the job,
if you want solutions with reliable designs, if you want to be
able &quot;plug and go&quot; to better meet those critical dates,
then what you need are Sankyo Cartesian Coordinate Robot Systems,
each already configured to your specification, each UL approved,
and each ready to be integrated into your application, right out
of the crate.</p>

<p>Sankyo&#146;s Configured CCRs, the CCR-M Series, have already
been proven in hundreds of installations and have many exciting
and useful features to make your job easier, your schedules
shorter, and your production better. </p>

<ul>
    <li>The CCR-M robots incorporate a modern industrial design
        and are delivered assembled and tested with integrated,
        well-managed cabling. You simply plug the CCR system in,
        attach the controller and pendant, and turn it on. Now
        you&#146;re ready to develop the application program and
        keep on schedule.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Large wattage brushless AC servo motors are used for the
        X and Y axes, and each axis utilizes an AC motor with an
        absolute encoder. No homing is required! Motors can be
        mounted in-line to the axis or in a parallel fashion
        (belt-driven) to minimize space requirements.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Each of the linear axes use cold-drawn steel frames with
        integrated double rails, precision ball screws, and
        double blocks on the X and Ys. The Y-axis is attached to
        the X-axis with a machined cast iron bracket. Given the
        opportunity, one can easily feel how solid these systems
        are.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>For the smaller configurations, cantilevered designs are
        very typical. For the configurations with longer Y axes
        or heavier payloads, a rail system is available to
        support the non-powered end of the Y-axis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Many standard configurations are available to include
        X-Y, X-Y-Z, and X-Y-Z-Roll systems. For applications
        requiring the ability to reach into a device, there is an
        X with a reaching Y and an X-Z with a reaching Y.
        Additional configurations and orientations are possible.
        Just let us know what you need.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Five basic head designs, of various sizes, are available
        off the shelf. A simple pneumatic Z, a servo-slide Z, a
        servo-axial Z, a servo-axial Z with a servo-Roll, and a
        standalone servo-Roll. Each can be mounted to almost any
        of the X-Y configurations.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There are two special versions of the CCR-M Series; the
        CCR-M Lite Systems for smaller, lighter payload
        applications, and the CCR-M Long Systems for axis lengths
        exceeding 800 mm. Both add to the variety of solutions
        available from Sankyo.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Motion on all CCR-Ms is fully programmable with flexible
        digital I/O control. There are also 3D linear and
        circular motion for path-dependent applications, built-in
        palletizing commands, and &quot;jump moves&quot; for
        higher speed pick and place.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The CCR-M Series, combined with the SC3000 controller and
        Touch Screen Pendant, are UL and cUL approved, perhaps
        the only CCRs in the industry to be approved. They also
        meet RIA R15.06 and European EN775 Safety Standards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sankyo&#146;s Configured CCRs, the CCR-M Series, offer you
high quality and reliability, in addition to the convenience and
features listed above. Once you have the chance to see a CCR-M
system, to feel its strength, to see it perform, you&#146;ll then
know that the CCR-M Series from Sankyo is for your manufacturing
needs today and into the future&#133;</p>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">General CCR Specifications:</font></h3>

<p>CCR-M specifications are very dependent on the actual
configuration of the system. In general, the key specifications
range as follows:</p>

<pre><font color="#FF0000"><b><tt>Payload </tt></b></font><b><tt>      : from 2 to 25 Kg</tt></b></pre>

<pre><font color="#FF0000"><b><tt>Resolution</tt></b></font><b><tt>    : 0.01 mm per pulse</tt></b></pre>

<pre><font color="#FF0000"><b><tt>Repeatability</tt></b></font><b><tt> : ±0.02 mm per axis</tt></b></pre>

<pre><font color="#FF0000"><b><tt>Speed </tt></b></font><b><tt>        : up to 1400 mm /sec</tt></b><i><tt> </tt></i></pre>
