The department has extensive linkages with the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, and students have access to 
numerous well-equipped laboratories within the institute as well as in the department, such as the Physico Chemical 
Hydrodynamics Laboratory (Prof. C.R. Ethier), and Non-Linear Systems Control (Prof. J.K. Mills).<p>

The mechanism by which the protein channels of 
biological membranes are opened is being studied using 
a new theory of kinetics (Statistical Rate Theory - SRT). 
The mechanism involves the adsorption (binding) of Ca 
ions to the proteins of biological membranes (gating 
currents) and the subsequent generation of an electric 
potential difference across the interfaces of the 
membranes. Under voltage clamp conditions, the gating 
currents as a function of time can be predicted with SRT.<p>
