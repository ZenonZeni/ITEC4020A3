<p><strong>Communists say "The only way to win - vote"</strong></p>

<p><strong>New York</strong> - Gus Hall, National Chairman of the Communist Party USA, outlined
the stakes in the 1996 presidential and congressional elections at a recent
public meeting here. "The outcome of the '96 presidential and congressional
elections will have a most profound impact on U.S. politics, on the people's
overall quality of life and the future direction of our country," Hall said.
Pointing out the dangers if the ultra-right Republicans recapture the
Congress and continue their Contract with America, Hall said, "The election
results can actually mean the difference between life and death for millions.
It will mean the difference between hunger and food stamps, between more
layoffs, joblessness and the Martinez jobs bill (HR1591), between public
education and no education, between union rights and union-busting. Who gets
elected can mean the difference between welfare and immigration laws that are
humane and just, or policies that are anti-people and racist."
In a biting criticism of the media Hall said, "The campaigns and mass media
are out to blur the issues, trivialize them and keep people from discussing,
debating and making the right choices."
</p><p>That is why Hall and the Communist Party USA are urging a massive voter turn
out on November 5. Emphasizing some of the most important arguments for
people to vote, Hall warned that if ultra-right candidates win, the
reactionary and fascist-like corporate sectors will become more aggressive
and emboldened in their attacks on the quality of life and democratic rights
of the people. Struggles will continue after the elections no matter who is
elected, Hall said, but "a Gingrich-led Congress will take no heed of
protests, demonstrations or people's pressure. The base of support for the
right-wingers are the most reactionary, extreme right sectors of monopoly
capital, the ruling class, the wealthy, the religious right and militia
fascist-fringe forces."
</p><p>Playing its part in voter mobilization, the Communist Party has registered
thousands of new voters and distributed hundreds of thousands of election
pamphlets as well as the CPUSA's newspaper the People's Weekly World. </p><p>For
