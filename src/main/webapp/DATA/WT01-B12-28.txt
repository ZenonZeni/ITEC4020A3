 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> CALCIUM </H2>

<P>  As far as sheer quantities are concerned, we probably need more calcium and magnesium than any other vitamin or mineral as they are the primary building blocks of bones, teeth and muscles. Many foods contain these valuable minerals, especially calcium.   Many people supplement their diets with calcium, yet calcium remains high on the list of minerals in which people are deficient.</P>
<P>  What really counts is not how much calcium and magnesium you obtain but rather how much your body ABSORBS and UTILIZES. Very simply, calcium is difficult to absorb for most people. Life Plus understands that the name of the game is absorption and utilization and therefore CANDY CAL is more than just a calcium supplement.  In addition, CANDY CAL contains the trace element Baron as it has been shown that adequate levels of Boron in our system reduces calcium excretion. Therefore, Boron helps ensure that calcium stores remain up to the levels needed once in the body.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> TYPES OF CALCIUM & MAGNESIUM</H2>
<P> Many calcium supplements contain only inexpensive, inorganic forms of calcium, such as oxides or carbonates.  In general, most of these products are not worthwhile because most of the calcium is not absorbed. Furthermore, different individuals seem to be able to absorb different forms of calcium. This is why Life Plus CANDY CAL not only contains calcium carbonate for its antacid effect, but also provides additional calcium as PolyCalPlex, a Life Plus proprietary blend of high quality calcium sources including citrates, chelates, aspartates, gluconates, ascorbates, glycerophosphates and lactates.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> WHY TAKE CANDY CAL?</H2>
<P>   Individuals who are allergic to dairy products (a major source of calcium in the American diet) can become deficient in calcium and need to supplement with a reliable source of it.</P>
 <P> During pregnancy, mothers need a great deal of calcium  and  magnesium  to  ensure  the  proper development of the fetal bones, muscles and teeth and to ensure that the mother's own mineral stores are not depleted.  Lactating mothers should supplement with a reliable source of calcium.  Growing children need large adequate amounts of calcium in their diets to ensure continuing development of muscles, bones and teeth. If they maintain proper levels of calcium, they will have less tendency toward cavities or broken bones.  CANDY CAL  is  the  perfect  supplement for them, especially when used with <A HREF="msaurus.htm">VITA-SAURUS</A>.</P>
<P>  Anyone who drinks large amounts of soft drinks need extra calcium  because  of the leaching effects of orthophosphoric acid in these drinks.   Carbonated, phosphorylated soft drinks are one cause of bone degeneration.  The increased incidence of this problem has been  shown to correspond to the increased consumption of soft drinks.  Elderly people find it increasingly difficult to absorb calcium and don't seem to  get  enough  magnesium. They  often  develop "osteoporosis," a condition where calcium erodes from the bones, causing them to become weak and brittle. </P>
<P>  Calcium and magnesium are absolutely necessary for healthy muscles. Inadequate levels can lead to muscle cramping, especially in the legs. They are often called "Nature's Tranquilizers" because of their natural calmative effect, not only for muscles but for the nervous system as well.</P>
 <P>  It is obvious that both calcium and magnesium are not only essential but very important nutrients. Life Plus is well aware of this and provides different calcium and magnesium supplements. <A HREF="mmag.htm">MAGNESIUM PLUS</A> and <A HREF="mhydro.htm">HYDRO MAG</A> are designed for taking larger amounts of magnesium when desired. <A HREF="mcalmag.htm"> CALMAG PLUS</A> provides a unique one-to-one ratio of both for balanced supplementation.  Both calcium and magnesium are bulky and difficult to get larger quantities in tablets. CANDY CAL is designed with three goals in mind; 1) provide a good source of extra calcium, 2) can be used as an antacid when needed, and 3) formulated in a pleasant tasting chewable tablet that is easy to use for both children and adults.</P>


<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> PHYTOZYME BASE</H2>
<P>  CANDY CAL is formulated in the proprietary Life Plus Phytozyme base, which contains a unique blend of over thirty natural concentrates of numerous valuable phytonutrients from plants.  When you take Life Plus products, you have the added benefit of receiving the numerous health supporting phytochemicals and other micronutrients contained in them.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HOW TO TAKE CANDY CAL</H2>
<P>  CANDY CAL can be used by those wanting only calcium supplementation. Chewing four tablets during the day provides 120% of the RDA. You can adjust your intake as desired. It can be chewed as an antacid as well when needed.</P>


 <P>
 Suggested Use:  Chew or swallow one or two tablets, two or more times a day as a good tasting calcium 
supplement. Also, use as a natural antacid.</P>
