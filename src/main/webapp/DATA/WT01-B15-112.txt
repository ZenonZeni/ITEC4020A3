The trend continues with the the most senior indices leading the pack. The latest to follow to the upside is the Standard and Poor's 500, now clearly in rally mode. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is just starting to poke above price resistance at 5750. Give it a little while longer to clearly escape from the trading range then watch for some action. The newspapers have been filled with news items about the Dow turning 100 years old, describing it as the most followed of market indices. What this means to me is that when the Dow makes a clear break to new highs the Investing Public will jump aboard, big time. The broad market's rally has been sneaking along in the background. I sense that the senior markets have become laggards-<b>the action will remain in Nasdaq type technology, and emerging US markets.</b> <p>Here are three funds that invest in US small cap/emerging markets. <i>Universal US</i> <i>Emerging Growth</i>. Also has 20.4% of portfolio in technology. One year 62.9%; <i>United American Growth</i>. Invests in small and medium cap. Companies. Has 24.7% in technology. One year 52.2%; <i>20/20 Aggressive Growth</i>. Invests in small and medium cap US companies. Has 58.8% in technology. One year 40.8%. These funds are more volatile than mainstream US funds. Diversify your risk.<p>On other fronts, Fidelity Investments lost ace manager Jeffrey Vinik, who resigned to form his own portfolio management company. Mr. Vinik, who successfully managed the mega Magellan Fund for the past four years-has recently been dogged by slumping performance and controversy. However, under his tutelage Magellan grew from $20 billion to over $50 billion. For perspective, that means that Magellan Fund is about one third the size of the entire Canadian fund industry. The new manager is Robert Stansky, who with Vinik trained under Fidelity legend Peter Lynch. Many Fidelity watchers feel that Mr. Stansky's growth stock philosophy is better suited to managing Magellan.<p>Mr. Vinik's market clout was so great that his resignation triggered a short term panic in the stock and bond markets. Wall Street fretted about the effects of unwinding his massive bond positions into the markets. I wonder if Jeffrey Vinik, high school student, ever dreamed that twenty-five years later he would shift the biggest market in the world by getting a new job?<p>Finally, just when you thought you had all the toys, on Manhattans Lower East Side, you can own your own Internet wired apartment for about CDN$2000 per month, plus about $150 for the ultra-fast "T-1" line to surf the world from downtown New York. That sounds like more fun than most of us could stand. However, a true Cybernaut would live cheap in Montana and surf from there. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/dowjones.gif">Dow Jones<p></a><a href="charts/nasdaq.gif">NASDAQ<p></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade color=#297b63><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td align=center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="ironlady.html"><img src="../images/back.gif" width=55 height=16 border=0 align=left></a><a href="inter.html"><img src="../images/next.gif" width=51 height=16 border=0 align=right></a><a href="index.html#contents"><img src="../images/contents.gif" width=106 height=16 border=0></a></td></tr></table><p><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><center><address><font size=-1><a href="../copyright.html">Copyright and Disclaimer</a></center><p><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><hr noshade><center><address><font size=-1><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Site design by <a href="http://www.compulinks.com">CompuLink Services</a>.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left>Contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@compulinks.com">webmaster@compulinks.com</a> with comments.<br><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2 align=left><a href="http://www.compulinks.com"><img src="../images/smllogo.gif" width=171 height=26 border=0 vspace=5 alt="CompuLink Services"></a></address></font><p><font color=#ffffff>15</center></body></html>
