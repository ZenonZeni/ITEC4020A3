 <h2><Font Color=#408080><em>Dr. Christine Waternaux  </font> 
<br></em>
<br><h3>The Division of Biostatistics was established in January, 1994. The mission of the division is to provide investigators at Psychiatric Institute with access to and training in state-of-the-art statistical techniques as needed for the optimal use of their research data. This includes developing and applying new methodology for the design and analysis of psychiatric studies, participating in major funded research, teaching statistics to researchers and post-doctoral fellows, and providing short-term consultations on data-analytic and design issues for grant submission and manuscript preparation. 
<br>
<br>
<em> <Font Color=#408080> Methodological Research </em></font>
<br>
<br>
Methodological research in the division focuses on problems of particular relevance to psychiatric studies. Areas of expertise in the division include analysis of longitudinal studies with generalized linear models and variance components models, methods for dealing with missing data, causal models, and methodology for combining information from different sources (e.g., meta-analysis). 
<br>
<br>
For example, Dr. Christine Waternaux, Director, is investigating methods for power computations with longitudinal repeated measures. She has also investigated and published on the use of hierarchical models for combining psychiatric data. 
<br>
<br>
Dr. Eva Petkova, Associate Biostatistician, is specializing in statistical models for the analysis of longitudinal studies with informative drop-out. She is developing methodologies for the analysis of clinical trials when the traditional intent-to-treat approach is not appropriate because most drop-outs switch treatments. 
<br>
<br>
Dr. Xinhua Liu, Associate Biostatistician, is experienced in analyzing cohort data (e.g., New York gay man cohort) which traditionally have high dropout rates and a large proportion of missing observations. Her research is addressing the problem of adequacy of different analytical techniques in the presence of missing data. 
<br>
<br>
<em><Font Color=#408080>  Collaborative and Consultative Activities </em></font>
<br>
<br>
Division staff have been very active in their collaborative and consultative efforts, thus demonstrating the great need for such services. For instance, in 1994, staff provided statistical input and participated in nineteen grant submissions. In April 1994, Dr. Christine Waternaux became the Director of the Biostatistics and Measurement Core of the NIMH-funded Clinical Research Center for the Study of Youth
Depression, Anxiety, and Suicide (Principal Investigator: Dr. David Shaffer). 
<br>
<br>
In September 1994, Dr. Waternaux became the Director of the Statistics and Computing Core of the Clinical Research Center for the Study of Suicidal Behavior (Principal Investigator: Dr. J. John Mann).  Division staff are also participating in consultations and meetings with the Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Management Core of the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies (Directors: Drs. Anke Erhardt and Zena Stein). 
<br>
<br>
As part of its training component, the division conducts weekly workshops in biostatistics and data management. These workshops illustrate analytic and data management issues, and explore emerging statistical methodologies in both fields. 
<br>
<br>
Topics covered this year have included random regression models, principles of modeling, meta-analysis, generalized estimating equations, and structural equation modeling.
<br>
<br>
Division staff are also working with the Department of Postgraduate Education and with members of the NIMH Training Programs for Clinical and Research Fellows on matters concerning the statistical curriculum.
