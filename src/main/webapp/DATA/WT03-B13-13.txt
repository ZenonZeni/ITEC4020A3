Net.January: We look at the future of the Web, and ponder the online gender
gap


The beginning of the year is a traditional time to think about
the future, and in the net biz we have more than a little future
to look forward to. In four years, we'll have reached the millenium
a nice round number that's as good a place as any to aim for.

We sent Karen Heyman out to talk to a bunch of Smart People
about what the Web will look like in the year 2000. Everyone
had their own ideas, but they all agreed on two things: that
the Web is here to stay, and that it will look nothing like
what we've got today. The story's called "Web 2000," and it
starts on page 52.

You've Got Mail

But for now, we're still dealing with the net as we know it
and for most of us, that means e-mail. Kevin Reichard surveyed
the world of Windows and Mac e-mail clients, and found a lot
of excellent programs for not a lot of money. "Push the E-Mail
Envelope," starting on page 60, tells you what we picked as
the best of a good lot.

Weaving a Web

The first question about the Web is generally, "How do I write
my own home page?" The second (and more important) question
is usually, "Where do I put my page so people can see it?"

The three biggest online services have been slow to let their
users become part of the Web. That's changed, as America Online,
CompuServe and Prodigy now give their clients Web space and
a simple non-HTML means to create pages.

Of course, neither all pages nor all online services are created
equal. Frequent contributor Joel T. Patz clues us in on which
one is best. The story about "Pre-Fab Home Pages" starts on
page 76.

Women Online

One of the enduring questions about online life is where all
the women are. The latest survey shows that about one-third
of the people online are female, but that's significantly less
than the half of the population that are women. Judith Broadhurst,
an expert in the field of women online, spoke to many women
some connected, some not-and got them to explain what it is
they're looking for. "Bridging the Gender Gap" starts on page
84.

And Also 

Net.News this month offers tips on how not to be a victim of
online scams, reminds you how to tell the difference between
a denizen of California's Silicon Valley and New York's Silicon
Alley, and clues you in on your phone company's plans for Internet
access.

In Workshops, you'll learn the ins and outs of IRC, how to get
your small business online, what graphic tools you really need,
and what the top 10 planning issues are that Webmasters need
to pay attention to.

And, of course, don't forget our columnists, the reviews in
Net.Results, and the customary 300 ratings and reviews in CyberGuide.

Happy New Year!

Net Mail: The Ones That Got Away


In the November 1995 issue of NetGuide, you provided a rather
comprehensive review of the more popular and current versions
of browsers ("New Directions for Browsers," page 56). Why not
follow up with something about the grandfather of them all
 NCSA Mosaic and Cello. These two browsers have been around
for quite some time. They are not as flashy as Netscape, but
they will work on the millions of computers manufactured before
1995 that have been sold with 4 MB of RAM or even less.

Howard Bingham

Houston

I didn't see any mention of CompuServe's Spry Mosaic in the
article and wasn't sure what that means. I'm also confused
about the term "Mosaic" when it's used by itself or as "Spry
Mosaic." Is this the same browser?

Jack Galloway

Snohomish, Wash.

I was dismayed to discover that you did not include OS/2 WebExplorer
in your survey of Web browsers. I would have liked to see how
it stacked up against the several Windows/Mac browsers you
did include in your review. WebExplorer has been available
for a year now. What are you waiting for?

Charles Henrich

New York

NCSA's "Mosaic" was the first graphical browser in widespread
use, and its core technology was licensed widely in early 1995.
That's why so many browsers have the name Mosaic, even though
they're evolving in very different directions. That confuses
you, and it confused us. Spry Mosaic accidentally dropped out
of our November roundup; we did, however, review it in December
as part of the excellent Mosaic In A Box.

NCSA Mosaic and Cello didn't appear because they are now second
tier products whose technology has been passed by. We didn't
include WebExplorer because there is no other major browser
for the OS/2 platform; if you're running OS/2, you don't have
much of a choice, and if you're not using OS/2, WebExplorer
isn't enough of a reason to change your mind.

Net Mail: Sharing Wares


In "Party Girl Lets Loose on the Net" (October 1995, page 29),
Ron Bel Bruno refers to the software program CU-SeeMe as a
"public-domain shareware program." Being a shareware author
myself, I find it astounding that two very different types
of software would be combined into one. I suppose that "public
domain shareware" is something akin to "military intelligence"
and "journalistic research," no?

Brad Stowers

Raleigh, N.C.

CU-SeeMe is freeware, but its copyright is held by Cornell University.

Net Mail: No Integration?



As one who came to the Internet through one of those user-friendly,
convenient online services, I have recently been surprised
to discover an almost complete lack of integrated software
for accessing the Internet. It seems to me that one or more
software engineers would recognize this as a golden unserved
market niche and dive in with a new product, yet I continue
to be told that no integrated suite or all-Internet "front
end" exists. Frankly, this is astonishing to me.

David Ritter

Angwin, Calif.

You're told wrong. We'll be reviewing these so-called "box solutions"
in the near future.

Net Mail: Wrap Music


Regarding the November 1995 Net.Mail letter "Wrapping It Up,"
I'd prefer to add slightly to the "waste disposal problem"
and receive my monthly issue in one undamaged piece. Enclosing
the magazine in plastic makes it just a little tougher for
the U.S. Postal Service to destroy.

Net Mail: Columny


The last paragraph in Mark Eckenwiler's Net.Law column (November
1995, page 39) says that it should trouble us all that a person
served with a subpoena would have to choose between self-incrimination
and contempt of court. How about being honest and telling the
truth? What really troubles me is that because the criminal
conspirators of the example were co-workers, we're supposed
to bend the law and become co-conspirators to help them get
away with their crimes. Honest people don't have to lie or
worry about self-incrimination.

Herb Zieman

I commend Dan Rosenbaum for his use of the immigrant metaphor
in his November 1995 column on the new wave of Internet users
(page 17). I found it both apt and imaginative. However, there
is another source of hostility that will continue to exist
on the net that has far less to do with the clash between new
and old than it does with the human animal.

The Internet is the great equalizer of this era, and we are
all potential Davids against our perceived Goliaths. People
lash out on the Internet because they can-because they are
insulated and safe behind their screens-and this is an unfortunate
by-product of an otherwise indispensable form of communication.

But I suppose this is simply another example of the Internet
paradox: Just as the system unites us, it keeps us very much
apart.

Net Mail: Immorality in Cyberspace



I would like to congratulate the authorities who caught those
responsible for trafficking child porn and seducing minors
online ("FBI Thwarts E-mail Porn Ring," December 1995, page
21). It is those [people] who give online services and the
Internet a bad name. While I believe in free expression on
the Internet, I also believe that it's an absolute disgrace
to abuse this exciting technology. Once again, the crimes of
a few are ruining it for the rest of us.

Brian Hedden

Old Bridge, N.J.

In response to a letter written by Stephen W. Nicholas in the
November 1995 issue (page 11), I must say that Mr. Nicholas,
who claims we must "prevent the tyranny that comes from too
much freedom," seems to be barking up the wrong tree.

What is "frightening" about "the fact that the average citizen
has access to a numbingly vast amount of information"? Free
information access sets humans free from any oppressors.

Government regulation will not prevent immorality from invading
cyberspace. The only way to have nothing to fear is to educate
people to understand their fears and to take individual action
to protect against them.

Net Mail: CyberGuide



While your monthly listing of interesting sites is great and
well-organized, it's becoming increasingly difficult with each
issue to recall sites from previous issues. As a result, your
listings provide instant gratification, but little value as
a reference. How about an ongoing annotated index online, perhaps
on your own Web site?

Steve Rosenberg

Vienna, Va.

We've tuned our online listings so they're organized by subject,
in addition to month. You no longer need to know when a review
ran in order to find it.

As I was reading the "You Want Fries With That Modem?" story

I stained the pages in your magazine. I appreciate the humor
in your "planting" of the coffee cup stains.

Net.Editor: The current coarsening of the net has little to do with newbies

By:
Dan Rosenbaum

Is there really an online community? Assuming there is, I sometimes
wonder if I really want to be a part of it.

Depending on whose abacus you use, there are either about 8
million, 15 million, or 20 million of us online geeks in the
United States. As far as the worldwide Internet population
is concerned, you'll probably get a shrug for an answer, but
an estimate of 30 million seems fair.

That's a lot of people-on the scale of New York, Mexico City,
or Tokyo. Populations like that are in a weird netherzone.
They're not big enough to make a serious demographic dent.
A television show with 8 million viewers, for instance, is
on the fast track to cancellation. But 8 million people can
make a lot of noise, especially when they're equipped with
computers and modems.

It's the noise that worries me. There's always been a certain
amount of noise on the net, a side attraction to the great
information that's available for the mining. The noise level
rose and fell with the season (early fall and midwinter were
usually the worst), but it was generally possible to ignore
or tolerate it.

In the last year, the noise level has risen dramatically. Spams
and e-mail bombing are a weekly occurrence. What was once the
occasional appearance of a chain letter has become an unremitting
cadence. Constant struggles continue between regular participants
of some newsgroups and those people who seem intent in drowning
out the group's charter simply because they have a spare week.

This behavior is not new. I have fond memories of the "cats"
conference in the earliest days of the BIX online service,
which devolved quickly and hilariously (if somewhat tastelessly)
into a debate between cat fanciers and cat haters. Perhaps
the exact point is that the same people were frequently on
both sides of the "battle." In this particular case, the noise
was the signal.

Not very long ago, any material that was even remotely salacious
or offensive would be "rot-13"-ed, the letters substituted
for others 13 letters away: "a" becomes "n," "b" becomes "o."
"Sheesh" becomes "furrfu," and vice versa. (Try it, it's fun!)
Newsreaders could translate a posting into a rot-13ed text
with a single keystroke, protecting even the daintiest sensibility.
Yet, anyone could read such a posting if desired.

Rot-13 still exists on Usenet, but its use is now nearly archaic.
People just post what they want to say. The rights of the person
who might not want to see something inappropriate or upsetting
have been almost totally overtaken by the rights of a poster
hell-bent on free expression.

I'm hardly the only person worried about this. You may or may
not realize that the technical basis for the Internet is a
series of Requests for Comments that have been circulated widely,
discussed, and agreed upon. RFCs are what make the net work.
Most of them deal with abstruse technical questions of data
communications and message formatting. But there is now an
RFC 1855, which attempts to codify netiquette. Created by Sally
Hambridge at Intel, RFC 1855 is a lengthy and detailed discussion
of the dos and don'ts of the net. It is so detailed, in fact,
that most newbies will never hear about it and never read it.

There's another problem with RFC 1855: The coarsening of the
net has little to do with newbies. It's not newbies who crosspost
chain letters across the world. It's not newbies who take over
newsgroups. It's not newbies who set electronic robots loose
to cancel posts they deem "wrong." It's sophisticated users,
operating sophisticated tools, who are making the net a worse
place to be.

Of course, it's the rowdies who often affect how a community
is perceived. If a town is full of graffiti, or if the grass
on the highway berms is unkempt, the town will look neglected,
and reality will usually follow the perception.

That's why I'm so worried about the future of The WELL.

The WELL-Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link-has long been one of the
special places on the net. It can trace its lineage directly
back to the Community Memory project, in which customers of
the San Francisco-area Whole Earth stores could type essays,
thoughts, commentaries, or just plain ramblings into strategically
placed computer terminals.

Other people could respond to those postings, or start off on
entire new topics of their own. It was an experiment in interactivity,
in community, in communications. A commercial success it was
not. But Community Memory was an important piece of the mosaic
that became the online world.

One of the great things about The WELL-perhaps the single greatest
thing-is its clientele. Among its several thousand customers
are the very people making the electronic revolution happen.
It's a notoriously tough audience: Know what you're talking
about when you post, or you risk getting reduced to cinders.
On the other hand, The WELL's conferences read like a history
of online communication. It was the place where Time magazine's
notorious cyberporn story got debunked, and it's one of the
places that helped track down hacker Kevin Mitnick.

It used to be hard to get to The WELL. It's in the San Francisco
Bay Area, and for the longest time it required a long-distance
call if you weren't in the neighborhood. Even after the service
allowed access over the Internet via Telnet, The WELL remained
steadfastly terminal-based. No graphical interfaces here. If
you wanted to participate in a conference, you had to learn
an admittedly arcane command structure. The users seemed to
like it that way. Keeps out the bozos, they said.

But this past fall, The WELL introduced a new interface based
on the World Wide Web. Now, for $5 a month, you can fire up
your Web browser and dive in. The WELL is now simple and uncomplicated
even if the users are still a tough audience.

But if The WELL becomes easy to use, easy to get to, and easy
to afford, what's to keep it from getting overrun by the same
vandals who seem intent on ruining the rest of the net? Are
we on the verge of losing one of our special places?

The folks at The WELL say no. What will protect them, they say,
is their sense of community. That doesn't mean keeping out
all outsiders. Quite the opposite; they seem to believe strongly
in the need for new blood I wrote about in this space two months
ago.

The answer, they say, lies in the concept of community. It's
absurd to believe that 20 million people form any sort of community
just because they happen to inhabit the same non-space. In
some ways, I have more in common with the person who works
in the office next to mine than I do with my upstairs neighbor;
in other ways, the reverse is true.

We all belong to many communities, and the ones defined by proximity
or distance have become for many of us-particularly those of
us who are online-the least important. If a community is best
defined as a group of people with a common interest, the net
is awash with overlapping communities. And communities defend
themselves.

This is not necessarily a popular concept online. More than
once, I've seen angry exchanges between people who post inappropriately
and someone trying to correct them. Inevitably, the original
poster will send a sentence like, "Who appointed you the Net
Police?" At that point, of course, most useful discourse between
the parties in question has ended.

But the question is worth following. We're all the net police.
We all need to defend our online communities against the thoughtless
and destructive elements who are undeniably there. The net
is not some anarchic outpost where people can do what they
want. Its very existence is predicated on and depends upon
cooperation. If the larger online community of more than 30
million is to survive, people in the smaller communities will
have to stand tall and take the necessary measures to keep
their areas the way they want them.

You would do as much in your home, you would do as much where
you work, and you would do as much in your town. If you believe
in the online community, you need to do as much on the net.@

Net.News: Been Scammed? How to Avoid Becoming an Online Sucker

By:
Cynthia Kurkowski

Ever wonder how you could still mail a first-class letter using
a 2-cent stamp? Or how you could repair a bad credit record
by just paying the right people? Such bogus claims are the
stuff of which online scams are made.

Whether its investment fraud, money-making pyramids, illegal
credit repair offers, or even false software reseller fronts,
the net's shadowy anonymity is a real lure for scam artists.
According to the Federal Trade Commission, frauds commonly
appear as classified advertising or forum or bulletin board
notices. These postings are disguised as testimonials about
the quality and performance of a particular product or service.
Unscrupulous marketers even use chat rooms to pose as "satisfied
customers" who extol the virtues of fraudulent goods and services.

Thankfully, the same warning signs of a shady deal that you'd
look for in the physical world also apply to online scams.
Exaggerated claims, urgent sale closing deadlines, promises
of quick and easy profits, disclosures of insider trading information,
and unsubstantiated claims are a few of these dead giveaways.
In fact, the FTC's Web page at http://www.ftc.gov/ lists these
and more tips on how to distinguish a scam.

"It's in a new forum, [but] the old rules still apply," says
Lynn Collins, spokeswoman for the National Advertising Division
of the Council of Better Business Bureaus (CBBB). Recently,
the division's authority to evaluate false or misleading advertising
was extended to the net.

The most popular online scams, according to the FTC, result
from consumers ordering software online from vanishing vendors.
To avoid such a bilk, Lee Peeler, associate director of advertising
practices at the FTC, says it's best to authorize a credit
card purchase only after you've had a chance to review the
product, or until it's received. Thanks to the shareware movement,
a reputable software vendor will offer either a demo of the
application or a trial period if you ask for it.

Here are some additional tips for checking out a potential online
scam:

Procure a physical address. "This is important if a complaint
is to be filed or action is taken against the company. Consumers
should always be wary of P.O. box businesses," Peeler says.
These addresses, he says, are often the proxy for individuals
using their home computers as agents of fraud.

Do your homework. Peeler suggests using newsgroups and chat
rooms to get references before making a purchase. (However,
it's important to verify the source of at least two or three
such references, to make sure they're not false claims planted
by scammers.) When in doubt, the FTC also suggests you contact
your Internet or online service provider with information about
suspicious sites or promotions.

To check financial or investment offers, consult the Securities
and Exchange Commission at the Office of Consumer Affairs.
The commission can tell you if an investment is registered
or if a salesperson is licensed to sell what's being offered.

Use a credit card. Despite the security issues of releasing
credit card information over the Internet, Peeler says, "When
you go outside the credit card purchasing system, you lose
protection. There aren't any billing-disputes rights to protect
you from unauthorized purchases or theft."

Make that call. Online fraud is clearly a global issue, though
its enforcement remains a regional duty. Report suspicious
businesses or individuals to your local Better Business Bureau,
Consumer Protection Agency or Attorney General's office. The
CBBB is adding a complaint form to its home page and plans
to add an Internet scam alert section. If you feel a particular
advertisement is either misleading or completely false, the
CBBB will evaluate your claim. If it determines the complaint
valid, it then will ask the advertiser to comply with ethical
standards before taking legal action. The National Fraud Information
Center's toll-free phone service, at 800-876-7060, takes fraud
reports and answers consumers' questions about online scams.

Report all losses. Collins urges consumers to report deceitful
businesses, no matter how little the loss. "You can help others
in the future to determine which businesses are ethical or
not," Collins says. "Scam artists depend on that $20 or $30
from thousands of people the same as if they have received
$1 million from [one] individual."

Net.News: The Nielsen Survey Says 

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

You're smart, you're relatively well-paid, and you have about
a one-in-three chance of being a woman. According to a recent
Nielsen Media Research survey commissioned by CommerceNet,
you're the typical Internet user.

The study bases its findings on 4,200 phone surveys-methodology
that distinguishes it from other Internet reports typically
conducted on the net. The study says 37 million people in North
America over 16 years of age enjoy net access. Those surveyed
are generally better educated, with higher incomes, than the
general population. Among other findings, the study's respondents
average 5-1/2 hours a week online. And while males represent
66 percent of net users, they actually create 77 percent of
network traffic. Meanwhile, 31 percent of all respondents report
daily net access.

Net.News: From the Alley to the Valley-Cyberspace's Great Bicoastal Divide

By:
Kate Gerwig

It's the difference between lofts and cubicles art and engineering
coffee and Coke hip and geek. It's the difference between Silicon
Alley and Silicon Valley.

Since the mid-1970s, when San Jose, Calif., and its environs
were dubbed Silicon Valley, the region has reigned as the mecca
of advanced computer development. Meanwhile, on the Right Coast,
whatever New York's Silicon Alley (a nebulous downtown zone
comprising parts of Soho, Chelsea, and the Flatiron District)
lacks in terms of propeller-head quotient it abounds in artsy
design resources-a precious net commodity. That's why MCI/News
Corp's Delphi, Prodigy's content division, and CompuServe's
Entertainment Drive are nesting there.

NetGuide informally surveyed professional residents of both
Silicons to compile this graphical rendering (left) of East
and West.

Net.News: News Filters Stem the Tide

By:
Lynn Ginsburg

Had it with online news overload? Personalized news services
deliver only the stories you need or want to see.

Both Microsoft and Ziff-Davis Interactive already have debuted
customized news services. The latest entry is Individual Inc.'s
personalized news service, iNews, which was expected to debut
on the Microsoft Network by press time. INews lets subscribers
set criteria to filter numerous news sources. It draws information
from hundreds of newswires, magazines, newsletters, and newspapers,
with major media sources like the Associated Press, Business
Wire, Reuters, Newsbytes, IDG Communications, Ziff Davis Publishing
Co., and CMP Publications Inc. (NetGuide's parent company)

The iNews configuration employs the venerable Microsoft Wizard
system, helping you choose up to 10 topics as filters for your
news profile. Thereafter, iNews generates a new issue every
night, sending you up to 20 briefs for your chosen topics and
industries. When clicked upon, links within each brief take
you to Individual's Web site of full-text stories.

INews monthly subscription prices are low-$6.90 per month, or
$3.95 if you allow your name to be sold for marketing purposes.
The higher price keeps you untouchable.

You can tap Ziff Davis Interactive's personalized news service,
ZD Net Personal View, via the company's ZD Net/World Wide Web
Edition. Unlike iNews, advertiser-sponsored Personal View is
free to registered users. However, news is limited to computer
topics, drawn from PC Magazine, MacWeek, and other Ziff publications,
plus computer industry news distributors like Newsbytes, Business
Wire, and PR Newswire.

Personal View users must fill out a personal profile to set
news filters. When you log into the service each day, you're
presented with the stories that match your personal profile.

Net.News: An MSN Progress Report

By:
Kate Gerwig

The sky was supposed to fall for America Online, CompuServe,
and Prodigy when Microsoft launched its Microsoft Network last
August.

However, the sky appears to be holding, with the major online
services working hard to improve their offerings and to maintain
subscribers. Microsoft even feels it deserves some credit for
whatever overall improvements the market experiences. "The
fact that Microsoft entered the business, in some ways, raised
the bar for online services. Suddenly, they're improving their
services and coming up with more friendly user interfaces,"
says Naveen Jain, MSN senior technical marketing manager.

Microsoft remains mum on exact subscriber numbers, but industry
analysts estimate MSN acquired more than 400,000 subscribers
after its first two months in business. Before MSN launched,
some analysts predicted up to 10 million users would sign on
by the end of 1995. Meanwhile, Microsoft evangelists are keeping
to a more modest goal-1 million subscribers by the end of its
first year.

Early reviews of MSN criticized its alleged lack of bells and
whistles. This is not unusual, according to Jupiter Communications
analyst Adam Schoenfeld. He believes that while Microsoft did
"a bad job of rolling MSN out, it would have been impossible
to live up to the hype surrounding it."

In an attempt at maximum quality control, Microsoft maintains
it will cap its MSN subscriber base at 500,000 temporarily
while it works out any bugs. Jain says the company wants to
get feedback from its subscribers and improve the service any
way it can before opening the gates again.

Inteco Corp. vice president and market analyst Rob Rubin is
skeptical about the strategy: "That would be like turning away
money. I don't think it's in their nature to do that."

Net.News: Log On, Look Around, Tune Out

By:
Kate Gerwig

Since the dawn of online services some 16 years ago, about 6.2
million home PC users have tuned in, then ditched an online
account, a new study claims.

A mail survey of 10,000 U.S. households in August by Inteco
Corp., a Norwalk, Conn., market forecasting firm, reveals high
cancellation rates on America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe,
GEnie and Delphi.

While the online services themselves don't like to talk about
"churn" rates, varying estimates report that 30 to 50 percent
of those who join an online service each year eventually cancel.
Inteco vice president and market analyst Rob Rubin said the
results don't mean business is bad. "The online industry continues
to experience excellent growth, but our study clearly indicates
there's little brand loyalty and that there's a significant
amount of dissatisfaction with all of the services," he says.

Actually, many of the deserters never truly subscribed at all.
Among the household users surveyed, Inteco found that many
simply depart after a free trial period is over. Many PC users
switch from one service to another to take advantage of free
trials or to try out new features, Rubin said. Eventually they
cancel the less satisfactory of the two to avoid paying two
monthly charges.

Net.News: Dishing Out Net Access

By:
Kate Gerwig

Rather than dispensing Internet access by the hour, Hughes Network
Systems simply charges information junkies by the megabyte.

DirecPC, Hughes' high-speed, satellite-based Internet access
service, is probably too pricey for a novice user. But if you
need lots of information and you're tired of spending 45 minutes
dusting your computer while downloading a large file, DirecPC's
scheme could be your ticket, with 400-Kbps data throughout.

After you shell out $995 for the right hardware, which includes
a 24-inch satellite dish, an adapter card, and Windows-based
software, Hughes offers a $15.95 monthly subscription for 30
megabytes of usage, or $39.95 a month for 130 megabytes.

For this expense, surely you'll want to cost-justify DirecPC
in your household budget. "You probably wouldn't download a
6 MB video clip from a Disney movie with your average modem,
unless you had extra time on your hands," says a DirecPC representative.
Lucky for you, time is not of the essence.

To make for a more rounded content offering, DirecPC also offers
CNN Headline and Reuters news, as well as stock and sports
news. Originally targeted to businesses, the system currently
is available in the United States and Canada.

Net.News: You Want My What?


Call it low-rent hacking-or just plain sleazy-but a bunch of
online marauders have been, under a variety of ruses, out to
pilfer passwords from unsuspecting America Online subscribers.

A NetGuide editor received the above "instant message" one rainy
October night in a chat area. However, according to AOL advisories,
employees of the service would never require a subscribers
to divulge a password online.

In most cases, the offending sender's screen name is generated
by AOHell, a hacker program. This underground software can,
among other wily attributes, generate renegade AOL accounts
by creating falsified new-user sign-up information.

Net.News: "I Want My Web TV!"

By:
Kate Gerwig

Tired of booting up your PC to Web surf? How about using a special
TV, or an "Internet box" attached to your TV set, instead?

Though Oracle Corp. hasn't officially announced a "Web TV" product,
Lawrence Ellison, the company's chairman and CEO, discussed
introducing such a product in a speech he gave during an October
telecommunications industry conference. Compaq Corp. also has
announced a similar project in conjunction with Intel Corp.
to create an "Internet Surfer."

Such preliminary announcements give birth to interesting speculations
among experts. At the Yankee Group, a Boston-based consultancy,
for example, analyst Gregory Wester thinks what might actually
materialize from Oracle or another vendor is a set-top Internet
box-much like a cable TV converter. Still, Wester thinks this
approach is limited. "Traditional PC users are used to working
on specific applications," he says.

While David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments,
a New York money-management research firm specializing in interactive
technology, lauds Oracle for tackling such a project, he sees
the price point as crucial. Even $500 is too steep for the
mass market, according to Simons. "In the world of consumer
electronics, the price tag should be about $250," he says.

Net.News: Wow! Woos Net Novices

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

Novices will get a shiny pair of training wheels this spring
when CompuServe's hush-hush Project Wow! online service debuts.

At first blush, this new venue seems to be pitted against America
Online and Prodigy. But according to Scott Kauffman, CompuServe's
vice president for consumer markets and Project Wow! leader,
the company "is not marketing against anyone" with this combination
online service/Internet access product. Still, the groups Kauffman
says Wow! will target-families, young professionals, and seniors
constitute a huge chunk of those services' users. For these
folks, "the technology has to become invisible," he says. To
that end, Kauffman says Wow! will provide "a proper balance
[of] content, community, and customization."

The company hopes to attract 1 million subscribers in its first
year. "We're trying to put the Internet in context," Kauffman
says. "We're not going to prevent adult men and women from
having a full Internet experience."

Mark Mooradian, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, in New
York, says CompuServe may miss the boat by launching its new
service so long after other, similar offerings.

Net.Dern

By:
Daniel Dern

We lost another valuable Internet resource in October. It was
the victim of the cluelessness engendered by the very same
national online services that are busily hyping themselves
as purveyors of the Internet.

When Catherine Yronwode, an America Online subscriber, was denied
Usenet posting privileges by the mail2news@cs.utexas.edu gateway,
she posted a long, threatening letter of complaint to news.admin.misc
and a dozen or so other newsgroups.

The response of gateway-keeper Fletcher Mattox, who'd been responsible
for providing this free-for-use, unfunded resource for a decade,
was that of any sensible, overworked system administrator supporting
a volunteer project. He pulled the plug. (Yronwode's activity
was not the sole cause of his decision. Her outburst, however,
was inarguably the event that caused Mattox to decide it was
time to call it quits.)

Many of the unofficial but valuable resources in the pre-deluge
Internet and Usenet were similar labors of love. So, as they
get shut-or shot-down, how can they be replaced? And as new
services get offered, how can they be funded in ways that are
self-sustaining? Well, it depends on what kind of information
resource you're talking about. Once you pare away the services
that we'll gladly pay for, like BusinessWire or Dow Jones,
you've got sites offering sales and marketing information from
the likes of Apple, IBM, Sony, and others that will gladly
pay to hawk their wares. What's left? A large middle ground,
comprising commercial advertising and sponsorship.

With sponsorship, businesses subsidize the online content we
do want, in return for attaching their own messages somewhere
within the content (it's the same theory as commercial TV).
During the past year or so, sponsors have discovered the Internet,
and the Internet has discovered the money font of sponsorships.
In fact, there's no shortage of resources soliciting sponsorship.
(For a list of prices for links and sponsorships, see http
//www.netcreations.com/ipa/adindex.htm; for a list of "sponsorable"
sites and resources, see http://www.trafficresource.com/.)

However, few companies are willing to sponsor sites without
first getting some information about the site's traffic-preferably
evidence of "readership." In current Internet jargon, that
means counting hits. Sponsors want reassurance, and sites want
to command top price.

Mandatory registration is one scheme that gathers user IDs and
passwords-along with demographics, in some cases-for the service
provider. This arrangement, initially employed by sites like
GNN, HotWired and others, has proved less than fruitful. Most
of us are already drowning in passwords and IDs. What's more,
if these systems are so smart, why can't they validate us based
on information from our browsers?

But why keep people out when your goal is to rope them in? Only
interested parties will stay for more than a screen's worth
or two anyway. Sites like HotWired have adopted flexible strategies,
putting enough of the information outside the "IDs required"
zone that we can, at least, get a taste without having to go
through registration first.

Meanwhile, advertisers want hits. So sites run counting programs,
which usually watch downloads of a graphic near the top of
an entry page. Companies like Nielsen and I/PRO have announced
"site monitoring and hit reporting/analysis" services to slice
and dice this traffic data.

There's only one problem. The data's meaningless. For one thing,
lots of people aren't downloading the hit-triggering items.
They may have their browsers set to "no-graphics" mode, to
expedite page-getting.

This method doesn't count users employing a non-graphics browser,
like Lynx, which doesn't even touch graphics (unless you're
using a shell-enhancer like SLIPknot or I-Comm, or finding
and grabbing images "by hand"). This situation alone invalidates
most count figures.

Yet another, more practical issue: A user may come in via the
side door, by zooming below the top page to something on a
lower page, never triggering the graphics. Add this user to
the pile of visitors the hit-counters won't catch.

Some Webwatchers out there don't rely on watching one or two
pieces, but instead watch all requests. Does this mean data
we can count on? Once again, no. Many users have their Webware
set to cache-that is, to save retrievals on disk. Many sites
use "proxies" that cache these retrieval requests. So if Users
B, C and D request a Web URL that User A's already asked for,
B's, C's, and D's requests will be fulfilled locally-from the
cached copy-instead of dragging duplicates across the Internet.

This scheme helps reduce unnecessary load on a site's Internet
connection. That's a good thing, since three or four Mosaic
users grabbing weather maps can saturate a 56-kilobit-per-second
line. But for advertisers, it means site visitors are seeing
the content they sponsor without being counted.

One solution would be Web servers and browsers that could send
back hit reports whenever a URL was examined from a local cache
instead of being retrieved again. If Webware would check a
URL's "last-modified" data automatically before deciding whether
to retrieve or use what's cached, hit-counters could get this
as by-product.

But all this still begs the question-because it's not a done
deal-are hits the appropriate currency to assess Web usage?
Even those actual download-based hits don't mean anything.
The Web is bursting with people looking at sites because of
"coolness," or just cruising at random. "Sure, it's nice to
see tens or hundreds of thousands, even millions of hits in
a Web log," says Larry Chase, president of The Online Ad Agency
(http://advert.com). "But what's the sense if all they do is
hit your home page and bounce off into the atmosphere, never
to be heard from again?"

"The trick is attracting qualified leads that eventually lead
to conversions," Chase says. Conversions may be immediate orders,
or requests for brochures or prices, but they indicate definite
interest in the company and its offerings.

Companies shouldn't read too much into hits per day, or even
hit levels after specific announcements. "Some sales cycles
are longer than others," Chase points out. "800

FLOWERS has a short sales cycle, while Liberty Mutual Insurance
has a longer one. The key is tracking from when the conversions
came, not the hits. I'd gladly pay more for a stream of qualified
prospects that are apt to turn into conversions than less for
thousands of meaningless visitors, who'll forget I ever existed
three clicks after they left my site." Any site that can report
conversions and customers, not just a lot of hits, is bound
to make the short list when a company is evaluating which sites
to sponsor.

But there may still be a role for hit-watching. For example,
good hit reporting can track derivative information, like how
many visitors become customers or how long it usually takes
(do they buy on the first or fourth visit?). This can help
a site manager re-evaluate and fine-tune the selling part of
the Web.

If you still think hits can be meaningful, here are two Internet
tools I've conceptualized: HitMaker and BrowserBeater. IMHBCO
(In My Humble But Correct Opinion), these products would render
hit-counting meaningless. HitMaker would take a list of URLs
and "hit" them with specified frequency-a great way to inflate
hit counts. It wouldn't be long before the credibility of hit
counts would suffer. The flip side of the coin would be BrowserBeater.
This anonymous Web browser would work in tandem with a proxy
server to shield your identifying information. To access ID
required sites like HotWired, BrowserBeater would "borrow"
names from appropriate lists of pre-registered IDs and passwords
for such Web sites.

The HitMaker and BrowserBeater could skew a site's hit rate
significantly. But even if they're never developed, I don't
think it would change hit-counting's diminishing status. If
sponsors are going to require "proof of value" from sites,
let's give them a meaningful metric.

Net.Media

By:
Michelle Slatalla

Phil Gramm waves an American flag in my face. He hopes it'll
remind me of him. Pat Buchanan compiled an archive of patriotic
historical documents for me to read.

And Bill Clinton? He keeps offering to show me photos of him
and Hillary ladling in a soup kitchen.

The 1996 presidential campaign season is going to be different
from all previous years, for one reason-the candidates are
setting up Internet headquarters. It makes sense, in theory,
because it finally will give them a way to bypass the media,
to shovel unlimited amounts of information directly at voters.
A candidate can put up reams of transcripts of his speeches
and put his own spin on these and other facts he disseminates.

"The Internet is perfect for Pat, because his message right
now is not getting past the media. There's a media blackout,"
says Linda Muller, the Internet coordinator for the Buchanan
campaign. "I think people are tired of the media's digestion
and regurgitation anyway. We don't need someone to tell us
what we just heard. Let us draw our own conclusions."

The candidates will rush to cyberspace in the coming months.
I expect that the Old Media-newspaper, TV, and radio reporters
will have to start monitoring the net for news. Already, dozens
of Web sites are conducting straw polls on the candidates and
on issues. Those results might become fertile fodder for news.

"Reporters are still trying to figure out what it means to us,
what it means in terms of doing a complete job covering the
campaign," says Susan Page, White House correspondent for USA
Today. "It's good when people can get information unfiltered,
like they can by watching C-SPAN, for instance. Then they don't
have to have a reporter, who may or may not be smart, filter
it."

In fact, there's a name for the act of cutting out the media
and connecting the viewer with the source. It's "disintermediation,"
one of my favorite big words. Good for using at a cocktail
party. Disintermediation is what the Internet is all about.
Newspapers are limited by space; TV broadcasts are limited
by time. But the net has no time or space constraints. You
can find as much information as you want, whenever you want
it.

New kinds of media emerging online will most likely provide
that detailed level of data. Congressional Quarterly, something
I formerly used as a reference for term papers, could become
an influential media player in this new world, via a Web site.

As far as the candidates are concerned, the Internet's highly
educated voter population-12 million Americans with a penchant
for poring through reams of raw data-are exactly who they want
to reach. This could be a very good thing for us as voters,
since we'll have more direct access to the candidates. We will
no longer have to rely on The New York Times or the networks'
newscasts to give us a quote from last night's rubber-chicken
dinner policy speech. Instead, we can log into a candidate's
home page and read the full text, then click to a hyperlink
that tells us how he voted on the same issues in the past.

For candidates trailing in the polls-those who can't afford
30-second ad spots on prime-time TV shows-the Internet will
be a great equalizer. Setting up a home page on the Web is
cheap. Case in point: A campaign volunteer designed Buchanan's
for free and hung it on a server for only 50 cents a month
per megabyte of data (the first 5 MB are free)

Candidates with deeper pockets will be able to experiment with
the Internet more intensely. For instance, a Boulder, Colo.
based Web site called Votelink (http://www.votelink.com/) is
hoping candidates will be willing to pay from $2,500 to $15,000
a month for a package that includes surveys of voters' perceptions
of major issues and the candidates' platforms. Votelink online
forums let the candidate (or his aides) sit at a computer and
answer voters' questions directly.

But let's take a deep breath before we start predicting that
online campaigns will totally transform the political landscape.
Before I looked at any of the presidential candidates' home
pages, I toyed with the idea that the net would elect the next
president. But the current state of cyberspace campaigns tempered
my enthusiasm.

So far, most of the candidates' pages are unimaginative-a click
over to AT&T's site was exciting in comparison. There's a communications
problem here if I'd rather read about how switches work than
compare the candidates' abortion platforms.

Maybe it's because the whole Web thing is new to them; after
all, they've been doing it for only a few months. The presidential
candidates figured out the first step back in mid-1995: Get
online and that will be enough of a novelty to garner a front
page story in The Wall Street Journal.

The next step will be far more difficult. These politicians,
who for the most part aren't too computer-literate themselves,
will have to learn how to use the Internet more creatively
to deliver their messages.

For now, the candidates seem content to mimic each other, with
straightforward text blocks dryly explaining their views on
abortion, the budget, taxes, and other topics that could use
some multimedia effects.

The candidates' personal idiosyncrasies manage to peek through,
of course. But I wonder if that's even something they did on
purpose. Lamar Alexander-who pundits expect will rally with
one of the more savvy net campaigns, since he's an outsider
looking for a new medium for his message-wallpapered his page
(http://www.nashville.net/~lamar/) to resemble his signature
flannel shirt. Buchanan's home page (http://www.buchanan.org
) has a definite colonial style to it, with an emblem of an
American Eagle and the Buchanan Brigade Library, an online
archive of documents that includes stories about Paul Revere,
poems, and prayers.

Clinton's family photos on the White House's official home page
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/) have the studied feel of a project
that 50 editors signed off on. I got the same feeling from
watching his biographical video at the Democratic Convention
in 1992. He has so many handlers that it is becoming increasingly
impossible for him to convey anything authentic about himself
as a person.

The same can be said for Bob Dole, judging from his home page
(http://www.dole96.com/), where the hyper-glossy images of
him smiling benignly recall those circa-1957 agricultural filmstrips
we all had to watch in high school.

Gramm's page (http://www.gramm96.org/), in comparison, is a
relief. Despite the not-exactly-original American flag motif,
it loads more quickly than other pages, and offers a straightforward
menu of Gramm's stance on dozens of issues.

"You really want to avoid looking too blow-dried," says Berkeley
Internet Connections president Eric Davis, who designed Gramm's
page. "I sort of view the Internet as a place for scrappy young
men and women, and I designed the page to appeal to people
like me, 25-year-old political junkies who know a lot about
how the net works."

Actually, if you're looking for trenchant political commentary,
there are a few very witty sites to peruse-the many parody
pages satirizing the candidates. The best fake Dole page (http
//www.dole96.org/) is subtly wallpapered with Dole pineapple
can labels. Likewise, on one fake Buchanan page (http://www.buchanan96.org
) you'll find that the candidate allegedly opposes abortion
because "every fetus is a potential taxpayer. Each abortion
reduces the tax base of the federal government."

Some political consultants think candidates will remain cautious
about their online images. For one thing, there's no hard evidence
about who exactly reads these home pages and how the information
affects voters' opinions. That kind of feedback won't be gathered
until after November.

"How many voters can you reach? And how many net users look
at the political home sites in the next 90 days? Those are
the kinds of questions that need to be answered, because for
now the candidates still feel like they can probably reach
20 times more people with TV," says Joel Benenson, a political
consultant at Penn & Schoen, which conducts polls on behalf
of the Clinton campaign.

These points are undoubtedly true. But how many of these citizens
vote?

Michelle Slatalla recently completed a suspense thriller about
the Internet.

Net.Law

By:
Mark Eckenwiler

One of the wonderful things about cyberspace, generally speaking,
is that each of us can create a new persona.

Moreover, fanciful user names and the proliferation of anonymous
remailers let us interact with other denizens of the global
electronic village in near-total anonymity. In the future,
it seems, everyone will be anonymous for 15 minutes.

But while it may be true that (in the words of the now-famous
New Yorker cartoon) on the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,
the promise of anonymity also carries an undeniable downside.
For every CancelMoose performing the public service of canceling
Usenet spam, there's another equally anonymous (but far less
benign) poster-like the CancelPoodle, canceling articles that
criticize the Church of Scientology. It's surely the best known,
or more accurately, unknown offender.

The cluster of issues surrounding online identity and pseudonymity
provokes legal questions as well. And while U.S. courts have
had little opportunity to analyze the legal status of electronic
anonymity, the case of a disgruntled Ohio taxpayer's grassroots
protest sheds some helpful light on the First Amendment's protection
of anonymous speech.

At a 1988 public meeting, Margaret McIntyre expressed her opposition
to a proposed school-tax increase by handing out leaflets.
McIntyre signed some of these leaflets "Concerned Parents and
Taxpayers" instead of using her name. Although the flier contained
no false or libelous statements, McIntyre found herself the
object of unwelcome attention-and the recipient of a $100 fine
from the Ohio Elections Commission.

Her offense? She violated an Ohio election law that made it
illegal to circulate written materials endorsing or opposing
a candidate-or even a referendum issue-without the author's
name and address. While an Ohio trial court struck down the
fine, two state appellate courts (including the Ohio Supreme
Court) decided that the First Amendment did not protect McIntyre.

On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court voted overwhelmingly (7 to
2) to strike down the statute. Writing for six members of the
Court, Justice John Paul Stevens noted that "under our Constitution,
anonymous pamphleteering is not a pernicious, fraudulent practice,
but an honorable tradition of advocacy and of dissent It thus
exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights and of the
First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals
from retaliation-and their ideas from suppression-at the hand
of an intolerant society."

Even Justice Clarence Thomas, ordinarily not an overly zealous
defender of First Amendment rights, agreed with the outcome.
Thomas noted that the Federalist Papers themselves-issued under
the name "Publius"-are among the most famous pseudonymous works
in American history.

The McIntyre decision marked the culmination of a series of
Supreme Court cases that have found a right to anonymity under
the First Amendment. The Court laid the groundwork for this
modern trend in NAACP vs. Alabama (1958), holding that the
state of Alabama could not compel the NAACP to disclose its
membership list. The strong likelihood that doing so would
expose NAACP members to threats and retribution meant, in the
Court's view, that compelled disclosure would harm the members'
right to associate freely.

Two years later, the Supreme Court enlarged the scope of First
Amendment privacy in Talley vs. California. In that case, the
Court considered-and struck down-a Los Angeles ordinance prohibiting
the distribution of any anonymous leaflet, holding that a blanket
ban against anonymity violates the right to free speech under
the First Amendment.

The importance of McIntyre is that it took a much narrower law
one regulating only certain types of anonymous publications
(those advocating election causes)-and held it invalid under
the same rationale. Moreover, the reasoning in McIntyre and
its precursors applies directly to anonymity (and pseudonymity)
on the Internet.

Those who would attempt to ban anonymous e-mail or Usenet articles
often complain that such messages are of dubious worth without
author attribution. Internet service providers and online services
remain free to prohibit the sending of anonymous messages,
as a number of prominent private universities have attempted
to do. (These efforts have been largely in vain.) The McIntyre
decision, however, made it clear that a broad-based legal ban
on anonymous messages would not be shielded from constitutional
challenge.

Specifically, the majority view assesses the value of a real
signature, as opposed to a pseudonym. "In the case of a handbill
written by a private citizen who is not known to the recipient,
the name and address of the author adds little, if anything,
to the reader's ability to evaluate the document's message,"
says the Supreme Court. Moreover, as the Court observed in
a footnote, readers are not stupid. When they see an anonymous
or pseudonymous message, they can and will take its ambiguous
source into account when assessing its verity. This observation
is, of course, borne out a hundred times a day on Usenet, where
anonymous articles often meet with a skeptical reception.

According to their opponents, anonymous online messages facilitate
libel, fraud, and the sexual abuse of minors. (Indeed, last
year in an overwrought article attacking the use of anonymous
mail servers, the author of The Wall Street Journal's Personal
Technology column railed against each of these allegedly ubiquitous
problems.) What these critics often omit entirely, or give
short shrift to, are the positive aspects of anonymous speech.
With their identities unknown, political and ethnic minorities
under oppressive regimes can speak without fear of reprisal;
religious dissidents, whether criticizing a state-sponsored
religion or a vicious cult bent on harassing apostates, can
do likewise; and survivors of rape or sexual abuse can join
in anonymous online discussions.

The Supreme Court has recognized these beneficial uses. As the
justices observed in the Talley case, "anonymous pamphlets,
leaflets, brochures, and even books have played an important
role in the progress of mankind It is plain that anonymity
has sometimes been assumed for the most constructive purposes."

Moreover, the Court has adopted this rights-protective stance,
despite its recognition that anonymity can shield libel or
fraud. In both McIntyre and Talley, the Court freely conceded
that such misconduct may be punished appropriately. However,
the Court also has ruled that the First Amendment won't allow
blanket bans on anonymous speech-bans that would indirectly
punish such libelous or fraudulent offenses.

To be sure, anonymous speech may have some limitations placed
upon it. The McIntyre decision leaves open the possibility
that some narrower categories of anonymous speech could be
banned. A second, seemingly contradictory line of Supreme Court
cases upholds the power of the government to require disclosure
of the names of contributors to political campaigns. These
cases make it clear that even in the realm of political speech
at the core of First Amendment protections-the Court might
in the future endorse legislation narrowly targeted at anonymous
speech sponsored by campaign organizations.

In fact, the California Supreme Court did essentially that in
November 1994-before the McIntyre decision-when it upheld fines
imposed on Daniel Griset, a candidate for the Santa Ana, Calif.,
city council, for circulating pseudonymous fliers attacking
his opponent. The state court took pains to point out, however,
that its ruling did not address the constitutionality of banning
anonymous speech by individual citizens. The fact that the
U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal in Griset's case
five days after issuing the McIntyre decision suggests its
approval of this outcome.

Finally, it is useful to note what is not protected by McIntyre.
If an anonymous remailer keeps track of its users and their
pseudonyms, nothing would prevent a U.S. court from ordering
that information to be disclosed in a related lawsuit. Nothing,
that is, unless the remailer is outside the United States,
but even that's no guarantee of safety. Last February, Finnish
police forced the administrator of the best-known anonymous
server, anon.penet.fi, to reveal the identity of one of his
users. Preserving the legal right to anonymity is one thing;
preserving anonymity itself, evidently, is another matter entirely.@

Net. Stuff: Get a Leg Up on Life

By:

Highly responsible parents-the kind who serve up vocabulary

started first grade. But that's all changed: Now, cybersavvy
parents can get TeacherSoft Inc.'s InterGo and forget about
dusting all those books. With InterGo, Muffy can explore a
library, office, treasure map, or newsroom. When little Blake
clicks on, say, the encyclopedia on the reference bookshelf,
InterGo launches its browser, which connects to that "book"
at TeacherSoft's Web site. The youngsters can explore away,
with parents secure in knowing the software's KinderGuard feature
will prevent their innocents from viewing anything inappropriate.
For Windows 95 and 3.1, Macintosh version due early this year;

Net. Stuff: Memory Not What It Used to Be?

By:
Judith H. Bernstein, Gayle Isaacs, and Ted Stevenson

Don't worry, it's probably not you-or your computer. If you're
running Netscape Navigator with 14 helper apps, or Windows
95 with almost anything, operations can seem to take forever.
Short of popping in 32 MB of shiny new memory modules, what's
a net surfer to do? One answer is to invest $40 to $50 in Quarterdeck
Corp.'s MagnaRAM 2, a clever utility that tricks your computer
into thinking it's more than the sum of its parts. By replacing
Windows' virtual memory system and compressing portions of
RAM, MagnaRAM2 can reputedly increase your "apparent" RAM by
a factor of up to four. Two is more typical, though, and, as
they say, mileage will vary. 800-683-6696; http://www.quarterdeck.com

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: 3Com's ISDN Modem Has Major 
Internet Impact

By:
Daniel Scolnick

One of the first of the long-awaited personal ISDN communications
devices to appear on the market, 3Com Corp.'s Impact ISDN "modem"
is available for both the Macintosh and PC, with or without
V.32-compliant (14.4-Kbps) analog fax/modem capabilities. We
tested the IBM-compatible model 3C872 with a V.34 fax/modem,
which lists for $749. 3Com's digital-only models list for $549
each. Regardless of platform, all units incorporate both the
NT-1 terminal needed to make an ISDN connection and an analog
voice port for attaching phones, fax machines, and answering
machines to the ISDN line.

No-Sweat Setup

The 3Com Impact is easy to install: You simply attach it to
a serial port just like a standard modem. (3Com highly recommends
that IBM-compatible systems be equipped with a high-speed 16550
UART and run DOS 3.1 or later; Macs should use an 8-pin serial
port and System 7 or higher.) The straightforward Windows-based
setup and diagnostic software made short work of configuring
the unit. All procedures are simple and well-documented.

Net Speed

Using the Trumpet Winsock DLL and Netscape Navigator, we connected
to the Internet using both digital (ISDN) and analog (standard)
services. The Impact worked smoothly and seamlessly with whichever
connection we chose, but that's not to say that the results
were the same: With ISDN operating at full capacity, our connection
speed was more than four times that of a typical V.34 (28.8
Kbps) connection. Here's how it works.

Uses Two Channels

The Impact lets you use an ISDN line's two 64-Kbps "B" channels
("business channels") simultaneously-in a couple of different
ways. To achieve maximum Internet throughput, Multilink PPP
(a special variant of the serial Point to Point Protocol) can
effectively combine the two into a single connection of 128
Kbps capacity.

Then again, the built-in analog phone port lets you attach and
use a phone, fax machine, answering machine, or other telephony
device in tandem with an ISDN connection on the other channel.

In fact, a feature called dynamic bandwidth allocation lets
you place an analog phone call even while a Multilink PPP connection
is active.

We've waited close to 15 years for ISDN to become a reality.
If the 3Com Impact is any indication of what we can look forward
to, the wait will not have been in vain. While this hardware
is far from budget priced, what can we say? It works seamlessly,
giving us Internet connections beyond our wildest serial dreams.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Inside Track Turns 
CompuServe Into a Portfolio Manager

By:
Theresa W. Carey

MicroQuest, publisher of Inside Track investment software, has
a good idea: Take advantage of the commercial online provider
with the best services for personal investors and provide a
front end that tracks portfolio performance. First the positives
of this $49.95 Windows product:

The program is easy to use and has some online help built in,
though not a lot. You can set up as many portfolio groupings
as you'd like, and you can get reports on the performance of
each individually or of all your holdings together. When you
add a security to a portfolio, you have to work through several
dialog boxes that let you specify breakpoint-prices that will
generate an alert. Using a nifty feature, you can set the program
up to run even when you're not at your computer, and the alerts
can be programmed to beep your pager.

Inside Track taps into CompuServe Information Manager to get
you online; if you don't have CIM, you'll have to install it.

The program has some rough spots: If you want historical pricing,
you'll have to log on and download it one security at a time
not efficient. Resized windows revert to default size the next
time you open them-annoying. If you add an account while you
have the transaction register open, the new account doesn't
show up on the list until you close the register and open it
again-sloppy.

Inside Track has a lot of potential. It's not filled with technical
analysis bells and whistles, but it can give you well-formatted
basic information about your investments.

CompuServe members can GO QUEST to download an interactive demo.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Getting Serious About Page Design

By:
Joel T. Patz

Cruising the Internet these days is an eye-opening experience.
With new Web sites appearing daily and familiar sites changing
style, format and content, there's an unending variety of stimuli
clamoring for attention. To attract interest and increase visits
to your site, design a Web page to grab your viewer. How to
do this in today's increasingly complex technical environment
is the subject of Web Publisher's Design Guide for Macintosh
by Mary Jo Fahey, $34.99, published by The Coriolis Group.
(WPDG for Windows 95, co-written by Fahey and Jeff Brown, is
expected by the time you read this.)

Conceived to provide the graphic artist with tools to design
outstanding Web sites, this 416-page treasure trove of advice,
insight, practical instruction, and encouragement aims to do
away with guesswork. It uses Netscape Navigator, Quark XPress
and Photoshop as basic tools.

Opening chapters discuss Web navigation using both conventional
2-D controls and futuristic-looking 3-D controls that take
advantage of VRML and 3DMF (3D Meta File). You'll learn how
to work with images and how to manipulate the time it takes
to download them.

Extensive sections on photography, animation and 3-D graphics
explain the conventions of these media and the practical differences
between print and Web graphics. Emphasis is placed on learning
from existing Web pages and leveraging the advantages of various
image formats. Tips on digital photography, QuickTime VR, Apple's
QuickDraw 3D, and CGI (Common Gateway Interface) open new worlds
for Web designers.

Accompanied by a CD-ROM loaded with tools, templates, and examples,
Design Guide provides the essential practical side of the equation.
Inspiration completes it.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: Secure Wallet Stashes Cybercash

By:
Harry Hawk

CheckFree Corp. has entered the Internet commerce fray with
a software scheme for moving credit-card data securely across
the Internet. The system, CheckFree Wallet, feels secure, is
easy to set up, and is even easier to use. Best of all, it's
free.To get set up with Wallet, first download the software
(from http://www.mc2-csr.com/vmall/checkfree/v20/software.html).
This takes about five minutes using a 28.8-Kbps modem. Then
connect to CheckFree and configure the application by registering
your name or "persona." Next, establish a password and input
the credit cards you plan to use. This one-time process might
take up to 30 minutes, but with signup out of the way, making
purchases will be far quicker than ordering through an 800
number.

Wallet works only for transactions with merchants who've adopted
the system themselves. For a listing of these merchants, point
your browser at http://www.mc2csr.com/vmall/checkfree/v20/wmalls.html.
When we checked this site early in November, only about a dozen
merchants were online, but more will be coming soon.

With Wallet, your credit-card data is never stored on the merchant's
Web site, so there's nothing online for hackers to steal.

Visit CheckFree's Web site at http://www.checkfree.com/ for
system requirements and a listing of compatible browsers. The
system currently runs on Windows and will soon run on Macs.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: From One Pipe, Many Connections

By:
William Wong

Ascend's $895 Pipeline 25 is an ISDN Ethernet router designed
for small offices and home offices (SOHO). Routers exchange
data transparently between local area networks (LANs) and remote
networks over phone lines. Thus they can connect LANs in physically
separate offices or-much more likely in the SOHO context-connect
a LAN to the Internet, giving everyone on the LAN a high-speed
net connection.

ISDN service consists not of a single digital line transferring
data at 128 Kbps, but of two 64-Kbps "B" channels that can
be used individually for data or voice connections. You can
plug phones, modems, or fax machines into the Pipeline 25 and
use them for both incoming and outgoing calls-one B channel
per call. The Pipeline 25 can even accept incoming calls when
both B channels are already in use. It simply drops one data
channel, allowing the new call to ring the phone. This gives
a single ISDN line the potential to support a small office's
entire voice and data load.

Setting up the Pipeline 25 and getting an ISDN account can be
tedious, but Ascend and ISPs like PSINet (Herndon, Va., 800
827-7482) can handle much of this for you. PSINet even sells
the Pipeline 25 at a substantial discount ($700) when setting
up a LAN account, which offers unlimited connect time at about
$250 per month.

Ascend's data compression option ($300) potentially ups Pipeline's
transmission speed to 512 Kbps when it's connected to a similarly
equipped router. For further information, contact Ascend Communications
Inc., Alemeda, Calif., 800-621-9578, http://www.ascend.com.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: A Scanner That's No Scam

By:
Joel T. Patz

It took us only five minutes to get the PaperPort Vx from Visioneer
installed and working. Adding this amazing 12- by 2.5- by 3.75
inch scanner to your arsenal of equipment will revolutionize
how you work. Feeding a document into this highly compact unit
turns it on and launches the software; before you know it-in
less than 10 seconds-an image of your document is on screen,
ready for you to work with.

The PaperPort's setup program automatically creates icons that
let it work with any of more than 100 popular applications.
To fax a document, for example, just drag it to the fax icon;
PaperPort launches your fax program and converts the document
to fax format. Drag a scanned document to the OCR icon and
it's converted into an editable file.

The quality of PaperPort's scans is quite good for general-purpose
work and can be adjusted. You can clean up documents, straighten,
trim, and crop. Special technology called SharpPage minimizes
the effects of colored backgrounds.

The Annotation Tool Bar lets you add sticky notes, fill in preprinted
forms, draw freehand and add arrows. And you can organize GIF,
JPEG, PCX and BMP files that you download from the Internet
or other online services on the "Desktop."

Included with PaperPort are PictureWorks Copier, which lets
you enlarge and reduce scanned images and adjust brightness
and contrast, and CardScan, which turns business cards into
editable database records.

PaperPort Vx's estimated street price is $369. For more information,
call Visioneer at 800-787-7007.

Net.Results--New tools for online denizens: This Modem Means Business

By:
Joel T. Patz

There are scads of modems out there these days, but no matter
how we use them, we all want speed and high performance. The
new Hayes Optima 228 Business Modem fulfills both criteria
and more. The advantages of data, fax, and voice capabilities
in one box won't escape power users or those just looking for
something better.

Using the latest enhanced v.42bis data-compression, Optima 228
can send and receive at throughput rates up to 230.4 Kbps.
And we had no problems connecting to Internet service providers
and America Online at its highest transmission rate, 28.8 Kbps,
over standard phone lines. It's fast.

The Smartcom Message Center LE and Modem Manager software included
with the Optima turn your computer into a professional answering
service that can distinguish voice from data and fax calls,
maintain as many as 10 mailboxes, and supply fax on-demand.

If you have Caller ID and/or Distinctive Ring, this system supports
them. You can password-protect voice messages and faxes, and
Optima 228 supports dial-back security.

Indicator LEDs adorn the front of this low-profile unit. A voice
data button and small speaker are located on top, microphone
and speaker jacks on the right side. The on/off switch, power,
serial port, line, and phone connectors are on the back. A
modem cable accompanies the Macintosh model, but PC users will
have to supply their own modem cables.

Good stuff like this isn't cheap: Optima 228's sleek performance
and first-class features will cost you $579. For more information,
call 770-840-9200 or visit http://www.hayes.com/.

Web 2000--We Show You Tomorrow's Net Today

By:
Karen Heyman

It's Jan. 2, 2000. You're finally starting to recover after
having stayed up all night to participate in a Virtual World
party, after which even your avatar felt hung over. As you
stumble to the bathroom, you trip over that pile of computer
magazines you've been intending to read, and you see NetGuide's
"Web 2000" cover. For a moment, you're foggy enough to think
you're behind in your reading by only a month. Then suddenly,
horribly, you realize just how long that pile's been stacked
up-because nobody has used the term "Web" for years. - What
will the Web be like in four years? John Fleming, a medievalist
and former chairman of the English Department at Princeton
University, looks back for inspiration in predicting the future.
"I see it as a dramatic extension of something that's already
happened-the invention of movable type" Fleming says.

The invention of movable type changed the world as it was then
known. It disseminated academic knowledge and transformed a
predominantly oral culture-in which scholars memorized entire
books-into a literate one. The combination of the 15th century's
invention of the printing press and the 16th century's translation
of the Latin bible into vernacular languages led to the Protestant
Reformation. Given these examples of the Law of Unintended
Consequences, it's safe to say that as far as the Web is concerned,
we still don't know what we have here. And we won't for at
least another generation.

A Clear Technical Sight

Ironically, the technological path of the Web is somewhat easier
to determine than its cultural impact. Espousing a preference
for "seamless applications," everyone from Tim Berners-Lee
to Microsoft marketers forecast that we'll connect directly
to the net. No longer will we be stuck in the kludgy four-step
process of open application on hard drive, log on to ISP, search
the Web for data to place into an application, manually place
data in application.

As Berners-Lee explains, "People will not have to concern themselves
with where things are stored, whether [they're] on a local
or remote disk, for example. All one will do is specify the
speed and reliability you need for access to a copy of a document,
and the machine will decide, in negotiation with other machines,
where to keep copies.

"The desktop and the Web browser should become one," Berners
Lee continues. "The folder, hotlist, and hypertext document
objects will all become objects that you can change, drag things
into, publish, and send to people." And, he says, the appearance
of objects on screen "will depend less on what software you
have bought shrink-wrapped and more on where you have been
browsing recently. As you browse, your computer will acquire
the software it needs to interact with the information you
are using.

"The important things will be: who has access to an object,
how fast, and how reliably," he says. "I might see a news article
and say to the system, 'save that,' meaning 'ensure I have
rapid and reliable access to that until I tell you otherwise.'
The system will decide how many copies to keep where. We shouldn't
be aware of file names in five years' time."

This also explains why you're reading an article entitled "Web
2000." The Internet as we currently know it, divided by application
software into distinct areas, like IRC and Usenet, will continue
to merge through extensions to Web protocols into one seamless
multimedia something. The closest thing that "something" will
bear resemblance to is the Web.

Web designer David Siegel, one of whose pages was a runner-up
for Cool Site of the Year, suggests that by 2000, we probably
won't even call it the Web, or even say "I'm going to go on
the Web." Consider the awkward phrases used when PCs were born
 "I'm going to do my paper on the computer" now sounds as redundant
as "I'm going to watch Babylon 5 on television."

The Web already has split into professional and amateur sites,
a gap that is likely to widen as HTML becomes increasingly
complicated and programmer-only tools-like Sun Microsystems'
Java-come online. Adobe's Acrobat and Netscape's tables have
only just begun to make the Web an attractive environment for
top graphic designers. As more artists design for the Web,
the visual sophistication of professional Web sites will increase.
As a result, amateur sites may start to look more and more
"homemade" by comparison.

OK, so maybe we can't make any grand proclamations about the
Web's impact on world culture until the 2030s. But until then,
there's a great deal of history to be made. Here, in the fields
of education, media, politics, and law and commerce, we depict
some of the changes instant worldwide distribution can bring
about.

Law and Commerce

The cobwebs are taking longer to leave your brain, as they have
ever since 1998, when caffeine became a controlled substance.
Desperate for a hit of Jolt, now only available by prescription,
you sit down at the keyboard of your NetBox and say "Tijuana,"
since you're in no shape for typing. Once inside the virtual
Mexican pharmacy, you see that they moved the Jolt. "Bring
me to Jolt," you mutter. A quick digital cash-card swipe through
the keyboard's built-in slot, and in a few hours, UPS makes
a no-questions-asked, same-day delivery.

Law and commerce have frequently met in many a cultural analysis,
but they are practically inextricable on the net. We've chosen
to combine these topics because so many of those we interviewed
did. There's a growing feeling that Internet commerce will
thrive-that is, if it isn't regulated out of existence.

The good news is that an estimated $7.2 billion online marketplace
will exist by 2000, according to Jupiter Communications' 1996
"Home Shopping Report." ($4.5 billion Web-based, $2.7 proprietary
online services.) But right now, some very ominous threats
hail from Washington. Says Mike Godwin of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation: [They] "are afraid of this new medium. The federal
government is afraid of digital cash, since the FBI has increasingly
relied on traceable transactions. Anti-pornographers like [Edwin]
Meese want to make distributors of online information liable
for that information."

Thus, ISPs can be held liable in their legal role as publishers.
For example, The WELL would be at risk simply for admonishing
people not to discuss Pentiums on a Macintosh forum. "Do we
want laws that force services into one or the other?" Godwin
asks. One solution is to try to define ISPs and proprietary
providers as "distributors," like bookstores and libraries.
"If NetGuide publishes libel, you can't sue Barnes & Noble,"
Godwin says. "Yet a mystery bookstore can make the editorial
decision not to sell science fiction."

The greatest unresolved online issue linking law and commerce
is copyright. The National Writers Union and the Writers Guild
of America are concerned about what ease of distribution (as
in information for sale online) will do to copyright law. However,
Lance Rose, an attorney who specializes in online law, won't
be a digital vendor for now: "I don't have my book up there,"
he says. Among the growing number of proposed answers to the
problem are digital payments, a proposal that makes the electronic
commerce crowd very happy. In fact, one writer has signed up
with NetCheque, one such digital payment system.

At IBM's infoMarket Internet division, Jeff Crigler, vice president
and managing director, describes the service's own solution
to the copyrights-in-commerce issue. "We were focused on the
wrong problem. It wasn't copying. It was payment assurance."
To remedy the problem, IBM has created what it calls "cryptolopes,"
encrypted capsules of information which require a recipient
to pay for data electronically before accessing it. This ensures
that the copyright holder keeps receiving payment whenever
material is re-distributed. A cryptolope functions as sort
of digital shrink-wrap-your browser can decrypt it, but every
time you send it on, "the price tag stays on it" and it must
be decrypted again-and paid for-by whomever you send it to.

Nevertheless Crigler admits, cryptolopes can make bootlegging
"very hard, but [not] impossible." He can easily see Southeast
Asian bootleggers distributing CD-ROMs of downloaded music
and videos. To help law enforcement, IBM also is working on
a digital watermark that will encode the address of the original
recipient into the material.

Politics

The NetBox has its advantages-it's always on, just like telephones
used to be, and the little dumb terminal was cheap. OK, it
was 500 bucks, but that's still less than the money you spent
on an ISDN card alone back in the '90s. Staring at the flat
panel screen, you marvel that anonymous electronic payment
has survived this long. Your thoughts are interrupted by a
Mary Hart-like blonde. "Remember to disable auto-avatars,"
you think, as she chirps on about your party's new campaign.
Funny, she looks an awful lot like the blonde the president
denied having sex with in that now-famous videoconference.

Call the White House press office to get a quote on the future
of the Web in politics and guess what? They'll tell you to
fax that request. Such moped-like activity from the folks who
stuck us with the term "information superhighway" notwithstanding,
Steven Singer of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government
is optimistic. He suggests we will see candidates reaching
much more directly to the electorate in 2000 by campaigning
to online communities, in much the same way they discovered
talk shows in the 1992 elections. Candidates might even circumvent
television's sound bites: Imagine a candidate saying, "No New
Taxes-See www.me.org!"

But if there is a greater opportunity for unfiltered communication,
the downside for candidates, says David King, also of the Kennedy
School, is that candidates lose wiggle room for issues that
weren't anticipated during the campaign. "If you can go and
find online transcripts, there's a direct comparison that tends
to become binding," King says. A further downside for the candidates
is that political reporters can go straight to the people,
too. Now, instead of printing just one or two damaging quotes,
entire documents can be placed in front of the world. Award
winning investigative reporter Steve Pizzo is already doing
just that over at Web Review (http://gnn.com/wr/)

Meanwhile, over at the Democratic National Committee, one very
wired Democrat has some thoughts on how to use the Web for
organizing. Dick Bell, the committee's interactive media specialist,
started out in the trenches-literally (he used to dig the holes
for candidates' lawn signs). Granted, nobody wants junk e-mail
coming from candidates, but he suggests that you can run listservs
from candidates' Web sites-it would be voluntary and non-intrusive.
"You can think of things for people to do sitting where they
are. If people don't have to drive to meetings, you can broaden
the base of who gets involved. If you go to a campaign office
now, you'll only see students and senior citizens. We could
finally include more working parents," Bell says.

The availability of Java and VRML likely will mean many simulations
could be run either by campaigns or online newspapers. Should
you vote for that new bond issue to expand the freeways? The
Los Angeles Times Web site could let you experience "before"
and "after" traffic congestion. Meanwhile, the downside of
such multimedia tools is obvious: It becomes even easier to
fudge data in a simulation.

Although it is unlikely to happen by 2000, one of the current
blue-sky dreams is electronic democracy. The biggest stumbling
block is that it would be too easy-for some of the population.
The concern is that election results could be skewed by those
who had to do nothing more in the middle of a freak early November
blizzard than sit down at their keyboards. Yet, we may still
see an even more divided electorate, split between those who
get their information from TV sound bites, and those who will
be able to read everything available about the issues on the
Web.

Education

Happy day! UPS just showed up. Ahhh, warm Jolt and cold pizza,
a nice traditional breakfast to start the new millennium. NetBox,
ShmetBox-that first hit has you pumped for some serious hardware.
Like that Intel P9 box you gave yourself for Christmas that's
got more power than a Cray, and weighs less than those clunky
old laptops. Synched to your 3-D video projectors, it's perfect
for entering the University Bio Lab and finishing your project
telerobotically-or knocking off a round of Doom 2000.

Secondary schools in Watchung, N.J., have wired all their classrooms,
teachers receive all their daily memos by e-mail, and parents
are clamoring to have all those permission slips and PTA notices
e-mailed home. Students in Princeton, N.J., are required to
complete a multimedia project in order to graduate-from sixth
grade. But Watchung and Princeton residents have some of the
highest per capita incomes in the country. In a country that
still bases most public school funding on property taxes, poor
communities will continue to lag behind. Even middle-class
communities feel it: Green Brook, N.J., which borders Watchung,
considered wiring its school system, until somebody actually
multiplied the cost of putting only one $2,000 PC in each classroom
in the district.

At a public meeting of the Advisory Council on the National
Information Infrastructure, the biggest question from the audience
wasn't access to the Internet-it was access to computers. Period.
Now, Compaq recently announced it will create a $500 box with
net access. Perhaps by 2000, it will actually exist. But even
at that price, it will be beyond the reach of many families.
Perhaps they will be able to rent dumb terminals connected
to servers as we once rented telephones, and be charged for
downloaded applications on a per-minute basis. Perhaps.

The situation is further complicated by infrastructure. The
only wiring in most American classrooms exists to turn on the
light switch. Yet there is optimism on the horizon. In October,
President Clinton called for "a high-tech barn raising" with
a four-point set of goals:

 Modern computers will be accessible to every student.

 Classrooms will be connected to one another and to the outside
world.

 Teachers will be ready to use and teach technology.

 Educational software will be an integral part of the curriculum.
Not surprisingly, it is expected that most of these goals will
be met with private-sector help. The president cited the state
of California, where by the end of the school year, all K-12
schools will have access to the Internet. He was referring
to Pacific Bell's Education First initiative.

Most encouraging of all is the creation of Tech Corps, a Peace
Corps for the '90s, according to its founder, Gary J. Beach.
Tech Corps seeks to enlist technical professionals as volunteers
to wire America's classrooms to further the spread of computer
literacy. Information about Tech Corps can be found on its
Web site (http://www.ustc.org)

Media

The caffeine has hit optimum cruising speed through your veins,
and you really should be working. But you're having too much
fun flirting with the other players and the professional characters
writers on Star Trek: A Generation of Deeply Spaced Voyagers.
Thank goodness for the simultaneous translation, which is helping
you get to know that girl from France. Oh, no! Now some nerd's
insisting on speaking Klingonese to her. Sigh. Some things
never change.

Dr. Clifford Neuman, an expert in authentication and creator
of the NetCheque system of digital payment, sits in his office
at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences
Institute. He views The Spot (http://www.thespot.com), an online
narrative site often likened to an Aaron Spelling TV show,
for the first time, and comments, "The Web phenomenon is very
much not the technologist's phenomenon but what the artists
did with the phenomenon. If I were asked 10 years ago, could
you use TCP/IP to send images like this, certainly the answer
was clearly yes. But if I'd been asked, 'Is this what we should
be doing with it?" he laughs. "I wouldn't have anticipated
this!"

Neither did Hollywood. Berners-Lee sums up the media's myopia

After the phrase "Interactive Television" in a correspondent's .sig 
file, he types, "an oxymoron surely. :-)" Hollywood producers
are now trying to make up for lost time, and by the time you
read this, any number of sites will have been approached and
deals made-or more likely, fallen through.

"I don't see the level of vision and commitment. I think a number
of them still feel it's going to be cable," says Guy Morris
of Cracks in the Web (http://www.cybertown.com/cybertown/cracks.html),
referring to Hollywood's persistent belief that a TV with a
set-top box will be the device of the future. "But they feel
that they should be doing something. The market is going to
get ahead of them, but they can always jump in once the market
is mature."

For Web creators, and for traditional Hollywood types, ambitions
lie in two directions. A Web site can be a relatively low-cost
way to try out new ideas for an episodic television series.
Previously, there was no other way to do that than to spend
millions to put a show on the air, and to hope for the best.
Now a cast and plotlines can be road-tested before a network
makes a major investment. Without revealing details, Scott
Zakarin, one of the creators of The Spot, confesses, "We see
doing this type of thing as lab work. [Hollywood] production
companies are talking to us about it all over the place."

Push The E-mail Envelop--It's the single most popular service
on the net-the universal application. But are you getting all
you should out of Internet e-mail?

By:
KEVIN REICHARD

How quickly we forget. Most Internet users-especially those
of us who have logged a zillion hours on the net-simply take
e-mail for granted. We've lost that sense of wonder and excitement
at the magic of messages that circle the globe in seconds.

It's a shame, since e-mail is the universal Internet service
the one that provided the initial impetus for the net's creation
and is still the most popular single online activity.

But the real bottom line is that many of us don't take full
advantage of the capabilities of Internet e-mail. We think
we're cool when we quote an original message in a reply or
attach a file to a message from time to time. But there's much
more to today's Internet e-mail. It's not a static technology;
it's evolving all the time. And you can find plenty of affordable
e-mail client software packages out there that can widen your
e-mail horizons-particularly the ones highlighted in this feature.

Great Expectations

What should you expect from an up-to-date e-mail package? For
starters, a well-organized user interface that doesn't require
a lot of time and effort to master. But that's just the beginning,
the sine qua non. Here's a list of important features that
good e-mail software provides:

Signatures: Signatures let you automatically affix a file or
text tag to every outgoing message. Multiple signatures are
nice because they allow you to attach one signature, say, to
your work messages and another to your "play" messages. And
there's no rule that says signatures have to be text-Emissary,
for example, lets you attach a GIF or JPEG file as your signature.
(If you think those florid 30-line signatures are bad, wait
until everyone starts attaching their photos to their outgoing
mail. Oooh, that shrinking bandwidth!)

Address books: Address books should allow you to store both
individual Internet users and groups or "mailing lists." A
really good Internet mail package will automatically add addresses
from incoming mail to your address book.

Attachments: Attachments-at least Internet mail attachments
actually are formatted to be part of the mail message, though
they appear separate to the end user. The most popular attachment
format is MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension). A mail
package that supports MIME translates a binary file into text,
putting markers at the beginning and the end of the text. The
beginning marker contains the name of the file and the specific
type of attachment (there are MIME types for audio, binary
program files, text, and more). When a mail package receives
a message with a MIME-formatted attachment, it translates the
text back into a binary file, stores it with the file name
specified in the marker (usually while giving you the chance
to specify a new file name), and displays the name of the file
as well as its size and an icon representing its originating
application.

Two other attachment formats are in common use, both similar
to MIME. BinHex is popular in the Macintosh world, but not
well-supported in the Windows and Unix worlds. Most of the
mail packages we review also support uuencode/uudecode, an
older format still widely used in the Unix world.

Inbox/outbox: Inboxes and outboxes are de rigueur for e-mail,
of course. But a single inbox for storing accumulated messages
just doesn't cut it today. You should be able to easily create
multiple mailboxes or folders, the metaphor used by most packages.
This lets you keep all work-related messages in one box, for
example, and all personal messages in another. A really up
to-date package like Quarterdeck Messaging Center allows folders
within folders, so you can store messages in a hierarchical
fashion.

Filtering/routing: Filtering or routing lets you set up rules
for dealing automatically with incoming messages. These rules
typically key off of the subject line or some part of the address
(To:, From:, Cc:), sometimes even the message text. The range
of actions that can be carried out depends on the individual
package, though most packages with this feature at least let
you route incoming mail to a specified folder based on message
contents. For example, all mail from your boss could be routed
to your ReadFirst folder. Some of the packages add to this
capability. Eudora Pro, for instance, lets you change or create
a new subject line to both incoming and outgoing mail automatically,
or send a stock reply ("I'm on vacation," for example) to every
incoming message.

Universal mailbox: Universal mailboxes let you retrieve mail
in one place from several different sources besides the Internet.
We review two such products: E-Mail Connection (for Windows)
and Claris E-Mailer (for Macintosh)

What We Reviewed

In this roundup, we didn't attempt to look at every available
Internet e-mail package. Rather, we chose products that are
both affordable and worth your serious consideration. This
means software priced at less than $100 that provides a reasonably
complete selection of up-to-date e-mail capabilities, both
basic and advanced. (There are some first-rate corporate-style
TCP/IP mail packages-Z-Mail, for example-that sell for upwards
of $300 a pop.) Our list includes both Macintosh and Windows
applications, and one that runs under DOS as well. (The Windows
apps all run under Windows 3.1 and Win95.)

To use any of these packages, you'll need a direct connection
to the Internet, either through a dial-up SLIP or PPP account
(using accompanying software, such as Trumpet Winsock or MacTCP)
or a direct network connection. Some of these packages, such
as Emissary or Quarterdeck InternetSuite, contain the software
needed to make this connection, but most don't.

You'll also need an account on an Internet mail server that
runs either POP3 or IMAP. (The server is where your incoming
mail is stored.) IMAP is the newer of the two protocols and
offers some advanced features (both for users and system administrators)
that POP3 and the older POP2 do not. (For example, with an
IMAP server, you can choose to leave mail on the server or
download it to your local system, whereas with POP servers,
all mail is downloaded automatically when you log on.) None
of the packages we review is written specifically to take advantage
of the IMAP protocol, though all work just fine with IMAP servers,
since there's backward compatibility between IMAP and POP3.
Your service provider or system administrator may provide you
with two e-mail addresses: a POP3 or IMAP server for incoming
mail, and an SMTP server for outgoing mail. Very often, though,
these two addresses will be the same.

And speaking of service providers, some of the publishers of
packages we review here, most notably Quarterdeck Corp., have
arrangements with service providers that simplify or eliminate
many of the configuration problems encountered in connecting
directly to the Internet.

So, peruse the reviews that follow, and see our sidebars on
free e-mail ["Internet Free-Mail," page 74] and mail service
provided by commercial online services ["The Online Service
Connection," page 66], and set yourself up to get the most
out of this wonderful resource-one of the 20th century's great
contributions to communication. Oh, and don't forget to drop
us an e-mail (netmail@netguide.cmp.com). It is, after all,
ridiculously easy and inexpensive.

Claris E-Mailer

Claris E-Mailer 1.0.2 is a universal e-mail inbox, for the Macintosh
only, with links to the Internet, America Online, CompuServe,
eWorld, and RadioMail. Claris E-Mailer works from a dial-up
Internet connection (in this case, using MacTCP) to check for
messages.

Perhaps the most compelling reason to look at Claris E-Mailer
is its simplicity. You won't drown in a sea of confusing configuration
options when dealing with E-Mailer, and you'll appreciate the
tidy interface. All of E-Mailer's elements (inbox, outbox,
filing cabinet, address book) are organized by tabs in a single
browser-style interface. Moving between elements is simply
a matter of clicking the tabs.

Once you've mastered the interface, you've pretty much mastered
E-Mailer. To sort your messages, you click a column; the sorting
is keyed to the entries in that column. Click the Date column,
for instance, and the entries will appear in the order they
were received. You can sort in ascending or descending order.

The address book is similarly easy to use. You can set up both
individual and group addresses. Addresses are presented in
a single list, regardless of source (Internet, AOL, etc.).
If your address list is long, you can use the Filter feature
to locate an address by typing in the first few letters of
a name. Once you've located the desired address, you can either
create a pre-addressed message or drag and drop the address
into the message space.

E-Mailer also can be set up to process incoming mail automatically
based on the contents of the message. For instance, E-Mailer
automatically could forward all messages from a particular
correspondent to your assistant. While you're on vacation,
E-Mailer can send an "I'm on vacation" response to all incoming
messages.

And, of course, there are the things that Internet mail junkies
would expect, such as MIME attachments, quoted replies, and
automatic signatures.

For Mac-based net surfers who want an easy-to-use Internet mail
package, E-Mailer is a good choice-you'll be up and running
in no time, and with the program's powerful routing feature,
you can make sure your mail always gets delivered to the right
place.

or better, System 7.0 or better, 1.5 MB of RAM); $80; 800-544

E-Mail Connection 3.0

Once you become more than a dabbler in the online world, you
quickly tire of switching between software packages to retrieve
your mail from the several services you inevitably find yourself
using. You writhe in despair at tracking down messages saved
among different mail packages.

That's why ConnectSoft's E-Mail Connection 3.0-the original
universal mail package-is such a powerful tool for busy Windows
based e-mail users. In addition to handling Internet mail,
it lets you send and receive mail via such services as CompuServe,
MCI Mail, America Online, and Prodigy, and/or over a local
area network using any of the popular transport protocols.
You even can use E-Mail Connection to handle your faxes.

This not only makes e-mail easy to get at, it makes mail usage
transparent to end users; you don't need to think about which
mail system you're interacting with. When E-Mail Connection
logs on to the Internet and downloads your Internet e-mail,
it's automatically sent to your inbox along with all other
incoming mail. (This is mostly a blessing, but also a minor
curse: It would be great to be able to set up multiple inboxes
and route mail to them depending on who sent it or where it
came from.) The same holds for replies: The sender's electronic
address is logged in E-Mail Connection's address book automatically,
and your reply just goes there.

E-Mail Connection compares favorably with any of the dedicated
packages reviewed here. It handles all the basic functions,
such as managing MIME file attachments, with aplomb. (For example,
a received message clearly shows all attachments by file name,
file size, and originating application.) And if you're working
with a lot of mail, you'll appreciate the advanced search capabilities.
You can search through a specific folder or all folders, seek
messages from a specific source or all e-mail sources, and
look for specific text strings in the text or the Subject field.
Finally, it's one of the few packages to offer sophisticated
message security-in this case, RSA encryption.

As for price, E-Mail Connection just makes our cutoff for affordable
Internet e-mail. But if you work a lot with e-mail from multiple
sources, you'll find that it's worth every penny. (Alternatively,
you can grab the free Version 2.5.03 of E-Mail Connection,
scaled down for Internet-only usage, from ConnectSoft's Web
site.)

better); $99.95; 800-234-9497; fax: 206-822-9095; http://www.connectsoft.com

Emissary

Emissary 1.00 from The Wollongong Group Inc. is like a Volkswagen
Beetle that's been outfitted with the cockpit of a Boeing 747
 There's a lot of control provided for what is essentially
a simple task, but it's the perfect setup for those who are
into precision flying.

The design philosophy behind Emissary is clear-that the distinctions
among the Web, mail, and news are mostly artificial, and that
most users would benefit from software that combines these
functions into a unified interface. By and large, this approach
succeeds, but it makes for a rather busy interface-hence the
Beetle/747 comparison.

To begin with, the modest downside of this design philosophy
 First, you have to wade through a lot of interface to get
at your mail, and second, if you're already committed to another
Web browser or newsreader, it simply may not be worth the effort
to bring Emissary onstage just for e-mail.

If the interface doesn't turn you off, though, there's a lot
to like about Emissary's holistic approach to the Internet.
All the basics are here, some executed with flair. For example,
there's a well-designed address book, complete with alias and
mailing list capabilities. If you have a lot of messages, Emissary
lets you search through them efficiently.

Other, more advanced tools can make your life even easier. These
include the automatic message filter, which can route messages
from a particular sender or with a specified subject to the
folder of your choice. You also can exercise extensive control
over how Emissary interacts with your mail server, even to
the point of specifying the lengths of timeouts if the server
fails to respond to various portions of a communications session.

There's even a diagnostic function that lists the version numbers
of your various Emissary resource files (or DLLs), a feature
that will be handier in the future as more advanced versions
of Emissary are made available.

Emissary is one of those e-mail software packages that's in
your face, challenging you to get the most out of it. And even
though you might be confused, even annoyed, by the interface
when you first encounter it, you'll find it's well worth mastering.

The Wollongong Group Inc.; Emissary 1.00 (requires Windows 3.1
or better, 386-based PC or better, 4 MB of RAM); $99; 800-872
8649; fax: 415-962 0286; http://www.twg.com

Eudora

Available in both Windows and Macintosh versions, Qualcomm Inc.'s
Eudora is probably the single most popular Internet e-mail
package among PC users.

A note here about Eudora's several versions: Eudora Pro is the
commercial software; Eudora Light is freely distributed by
Qualcomm Inc. at ftp.qualcomm.com and is also bundled by Netscape
Communications in its Netscape Navigator Personal Edition.
Eudora Light lacks a number of important features-such as spell
checking-that are found in Eudora Pro. Incidentally, the Macintosh
and Windows versions of Eudora are identical in both the Light
and Pro versions.

A quick tour of Eudora Pro shows why it's so popular: Installation
is a breeze. All you need to do is enter your server addresses
and your own user information. To create mail, you select New
Message and enter the appropriate addressing information (recipient,
any carbon copies, subject). If you want, you can specify a
file to be attached, and you have your choice of MIME, BinHex
(popular in the Macintosh world) or uuencode (popular in the
Unix world) formats. You also have a choice of signatures,
as Eudora supports both main and alternative signature files.
When you're done writing your mail, Eudora Pro brings up its
spelling checker and the completed message is then shipped
automatically to a mail server. Eudora will check your mail
server at regular intervals if you like, but you also can elect
to check on the spur of the moment. In addition, you can set
up Eudora Pro to route mail to specific folders, so that you
can, for instance, send all messages from your significant
other to your personal folder.

So what would make Eudora Pro perfect? For starters, a better
search mechanism, as Eudora Pro allows only for simple text
searches, and does not provide wildcards or allow you to winnow
down search criteria (such as searching only through the inbox)

If and when Qualcomm makes this improvement, it will be welcome.
Meanwhile, Eudora Pro is about as good as it gets in the Internet
e-mail world, in both its commercial and freeware incarnations
so good that you probably won't even mind the less-than-stellar
search tools.

Qualcomm Inc.; Eudora Pro 2.1.2 (requires Windows 3.1 or better,
Mac Plus or better, System 7 or better); $80; 619-587-1121;
fax: 619-452-9096; http://www.qualcomm.com/

NetShark 1.0.4

Integrating a Web browser with a mail module makes perfect sense,
as these are the two most heavily used Internet services. That's
the philosophy behind InterCon Systems Corp.'s NetShark 1.0.4,
available by download in both Windows 3.1 and Macintosh versions
which, though not identical in organization and interface details,
do offer similar features. (Be warned that this product is
updated frequently. Even as NetGuide went to press, new versions
were being posted on InterCon's Web site.)

NetShark's mail/browser integration is complete on the Mac:
To access the mail functions, you simply choose Mailbox while
in the Web browser, whereupon you can send and receive mail.
Under Windows, however, NetShark Mail and WebShark (the Web
browser) are separate, but linked, applications.

In either case, once you get to the mail package, you'll find
that NetShark Mail is a pretty complete offering. The important
Internet mail tools, like signature files and MIME attachments,
are all supported. You can sort your messages by a number of
criteria, such as date, order received, status, and subject.
And the package has some fairly advanced search tools. For
instance, you can search for all messages that either do or
don't contain a specific text string, and you can use the *
and ? wildcards to expand your search.

NetShark also provides a sophisticated set of automated processing
actions that can be applied to mail. For instance, you can
use wildcards (*) or other expressions to expand or narrow
a criterion that triggers an action. These actions can involve
automatically filing messages to specific folders, deleting
messages, or marking them as read. About the only function
it can't perform is respond automatically to every incoming
message when you're away or on vacation (a feature that Claris
E-Mailer offers)

For Mac users, NetShark is a powerful, easy-to-use mail package
that easily rivals anything else on the market. For Windows
users, the integration of mail and Web browser is a hard one
to pass up-considering the many amenities NetShark Mail offers.

Pegasus Mail

One of the neatest things about the Internet is seeing the contributions
that individuals have made to the community at large. A good
example is David Harris' creation, Pegasus Mail 2.10, which
comes in Windows, Macintosh, and DOS versions. Not only is
P-Mail a first-rate product, it's free, and Harris keeps it
up to date by regularly releasing new and more powerful versions.
You have to order the manual (for a reasonable cost), and technical
support is offered via e-mail.

Free products are inherently attractive, but P-Mail's popularity
ultimately rests on the fact that it's a pretty darn good piece
of software. Designed to run in both the Internet and Novell
NetWare environments, P-Mail has lots of power when it comes
to configuration and usage, offering features like mail filtering
(you can route all messages from Bill Clinton to a folder called
President, for instance), advanced configuration options (like
not automatically downloading mail that exceeds a certain size),
and more standard features such as signature files, spelling
checker, and quoted replies. You can choose your favorite method
of encoding outgoing attachments; MIME, uuencode, and BinHex
are all supported. It even lets you encrypt mail for better
security-still an unusual capability.

P-Mail also has a unique feature called noticeboard, which is
akin to a low-rent Lotus Notes-type bulletin board on a local
area network. With noticeboard, users can add comments to a
threaded conversation, and discussions can be nested within
other conversations. Noticeboard discussions are organized
in the same manner as mail folders, so users can switch between
them easily.

Unfortunately, P-Mail's power is hidden behind some very unhelpful
icons and a sometimes-confusing organization. Also, you'll
want to know at least a little about how networking and Internet
mail work before you tackle a P-Mail configuration. Still,
with a willing spirit (and some help from the adequate documentation),
you'll find that P-Mail is a surprisingly satisfying piece
of software.

Pegasus Mail 2.10; freeware; http://www.cuslm.ca/pegasus/

Quarterdeck

You can get lost in the Quarterdeck Message Center (which ships
as part of Quarterdeck InternetSuite 1.0), but in a good way.
Quarterdeck Corp.'s QMC offers a wealth of configuration options
beyond the basic mail tools we expect to see in an up-to-date
package.

A tour of the Preferences dialog box shows why: Don't like how
QMC is displaying the messages in your inbox? You can choose
to sort by sender, date, size, or subject. Want to poll for
new mail every minute? You can change the default setting (10
minutes) to suit your needs. Want to be notified with a beep
when mail arrives? You can add a beep. Want to set the timeouts
on your mail-server communications to make sure you're not
waiting too long for a balky server? You can tweak the default
(normally 60 seconds) to fit your technology. Want to hang
onto your trashed messages for a week or so? You can specify
the number of days mail is allowed to sit in your trash folder
before it's purged.

If some of these settings seem nit-picky, remember that for
experienced e-mail users, those minor details can make a major
difference. About the only important detail missing from QMC
is a way to search through message text for a specific string
(which is almost mandatory for those who work with lots of
messages). There's even a utility for working with TAR (Tape
ARchive) files, a Unix archiving format common on the Internet.

Of course, you don't need to be detail-oriented to get the benefits
of QMC; if you're just looking for an inexpensive, easy-to
use mail package, QMC can give you what you need right out
of the box. Quarterdeck InternetSuite as a whole is quite the
bargain, encompassing QMC as well as the highly customized
Quarterdeck Mosaic and a Winsock that's easy to configure.
If you want a quick entre into Internet e-mail, InternetSuite
should be near the top of your shopping list.

SPRY Mail

ou probably don't automatically think of e-mail when you think
of Internet In A Box, but SPRY Mail, its mail module, is an
easy-to-use and surprisingly full-bodied personal e-mail program
that stands quite nicely on its own. It lacks some features
business users are likely to want-routing, searching, and sorting
but if you receive a moderate volume of mail, you may find
I-Box 2.0's $80 price worth it for the mail alone.

SPRY Mail certainly won't dazzle you with a wealth of advanced
features, but it's a true load-and-go package. All the important
functions are right at your fingertips immediately on installation;
just supply the name of your mail server and SPRY Mail does
the rest. If you don't have a Winsock or TCP/IP stack installed,
you can use the dialer provided with I-Box. Once you receive
mail, you can use the handy toolbar icons to forward, print,
or reply to it. Mail storage is in standard folders.

SPRY Mail supports multiple address books, which is convenient
if you're handling a slew of addresses and want to organize
them thematically. The address book files can be copied from
machine to machine, and you can send mail to all members of
an address book at once.

Those who want to get more out of the package can delve further
into mail configurations, deciding which signature file to
use and how often to check for incoming mail. You also can
change the location of your mail inbox, which can be convenient
when using I-Box over a network.

The absence of certain features, however, makes SPRY Mail a
questionable choice for business-oriented use. For example,
there's no mechanism for searching through your messages. There's
one weakness from the personal user's point of view as well
 You have to work online. People with networked connections
probably don't care whether they're connected while they compose,
read, and reply to mail, but private users who are paying a
service provider would rather do these things offline.

Still, for right-out-of-the-box performance, SPRY Mail has few
equals. And when you want to expand your e-mail horizons, SPRY
Mail will help.

The Bottom Line

By:
Kevin Reichard

Internet e-mail is a strong, mature software field. Realistically,
any of the reviewed packages here should serve most of your
needs; we picked them that way. But these are our choices:

Cross-platform: Eudora Pro for the Mac and PC. If yours is a
mixed shop, large or small, you really can't go wrong with
Eudora Pro: Its interface is the best of the packages reviewed,
but it doesn't sacrifice any power.

Macintosh: Claris E-Mailer. While there are a few things we'd
like to see added to Claris E-Mailer-most notably a way to
search through the contents of your inbox-it's nonetheless
a solid choice for Macintosh users.

Windows: E-Mail Connection. This is the strongest package we
reviewed, both in terms of ease of use and flexibility. It's
now a truly universal inbox, encompassing both e-mail and fax
communications.

The Online Service Connection

By:
Kevin Reichard

Wide-area e-mail has been available for many years to subscribers
of dial-up online services-most notably CompuServe. Despite
the easy availability of affordable Internet connections today,
online services still handle a lot of e-mail-including Internet
e-mail. How good a job do these services do with Internet e
mail? What are the trade-offs?

You can send e-mail across the Internet from any of these online
services, and receive it, too. Furthermore, these services
have recently cleaned up their addressing schemes (a significant
bugaboo in the past), allowing you to use a "real" name for
your Internet address (like Kreichard@prodigy.com) as opposed
to vendor-assigned service IDs (like 73670,

3422 on CompuServe). On the other hand, of this group, only
America Online can match the varied features found in full
fledged Internet mail service provided by the packages reviewed
here. Here are capsule summaries of the capabilities of the
Big Five:

 America Online is the most evolved when it comes to Internet
e-mail, by virtue of its support for MIME attachments-though
it can handle only one attachment per message. In addition,
AOL effectively integrates Internet addresses into its address
book, treating them just like standard AOL addresses. Thus,
you can create mailing lists in AOL that let you send hundreds
of messages to the Internet.

 CompuServe supports only straight text in Internet e-mail messages.
It doesn't support file attachments at all, but you can send
individual binary files across CompuServe's Internet gateway
as separate messages. CompuServe subscribers use a number of
different front ends (WinCIM, MacCIM, and Golden ComPass),
so there's no standard handling of address-book matters.

 MCI Mail supports MIME-formatted text attachments to messages,
but chokes on other MIME formats, such as image or audio files.
However, MCI Mail automatically uuencodes and uudecodes file
attachments sent via the Internet. Depending on the front end
you're using (like CompuServe, the service is text-based at
its core), you can create mailing lists that incorporate Internet
addresses along with other addresses.

 Microsoft Network uses the Exchange client provided in Windows
95 to send and receive Internet mail, but doesn't fully take
advantage of it: Exchange supports MIME attachments when used
with an Internet mail server, but the Microsoft Network itself
doesn't support MIME. However, it's very convenient to have
all your e-mail centered in one client, which is the biggest
advantage of MSN and Exchange.

 Prodigy features the best message-creation tools among the
online services-its address book doesn't differentiate between
Internet and Prodigy users, and there's even a spelling checker.
However, Prodigy doesn't yet support MIME attachments, which
means you're limited to text-only messages.

Internet Free-Mail

By:
Kevin Reichard

All e-mail packages reviewed in this feature require you to
have a direct connection to the Internet, and millions of you
are paying service providers for such connections, anywhere
from $5 to $50 a month. But this is America and entrepreneurs
are vying for your business (so to speak) by offering you Internet
mail service completely free of charge.

The catch? Advertising.

At press time, two companies-FreeMark Communications, in Cambridge,
Mass. (http://www .freemark.com/), and Juno Online Services,
in New York City (http://www.juno.com/)-are busy launching
free Internet e-mail services. By the time you read this, both
expect their services to be up and running. We checked out
the interactive demos at each vendor's Web site and looked
at the beta versions of their client software.

On the face of it, these companies really do appear to be offering
free e-mail: There are no limitations on the number of messages
you can send or receive; there are no long-distance phone charges
for accessing your mail; and there are no online charges. Indeed,
even the access software is free.

In both cases, however, your every e-mail-related move will
be accompanied by some form of advertising. With FreeMark,
each message you send will be "sponsored" by an advertiser,
and the advertiser's logo will be present as you retrieve,
read, and write messages. At the bottom of both outgoing and
incoming messages, you'll find links to offers from advertisers,
online coupons, or some other promotional messages.

Advertising will be the prime source of Juno's revenue as well,
though the company promises to supplement this with some online
marketing research, too

Your Money's Worth

Technically speaking, neither system is true Internet mail.
You're not directly accessing the Internet; instead, you dial
into the FreeMark or Juno computer to upload or download mail
not unlike the MCI Mail system.

Further, you're limited by the capabilities of the proprietary
software supplied by the service providers. FreeMark isn't
planning to support file attachments, and if the online demos
are an accurate indication, neither company will support quoted
replies or signatures. The only concession to standard Internet
mail conventions will be an address book.

Finally, both services are limiting their offerings to the Windows
world, though Juno says it may develop a Mac version if there's
enough interest.

Pre-Fab Home Pages--The major online services want to give you
a space on the Web-no programming required

By:
Joel T. Patz

Early in the Internet game, getting a Web page up and running
was technically complex. You had to delve into HTML code just
to create a sentence someone could read online. Learning the
protocols for Web page layout was confusing. And how on earth
were you going to be sure that links would really take surfers
where they were supposed to go? Without a lot of dedicated
equipment-and "extra" time that few of us have-personal Web
pages were little more than a fantasy.

Well, times change and fantasies become realities. The three
major online services-America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy
have paved the way, not just to creating Web pages, but to
putting them on the Web without setting up your own server
or signing on with an Internet service provider. HTML knowledge
has been replaced by filling in the blanks, some basic word
processing skills, and simple point-and-click operations.

Prodigy

scratchpad 1.0, the tool Prodigy provides for building personal
Web pages, is available to any service member using the onliner's
browser and following the directions on its Web home page.

Getting started couldn't be easier. Simply enter your name,
a user ID (which becomes part of your personal URL), a password,
your location, and your Prodigy ID-and you're off and running
with your first Web page. You begin by giving it a title and,
as suggested in a text box that automatically appears on your
screen, supplying details you want people to know.

Suppose, for example, you're a cook and want to develop an online
recipe file. Here's your chance to share your favorite dishes
and discuss results and refinements with others. Include a
couple of your favorite food-related URLs to add interest for
your readers and click Submit. You've done it.

You can create up to seven separate Web pages on Prodigy and,
if you want, develop an index that links the items in them.
There's a template that lets you effortlessly share your 10
favorite Web sites, and another where you can profile the best
clubs, restaurants, bars, outdoor activities, museums, etc.,
in your town. Still another template lets you share details
about your business. If you're curious about how many visits
your site gets, you can add a counter to any page. (The help
file will tell you how.) It's updated automatically.

Prodigy provides an Image Library-containing animals, flags,
and signs of the zodiac, to name a few-so your page can include
graphics from the get go. A variety of symbols is available
to call attention to hypertext links, such as a MailTo symbol
for e-mail; sound and movie symbols to identify links to audio
and MPEG video clips at other sites; and even symbols to indicate
the size of an image or file to be downloaded.

And while the current version of Scratchpad doesn't let you
include video or sound clips in your pages, you can include
JPEG, GIF and virtually any type of bitmap image files.

With Scratchpad, you don't have to worry about the mysteries
of special syntax and layout provisions. The templates do away
with all major design chores. To establish a link to another
document, just fill in the URL field. Headlines, section headings,
and body text are formatted automatically. If you include your
e-mail address, Scratchpad will tag it so visitors can send
you mail simply by clicking.

That Special Touch

Copying your documents to a floppy disk (which can be done using
the Prodigy browser's Save button) lets you see the HTML tags
added to your document. You'll find this interesting and instructive.
Those who know some HTML and want to refine documents by adding
their own special touches can use the Freeform template to
paste in any material created with an HTML editor.

Some size restrictions apply to Prodigy-based personal pages
 Text boxes (individual blocks of text) are limited to about
4,600 bytes each, and a page can't contain more than 20 KB.
Each Prodigy member is allocated 1 MB of free server space
and can get up to 10 MB for an as-yet undetermined nominal
charge.

You must be logged on to the Prodigy service to build your Web
page, and the regular charges against your monthly membership
apply. If you exceed your allowable hours, the extra time is
billed to your account. In contrast, CompuServe and AOL let
you work offline to save money.

COMPUSERVE

the beta version of CompuServe's Home Page Wizard, which we
tested shortly before its release, does a first-rate job of
helping you create sophisticated-looking Web pages.

A series of dialog boxes gets you started. Give your page a
title, then fill in personal information, such as name, city
of residence, occupation, and hobbies. This data, which can
be displayed, if you choose, at the top of your home page,
is to give visitors to your site some idea of who you are.
With these prelims out of the way, you can choose to work with
either a blank page or a template-a prefabricated page that
you'll modify as you develop your own. If this is your first
Web page, templates provide a welcome assist.

Pull-down menus plus a selection of icon buttons across the
top of the screen constitute the major page-development tools.
The buttons automatically apply HTML formatting to elements
of your document. You can either click on a button to activate
its function or drag and drop it to the place on the page where
you want to work. Either way, a dialog box opens to accept
your input.

Want to create a headline? Drag the Headline icon to the top
of the page; in the Edit Headline dialog box, type your text
and click on the Styles tab to choose the desired type size
and alignment (left or center). Do the same to add body text
(except that you don't have a choice of type size). With text,
you can opt to have items centered or bulleted. Adding images
is easy, too. Choose a file from the limited selection provided
in Home Page Wizard, or import your own GIF or JPEG image.
Home Page Wizard lets you adjust image height and width by
pixels.

To forge links to other parts of your Web document, first enter
the link text, which is what visitors will click on to make
the jump; then click on the internal location, such as page
two of a multipage document. Setting up a link to another Web
site involves no more than supplying link text, typing in the
URL of the other site, and clicking OK.

If you want to get reactions and comments from your readers,
you can set up an e-mail link that provides them with a pre
addressed message form that will automatically go to your e
mailbox.

To view your page, click the Test button, which launches your
Web browser. When everything is just as you want it, click
the Publish button or select Publish Pages from the File menu.
The Publishing Wizard takes care of the rest.

The Home Page Wizard is available for free download, and CompuServe
members can place their Web pages online at no cost during
an introductory period. Remember: You'll have to pay the usual
connect time charges during the publishing, or posting, process.

AMERICA ONLINE

Compared to the fill-in-the-blanks simplicity of Prodigy's Scratchpad
offering, and the drag-and-drop richness of CompuServe's Home
Page Wizard builder, America Online's initial foray into personal
Web page building technology is problematic. The tool itself,
GNNpress, is a product of NaviSoft (a recently acquired AOL
subsidiary); we looked at a beta version. Although you can
download GNNpress from AOL, you'll need an account on GNN (Global
Network Navigator, AOL's Internet service subsidiary) to publish
your page; your AOL membership is of no use here.

Editor or Creator?

The program is billed as a combination authoring tool and Web
browser, but we found it to be more a first-generation HTML
editor than an easy-to-use Web page creator. The current version
is not intuitive for first-time users, and even fairly seasoned
Web page authors probably would prefer not to hassle with the
complexities imposed by GNNpress. For example, during our testing,
we were frequently unable to reach the GNNpress server using
its browser.

Creating a Web page with GNNpress is a lot like using a word
processor. As you work, you choose the appearance factors of
your document-heading sizes, bulleted lists, and paragraph
formatting, for example. And if you're editing a document,
just highlight text and delete it, or highlight it and begintyping
your new text.

Pull-down menus control most formatting. If you want to render
a title in bold characters, highlight it, choose Format, and
select Bold. Menu choices let you remove formatting, unlink
items, and create numbered, un-numbered, or "definition" lists
(like glossaries)

Spicing It Up

You also can draw borders around elements and include preformatted
text on your page. Dress up your page with horizontal rules
that span the entire page, but there's no way to specify their
placement or define their thickness.

GNNpress lets you create multiple pages and establish links
between them, but creating links to external Web sites, while
possible, isn't simple. To do this, you have to use the built
in browser to navigate to the desired page, click the CopyURL
button, create the link on your Web page, and paste in the
copied name. While it ensures accurate http addresses, it's
a lot of work-especially if you knew the address already.

You can build an e-mail form by copying text from a sample page
included with GNNpress, but again, there's no simple way to
create one on your own. If you wade through the HTML code,
you'll find that the mailto: command is used to do this, but
we couldn't find it explained in the documentation.

On the other hand, a number of GNNpress features are perfectly
easy to implement. For example, you can highlight a plain text
list and instantly convert it into a bulleted or numbered list.
Further, multiple text lines can be block indented (click BlockQuote
format), block indented with italics (Address format), or single
spaced (Preformatted format). Simple commands turn text into
bold, italic, underlined, or fixed pitch. And you can easily
import JPEG and GIF files.

Link-Watch

GNNpress provides one especially cool feature-the Check Links
option, which launches the GNNpress browser and checks to make
sure that all jumps are functioning as they should. The program
also includes some clip art, but it falls mostly into the bullets
and arrows category.

GNNpress' documentation is adequate, but not exceptional. Since
the help system is an HTML document rather than a Windows help
file, searching for a topic is slower than in a typical Windows
app-despite the file's table of contents. And while AOL lets
you design offline, you must be online to use the help system,
thus incurring the standard AOL fee.

Tips for Fledgling Pagemasters

By:
Joel T. Patz

As you plan your personal Web page, keep in mind the following
conventions and requirements that affect Web authors at all
levels:

 Storage space. Text doesn't take up a lot of room, but graphics
and especially sound files can eat up the disk space the provider
allots per user. Be sure to first find out what your storage
allotment is. Next, check the size of any images and sound
clips you're considering including on your page. Then you can
fiddle with the balance of space requirements to come up with
your best possible page.

 Considerate content. A Web page is not the place to insult
and alienate people. (If you must indulge in rancor, Usenet
is a more appropriate venue.) Hence, it's a good idea to avoid
potentially objectionable material, such as obscene or sexually
explicit language, bigoted or racist assertions-not to mention
anything outright illegal. Copyright infringement is another
area to be wary of: If you're using someone else's material,
make sure you're free to do so and give them credit for it.

 Design integrity. You face built-in design constraints in creating
a Web page, mostly imposed by the limitations of HTML. For
example, you can't change the font style for different paragraphs
in the same document. But as HTML continues to develop-and
HTML 3.0 is a big improvement-different backgrounds, colors,
fonts, lines, and more complex audio and graphics elements
will be added to our design palettes.

 "Browser shift." Different browsers see Web pages differently,
depending on which HTML features they support. As a result,
not everyone who views your page will necessarily see it exactly
as you do, particularly where special effects are concerned.
Some browsers might have difficulty reproducing backgrounds
and colors; tables and forms might pose a problem for others.
Solution: Test your page with several browsers. Usually, you'll
get a clear indication that major parts of a page aren't viewable
when you call it up; you might see an icon, for example, where
a full graphic display is supposed to appear.

Bridging the Gender gap--Sometimes it seems there are about
as many women online as you'd find in a Foreign Legion camp.
An expert on the topic explores some causes of the online gender
gap.

By:
JUDITH BROADHURST

The numbers are perplexing. Though women represent approximately
51 percent of the U.S. population, a recent Nielsen study shows
a 2-to-1 male/female ratio of Internet users. Other recent
studies of both online services and Internet users report that
women represent between 30 and 37 percent of total users. Though
these numbers reflect a significant improvement over 1994 statistics,
which pegged the female online population at 15 to 20 percent,
they're hardly encouraging. n One knowledgeable observer questions
the validity of the statistics. "What does that mean?" asks
Ruth Kaplan, a research assistant at the Institute for the
Future, a think tank based in Menlo Park, Calif. "Do they mean
women who have been online once? And does that mean they're
going online to download a map of San Diego because they're
going there next week, or are they participating in a Usenet
newsgroup about a health problem they have?"

On the surface, this gender gap doesn't make sense. After all,
even if you buy into the stereotype of women as technophobes,
that doesn't explain the disparity that exists even on the
easiest-to-use commercial services, such as America Online,
eWorld, and Prodigy. And even though more women are online
and using these big-name services, they're still not taking
full advantage of what's there, or using resources resourcefully.

"I can't stand the Internet. I see it as a huge time-waster,"
says a disillusioned America Online subscriber, who actually
has never used the Internet. She requests anonymity, however,
because her job requires her to eventually master such tools.

Nurture Fights Nature

Part of the reason women find themselves disenchanted with the
online experience stems from cultural influences.

Men tend to see computers as technotoys, which means fun, but
women think of them as mere machines related to work. These
contrasting mindsets developed during childhood, says Dr. Mary
Frances Stuck, a sociologist and assistant dean of arts and
sciences at the State University of New York at Oswego. "Boys
tear things apart and use them in different ways than what
they were intended for," Stuck says, "but girls tend not to
explore. They're very task-oriented."

Children often are introduced to computers by shred-em and shoot
em computer games, which turn girls off. According to a recent
Find/SVP study, however, this pattern appears to be shifting
because women-now more involved in buying and using home computers
tend to choose educational rather than game software for their
children.

Nevertheless, the prevailing attitude is still that computers
are "a male thing." "These kinds of biases are deeply ingrained
in our society," says Chuck Huff, an associate professor of
psychology at St. Olaf College, in Northfield, Minn.

And in the workplace, women largely are reticent about viewing
the computer as more than office equipment. The sample of women
we interviewed repeatedly say that they feel guilty if they
use their computers at work for anything other than what is
obviously "work." They seldom see browsing online services
for information as "real" work. Instead, many of them think
of it as the equivalent of chatting with a friend by phone
on company time.

But all that's just background for the nine principal factors
that inhibit women's online involvement. Admittedly, most of
them involve misperceptions and stereotypes:

1. Lack of time

To many women, computers are hardly a necessity. At work, differences
in time-management styles play a large part in this misperception.
"Men delegate far more, thus free up time," Stuck says. "Men
delegate, women do." And at home, "It's because women are still
doing the dishes and putting the kids to bed and doing the
errands during the evening hours when most people are online,"
says Janet Attard, who leads business forums on both GEnie
and America Online.

2. Dollars don't make sense

Then there's the combination money-indulgence factor. "Computers
are perceived as a luxury technology, and women still don't
make as much as men, even in the same jobs," says Ellen Balka,
assistant professor of women's studies at the Memorial University
of Newfoundland.

"Women are less eager to spend money on hobbies," adds Judy
Heim, author of I Lost My Baby, My Pickup, and My Guitar on
the Information Highway and Internet for Cats. "We consider
it self-indulgent. We feel guilty, thinking we really should
be spending the money on our kids or other loved ones."

3. Negative media

One of the major reasons more women are not online yet-along
with lack of time and money-is media mythology. A search for
"women" and "online services" on any magazine or newspaper
database invariably turns up a list of predictable stories
about sexual harassment, pedophiles, stalkers, cybersex, online
romances gone wrong, and the risks of using credit cards for
online shopping. These make for juicy copy, but the sensationalized
stories that distort reality have scared many women away.

4. The graphics-are-good fallacy

Graphics, though simple to use, don't necessarily offer the
allure you'd think. "I'm anti-chat and anti-graphics because
I think those are the most inefficient uses of online services,"
says Teresa Mears, a journalist, editor, and newsletter publisher
in Miami. "I use online networks to get information and make
contacts with people, and it takes more time to do that in
live chat or if you have to wait for graphics."

"More user-friendly and more graphical are not necessarily the
same. We fooled ourselves into believing that," Memorial University's
Balka says. "Fancy graphics are for marketing. They help sell
products, but they don't enhance the quality of interaction
with my colleagues."

5. Combat is not hospitable

Especially in Usenet newsgroups, women find the atmosphere hostile,
intimidating, or childish. Words like "one-upsmanship" and
"mental masturbation" come up a lot when women talk about their
impressions of online discussions. Lisa Kimball of The Meta
Network sums it up: "Women don't think of conversation as a
contact sport."

6. Technology's not a turn-on

Some men seem to equate the power of their computers with real
power, and see bandwidth, RAM, megahertz, and hard-drive size
as something akin to sexual prowess. But women are unimpressed
with technology for its own sake. As Paula Span wrote in The
Washington Post magazine, "Women treat computers like reliable
station wagons: Learn how to make them take you where you want
to go, and as long as they're functioning properly, who cares
about pistons and horsepower? Whereas guys-even those who never
learned how to change an oil filter-are enamored by computers,
want to play with them, upgrade them, fix them when they falter,
and compare theirs with the other guy's."

7. The "geek chic" stereotype

"Before I was online," says Esther Gwinnell, a psychiatrist
in Portland, Ore., "I'd imagined it as mostly people who build
computers, with pocket protectors and many pens. Boy, was I
wrong!" The techies are there, of course, but this is simply
an outdated, off-base impression that persists among the uninitiated.

8. Fear of an alien nation

Women are more worried than men that we're headed toward a society
in which people communicate mostly electronically. Many also
assume that communicating by computer is cold, impersonal,
rather weird, and the preoccupation of social misfits. Partly
to counter this, the online industry co-opted the term "community"
to hype chat rooms. Not coincidentally, that's where these
services make the most money, aside from online gaming.

"It sounds good, because it's a feel-good, '90s mentality, but
'community' in that sense is used as a marketing ploy," says
Leslie Regan Shade, a doctoral candidate at McGill University
in Ottawa, who is doing her dissertation on gender and virtual
communities.

9. Misdirected marketing

Marketers haven't figured out quite how to cater to women online.
"Women don't want to be ghettoized; they don't want a separate
set of services. If you set aside a finance forum for women,
they feel like something's missing there and go to the regular
finance forum instead," says Jodi DeLeon, product manager for
the Microsoft Network.

As Regan Shade observes, "Women don't want recipes and fashion
online. We want ways to use the technology in productive, constructive
ways. We want breast cancer information and support groups,
and sites like Virtual Sisterhood [on the Web] and the kind
of things that are coming out of the Beijing conference [the
U.N.'s Fourth International Conference on Women]. [Content
developers] think all content for women should be consumer
oriented."

What's most important to know is that women want to be talked
to as individuals, not just as women, says Carol Wallace, a
spokeswoman at Prodigy. "[Women] don't go online to have a
'woman experience'; they go online like anybody else."

Ironically, not one commercial service has made an effort to
reach out to women at women's conferences, associations, or
conventions of women business owners. Yet Echo, a small New
York City BBS founded and run by Stacy Horn, rivals all of
the multimillion-member services in percentage of women members
and half of Echo's sysops are women. Horn says she goes out
of her way to actively recruit women. "We send each new female
member a letter asking if they'd like to be assigned another
woman on Echo as a mentor," she says. "The mentors teach them
not just the commands, but the culture."

A More Integrated Future?

As women have moved into corporate management, women have influenced
the shift to the popular model of management by consensus,
which involves everybody affected in decisions. Memorial University's
Balka says she hopes for a similar humanizing influence as
more women participate online; this influence, she believes,
will result in less flaming, posturing and preening, and more
true communication.

The Institute for the Future's Kaplan adds that more conscious
choices about the content, culture, and structure of the online
world and related public policies need to be made. She and
others want to see a diversity of voices plan the Internet,
with steps taken to ensure people of all ages, genders, and
economic levels get easy, affordable online access and feel
welcome.

No medium of communication and information since the telephone
and television is likely to have such a profound impact on
education, politics, and the way we live and work as this one.
That's why it's so important that women-who are traditionally
said to be more verbally adept and better communicators-help
guide its direction rather than dismiss it all as hype and
hoopla.

On a more practical note, being online is becoming a must for
professionals. "If you're not wired or in some way reachable
online, you're going to fall out of so many informational loops
that are available," Echo's Horn says. "You used to have to
go to luncheons and cocktail parties to network. Now you have
to be online."

To be sure, men haven't posted any "No Women Allowed" signs
online. It's the sensationalized media hype, outmoded and off
base stereotypes, and plain stubborness of women themselves
that are the likely culprits.

It's not merely a matter of career consequences, or even the
growing distance between the haves and have-nots. Ultimately,
it comes down to power-but of the medium, not the machine.
Two decades ago, Michael Korda wrote in Power: How to Get It,
How to Use It: "The person who controls the computer is thus
in a singular position of power." That person gains power over
not just information, but people, he said.

Korda's book was published just three years after the first
public demonstration of what we now call the Internet, and
four years before the oldest commercial service, CompuServe,
existed. It's now up to women to put aside their own skepticism,
wariness and "yes-but" attitudes and heed his words.@

For Grrls' Eyes Only

By:
Judith H. Bernstein

There's a lack of women online, you hear? You wouldn't know
it from this New York City group.

In a loft in Manhattan's Silicon Alley, women chat as they arrange
folding chairs into rows and put out refreshments. Aliza Sherman,
wearing her Cybergrrl T-shirt, is seemingly everywhere at once,
greeting guests as they arrive to take part in a New Media
phenomenon.

This is a meeting of Webgrrls, which may be the oldest established
permanent floating organization for women in new media: It
was founded by Sherman last April. Back then, Webgrrls' first
meeting drew six participants; this meeting has drawn close
to 100. Founding the group was the culmination of Sherman's
eight years online and part of her professional commitment
to the field. (She also started CG Media, an online communications
and marketing company, a year ago.)

The purpose of Webgrrls, Sherman tells the women at the meeting,
"is to share; not to be competitive with each other, but to
offer others opportunity." Thus, the meeting is an open forum
in which each participant introduces herself, then declares
what skills, information, or support she seeks from the organization,
as well as what resources she can give in return.

In that spirit, business cards and e-mail addresses are traded
as one participant after another speaks: The Webmaster from
Scholastic needs HTML designers. Julie Denny, an Associated
Press reporter and a director/mediator with the Alliance for
Mediation & Conflict Resolution, wants to learn how to use
the Web to dig up research on conflict resolution in the workplace.
Attorneys, financial consultants, students, artists, designers,
editors, writers, techies, and the admittedly Web-clueless
are in attendance, as well as those looking for a sense of
community. "I'm looking for support from other working moms,
and I can give back my knowledge on the background and history
of the net," one woman says.

Sherman's regular e-mailings to members, as well as FeMiNa,
her "Yahoo-type" search tool of links appealing to women, and
Cybergrrls, her own Web site (http://www.cybergrrls.com/),
round out Webgrrls' resources.

It's Webgrrls' open forum, created to curb inhibitions, that
compels the group to limit its membership to women, according
to Sherman. "This is for women, about women. Women have different
needs in a group professional setting [than men do]," she says.
"This gives them an opportunity to open up in a noncompetitive
atmosphere. Women are more likely to want to share with each
other."

Does this approach seem exclusionary? "Women say, 'You're ghettoizing
us; pigeonholing us.' But not one woman who has attended these
meetings has said that," Sherman contends. In fact, Sherman
cites inquiries from women across the United States and around
the world about starting Webgrrls chapters in their own communities.

Sherman also says she's working on a survey of women on the
Web. And, despite the commonly cited statistics on the dearth
of women online, she says, "Companies should target women now
and offer them things to attract them to come online. I'm doing
this now, regardless of the numbers [of women actually online]."

FAQ: All the News That's Fit to Speak -- Talk all day if you want
all it takes is knowing the IRC code

By:
David A. Harvey

Other than searching for ways to get out of paying taxes, the
second most human of qualities separating us from the animals
is conversation. We can't get enough of it.

Digital chatter is as old as the net, but its first implementations
were limited to Talk, a grotesque one-on-one protocol run from
the Unix command line. It wasn't until 1988 that the digital
Babel known as Internet Relay Chat, or IRC, began. Designed
by Jarkko Oikarinen (jto@tolsun.oulu.fi) as a replacement for
Talk on his BBS, the protocol and its clients spread to 60
countries and through a series of linked servers that now serve
hundreds of channels, thousands of topics, and tens of thousands
of responsive, real-time, live conversations.

For the technically curious, the workings behind IRC are defined
in the Network Working Group's Request For Comments (RFC) Number
1459 (ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/irc/support/rfc1459.txt)

What counts is that IRC allows one-to-one, one-to-many, and
many-to-many conversations. In IRC parlance, IRC itself refers
to the protocol; a server is a specific box (usually linked
to other servers) that implements the IRC protocol, along with
any server-specific rules; and a client is the software you
use to tap into IRC's scintillating discourse.

Channel Me In

The oldest and most trafficked IRC system is EFnet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu
efnet/), a cacophony of 11,000 users linked by 100 servers.

A band of netizens-sensitized to perceived privacy breeches
and lack of available bandwidth-staged an early revolt against
EFnet to form the UnderNet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu/undernet
), a smaller and more tight-knit community of IRCers. On average,
UnderNet includes 27 servers and a little less than 3,000 users.

Another IRC system, DALnet (http://irc.ucdavis.edu/dalnet/),
started as a role-playing-game alternative network. It's relatively
small and consequently cultish, averaging 130 users and 16
servers.

IRC networks are composed of channels, which are the equivalent
of chat rooms you can find on America Online, Prodigy, or CompuServe.
These networks carry thousands of channels dedicated to topics
ranging from cooking to high-energy particle physics.

Each channel is ruled by a channel operator-called a channelop
or op. Operators must maintain topicality, rid the channel
of abusive persons, and handle basic IRC functions. There's
no limit to the number of operators; most channels have several.

Time for Good Behavior

If you jump into the middle of an IRC channel and begin hurling
insults, you're likely to be booted from the channel, flamed,
or even banned from an entire server. Anonymous IRC conversations
aren't a ticket to repealing basic etiquette.

Neither does IRC etiquette stop at the obvious. Different channels
have different purposes and different rules, so listen before
you speak. Be especially mindful of structured channels (usually
business and academic) that may be set up to hold a news conference,
host a lecture, or field a structured Q&A session.

True privacy does not exist on IRC. Anybody can see what you
type, though the latest IRC clients make it possible to hold
fairly private, one-to-one discussions. Never type in passwords,
credit card numbers, or strange commands that a "helpful" stranger
suggests.

Before diving into IRC, it would be smart to read the IRC primer
(http://mistral.enst.fr/~pioch/IRC/IRCprimer/IRCprimer/IRCprimer.ht
ml) for a thorough discussion of IRC basics. If you want to
delve deeper, zip over to an excellent compendium of IRC resources
at both http://urth.acsu.buffalo.edu/irc/WWW/ircdocs.html and
http://www.escape.com/~ward/ircstuff.html. And, if chatting
is becoming a lifestyle, head to the alt.irc.whatever newsgroups
 You'll find topics that cover everything you need to know.

Executing Conversations

Like everything on the net, IRC requires a program that massages
your information to conform to the IRC protocol. The latest
and greatest is known as an ircII client; it supports everything
from chatting to exchanging files via DCC (Direct Client to
Client), playing sounds, and zapping a URL to a Web browser.

If you run Windows or Windows 95, browse over to Stroud's Consummate
WinSock App List (http://cwsapps.texas.net/phone.html) for
a roundup of IRC programs. Other platforms are stuck checking
the otherwise lame IRC FAQ (http://www.kei.com/irc.html)

Long-time IRCers disparage anything but plain, command-line
IRC programs. Ignore them. I mean, if you really would rather
type in /WHO #Twilight_Zone and watch a list scroll by at net
speed, fine. Personally, I'd rather point and click any day
of the week.

The best and easiest-to-use IRC clients run on graphical interfaces
and offer icon-driven support for the wealth of features supported
by ircII. These clients use scripting extensively; for uptight
servers, this can be a problem.

In the lingo of IRC, a script (or any other self-maintaining
program) is called a robot, or just a bot (http://www2.undernet.org
8080/~cs93jtl/unet_bot.txt). Bots are forbidden on some servers,
so, as a result, attempting to link to one of these servers
with an advanced ircII client may be impossible. If you get
an error message exclaiming, "Bots are not allowed" when you're
using a script-driven client, try another server location.

Windows users have been blessed with a cornucopia of superb
ircII clients. Best known is mIRC (http://sunsite.nijenrode.nl
ftp/pub/mirc/index.html), a multichannel-capable program that
supports file exchange, URL launching, audio, and operator
functions through pull-down menus and buttons. Netscape recently
released Netscape Chat (http://home.netscape.com/), which is
optimized to deal with URLs. It supports standard IRC and Netscape
IRC servers.

Unix heads are in good shape: You have a slew of command-line
ircII clients with full support for both interactive-only and
scripted IRC sessions. X-Window users are served by a small
but growing number of graphical clients.

If you're on a Mac (or another operating system, like VMS or
OS/2) it's slim pickings: the mostly command-line clients,
mostly unscripted support for IRC on these OSes pale beside
Windows and Unix.

Into the Future

I have seen the future of IRC, and it is virtual interactive
3-D. But don't take my word for it-check out Worlds Inc. (http
//www.worlds.net) and its latest Worlds Chat, now at Version
8. Worlds Chat calls on all the advanced features of ircII
clients (DCC, audio, and URL launching), and adds the ability
to navigate a fully 3-D world model using an avatar stand-in.

Another new effort, AlphaWorld, is found on CompuServe (you
can also get it from Stroud's list). AlphaWorld ups the 3-D
ante to include flying around and improved scenery. Tribal
Voice's PowWow (http://www.tribal.com/) stays 2-D but adds
in tours of the Web and voice.

What is clear is that, even more than the Web, IRC is evolving
into a true virtual community. With the ability to exchange
URLs, voice and data alongside real-time conferencing, IRC
is poised to become a prime focal point for the next generation
of Web usage.

Navigator: Getting Your Small Business Online--The world can be your small
business' marketplace

By:
Kate Gerwig

From a 300-square-foot shop in Pasadena, Calif., the owners
of Hot Hot Hot run a global business, shipping more than 100
kinds of hot sauce all over the world. In the process, they're
a model for small businesses that seek to burst the confines
of locality.

Further north, from a 10-foot by 10-foot basement room, Virtual
Vineyards opened its cyberdoors 14 months ago and began shipping
wine-supplied mostly by small California wineries-worldwide.

If you're thinking about placing your small business online,
or opening a virtual business, it pays to study the practices
of those that have gone before. Both Hot Hot Hot and Virtual
Vineyards have a lot more in common than the pursuit of gastronomic
excellence. Both are small businesses that successfully sell
products over the Internet. Their Web sites are friendly, informative,
and easy to navigate, and are persuasive enough to make the
most timid of taste buds try sauces like Nuclear Hell or encourage
those who confuse zinfandel with gew rztraminer to order specials
like "$99 of Wine on the Wall."

Because all Web sites are equally accessible, startup businesses
can exist alongside the Fortune 500 on a virtually level playing
field. But only a fraction of the more than 5 million small
 and medium-sized businesses in the United States are using
the Internet as an advertising, marketing, or sales tool.

Ticket to the World

If done properly, a small business' Web site can give a one
employee shop global presence with a few clicks of a mouse.
Hot Hot Hot proprietors Monica Bosserman Lopez and Perry Lopez,
who founded their walk-in business two years ago, say sharing
information with your clients is the essence of business success
on the Web.

"If you think you can put up a Web site and just get stuff [in],
it's not going to happen," Bosserman Lopez says. "You have
to understand what works because it's a very different style
of selling. Really successful Web sites give something back."

Both the hot sauce and wine online locations let you place orders.
Hot Hot Hot's site (http://www.hot.presence.com/g/p/H3/index.html)
generated 20 percent of the company's revenue last year. Virtual
Vineyards (http://www.virtualvin.com/), which exists only as
an online business, could be in the black in about a year,
according to company co-founder and self-described "cork dork"
Peter Granoff.

To develop a successful site, businesses first need to decide
what they want from an online location. Figure out whether
you want to enhance the company's image, generate sales leads,
or actually close sales. "You have to know who your target
market is, how you will contact users who express interest
in your product, and, if you're planning to close sales on
the net, how your customers will pay for online orders," says
Joel Maloff, an Internet consultant and author in Ann Arbor,
Mich.

Be realistic about the number of buyers vs. browsers at your
site. Bosserman Lopez says about 1 percent of the 30,000 surfers
who visit Hot Hot Hot each month actually place orders, "which
is as good as direct mail response rates."

A common lament from large and small businesses that load their
promotional materials on the Web is that nothing happens. "Just
putting up a site is like setting up shop in the middle of
a desert," Maloff says. Put your Internet address on your business
cards and stationery, he suggests. Then begin marketing your
site in ways that take advantage of the interactive medium.

At Virtual Advantage Inc. (http://www.virtualad.com/), a Web
design company in San Diego, founders Julie Bryant and Christine
Sheppard have created sites for several small businesses, which
use quizzes, competitions, cartoons, and e-mail to entice people
to revisit. "When you mess up a home page, it will be hard
to get people to come back again," Bryant says. Web pages need
to be quick, snappy, and compelling. Pages with too much text
turn visitors off.

Some Web designers have suggested that Virtual Vineyards redesign
its site using more complicated graphics. Virtual's Granoff
says he'd love to, but not until average modem speeds are faster
than 14.4 kbps. "Lots of stuff on the Internet is too rich
in graphics," he says. "If it takes you 30 minutes to access
a site, it's like inviting them into your store and then making
them wait half an hour."

Buy or Lease?

An effective Web site doesn't always come inexpensively, according
to Granoff, though he declined to say how much he's spent.
Virtual Vineyards has links on America Online and Prodigy,
a co-marketing agreement with CompuServe, and more online arrangements
in progress. The site is registered with search tools like
Yahoo and Lycos, and is thinking about doing some Web banner
advertising, Granoff says.

Still, cash-strapped businesses might be able to strike a deal.
Hot Hot Hot, for example, was able to work out a monthly payment
plan for being the first customer of Presence Information Design,
a Web design firm in Pasadena, Calif.

There are other creative ways for cash-poor small businesses
to get online. Gregory Wester, an analyst at the Boston-based
Yankee Group, suggests hooking up with an online restaurant
or shopping guide in your area. Boston's restaurant guide (http
//www.bWeb.com/) is a good example.

Some Internet access providers also have started offering special
pricing packages to small businesses. CERFnet offers small
businesses a 99-hours-for-$99 monthly package that includes
the tools for a basic, do-it-yourself Web site.

Global Village Communication Inc. (http://info.globalvillage.com
), a Sunnyvale, Calif., modem maker and Internet access provider,
has staked out the small and medium-sized business market with
turnkey net access packages that include an online template
for a plug-and-play Web site. "Most people don't have the internal
technology, so we provide a complete solution," says Steven
Eng, senior product marketing manager for Global Village's
Internet Services division. Performance Technology Inc. (http
//www.perftech.com/), in Austin, Texas, also sells a turnkey
system called Instant Internet, which provides a small-business'
network with secure Internet access via modem, ISDN, or a faster
connection.

Deciding where to store pages is another issue for small businesses.
Web pages designed by Virtual Advantage are stored for customers
on servers at CERFnet (http://www.cerfnet.com/), a California
and Arizona regional access provider. This means CERFnet's
network guarantees pages will be accessible to users seven
days a week, 24 hours a day. CERFnet spokesman Andy Markem
suggests small businesses stay out of the server purchasing
and maintenance business, comparing it to publishing a magazine
just to advertise your products and services.

Virtual Vineyards, however, owns its own server and does its
own engineering work in-house. It helps, of course, to know
that Virtual co-founder Robert Olson was an engineer at Silicon
Graphics Inc. before he shifted to the online wine arena.

Regardless of the hardware you use and the search engines you
list with, having a well-designed site may be the best advertising
you can have, according to Hot Hot Hot's Bosserman Lopez. "Other
sites will want to link to you-and your customers will come
back," she says. And that's a good step on the road to growing
a small businesses into a larger one.

Power Tools: Your Site's Got the Look--Your page can look sharp with the
right background, clip art, and icons

By:
Rich Santalesa

Take any visually rich site, strip the background out, pop the
icons off and dump the pictures out, and what remains? Basically,
the equivalent of a piece of typed paper. Plain text, plain
screen.

In any media, graphics make the difference between a merely
informative work and one packing the visual punch of a prime
Picasso. Luckily, the Web and every online service is stuffed
with useful graphic tools, libraries, and resources. If your
Web page or site is on the visually anemic side, a solid strategy
for tuning and tweaking is as simple as B, C, I.

No, BCI isn't a scandal-ridden bank. Rather it stands for Background,
Clip art, and Icons. Adding the right doses of all three can
completely make over your Web site.

Loading Up on Backgrounds

When building a house, you need a solid foundation. The same
holds for your Web site, where the page background acts as
a common foundation for your site. One of the smartest enhancements
to hit the Web, background images are an effective way to stamp
your site with a coherent corporate or personal seal.

If you haven't seen backgrounds, you're likely using an ancient
browser. When fed a small graphics file, the background tag
seamlessly tiles the graphic to create a wallpaper effect. With
the right graphic, logo or image, the results can be stunning.

Keep in mind that different platforms can and do map colors
differently. I've seen background images that looked perfectly
fine on a Mac yet were completely washed out, or displayed
unexpected colors, on a PC, and vice versa. Don't just assume
that if you see the image fine everyone else will also. Test
as much as you can with different browsers and systems.

Also, keep your background file small. A good role of thumb
is to never exceed 40 KB for any page image. If your graphic
file is larger, then consider using two separate versions-a
low-resolution image to speed loading and a high-resolution
file that can load in the background or when clicked.

For its part, Microsoft, in true Microsoft style, has added
a modification to the background command in its Internet Explorer
2.0 that lets you create what Microsoft dubs "watermarks."
A watermark is simply a background that stays put. With traditional
backgrounds, whenever you scroll the screen you scroll the
background.

By adding a bgproperties=fixed option to the background tag,
Explorer recognizes that the background image should stay put
when using a corporate logo or ad, for instance. It's easier
to visualize than to explain. For more details on Explorer
and its new tags, pop over to http://www.microsoft.com/windows
ie/ie20html.htm.

Though any GIF can be considered background material, the Web
holds many collections of background pages that should help
you in your quest for the perfect background and texture. Netscape
itself maintains a basic background collection at http://home.netscape.com
assist/net_sites/bg/backgrounds.html. None of Netscape's backgrounds
will win your site an award, but they're better than nothing.

For seriously cool backgrounds, you'll need to dig a bit deeper
into the online world's art archives, or consider creating
your own images. As always, a good place to start your quest
is at the doorstep of the net's various search engines, such
as Yahoo (http://www.yahoo.com), Lycos (http://www.lycos.com),
Excite (http://www.excite.com), InfoSeek (http://www.infoseek.com),
or Webcrawler (http://www.Webcrawler.com). Each has a variety
of graphic categories, and searching on the keywords backgrounds,
clip art and icons will turn up numerous pages offering backgrounds,
such as the Terry Gould graphics collection (http://www.netaccess.on.ca
~kestrel/list.html.)

Coloring Your Clip Art

Once you've fitted your page with a sizzling background, it's
time to perform some graphic fine-tuning. Using graphic elements
above and beyond backgrounds typically means turning to existing
images or clip art libraries and collections.

If you're comfortable using Photoshop or another graphics program,
it's an easy matter to whip up batches of your own images.
When you look at your page and start dancing because things
look so cool, it's a safe bet you've hit upon what you want.

An easy way to start feeling that happy foot-tingling is to
fly into the Web Weavers Warren page, which is one of the best
collections of links to graphics, backgrounds, icons and art
(http://fox.nstn.ca/~tmonk/weaver/iconimag.html). If you can't
find something of interest here, then it's time to hang up
your Web browser.

Another longtime collection of clip art is Sandra's Clipart
Server at http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/sjl/clipart.html. Most
of the images offered aren't going to set your heart fluttering,
but for graphics in a pinch Sandra's served up some filling
selections. Likewise, Grahame's Graphics for Home Pages at
http://www.computan.on.ca/~grahame/graphics.html contains hundreds
of useful buttons, icons and other graphics.

Don't overlook the obvious when searching for graphics. Checking
for art at the home pages of graphic software companies is
a smart and safe bet. For instance, MetaTools (formerly HSC)
at http://www.hsc.com, Corel at http://www.corel.com and others
display and demo a wide variety of art created with their programs.
Each also sells inexpensive, yet well-done, collections of
clip art on CD-ROM.

Icons Galore

While clip art adds context and meaning to your Web site, icons,
graphic lines and buttons provide the graphic glue to tie your
site together. As hard as it is to believe, there are people
on the Web who seem to do nothing but create free art for others
to use. Take advantage of their generosity.

For instance, a good starting point for gathering icons is,
again, the Web Weavers Warren page, or the Icon Browser page
(http://www.cli.di.unipi.it/iconbrowser/icons.html). Though
the Icon Browser page isn't well designed in terms of usage,
with a bit of effort you'll walk away with whatever you need.

Last, if you come across an icon that you simply can't live
without, send the page's owner an e-mail asking for permission
to use it. More often than not you'll be pleasantly surprised
to find the owner doesn't mind if you grab a copy for yourself,
but always ask.

Tools for All

In the end, the best sites all use some home-generated art.
If you don't already have a collection of graphic tools, converters,
and add-ons, try the following software and shareware libraries

Virtual Software Library (http://vsl.cnet.com)-a massive gathering
of 130,000 software files from the 22 largest shareware and
freeware archives on the Internet; The Father of Shareware
(http://www.halcyon.com/knopf/jim)-a site by one of the fathers
of the shareware scene that links to many other shareware collections;
and The Software Site (http://softsite.com/)-a killer collection
of software for all platforms. If you only visit one graphic
tool site, this isn't a bad choice.

Webmaster: Long-Range Web Planning -- Plan hard or watch your Web site
die. It's the new Webmaster code

By:
Jonathan Gross

Nothing moves faster than the computer industry. Yesterday's
hot system is today's ho-hum computer, and today's "standard"
is tomorrow's forgotten application programming interface.
The same rule holds true for emerging Web technologies.

During the next 12 months, Webmasters will face the difficult
task of deciding which of the up-and-coming Web technologies
should be on their sites. They'll also have to figure out how
to pay for them, and, even more vital, how to best manage it
all. Choose right and you'll ride the wave of the next year;
choose wrong and your site will be forever playing catch-up.
What do you need to keep in mind? Here are the top items to
factor into your Web planning.

HotJava

HotJava promises to bring sophisticated animation and more to
the Web via "applets," or programs written in the Java programming
language. Applets are included (like images) in HTML pages.

What does this mean to the person hosting a large Web site?
Not much, actually. Since the Java code is downloaded and run
on the client system, there is no additional overhead placed
on the host CPU. Java applets also are a bit smaller than many
images, and so the bandwidth requirements are minimal. Writing
applets, however, is a different story. If you intend to add
HotJava to your site, start scoping out the local C++ talent.

For more information, visit http://www.javasoft.com/faq2.html#g1,
or find a copy of John Decembers' book Presenting Java for
a general overview of Java.

Security

As the Internet has grown, commercial-grade security has become
vital. Whether you're talking about a firewall that protects
your entire internal network or a secure-transaction Web server,
security is never far from a Webmaster's thoughts.

As a matter of course, firewalls come in two flavors-packet
filtering and proxy-based. The correct type for your network
depends on the security decisions and policies you set. Although
the software needed to build a firewall on the Internet can
be obtained for free, configuration is a serious business-even
for the network savvy.

Turnkey firewalls that combine hardware and software as a unified
package start at around $10,000. That may seem expensive, but
it's a solid and often cost-effective alternative to piecing
together your own.

Netscape's server, as well as others, allows secure transactions
to be made between client and server, enabling credit card
orders and other sensitive information to be passed via the
HyperText Transfer Protocol. Right now there are many applications
that use credit cards as a possible method of payment. This
will be a field of development to watch closely.

Hardware and Technology

As always, outside developments in hardware and technology mean
steady planning back at the server. As faster modems replace
the existing base of V.32 and V.32bis modems, space hogs such
as video and audio files (MPEG, AVI, etc.) will begin flooding
server drives. Seriously audit your disk space usage, as well
as your line bandwidth capacity.

Control and Regulation

As the net grows, so will the need for regulation and control,
though it may not fall in the hands we'd like. For instance,
as aspects previously under government control move over to
for-profit organizations, such as the InterNIC, a $2 billion
U.S. government defense contractor in control of the root nameservers,
the Internet will change steadily. The recent imposition of
fees for domain names is one example of the type of charges
that might be imposed and gradually applied to other aspects
of the Internet. It behooves all system administrators and
Web presence providers to stay abreast of developments in the
arena.

Database Integration

If you're not running a database behind your Web pages, you're
missing one of the best Web tools around. Numerous database
solutions are available now, such as Next's WebObjects and
MiniSQL and its W3 query interface W3_mSQL, which is a single
Common Gateway Interface program that acts as a query generator.

In certain situations, storing all Web elements in a database
can be an effective way for the Webmaster to control revisions
and content, and ease the task of Web site administration.
Storing your Web contents in a database also can offer an extra
degree of security in various circumstances.

However, keep in mind that if the query engine and the database
run on the same system as your Web server, there could be a
significant draw on the CPU power of that machine. All right,
perhaps not a significant drain if you happen to be running
your Web server on an Onyx or DEC 300-MHz Alpha. But for those
of us making use of the Intel flavor of Windows NT, smaller
Sun workstations, Linux, or another desktop-sized machine,
this will be a consideration.

VRML

Virtual Reality Modeling Language is an ASCII-based language
that describes three-dimensional worlds. VRML isn't a weekend
project. Object inlining will be used in VRML even more than
in HTML documents, so the load placed on the server, especially
as multiconnection browsers are developed, will be high in
terms of bandwidth, CPU load, and, of course, disk space and
access. Large VRML worlds may have to be distributed across
several servers in order to achieve acceptable load limits.

If you are going to be implementing VRML on a large scale, you
would be wise to look into additional servers. More information
is available from the VRML Architecture Group (http://vrml.wired.com
VAG/) and the VRML Repository (http://www.sdsc.edu/SDSC/Partners
vrml/)

HTML

For almost two years, various organizations have been pushing
to create a single HTML standard. Various drafts of these proposals
have circulated: HTML+, HTML 2.0, and now HTML 3.0. But even
as these standards are argued and mulled over, non-standards,
such as Microsoft's and Netscape's extensions to HTML, are
becoming pervasive.

As America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, the Microsoft Network,
and other online services increasingly supply access to Internet
services, there will be a corresponding increase in hits by
their proprietary browsers. These browsers are mostly HTML
2.0 compliant, and are fairly picky about interpreting HTML
documents per the standards set out at the World Wide Web Consortium
(http://www.w3.org/)

To reach as many people as possible with your pages, test your
designs using as many browsers as possible. Though Netscape
is the browser king, your documents are certain to be viewed
by a number of browsers that do not cope well with Netscape
extensions. Plan accordingly.

As the end of this year looms on the horizon, make time to scope
out the year that lies ahead. Plan your network configurations
carefully, keep up with new innovations, build something worthwhile,
and most of all, have a good time doing it.

CyberGuide: COMPUTERWARE

By:

INFO CENTRAL

OK, we have a confession to make. We're information junkies.
That makes the All-in-One Search Page a very dangerous place
for us. William Cross' collection of forms-based Internet search
tools has so many links to huge databases and powerful search
engines that we start salivating just thinking about it. Sure,
the site comes in handy when we're researching CyberGuide,
but it's also maddeningly distracting. Forget about getting
any real work done. We're busy looking up an old friend via
MIT's finger gateway, tracing an elusive bit of Macintosh shareware,
plugging in the local weather station's code for a temperature
check, calling up Henry V's rousing St. Crispian's Day speech
from The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, and-well, you
get the idea. But with easy access to Yahoo, Lycos, and Veronica,
along with the less-familiar net reference sites, can you blame
us? (Our only complaint: Not every form is accompanied by a
how-to-search explanation.)

OK, a second confession. We tend to put off until tomorrow what
we can do today.Maybe this site is too good for journalists
with a proclivity toward procrastination.

CyberGuide: EARTH MATTERS

By:
Rebecca Rohan

 
CRY WOLF

When the moon is full, do you check over your shoulder whenever
you hear a strange noise? Maybe all those werewolf movies have
given the Canis lupus a bad rap. According to Wolf Haven International,
"not a single documented case exists of a wolf having killed
or even severely maimed anyone in the wild."

At its Web site, Wolf Haven, a 13-year-old nonprofit organization,
provides an education about wolves as well as how to protect
and preserve them. You can get to know more than 30 of these
predators-with names like Little John, Princess Lilypad, and
Hambone. (Their cuddly photos are more likely to elicit sighs
instead of screams.) There's a program that lets you "adopt"
a wolf, too. In doing so, you'll receive an adoption certificate,
a color photo and biography of your adoptee, and a silk Wolf
Haven bookmark. Membership packages for Wolf Haven are available,
which include a quarterly magazine and unlimited visiting privileges
at the Tenino, Wash., wolf sanctuary.

Visitors to the site also are invited to attend a summer Howl
In at the sanctuary, where they can enjoy musicians, storytelling,
and a campfire marshmallow roast. Sounds like something to
howl about.

CyberGuide: GOOD READS

By:

WRITE STUFF

Every journalist who picks up a pen or labors behind a keyboard
knows the significance of the Pulitzer Prize. Presented annually
by Columbia University-and named after Joseph Pulitzer, a renowned
publisher during the 19th century-this annual award has been
acknowledging achievements in American journalism since 1917.

Now you can read the articles that netted a select group of
journalists the coveted prize for 1995. Check out the series
by Brian Donovan and Stephanie Saul from Newsday, a Long Island,
N.Y., newspaper, that revealed disability pension abuses by
local police. It captured the Pulitzer for investigative reporting.
A distinguished example of beat reporting can be found in the
series on Washington politics and the national scene, filed
by David Shribman from The Boston Globe.

Overall, Columbia presented 14 Pulitzer prizes in the journalism
category. Unfortunately, the Letters and Drama category, consisting
of books, plays, and poetry, won't give you the pleasure of
reading winning entries. However, the sound samples from composer
Morton Gould's winning "Stringmusic," makes up for it. You'll
be sorry if you write this one off!

GOING PUBLIC

If PBS Doesn't Do It, Who Will?" The Public Broadcasting Service's
new motto is a sobering one. What will massive cuts in public
television funding mean to PBS' reliable, high-quality lineup
of child- ren's, cultural, educational, nature, news, public
affairs, science, and skills programming? More pledge breaks
at the home of Mystery!, Masterpiece Theatre, and Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood? Perish the thought!

On PBS Online, you'll learn about PBS' mission and future. Take
a gander at What's on PBS?, a handy table serving monthly listings
and program home pages. Bill Nye, the Science Guy's page is
fun for kids, but Mister Rogers' page seems to be talking to
Mom and Dad. Like some educational programming, many of these
Web pages are informative, if a bit stuffy. (The Rock and Roll
page is an exception, with its animated, burning guitar!)

We vote for more original online content to complement PBS'
shows. New York City's WNET page, for instance, hosted "trumpet
virtuoso" Wynton Marsalis for a live chat in conjunction with
Marsalis On Music. Click on a map for a look at your local
PBS station and-if you're lucky-schedules and home pages.

PARK AVENUE

When you venture outdoors into the cold, crisp winter air, you
want clothes that look cool but keep you warm.

Trek over to L.L. Bean's online catalog. It's loaded with easy
to-find products, vivid color photos, and consumer-friendly
information. Products are neatly divided into categories for
specific outdoor activities. And handy measurement directions
and charts will assure a good fit when you place your order
by fax or phone, 24 hours a day. Sorry, no online order forms
here.

Now that you're wearing your new Gore-Tex Day Hikers and lightweight
fleece jacket, with a pioneer pack over your shoulder and a
Pocket Survival Tool tucked in your jacket, are you all dressed
up with no place to go? L.L. Bean's detailed Park Search has
a multitude of suggestions for you: nearly 900 national parks
and forests, state parks, and other great outdoor spots across
the United States. Search by region, outdoor activity, and
season-you'll find the best places to make use of your new
apparel and accessories. Next stop, the Outdoor Sports section.
It provides helpful hints and a guide to the outdoors.

So, now that you're all set, why don't you go take a hike?

DR.'S ORDERS

Good health is something most of us take for granted-until it
suddenly disappears. Sometimes, our bodies falls victim to
illness without warning. Other times, we run ourselves ragged
either too much work or too much play.

Regardless, one easy (and germ-free) way to stay healthy is
to visit Health on America Online. Here you'll find over-the
counter information on a variety of subjects, including Diet,
Exercise and Fitness, Eyes and Vision, and Men's and Women's
Health. A double-click on Eyes and Vision, for example, will
bring into focus links to relevant articles, a message board,
a chat room, and a software library for further research. This
site also offers a heavy dose of attention to AIDS and HIV,
including a daily summary with the latest news.

Many of the topics discussed at Health deal with diseases that
are out of our hands, but which can be controlled to some extent.
You'll find folders on cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis,
and learning and physical disabilities, where you can read
about how to deal with these problems and the stress that accompanies
them.

You don't need an insurance plan for a check-up on this site.
And while you're at it, pop a vitamin C for safe measure.

COMMUNITY

Think globally; act locally. Have you heard the phrase so often
it's lost its meaning? Well, the Contact Center Network is
trying to bring the idea back home-to your neighborhood. The
group's home page explains its mission: to create community
based "contact centers," supported by regional and national
ones, where you can drop in, get to know your neighbors, and
find out how to contribute to causes-far away or close to home
that interest you. For a typical scenario at a center, link
to a Day in the Life.

Like the centers, the group's home page also serves as an information
clearinghouse on volunteerism, linking you to more than 2,500
directories, publications, and nonprofit organizations. You
won't find fancy graphics, just comprehensive resources simply
and sensibly arranged.

Look into international organizations such as UNICEF and Doctors
Without Borders, or browse by country. U.S. resources are arranged
by state. Have an issue in mind? Greenpeace and the Rainforest
Action Network are under Environment, and Habitat for Humanity
is under Homelessness and Housing. The Contact Center Network
plans to add a search engine to the directory. If you have
any resources, go ahead and pitch in.

In African weddings, for example, the best man is known as
the "warrior." Carrying a shield, his job is to protect the
bonding of the bride's and groom's families. There's also a
listing of symbols and what they represent in a marriage, including
wine, wheat, and pepper. The guide offers links to help you
pick out quality fabrics for your outfit, and tips on how to
economize on wedding expenses. You'll even find the Lord's
Prayer in Swahili. We were impressed that a few potentially
sticky, '90's-style situations were addressed: incorporating
African tradition into an interracial marriage and how to involve
children from previous marriages.

One of the sweetest symbols we found here bears a simple message
that can apply to all marriages, regardless of culture: "Love
does not get lost on its way home."

CyberGuide: SOUND BOOTH

By:
Kathleen Sands

 
NOTABLE

Music appreciation class flashback: Scratchy records of awful
arias forced on you by a tuneless teacher who looked just like
that bust of a dead composer sitting on your class' piano.
But now you're all grown up-and you have a sneaking suspicion
there's more to life than Pearl Jam. If you're too awed by
the classical music mystique to know where to start or to ask
for help, open your ears to Classical Net, where Web maestro
Dave Lampson guides you through the "basic repertoire of works
that have, over time, become central to the Western tradition
of music, and recommended recordings/performances of these
works." You don't need a snobbish attitude or scholarly approach.
"All that is required is a desire to explore and discover new
musical territory," he says.

Explore the ethereal airs of medieval mystic Hildegarde von
Bingen, baroque master J.S. Bach's demonstration of the "Art
of the Fugue," the unabashed romanticism of Claude Debussy,
or Philip Glass' breathtakingly modern "Einstein on the Beach."
(No, Counting Crows didn't write it!) No audio archives, but
histories, composer data, searchable indexes, and links to
a symphony of net resources make Classical Net a well-orchestrated
delight.

HOOP DREAMS

Leave it to the National Basketball Association to produce a
dazzling Web page, replete with the perfect blend of game results,
team news, player profiles, transactions, and schedules. Sure,
NBA.com, the league's official home page, is a clever promotional
tool. But it also will score big points with its fans.

Complete with a library of real-time videos and sound files,
NBA.com is as breathtaking as Orlando Magic's super point guard
Anfernee Hardaway. And speaking of "Penny," check out the Player
Directory for Hardaway's vitals and career statistics (along
with the other pros')

Are you a transplanted basketball fan unable to follow your
favorite team because you live on enemy turf? NBA.com covers
all 29 teams in detail. And with feature columns on international
basketball, NBA.com reaches a worldwide audience. Other features
worth a mention are the illustrated referee guide and the NBA
merchandise store.

It would be nice, however, to see a tribute to the legends of
the game who paved the way for today's stars and the success
of the NBA. How about a "Legend's Guide" or record book? Oh
well, you know what they say in the NBA: Nobody's perfect-except
for Michael Jordan.

CyberGuide: TRAVELOGUE


Adam Martini

 
VIRTUAL ESCAPE

Look at the horizon. You see only to the point where the earth
touches the sky, but you know beyond that there's a vast world.

To experience the many wonderful and exotic locations across
the map, tune into the Travel Channel. The online network's
Spotlight shines on a new location each month, offering in
depth information on culture and tourist attractions. But before
you pack your bags, take a trip to the Travel Facts & Opinions
category for tips, destination suggestions, and hot travel
news. (For example, the eight-page Italian Traveler reviews
hotels, restaurants, and shopping locations.) It's all delivered
in newsletter format.

When you're ready for that much-needed vacation, visit Vacation,
Holidays & Getaways and find out how to obtain special travel
deals. But if you're unable to escape, then take a vicarious
vacation-browse the Photo Gallery to see colorful photos from
around the world or link to Travel Talk to hear how other people's
vacations went.

The Travel Channel is a well-organized, resourceful site for
serious and wannabe travelers. It serves as your window to
the world, where your vision reaches as far as your Web browser
can take you.

Net.Dialog: Cerfing the Net -- Interconnection is the key to cooperation,
says one of the fathers of the Internet.

By:
Bob Berger

Aside from the O.J. trial, nothing inflamed the public imagination
last year like the Internet.

It popped up in every form of media, in every discussion of
business and leisure, at every cocktail party. Suddenly you
were out of touch if you weren't plugged in.

Vinton Cerf was there at the beginning. A principal programmer
for the ARPAnet project in the 1960s (a precursor to the Internet)
and a co-developer of the now-ubiquitous networking protocol
TCP/IP, he more recently served as president of the Internet
Society and was named one of People magazine's "25 Most Intriguing
Persons" in 1994. The 52-year-old Cerf was already plugged
in when some of us were in diapers.

Currently MCI's senior vice president of data architecture,
Cerf is a thin, mercurial man who seems energetic enough to
power his own laptop. He sat down at a small conference table
and talked to us practically non-stop about what has been for
him a crusade as well as a career.

Q: Is the phrase "surfing the net" derived from your last name?

A: There was a company in San Diego called General Atomics that
got into the networking business and decided to call itself
surf.net. It turns out another company in the Netherlands had
a similarly named service. So these guys called themselves
the California Educational Research Foundation Network.

Q:That spells cerf.net.

A: Exactly. Then somebody thought, "Hey, what if Vint minds?"
So I got a call and I confess that I hesitated a minute before
happily signing off on it. Soon after that, out in San Diego,
they were hawking T-shirts with "cerfing the net."

Q:Were you there for the net's birth?

A:There are different views of when things are born. Last year
there was a big celebration of the 25th anniversary of the
Internet, though ARPAnet and the Internet were kind of blurred
in that.

Q:Wasn't ARPAnet the beginning?

A:Partly. In 1969, as part of the Department of Defense, ARPA
[Advanced Research Projects Agency] was exploring packet switching
in the hope of keeping its computer networks up in case of
nuclear war. Around 1972, packet radio and packet satellite
programs also got started at ARPA, and it was only in the context
of these and other networks that the whole question of interconnection,
or "internetting," came up.

Bob Kahn, who had been one of the chief architects of ARPAnet,
recognized the need for this interconnection and came out to
Stanford, where I was teaching. He posed this problem: How
could all these things be interconnected without allowing any
of the networks to be changed or any of the host computers
to know what was going on inside the networks while being connected?

Well, we came up with TCP/IP. So I think the birth of the Internet
was 1973. Others think it started with Paul Baran's original
packet switching papers in 1962. I suspect the public thinks
it started in 1994, when it was suddenly thrust upon their
unsuspecting consciousness.

Q: You've been at this since the stone age of computers. Why
did you initially get involved?

A: I'm a programmer in my bones! I get a rush making a complex
artificial world do what I actually program it to do. Now,
imagine trying to get a diverse set of computers and networks
all over the country to internet seamlessly so that a program
running on one machine could effectively interface with a program
running on another, and without having to know what was going
on inside of either and to be robust and to work when parts
of the network were being blown up or an enemy was using jamming
devices.

Remember, this was originally intended for military applications.
Not only did I have to make it work, but work during and after
a nuclear war. Well, show me a more complicated challenge than
that!

Q:The Electronic Frontier Foundation gave you the Pioneer Award
in 1993. It seems to be the guardian of a certain morality
on the Internet. I wonder if you embrace its precepts.

A: First, let me substitute the word "ethic" for "morality."
I feel more comfortable with that.

Second, you have to realize that the origins of this whole thing
evolved in the academic community. ARPA provided the money,
but it was the academic community that did the research, which
was at first a very big problem. Every year, all these scientists
would ask for their own computers, plus they would jealously
guard their research. The situation became so competitive without
sharing that it was almost anti-productive.

Well, ARPA wanted to get more research for its buck, so it insisted
that ARPAnet be used as a tool in the research-in other words,
a way to get on the other guy's computer and run his software
on it without ferreting out his choicest secrets.

A marvelous side effect occurred. With this technological safeguard,
people started to loosen up. They started to cooperate. Frankly,
that's how you make progress in science: You share your results
so other people can validate them. In fact, that's how you
make progress anywhere. Well, this ethic of cooperating and
sharing, for the most part, continues on the Internet today.

Q: You wrote an article for the Internet Society called "Life
in a New World." How different will life in the future of cyberspace
be?

A: Very different. The net is a new infrastructure, blending
mass media and personal interaction. So we will have to learn
how to adapt our behavior and our laws to cope with that, especially
given the Internet's global qualities. Someday in the next
decade, the Internet may be comparable in size to today's telephone
network. At that scale I'll bet there'll be many, many, more
surprises-surprises we won't be able to imagine.

One day we may be wearing computers-and think of the wonderful
word play that will create: softwear, hardwear, and so forth.
And as these devices become more common, it will be quite sensible
to network them. So in the middle of the next decade, we may
have networks to download a new program for our microwave to
make it smarter about how it softens the ice cream. Things
like that.

Life will become a software rather than hardware thing-and our
human flexibility and facility and evolvability will be forced
to change dramatically to accommodate being so "plugged in."
