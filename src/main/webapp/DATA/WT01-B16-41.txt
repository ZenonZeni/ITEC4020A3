<html><pre><h4>								APPENDIX B - 
				REGIONAL WASTE ACCEPTANCE SCHEDULE</h4></pre>

<p>

[The Regional Waste Acceptance Schedule (RWAS) will provide a
listing of the annual allocations within each servicing region.  The
RWAS will list the quantities (MTU's and number of assemblies) and
locations (nuclear power plant site or commercial storage facility) of the
SNF which define the RSA's minimum level of service.  The RWAS
will reflect the Purchaser's needs for waste acceptance services.  At this
time, it is anticipated that the RWAS will define these servicing
requirements at the annual level.]
