Previous research in the use of hydrogen in internal combusiton engines 
did not address the reduction of internal engine friction. This project 
is aimed at reducing the internal engine friction to achieve high brake 
thermal efficiencies from the high indicated thermal efficiencies 
produced by hydrogen-fueled engines.
<p>
Research to date has resulted in the design and testing of a dedicated 
hydrogen-fueled engine that operates without flashback and without timed 
injection over the full range of fuel-air ratios. The maimum indicated 
mean effective pressure during operation was 911 kPa (132 psi). The 
maximum indicated thermal efficiency was 42.0%. The engine design 
required the construction of a billet aluminum cylinder head and modified 
piston.
