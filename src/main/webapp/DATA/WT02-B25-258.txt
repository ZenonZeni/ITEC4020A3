<H2>NAMI Resolution</H2>

<HR>
The following resolution was passed by the NAMI board of directors on 
February 5, 1996:
<p>
	The NAMI board of directors believes that the mission of the National
 Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) should be, first and foremost, the support
 of research on severe brain disorders such as schizophrenia and affective
 disorders in adults and children. We are deeply concerned that the breadth 
of the NIMH research activities has detracted from this mission.  Therefore,
 we resolve to take the requisite steps to ensure that NIMH will 
significantly increase its leadership and the proportion of its funding for
 research on the above illnesses in fiscal year 1997, including testimony 
before the U.S. Congress concerning NIMH's inadequate focus on research on 
the above illnesses.  We will further direct advocacy for the most 
appropriate federal policies and administrative structures to increase 
research on the above illnesses, including the following: 1) renaming the 
NIMH; 2) changing the NIMH mission statement to reflect a strengthened focus
 on the above illnesses; 3) changing the NIMH advisory council so that the 
majority of the council's members are experts or advocates for the above 
illnesses and so that the council includes family members and individuals 
with these illnesses; 4) adding the requirement that 85 percent of the NIMH 
budget be devoted to the above illnesses; and 5) supporting congressional 
suggestions that all NIMH research grant applicants be required to indicate 
how their proposed research is relevant to the above illnesses.
