SEVERAL FUELS ISSUES REMAIN TIED-UP IN BUDGET DEBATE

      A number of issues important to the refining and marketing
industry remain unresolved as Congress and the White House negotiated
over the budget and the federal government remained closed last week. 
The U.S. EPA remains unfunded, operating with a minimal staff, and
officials at the Agency warned that they're unable to enforce
environmental statutes.
      The Clinton Administration and Congressional Republicans appear
to be far apart on a number of issues, including the taxable status of
kerosene for home heating and the depreciation schedule for
convenience stores operating in conjunction with gasoline stations.
      Due to lack of appropriations for EPA, funds have also run out
for the Federal Leaking Underground Storage Trust Fund (LUST) and the
Superfund Trust Fund.  Below is a review of programs and tax issues
affected by the Washington, D.C., stalemate, including federal motor
fuels taxes as of Jan. 1 that may still be changed under final federal
budget programs.

Clinton Seeks Tax On Kerosene For Home Use

      One provision of a White House budget proposal would impose a
tax on kerosene mixed with heating oil.  Under the current law,
kerosene is subject to the 24.4 c/gal diesel fuel tax when it is mixed
with dyed, on-road diesel fuel.  It is not subject to the tax when it
is distributed to be used in home heating oil, as it is often in the
Northeast to ensure that the fuel does not gel.
      The White House is pursuing the change because "some wholesale
distributors of diesel fuel have not been paying the tax on kerosene
that they blend with diesel fuel for highway use," according to a
White House memo.  "As a result, the government is losing tax revenues
and complying taxpayers are at a competitive disadvantage."
      The Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America (SIGMA)
concurs with the Administration on the kerosene tax.  "People are
using the kerosene for fuel, and that is a form of tax evasion -- and
we are always against tax evasion," said SIGMA counsel Tim Columbus.
      Another gasoline marketer association, Petroleum Marketers
Association of America (PMAA),  is "totally opposed to this," said
PMAA spokesman David Morehead.  "This is not something we want to
allow to slip through."  PMAA is encouraging its members to contact
their Congressmen on the issue. 
      House and Senate members from Northeast states have sent letters
to Senate Majority leader Bob Dole (R-KS), asking him to oppose
Clinton's proposal.  "This would be an extremely regressive tax that
would have its greatest impact on low-income consumers of home heating
oil, many of whom live in trailer parks and cannot afford any increase
in fuel costs," the House letter read.
      "[The Clinton Administration] is charging that this is a tax-
break for businesses. We think this is a good business deduction,"
Morehead said.  "[Clinton is] taking the issue almost personally." 
      Taxation of aviation jet fuel also hangs in the balance.  On
Oct. 1, 1995, the Treasury began to collect the 4.3 c/gal tax on jet
fuel that had been exempted from the 1993 increase in the federal
fuels excise tax.  Extension of that exemption was included in the
Congressional budget bill that was vetoed last month, but it remains
on the table as part of the budget negotiations.

Congress Wants New Depreciation For C-Stores; Clinton Opposes

      A provision in the budget bill passed by Congress and vetoed by
the president last month would give convenience store (c-store) owners
that do more than 50% of their business in motor fuels and related
services the same 15-year depreciation schedule that gasoline stations
have.  Currently, those c-stores must use a 39.5-year depreciation
schedule.
      SIGMA, PMAA and the National Association of Convenience Stores
(NACS) support quicker depreciation.  Acknowledging that the Clinton
Administration has opposed the new schedule, Lindsay Hutter, NACS
spokeswoman, argues, "It has not been an issue of great contention in
the budget debate.
      "We have had the commitment of the Republican leadership on this
issue," Hutter said.  "We continue to be very hopeful -- this is our
number one issue."  

Tax For LUST Fund Expires, Extension of Tax Unlikely

      The 0.1 c/gal gasoline tax used to finance the LUST fund expired
on Dec. 31, and it appears no major effort is underway to restore it. 
Approximately $800 million is now in the trust fund, but it is not
being properly disbursed for cleanups, according to PMAA's Morehead. 
"Money in the LUST fund is just sitting there --  it hasn't been spent
very vigorously," he said.
      As for the tax, "we say 'let it expire' because the money is not
being used for what it should be used for," said Morehead.  PMAA might
favor restoration of the tax if the money was distributed to the
states, he said.  
      "SIGMA and NACS may try to reposition the LUST, but we would
want the federal government to give the money to the states, provided
they would use it for cleanup costs," concurred Columbus.

Superfund Tax Expires;  Lack Of Appropriations Slows Cleanups

      The tax collected for the Superfund Trust fund also expired as
of Dec. 31.  The $9.7 c/bbl, or $0.0023 c/gal, tax is not currently
being collected, but it will almost certainly be re-imposed
retroactively, according to Capitol Hill sources.
      In the meantime, the Superfund program is undergoing a partial
shutdown due to the lack of an EPA appropriations bill.  The trust
fund currently has a surplus of $4 billion, but it is receiving no new
revenue, according to Paul Hirsch of the Chemical Manufacturers
Association (CMA).
      "Work is continuing at sites where construction has started,"
Hirsch said, noting that there are two types of sites: those where the
government is performing the cleanup and those where the liable
parties are cleaning the site.  Liable parties will continue their
clean-up efforts.
      While some EPA Superfund employees are furloughed, the majority
of clean-up is performed by outside contractors, many of which are
still being paid through the trust fund, Hirsch said.  "The government
isn't going to ask those contractors to pick up their shovels and
leave," he said.  At sites that present an immediate threat to human
health, removal work will definitely continue.
      EPA officials offer a less optimistic view, saying that the lack
of funding will likey shut down most of the Superfund program.  The
agency is in the process of furloughing approximately 2,400 agency
workers and 10,000 contractors in the program.  EPA officials did
confirm that cleanup will continue at approximately 100 emergency
sites.

TOSCO BRACES ITSELF FOR COLD RECEPTION AT MARCUS HOOK

      BP is shutting down shop at Marcus Hook, PA, after an
overwhelming 83% rejection last Thursday of new owner Tosco's proposed
labor contract by union workers; and now Tosco says the prospect of
restarting the cold 185,000 b/d plant may prove too chilly to
contemplate. 
      Since buying the Marcus Hook plant and a retail system from BP
last November for $75 million, plus the $160 million value of the
inventories, Tosco expects to assume a cold refinery Feb. 1, when it
takes possession of the plant.
      "Since the union voted to reject the Tosco proposal, we are
continuing plans to suspend operations at Marcus Hook beginning in
mid-January and transferring the suspended operations over to Tosco on
February 1," said BP spokesperson Marian Lowes, declining to comment
on the unit's current utilization. 
      "We failed to reach an agreement with the union," said Jefferson
Allen, Tosco spokesman.  "Although that does mean we can now hire new
employees, it doesn't mean that we will open the plant ever.  We
expected to acquire an operating refinery, but we must now reevaluate
the costs and benefits of running the plant."
      For now, Tosco expects to use its 215,000- b/d Bayway, NJ,
refinery to supply the retail system in the Northeast it will also
acquire from BP.  "We've reached no conclusions about what we're going
to do," Allen added. 
      The plant's union, which represents 320 of its 520 employees,
sharply criticized the Tosco proposal presented on Dec. 31, and denied
that the company made any attempt to bargain.  "It has taken labor
relations back 30-40 years," charged Bob Burdick, International OCAW
representative.  "The document was not negotiated, it was issued by
the company.  Tosco refused to negotiate." 
      Nevertheless, the plant's union agreed to hold a secret ballot
vote on the plan last Thursday, at Tosco's request.  Chief among the
union's complaints with the proposal is the inclusion of mandated
selective hiring, which would "totally negate seniority -- a very
important subject for unions," explained Burdick. Also, the plan would
remove 30 positions from the union's collective bargaining group, lay
off 65 hourly-wage union members,  and eliminate 654 salaried
management-type positions.  It would allow some supervisors and other
salaried employees to bid on union jobs.    
      After the union membership rejected the plan, with only 16.8%
voting in favor of it, the shop steward said the negotiations are now
in Tosco's hands.  "The membership is not willing to go to work under
these conditions," said Cathy Brady, Marcus Hook OCAW shop steward.
      Employees at two of Tosco's other three refineries are also
represented by OCAW, and Burdick contends Tosco's Marcus Hook proposal
compares unfavorably with the union-Tosco contracts at Avon, WA, and
Ferndale, CA.  "This contract is much different and much more
stringent," he said.  "The management-rights clause in the Marcus Hook
proposal gives Tosco almost unlimited power, which is not normal for
such a clause.  Normally, the company is subject to the conditions of
the union contract."

PIPELINES WARY ABOUT MMT BLENDS

      Though Ethyl Corp. has received regulatory approval to market
MMT in the U.S., pipeline operators have yet to embrace the
introduction of yet another fuel additive into an already-stressed
transportation system.  No pipeline has yet changed its gasoline
specification to accomodate MMT blends, though none have indicated
opposition to the additive, either.
      Colonial Pipeline, the key mover of gasoline from the Gulf Coast
to the East, has requested input from its shippers as to whether it
should develop a set of specifications for MMT-blended gasoline. 
"Some shippers have indicated to us that they are not interested in
MMT," said William Copenhaver of Colonial.  "We're just trying to be
cautious." 
      Colonial is not suggesting that it has found technical problems
in shipping MMT-blended gasoline, said Copenhaver, only that it's
trying to understand the needs of its market.  The pipeline system
would allow a segregated shipment of MMT-blended gasoline now, but
Copenhaver said he is unaware of any customer requests.
      MMT, which can be blended only into conventional gasoline, will
be added at the refinery gate, according to Ethyl.  This creates a
"Catch 22" situation: Getting the support of common-carrier pipelines
is essential to broad market acceptance of MMT, but those pipelines
may withhold their support until the market demands the product.  In
response, Ethyl has contacted pipelines and supports the polling of
customers about their MMT plans and concerns, said Ethyl's Technical
Manger, Fuels, Don Hollrah.
      Allowing MMT blends into the fungible system would require
Colonial to add another entire set of gasoline grades, which it is
loath to do on top of the series of gasoline and diesel grades created
in response to new environmental regulations since 1993.
      Responses are due from shippers by Jan. 12, and Colonial will
announce its intentions "soon after," said Copenhaver.  This decision
will set the tone for other pipelines, add industry sources.

ENERGY BIOSYSTEMS PATENTS DESULFURIZATION BREAKTHROUGHS 

      A breakthrough in Energy BioSystems Corp.'s development of
biocatalytic desulfurization is bringing a six-to-eight-fold increase
in specific critical intermediate reactions, the company reported,
predicting it will be ready for commercial demonstration in early
1996.  The Houston-based company also received two new process design
patents for its proprietary biocatalytic desulfurization systems (BDS)
that use bacteria to remove sulfur from petroleum. 
      While Energy BioSystems scientists were experienced with the
interplay of three factors in the intermediate reactions,  the recent
enhancements in the process reflect the company's greater mastery over
a fourth factor discovered in September.   Company scientists are now
working to determine what effect the more prolific reactions will have
on the overall sulfur yield. 
      More development is required on a final reaction to produce the
prototype biocatalyst necessary for pilot plant demonstrations planned
for middle distillate streams at one of Total Petroleum's refineries,
the company said.  BDS will be later be applied to crude, naphtha and
other gasoline components. 
      As for Energy BioSystems' newest patents, the first (U.S. No.
5,472,875) claims a new reactor design by which air or oxygen-enriched
gas is introduced into the oil prior to treatment with the
biocatalyst.  The second patent (U.S. No. 5,468,626) claims a method
by which a biosorption agent preferentially absorbs sulfur-containing
compounds from petroleum.  Such a process design could reduce the size
of the bioreactor by concentrating on those compounds requiring
desulfurization, thus reducing capital equipment costs, the company
reported.

CHEVRON, VENEZUELA'S MARAVEN PARTNERSHIP TO PUSH ASPHALT 

      Maraven S.A. and Chevron Corp. have formed a 20-year alliance
that will bring Chevron substantial crude supplies to run its three
asphalt-oriented refineries in the U.S. and expand its marketing of
asphalt products in the western U.S.  The U.S. partnership is named
Chevron Ven Asphalt Alliance.
      Under the agreement, Chevron will operate Maraven's property in
Venezuela's Boscan oil field and Maraven will in turn supply crude oil
to Chevron's asphalt refineries in Perth Amboy, NJ, Portland, OR, and
Richmond Beach, WA.  "Boscan crude, with an API gravity of 10 degrees,
is an excellent asphalt feedstock," said David O'Reilly, president of
Chevron USA Products Co. 
      Chevron's investment in the heavy oil fields will improve
production from 80,000 b/d today to 115,000 b/d, will reach about $2
billion, the company estimates.

PARAMOUNT PETROLEUM CONTINUES DOWNSTREAM RESTRUCTURING

      Paramount Petroleum launched the next phase of its operations
restructuring to shift its emphasis away from light-end products to
asphalt, jet fuel, diesel fuel and intermediate product refining.  The
company's latest efforts have idled certain downstream units, but
Paramount says it will retain the option of resuming hydro processing. 
"For now it is important that Paramount focus on its core business,
and continue to provide high-quality products and customer service,"
said Jerrel Barto, Paramount chairman.
      Paramount's restructuring began last September when it acquired
EOTT Energy Corp.'s West Coast asphalt marketing operation, senior
management team and technical staff.  At the same time, Paramount
terminated its processing agreement with EOTT, paid off its long-term
debt, entered into a long-term crude oil supply arrangement with EOTT,
obtained long-term financing from Bank of Boston and received a
substantial capital investment from EOTT, Paramount reported.

ASSESSING THE FUTURE OF CNG IN AN RFG WORLD

      Compressed natural gas (CNG) has been studied and tested
extensively as an alternative transportation fuel.  It has beeen used
in passenger car fleets, public transit vehicles and in some heavy-
duty equipment with spark-ignition systems replacing diesel fuel.  But
even so, the public understands the fuel characteristics of RFG and
diesel fuel far better than those of CNG.
      Nevertheless, CNG must be considered as one of the backup
transportation fuels of the next century.  It has the support of the
U.S. Department of Energy and is probably more compatible with the oil
and automobile industries than battery power.  However, as long as
crude oil moves freely in commerce throughout the world, CNG vehicle
development will be slow.  Future RFG, along with advances in
emissions control, can compete environmentally with CNG.

Natural Gas As A Stable Energy Source: Economic Factors

      As a fossil fuel, natural gas follows coal as the most plentiful
energy resource of the U.S.  Crude oil is in a distant third place,
and the U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on imports.  At the
same time, methane, the major constituent of CNG, can be generated
from coal, tar sands, crude oil and, to some extent, renewable
sources.  It offers long-term stability as an energy source.
      Today, the price of natural gas is set by competition with
residual fuel oil or coal as a burner fuel, and it varies considerably
with geography and season.  As a general rule, CNG is more economic
than RFG despite capital and operating costs for compression. 
Conversions to accomodate CNG are said to average about $4,000 per
passenger or van-type vehicle.
      Fuel economy comparisons between CNG and RFG are confusing at
best.  On a theoretical BTU/gallon basis, CNG has much less to offer
than RFG.  On a BTU/lb of vapor basis, the heat content is more
comparable, but varies with individual CNG and RFG composition.  One
study with Caprice and Crown Victoria taxicabs conducted by Clean Air
Cab Co. indicated CNG "average fuel economy is equal to or better than
gasoline."  The study also also indicated a 20-month payback on
conversions.  

Composition and Emissions Performance

      In general, treated natural gas ranges from 80% to 98% methane,
with varying amounts of ethane, propane, inert gases (carbon dioxide
and nitrogen) and traces of heavier hydrocarbons.  EPA certification
fuel is specified at the bottom of Table I and is more restrictive
than some pipeline gas delivered for heating.  The heavier
hydrocarbons are necessarily limited for CNG due to the danger of
liquid formation.
      CNG's high methane content insures clean burning and a low level
of non-methane emissions.  Heavier hydrocarbons emitted, primarily
ethane and propane, are low in photochemical activity.
      Toxic emissions, such as benzene and 1,3 butadiene, are almost
non-existent, especially when catalytic converter controlled. 
However, the reactivity of emissions from compressed fuel can increase
if the C2 and C3 fractions contain olefins from refinery cracking
operations.  Olefin limits could be set on future CNG certification
fuel as an added environmental control.  (The California Air Resources
Board current limits the amount of propylene in LPG at 10 vol%, to be
reduced to 5 vol% on Jan. 1, 1997.)

Octane Quality

      The octane quality of most CNG compositions exceeds 120 (R+M)/2. 
However, the inherent value of the excess octane is currently lost
because vehicles converted to CNG are not designed with higher
compression engines that could offer additional fuel economy or
greater performance.
      An advanced natural gas vehicle developed by an industry
consortium, headed by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics
Laboratory, does incorporate a modified small displacement, high-
compression engine.  The compact-sized, four-door sedan is said to
have a 315-mile driving range between refueling and fuel economy of 32
miles per (equivalent) gallon.

Fuel Tanks and Fueling

      Two major disadvantages for CNG passenger cars are the larger
space needed for fuel tanks and the availability of compressed gas for
fueling.  The Johns Hopkins prototype is said to retain 75% of the
original trunk storage space, which means that the rear has been
redesigned for fuel storage and lacks space for a spare tire and jack. 
Instead, the car is equipped with "run flat tires" which can be driven
up to 250 miles with no damage after puncture.
      Fueling time and availability is a major problem that needs
resolution before the average motorist can become serious about CNG,
and limited fleet operations can be expanded.
      Yet, in a world that would place a significant number of CNG
vehicles on the road, solutions can be visualized.  For example,
natural gas available through conventional systems for industrial and
home heating could be the fuel source.  Compression equipment and
tankage could be installed at large service stations or vehicle repair
shops.  Also, it is conceivable that compressors and small tanks could
be installed in the home garage, assuming safety problems could be
resolved.
      However, in the home-supply case, the gas delivered through the
heating system would need to meet CNG fuel specifications.  Natural
gas for home heating contains a minute amount of odorant, such as
mercaptan sulfur.  The material is added to facilitate leak detection
and could probably be removed with a filtering device connected to the
compression equipment.

Long-Range Outlook

      Prospects are slim for a CNG share of vehicle transportation
from the average motorist.  He or she is not likely to trade fueling
convenience and trunk space for lower-cost mileage.  Further, the
economic advantage for CNG over RFG would probably be lost (through
rising demand and added road taxes) if gas-powered vehicles were
mandated in critical air pollution areas such as the Los Angeles
Basin.  Also, as long as zero-emission vehicles are scheduled and
mandated in California, the major emphasis of automakers will be on
development of battery-powered cars.
      Future RFG, along with more extensive catalytic conversion, is
also competition for CNG from the standpoint of cost-effective
emissions reductions.
      On the other hand, as long as fuel economics favor CNG and
facilitate a short-term payout of conversion equipment, as well as
offer long-term, low-cost mileage, compressed gas will be attractive
for fleet operation -- especially in critical air pollution zones. 
Therefore, CNG and CNG vehicles can be viewed as a niche market that
will experience gradual growth.

SANCTIONS AGAINST NIGERIA COULD SEND OIL PRICES SOARING

      Elimination of Nigeria's oil production from world markets
through a boycott would push oil prices sharply higher and have a
particularly severe impact on heating oil and diesel fuel because of
the uniquely high distillate nature of Nigerian crudes, said Cheryl
Trench, executive vice president, Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation (New York, NY).  OECD countries, led by the U.S., would be
most affected, as they account for 90% of Nigeria's export market, or
more than 1.5 million b/d.
      "As everybody is well aware, this is not an issue under hot
debate in the U.S. right now," said Trench.  "But it is under
consideration in the U.S. Congress and internationally."
      With the world having perhaps 3.5 million b/d of spare oil
production capacity today, two-thirds of that in Saudi Arabia, Trench
believes that prices would rise during the substantial time lag before
supplies were redistributed around the world in accordance with
demand.  "Even if  it were, however, the incremental crude would not
match the quality of Nigerian crudes, with their high yields of light
products in general, and particularly high yield of gasoil," she
wrote.
      The last time when light crudes were at a premium, during the
U.S. Operation Desert Storm, refiners that had to use heavy crudes
wound up increasing refinery runs to make up deficits -- and the same
thing would occur in this case.  "Uncertainty over the availability of
incremental supplies will encourage inventory holding, the phenomenon
that unbalanced markets in 1979," she added.
      Even a unilateral embargo by only the U.S. would affect the
market noticeably, Trench predicted.  For one thing, U.S. East Coast
gasoline and heating oil inventories are lower this year than in years
past, so any production shortfall would be felt "quickly and strongly
in product prices."  The redirection of near-substitutes for Nigerian
crude (such as North Sea production) to the U.S. would change trade
patterns and contribute to a widening of crude-grade splits.
      The impact of a boycott in the U.S. would fall
disproportionately on several refiners, PIRF found: Sun, which is 100%
dependent on Nigerian crude to run its Philadelphia refinery complex;
BP, which relies on the crude for 70% of its feed at Marcus Hook, PA,
a facility it is soon turning over to Tosco; and Hess, which uses
large volumes of Nigerian crude at its Virgin Islands complex.

ABB GROUP SCORES SUCCESSES IN FORMER SOVIET UNION

      During the last few months, Switzerland's ABB Group moved ahead
of other Western engineering companies backing the growth of the
refining industry in the former Soviet Union.
      In November, ABB Lummus Global, a division of ABB Group, helped
arrange a $96 million loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for
further modernization of a refinery in Perm, Russia.  ABB Lummus will
manage the project, which will expand production of low-aromatics (10
vol%) diesel fuel, increase yield of high-value products and reduce SO2
emissions by 30%.  The refinery is already Russia's top producer of
lubricant oils and has been making an all-unleaded gasoline slate
since March 1993.
      Separately, ABB Simcon signed an agreement with Petrocom of
Moscow, to cooperate in supplying the refining industry with
automation systems, dynamic simulators and related services.

GASOLINE, HEATING OIL PRICES IMPROVE DESPITE INVENTORY BUILDS

      Fuel traders appeared to shake off American Petroleum Institute
(API) data that indicated gasoline and distillate inventories
increased substantially in the last week of 1995, instead driving Gulf
Coast gasoline up nearly 4 c/gal since late December.  For the week
ended Dec. 30, 1995, gasoline inventories incresaed 5.1 million bbl.
      Distillate stocks increased 1.2 million bbl, but that was
entirely due to a rise in on-road diesel, as the cold weather took a
large bit out of heating oil inventories.  As a result, spot prices
for high-sulfur diesel fuel ended last week even with on-road diesel
at 61 c/gal in New York and 55.6 c/gal in Houston.
      Concentrating on a huge drawdown in crude oil inventories of
11.4 million bbl, traders said that the trends of higher product
demand are more important than a one-week fluctuation in product
stocks at a time of year when inventories are sometimes manipulated
for tax purposes.  
      News Friday morning that refinery workers at BP's Marcus Hook,
PA, facility rejected the contract offer by Tosco helped gasoline
prices in the East as the week ended.  If BP proceeds with its
decision to close the refinery in the absence of a new contract when
it turns it over to Tosco on Jan. 31, product from the172,000-b/d
facility would come to a halt.  However, sources indicate that the
plant has been running "at maybe half capacity" for a considerable
period of time and that the new owner, Tosco, could increase
production at its Bayway, NJ, refinery to make up for any shortfalls
from the Marcus Hook plant.
      Also aiding the market late last week were stoppages in some
crude shipments  because of severe winter storms.  Coastal  announced
that its Corpus Christi, TX, refinery was scaling back operations
about 20% due to reduced crude shipments from the Gulf of Mexico
because of the weather.  Shell reduced operations at Deer Park, TX, by
an undisclosed amount for the same reason.
      MTBE prices have stalled in the past several weeks, due to light
trading interest and sufficient supplies, after performing strongly in
the first three weeks of December.  Spot Gulf Coast MTBE held at 92
c/gal last week, said sources, who added that they do not see any
events on the mid-term horizon that will affect prices.  Methanol
contracts rolled over unchanged from December to January at 42 c/gal,
with spot prices at discounts of as much as 10 c/gal from those
levels.
      Ethanol prices were also unchanged at spot levels, though some
Midwest marketers reported that rack rates increased by 1-2 c/gal in a
reflection of stronger rack gasoline prices.
      Crude price gains were attributed to expectations of continued
strong product demand.

CDTECH PIONEERS SAFER, SMARTER BENZENE UNIT FOR TEXACO

      CDTECH is licensing its first application of CDHydrosm for the
selective hydrogenation of benzene in reformate feedstocks for Texaco
Refining and Marketing Inc.'s Bakersfield, CA, plant to provide a less
expensive way for the refiner to meet its CARB Phase 2 RFG gasoline
requirements.
      The technology provides an economic way for Bakersfield to
produce a high-octane component, since it lacks a catalytic cracker. 
The plant has 16,000 b/d of low-pressure catalytic reforming capacity.
      CDHydro technology, said to be the first of its kind, is
designed to replace the standard fixed-bed hydrogenation and
conventional distillation units in one single proprietary catalytic
distillation unit.  The Texaco contract will mark the first commercial
use of a combined, single-step reaction and fractionation of benzene,
allowing cheaper, lower-pressure and safer operating conditions, said
Tom Hickey, director of marketing and operations, CDTECH.  
      While gasoline benzene specifications continue to be more
stringent worldwide, CDHydro hydrogenates benzene into cyclohexane,
considered to be more environmentally innocuous.  The new technology
operates isothermally, thus eliminating the concern of temperature-
rise common in fixed-bed reactor systems.  Another advantage is that
the technology utilizes commercially available catalyst.
      Also,  standard fixed-bed units require a larger volume of
hydrocarbons in processing because they use more equipment for
processing them.  CDHydro utilizes just one column already present in
the refinery eliminating the need for additional hydrocarbon
inventory.  "This reduces the ultimate residence time of the liquid
and limits hydrocarbon holdup," Hickey said.
      The technology has been commercially available since mid-1994,
and may be installed either as a retrofit or a new column.  Although
it may not be universally useful to all refiners, Hickey said, "we
expect to see a fair number of applications, but that really depends
on a case-by-case basis.  However, 100%" of everyone that has to build
a new reformate splitter can benefit. 
      "We will probably see wide utilization in Europe because of the
strict new environmental regulations on benzene," Hickey said.  "Many
refiners will require new reformate splitters to remove benzene, and
in those applications, CDHydro is a natural." 
      Texaco recently installed a new, 7,200-b/d reformate splitter
column at Bakersfield to produce California Phase 2 RFG, which will
utilize the CDHydro technology.  Currently, the 56,000-b/d refinery
does not produce any RFG, either Federal or California.  Texaco
declined to comment on the projected savings it expects to glean from
the CDHydro technology or the amount of RFG it plans to produce.  The
upgrade won't alter the plant's overall crude capacity, however. 
      Other options for eliminating benzene include pre-fractionation
for precursors, post-fractionation, removing the benzene for sale, and
alkylation.  CDTECH developed the technology based on its similar
applications for butadiene hydrogenation for C4 streams.
