                      Contract DE-FC01-93RW00282 (Since 1988)</H3>
<P>
The Western Interstate Energy Board (WIEB) is an organization of eleven western states
(Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah,
Washington, and Wyoming), the state of Hawaii, and three western Canadian Provinces which
are associate members of the Board. The governor of each state appoints a member to the
Board. The purpose of the Board is to provide the instruments and framework for cooperative
state efforts to "enhance the economy of the West and contribute to the well-being of the
region's people."  The Board seeks to achieve this purpose through cooperative efforts among
member states/provinces and with the federal government in the energy field.  The High-Level
Radioactive Waste Committee members include WIEB's eleven western state members plus
Idaho.
