FDA to Draft New Approval Guidance For Medical
Software Regulation


To judge whether a software program needs premarket
notification or approval, the FDA may use criteria such as
seriousness of the disease to be diagnosed or treated; time frame
for use of the information; and concordance with accepted medical
practice.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will draft a new software
regulation policy, following controversy in the information systems
industry over the agency's efforts to clarify its 1989 draft policy
(IMS 9/7/95, p. 2).
Some industry representatives feel the FDA is on the right track.
If the revised  policy creates a category for those products that
need little or no regulation, it could mean an easier approval
process for vendors and more technology reaching the users quicker.
While some stand-alone software products such as hospital
information systems and picture archiving and communication systems
do not pose a threat to patients if they fail, they are medical
devices under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and should be
regulated as such, says Dr. Harvey Rudolph, acting deputy director
of the FDA Office of Science and Technology.
Although the FDA guidance aims to identify products that do not
require 510(k) premarket notification, the guidance created more
confusion than clarification, Rudolph admits.
FDA uses the concept of "competent human intervention" to determine
whether a product poses an immediate danger to patients if it
fails. As long as a qualified person, such as a physician, has
control over system output, there is competent human intervention.
The problem, Rudolph says, is manufacturers have interpreted
competent human intervention too broadly.
One system's experience: Base Ten Systems of Trenton, N.J.,
originally submitted a premarket notification for its prenatal
evaluation computer software program, Prenval. But the approval
process took several years because of FDA's inexperience at
regulating software, contends Walter Brandes, company vice
president.
After Base Ten had submitted the request for notification, FDA said
the company needed to go through the lengthier premarket approval
process. But FDA's peer reviewers, in looking over the company's
paperwork, downgraded the product to a 510(k), says Brandes.
The agency wants to develop three levels of device review based on
criteria that determine the impact of product failure on the
patient. 

The criteria include:

o         Seriousness of the disease to be
diagnosed or treated; 
o         Time frame for use of the
information; 
o         Concordance with accepted medical
practice; 
o         Format of data and their
presentation; 
o         Individualized vs. aggregate
patient care recommendations; and 
o         Clarity of the algorithm.

The agency hopes to publish in three to six months a new draft in
the Federal Register.

Hospital Overhauls Information System To Adopt
Client-Server Environment


Hermann Hospital of Houston is reworking its information system,
leaving its mainframe behind and moving to a client-server environment
that makes information more accessible to the end-user.

Tired of the lack of communication between the components of its
budding integrated delivery system, one Texas hospital decided to
rework its entire information system.
Hermann Hospital of Houston embarked on a three-year initiative to
phase in a system to create an electronic medical record accessible
from all parts of its network, says CIO David Tucker.
Phase one: pilot tests at five or six University of Texas clinics
associated with the hospital. After phase one is complete, the
hospital will focus on integrating other departments, such as
nursing, into the network.
The hospital operates in a mainframe environment, using the
Envision system developed by SMS of Malvern, Pa. Hermann is moving
to a client-server environment that makes information more
accessible to the end-user, Tucker says.
The paperless, client-server system will eliminate the need for
duplicate medical records scattered around the network.
For example, if a patient goes into a clinic in the morning, then
goes to the Hermann emergency room that night, physicians in the ER
have no way of knowing about the encounter that morning and will
draw up a new chart, Tucker says.
Hermann will implement the Health Network Architecture developed by
Cerner Corp. of Kansas City, Mo., to link its network. 
The computerized patient medical records will be stored using
Cerner's Open Clinical Foundation Data Repository. 
Hermann also will implement Cerner's CareNet Care Management System
and Open Management Foundation Data Repository.
When implemented, the system will link about 2,000 devices,
including workstations and printers, located at about 60 clinics in
the area. The system will run on a Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC)
platform and will use Oracle.
Hermann hopes to have the first pilot systems in place by
September.
Tucker foresees complications common to new systems: Hermann staff
has never used the DEC platform or Oracle.

Health Groups Collaborate To Prove Telemedicine's Worth


A new telemedicine research center gives members access to
research databases - and the opportunity to participate in projects
to prove the benefits of telemedicine.

To help prove the clinical utility and cost- effectiveness of
telemedicine, an Oregon research  center launched a group to
cooperate on telemedicine projects nationwide.
The Telemedicine Research Center, a non-profit research corporation
based in Portland, Ore., organized the Clinical Telemedicine
Cooperative Group. The intent: advance telemedicine research
through a cooperative approach to clinical telemedicine trials,
says Mary McDermott, client services manager.
Health care facilities looking to launch their own telemedicine
programs but don't know where to start could benefit from the
research of others.
The group uses e-mail to communicate with members. Members also can
download evaluation tools and training materials based on other
ongoing telemedicine projects.
Members can access research, design and data management protocols,
and other telemedicine information. Members also can conceive,
develop and participate in telemedicine research studies.
Members include East Carolina University, Iowa Health System,
Midwest Rural Telemedicine Consortium, Oregon Health Sciences
University, and the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materials
Command's Medical Advanced Technology Management Office.
In addition to the cooperative group, the center maintains a World
Wide Web home page that links users to other telemedicine Web sites
(see Surfing the 'Net, p. 7).
Contact McDermott at (503) 221-1620, or the research center at
trc@telemed.org on the Internet.

Group Outlines Special License For MDs Doing Telemedicine


The interstate practice of telemedicine may get easier if
a proposal by the Federation of State Medical Boards becomes law.

The Federation of State Medical Boards, based in Euless, Texas,
drafted a model act calling for the establishment of a special
license limited to the interstate practice of medicine, such as
telemedicine (IMS 11/2/95, p. 1).
The group has presented the draft document for recommendation to
state medical boards.
Findings: Physicians practicing medicine across state lines are
either unregulated or must be fully licensed in the state where the
patient is located.
However, some states still feel that a full and unrestricted
license is necessary for the interstate practice of medicine, says
Dr. James Winn, federation executive vice president.

Model Act Is a Step in the Right Direction

While states don't have to adopt the guidance, the proposal does
move toward breaking down the barriers to telemedicine, says Tim
Henderson, director of the Primary Care Resource Center at George
Washington University's Intergovernmental Health Policy Project in
Washington. There is a need for a joint effort to deal with the
fast growth of telemedicine, he says.
The creation of a nationwide licensure standard is so far off that
it is impossible to determine how the act  would affect legislative
efforts in the future, he notes. Henderson suggests seeing how the
effort works in a few states before trying broader implementation.
The proposed act would require physicians engaging in telemedicine
and any interstate practice of medicine to obtain a special license
issued by the state medical board. The license would not allow the
physician to enter the state to practice medicine.
The act would only require those physicians who regularly engage in
the practice of medicine across state lines to obtain a license,
and would exempt physicians in the case of an emergency.
The definitions of "regularly" and "emergency" would be determined
by the board in each state.
The committee further recommends that every consideration for
expedient issuance of the limited medical license be given to
physicians holding a valid, unrestricted license in one state.
The committee plans to meet again at the end of March to finalize
the document.

Hospital Cuts Paper Chase Out of System Buy Process


A New York hospital used a 13-member committee to evaluate
on-site demonstrations, interview counterparts at other user
hospitals and rate vendor documentation.

In its search for a new information system, a New York hospital
found an alternative to the usual paper-intensive process of
submitting a request for proposal (RFP) to vendors.
Brooks Memorial Hospital of Dunkirk, N.Y., first sent out a request
for information to 13 vendors and narrowed the choice to seven.
An RFP involves a great deal of paperwork on both sides and is not
filled with information that prospective buyers can really use,
says Vince Ciotti of HIS Professionals of Boonton, N.J., Brooks'
information systems consultant.
Hospital CFO Ralph Webdale chaired a 13-member committee that
included physicians and representa-tives from nursing, billing,
accounting and pharmacy departments. 
For one day a week, each of the seven vendors did on-site demos in
each department.
Committee members independently rated each vendor's software
package, then discussed the systems' strengths and weaknesses as a
group.
A vital element of the review process was the telephone reference,
Webdale says. Each committee member spoke to their counterparts at
hospitals that had installed the vendors' products, then rated and
discussed each product based on the conversations.
The final step was to rate the documentation of the top six vendors
based on criteria such as ease-of-use.
In the end, the committee came to a unanimous decision to buy a
Meditech system.
Tip: One of the criteria Ciotti uses to put together a list of
potential vendors is location. Some hospitals have spent up to
$100,000 flying vendors in for demos or for service, Ciotti says.
Contact Ciotti at (201) 263-4795, or Webdale at (716) 366-1111.

Clinic Tracks Utilization Through Electronic Record


The system collects patient demographics data at
registration on an IBM AS/400  workstation linked to the central
database and automatically updates the patient record. Billing
information is sent in daily batches to the database. The system
runs on a Novell 4.0 network.

To track patient utilization and improve allocation of resources,
a multisite Iowa provider group decided to use a computerized
medical record system.
The Iowa Physicians Clinic Medical Foundation will install
computerized medical record systems in about 15 sites around the
state, according to Dr. Mark Purtle, director of internal medicine.
The group chose the MR 2000 computerized medical record program
developed by Healthcare Software Solutions, a subsidiary of Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa, based in Des Moines.
The group has patient record systems up and running, although only
in partial installation, in about half of its sites. 
While the MR 2000 includes modules for finance, health maintenance,
drug formularies and drug interactions, the group uses the system
primarily for demographics and patient encounter information.

Registration System Collects Demographics

Patient demographics data is collected at registration on an IBM
AS/400 workstation linked to the central database. The system
automatically updates the patient record. Billing information is
sent in daily batches to the database.
The system runs on a Novell 4.0 network.
Instead of entering encounter notes directly into the record,
physicians record notes, which are then transcribed and entered
into the record. 
The system also includes a ICD-9 and CPT-4 coding module, but
coding is still not widespread among physicians, Purtle notes.
All clinic sites can access records stored in the central database.
However, each site maintains a server with its own records.
Workstations are located at all physician offices, nurse stations
and registration desks. When the system is fully installed, there
will be workstations in every exam room.
Caveat: The electronic medical record has not yet eliminated the
need for a paper record. The group may use a scanner to create
electronic images of the paper records.
The group hopes to build a complete database of codes and
demographics that tracks encounters by provider and clinic site. 
Being able to track seasonal variations in utilization would enable
the group to better plan the number of physicians it needs during
certain periods of the year or the type of physician it would need
in a certain  community.
According to Purtle, the implementation process has been slow. The
hold-up is due in part to physicians getting used to computers. In
addition, the group is awaiting release of a Windows version of the
software before continuing implementation.
The group hopes to have the system fully implemented at all its
sites by the end of the year.
Contact Purtle at (515) 241-4000.

Automated Prepayment Screen Could Save Millions, GAO Says


HCFA says half of Medicare Part B contractors have
installed the screening tools, but Congress hasn't appropriated the
money to support the program. But GAO contends the tool could save
HCFA $150 million a year.

HCFA could save millions of dollars by using automated prepayment
screens for Medicare claims, according to a report released earlier
this month by the General Accounting Office.
A simple safeguard, known as an auto-adjudicated prepayment screen,
could save millions of dollars in unnecessary Medicare payments,
GAO officials said at a Feb. 8 House Government Reform and
Oversight Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations
Subcommittee hearing.
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), subcommittee chairman, said there
is very little reason why HCFA should not require the screens to be
used whenever possible.
While half of Medicare contractors have installed the screens, they
don't use them because of the limited funds appropriated by
Congress for medical review, according to Gary Kavanagh, deputy
director of HCFA's Bureau of Program Operations. Another obstacle:
lack of a nationwide standard payment policy, he added.
HCFA has three model policies in place to examine whether the
screens work and is planning more by the summer, Kavanagh said.
However, he expressed doubt that the screens would save a "whole
lot of money."
The GAO based its findings on claims for six common medical
procedures submitted to the seven largest Medicare Part B
contractors, and determined HCFA could save about $150 million on
those procedures alone.
The six procedures, which account for almost $3 billion in Medicare
payments, are echocardiography, eye exams, chest X-rays,
colonoscopy, YAG laser surgery and duplex scan of extracranial
arteries.

         The U.S. Department of Justice
indicted a group of Michigan medical suppliers for allegedly
defrauding Medicare of $25 million through an electronic billing
scheme. Through assorted companies, the suppliers allegedly
electronically billed Medicare's fiscal intermediary Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Michigan for questionable supplies, including kits
for catheters, incontinence and gastronomy tubes. The suppliers
allegedly back-dated claims and billed Medicare separately for
components of kits as well as the kits themselves. When Blue Cross
got suspicious and subjected claims to prepayment review, the
suppliers allegedly switched to provider identification numbers
that seemed unrelated to their companies, and billed Medicare
carriers in Florida and Ohio.

         The wide variation in the
information systems capabilities of health plans affects how
completely plans can report measures for the Health Plan Employer
Data and Information Set, according to the Committee on Performance
Measurement of the National Committee for Quality Assurance. At a
recent meeting of the committee, members concluded that the best
strategy is to design measures for HEDIS 3.0, set for release this
summer, that many plans can produce with current information
systems, but that would provide users, over time, with information
they need for measurement. Contact NCQA at (202) 955-3500.

         HCFA on Feb.5 issued a call for
comments on its proposed automated National Provider System for
collecting health care information. The system will be used in
program operations and management to assign provider identification
numbers, such as billing numbers for claims processing and payment.
For a copy of the proposal, call (410) 786-1326. Send comments and
recommendations to OMB Human Resources and Housing Branch,
Attention: Allison Eydt, New Executive Office Building, Room 10235,
Washington, D.C. 20503.

         A draft HHS budget proposal may
expand rural telemedicine grants to rural primary care hospitals
and sole community hospitals.

         The National Health Council of
Washington and Chicago-based America's House Call Network entered
into a strategic alliance to disseminate health information to
consumers through the House Call network. The council will offer
members assistance in using the interactive services of the
network, including disease forums, chat rooms, health news and
interactive conferences. Contact the council at (202) 785-3910.

         The Uniform Code Council of Dayton,
Ohio, released a video and literature package that addresses the
product identification needs of the health care industry.
"Application Identifiers: At the Heart of Health Care Product
Identification" focuses on mapping data-structure requirements to
industry-defined business requirements. The video and accompanying
brochure describe product identification and bar-coding for
pharmaceutical and medical-surgical products. Contact the council
at (513) 435-3870.

         A coalition of state education,
military, health care and private sector groups has launched the
Texas Distance Learning Assn. to address, in part, the importance
of telemedicine. Contact the association at (512) 280-2500.

         A far greater percentage of rural
health care facilities than previously thought is using
telemedicine to access specialists at large urban health centers
for patient care, according to a study on telemedicine by Abt
Associates Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. The study was funded by the
Office of Rural Health Policy and tallied the responses of 2,365
facilities, or 95% of the nation's rural hospitals. According to
the study, 29% of facilities have adopted telemedicine programs,
ranging from teleradiology to interactive video, or plan to by the
end of the year; about 30% of telemedicine programs were created
within the last year and 30% between one and three years ago; of
the facilities with telemedicine programs, 66% seek out specialty
consultation, while 10% provide consultation services to others,
with the remainder serving in both capacities; and the average
rural hospital that seeks consultations from specialists using
telemedicine receives 15 teleconsultations each month. For more
information, contact Abt at (617) 492-7100.

SURFING THE 'NET
Telemedicine Web Site Offers Product Reviews


The Telemedicine Information Exchange World Wide Web site,
maintained by the Telemedicine Research Center of Portland, Ore.,
links users to a telemedicine products and services directory that
catalogs articles on equipment reviews, evaluations or technical
specs.
Once you choose a browser, you will have a selection of three
menus: (1) starters; (2) hot items; and (3) searchable databases.
From the starter menu, users can get the history and definition of
telemedicine, or read case studies on telemedicine in action and
the latest news, including legislative issues and success stories.
Users can also offer feedback on the site.
Under the hot items menu, users can explore the legal and ethical
issues surrounding telemedicine through the text of current state
legislation, peer-reviewed articles and hypertext links to other
Internet resources.
The searchable databases include information on funding for
telemedicine projects, active projects, and upcoming meetings and
conferences.
The site also offers information on the Telemedicine Research
Center's Clinical Telemedicine Cooperative Group that brings
together researchers nationwide (see story, p. 2).
The site's home page lets you choose a text-only or a graphic
browser, enabling users to sacrifice aesthetics for the sake of
speed.
The site is located at http://tie.telemed.org/ on the Web.
