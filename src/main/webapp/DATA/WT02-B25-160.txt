Independence, integration and productivity are among the most important values and goals shared by people with disabilities, their families, advocates, and service providers.  Any federal housing policy which affects the lives of people with disabilities must therefore reflect these values and be designed to achieve these goals.  The shortage of available, affordable, and accessible housing is an increasingly serious problem for people with disabilities that has limited their access to independent lives in the community, as well as their access to productive employment and full integration into society.

<P>Like all individuals, people with disabilities have a need for decent, safe, affordable, and appropriate housing.  Like all individuals, people with disabilities vary in their abilities, interests, desires, and needs over the span of their lifetime.  For some people with disabilities, the need for affordable housing directly linked with services and supports lasts throughout their lifetime.  For most people with disabilities, affordable housing simply means generic housing within the community, including rental apartments, condominiums, and single family homes.

<P>During the last decade, people with disabilities have become more empowered in all aspects of their daily lives.  Through the passage of important federal legislation, and with the support of advocates and service providers, many more people with disabilities have been able to rent or purchase a home of their own.  People with all types of disabilities are now living successfully in a variety of housing options, including apartments, cooperatives, condominiums, and single family homes.

<P>In order to afford housing in the community, low income people with disabilities have been seeking various forms of federal housing assistance in increasing numbers.  Unfortunately, at a time when demand is increasing, affordable housing opportunities for people with disabilities under age 62 are decreasing rather than expanding.  This decline is due primarily to the implementation of "elderly only" designated housing policies in federally subsidized housing as well as to severe cuts in federal housing programs.  To add to the problem, efforts underway at the state and federal level to restructure public welfare and health systems, such as SSI and Medicaid, are also putting pressure on other funding streams that people with disabilities rely on to help pay for housing.

<P>Given the decline in affordable housing units and funding for health and human services, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that the federal government and the nation's affordable housing delivery system must work in partnership with people with disabilities and advocates to develop and implement a clear and equitable federal housing policy that is responsive to their housing needs and desires.   If we do not move forward immediately, the housing "safety net" for people with disabilities will increasingly be inappropriate and costly institutionalization or the homeless system.  Tragically, people with disabilities are already significantly over-represented as a percentage of the population who live in emergency shelters or on the streets of our communities.
