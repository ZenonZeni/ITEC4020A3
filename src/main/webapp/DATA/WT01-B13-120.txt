  The performance of the U.S. financial markets during the next few quarters will be driven by the interaction between business cycle developments and the unfolding of  the 1996 election campaign. Monetary policy will be expansionary in most G-7 countries, but bond yields could fluctuate in a wide range because of changing investor perception of political and economic risk.  

<P>

  The large rise in U.S. bond yields since January suggests the market already is discounting several developments, including a moderate upturn in the economy, no further progress in resolving the fiscal deadlock in Washington, and a high probability of President Clinton winning re-election. European bond yields have risen partly in response to U.S. developments and partly because of investor apprehension about how the governments of Germany and France will resolve the contradictions in their program for European monetary union. Japanese bond yields have risen because of continuing evidence that the Japanese economy has bottomed as well as investor concern about the cost of future bank bail-outs on the government's fiscal deficit.  

<P>

  The uptick in bond yields during February and March was so sudden that some pundits began to make comparisons with the bond market collapse of 1994, but <B>it is doubtful that the cyclical revival in the U.S. economy this spring and summer will be as robust as the upturn which pushed U.S. bond yields over 8.0% two years ago.</B> In 1994, the economy enjoyed a spurt to 3.5% output growth from 2.2% because of 3.0% growth in personal consumption, 9.2% growth in business fixed investment and an inventory swing worth 0.6% of GDP. In 1996, the economy will probably enjoy 2.4% growth in consumer spending, 5.0-6.0% growth in business investment, and a stabilization of corporate inventories. But while output growth for the year as a whole will probably average only 2.5%, there could be a spurt to growth rates as high as 3.0- 3.5% during the second and third quarter, as the manufacturing sector shifts from inventory liquidation to inventory accumulation.  

<P>

  The 1994 rebound in the economy produced a large rise in capacity utilization rates and industrial commodity prices, so the Federal Reserve hiked U.S. short-term interest rates from 3.0% to 6.0%. If the coming rebound in output stabilizes with growth rates of 2.0-2.5% after one or two moderately stronger quarters, it will not have as dramatic an impact on commodity prices as the 1994 upturn. Capacity utilization rates have dropped back to 82.0% from 85.0% last year while new capacity is expanding at a 4.0% annual rate compared to only 2.0-2.5% during the early 1990's. There is a risk that the low level of unemployment will encourage some escalation of wage growth but the flexibility of the U.S. labor market will probably cause changes in wage compensation to occur gradually. <B>Unemployment has been at 4.0% in several mid-western states since 1994 and firms have still been successful at restraining costs.</B> In 1996, productivity also should improve as output growth recovers.  

<P>

  It is possible that the coming turn in the inventory cycle could produce such large income gains that consumer spending will rise sharply rather than moderately, but several factors suggest that the economy does not have the pent-up demand which existed after three years of sluggish growth between 1991 and 1994. The ratio of consumer debt to income has risen sharply and consumer delinquency rates on credit cards are back at the highs of 1990. While the delinquency rate on the total stock of consumer debt remains very subdued, <B>the uptick in the delinquency rate on cards could encourage some consumer finance companies to impose tighter credit standards after a prolonged period in which lending conditions became progressively easier.</B> As Federal Reserve Governor Larry Lindsey has warned, such a change in the credit environment could reduce the spending power of lower middle class households who lack discretionary income. The potentially new positive factor for consumer spending is the huge wealth gains which the household sector has enjoyed from the appreciation of equity prices. The capitalization of the U.S.- equity market has risen to $6.7 trillion or 87.5% of GDP compared to a seventy year average of 48% of GDP. Households own about two-thirds of all U.S. corporate equity, with one-third held in the form of mutual funds, IRA's, or defined benefit pension plans and two-thirds owned directly. Econometric research shows only a weak link between aggregate consumer spending and stock market gains because about 90% of U.S. corporate equity is owned by less than 5% of the households. But the capital gains of the past year have been so large that they should encourage healthy growth of demand for upmarket consumer goods as well as stronger retail spending in states with large concentrations of retired people, such as Florida. In 1992, households over the age of 65 owned 41.4% of publicly traded U.S. corporate equity despite the fact that they account for only 21.8% of all households. Households in the 45-54 year range, by contrast, own 18.07% of all U.S. equity and account for 16.42% of the population. It is popular in the investment community to describe senior citizens as people living on fixed incomes, but the spectacular performance of the stock market compared to real wages during recent years suggests that this label is misapplied. In the 1990's, it is people in their 20's and 30's, not the elderly, who are living on fixed incomes.  

<P>

  <B>If the rebound in the economy this spring does not push the purchasing agent index for inflation and other sensitive measures of industrial prices sharply higher, the Federal Reserve will probably permit short-term interest rates to remain at current levels through the summer and autumn.</B> It might decide to tighten in late 1996 if stronger growth in the world economy threatens to give a significant boost to commodity prices but the recovery in Europe and Japan is so weak that it will probably not generate major pressure on commodity prices until 1997. In contrast to U.S. industry, the European corporate sector has not yet reduced inventories significantly while final sales remain weak. Japan enjoyed healthy growth of final sales during the final quarter of 1995, but inventory levels are high and the government has not yet completed enactment of a rescue program for the banks. Large tax hikes are also scheduled for 1997. It should be noted as well that the bank rescue program now before the Japanese Diet is focused solely on the 8 trillion yen of bad debt in the Jusen. There are numerous other non-bank financial intermediaries with problem loans approaching 40 trillion yen.
