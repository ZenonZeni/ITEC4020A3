<B>Biomass to Hydrogen via Fast Pyrolysis and Reforming;<br>

Esteban Chornet, Principal Investigator,<br><a

Energy Laboratory</B></a>

<P>

Renewable-biomass-derived hydrogen is an attractive alternative

to petroleum- and natural-gas-derived hydrogen because it can

help us conserve our fossil resources.  Renewable biomass includes

wood, forestry and agricultural residues, diversified solid wastes,

and dedicated, high-production, regional energy-crop plantations.

The challenge is to produce hydrogen at a cost similar to that

of hydrocarbon-based processes.  Fast pyrolysis is a process that

converts biomass into a mixture of low-molecular-weight oxygenates

with typical yields of 60-65 wt% of dry biomass.  These oxygenates

are used as feedstock to a steam reforming operation to generate

hydrogen, which is separated from the CO<sub>2</sub> using commercially 
available

technology.  The key focus of this project is the catalytic steam

reforming step.

<P>

We conducted catalytic screening using model compounds and monitored

the product gas with a molecular beam mass spectrometer.  Results

indicate that Ni-based alumina preparations can reform the different

model compounds characteristic of the pyrolysis oils.  A 
continuous-flow,

tubular reactor was constructed to carry out time-on-stream studies

of different commercial catalysts as well as some improved 
non-commercial

catalyst formulations.

<P>

A technoeconomic analysis of our biomass-to-hydrogen process shows

that the production costs of hydrogen can be profitable in today's

hydrogen market in niches where hydrogen sells for at least $1.10

per kilogram.

<P>

<b><I>Recent Advances</I></b>:

<P>

Bench-scale experiments in a fixed-bed reformer using whole pyrolysis

oil suggest that the key to successful reforming lies in the feeding

system.  In order to minimize char formation, adequate feed atomization

and controlled temperature ramping are necessary.  We are designing

a mixer/nozzle injector to provide this control.

<P>

Even with this control, however, we expect to observe char or

carbon formation on the catalyst, much the same as in commercial

naphtha reforming operations.  Because of these carbon deposits,

the catalyst becomes deactivated over time and periodic regeneration

of the catalyst is needed.  We have found that by-product carbon

dioxide is as effective as air in regenerating the catalyst.  In

addition, the product gas from the regeneration step is enriched

in CO, and because the CO reacts with steam in the water-gas shift

reaction to produce hydrogen, regeneration with CO<sub>2</sub> has the 
added

effect of increasing the overall hydrogen yield.
