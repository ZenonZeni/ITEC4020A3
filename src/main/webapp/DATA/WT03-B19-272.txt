Ararat is committed to attracting new business ventures to the
region, and to assisting established businesses to flourish and
grow.

Ararat is at the junction of the Western Highway and the Pyrenees/Portland
Highways, linking Ararat to Melbourne, Geelong and Portland. 
All three of these major industrial centres are only two hours' drive
from Ararat.  The Western Highway also gives Ararat easy access
to the considerable Adelaide market.
<P>
The region is on the main Melbourne-Adelaide rail line, and at
the junction of the rail lines to Geelong and Portland, giving
it rail access to all ports and other Australian states.
<P>
Ararat, with an urban population of 10,000, is an attractive and
spacious town nestled in a natural amphitheatre among mountain
ranges. The majestic Grampians Range is nearby, as are the water
resorts of Lake Bolac, Lake Fyans and Green Hill Lake. The region
enjoys a temperate climate with warm summers, mild winters and
few frosts.
<H2>Living and working made easy</H2>

<P>
Living and working in Ararat and District is made easy with a
wide variety of excellent health and community services. These
include the 62-bed Ararat and District Hospital and associated
institutional aged care, retirement hostel and cottage-type accommodation.
<P>
Housing costs in Ararat are 53 per cent below comparable metropolitan
properties. Ararat has begun developing a large tract of serviced
residential land, preserving existing environmental assets and
providing 200 house lots in an innovative residential development.
<P>
The city's educational facilities include pre-schools, two secondary
colleges and the Ararat TAFE. Ararat offers a great variety of
recreational activities including a 25-metre indoor heated swimming
pool, gliding, cycling, hang gliding, water skiing, yachting,
tennis, golf, bowls, basketball, fishing, football, croquet and
bushwalking.
<P>
Ararat boasts excellent cultural facilities like the Performing
Arts Centre, affiliated with the Victorian Association of Performing
Arts Centres, the Ararat Entertainment Centre and the Regional
Art Gallery.
<P>
The region is at the centre of Victoria's wool growing district,
and grains, wine and meat are among its other important primary
products. Originally a gold mining area, minerals exploration
is again under way.
<H2>Infrastructure supports industry</H2>

<P>
Ararat's water supply has recently been upgraded, and more storage
has been made available at Mt Cole. Plans are under way for an
additional reservoir to be built within the next ten years.
<P>
Forward planning has given the city a waste treatment plant to
cater for the anticipated population growth and industrial development
that will take place within the next fifteen years.
<P>
The region's commitment to industrial development is demonstrated
by the recent creation of three industrial estates.  One of these
is strategically situated within the city, close to the Western
Highway, adjacent to the Adelaide-Melbourne railway line.
<P>
Because of agriculture's significance to the region and the importance
of creating value-added industries that take advantage of agricultural
production, a further industrial estate, zoned offensive trade,
is being developed specifically for industries like wool.  The
Council is considering developing a rural industrial zone near
the city's sewerage farm to make use of the high quality recycled
water available there.
<P>
Ararat has zoned land around Lake Bolac for industrial purposes,
and is carrying out a study looking at the possibilities of rezoning
land for industry in other towns like Willaura.  The Shire has
set aside funds to develop this land.
<P>
The region specialises in light manufacturing and engineering,
and Ararat provides the locale and infrastructure for such companies
to prosper.
<P>
Some examples include Ararat Manufacturing Enterprises, which
began as a two-man operation producing vehicle communication and
signal distribution systems, and now employs nearly seventy people.
<P>
Ararat Weaving Pty Ltd is planning to establish a new enterprise
spinning ultra-fine wool, adding value to the region's wool growing
strengths.  AF Gason Pty Ltd, design and manufacturing engineers
and the manufacturer of Arrow wood heaters, is making evaporative
coolers and farm machinery for the Australian and export markets.
<H2>Opportunities</H2>
The expansion of Southcorp Winery at nearby Great Western will
provide new opportunities for spinoff industries such as viticulture,
light industry and transport.
<P>
The region also offers business opportunities in tourism.  It
is close to the Grampians National Park, and the Mt Cole/Buangor
State Park.  The historic J Ward, built in 1858, is a former institution
for the incarceration of the criminally insane, and attracts many
visitors.
<P>
Visitors can tour and taste wines from a number of vineyards and
world class wineries, including Seppelts, Bests, Montara and Mt
Langi Ghiran.
<P>
The region's lakes provide a perfect setting for water sports
and fishing.  Greenhill Lake is only three kilometres from the
city centre, and is one of the best brown trout fishing reserves
in Victoria.
