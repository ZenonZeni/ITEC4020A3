<B> (WASHINGTON)</b></FONT><font size=3><b> -- The Commerce Department today imposed a $200,000 civil penalty on Yuchai America Corporation, of Cleveland, Ohio for alleged violations of the Export Administration Act and Regulations, John Despres, assistant secretary for Export Enforcement, announced today.  Yuchai America is an affiliate of Yuchai Machinery Company, Ltd. of China.<P>

The Department alleged that in May, 1994, Yuchai America attempted to export two five-axis milling machines to China without the required validated U.S. export license.  In addition, the Department alleged that the company made false and misleading statements of material fact on export control documents.  Although these machines were used equipment, they exceeded the technology limits permitted to be exported to China without a validated license. <P>

"Exporters of milling machines, even if they are used, may not ignore and violate export control laws," Despres said.  "Certain technologically sophisticated machines -- regardless of their age -- remain subject to export controls for national security reasons because they can be used to make parts for weapons systems." <P>

While neither admitting nor denying the violations, Yuchai America agreed to pay the civil penalty. <P>

The case is a result of an investigation by the New York Field Office of the Department of Commerce's Office of Export Enforcement.  The Department of Commerce controls and licenses the export and re-export of dual-use commodities and technical data.  Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration maintains and enforces these controls for reasons of national security, foreign policy, nonproliferation and short supply. <P>
