<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Living a Long Life -Alternative Medicine Can Show You How</CENTER></H2>

I think about longevity every day. At 69, of course I'm interested in living a longer
life and reversing the effects of aging....living a longer life and reversing the
effects of aging.terested in living a longer life and reversing the effects of
aging.ng. So are many of the physicians I work with who are about my age, not to
mention many millions of men and women now in their &quot;senior&quot; years. Just because you
reach your late 60s or 70s and become a &quot;senior citizen,&quot; why should this mean you
have to start living in a body that doesn't work well anymore? 

<P>That's not my vision of &quot;old age&quot; nor does it have to be yours. Alternative
medicine
can show you how to live a long life. In this issue our special focus on longevity
will fill you in on someeu in on someome of the long-life secrets we've found. 

<P>One of these secrets is Dr. Hazel Parcells, who graces the cover of this
<I>Digest.</I> At
105 years old, Dr. Parcells is the best living proof that if you follow the advice of
alternative medi advice of alternative mediedicine, you stand a very good chance of
extending your life and improving the way each minute of it feels. Dr. Parcells says
that one key to living better is to rid your body and foods of all toxins and
pollutants. Keep the vital energy of foods intactintact so this energy can keep your
body vital and healthy. Read our cover story, and find out her practical longevity
secrets, and start put them to work in your own life.

<P>You'll find another side of the longevity story in our articles on hormones.
Modern
science is showing that one of the main physiological events of aging is a marked
decline in many important hormones. 

<P>Teenagers overflow with hormones, yet in the decades after about age 40, the
body's
supply of key hormones such as melatonin, DHEA, estrogen, testtA, estrogen, testin
the decades after about age 40, your body's supply of key hormones such as melatonin,
DHEA, estrogen, testosterone, and human growth hormone, starts to drop. When it does,
body functions start to decline and aging begins. 

<P>While it seems we can't stop this natural, preprogrammed decline in body hormones,
perhaps we can shore up our dwindling supplies later in life. This is the idea
behind hormone replacement therapy. <I>The New York Times</I> recently underscored
this new
development  in a major health story: &quot;Restoring ebbing hormones may slow aging [as]
researchers hope supplements may have rejuvenating effects.&quot; Find out what hormone
replacement therapy is all about in the incisive article by Elmer Cranton, M.D., and
James Frackelton, M.D., experts in the field.
<A NAME="TEST"> </A>
<P>Here is one way to know you're getting low in essential hormones. Are you only 50
but
feel as if you're 70? In case things aren't that vivid, there is a simple saliva
test you can take to see where your hormone levels are. You spit some saliva into a
tube and send it back to a lab; they tell you how you're doing with progesterone,
testosterone, an and estrogen. If you're a physician, you can assess levels of 7
hormones. As Aeron Lifecycles president John M. Kells notes, &quot;This is a convenient,
noninvasive, and private way to assess the effectiveness in health choices relative
to hormonal balance. An iindividual can therefore monitor hormonal change at
different times of the month or as an assessment associated with age.&quot; 
<A NAME="skin"> </A>
<P>Here's another long-life self-help tip for you. Let's say your test results come
back
showing a deficit in several hormones. College Pharmacy in Colorado Springs will
formulate a hormone supplement designed to meet your exact needs, or supply you with
natural formulations of hormones such as progesterone and DHEA. Under the dire the
diremacist Tom Bader, R.ph, they've been doing this foction of pharmacist Tom Bader,
R.ph., they've been doing this for a nationwide clientele since 1985. What is
different about their approach, however, is that the hormones are delivered through
the skin with a gel,
not by injections, patches, or orally. &quot;Our idea is to get a natural substance into
the bloodstream at a physiologically compatible rate,&quot; says Bader. &quot;You apply the gel
once a day to your skin, then with every passing minute, it slowly drips into your
bloodstream from the skin reservoir, helping to balance out your system."

<P>These are just two examples of how alternative medicine is coming up with
practical,
nontoxic, and affordable answers to the perennial question of aging. If you
want
to
take steps to insure that you will live longer, look to alternative medicine.
<A NAME="defec"> </A>
<P>Meanwhile, everything we've been saying for years-that environmental pollutants
produce degenerative disease-is being dreadfully proven in Russia. There, according
to a new report published August 1, 1995, the average male life expectancy has
plummeted from 64 to 57 in only four years while infant mortality has soared by 15%
in just 2 years. Cases of birth defects are increasing faster than any other health
problem and 50% of all
children suffer from chronic illness. Epidemic rates of cancer and heart disease
account for most of the premature deaths of men.

<P>Russian scientists are now looking to their country's chronic ecological abuse for
answers. They're finding that decades of unregulated chemical, industrial,
agricultural, and nuclear pollution are killing their population. Let's keep this
from being our future, too. If we want longevity we must clean up our environment.

<P>Don't forget that medicine has a political dimension. We all have to work hard to
insure that we have the right
<I>right to choose</I> what kind of therapy we want.
Political initiatives afoot this year are of paramount importance to the future of
alternative medicine in America. Read the up-to-the-minute reports in our department,
<I>The Politics of Medicine.</I> Remember, not only do we want a long and healthy
life, 
but
we want a long life for the practice of alternative medicine in this country where
real freedom of ma long life, but we want a long life for the practice of alternative
medicine in this country where real freedom of medical choice is not a given, not
yet. With your help we can change that.
