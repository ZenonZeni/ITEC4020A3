 <i>An underactive thyroid gland may be the reason your chronic health problems aren't getting any better.</i><p>
 <tt>BY STEPHEN E. LANGER, M.D.</tt><p>
</center>

<br>

There's a hidden reason why weight problems, muscle pain, chronic fatigue, depression, and other conditions don't respond to treatment. It's called the thyroid gland. Located in the neck, it's the largest of the body's 9 endocrine glands, and its role in all aspects of healthy body functioning is paramount. Yet it is also probably the most overlooked factor in a great many health problems, from chronic fatigue to obesity, depression to skin problems.<p> 
In fact, in the 1940s, Broda O. Barnes, M.D., Ph.D., a pioneer in thyroid research and the author of 100 medical articles on this gland, made a remarkable statement that is still not sufficiently heeded today. Dr. Barnes said that untreated problems with the thyroid gland represent the underlying condition responsible for 64 common medical ailments suffered by about 40% of the population. With the increasing prevalance of chronic and degenerative illness today, perhaps it is time to pay more attention to Dr. Barnes' conclusions.<p>
Since I began medical practice in 1967, probably the single most important element in my approach has been attention to the thyroid gland and 2 hormones it secretes. The thyroid controls how fast energy is burned in every cell, a process called metabolic activity. The healthy functioning of the thyroid is central to everything else in the body and, as Dr. Barnes said, problems here can contribute to numerous medical conditions.<p> 
Yet the "cure" is surprisingly simple: nothing has so low a toxicity level and is as easy and inexpensive to use as thyroid hormone, correctly administered by a physician. There is much more room for therapeutic intervention with thyroid-based health conditions than with other glandular problems because, while the thyroid is central to so many body functions, hormonal adjustments can be made with minimal disturbance of the overall system.<p>

<br><b>THE WHOLE BODY BECOMES UNDERACTIVE</b><p>
The list of thyroid-related health problems is long and disturbing. It includes many chronic fatigue cases, the inability to lose weight, anemia unrelieved by iron supplementation, feeling cold in the extremities even in warm climates, lethargy, concentration and memory problems, mental sluggishness, depression, skin problems (eczema, dry, scaly, or coarse skin, acne), swelling and fluid retention, constipation, hair loss, menstruation problems (especially heavy bleeding), extreme sleepiness, slowed heart rate, diminished sexual interest and ability, chronic muscle pain and weakness, and a higher susceptibility to infectious diseases.<p>
When the thyroid is underactive, everything in the body gradually becomes hypoactive as well, from circulation to libido. But here's the problem: It's my estimation that a large number of clinically severe thyroid conditions go undetected for long periods of time and some, regrettably, are never picked up. <p>
Along with this, people are often erroneously treated for chronic health conditions that are really based on the thyroid and that would respond well and quickly to a small dose of thyroid hormone. <p>
For example, take skin problems. One of the first things the body does when the thyroid is underactive is reduce the blood supply to the skin to conserve energy. As a result, such a person will perspire less, bacteria can flourish on the skin, and acne lesions can develop. If you aggressively treat the acne and ignore the thyroid, you won't see much permanent change.<p>
As another example, consider depression. I treated a patient who had been depressed for 60 years; yet when he took thyroid hormone, his depression was gone within a month. Whatever his previous physicians prescribed focused on his depression but missed the underlying thyroid cause, so he was miserable for most of his lifetime. <p>
Incidentally, although medical research and statistics suggest that an underactive thyroid is more common in women, I contend there is as much underactive thyroid and thyroiditis (inflamed thyroid) in men as in women.<p>

<br><b>REVERSING 10 YEARS OF HYPOTHYROIDISM</b><p>
When Frank, aged 47, first walked into my office, he had near total body failure and was almost permanently bedridden. He had chronic fatigue, intermittent headaches, light sensitivity, multiple chemical sensitivities, heart palpitations, mood swings, and anxiety fluctuating with depression. Frank was cold all the time, his appetite was poor, his mental abilities were sluggish, and he'd been sick for most of the previous 10 years. He was on prescription antidepressants.<p>
I ordered standard laboratory tests for Frank's thyroid function, to evaluate the status of T3, T4, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), and FTI (free thyroxine index, to see how much thyroxine was actually active). Some physicians only look at T4 levels. Taken alone, this is useless. TSH is the most sensitive indicator of thyroid function. The whole thyroid panel should be run. Of the 4, Frank's TSH levels were highly elevated; the normal range is 0.35 to 5.5, but his was 10.6. Any elevation of TSH means the thyroid gland is failing functionally. <p>
Frank started taking a quarter of a grain daily of natural thyroid hormone derived from animals. Over the next 3 months, I gradually increased the dosage to almost 2 grains per day. My preference was to run a series of allergy sensitivity tests but Frank's budget didn't allow for this. As a way of working around this, he began a low-fat diet that was high in complex carbohydrates and low in "glycemic" foods, which means foods whose carbohydrate (or simple sugar) composition is absorbed too rapidly into the bloodstream. <p>
Frank tracked his diet to see which foods provoked problems, and identified wheat, corn, and dairy as allergenic foods to be eliminated. He took a high-potency multiple mineral/vitamin supplement and about 1000 mg total of the essential fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6. These were in the form of gamma linolenic acid (GLA) from borage oil (240 mg, twice daily) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 240 mg, twice daily). <p>
Frank also took daily doses of Ester C, a form of vitamin C (500 mg), calcium (125 mg), and magnesium (65 mg). I also increased his dietary protein intake so that more amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) would be available to his brain where they could help offset the biochemical side of his depression.<p>
Over the 3 months on the thyroid hormone, Frank's condition steadily improved. Stamina, energy, digestion, muscular function, mood—everything got better. All of his systems had been operating at suboptimal levels; restoring the correct level of thyroid hormone was like stoking the flames in all his cells. <p>
Frank was a classic "basket case" before taking the thyroid hormone, but now he is a functional human being, doing a world better than he was before. He's able to fend for himself, prepare his own meals, and exercise regularly without being drugged to the eyeballs on conventional medications which gave him practically every side effect possible. In fact, Frank's mental processes improved so much with the thyroid hormone, that he was able to stop taking all his prescription drugs. <p>


<br><b>ENDING 3 YEARS OF PAINFUL THYROIDITIS</b><p>
A second major health problem relating to an underactive thyroid is called Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroid-itis, known as HAIT or, simply, thyroiditis. Here the thyroid gland is enlarged, usually without pain. However, the autoimmune factor is involved because the body releases antibodies against its own thyroid as if it were a foreign object in the body. HAIT seems to run in families, with most patients being between the ages of 13 and 40.<p>
Typical symptoms include fatigue, memory loss, depression, and a sense of nervousness that can range from mild anxiety to serious panic attack. You can also have allergies, irregular heartbeat or palpitations, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances in which you wake up with your mind racing and heart beating fast, reduced sexual interest, menstrual irregularities, headaches, digestive disorders, and intestinal problems from diarrhea to constipation. Also, you are likely to have the sensation of a lump in your throat; this is actually your inflamed, slightly swollen thyroid gland.<p>
When I am confronted with this symptom picture, I routinely have the patient's thyroid antibodies checked. For example, a person's thyroid hormone levels (such as T4) may be normal but their thyroid antibodies are elevated. Many physicians miss this; in my opinion, thyroid antibody tests should be run routinely on anyone with a chronic health problem. If a patient has a low elevation of thyroid antibodies, I will start this person on a low dose of thyroid hormone even if their thyroid hormone levels are supposedly normal. Let me explain this by presenting a case.<p>
Theodora, aged 43, came to me with multiple symptoms. She had chronic joint and muscle pain and fatigue, numerous infections, frequent sore throats, and was always on the verge of having a cold. She had intermittent heart palpitations, irregular periods, intestinal gas, indigestion, constipation, and diarrhea. She had pain in seemingly every muscle in her body, plus headaches, insomnia, and nasal congestion. While her thyroid hormone levels were normal, her level of thyroid antibodies was sky-high.<p>
I started her on a low dose of thyroid hormone, at a quarter of a grain per day, then gradually increased this to 3 grains over the next year. A lab test indicated she was deficient in 3 amino acids, vitamin B5, inositol, and zinc. Rather than prescribing amino acid supplements, I had her increase her dietary protein intake. To address the other deficiencies., I started Theodora on a high-potency multiple vitamin/mineral.  <p>
People with thyroid problems tend to have sluggish intestines. Another test indicated that Theodora had an elevated Candida albicans yeast infection in her intestines. To address this, Theodora started a high complex carbohydrate diet and avoided refined sugars, sweets, and fruits; she began rotating her foods so that her system was not constantly having to process the same foods. Through food allergy testing, I determined that Theodora was sensitive to a long list of foods, including kidney beans, rye grain, cheddar cheese, egg yolk, wheat, almonds, figs, kale, and others.<p>
I also gave her grapefruit seed extract (500 mg, 3 times daily) to help detoxify her intestines; Acidophilus capsules (2 capsules, 3 times daily) to recolonize her intestines with the appropriate "friendly" bacteria;  Aquaflora, a homeopathic remedy for yeast infections (taken once daily for 30 days); and high-potency garlic (1 tablet, twice daily).<p>
After about 6 months on this program, many of Theodora's symptoms were much reduced, and after a total of 12 months, she was about 75% improved. Her muscle pains were greatly diminished, her energy level was much better, all signs of flu and cold were gone, she was able to exercise comfortably, and all her digestive processes were practically normal.  <p>
My HAIT patients often ask me if they must remain on thyroid hormone indefinitely. I have been able to wean many of my HAIT patients from a thyroid supplement in a relatively short time—within 3-6 months—by bolstering their immune system nutritionally. <p>
