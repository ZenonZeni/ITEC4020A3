<P>
The CRC for Hardwood and Paper Science was formed in 1992 as a co-operative effort between three research institutions and the Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia.
It aims to harness the best scientific and technical expertise to build up the internationally competitive position of the Australian pulp and paper industry and to create new commercial opportunities.
Research focuses on the rapid and effective characterisation of pulpwood quality and the paper-making potential of plantation hardwoods.
<P>
<H3>R&D strengths</H3>
The CRC maintains a fundamental research program within the framework of strong industrial and commercial input. Novel measurement techniques are released early for evaluation by Australian industry.
Projects include research into ways of manipulating, and measuring fibre and wood properties, developing models for future wood supply and determining more precisely the interactive effect of processing on wood, fibre and paper.
<P>
<H3>Successes</H3>
Key results have been obtained in the following areas:
<UL>
<LI>Developing tree-sampling strategies for measuring techniques.
<LI>Cambial dynamics and the role of hormones in fibre development.
<LI>Progress towards developing an automatic method for analysing microfibil angles in increment cores.
<LI>Pulping kinetic models.
<LI>Confocal microscopy and micro-raman spectroscopy.
<LI>Techniques for measuring surface properties.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Commercial significance of work</H3>
The pulp and paper industry in Australia has sales in excess of $2.7 billion a year. The CRC aims to support the development of sustainable resources of high quality by concentrating its research effort on the quality of the paper-making fibre. Improving both the fibre quality and yield in the production process will have enormous economic benefit for the industry, enhancing its international competitiveness.
<P>
<H3>Why Victoria?</H3>
Victoria has a long history of pulp and paper manufacturing and continues to play a prominent role in the expansion of the industry.
 Victoria plays the most significant part in developing new technologies and strategies for the Australian industry. Most of the major resource centres are based in Victoria.
<P>
<H3>Training and education</H3>
The Australian Pulp and Paper Institute at Monash University offers a Masters course directed at the pulp and paper industry. In addition the CRC has run briefing sessions for the industry.
<P>
<H3>Participants</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Monash University, Australian Pulp and Paper Institute
<LI>Melbourne University, School of Forestry, Creswick
<LI>CSIRO Division of Forest Products
<LI>Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Business opportunities</H3>
The work being undertaken will ensure the continuing expansion of the pulp and paper industry in Australia. The flow-on to Australian suppliers to the industry will be significant.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>
Funding is provided by the CRC partners and through the direct grant from the Australian Government CRC Policy Program. Total funding over seven years will amount to $24 million.
