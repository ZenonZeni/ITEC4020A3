1995 YEAR-END BROADBAND NETWORKING REVIEW

     Upon reviewing the developments in the 1995 broadband networking
market, the differences in terms of market acceptance and technical
development of each broadband technology -- frame relay, switched
multimegabit data service (SMDS), and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
-- are dramatic.  Each networking solution occupies a different
position on the acceptance curve, and carriers and vendors pursued
numerous strategies in 1995 to spur the adoption of the technologies.
     It is not news to BROADBAND NETWORKING NEWS' readers that frame
relay had an incredibly successful 1995.  Carriers increased the
robustness of their networks to meet clamoring demand, pursued a
variety of pricing strategies designed to capture greater market
shares, and offered enhanced frame relay services to satisfy more
sophisticated users.  All three measures reflect the technology's
maturity and mass market acceptance as a wide area networking
solution.

  ...Frame Relay Pricing Approaches

     AT&T, Sprint Corp., and MCI Communications Corp. all unveiled new
frame relay pricing strategies in 1995.  AT&T -- hoping to leverage
what it saw as a trend toward meshed networks and encourage users to
add more network sites -- lowered the price of permanent virtual cir-
cuits (PVCs) by 65 percent to 85 percent and raised its frame relay
port charges by 35 percent to 45 percent (See BNN, April 18, 1995).  
     Sprint pursued a different pricing tactic to attract customers,
offering a very low-cost, zero committed information rate (CIR)
service for users needing no more than four PVCs (See BNN, June 27,
1995).  
     MCI took yet a third track.  The carrier eliminated the mileage
bands that had been associated with its service and offered usage-
based billing, which should prove attractive to low-usage customers
(See BNN, Oct. 3, 1995).  Expect more pricing changes in 1996 as
carriers continue to seek new methods for luring customers to their 
networks and as the FCC has required that all facilities-based
carriers file frame relay tariffs.
     Carriers also increased the robustness of their frame relay
services. In 1995, LDDS Worldcom was the most aggressive of the long
distance carriers at pursing network-to-network interface (NNI) agree-
ments with local and international providers.  Worldcom offers NNI
service in 31 domestic cities via interconnections with all of the
regional holding companies and other local carriers.  Some
international agreements are also in place.  The links allow Worldcom
to extend its network reach and to provide customers with lower cost
local access.
     AT&T unveiled a strong suite of frame relay disaster recovery
options, while Sprint launched a managed frame relay access device
(FRAD) service for Systems Network Architecture (SNA) users.  MCI
sought to expand customer access to its frame relay network by
offering a wide array of remote access options.  (See BNN, Nov. 28,
1995; Oct. 3, 1995; and Nov. 14, 1995)

  ...ATM Infrastructure Buildout

     In the wide area ATM arena, carriers continued building their
initial infrastructures in preparation for expected customer demand. 
LDDS Worldcom, Sprint, Ameritech Corp., GTE Corp., and MFS Datanet
were among those that upgraded their ATM networks in 1995.  ATM also
proved to be a successful carrier backbone solution for transporting
frame relay traffic.
     Although few customers actually are buying native ATM services,
carriers experimented with new service offerings designed to make ATM
easier to use and to tempt customers to test the service.  Sprint
launched low-speed T-1 ATM as well as a frame relay-to-ATM service
interworking offering.  Both services provide a migration strategy for
frame relay users that may need additional capacity in their congested
sites and also offer users a lower-cost option for experimenting with
ATM.  Other carriers are expected to launch similar services.
     Worldcom became the first carrier to offer available bit rate
(ABR) ATM based on StrataCom's early implementation of ABR
capabilities on its BPX switch.  As the ATM Forum's traffic management
specifications solidify in 1996, expect additional vendors and
carriers to roll out products and services based on the much
anticipated ABR spec.
     MFS Datanet took a unique approach to running voice traffic over
its ATM backbone.  Although MFS Datanet's WAVE offering is based on a
proprietary solution that utilizes Nortel's Magellan Passport ATM
switch, the service demonstrates MFS' ability to develop easy-to-use
ATM solutions.  Customers don't have to change their networks, but can
continue using their existing PBX systems and data networking
equipment to transport data and voice traffic over variable bit rate
(VBR) ATM (See BNN, Sept. 5, 1995).
     This ability to make ATM transparent to users will be critical
for attracting customers to the service.  Carriers and vendors that do
this well will have an advantage in 1996, and recognition of this fact
is demonstrated by the surge of interest that developed in the second
half of 1995 for wide area ATM access products. Several vendors
including ADC Kentrox, OnStream Networks, and Premisys  began shipping
or unveiled plans to produce wide area ATM access products.  This
trend is sure to continue in 1996.

  ...Offering End-to-End Solutions

    Another key trend that evolved throughout 1995 in the ATM arena
was the importance of offering customers end-to-end solutions that
encompass both local and wide area networks.  Some vendors, Newbridge
Networks for example, concentrated on developing their own products
that span both the LAN and WAN, while others like FORE Systems and
Nortel pursued partnerships that involved joint product development as
well as co-marketing.  Acquisitions and partnerships are likely to
continue in 1996.  Smaller firms likely will attempt to increase their
market presence by merging with each other, and large companies will
gobble up startups with unique and innovative products.

  ...SMDS, The Sleeper Service

    Although SMDS is not expected to achieve frame relay's popularity,
several developments in 1995 will help spur additional sales.  Many
local carriers rolled out low-speed SMDS, which should prove popular
with firms wanting to add remote sites to the corporate network.  
    The growth of image intensive applications in the printing and
medical communities is expected to continue in 1996, and SMDS has
proven popular in these industries.  Pricing changes by MCI, which
eliminated the service's usage minimums, also should lower the
barriers to entry for companies wanting to move to the new service.  
    The Internet proved a boon to all three broadband technologies in
1995, as companies bought circuits from carriers for access and
vendors sold products to build high-speed Internet backbones.  As
local telcos continue their move into the Internet access business in
1996, vendors and carriers with products and services that perform
well in the Internet environment are expected to prosper.

RACAL GETS BARGAIN BRITISH NETWORK

     Racal Electronics has beaten four or five other would-be buyers
on the Department of Transport's shortlist with a successful bid to
acquire BR Telecommunications (BRT) from the British Railways Board. 
Racal will pay Pounds 132.75 million ($204.5 million) to acquire BRT.
    BRT's business principally consists of providing
telecommunications services to Railtrack and the railway operating
companies.  With some 6,900 miles of trunk cable and 10,000 miles of
branch cables, BRT is the largest telecommunications infrastructure
network operator in the U.K. other than British Telecom, Mercury, and
military establishments. 
    The BRT network provides voice, data, and radio network services;
private circuits; and a range of customer premise equipment.  The
company employs around 2,800 people based at some 180 locations
throughout the U.K.  The business is divided into four operating
sections: 
    *  Networks. Provides and manages fixed and mobile
telecommunications network services.
    *  Carrier Services. Provides dark fiber, management of tele-
communications wayleaves, and management of pay phones and other
property-based assets.
    *  Maintenance. Provides maintenance of equipment and
telecommunications and electronic systems.
    *  Projects and Works. Comprises a project engineering and
installation service for the supply of telecommunications networks,
systems, and equipment.

  ...Competitive Position Strengthened

    BRT will become a separate subsidiary within the Racal Network
Services
group, managed on a fully integrated basis with the other businesses. 
The acquisition is expected to strengthen Racal's competitive position
to provide managed network services and to enhance the prospects for
the Racal Group as a whole.  BRT's fiber-based network will provide
access to extensive telecommunications circuits and telecommunications
wayleaves over Railtrack and British Railways Board property.  The
integration of BRT with other Racal Network Services businesses will
result in cost savings through improved utilization of BRT capacity,
sharing of assets, and avoiding duplication of functions within the
enlarged group.
    Ownership of the BRT network and its capabilities will enhance the
prospect of securing substantial and strategically important
commercial and government contracts.  Racal's existing work force will
be strengthened through the addition of the skilled engineering and
national maintenance staff employed by BRT.
    Commenting on the acquisition, Racal Chairman Sir Ernest Harrison
said, "There is considerable growth potential for BRT in both the rail
community and other related markets within the fast-moving managed
telecommunications sector, where Racal has an outstanding record... 
As the turnkey contractor responsible for the installation and
maintenance of the entire voice and data communications infrastructure
for the Channel tunnel, Racal has particular expertise in the rail
environment, and we believe that the acquisition of BRT will bring
substantial benefits to both parties."
    Racal won the contract to establish the Government Data Network --
which remains one of Europe's largest private data network -- in 1989,
and also manages the communications requirements of a growing number
of major companies. Despite losing out to Mercury to provide managed
communications services for the police and for NatWest Bank, Racal
gained a full telecom license in 1994, and has in excess of 300,000
customers for its voice, data, and messaging services.
    Because BRT is a member (with a 7.7 percent share) of the
pan-European rail communications consortium, which is building an
optical network, there will be opportunities for Racal to expand into
continental Europe as well.  (Contact: Racal, +44 1734 66 99 69)

SPECIFICATION WORK CONTINUES, ATM FORUM CONTEMPLATES GOALS FOR 1996

     With an eye toward sending its work out for final vote at the
February meeting, the traffic management, signaling, and private
network-to-network interface working groups of the ATM Forum addressed
the initial round of straw vote comments received regarding their
respective specifications.  Work on all three documents is progressing
in tandem so that the provisions in each will align.
    George Dobrowski, chairman of the technical committee and director
of broadband switching and signaling for Bell Communications Research,
reported that group members clarified various points in all three
specs.  Regarding the provisions for allowed cell rate, members
decided that ATM switches, rather than network interface cards, would
be responsible for governing allowed cell rates. 
    "By putting the function in the switch, it allows us to eliminate
two quality of service (QOS) parameters, so it simplifies the traffic
management and signaling procedures.  It also reduces the cost of
implementation in the network interface cards," Dobrowski said.  He
added that switches can better bear those implementation costs because
they are spread over more users.

  ...International Interoperability Addressed

    The groups determined that support for the internationally defined
QOS classes (i.e. A,B,C,D) is mandatory, whereas the parameter
approach defined by the ATM Forum will be optional.  However, as
Dobrowski explained, "If you do specify [the parameters] and the
device is able to understand them, then the parameter approach will
take precedence over QOS classes because it gives you more precision." 
He added that the QOS class approach is the only one included in the
international standards and that vendors wanting to sell equipment in
Europe need to use an internationally recognized standard.  "This
addresses the interoperability concerns that people had between
equipment based on ITU standards versus ATM Forum implementations,"
Dobrowski said.
    In the signaling arena, the group solidified negotiation
procedures.  "With the previous release of the signaling spec, if the
connection point couldn't accept your request, you had to start the
connection all over again," Dobrowski explained.  "Now, some
negotiation will be possible.  Users can access or reject or adjust
downward their initial request and go forward with it."   The result
is faster connections, as users won't need to resend certain signaling
messages if network capacity is not available to meet their bandwidth
requirements.
    Other specs out for final ballot include the DS-3 direct mapping
physical layer interface, an addendum to the 155 unshielded twisted
pair (UTP) physical layer interface, the native ATM services semantic
description (or ATM application programming interface), the Protocol
Implementation Conformance Statement (PIC) for UTP 3, and the
conformance abstract test suite for AAL type 5.  A clarifying LAN
emulation addendum also was released.

  ...Reevaluation Underway

    As work nears completion on many critical issues before the ATM
Forum, members are closely examining the role the body will take in
the future.  "We are going through a strategic planning process,
identifying potential work areas or what holes exist in providing end-
to-end ATM connections.  We will go through a debate and voting
process to pick out high priority items," Dobrowski said.  He said
that so far the group has identified 21 potential work areas, and that
in April the technical committee will restructure its working groups
and make new assignments.  Although he wouldn't commit the committee
to any specific areas, Dobrowski noted that, "The item which received
the most attention at the last meeting was wireless ATM.  It's still
early to say, but that seemed to have very broad support and...that is
a candidate for new work."

BT SETS NEW SPEED RECORD FOR FIBER.  

    Scientists and engineers at BT Laboratories, Martlesham, have used
photonic technology to shatter world speed records for broadband
superhighways.  They have designed a new type of telecommunications
network, based entirely on the transmission of laser beams through
optical fiber, using devices that almost completely can eliminate
conventional electronic circuits.
    Key elements for this "supernet of the 21st century" are new
photonic components invented and built at Martlesham.  These include
an optical transistor, which BT claims is capable of processing
information at 80 Gbps, and a high-speed optical switch many times
smaller than existing designs.
    These are the basic building blocks used to construct an
all-optical telephone exchange that can read information from a packet
of data at a rate of 100 Gbps, decode the identity of the intended
recipient, and switch the packet onto its destination path.  BT
anticipates bringing this technology out of the lab during 1996, and
building a working prototype photonic network.  The prototype network
will use the existing optical fiber linking six towns in South East
England to allow the new devices to be tested in real working
conditions.  (Contact: BT Labs, +44 1473 647 448)

ASCOM BUILDS CAMBRIDGE ATM NETWORK.  

    Ascom Timeplex, in cooperation with Switzerland-based research
division Ascom Tech, has designed and built an ATM network for the
Language Center at the University of Cambridge.  The basic ring
operates at 1.25 Gbps across existing dark fiber.  It provides 25 Mbps
ATM to desktop PCs via a broadband solution that includes
transmission, switching, access, servers, and multimedia applications.
    The network, installed as part of a European Commission RACE
project called HIPERNET, is designed to facilitate language learning
through technology and involves equipment and support from IBM,
GEC-Marconi, VTT, AND Software, CAP SESA, and the University of
Cambridge.  While currently only serving seven PCs and a server,
located at five sites spanning a total path of about 15 kilometers,
the project eventually will address the problems of using ATM across a
campus extending 50 kilometers, and a user base of several hundred.

LAN SWITCHING HUB MARKET GROWING: GOOD NEWS FOR CARRIER ATM SALES

     According to a new report by The Insight Research Corp., "The LAN
to WAN Interface: LAN Switching Hubs and the Advance of ATM Networking
1995-2000," the growth in the LAN hub market is an indicator of the
future potential of ATM switch sales and of wide area ATM sales by
carriers.  Insight believes that the growing LAN switching hub market
is good news for the ATM industry because such hubs provide a
migration path to ATM, while still allowing companies to maximize the
use of their legacy systems. 
    "LAN switching hubs are the immediate solution and will provide an
easy migration to ATM switching platforms when their use becomes
widespread toward the end of the decade," said Robert Rosenberg,
president of Insight.
    The research firm predicts that shipments of LAN hubs in the
United States will grow from $4.6 billion in 1995 to $14.9 billion by
the year 2000.  Worldwide hub revenues are targeted to increase from
$6.2 billion to $19.7 billion in 2000 (see box).  In its report,
Insight outlines a variety of strategies that carriers can use to

  ...Technical Cooperation Encouraged 

    Carriers are encouraged to promote close alliances with switch
manufacturers and to freely exchange technical information with
vendors.  "If the switch manufacturer has access to the technical
details of the carrier's network operations, the switch manufacturer
can then design products which work well with the carrier's public
data service," writes Insight.  "The user would be assured of both the
network performance and the compatibility between the carrier's
network and the LAN switch."
    Insight also believes that using wide area ATM to support a LAN
interconnection service offers carriers significant opportunities for
growth.  It recommends that service providers:
    *  Strictly adhere to ATM standards.  Compliance will ensure that
procedures such as congestion control are uniform across both local
and long-distance networks and that interconnection is transparent to
users.
    *  Provide cost-effective ATM service pricing.  The cost of
deploying ATM needs to be justifiable initially for data traffic only.
    *  Use flexible connections.  Provide a simple tariff based on
port bandwidth capacity and avoid the complexities of frame relay
pricing.
    *  Provide competitive differentiation.  Value-added features and
industry-specific applications can help carriers distinguish their
services from pure ATM transport offerings.
