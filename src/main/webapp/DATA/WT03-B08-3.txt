UNITED STATES:  CLOSURE IS ONLY OPTION FOR MIAMI FIRM

Christmas has not brought warm tidings for Miami-based Mershon Sawyer
Johnston Dunwody & Cole. Following the collapse of merger talks with
Shutts & Bowen, one of Florida's best-known firms, the firm decided to
close its doors permanently at the end of 1995.

The 75-year-old practice, which had three offices in its home state as
well as an office in London, employed over 100 lawyers at its height
but this number has dwindled in recent years. At the time of the
announcement, it is estimated that there were about 50 lawyers employed
in the firm.

According to marketing director Angela Spall, the firm suffered from
involuntary downsizing in recent years from several rounds of
defections to rival firms including Shutts & Bowen. The defections may
have been the result of a lack of direction within the firm.

"It was a very democratic firm and it was hard for one group to manage
well." said Spall. "It was like herding cats. There was no strong
visionary leader and too many agendas."

The final blow

The final blow came in September when the entire trust and state
department, which was regarded as the firm's flagship, left to set up a
new firm, Dunwody White & Landen.

"After that, the firm did not have the right mix of practice group,"
Spall commented. Other key practice areas within the practice were
litigation, tax and health care.

Before winding up operations, Mershon Sawyer approached several firms
in the city about the possibility of a merger, including litigation
practice Tew & Beasely and Shutts & Bowen. It was the final blow when
the Shutts & Bowen talks broke down and management responded by voting
to dissolve. The chairman of the executive committee at Shutts & Bowen,
Bowman Brown, reported that a lawyer who had moved to Shutts & Bowen
from Mershon Sawyer approached the management committee concerning a
merger. The proposal was considered because Mershon Sawyer was a well
respected firm.

However, Bowman said that discussions never went beyond the
preliminaries. "We reviewed the situation with a consultant and decided
that we already provided the services that they provide and saw no
significant advantage in a merger," said Bowman.

Strong financial position

The perception in some quarters was that the talks fell through because
Mershon Sawyer had made too many demands. However, Spall noted that the
firm was negotiating from a strong financial position:"The firm's
problems were not financial. We were very stable financially and held
on to our institutional clients." Clients included Citibank, First
Union National Bank, Mercedez-Benz, Chrysler and Miami University.

The fate of the lawyers working in Mershon Sawyer's offices outside
Miami is secure. The London operations were acquired by another Miami-
based firm Steel Hector & Davis, and the 11-lawyer West Palm Beach
office was bought out by Orlando firm Akerman Senterfit. The Naples
office has opted to go on its own and the Key West office is a one-
person operation.

UNITED KINGDOM:  GRANT THORNTON SURVEY SHOWS LEVEL PROFITS

Profits at UK law firms have levelled in the last year with some firms
experiencing a reduction, according to Grant Thornton's 1995
Solicitors' Interfirm Comparison.

Firms in the five to nine-partner group emerged as the group that had
suffered most with the number of firms earning high profit margins and
profit levels declining. Overall average profits per partner was down
from #71,000 ($108,686) to #61,000 this year.

Profits per partner for larger firms with more than 20 partners also
declined from #100,000 to #92,000. The results, however, of the most
successful firms continued to improve with profits per partner
averaging #178,000. The most successful regions outside London were
Northern England and Scotland.

GERMAN FIRMS GRANTED LICENCES IN CHINA

German firms Beiten Burkhardt Mittl & Wegener and Schulz Noack
Barwinkel have been granted licences to operate in China. Their arrival
strengthens the German contingent in Beijing where Punder Volhard Weber
& Axster, among the first batch of foreign law firms to enter the
country, had been the sole representative for several years.

According to Juergen Burkhardt, who will be heading Beiten Burkhardt's
operations in Beijing, German industry is very aware of the
opportunities to be gleaned in China, an awareness which was further
heightened by Chancellor Kohl's recent visit.

Along with Burkhardt, there will be a Chinese-qualified lawyer and a
German-qualified lawyer on board. The office will mainly be involved
with negotiating joint ventures for German companies and has gained
some work through one of Germany's leading banks Bayerische-
Vereinsbank. The China venture will be complemented by a new Hong Kong
office which opened at the same time.

Strategically, Burkhardt sees the move as beneficial for his firm with
China's economy set to explode over the next few decades. "European
industry has to benefit from the low labour costs and huge markets."

But there is a learning curve. Burkhardt believes that the Chinese
Government has become more restrictive in an effort to channel
investment with the result that growth may be limited. "We will have to
be patient," he said."Chinese are not used to the accounting system,
they are not used to working in a strict and orderly fashion - we all
have to adjust."

Schulz Noack Barwinkel is a small Hamburg firm whose arrival shows that
interest in China is high among law firms of every size.

RUSSIA:  LAWYERS RESERVE JUDGMENT ON EFFECTS OF ELECTION

With communists and nationalists the main victors in Russia's
parliamentary elections, foreign investors are worried. But
international lawyers are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.

"The parliamentary elections are unlikely to have a substantial effect
on foreign investment," noted Jacky Baudon, managing partner at the
Moscow office of UK firm Freshfields. "The presidential elections in
June and the election of the regional governors over 1996 should be
more telling."

LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae's resident partner Brian Zimbler is
keeping a close eye on the situation: "We are continuing to see a large
flow of investment and we understand that there will be political ups
and downs. The results are the sign of the difficulties of conversion
to a market economy."

Glenn Faass of Canadian firm Macleod Dixon said it is unlikely that a
communist president will be elected in June, but if it should arise,
the situation would be more difficult. But how much more difficult is
not easy to determine. "It is not clear what the communists are
standing for," said Fass. "They seem to sell a message to the audience
that the audience wants to hear."

LeBoeuf's Zimbler recently attended a meeting with Gennady Zyuganov,
the head of the Communist Party, and found him to be conciliatory to
foreign investment: "So if you take him at his word, there should be
nothing to worry about."

This is good news, but Faass warned:"The next six months will be a
period of uncertainty, and foreign investors who do not have to spend
money will not. This may turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy,
because if foreign investors do not continue to show support for
reform, then the voters may look the other way."

EUROPE:  COURT RULES ON ESTABLISHMENT

With the European Commission about to report to the European Parliament
on the draft directive on the rights of establishment of lawyers, the
European Court of Justice has confirmed that lawyers may, in some
circumstances, set up in another member state under home title without
ever having to register with the local bar association.

The court ruled in favour of a German lawyer who had been prevented
from operating in Italy by the Milan Bar Association.

Reinhard Gebhard, who is registered as a German rechtsanwalt in
Stuttgart, had operated in Italy since 1978. However, the Milan Bar
Association initiated disciplinary proceedings against him. It
reproached him for using the term "avvocato" and designating his office
as "Studio Legale Gebhard".

The Italian authorities sought an interpretation of the 1977 Directive
on Lawyers' Services and Article 52 of the Treaty of Rome, particularly
focusing on when a member state could intervene to regulate activities.

The court determined that this could not be done unless a number of
conditions were met to justify that the restrictions were in the public
interest.

The judgment is being hailed as a victory for the liberal
interpretation of establishment rights which won the overwhelming
support of European lawyers at the November meeting of the CCBE in
Dresden. At that meeting, lawyers voted in favour of a permanent right
of establishment under home title against opposition from the French,
Spanish and Luxembourg bar delegations.

Patrick Oliver, the Brussels representative of the Law Society of
England and Wales, said bar associations will now have to look at what
activities are being performed by foreign lawyers to determine which
conditions are reasonable or not. It is likely the French will put up a
vigorous defence to show that restrictions in French law are compatible
with the public interest.

The judgment strongly suggests, however, that it would be unreasonable
for a bar association to seek registration for a lawyer who is
practising his own or EC law in another member state. But, Oliver
cautioned, the judgment is "fairly general and only gives pointers with
regard to the establishment debate". It does not, for example, give
specific details on when a local bar can seek registration.

But he added that the legal position"is becoming clearer and clearer",
something that has eluded European lawyers for the last decade.

RUSSIA:  FOREIGN FIRMS APPLY FOR LICENCES

In spite of a lack of clarity surrounding the registration procedure
for foreign lawyers in Russia, most foreign firms have decided to apply
for the relevant licences.

Among the firms contacted by LI, most had either received the licence
or were in the process of applying for one.

US firm LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae has already received a licence and
its resident partner in Moscow, Brian Zimbler, said the application
process took only a few weeks and the attitude of the government was
friendly. "The situation is that the licence entitles you to advise on
law in which your lawyers are licensed," Zimbler said. "Nevertheless,
the situation is not really that clear, it is clear that the government
is recognising us officially. Yet it is not clear how the licence works
and the scope of the licence is also unclear."

Another lawyer, however, whose firm has also applied for the licence,
looks on the confusion in a different light and believes the lack of
clarity is just an excuse made up by some firms which did not want to
comply.

"Public policy requires that one must impose guidelines on the legal
profession and Russia has been one of the last countries to do so," he
said."Indeed, the restrictions are less onerous than in the
jurisdictions that the people who are complaining about the rules come
from."

IRELAND:  SOLICITORS MAY ACHIEVE HIGHER STATUS IN COURTS

In a controversial move, the Irish Government has permitted solicitors
to become supreme and high court judges after serving four years as a
circuit court judge. Previously, solicitors were only allowed to be
appointed district judges, the lowest ranking judge in Ireland.

The decision comes after a heated debate between the rival professional
bodies governing solicitors and barristers with the donning by
solicitor-judges of the judge's wig forming a major stumbling block.

In the event, the original government proposal - that solicitors be
eligible for direct appointment to the higher court benches -
 was watered down to the general satisfaction of the barristers.

James Nugent, chairman of the Irish Bar which represents barristers, is
happy with the decision. However, the law society's attorney general,
Ken Murphy, merely looks on the decision "as a small step in the right
direction".

With countries such as the UK, Australia and New Zealand allowing the
direct appointment of solicitors to the upper reaches of the bench, the
solicitors are likely to continue pressing for change."To exclude
solicitors from judicial positions is a relic of history and works
against the public interest," Murphy said.

With both sides lobbing well-worn arguments back and forth, a working
group is to be set up by the government to monitor the progress and
suggest changes. Representatives from both professional groups and
third party observers will sit on it.

Nugent does not foresee that there will be further change in the next
few years. However, Murphy intends to use the working group to actively
lobby the government.

INTERNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION LAUNCHES HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE

The International Bar Association (IBA) has launched a human rights
institute which will operate through five committees located across the
globe. The institute will be headed by New South Wales Director of
Public Prosecutions Nicholas Cowdery QC and the former head of the Oslo
Bar, Tor Bohler. Speaking at the launch, IBA president Ross Harper
highlighted the importance of supra-national courts in securing human
rights gains. "The question of human rights is too important to be left
to the whim of an individual government," he said."While a government
may protest about a decision before the Court of Human Rights, it must
accept the decision. This is the essence of the rule of law - the right
of representation, a fair hearing and a proper determination must be
accepted."

EU CARTEL PROPOSALS

Proposals to encourage companies to inform on illegal price-fixing
cartels were put forward by the European Commission in December. Based
on successful moves in the US, the plans envisage the waiving of fines
for companies that are the first to inform on cartels, and reduce fines
for those that co-operate once an investigation has started.
Competition commissioner Karel Van Miert said it is preferable to
eliminate illegal price-fixing cartels, rather than imposing fines when
they are discovered.

NEW SOUTH WALES LAW SOCIETY SUBSIDIARY

Clients of solicitors in the Australian state of New South Wales may
have unwittingly subsidised the state's main professional body, the NSW
Law Society. A recent financial report found that the law society
received almost A$723,000 ($534,290) from the Solicitors' Trust Account
Fund (STAF). The money came from interest paid on trust funds held on
behalf of clients by the STAF.

ARTHUR ANDERSEN IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH DORMAN JEFFREY

Arthur Andersen continues to push into the legal services market. The
firm is believed to be in negotiations with Scottish firm Dorman
Jeffrey, although the Glasgow-based firm has officially denied any link-
up. However, any involvement by Arthur Andersen is likely to be in the
form of an association as Scottish professional rules forbid multi-
disciplinary partnerships.

LAW SOCIETY CONVEYANCING PLANS IN DISARRAY

Plans by Martin Mears, the controversial new head of the English Law
Society, to set conveyancing fees have fallen into disarray. Attempts
to withdraw indemnity insurance from lawyers offering cut-price
conveyances failed when the proposal went to vote at a recent council
meeting. Meanwhile, the law society is seeking a QC's opinion on the
legality of the plan.

OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS

Bob Gordon of Hanover Park Legal Services discusses important areas of
risk to partners and partnerships that are rarely considered until it
is too late

ALL PARTNERSHIPS are potentially exposed to a reduction in cashflow by
the temporary absence of a partner. And while the absentee's workload
might be spread among his or her colleagues in the short term, longer-
term cashflow inevitably suffers.

The following four examples highlight the risks and the importance for
law firms to secure appropriate insurance cover.

Example: A partner is expected to generate fees of about #300,000
($500,000) during the next 12 months. None of the individual colleagues
either possesses the skill or has the confidence of clients that would
allow the practice to generate this income in the partner's absence. If
the lawyer is ill, he or she will receive an income of #100,000 per
annum during the first 12 months of absence.

The exposure of the practice is therefore the lost fees of #300,000,
plus the #100,000 that the partner will receive at a time when they are
generating no income - a total of #400,000. This is bound to have an
impact on the income of the other partners, who must shoulder the
resulting financial burden. If spread among ten partners, the cost
would be #40,000 each.

The partnership also risks having to buy out colleagues who retire due
to ill-health. The sources of credit available to partnerships are less
extensive than those to which incorporated companies can turn and,
unlike companies, partnerships do not have large amounts of liquid
assets on the balance sheet which can be used to pay a "golden good-
bye".

Example: A partner suffers a stroke and can no longer perform demanding
duties. The fellow partners must buy him out, each paying #300,000.
There are two sources of finance available: personal assets or borrowed
money. The former eats into personal hard-won wealth, while the latter
creates a debt to be serviced and repaid.

The above problems also affect individual partners, especially where a
disabled partner has skills not possessed by his or her colleagues or
whose personal contacts generate income.

The major partner risk, however, relates to permanent incapacity.
Senior lawyers will normally be taxed under Schedule D. Being self-
employed, they cannot participate in an occupational pension scheme,
but will instead have personal pensions to provide income after
retiring.

Two factors create a considerable risk:

* Contributions payable under a personal pension are restricted by the
Inland Revenue. One would have to contribute the maximum possible
amount for many years before a large fund would have accrued.

* Such a fund would be used to purchase an annuity, the "cash for
pension exchange rate", which will be principally determined by the
individual's age. The younger the person, the worse the annuity rate,
and thus the lower the pension.

The younger one is, therefore, the smaller the pension fund and the
worse the annuity rate. Solicitors are in a precarious position when it
comes to early retirement enforced by ill-health.

Example: A 50-year-old partner has to retire due to ill-health. He has
paid maximum contributions allowed by the Inland Revenue and has
amassed a pension of #300,000. The annuity rate for a 50-year-old
provides a"cash for pension exchange rate" of 30:1. A fund of #300,000
therefore provides a pension of only #10,000 per annum. This is 10
percent of his pre-disability income of #100,000.

EC ISSUES DRAFT ON BANKING DIRECTIVE

The European Commission has just published a draft communication on two
key aspects of the Second Banking Directive (89/646/EEC). Chris Ffinch
of Cameron Markby Hewitt, Brussels, explains its implications

THE DRAFT communication on the Second Banking Directive defines what
amounts to providing cross-border services, and also provides guidance
about what restrictions host states may impose on banks as being in the
"general good".

The Second Banking Directive came into force on January 1 1993. It
provides for a single EU-wide banking authorisation (or "passport").
This allows for a streamlined notification procedure when credit
institutions - and in some cases their banking subsidiaries - wish to
conduct banking activities across borders (right to provide services)
or to establish a branch in another member state (right of
establishment).

All a credit institution's banking activities throughout the EU are
subject to supervision by the authorities in the member state where its
head office is located. This is known as "Home State Control".

"Host States" - member states where a bank exercises its right of
establishment or its right to provide services - have very limited
supervisory functions. They can only insist that a "foreign" credit
institution operating there complies with certain rules - rules which
they have to justify as being "in the general good".

The draft begins by reminding readers that all credit institutions must
comply with the notification procedure laid down in the directive
before they start to provide cross-border services. It then comments
that, since the obligation is to notify only when cross-border services
are carried on for the first time, some credit institutions may not
need to go through this procedure.

These exemptions are for credit institutions which had carried on cross-
border services before the directive came into force, even if banking
services were only provided on one occasion. The only condition the
commission would impose is that the provision of such cross-border
services must have been lawful.

What is cross-border banking?

The draft then examines exactly what amounts to providing cross-border
banking services. It considers that this can be done in three ways.

The first is where there is "movement on the part of the service
provider", that is, the credit institution itself. This would, for
example, include where deposits are accepted in a different member
state other than through a subsidiary or branch. Deposits - or more
likely perhaps withdrawals - might be made from an electronic machine.

Alternatively, the credit institution might send its own
representatives for a short period to another member state, or it might
temporarily appoint a local agent there.

The second possibility is where it is the customer who "moves". The
draft considers that, where a customer leaves his state of residence
and obtains banking services from a credit institution in another
member state, there may be provision of cross-border services - but
only if he has been subject to "commercial canvassing".

In effect, where the customer acts on his own initiative, no
notification is necessary. On the other hand, if there has been
commercial canvassing by the credit institution in the member state of
the customer's residence, it has conducted cross-border services
business there. This way of providing services is likely to come as an
unwelcome surprise to some banks. Many have been under the impression
that, as long as they do not move any of their operations abroad, they
have not conducted cross-border business.

The third way in which cross-border services can be provided is where
it is the service itself which moves. This covers what the draft calls
"modern" means of communication, such as the telephone, fax, telex and
electronic mail.

Again, the draft distinguishes between whether the service is provided
on the customer's initiative, or whether it follows commercial
canvassing by the credit institution in the state where the customer
resides.

Advertising or canvassing?

The draft states clearly that canvassing amounts to providing cross-
border banking services. It reasons that canvassing amounts to an
intention to carry on cross-border services, therefore a notification
is necessary. This must be questionable. Effectively, a mere offer to
provide services is treated identically to actually providing those
services.

The draft then attempts to explain what canvassing is. It comments that
advertising is not necessarily canvassing, although making the
distinction is not always easy. The starting point is that advertising
is "simple promotion". Canvassing, on the other hand, can be one of two
activities.

First, it is where an advertisement is placed and is followed by a
journey to the member state concerned by the credit institution in
order to conclude a contract. So, where a credit institution places an
advertisement and intends to follow this up with a visit to the
consumer's state of residence, it provides cross-border services. It
must go through the notification procedure before contacting the
consumer.

The other way of canvassing is to issue an "actual invitation", at a
distance, to enter into a contract. According to the draft, an actual
invitation is an advertisement which contains sufficient information
(e.g. as to interest rate, duration and cost) for the consumer to be
able to make up his mind, or one in which, thanks to the methods used,
it is possible to conclude the contract at a distance (e.g. by reply
slip or telephone).

So, if an advertisement does not contain sufficient information for the
contract to be concluded without the consumer needing physically to
visit the credit institution, it cannot be an "actual invitation". The
advertisement does not amount to canvassing.

This is not an easy test to apply. What amounts to sufficient
information for one customer is not necessarily sufficient for another.
The test also seems unnecessarily strict; there is a danger that, by
including what it considers to be no more than minimal details and a
contact telephone number in an advert published in another member
state, a credit institution may be considered to be carrying on
services business there.

What credit institutions see as no more than a routine advertising
campaign may amount to canvassing and necessitate a notification.

Provision of services and establishment

Different notifications are necessary, depending on whether the credit
institution wishes to set up a branch in the host state, or to conduct
cross-border services there. Again, distinguishing these two is not
always easy.

The main conceptual difference is that providing service is more
temporary in nature, whereas establishing a physical presence in the
form of a branch has more of an air of permanence, But there is no
reason why cross-border services should not be provided permanently.

The draft focuses on a number of problem areas. One is independent
intermediaries. The key issues are how much authority the
intermediaries have to bind the credit institution, and how much
freedom they have. This freedom relates both to the extent to which
they are subject to the control of the credit institution (the more,
the more likely it is to be a branch) and the extent to which they are
free to bind the credit institution in relation to third parties
(again, the more, the more likely it is to be a branch).

In order to be a branch, there must also be an element of permanence.
The draft provides a cursory review of the case law and concludes that,
in order to be considered a branch, an independent intermediary must
act exclusively for a single credit institution, must be able to
negotiate on behalf of the credit institution and commit the latter,
and must operate on a permanent basis.

This conclusion is open to question. Certainly, case law does not
really support the exclusivity point; in fact, it seems rather to
contradict it.

Where an office is staffed by the credit institution's own staff, the
draft communication states that a distinction must be made. Where the
staff carry on banking activities, it is likely to be a branch. On the
other hand, where they are simply part of a contact (representative)
office, it is probably not a branch.

Finally, the draft discusses the consequences of a failure by the
credit institutions to notify, and the consequences of the wrong type
of notification. It considers that notification is an administrative
procedure and cannot have an impact on the validity of any banking
contracts.

The general good

The Second Banking Directive states that credit institutions operating
either a branch or by way of cross-border services must obey the rules
of the host state adopted in the interest of the general good.

The first main difficulty is that the draft confirms that, under EC
law, member states do not have to provide details of exactly what these
rules are. Clearly, this does not make complying with them any easier.
A more robust approach from the commission would be welcome.

The draft communication reviews the case-law relating to the general
good and confirms that any such measure must:

* protect the general good;

* be non-discriminatory and apply to the host state's "own" credit
institutions as well as to"foreign institutions"; and

* be proportionate to the objective pursued. It should be noted that
provisions in the general good cannot be applied to areas which have
already been harmonised, such as in relation to the solvency ratio or
large exposures. This would amount to duplication.

Examples of rules protecting the general good include consumer
protection, the prevention of fraud, the cohesion of the taxation
system and protection of the reputation of the national financial
services industry.

The draft also highlights what is often overlooked. In assessing the
proportionality (a sort of reasonableness test) of a host state's
restrictions, a different measure applies, depending on whether the
restriction is applied to a branch or to the provision of services. In
general, less onerous measures should be applied to services business.

Regrettably, the draft does little more than review the case law. It
does not comment on actual banking restrictions imposed by some member
states.

The commission's decision to consult on its draft communication is to
be welcomed. It should lead to a better text. Certainty is desired by
those credit institutions wishing to exercise their passport rights.

Nevertheless, a number of difficulties do exist with the text as it
stands. Interested parties have until the end of February 1996 to send
their comments on the draft to the commission.

AN INTERNATIONAL BONANZA

With the domestic economy flat, Canadian law firms are looking abroad
for expansion opportunities. Michael Fitz-James reports

In the domestic legal services market, Canada's 45,000 practising
lawyers are facing tough times as a flat economy means fewer clients to
go around. But on the international scene, things are getting brighter
and brighter, as firms large and small share in a bonanza from a
growing global legal services market.

Gordon Proudfoot, president of the Canadian Bar Association (CBA), is a
lawyer with the Boyne Clarke firm in Halifax, Nova Scotia and laments
the number of law students being "churned out by Canada's 22 law
schools".

This has, he said, created a dramatic oversupply of legal labour and
when students can't land jobs, they go into business as sole
practitioners. There are now 9,000 of them - 20 percent of the lawyers
in Canada - many working "out of their homes with a cellular phone and
a laptop and low overheads", Proudfoot said.

They effectively compete with small to medium-sized law firms and have
resulted in a net drop in legal fees across the country.

The only way for firms to survive, according to Proudfoot, is to
specialise, and that's led to the "boutique" law firm - six or seven
lawyers who practise in a highly-specialised area, like intellectual
property, taxation or labour law.

Other medium-sized firms have been broken up by poor market conditions,
with some members forming into boutiques and others being swallowed up
by the big firms, which increasingly consolidate into larger entities.

But there is growth in selling legal services beyond Canada's borders,
and that's being driven both by the increasing globalisation of all
economic activity and rapid technological change.

Wynton Semple, a partner in the medium-sized Toronto firm Zammit Dash
and Semple, has client relationships and business being developed in
jurisdictions as far away as Australia, and the firm keeps in touch
through e-mail and other communications technology.

The firm specialises in computer technology law and it increasingly
finds clients' problems arise outside Canada, mostly in the US, where
many opportunities exist because of the North American Free Trade
Agreement.

For the giant "national" firm McCarthy Tetrault, which has 560 lawyers
in seven Canadian cities and in London, growth is unquestionably being
driven by the firm's international work.

"If we were limiting our activities to the Canadian domestic market,
there would clearly be a limit on our growth," said James McCartney,
Q.C., a senior McCarthy partner.

"The phenomenon of globalisation is affecting other high Canadian
corporations. With the rapid development of technology and the
reduction of trade barriers around the world, you can go anywhere and
essentially provide your services - hook up with your base in Canada,
produce documents and deal with specialists in the same way as if
they're down the hall at the office," McCarthy said.

For large firms, McCartney said, there are three "building blocks" for
the development of an international legal business strategy:

* working with foreign investors who want to set up deals in Canada;

* working with Canadian companies seeking deals abroad; and

* foreign "project work" which doesn't involve Canada, but which relies
on Canadian legal expertise.

It's project work where McCarthy Tetrault and other Canadian firms see
big opportunities for growth, particularly when their specialisation
positions them to offer foreign clients a particular expertise.

Canada's resource-based economy has contributed to McCarthy Tetrault's
extensive experience in the highly-regulated electrical energy, oil-gas
and mining sectors. As well, Canada is a telecommunications leader, and
the firm also has considerable experience there as well.

The firm has been able to market that expertise in a number of deals
around the globe including the privatisation of a gold mine in
Kazakhstan and setting up a telecommunications regulatory
infrastructure for the Indonesian Government.

"Internationally," said the CBA's Gordon Proudfoot, "Canadian lawyers
are nicely positioned for international work, because of the politics
of our country and the reputation we have internationally. We are not
as aggressive as the Americans are perceived to be, yet we do have all
those interesting nuances that come from the English law - plus Quebec
has a civilian legal tradition. We're seeing Canadian lawyers doing
very well abroad - that's a real trend that will continue to grow. The
international Canadian lawyer has a very prosperous future ahead."

While technological change may assist the globalisation phenomenon,
others see a worrisome trend in its efficiencies actually reducing the
need for legal labour.

"The understanding of legal problems and the search for their solutions
is increasingly being viewed as a branch of software development,"
pointed out Toronto's Wynton Semple.

"The client who used to pay $150 for a will can find a similar level of
service provided for $29.95 on the shelves of the local software store.
This `canned intelligence' presents a challenge to the practice of law
in Canada and lawyers are making a serious mistake if they believe
these packages are only purchased by low-level consumers," Semple
said.

Indeed, McCartney said, in larger firms, much corporate finance work
has been replaced by a multiple-jurisdiction software which clients
purchase themselves and use to generate prospectuses and disclosure
documents formerly prepared by lawyers.

In other technology trends, firms large and small are leaping on the
Internet bandwagon.

"The Internet phenomenon is amazing," Proudfoot said. "Canada is a
sparsely populated country and we love communications gizmos. Lawyers
are falling in love with the Internet - the concerns about its security
are falling away rapidly."

Governments both federal and provincial in Canada have finally decided
to reduce their staggering public debt load and that too is having a
major impact on the legal services marketplace.

It's an opportunity for larger firms, McCartney said, as "debt
reduction is driving a need to finance infrastructure in new ways - the
private sector is increasingly involved in financing roads, sewers and
waterworks. We're even acting for the province of New Brunswick in
building a new provincial jail that will be operated by the private
sector."

As well, in Canada's largest province, a newly-elected Conservative
Government is vowing to privatise many public undertakings - including
the giant Ontario Hydro, North America's largest electrical utility.
That will have a "major impact" on the legal services market, McCartney
predicted.

But for smaller firms and sole practitioners, major cutbacks on legal
aid are having a less-than-salutary impact on lawyers, who see their
incomes declining and a longer wait for their bills to be paid.

Many are looking for other areas of practice said legal marketing
consultant Mary Ann Freedman of Toronto, who predicted a dramatic rise
in professional negligence suits, particularly since provincial
governments are expected to allow American-style contingency fees,
where a winning lawyer is paid from the lawsuit proceeds.

Finally, there has been a significant rise in the number of in-house
corporate counsel in Canada, as companies seek to minimise the cost of
legal services. The number, according to Michael Crawford, editor of
Canadian Lawyer magazine is now around 5,000 and the trend of the late
1980s for companies to"outsource" all legal work to law firms has
reversed itself.

McCarthy Tterault's James McCartney said it is true the number of in-
house lawyers is on the rise but these handle mostly routine corporate
work which is fast disappearing from the larger firms' workload.

Now the work outside firms get tends to be in more specialised areas -
like taxation, labour and intellectual property.

The large firms, he said, have the people and resources to develop this
kind of specialisation and offer it competitively to larger companies,
which appear to be eager takers.
