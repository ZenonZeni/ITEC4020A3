Would go re: raising interest rates. Well, surprise, surprise, the Fed. accommodated the incumbent President yet again. I don't even know why I delayed the newsletter to tell the truth. Fed. Watching as an investment strategy seems an absolute "mug's game." Yet famous Wall Streeters are reverently consulted by Barron's or The Wall Street Journal.<p>On a different note, a recent article about the opinions of <i>former</i> Federal Reserve Governors, the majority opinion was for no rate increases until after the Presidential elections. Although present Fed. Governors strenuously deny accommodating the incumbent President, past governors claim that the closeness of the elections will cause the Fed. to hold off raising rates. Several Fed. Alumni also mention that the US economy could well slow down of its own accord during the latter part of the year-<i>removing the need for higher interest rates</i>.<p>With a weaker economy than the US, there is more room for the Bank of Canada to lower Canadian interest rates and boost bond prices. Bonds have been a buy for three months now. Unfortunately, bond prices still haven't moved <i>enough</i> to give us a big pocketful of profits. It feels like a patience game for a while. US government bonds are starting to rally now. Maybe an increase in impetus on the US side will boost our bond prices.<p>I notice that a small rally in the Canadian dollar is under way. We are shedding our Banana Republic image. Hooray for provincial balanced budget plans! OOPS, but what are the Feds doing??<p>Our inflationary measures are lagging at the moment. The CRB Index of seventeen commodities is on a downswing as prices of corn and soybean futures fell from soaring summer highs. Likewise, petroleum products have declined since the recent Iraqi skirmish. </td><td> &nbsp</td><td background="../images/tbltile.gif" bgcolor=#c6d6c6 valign=top><center><img src="../images/spacer.gif" width=95 height=2><br><img src="../images/charts.gif" width=80 height=15><font face="Arial" size=-1><hr noshade color=#297b63></center>Note: Charts are<br>designed for full<br>screen viewing.<p><center><b><a href="charts/10yrustb.gif">10 Yr.
