<B>Project Title:  Virtual Proving Grounds <p>

Performing Organization: The University of Iowa</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Prof. Edward J. Haug, (319) 335­5726</P> 

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>A high fidelity virtual proving ground is being developed for prototyping family sized
automobiles with hybrid­electric drives. Upon implementation, such vehicles will be simulated in the vehicle virtual
proving ground being developed by the University of Iowa, using validated electric powertrain subsystem models
and data provided by the PNGV Systems Analysis Team.</P>

<P>The goal of the project is to (1) create a proving ground design that includes high fidelity models of a family size
passenger vehicle for which conventional powertrain data are available, (2) implement in subsequent projects a
spectrum of hybrid­electric powertrain models in driving simulator dynamics software with data that have been
validated by industry partners, and (3) to subsequently test and demonstrate differences between performance and
derivability of the validated conventionally powered vehicle and hybrid­electric powered vehicle systems using the
driving simulator­based proving ground. </P>

<P>For a typical hybrid­electric vehicle model, the virtual proving ground will support the following capabilities: (1) A
high fidelity multibody mechanical dynamics simulation program; (2) A state space modeling capability for general
algebraic and differential equations; (3) A mathematical library that includes linear algebra, optimization and
numerical integration functions; (4) Specific technical libraries for modeling control algorithms and electric circuits;
(5) Specific technical libraries for modeling mechanical force modules; (6) A numerical library for data
representation and reporting; and (7) A model animation tool.</P>

<P>Even though models could be built using a high level computer language, such as C or FORTRAN, in order to
design an effective virtual proving ground for hybrid­electric vehicles, computer packages that have been designed
specifically for simulation of general dynamic systems that are currently being used in the engineering community
represent a better choice. MATLAB will be used as the simulation environment for the virtual proving ground. Due
to the complexity of vehicle models and the availability of vehicle models with different degrees of fidelity, DADS is
chosen as the multibody dynamics simulation program. DADS version 8.0 includes the interface necessary to
interact with MATLAB. Within the MATLAB environment, a hybrid­electric power system model is constructed
using the SIMULINK graphic simulation language, built in numerical functions, and application specific ' libraries
(toolboxes). If the degree of complexity of the core mechanical vehicle model is anything but simplified, then a
model within the DADS 8.0 environment will be linked to the model in MATLAB. </P>

<P>Parallel technology developments being carried out by the University of Iowa are implementing and validating
selected components of the virtual proving ground. The driving simulation environment created under
complementary DoD and DOT projects using the Iowa Driving Simulator (IDS), and ultimately the National
Advanced Driving simulator (NADS) whose development is proceeding under funding of $47 million from the DOT
and State of Iowa, is enabling this project to focus on unique aspects of hybrid­electric vehicles. A modular
structure for simulation of drivetrain and control subsystems that are typical of electric and hybrid­electric vehicles
is being designed to be compatible with subsystem models being developed under complementary ARPA and
DOT support. Using this design, high fidelity models of electric and hybrid­electric vehicle subsystems developed
by a number of organizations can be integrated into real­time software that is operational on the Iowa Driving
Simulator. This fundamentally new capability will also be implemented in a non­real­time computer aided
engineering (CAE) environment, for use by DoD, coalition partners, and the PNGV.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P>The design of a high fidelity hybrid­electric vehicle virtual proving ground will be delivered to
guide work in subsequent application projects for (1) creating highly realistic hybrid­electric vehicle models that
can be used for subsystem testing and development in a broadly applicable hybrid­electric vehicle virtual proving
ground, (2) integrating vehicle models and data that are based on extensively tested contemporary hybrid­electric
powertrain subsystems, (3) supporting test and validation or vehicle electric power subsystem models that are
being developed under the ARPA hybrid-electric combat vehicle program, and (4) providing a unique new capability
for PNGV to carryout tradeoff studies involving vehicle handling and derivability.</P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>

<P><UL><LI>Virtual proving ground design will be completed by October, 1996.</UL></P>
