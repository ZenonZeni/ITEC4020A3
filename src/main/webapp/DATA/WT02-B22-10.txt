<LI>Good, but should be limited in access to consenting adults only
<LI>INTERESTING!
<LI>I believe that censorship should be a joint colaboration between the parents/guardians and the ISP. This should be in the form of parental certification of certain sites and the ISP giving parents the information to do so. This will still not stop net searces like piercing returning pictures of pierced nipples and clits!
<LI>I am a single Christian, so I am committed to sexual purity/abstinence. The internet could be tempting for people like me. Unfortunately, integrity has no privacy, there is no safe sin, and God's Grace motivates me to please Him.
<LI>fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I'm all for it.  It's a healthy way to let out sexual frustrations, learn new things, and become more open about human sexuality!  I do feel that minors should have absolutly no access to this stuff though and I wish there was some way to completely monitor that. 
<LI>Its a good thing
<LI>It's amazing that all technology somehow gets to sex or becomes sex related.
<LI>It amazing that all technology somehow gets to sex or becomes sex related.
<LI>It is a wonderful experience and it is the only way I will continue to have intercourse.
<LI>Sex on the net should remain and if people don't like it then don't search for it!!!
<LI>The Internet provides adults with access to materials that could only be purchased previously through the mail or through seedy little shops.  While I do not support minors' access to adult sites, I do believe that regulation should be up to parents.  I do not ever want to see the government deciding what I can do, say, or look at on the Internet.
<LI>I enjoy reading about sex and viewing pictures on the internet.  I feel that sex should be open for people to talk about and to  view, as long as they are ready and willing to.
<LI>It is great!
<LI>More info on getting laid!
<LI>It is not the business of any governing body, federal, state, or international, to dictate what content is available on the net, or to whom content is available.
<LI>its just for fun
<LI>I feel that it should not be completely banned but that it has to be some what regulated.  Parents need to be more involved with what their children are doing.  Web page owner should be more responsible and use lock outs, and parental control programs, they should not allow just anyone access.
<LI>Internet has at least made stop buying Hustler, Swank, etc...  I am not paying for pornography so I'm not supporting it, I think.
<LI>I think sex on the 'Net should be upgraded to interactive, 4-Dimensional virtual reality sex with add-ons to improve size and endurance. This should be available to all people over the elderly age of 4. I think sex is good and all should be able to enhance life by enjoying sex in its bountiful pleasure.
<LI>I didn't believe in censorship until my students told me what they came across on the Internet. Now, I've changed my mind.
<LI>it:s ok if you don"t like it do not browse for it      
<LI>I think it is used in a way that is described as easy to control if you wanted
<LI>It's fine with me as long as it doesn't get seen by children. 
<LI>It should be in the bedroom, not on the computer!
<LI>I believe it is a forum that is overwhelmingly used by men. Withour women it is not sex on the internet rather masturbation on the internet.
<LI>often very good! often very dirty!!
<LI>some of it is quite educational
<LI>What Diss All Be Like ?
<LI>It's obviously a vocal minority that opposes (publically) sexual materiel on the net.  Compare the # of "hits" on sex-related sites compared to other sites; human beings love (and crave) sex!  And PARENTS should take care of their children, not leave it to the government!!!!! 
<LI>no comment
<LI>I think that sex on the Internet is completely harmless, though I do think that children should not be allowed access to certain materials. Aside from that, I don't see a problem with it.
<LI>I like sex on Internet!1
<LI>Sex is a private matter between husband and wife - NOT for public consumption!
<LI>keep clean sex on the internet
<LI>Its Great!
<LI>You really have to be LOOKING for sexual content on the Net.  Also, any idea of regulating or censoring material on the Internet as a whole is rather farfetched -- it simply cannot be effectively regulated
<LI>I think some of the stuff that is out there is just completly for sick, messed-up individuals while the majority of the sites are good in other giving facts and advice or helping to open up communication.
<LI>It is interesting
<LI>better gate-keeping is essential . . . or the appropriate authorities WILL shut it down
<LI>It should be left alone.  We have programs that limit what they can see (if we wish to use them).  Closing internet would be like closing the phone line down because of 976 numbers.
<LI>If it's to control it, it may
<LI>an entirely new way to meet and encounter different people....the ultimate safe sex !!
<LI>I would like to find someone ( a woman that I could get off with on the net and then meet and do it in person,  I am very good.
<LI>The openness is the best. I would like the prices to be cheaper
<LI>I think as in real life sex has it's place on the net. I do however think that child porn should not be allowed and when found it should be deleted one way or another..
<LI>I think all sex on the net should be free. But I'll never pay for an Adult Check, let the parents of minors take the responsibility to get Net Nanny or some such software !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>like it very much.....
<LI>You gotta get a cam, that's the best for encountering sexual materails 
<LI>I think it's wounderful.  I think it's helped out marriage.  It's hepled my wife and I  talk more about it.  I enjoy talking to my friends about it.  It's good fun.  
<LI>Sex on the net is great
<LI>the more the better and make it FREE!
<LI>I think the internet should be completely free. If some of the content offends some people, then don't look there! If a group of people find something offensive on the net and request regulation on it, then there would be regulations on everything. It would never end. And besides, do they really think that a few policies and blocks are going to stop people?
<LI>its cold and robotic..a sign of the times
<LI>no problem, as long as it's goverened by a responsible adult with in the receiving household
<LI>its useless
<LI>I currently own a site and I really enjoy the research and time I put into it.  I always wanted to be in the sex industry and now I can be without having the feeling of humalilty.  If you would like to see my site here's my adress www.cmebbad.com.  I hope
<LI>no comment
<LI>Dangerous to society
<LI>i've enjoyed the access i've had though i suspect that i've picked up viruses by so doing.
<LI>good
<LI>I think it's just another form like adult videos, or magazines, just a lot more interactive and convienent
<LI>I am totally opposed to any form of censorship, and i am copletely fascinated by the range of sexual activity, interest, energy I find on the net. My only problem is with the commercialisation of sex on the net which is fostered by political interference.
<LI>Sex has turned in to something selfish-people do it because "it feels good."   it is said to see National Morale on such a low level.
<LI>i'm really confounded about online morality, censorship issues.
<LI>The net does not show you what any Texas cornerstore can't. Smut rules and anyone denying that has never learned how fun it can be 
<LI>Sex is what I really want now!
<LI>I think it should be free and unrestricted. It is up to the parents to keep their kid's away from adult material. 
<LI>I want to play in an Animalporno
<LI>ithink this survey is stuid
<LI>it helps
<LI>I think its a way to waste time, get your partner into a sex mood, remember that were all still horny individuals underneath
<LI>I like sex, not over a computer.
<LI>Its one of the easiest forums of safe sex the world will ever know..
<LI>I am now hooked on the net for xxx only. My way out.
<LI>excellent, open forum for exploration and formation of communities with common interests. I enjoy erotic/adult pictures and stories on the net, and enjoy the open, evolving, convenient medium for borwsing,
<LI>I haven't had too much... but it is nice to know that I can turn others on in few words!!
<LI>Sex on the Internet is like Times Square. Do we wreck NYC to 'clean up' Times Square?      Times Square?
<LI>Very nice!
<LI>I think sex and sexual related subjects should be alowed to be discovered through the net by whoever wants the info.  No censorship!
<LI>entices but does not satisfy
<LI>A little is okay but I think it is obsessvie & too much
<LI>It's no different from buying a mag at the store only you can access live people if you wish. It will be available no matter what barriers are erected (no pun intended). Whatever block man can devise, man can devise a way to break it.
<LI>The liberals are absolutely wiping out any and all measure of morality with their self centered, deceptive promotions
<LI>I think it's great.  It's private, healthy and a good time.
<LI>Its ok by me,why not,can't see no harm,its part of ones life
<LI>I think that a rating system would be good.
<LI>good
<LI>Sex on the net is highly available and I say, all the better.  Information should be free and I despise the amount of censorship there is already.  Give me more SEX!! If I want it, that is.
<LI>The internet is a tremendous scource of knowledge for all age groups; sex is just one branch of the available information on the net.. No individual or authorative body has the moral right to dictate to any ADULT what he or she can or cannot access on the net; each ADULT individual is responsible for their own moral as well as physical wellbeing.
<LI>i think, just as in real life, parents should be responsble for what thier children use the internet for. i think the wab should be completly unristricted. i also think the libral government thinks were not responsible enough to thinkfor ourselves.i DISAGREE with any notion that the web should be restricted
<LI>Since i am a sexual open minded person it doesn't bother me
<LI>I think the Internet is a good outlet for one's sexual desires.
<LI>sex on the net teaches kids about puberty and their bodys and safe sex. and it teaches them about how to have sex
<LI>It tends to be very individual & allows for freedom of expression
<LI>I feel I should have full control over my own interests and how i pursue these interests...be it in real life or in cyberlife!
<LI>FANTASTIC
<LI>It's an easy way to get cheap thrills.
<LI>I don't think it is anyone's responsibility but the parent to control what their children have access to.
<LI>sex companies(comercials) should be separate area(gouped all together), so I have the opyion ob passing them.
<LI>Much ado about nothing.  Most of the material is inferior, immature, and mercenary in nature.  If I were looking for "sex" I could find a lot of better places than the Net.
<LI>I think it is too easy to get.  My daughter was on a chat line when someone posted a picture of a woman having sex with a Great Dane!   Disgusting!
<LI>too long!!!!
<LI>Sex is in the internet as it is in any place else. It is a reality and part of our day to day life.
<LI>Internet is only tool, like , for instance knife, which can be used for cooking and for killing. It is not wise to impose goverment regulations on ising knives, but it is reasonable, when parents keep their knives avay from children.
<LI>I don't understand how people can meet somebody online & leave their partners for them or fall in love with somebody they've never even met face to face! That's crazy!!!!Are these people starved for affection or what?
<LI>I find that sex is a wonderful act, and sex on the net does not exist so much as pornography on the net.  Children should learn about sex, but not necessarily have free access to pornography or sexually explicit material.
<LI>sex on the internet is very good.  Without it I wouldn't know what to do when I wasn't have real sex
<LI>i don't think it hurts anyone
<LI>bend over and give me more...
<LI>yahoooooooo
<LI>sex and the internet are a great combination
<LI>ok
<LI>i like the adult check, wish it could be done with out having to pay for it
<LI>It teaches kids about sex, so parents who do not discuss sex with their kids, it wouldn't really matter because they are learneing off the net
<LI>Where are the half-naked guy's pictures?
<LI>very nice
<LI>sex on the net is for fun and fantasy... there is alot of bad but that can apply to all areas...
<LI>I find that SEX on the net is a wonderful thing. It has opened many of sexual door for myself.
<LI>Sex kicks fucking ass,I think children should see all of it at the age of 10.The net sucks except for the pictures.
<LI>its not what its made out to be
<LI>tired of having to pay upfront, should get previews
<LI>is ok
<LI>I think that it is wonderful.  I get to see all kinds of sexual preferences and learn a lot about sex.
<LI>It provides an outlet for sexual questions
<LI>i think its a good thing going on here! its helped my sex life!!! i've learned new things to make bed time more fun!!!
<LI>I THINK SEX ON THE INTERNET SHOULD NOT BE CENSOED, IT'S UP TO THE PARENTS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THEIR OWN KIDS , NOT THE GOVERMENT
<LI>it doesn't interest me
<LI>very open minded to each his/her own!
<LI>i bumped into it.(sex on iternet)i wasn't even looking for it but i was pleased to find it . You have to define sex and pornography before you can restrict it and that is very difficult also who should and who shouldn't have acess is another contraversial topic. i think there should be an awareness and acknowledgement that it is outhere but there shouldn't be a total ban on it. That would just be pleasing the narrow minded conservitive people out there who want to protect there cottonwool exesistances 
f you ban sex in the internet you will be sebding a message that sex is "bad" and seen as naughty and that masturbation is an evil wicked and perverted thing to do when it is not!
<LI>Many sites seem to offer "blocking" software  but are linked to other pornographic material.  Perhaps if an internet related "committee" were established the said group could monitor for truth in promotion and censor servers who are dishonest.
<LI>I think that freedom of speech and the lack of censorship is something we should be proud of
<LI>142
<LI>GGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREAT
<LI>Masturbatory for kids
<LI>very like
<LI>Sex on the net as it is everywhere else.  Couldn't be stopped out there, can't stop it on-line either. Embrace sub-cultures or force them to be counter-culture.
<LI>it's a lot easier to access than i originally thought
<LI>sex and the internet are two great tastes thet taste great together
<LI>expensive
<LI>Sex in internet should be absolutely free.
<LI>It saves buying it from the newsagents
<LI>There's nothing wrong with it
<LI>I think it should be allowed.  
<LI>tis good!
<LI>it's not safe,  anyone can get it.
<LI>I think, if you desire to participate, you should be allowed to.  It has helped my wife and 
<LI>Hard to find good cheap stuff. They keep you going in loops.
<LI>access must be provided by parents
<LI>It´s a good thing!!!
<LI>its ok
<LI>All pornography tells us the lie that it's okay to behave in any way we feel we get the most  pleasure while roaming this planet -  a terrible lie many have believed and now suffer for having done that.
<LI>sex on the internet can be helpful to someone like me who has never had sex but often dreams of it.  It provides pictures for curious like me 
<LI>Sex on the internet for me has been a great experience.  I have become more open to new things and understand others fetishes far better.
<LI>Great for adults. Safe
<LI>love it- its totally safe
<LI>I think the net could provide some spiceyt material for couples to use to spice up their sexual experiences
<LI>I thing it is bad for real contacts
<LI>sex and the internet are cool.
<LI>sex should be left within the boundaries of marrige of a male and female.  it should NOT be accsessable to children.  pornography is sick (its also a sin) and should be TERMINATED!  homosexuallity is a sin and also sick and also should be TERMINATED!
<LI>mo answer
<LI>Good outlet to explore 
<LI>The Internet is global, crossing political, geographic, racial, religious and ethical boundaries.  It can not and should not be restricted.  Individuals should make their own decisions, and parents should accept responsibility for THEIR children.
<LI>The net is a great sexual outlet
<LI>I have been able to find some good material on foot fetishes, as I have a big female dirty sock fetish and female foot fetish.
<LI>Great to have easy access to many databases and information otherwise hard to find, i.e. film reviews or discussions on specific topics
<LI>I AM NOT SURE YET--I HAVENT SEEN TOO MUCH
<LI>1. All cecorship does is promote burocracy, 2. censorship perpetuates the stigmatization of anything with sexual content, when people (children) should be taught to feel free to discuss with their loved ones, something that could really be bothering them. 3. I wonder if letting children freely use "pornography", or even developing special sexual material for kids, would break the tradition of thinking they have to hide things from their parents.  
<LI>It´s ok
<LI>fdsg hfdgh fd
<LI>I enjoy perusing the various aspects of it and occasionally engaging in private conversations on the net.
<LI>I Dont Find A Lot Of Pictures Very Useful
<LI>Too new for me to say.
<LI>perfectly portrays human depravity
<LI>Taken outside of my subjective experience, I think that in general, sex on the internet allows a great deal more openness which is lacking in 'rl' society, and can help to clear up ambiguities.
<LI>  But, not for children!!!!!! It is fine for adults...
<LI>GROSS!
<LI>People see what people want to see. Children should be kept from this though. Untill they are old enough to understand.
<LI>no differant then buying it in mag. or film
<LI>illustration of sex allows a person to privately answer question they are too shy or embarrassed to ask or view in zine shops
<LI>hard to find the good stuff.  too much like real sex it get boring after only a few minutes.  At least with this there is no wet spot.
<LI>Sex is just one aspect of the Net; it is wonderful source of information of all kinds; it helps overcome taboos and illiteracy.
<LI>cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEX
<LI>Highly overrated
<LI>i believe in the 1st amendment. parents are responsible for making sure that their kids know the facts and what they will tolerate.
<LI>Love sex, love the internet--life is better with BOTH
<LI>The internet is a safe place for sex and can be fun if it's not used improperly. What adults choose to do with each other is totally up to them!
<LI>There needs to be more ways to pay for sex services on the Net.
<LI>Makes it easier to put your toes in the virtual water without having real-life complications. Easy to try out different virtual gender-oriented experiences. 
<LI>I think there is too much unregulated hard core on the net that anyone, children included can access.  Some form of identification should be provided by the service providers to identify who is using that service and their age.  The provider could pass out Handles with passwords for each member of a household subscribing to the service.  This way only children (under 21) who were given their parents logon info could access restricted sites.
<LI>The government can't regulate morality.
<LI>I think that it is a safe and healthy way to enjoy sex, provided that the extra precautions with younger people are identified.
<LI>I think eveyone should post naked pictures of themselves on the net.  Everybody should just get buck naked and fuck!!!!!!!
<LI>I am still relitively new on the net and have not foundor even know what I am looking for yet, still curious, and want to meet simmilar folks in or close to the area in which I live. 
<LI>Where are the naked men?
<LI>it's irritating to read the stupid coverage it gets in the newspapers.  most people who discuss this issue have obviously never even sat down and checked it out.  it takes about 30 seconds to use altavista or hotbot to search for "suck my dick" and see for yourself what there is - duhh
<LI>interesting
<LI>Masturbation is great.
<LI>It's a way people can have fun so just leave them alone
<LI>SEX ON THE INTERNET IS UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL NOT THE GOVERMENT. 
<LI>i love it...well sex in general, it adds to my sexual curiosity, and lets me be myself and yet who i'm not at the same time...the women i've on the web love it....and that's what makes me love it more....
<LI>VERY OPEN AND INFORMATIVE
<LI>People who write murder-mystery novels aren't murderers, so I feel that people who write "questionable" material are not "questionable".
<LI>I think that the way most sites are set up on the internet is good. My biggest problem is censorship! I am a 29yr old male in the military, and apparently I am not old enough to decide what I want to look at. It may just be me, but I think thats bullshit!
<LI>Where's the free stuff?
<LI>Morality is not the for the government to dictate.  They have divorced themselves from the relgious heritage that built this contry now they tell us they are going to tell us what is moral.  I don't think so.
<LI>Sex can be an embarrassing topic for someone to bring up, the internet simply allows one to explore one's curiosities...
<LI>Sex on the internet is windespread from the WWW, to IRC, and Newsgroups...
<LI>My name is Gary Ryno and I'm totally celibate; I don't have sex and I don't masturbate.
<LI>i'M AMBIVELANT
<LI>Sex on the Internet is a valuable sexual outlet for many including myself. No regulation should be imposed other than by concerned parents.
<LI>exellent
<LI>I love sex, I cant get enough of it and sex on the internet is great!.  
<LI>I enjoy it.  I am a college student and it makes a nice study break.
<LI>As I mentioned, there is lots of weird stuff out there. Very weird. 
<LI>I belive that s on the net is another form of detachment in which we are all falling prey. I feel that sex is both expressive and transendent; I fell that the casual peronalization of fantacy is healthy and typically encourages proper attitude about sex. I belive that censoring ones personal fanatcy leads to violent outcome (no pun intended) and will often result in rage or fustration that leads to violence. Censorship is too suppressive and the net may be the last frontire for free expression. I hope 
nd think that this is not the case, but we would all be fools to take the chance.
<LI>As an internet virgin my sexual encounter with the net was untraumatic.
<LI>I think there should be more of it.
<LI>It´s good for looking Pictures, readding sex-stories and so on. It´s like an adventure, surfing in the internet.
<LI>i love sex on the internet. it makes me more openminded. i never would have tried doing a guy without the internet. plus it's fun to masterbate while talking online. it's a real turn-on!
<LI>no response
<LI>No good material found that is not charging you
<LI>spam
<LI>There's a lot of hot air in the media and a lot of lying concernng "free" stuff when it comes to sex, be it either "free" pictures or whatever.  Because that business is still considered "underground" today, it sometimes looks very "cheap". I say it's about time that  real bisness' sort of naturally "impose" standards on the Net and everywhere else...
<LI>Well, I've had one "sexual" partner on the Net, and he and I are now engaged. We met on the Net 4 years ago, have been living together 2 years, and will be married in March. I'm in favor of Net love, and whatever it leads to.
<LI>Still a novice at this
<LI>IT RULES!!!!!!
<LI>I think it can be addictive and harmful for some, for others harmless clean fun.
<LI>The possibility of some inappropriate people, such as children, viewing sexual material should NOT mean the end of the Internet as an area for adults to engage in whatever type of free speech they desire.
<LI>have found nothing available to children, unless they have a credit card.  parents are responsable for their children, not the government, or net access providers.
<LI>I got a vibrator
<LI>you should be able to GET SOME from the net
<LI>I don't think that people should be penalized for parents inability to pay attention to what their children are doing.  Don't let the children have access to the internet, or just get AOL or something like that.  That is certainly easy to limit children's behaviour, and anyway, computers and television should not be used as babysitters
<LI>too easy
<LI>very good
<LI>very interesting
<LI>i think sex on the internet is a safe and private way to have involvment at whatever level you wish. I think as long as the adult members of a household take resposibility it can keep the access to minors under control.  
<LI>it is needed
<LI>I like finding a little something when I am in the mood, and my girlfriend is busy or tired.
<LI>I think the info is good for people but the porn and nasty talk is wrong and should be stoped
<LI>I think that as a sociaty we place to much =value on apperence and this kind of pornography encourages it more.
<LI>It's orgasmic!!!
<LI>I personally think that sex on the internet is good because I'd rather do it over the computer than get my dick dirty for real and catch a disease from it. Once you can stick your dick in a computer and catch one of their viruses, then I'll stop doing it.
<LI>It is very educating
<LI>I believe it should continue to be an open forum.  If people do not want to view this type of material, then they should not access these sites.  Let the overly righteous watch network t.v.!
<LI>that's great!!
<LI>It is great.  I love getting off on the internet
<LI>Generally speaking, I find a lot that I do not especially agree with.  However, sex on the net - and by virtue of its readily-accesible nature - has made me more aware of people's sexual behaviour.  It's also made me more open minded and has piqued curiosity in areas which I had never before considered (S&M, light bondage).  I believe that the Net should be open allowing "a place for everything" but should also be self-regulating; we as netizens should  watch for those individuals who are too weak/naiv
 of young to make their own decisions about formulting their own perceptions of ethical sexula practices.  A self-rating system on the net, adhering to democratically decided standards should exist.
<LI>I'm all for it
<LI>Overblown by an 'innocent' media
<LI>leave it alone. user choice
<LI>I think that sites should be able to post whatever they want to. Their are plenty of blocks that parents can put on their own systems.
<LI>kwijibo
<LI>no censorship...if you don't like it, don't look at it!  but don't tell me that i can't look at it because of your beliefs!
<LI>we love your web site, it is very open minded and neat.  Thanks.
<LI>i love porno!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yea 69
<LI>Fantastic!!!!
<LI>I really like the idea of being abel to find out anything on the net, including sex topics.  It is a shame that this country is so embarrased about who they really are and wht they like to do!  The internet is and should remain a persona of the people who use it and sex is part of that.
<LI>I totally encourage non censorship and the exchange of materieals or ideas between any consenting adults. If you're into it, and you're not hurting anyone, have fun.
<LI>Censorship of any kind is never a good thing.  Pedophilia is the only thing I believe should be banned from the net due to the nonconsentual and harmful nature of it.  Consentual adult sex of all kinds should be freely available for whatever purposes peop
<LI>i think there should be a way for parents to limit the amount of access their children have...such as aol. they have the right idea, children's access, teen access, & adult access. 
<LI>Sex is everywhere on the Net.  I do a channel listing on IRC and at least 75% of the chat rooms are about sex or mention it in their topics.  I'm not overly concerned about it all but would just like for you too know how it exists.  I make a nice profit selling pics on disk or zip drives to classmates at school for about $0.50 per pic! :)
<LI>The Internet Lets People open up their mind to thing they would not have possibly thought of otherwise.  Good or Bad...Censorship should be done on an indivuadal basis, by parents and such.  Not anyone else.
<LI>I really like it and lets me know what is new as far as sexual information goes 
<LI>Sex on the net is like sex on TV or video: not very interesting, just because nothing is real (and honest)
<LI>Where is all this sex in the Internet?!?!  I want to find some!!!!!!
<LI>Harmless, there is more porn available at the local supermarket. No big deal
<LI>I don't mind sexual site on the Internet but I do belive some of the non-concentual material and pedafile stuff should be dealt with as soon as it is spotted. Sometimes access to these types of sights is sometimes easier than it should be. But then again where do we draw the line between art and porn?
<LI>Net sex is rather dull and porn is a real yawn after 30 seconds. The moral uptight need to find another social laxative and leave net fucking alone. Perverts need an outlet so they don't commit sex crimes.
<LI>cyber clubs allow for those afraid of being sigmatized by participating in red light districts the ability to have similar experiences to those who are not afraid of being labeled. It can have long-run damaging effects, however; from the objectification o
<LI>Like many outlets for sex information in the media, video seems to be male oriented and text seems to be female oriented. I think people should be held responsible for their own actions; parents should be able to guide and discipline their own children without someone telling them to.
<LI>I think it is a great opportunity to explore sex in all its forms without hurting anyone else.
<LI>if it feels good do it
<LI>I'm not too totally interested in it..Actually, I'm amused by people who are aborbed by it..But I see no reason why it should looked at as such a big deal. Come on, people, it's a body. We all have one.
<LI>lots of porn on the internet, but no one can do anything about it....
<LI>I think it is just another topic that people want to find out about and it provides them an open opportunity too - I do think there should be like an adult check service or some age verification to prevent children getting on in SOME/MOST cases without the supervision of the adult
<LI>whoopee!
<LI>The questions about what to do about sex on the net is far too limited for an accurate reply, I think.  One option, for example is something similar to a "V" chip, where sex material can only be accessed if you have this device which will allow you to decode, or perhaps work it the other way around, a chip to censor it out so parents have control.
<LI>People get too worked up about sex and the internet and everything. There's way too much hype. If you don't want to see it, then don't look at it. Censorship is a stupid concept.
<LI>The problem with defining "sex on the net" is where do you draw the line?  The main reason I think it should be open is for the sake of under-18 friends of mine who realize they are gay or bisexual -- many "sexually oriented material" filters filter supportive information for these people too and this is NOT fair.  Furthermore, you do generally have to look for it to find anything *truly* offensive, and kids who are looking will find some way to get it anyhow -- I always did *grin*
<LI>I dont think gratuitous images of scantily clad women should be on the internet. Read and see what you like but make SURE kids cant get to it
<LI>sex on the internet for me is good because of my bisexuality i can go online and have cyber sex with another women and it is better then me going out and cheating on my husband. I would let my child go online and find sexually orientated material. it would be better then him having sex in real life and getting vd or getting a girl pregnant.
<LI>Some of it can be pretty sexy to read, lots of it is just boring and repetitive. (Course, sex can get that way too!) Certainly I would hate to see a govt related regulatory body regulating what I and other adults can or cannot look at. 
<LI>Creepy and a new and safe outlet-all at once!
<LI>Could be better, i want to find pedophilia picture, but didn' find any!
<LI>Puke puke puke, oh excuse me I was throwing up.  I think it stinks you perverted freaks.  I am telling your mother.  
<LI>Those who would force their views on what's available are the worst form of censor. It only promotes further ignorance.  Censorship OF ANY FORM sux the max.
<LI>It is not as important as always in the papers. I hardly know anybody who actually knows how to access hardcore nsites or even to enter news groups.
<LI>I feel it is acceptable for sex tro be on the internet providing that children do not have access to it. also that all Child pronography should be kept off the internet by some legal / protection groups . I believe that child pronography is sick!!
<LI>it's a free country. we should be able to access sex on the net 
<LI>Not as good as real life.
<LI>I love it.  My boy-girl friend thinks it is great after a long day at the fish plant.
<LI>WELL, WHEN I GO ON LINE, I"M LIKE A CAR. I GRIP MY 17INCH COCK AND START TO SHIFT MY GEARS. BOY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT MY NUDDIE TV. IT'S EITHER THIS OR KOJAK.    W  
<LI>Sex is one of the most exciting human activities but it has many risks, specially for health both phisical and psicological. Safe sex is a must. This means people need information about sex, and that learning should be done before having to make any decision about their own sexual acts. People should know about responsibility, for their own, and for the others.
<LI>I think that they need alot  more about sex and tell more about it.  also let someone who had it  many times tell about there wonderful time and how it felt!!
<LI>It will regulate itself in time. Those sites that are not desireable will not survive.
<LI>It doesnt really bother me. I take the opinion of, if you dont like it dont look at it. The Internet has nothing to do with sex unless you want it to.
<LI>I THINK IT,S OK
<LI>I can't say I find computers very sexy but I suppose for some people an innocent e-mail could be the start of a red hot electro-sexual relationship (oo-er).
<LI>fun
<LI>It serves as some sort of entertainment after a long working hours and I think it is something all guys will have and it can never be stoped completely.
<LI>Good but it could be better.
<LI>helps ;elleviate frustration
<LI>it's a candy store !
<LI>Sex is a participation sport, not a spectator sport.
<LI>???????????????/
<LI>Was checking sex just for curiosity
<LI>Keep up the good work , how ever I do wish more erotica was free!
<LI>I think that ther needs to be a switch in the serch engines to prevent sex site response unless prompted. This would prevent the kids from even seeing that there are sights available to click on. It is just too easy to take a wrong turn when in search engines and get a sexually explicit image!
<LI>as long as there are rating systems and ways children are unable to see it, then go ahead
<LI>I think its great. You can be yourself in every way.
<LI>I am all fro sex on the net.  We just need an regulation to rate it and thats all and a standard put into HTML code to tell browsers the rate for this type of document.
<LI>I think that there should be a rating system, but no censorship.
<LI>Tame mosst of the time, with way to much sex for sale crap
<LI>It`s great! It`s freedom.
<LI>I don't see how the Internet can be "policed".  It should be open to all.  Parents who have no supervision over their children deserve the children they end up with!
<LI>I think pornography on the net is awesome.  The net is one of the last almost totally uncensored areas in the world, where a free exchange of information takes place and it is simply amazing!!!!!!!!
<LI>It should be there for those who want to view it
<LI>There's nothing wrong with sex on the internet.  Sex is the ultimate act while the internet is the ultimate free speech medium they go hand in hand!
<LI>kunda
<LI>I think if that is what someone wants to look at, who am I to say they can not!
<LI>In Sweden, where I'm from, there are very few regulations about pornography. I think it should be that way on the net to. The Communication decency act stinks!!! It's just another proof of that wierd moral ruling America. America worries more about forbidding pornography on the net, than doing something about the fact that thousands of people get killed every year by handguns.
<LI>it should stay on the internet
<LI>It may honestly be the revolutionary way for sharing sex and intimacy without the adverse consequences of unwanted pregnancy and disease.  It also provides a media for the races to get together without prejudices of sight.
<LI>I think its okay if its not real accessible to children.  Adults have to take responsibility for their children.  If you cant keep it away from them than get rid of the net.
<LI>Its is wondeful - epecialy CUSeeme
<LI>It is on there enough for IF you want to find it, it's there... but if you have no desire, it stays out of your way.. it's how it should be.. censors are a bunch of crap trying to take away rights.
<LI>yum
<LI>We are sexual. Sex is good thing. Researchers have clearly demonstrated that children have sexual "urges." The concern is not sex, it's power-relationships and health in the context of sexual activity.
<LI>Would like to see more exciting stuff. :)
<LI>SEX
<LI>Need more of it
<LI>fantastic, glad we have coding +decoding devices for newsgroups
<LI>I enjoy having the opportunity to view sexually explicit material at my home!
<LI>Parents should be responsible for what their children see. Yet, some parents are not  caring parents and will not supervise their children, therefore, some type of regulations are needed.
<LI>we should have more access to everything!
<LI>It is a good thing!
<LI>Sex is great. The internet is great. I see no problum with them together.
<LI>I feel that it is there and should be.  It's just like any other information and should be available to those who chose to view it.

<H2><CENTER><I>How would you deal with the issue of regulating sexual/offensive content?</I></CENTER></H2>
<H5>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_SOL -->
<LI>Completely open to adults
<LI>easier monitoring for children
<LI>child pornography should be forbidden
<LI>the current practice of limiting access with age verification seems adequate if extended to all with erotic content
<LI>parental responsibility
<LI>Blow the suckas to hell
<LI>have parents have control of their children
<LI>Mind your OWN business, take care of your OWN kids, and don't negatively judge others, publically, for what YOU yourself do privately!  >:-(        ;o)
<LI>individuals should monitor content of materials, within their own computer....and limit access to minors....
<LI>America needs to grow up and realize that what is open to the puplic can help a national situation rectify it's self in such problems as rape and insest.
<LI>The Net SHOULD NOT BE REGULATED it is an adults duty to monitor their own and childrens access to the net.
<LI>promote use of adult-verification services and use secured pages with access denied to those without proof of legal age..
<LI>People should learn that if they dont want to look they shouldn't!
<LI>Monitoring system that notifies parents of child's activity
<LI>let it b
<LI>make it available only by free or paid subscription
<LI>make porn legal
<LI>be aware myself of what my child is involved in on the net
<LI>kill those people
<LI>I really feel like if you don't like what your looking at then mind somebody elses business.  There are many options to keep our children off of these sights.  And who are all of these people that think that they can decide what is moral for the world.  Last time I checked, even before the contrversy of the internet, the world was anything but moral.  What may be right for somebody is not always right for someone else.
<LI>Pay for view
<LI>If you dont like it dont go there(get cyber nany)
<LI>Parents must monitor their kids.
<LI>provide easy and honest means to block offensive material at the browser end
<LI>make ways for parents to censor what comes into their homes
<LI>Nuke the bastards
<LI>The Parents Should Check Their Kids Better
<LI>Existing laws should be applied to the net
<LI>encourage others to mind their own fucking business
<LI>Fuck the morality of the human race!!!  We want titties and butts!!!
<LI>Adults over 18 should have access to or post any sexual info or talk they want no restrictions
<LI>Parental Control should be more stronger in homes
<LI>fuck the gov.
<LI>keep the standards to where they should not be held liable and make it your choice to block certain sites for children.
<LI>Just as anti-racists cruise the 'net and directly attack racist web-sites via email, links and info proving the falseness of the extremists' claims, so could Internet sex warriors cruise the info highway providing warnings regarding really perverse stuff. by the way, I have seen really perverse stuff on the net - fisting, coprophilia (shit eating, for the less informed), kiddie porn, bestiliaty, the whole gamut. Most extreme porn filth is not located in sex websites but in "gross" sites such as alt. ta
teless. 
<LI>my advise is start drinking heavily
<LI>shag!!!
<LI>let it be like it is
<LI>Up to the discretion of the users
<LI>Continued use of sites such as "Cyber-Patrol" to restrict access by children - otherwise, a completly open net.
<LI>fuck censoring
<LI>let adult members of household take responsibility for controlling what minors have access to.
<LI>it should be left alone
<LI>before you get into the sight, have a little sign that says"17 or under prohibited"
<LI>rating system that can be blocked by adults if that is what thay CHOOSE.  complete availability should be available to all... those who are offended should just block it out of their own system
<LI>set up ways to have parents choose the amount of access their children have
<LI>parent's have the responsability for teaching and educating their own kids,  leave it to them
<LI>Provide ways for in family controls to be used.
<LI>I think you are sick and perverted you sickos.  PS I think you all should be fixed
<LI>ensure children are not viewing
<LI>FUCK ALL THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN FAVOR.
<LI>Parents should monitor their kids
<LI>In the privacy of one's home you have a right to view it
<LI>Let parents baby sit their own kids
<LI>Should not Censor the net
<LI>If you don't like it, don't look at it!!
<LI>If you don't like it, dont look at it!
<LI>let us see what we whant to see!!!!!
