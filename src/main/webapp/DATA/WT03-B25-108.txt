The Look of Chrome Without the Chrome</H1>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>Flexible Bright&#153; and Liquid Bright&#153; </B> were designed for use on exterior automobile components such as wheels, grilles, lighting assemblies and body side moldings. The products are said to improve the look and durability of automobile exteriors with quality materials that are flexible and have proven field performance. 

<P>The coatings give the appearance of a chrome finish but with certain advantages over chrome. Components can be made flexible, lightweight, corrosion resistant, recyclable and in a variety of two-tone and color finishes, depending upon 
specific products applications. 

<P>Flexible Bright&#153; is a proprietary process for depositing metal over a plastic surface. The resulting discontinuous layer and clear urethane topcoat provide a tough, resilient bright finish. 

<P>It survives five mph impact at -20F with no perceptible damage. Soft plastic applications can be folded nearly in half without cracking the metal surface. Since the metal is non-conductive, it does not corrode or delaminate, even if the surface is broken and subjected to salt spray. 

<P>Liquid Bright&#153; is a spin-off of Flexible Bright&#153;, created to extend its properties and chrome-like appearance to steel, aluminum and magnesium parts. The finish has completed physical part testing and exceeded performance specifications for CASS, filliform, thermal shock, simulated car wash, salt spray and Arizona Proving Ground.
