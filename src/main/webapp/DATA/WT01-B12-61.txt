 <IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> AGE </H2>
<P>Younger men are more likely to be affected than most people realize. Pre-cancerous lesions have been found in men who have died in accidents as young as 20 years of age. Over 25% of the men autopsied who have died in their 30's were found to be affected and over 55% of them in their 40's.</P>
<P>  Even though prostate cancer is slow growing, it is always better to have an early diagnosis.
   It is surprising that less than half of the men over the age of 40 have ever had the traditional digital exam that is recommended by both general practitioners and urologists. The lack of early diagnosis is one reason why as many as 60% of the cases that are diagnosed have already spread. The newer PSA Test (prostate specific antigen test) is a blood test that result in more cases being diagnosed sooner.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> THREE CATEGORIES</H2>
  <P>The prevalence of this condition is not well known. As a matter of fact, a survey has revealed that as many as 11% of American men were unaware that they even had a prostate gland.   Needless to say, the symptoms of prostate trouble are even  less well  known.   The conditions are usually categorized into one of three; 1) prostatitis (inflamed prostate), 2) benign prostatic hypertrophy (BHP), and 3) prostate cancer. Prostatitis is usually a result of an infection but quite often is thought to be caused by stress. Infections are usually treated with antibiotics  or  other  anti-infectives,  while  cases associated with stress are usually treated with muscle relaxants or exercise.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> BHP</H2>
<P>  In cases of BHP, the gland may grow many times its normal size, say from the size of a walnut, possibly in a young man in his 20's or early 30's, to as large as an orange or grapefruit in his 50's. Most researchers agree that this growth, at least in part, is associated with the male hormone testosterone or its metabolites. Although not malignant, BHP can be very uncomfortable as over growth of the prostate usually causes physical blockage of the urethra.  This results in urinary tract problems because the urethra, which carries urine from the bladder, travels through the middle of the prostate and can become blocked by the overgrowth of prostate tissue.  Also, bladder and kidney infections, as well as increased frequency of urination and discomfort, can result.</P>

<P>  Several different surgical techniques have been developed that remove all or some of the prostate tissue when used in the treatment of BHP and prostate cancer. Even though they can be life prolonging and go a long way to relieve pain and discomfort, they are not without their side effects and limitations.   More recently, the importance of diet and exercise has come to light.</P>

<IMG SRC="n32.gif" ALIGN=LEFT><H2> HIGH FAT DIETS</H2>
<P>  High fat diets have been linked to both BHP and prostate cancer. Autopsies have shown that cases of BHP have greatly increased the amount of cholesterol in their prostate tissues. It has also been shown that increasing body weight increases the incidence of prostate cancer. Moderately overweight men have more than double the risk, while those truly obese are four times more likely to develop the disease. Other studies have shown that men with prostate cancer consume more meat and dairy products. The incidence of prostate cancer goes up with decreased Vitamin A consumption and with increased exposure to Cadmium.</P>
<P>   Reduced activity and lack of exercise are also culprits in this whole scenario.  The Missouri Cancer Registry found that by studying 17,000 men with occupations that required a lot of physical activity had a lower incidence of prostate cancer.  In another study involving 18,000 men who burned 4,000 calories or more by weekly exercising reduced their risk of prostate cancer by up to over 85% when compared to men who used less than 1,000 calories by exercising per week.</P>
