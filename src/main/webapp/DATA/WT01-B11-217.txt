<B>Motel Strip Redevelopment Clears Hurdle
</B>
</CENTER><P>
The Ontario government has cleared the way for the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority to expropriate five properties along Etobicoke's motel strip.  The expropriation is a major component of the redevelopment project that will create a waterfront park.<P>

"This redevelopment plan was 25 years in the making," Mr. Hodgson said.  "It represents a unique blend of private and public interests, and it is good for Etobicoke and Metro.<P>

"This will create jobs and stimulate the economy," Mr. Hodgson said.<P>

The motel strip redevelopment plan includes private commercial and residential development, along with development by the conservation authority of a new waterfront park and roadway.<P>

"The park will link the Etobicoke Humber Bay parks to the western beaches in Toronto," said Mr. Hodgson. "It is also an important part of the stormwater management system that is necessary if the rest of the development in the area is to go ahead".<P>

The properties being expropriated will form part of the park.  The conservation authority has already negotiated agreements with other landowners, developers and public agencies for the rest of the land it needs.<P>
