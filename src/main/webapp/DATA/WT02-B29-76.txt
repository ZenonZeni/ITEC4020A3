Overview</STRONG></FONT><P>

New York Life Benefit Services, Inc. (NYLBS) offers to our clients a
comprehensive,
full-service  retirement
program called 401(k) Complete&reg;.  A quality,
all-inclusive
program, 401(k) Complete includes:
<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI><A HREF="#record">Recordkeeping and administration</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#benefit">Benefit consulting services</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#invest">Investment products</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#comm">Employee education and communication</A>
	<LI><A HREF="#tech">New technology</A></UL>
	
<P>
Supporting these products and services is NYLBS' unique foundation of
demonstrated experience
and time-tested financial strength.  Previously, as ADQ, Inc., and now
as
NYLBS, we have earned more
than 25 years' experience in employee benefits consulting and
recordkeeping. 
Now, as part of the New York
Life corporate family, we offer clients the tradition, stability and
financial
resources of our indirect parent
company, New York Life Insurance Company.  This combination of
experience and
stability has proven
itself  time and time again with the hundreds of qualified plans to
which
we now provide plan
services.
<P>
NYLBS has witnessed the
rapid
evolution of the benefits
industry and has seen employers grapple with great change.  Through
401(k)
Complete and our other benefit products and services, we can
offer our clients the
flexibility of a small company, the resources of a large one, the
experience of
an older firm and the
eagerness of a new one.
<P>


<STRONG>Our Business Philosophy</STRONG><BR>
Keeping abreast of changes in technology and investments means NYLBS
continually refines and
further
develops 401(k) Complete.  Yet our
adherence to three
simple tenets has remained unchanged:
<P>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Insistence on the highest quality possible in all elements of
the
program
	<LI>Constant effort to reduce the administrative burden of the
client's
personnel
	<LI>Continual pursuit of cost reduction strategies.
</UL>
<P>
This approach, combined with our ability to tailor and deliver a
program suited
for each client's
individual needs, enables us to play a crucial role in ensuring the
success of
our client's retirement and
benefit programs.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="record">Recordkeeping and
Administration</A></STRONG><BR>
NYLBS' success in recordkeeping stems from our two greatest
resources: 
personnel and
technology. 
Each client is assigned a team of professionals, including conversion,
administration and consulting
professionals, available to service each plan on a daily basis.  After
a
comprehensive needs
assessment, the appropriate individuals will begin a seamless
transition of
your plan onto PARTS&reg;, our
proprietary, daily valuation recordkeeping system.
<P>
PARTS uses state-of-the-art technology and is fully integrated with our
Trust
Operations System and
Benefits Complete, our Participant Service
Center/Voice
Response System service.  As owners of the system, we can quickly
incorporate program changes.  Data transfers within our single source
program
are instantaneous and
error-free, and the burden of conversion is shouldered by our
professionals,
not our clients.  The result
is reduction in client costs and administrative effort.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="benefit">Benefit Consulting Services</A></STRONG><BR>
NYLBS' long tradition of providing expert benefits consulting
distinguishes us from
typical
retirement plan providers.  Our consulting group includes highly
skilled, experienced
professionals
who specialize in defined contribution, defined benefit and health and
welfare programs. 
From
plan design to compliance to communications, the comprehensive nature
of our consulting
services,
delivered with the highest quality, provides our clients with a
value-added solution to their
benefit needs.
<P>


<STRONG><A NAME="invest">Investment Products</A></STRONG><BR>
Through 401(k) Complete, NYLBS can offer
our clients'
employees a complete spectrum of quality investment options, including
mutual
funds and guaranteed
investment contracts.  These diversified investment products, offered
through
NYLIFE Securities Inc. (member NASD),
feature The MainStay Funds (retail and institutional) and choices from
other
recognized fund families,
including Fidelity Advisor, Strong, Twentieth Century and Warburg
Pincus. From
conservative to aggressive funds, we recognize the importance of
managing risk
to seek consistency
of performance and desirable returns.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="comm">Employee Education and
Communication</A></STRONG><BR>
The Communications Group works actively with clients to implement
highly
effective programs
designed to educate and motivate participating and non-participating
employees. 
To complement
on-site enrollment meetings, our in-house Creative Agency has developed
a host
of high-energy
multimedia communications tools to encourage participation.  Our
communications
specialists and
consultants will help you select the most effective of these exciting
tools or
create a customized solution
for your plan.
<P>
<STRONG><A NAME="tech">New Technology</A></STRONG><BR>
The commitment and investment we have made to technology is evidenced
by the
state-of-the-art
features available to our clients and their employees.  Our Statement
on
Request&reg; feature makes
account statements available to participants at any time for any
reporting
period.  With Benefits
Complete&reg;, participants can access their
accounts through
a user-friendly voice response system for account inquiry, account
investment
changes and loan
administration.  Our goal is to ensure that our clients' management and
participants have the access
and information they need  when they need it.
