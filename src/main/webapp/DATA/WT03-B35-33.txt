IRAN STILL CONSIDERING ITS OPTIONS ON SHAKH DENIZ ROLE

(London)
Iran is still considering participating in Azerbaijan's Shakh Deniz oil and
gas project in the Caspian Sea, a senior Iranian oil official said last
week.
Mehdi Hosseini, the National Iranian Oil Co's exploration director, said in
a telephone interview from Tehran that Iran was still considering
Azerbaijan's invitation to join the project through an equity transfer from
state oil company Socar.
   Hosseini said the National Iranian Oil Co was "still looking at the
viability" of the project and that further exchanges of information with
Socar would be necessary. He said Socar had not imposed a deadline for
Iran's response to the long-standing invitation.
   Azerbaijan is anxious to compensate Iran for having been rejected as a
member of the consortium developing the offshore Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli
fields. Cash-strapped Socar plans to sell off part of its 40% stake in
Shakh Deniz, assigned in a preliminary agreement last summer with BP,
Statoil and Turkish TPAO which have a collective 60% equity. Negotiations
on a production- sharing agreement got underway late this year and will
resume in January 1996.
   Current thinking among the companies involved in Shakh Deniz is that
Iran could join the project, which currently has no US partners. But while
NIOC appears to be interested in Shakh Deniz, Iran's foreign ministry is
unwilling to endorse Iranian participation in an Azerbaijani offshore
project while the legal status of the Caspian remains unresolved, according
to analysts.
   Shakh Deniz's oil reserves are pegged at 1.2-1.4-bil bbl.
   Meanwhile, Hosseini said, French oil major Total will shortly begin
shooting seismic in the Sirri area offshore Iran. Hosseini said Total
already has begun a seabed survey using a vessel leased from NIOC. "Total
has started a seabed survey with this ship and will soon start seismic," he
said. "Drilling will be the next step," he added.
   Total in July signed a $600-mil contract to develop Iran's Sirri A and E
fields after Conoco of the US, which originally was awarded the contract,
was ordered by the US government to pull out of the deal.
   Total will be paid for its work with production from the project.
Hosseini said Total was working "in accordance with the time schedule."

UNOCAL SEEKS TO ADJUST THAI HOLDINGS
Wants to shift some stake to its partners

By:
Maya Webber

(Bangkok)
Unocal Thailand has asked its partners in several Gulf of Thailand contract
areas to increase their equity holdings, in a move to streamline gas price
negotiations by standardizing equity distribution in Unocal gas sales
contract areas I, II and III.
   Mitsui Oil Exploration Co currently controls 20% in Unocal I, 30% in
Unocal II, and 23.75% in Unocal III. If agreed to, the arrangement would
give Petroleum Authority of Thailand Exploration & Production Co a
first-time interest in Unocal I and II. PTTEP currently has a 5% interest
in Unocal II, but no interest in the other two contract areas.
   A Unocal spokesman in Thailand. said the negotiations do not reflect a
pullback by Unocal, which would remain the majority owner and operator of
the contract areas.
   "We were probing for a way to facilitate decision-making and cost
allocation among the three partners," said Konthi Kulachol, Unocal
Thailand's public relations manager, arguing that cost allocations can be
time-consuming and tedious.
   An increased interest by PTTEP could be attractive to Unocal in the
future. PTT, the monopoly operator of Thailand's natural gas pipelines,
retains a 70% interest in PTTEP.
   It makes sense to have "a close working relationship" with PTTEP, the
Unocal spokesman said.
   PTTEP officials said they have made no decisions about whether to invest
in Unocal I and II.
   Tevin Vongvanich, PTTEP vice-president for corporate planning and new
ventures, said that seeking to harmonize the equity holdings to reduce cost
allocation headaches is a good concept.
   Because the production potential of the areas is well proven, the
investment would involve little risk, he said. But that also means there
is limited added potential, he said. PTT's Natural Gas Business president
Prajya Phinyawat added that price would be a big factor in the decision to
take increased equity shares.
   Some of the fields are "quite old" and might start to decline, he said.
   Unocal Thailand's production from its offshore fields averaged 705,000
Mcf/d for the first nine months of 1995. Production is expected rise to
900,000-950,000 Mcf/d when a second pipeline to Rayong comes into service
next year. The company's investment in natural gas development in the gulf
represents the company's largest commitment for a single project. In
addition to Unocal I,II, and III, the company is also developing block
B12/27, the Pailin field.

AMOCO CANADA WILL SELL REMAINING CRESTAR STAKE

(Calgary)
Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. Ltd said it intends to sell its remaining 15%
stake in Crestar Energy Inc to fulfill a pledge to the federal government
following its C$5.2-bil takeover of Dome Petroleum Ltd in 1988.
   Calgary-based Amoco Canada said it has appointed RBC Dominion Securities
Inc as its agent to oversee block trades in Crestar.
   The planned transaction is valued at about C$134-mil ($98.4-mil) based
on Crestar's closing price Dec 28 of C$19.12 ($14.04) a share on the
Toronto Stock Exchange.
   Amoco Canada had promised to make certain assets available to Canadian
investors in the wake of its Dome acquisition. In 1993, the federal
government's screening agency for foreign investment allowed Amoco Canada
to spin off those assets to create Crestar.
   No date has been set to begin selling the 7-mil Crestar shares owned by
Amoco Canada, but the sale could start as early as Jan 4 under TSE
policies.
   Industry analysts have speculated that any proceeds from the Crestar
sale could be used by Amoco Canada to launch a significant takeover in
1996. Three months ago, Calgary-based Anderson Exploration Ltd's share
swap valued at C$800-mil beat out Amoco Canada's C$757-mil cash bid for
Home Oil Co Ltd
   Crestar is considered a promising player in Canada's oil patch. It
acquired Ranchmen's Resources Ltd. in a C$177.5-mil (C$130.4- mil) hostile
takeover effective Oct. 1.

NEB BACKING TCPL DEAL

(Calgary)
The National Energy Board has endorsed a historic four-year deal on
domestic and export natural gas transportation tolls negotiated by
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Canada's natural gas industry.
   The new tolls are designed to save millions of dollars a year in
transportation costs (ON 12/22).
   The incentive regulation agreement between the gas line operator and
shippers has been lauded as a watershed for new ways to cut the massive
costs of delivering most of Canada's gas to domestic and US markets.
   Normally, tolls are decided by the NEB, rather than between suppliers
and pipeline operators, said NEB secretary Scott Richardson. Final
endorsement of interim tolls that reflect the pipeline's terms of service
will be considered at a January hearing, Richardson said.
   Under the agreement--the first in North America signed with a pipeline
operator--when TransCanada saves C$1 in costs, the benefit will be split
50-50 between the Calgary-based pipeline and shippers.

VIETNAM TO CUT ITS TARIFFS

(Hanoi)
The country will cut the import tariff for petrol from 70% to 55% beginning
Jan 1, following a request from the the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations that all tariffs be brought under 60%, an official at the tax
department at the Ministry of Trade said. Vietnam imports all its products.
Tariffs on diesel will remain at 25% and for jet fuel at 10%, the official
said. The country is cutting tariffs on 857 goods or commodities from the
six members of ASEAN, the first step toward membership in the ASEAN Free
Trade Area, which Vietnam will join fully in 1996.

MARCUS HOOK SHUTDOWN DELAYED, AS THREE-WAY LABOR TALKS CONTINUING

(New York)
BP has pushed back into January the possible shutdown of the Marcus Hook,
Pennsylvania refinery, allowing more time for the union there to reach a
new contract with Tosco, which is buying BP's US Northeast refining and
marketing assets.
   BP had said it would begin to suspend operations at the 190,000 b/d
Marcus Hook plant at the start of January if it was unable to close the
deal with Tosco by the end of 1995. And BP had wanted Tosco to have a new
contract in place with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union at the
refinery before closing its deal with Tosco.
   BP now has delayed the potential shutdown until the middle of January, a
company spokesman said Dec 29. However, a union official said BP has
indicated in talks with OCAW that it would push back the suspension until
the end of the month. The BP spokeswoman had not comment on the union
official's statement. BP's current contract with the OCAW expires Jan 31.
   BP has extended the shutdown deadline to allow more time for the
company, as well as Tosco, to negotiate with the OCAW, the BP spokeswoman
said. BP still must settle severance issues with the union, while Tosco
must negotiate a new contract. The spokeswoman said severe winter weather
in the Philadelphia area has delayed negotiations. She also said BP is
encouraged by the meetings that began last week between Tosco and the OCAW.
A bargaining session was held Dec 29 between OCAW and Tosco, which wants to
cut refinery staff by 25% and runs by 20%. The BP spokeswoman said BP
still wants to close the Tosco sale as soon as possible. Should the company
suspend operations in January, it's likely that the sale to Tosco would
close in February, she said.

ELECTRICITY, TAXES TO BE STATES' '96 FOCUS
Power restructuring will be felt in the field

By:
William Mullins

(Houston)
The continuing shift in electricity markets in the US looms as a major
issue that oil industry officials will be watching at the state level in
1996, according to a survey of oil and gas officials in several key
states.
   An overview of some of the leading state issues facing the industry this
year indicates that on the state level, the oil industry as electricity
consumer, rather than as provider of a generating fuel, has risen to the
top of the list of concerns in several states.
   Ironically, the second-biggest state in terms of oil production--
Texas--will not have a legislative session this year, so no issues will be
decided there.
   What follows is a state-by-state survey of some of the leading issues
that will be taken up by legislatures this year.
CALIFORNIA: The ongoing restructuring of electricity markets in the state
is an important issue to oil producers because they have a constant base
load demand and use a lot of electricity, said California Independent
Petroleum Assn president Dan Kramer.
   "So, as a group we'll be fighting potentially having to pay excessive
stranded costs, basically paying for utilities' bad investments in nuclear
power and some other more expensive forms of power that would be embedded
in our electricity rates," Kramer said. "We'll be fighting that issue along
with trying to lower electricity rates for our producers in general."
   Electricity bills in California, depending on where a company is
located, are 25% to 50% higher than in any other state, he said.
   Oil companies have formed a group called Oil Producers Electric Project,
and are working on a legislative solution to the problem.
   As for other issues in the nation's largest state, California doesn't
have a severance tax on oil production, and some of the more liberal
legislators probably will introduce a severance tax bill on the grounds
that other large producing states have such a tax, Kramer said. But oil
producers will be opposing it, Kramer said, basing its opposition in part
on the argument that California already has the highest property taxes on
oil production of any state that imposes such levies.
   The industry also will try again to reform the California endangered
species act, which is more stringent than the federal law, he said. A bill
almost was passed at the end of the last session but it failed because of
disagreements on a few issues, Kramer said.
   Still another industry goal is to repeal a portion of state fish and
game laws that allow the California Dept of Fish & Game, in conjunction
with local district attorneys, city attorneys and environmental groups, to
levy bounty hunter fines on producers with accidental spills, he said.
These are small accidental spills that can be less than one barrel, but
carry fines of up to $25,000 per day. Kramer said they have been levied on
a producer, even if it cleans up the spill.
   "We'll also attempt to coordinate oil spill response," he said. "In
California, when you have an oil spill, depending on where you're at, you
can have up to 15 or 16 different agencies involved in the spill and
they're all trying to assert their jurisdictional authority."
LOUISIANA: The legislature will be holding a session on fiscal matters
only, but the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Assn thinks one issue that
could come up is the idea of an oil and gas processing tax designed to
raise revenue on the foreign oil imported into Louisiana, as well as the
offshore oil and gas coming into the state. Such a proposal has been
defeated previously and probably would be again, an association spokesman
noted.
OKLAHOMA: Oklahoma oil producers, like those in California, are hoping to
see the legislature enact some kind of electricity rate reform, said Mickey
Thompson, executive vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum
Assn.
   Oklahoma producers also will be fighting against two proposals that
would modify forced pooling arrangements, and allow higher damages to be
assessed in pollution cases, Thompson said.
   The forced pooling issue arises from a law allowing the state to step in
where there are multiple land owners on a tract, and an operator can't
reach negotiated settlements with all of them. The state can "force pool"
the properties in such circumstances.
   Royalty owners and producers are on opposite sides, with royalty owners
maintaining some operators are abusing the process by using it as a quick
way of putting together a tract without bothering to negotiate, according
to Jim Stafford, executive director of the National Assn of Royalty Owners.
"The poolings in Oklahoma in the last few years have gotten ridiculous in
terms of being vastly unfair in regards to fair market value, on lease
bonuses particularly," he said.
   Another factor is that royalty owners are concerned about a producer
acquiring multiple zones on a lease tract, but not drilling, testing and
producing all of them, Thompson said. This can occur when the producer
can't or doesn't want to produce from more than one zone and may later
produce the others, but some royalty owners would like to see a time frame
within which a producer had to produce the zones or lose his rights.
   Producers and royalty owners are having difficulty coming to an
agreement over the issue, Thompson said. So the situation may develop as it
did last year, when the royalty owners found a sponsor for their bill, but
couldn't prevail in voting on the measure.
   Another proposal supported by royalty owners and farm and ranch
organizations would change the Oklahoma law on how much damages courts can
award in pollution cases, Thompson said. The proposal follows a state
Supreme Court decision in 1994 that held a land owner could recover no more
than the total value of the land in a pollution case, although the Oklahoma
Corporation Commission still would be able to compel an operator to clean
up the pollution.
   The initial bill to negate the effect of the Supreme Court ruling
failed, but the oil industry expects a similar bill will be introduced in
next year's session, he said.
   Another issue which probably can't be handled in one session but which
the industry wants to pursue is the creation of a state oil and gas
department that would take over regulation from the Oklahoma Corporation
Commission, Thompson said.
KANSAS: A major tax shift bill that passed the House last year is in the
Senate tax committee now, said Donald Schnacke, executive vice president of
the Kansas Independent Oil & Gas Assn. The bill would shift about $600-mil
in annual school levies from overall property taxes to the sales and
individual income tax base.
   "We pay a significant property tax on oil leases, about $100-mil a
year," Schnacke said. "This bill, if it passed, would reduce our ad valorem
tax by about 50%. That would be a very significant improvement on our tax
situation. The governor is resisting this bill, but it's a very popular
bill and he may wind up having to veto it."
   There also is likely to be action on the issue of abandoned wells,
Schnacke said. The Kansas Corporation Commission has estimated there may be
as many as 91,000 such wells throughout the state, but they date from 1880
and regulation only started in 1935. "We're probably talking about using
dedicated severance tax money or something like that to help on the expense
of this well plugging," Schnake said.
COLORADO: The state's severance tax is likely to come up in the 1996
session of the Colorado legislature, according to the Rocky Mountain Oil &
Gas Assn. At present, 50% of the tax is allocated for local governments to
use in addressing impacts from mineral development, and the other 50% goes
into a state trust account.
   But an amendment is expected to be offered that would allow half the
state trust funds to be used for state agency projects directly related to
mineral development.
   Another proposal that the Colorado legislature is expected to consider
is a bill on retail wheeling, which would allow retail customers to freely
choose among different suppliers of electricity. The oil industry's
interest is both as a user of electricity and as a supplier of natural gas
to fire power plants.
NEW MEXICO: In a budget-only session, there might be a revival of a
proposal to impose a pipeline tax that would raise $10- or $15-mil for the
state, said D. Van De Graaff, executive vice president of the New Mexico
Oil & Gas Assn. The proposal previously passed the Senate, but was defeated
in the lower chamber.
OTHER STATES: The Idaho legislature will consider raising the state's motor
fuels tax 2-5 cts/gal to pay for road maintenance and construction, while
South Dakota will be looking at an increase of 3cts/gal dedicated to county
roads and bridges.
   Utah's legislature also is being urged by government agencies to
increase the state motor fuel tax to fund road work.

PETRODOLLARS

By:
Peter Zipf

Who would have thought that old war horses like Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and
the like could still put on such a strong finishing kick? The group of the
largest publicly traded oil majors ended 1995 with an impressive
performance in equity markets. In the last two months of 1995, a group of
14 large oil companies posted a stock- price gain of 11%, bettering the 5%
increase in the Standard & Poor's 500. Most of the majors clearly needed
this late run to the wire, since for much of the year they badly lagged the
stellar 34% gain posted by the S&P 500 for the full year. Even with the
late jump, the 14-member oil group's full-year gain was 24%.
   The oil group did have its stars for the full year, with Exxon (up 37%),
Mobil (+35%) and the smaller Kerr-McGee (+35%) managing to beat by a nose
the gain of the S&P 500. Also in this top-tier group, though trailing the
broader market by a length, were Royal Dutch/Shell (+30%), Texaco (+30%)
and BP (+29%). Further back in the pack in 1995 were Shell Transport &
Trading (+24%), Amoco (+22%), Chevron (+18%), Amerada Hess (+18%) and
Marathon (+17%). Trailing badly were Arco (+9%), Unocal (+7%) and Phillips
(+4%).
   To some industry analysts, the story of 1995 was this divergence in the
stock-price performance of the largest oil companies. Their conclusion: it
paid to be big and well-balanced internationally. As an example, Dean
Witter's Eugene Nowak cites Mobil, whose diversity allowed it to use
stronger margins in Singapore to offset weak refining margins for parts of
the year in the US and Europe. The more US-concentrated majors, such as
Arco, Unocal and Phillips, also suffered because of their higher leverage
to domestic natural gas prices, which had a disappointing year.
   The largest companies also attracted more market attention, Schroder
Wertheim's Michael Mayer says, because they tend to raise their dividends
year after year, providing a haven for yield-starved investors.
   The diversity of the biggest oil companies also provided some insulation
as oil prices languished for much of the year, a development that set back
the domestic majors.
   If geographic and sector balance was a key to equity performance in
1995, why was Kerr-McGee among the leaders? Nowak says the company's exit
from the US downstream in 1995 exceeded expectations, with Kerr-McGee
planning to use the $400-mil in proceeds to reduce debt and repurchase
stock. Nowak calls Kerr- McGee his favorite gas play, and sees the stock
gaining more than 10% in the next 12 months.
   The oil group's late kick allowed it to make up some ground on the
overall market. Mayer says many major portfolios were underweighted on oil
stocks during much of 1995, in large part due to OPEC-induced uncertainty
on the direction of oil prices. Once OPEC's mid-November meeting removed
much of the haze--the organization decided to roll over its output ceiling
for another six months--the fund managers began to pour money into the big
oils. The money that rotated into oil was drawn from previously hot stock
groups such as technology and the financials.
   Adding to the impact of firmer oil prices was the surge in US natural
gas prices, which Mayer calls "the icing on the cake."

Bear Stearns Fred Leuffer said the end-year trading rally proves that
investors' "thirst for yield is insatiable," with fund money being drawn by
the relatively strong dividends paid by many large oil companies.
   How will the race in 1996 infold? Many observers do not expect it to be
as enticing as this year's run. "The easy money has been made," says Nowak.
The international majors traditionally have been good values, he says, but
that margin has been narrowed by this year's late run.
   Leuffer is advising investors to trim positions in the major oils now
that a rally has taken place. He says his neutral outlook for the group for
1996 would likely slide to "sell" if not for the yield protection the oil
companies provide.
   Leuffer believes the majors' earnings momentum has peaked. After rising
35% in 1995, the analyst expects operating earnings for the group to
increase only 6% in 1996. Some of this is tied to the fact that
restructurings, and their associated cost cuts, having largely run their
course at most companies.
   Many analysts continue to like Mobil despite its 35% gain in 1995. Mayer
ranks the company as a premier E&P player, saying Mobil invests about
two-thirds of its cash flow on the upstream-- as opposed to the industry
norm of some 85%--yet more than replaces output each year. Mobil is also
seen deriving further savings from its broad restructuring, and is among a
group of 5-7 majors likely to boost dividends in 1996. This yield
protection is shaping up as a key factor in the group's projected
performance for 1996. For an investor in a defensive posture, "the oils are
a decent place to have holdings," Leuffer says.
