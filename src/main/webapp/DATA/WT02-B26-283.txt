<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>The Story</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

On an ordinary Wednesday morning in October 1994 Bert Brockhouse
gets out of bed at his usual time--about 6:45. He stretches a bit
to loosen the overnight aches of his 76-year-old body when he sees
the little red light blinking on the answering machine on the FAX line.

<P>
Who could have called in the middle of the night, he thinks, as he
goes over to press the play button. He listens to a voice announcing
itself from Stockholm saying, "B. N. Brockhouse and C. G. Shull have
been selected as recipients of the 1994 Nobel prize for physics."
Brockhouse is stunned. For a moment he thinks, "Oh that's interesting,"
but then he realizes, "I AM B. N. Brockhouse," and he calls his wife
Dorrie, to listen the tape again with him.
<P>

The rest of the day is filled with phone calls, telegrams and interviews.
The next year, one of travel, awards, banquets, and lectures. In short 
Brockhouse had come out of retirement. In his annual Christmas 
letter to friends that year, after describing all the
festivities in Stockholm, Brockhouse says, "If anyone cares,
we got a new car in the Summer, a Chrysler Neon."
<P>

Brockhouse's Nobel prize can be traced back to 1951. Fresh out of
the University of Toronto with a PhD in Physics, Brockhouse sat
at his desk in a faded blue-shingled wartime
hut at Chalk River, Ontario, home of Canada's Atomic Energy
Project for the National Research Council.
 
<P>
He gazed out the window at the snow. It was Winter, but he
felt warm inside the hut. He just sat there thinking, mulling
things over in his mind. The other night he had been at
his boss's house, Donald Hurst, head of the Neutron Spectrometer
section. They had been reading a 1944 paper about neutrons--
subatomic particles with no electric charge that, together with
protons made up the nucleus of an atom. The existence of neutrons
had only been verified about 20 years before. Not much was
known about them. Brockhouse didn't quite understand the theories
in the paper, but he felt it had a lot of interesting ideas.
He was supposed to be working on something else, but couldn't 
stop thinking about the concepts in the paper and how he
could do experiments at Chalk River to try out some of the new
theories in the laboratory.
<P>

He fiddled with some math on his notepad for a while and then
went to the coffee room. As he passed the lab that housed
the radioactive nuclear pile, one of the most powerful sources
of neutrons in the world at the time, he wondered how he
could use the tools at hand, or if he'd have to make new tools.
In the coffee room he met Hurst. Brockhouse went up to the 
blackboard and said, "Don there's something I'd like to show
you." He sketched out some equations on the blackboard.
The math described a device they could
build that would use a neutron beam as a kind of flashlight
that could look into the mysteries of crystalline structures
and other solids. Metals, minerals, gems, and rocks.
<P>

Brockhouse went on to solve problems of controlling the source
of the neutron beam; limiting it to neutrons of only one energy;
eliminating background radiation from other experiments in the
lab; and problems with the sensitivity of the detectors.
The resulting Triple-Axis Neutron Spectrometer is now used 
worldwide to investigate crystal structures.
<P>

<P>

<B>History</B><BR>

Bert Brockhouse was born in Lethbridge, Alberta in 1918, but in the 1920s
the family moved to Vancouver. They operated a rooming house
in Vancouver's West End. Bert had a paper route to help supplement
the family income. He liked fishing and went with
his buddies to catch cod and salmon off the pier at English Bay. He
fooled around with radios a lot, hanging out at radio repair shops and
making home-made radios from designs in popular electronics
magazines. After high-school, instead of going to University,
Brockhouse worked as a radio repair man. Then World War II came along
and his radio skills came in handy as an electronics technician in
the Canadian Naval Reserve. 
<P>

Brockhouse went to the University of British
Columbia after the war, majored in Math and Physics, getting
a BSc with honours (1947). He then did his PhD at the University
of Toronto (1950), moving to Chalk River shortly afterwards.
Brockhouse spent his working life as a researcher at Chalk River
perfecting neutron spectroscopes and their applications. 
Regarding his current work, 
he speaks cryptically of "The Grand Atlas", a sort of rulebook
for nature incorporating theories both physical and metaphysical.

Brockhouse is an experimentalist in the Physics of Solids like metals
and crystals. It's called Solid State Physics. As his tool he uses a
Neutron Spectrometer that he developed at Chalk River.
<P>

According to Brockhouse, the virtue of neutrons is you can say a great
deal about a material by using a neutron beam. Imagine shining the beam
of a flashlight on an object. Your concept of that object is based on
the light reflected from it. But when the object gets down to the
atomic level, the light from the flashlight's beam is "too big". The
wavelength (or energy) of ordinary light is about 7000 Angstroms (one
Angstrom is the width of a hydrogen nucleus), while the wavelength of a
neutron beam is around 1 - 4 Angstroms. In other words, your beam of
neutron "light" can penetrate to see details thousands of times
finer.

1. The original triple axis spectrometer (1959). The bank of 52 rotary
switches in the upper centre of the picture could be preset to go
through an energy scan of up to 26 points. A feature of Brockhouse's
spectrometer was the way you could vary three angles: the direction of
the neutron beam, the position of the specimen, and the angle of the
detector. Add to this the ability to vary the energy of the incoming
neutrons and the sensitivity of the detector and you have a Nobel prize
winning creation. (Photo, courtesy of AECL)

<P>

2. Monochromating Crystal. A special crystal of salt (NaCl) was used to
separate out neutrons of a particular energy. The beam was then aimed
and collimated (straightened out) before being sent on to the target.

<P>

3. Specimen. The position of the target metal or crystal can be varied
on two axes. The beam of neutrons bounces off the target in different 
directions that can tell us something about the atomic structure of the
material if we can detect them.

<P>

4. Detector. Another crystal, similar to the monochromating crystal,
can be tuned to pick up particular energies which are then passed on
to the detector which counts incoming neutrons.

<FONT SIZE="+2"><I><TD><B>Activity</I></B></FONT>

<HR NOSHADE>

Objective:<P>

<UL>

<LI> To set up a crude spectrometer


</UL>


You'll Need:<P>

<UL>

<LI> A laser light source (preferred), or flashlight/penlight.

<LI> A crystal like quartz or amethyst

<LI> A dark box

<LI> Optional frequency detector to measure shift in light frequency.



</UL>

What to do:<P>

<DL>

<DT>

<DD>     

Inside the box, set up the laser light source and the target 
crystal. By rotating the crystal and measuring the angles
of refraction of the light beam, you can infer things about
the internal crystalline structure of the material.

<P>

If you have a frequency detector, you can measure shifts in
light frequency before and after passing through the target.
Theoretically this represents a change in the energy of the 
light which can tell you other things about the material.

<HR NOSHADE>

Like many physicists, Bert Brockhouse likes to explore metaphysical
ideas as well--the spirit world. He is a religious man. His belief in physics 
theory coexists with his belief in religion. "Science
is an act of faith," he says. Without faith, how can understanding
the existence of a neutron help with the larger moral issues in life?
<P>

Brockhouse's example of a moral problem is "Kantian Doom" -- 
the idea that we are doomed because even though we
know that something is bad for us, we do it anyway because
everyone else is doing it. Examples might be driving cars, using 
computers, or watching television. Brockhouse would like to see
a solution to this social problem.
