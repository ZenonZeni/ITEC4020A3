<h2><font color="#FF6666">Solve Chemical Problems Faster Than Ever</font></h2>

For extremely high-throughput sites, a GEMINI 2000  spectrometer offers automated 
capabilities which redefine the concept of NMR automation. <P>


<h3><font color="#FF6666">Intelligent Automation</font></h3>

Varian's exclusive MAGICAL&#153; II (MAGnetics Instrument Control and Analysis Language) 
macro language delivers the most intelligent NMR automation available.  It combines 
all VNMR commands with high-level language features, such as IF statements and loops, 
and provides access to parameters and key features of the data, such as integrals 
and frequencies.  A customizable, menu-driven program for automation allows up to 
100 randomly accessed samples to be queued. After selecting the sample location, 
experiment, and solvent, processing and plotting automatically starts before the 
next sample is even in the magnet.  Users can change the priority of samples 
and interrupt an automation run without having to re-program the remaining samples.<P>

<h3><font color="#FF6666">Fast Sample Handling for High-throughput Sites</font></h3>

The Sample Management System (SMS) autosampler delivers fast, reliable 
sample handling for both walk-up and quality control facilities. Its 
30-second sample change time dramatically improves productivity, and for 
1D proton or fluorine analyses which take four minutes or less, it can 
provide up to 25% higher throughput than conventional NMR autosamplers. <P>

 use of resources by allowing unattended operation.</font> </center><P>

Developed in partnership with <A HREF="http://www.zymark.com">Zymark Corporation</A>, the SMS autosampler 
uses state-of-the-art robotics including self-calibration and a 
tactile-sensing gripper. Optically-encoded potentiometers ensure 
long-term positional accuracy, while voltage feedback circuitry 
verifies robotic functions for maximum reliability.  The SMS 
autosampler can be configured with easy-to-remove 50- or 100-sample 
racks, accommodating either 5- or 10-mm NMR tubes. For polymer 
analyses, modified trays are available for sample heating before 
introduction to the magnet.

The versatility and expandability of the Sample Management 
System ensure a viable upgrade path for evolving sample handling needs.<P>
