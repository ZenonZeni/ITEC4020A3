<h3>Family Planning Focus Group </h3>
There were 10 Russian women participants and two Russian facilitators and two American leaders. The participants average age was 23. There were two women who had one child each, and the others had no children. The forty questions were basically concerned with availability of knowledge and resources for family planning.<p> 

The women who had not had children wanted at least two children each, but this was in direct contrast to the women with one child, who were very reluctant to consider having another. The realities of work and family life had taken its toll. There was no systematic, reliable information source for family planning. This phenomena was across the board the continual, central crisis for the fertile Russian female. The rhythm method remains the method of "choice" (a euphemism since they feel there is so little choice). The pill has a negative history with heavy doses bringing many side effects, and relayed messages of negative perceptions being widespread. IUD's are being used now only by the women who have had one child. They are not too expensive and readily available in the drugstores; this usage helps to explain the "one child" syndrome that is now the norm (current Russian statistics show a negative birth rate). <p> 

The women feel that the medical profession is also lacking in the information and lacking access to family planning resources. The District Medical Centers are particularly noninformative and even hostile to women's questions about gynocological care and contraception. The women report that the women doctors are actually the worst with their responsiveness to the female questions. (This probably is a defensive response because the doctors themselves are uninformed or uneducated in these matters). They prefer male doctors who seem to have more empathy and helpful caringness. <p> 

These women find there is little knowledge about STDS's and AIDS. Another critical, central issue is that these women report they only visit a doctor when there is a problem. Prevention is not a known concept. The women actually hate going to a doctor. The wait is long and the attitude usually intolerable. Only recently with the avrailability of private doctors do the women feel that their health is receiving proper attention and they can trust the doctor. The sense of choice, which is entirely new in this country, is allowing them some freedom to ask more questions and pursue more avenues of alternative care. But the major obstacles of education and resources in this area as well as the overriding taboo (seen as weird or weak) against Russian women going to a doctor for their female problems loom continuously in the face of women's health care. <p> 


<h3>Menopause/Midlife</h3>

This group had 7 Russian participants. The average age was 36 and only two of the women did not have children. The focus of the group was to discuss their knowledge of menopause: its effects and treatrnent. The women reported that their knowledge was all second hand from their mothers experiences. Most of them reported that their mothers had had a difficult time. But they did not seek help until in extreme dire strates. There is no knowledge available nor is this problem discussed with the Russian doctors. They were unaware of any treatment for menopause; and they feel this is something one has to sove for herself. They prefer not to think about it until it happens. Then if problems develop, possibly see a doctor or psychologist. But once again, the doctors at the district medical centers are uncomfortable and not helpful with these issues. This is not considered a serious problem and the female is looked at strangely if she asks for family planning care. This is even worse in the smaller cities and towns. Now some help of this kind might be available to the women who have money who can go to private doctors. Only a few said they would discuss it with their husbands, because most men do not want to hear about female problems. Also, employers are agitated if women complain about feminine problems, so they only talk with other women co-workers about the problems. One should not miss work or do less on the job if having side effects. There was a general feeling that women can overcome on their own. They have not trusted the system. Many report the incompetence of their doctors, who are not held personally responsible. They told stories of wrong diagnosis across the board. The issue of money is paramount, because the medical centers are free and the specialist and private centers are expensive. But they all welcome the revamping of the medical system wherein they can now change doctors (part of the new capitalistic influence nationwide). These women are eager to know more about help and are in midlife and are anxious for all publications to be printed in Russian. <p> 

<h3>Physicians Attitudes and Knowledge: Family Planning and Menopause/Midlife</h3>

There were six Russian participants, all were working as doctors at the medical institute. The average age was 29, and three of the doctors also had Ph.D.'s. There was an opening question of why we were there training and collaborating. We discussed what the problems were in women's healthcare today. Definitely, these female doctors were cognizant of the lack of knowledge and care for female issues in the medical arena. The education of the whole population is very poor or nonexistent in sexual matters, in family planning and in female gynecological issues. Women seem afraid of negative consequences for help in health or family planning. Their mothers have been skeptical and they don't have time to think about their health. The life of the Russian woman is tedious and complicated with difficulties economically and time crunches. The Russian women are more tired than the American women. Now you have 5 years to stay at home with a child and your job is reserved, but most women cannot afford to do this. There is a small, but growing group of housewives of businessmen who are electing to stay at home now. The problem of time and energy is overwhelming, and the women are crying for more flex time. Waiting in line for over an hour is an oppressive obstacle when one goes to the doctor because they do not have specific appointment times. Because of these time elements as well as societal taboos, illnesses are ignored in the first stages, so when the patients appear for help, they are usually in the more advanced stages. The doctors that are educated appreciate an informed, inquiring patient. But those not well educated, they are irritated with the patient and give misleading information about treatments. The problem with contraception is that the women will not return for pill evaluations, the condoms are not good and the IUD's are given only to the women with a child. Abortion is the last resort, but most Russian women resort to this method. The Russian women need personal doctors where they are followed for all of her life stages. Also, the doctors need to spend more time with their patients, educating them as well as providing treatment. Doctors need more autonomy so they can be in charge of their schedule and how they spend time with their patients. There are some doctors in the workplace but they are not gynecologists.<p>   

They asked for more information, because they lack current medical journals. The need for hard currency reigns supreme. (The cost of  an IUD is $10 for the first consultation and $15 to put it in. The cost of an abortion is $30 with an average starting salary of $25 a month.) They complained of primitive equipment and lack of pictures and pamphlets to educate themselves much less their patients. They asked for training in communication, in family relationship and sexuality and sexual pathology. They would welcome any psychology courses in women's issues.<p>
