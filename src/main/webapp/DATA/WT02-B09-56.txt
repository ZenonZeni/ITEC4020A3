<h2 ALIGN=center>Work Out Your Wintertime Blues</h2>


When old man winter blows into town, will you stay inside or will you venture outside and continue your outdoor workout as usual? 


Cold weather doesn't have to mean an end to outdoor exercising. Many people find running, cycling, skiing, or walking outdoors in the winter a good way to avoid the wintertime blues. To continue exercising outside, simply make allowances for the weather and adjust your workout appropriately. <p>


<BR>





Here are suggestions to help you continue to have an exhilarating outdoor workout, despite the cold:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Warm up inside. Jog in place and stretch all of your major muscle groups inside before going outside.<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Drink plenty of fluids. In colder weather, your body has the added responsibility of warming and moistening the cold air you breathe. Drink water before, during and after your workouts. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks since both can dehydrate your body. Alcohol may also give a false sense of warmth. <BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Withstand the wind chill. The wind chill can drop temperatures drastically. To lessen the wind's effect, move against it at the beginning of your workout and keep it behind you as you finish your workout. This allows you to get the worst over at the onset before you become tired.<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Be reflective. In the winter, daylight hours are shorter and vision ranges are distorted by weather conditions. Wear reflective clothing that will stand out against your surroundings.<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Move constantly. If you have to stop exercising while outside, put on extra clothing before you get cold. Try to stay in constant motion while you're outside in the winter cold.<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Be cautious. Exercising on snow or ice isn't worth risking your health. If you exercise through snow, slow your pace and wear shoes with good traction. Avoid exercising on wet ice or snow. Exercise indoors if weather conditions are extremely harsh.<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Protect your skin and sight. Wear sunglasses and sunscreen when outside. Snow cover reflects sunlight which burns skin quickly and can hinder your vision.<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Cool down inside. Jog in place and stretch your major muscle groups once inside again to cool down.


</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Suit Up for Safe Winter Exercising</h2>





Journeying out for a jog in cold weather takes preparation to keep yourself warm. When preparing for outdoor exercise, consider the following tips:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Layer your clothes. The first layer should remove perspiration, the second layer should supply warmth, and the third layer should protect against wind and rain.<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Wear jackets with zippers so you can unzip them when you begin to sweat or remove them as you warm up.<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Wear thin socks that repel water away from your feet underneath thick wool socks for warmth.<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Stay on your feet. Choose shoes that have good traction and shock absorption for the surface you'll be exercising on. Wear shoes big enough to fit an extra pair of socks in without cramping your feet.<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Cover your head. Most of the heat your body loses escapes through your head. Wear a cap, hat, hood, ski mask, or scarf to prevent heat loss.<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Wear either mittens or gloves to warm your hands. Make sure your choice is waterproof.


</ul>
