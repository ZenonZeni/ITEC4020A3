<h4>Draft Sweeteners in Food (Amendment) Regulations 1997</h4>

Following the adoption of an amendment to the EC Directive 94/35 on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs, MAFF have issued a proposal for an amending Regulation which would implement the requirements of the amending Directive.  It was adopted by the Council on 9/10 December but has not yet been published in the OJ.  However MAFF wishes to amend the UK Regulations as rapidly as possible and is therefore pressing ahead with formal consultation.
<p>
The Regulations take into account recent technical developments in the sweeteners market by extending the use of sweeteners already permitted to certain additional categories of food.  Certain technical provisions are also added to bring the controls more into line with the controls on colours and miscellaneous additives.  They also have replaced the food category “<i>vitamins and dietary preparations</i>” by the title: “<i>Food supplement/diet integrators based on vitamins and/or mineral elements, syrup-type or chewable</i>” which, state MAFF will reflect more closely the needs of the market.
<p>
The Guidance Notes produced by MAFF will also be revised to take account of the changes and a draft will be circulated.
<p>
MAFF have requested comments on the draft regulations by 28 February 1997.

<h4>Scottish Outbreak of E. coli 0157: Statement by the Secretary of State for Scotland House of Commons - on the "Interim Report and Priority Recommendations" made by the "Pennington Group"</h4>

The following is an extract from the Statement made in the House of Commons on 15 January 1997.  The Pennington Group (Chaired by Professor Pennington) is conducting a review of various issues following the outbreak of E. coli 0157 in Scotland which has resulted in 17 deaths (as at 16.1.97).  They have published an Interim report.  The following extract from the statement is that part which relates directly to the legislative provisions.  The whole <A HREF="http://www.open.gov.uk/scotoff/penstat.htm">statement</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.open.gov.uk/scotoff/penrec.htm">Interim Report</A> are available on the Scottish Office WWW pages.
<p>
"<i>On enforcement, Professor Pennington makes several recommendations. 
<p>
Existing arrangements on food hygiene are based on EU Directives, brought into force by Regulations under the Food Safety Act 1990.  The Codes of Practice under the Act were widely consulted upon and laid before this House. 
<p>
Professor Pennington recommends urgent consideration of the legislation and action through licensing to ensure that equivalent standards of hygiene apply to premises principally selling to the final consumer as to those premises subject to the Meat Products (Hygiene) Regulations. He also recommends urgent action to ensure the physical separation of raw and cooked meat products using separate counters, refrigerated equipment and separate staff. Pending the outcome of consideration of the legislation he recommends that the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food should be asked to review its guidance on cross contamination. I have asked them to do so. 
<p>
These recommendations have far reaching implications. I have instructed my officials to examine the practical implications of these recommendations and in doing so to consult consumers, health professionals, environmental health officers, processors and retailers. It would be helpful to Professor Pennington to have more detailed information on the practical aspects. With this in mind, I have therefore asked the Meat and Livestock Commission - the Government's statutory advisers on the industry - to carry out an urgent study of these issues, so that Professor Pennington can take this into account in his final report. 
<p>
Professor Pennington makes three recommendations in respect of the Codes of Practice under the Food Safety Act 1990, all of which my colleagues and I are accepting. First they recommend a review of Code of Practice 16 which relates to the Food Hazard Warning System. This system, operated by the Government, is to warn Environmental Health Departments of possible or actual food hazards on the basis of information from other areas. Professor Pennington concludes that the difficulty here for the food authority is setting the balance between dealing with routine matters at local level, and advising central Government of emerging problems. As Code of Practice 16 is presently written, the decision to notify central Government is a judgement made locally. He suggests it may be better to define an 'isolated incident' as one which is contained within the boundaries of the food authority. It should however be incumbent upon that authority to notify central Government the moment they have evidence that food distribution is beyond the local authority boundary. It would also be essential to retain the 'major local incident' provision so that central Government is informed immediately even if the problem is contained within the authority's area, but involves a significant number of people; or an organism such as E.coli 0157 or a problem such as botulism is involved. 
<p>
Allied to this is a recommendation that the code should place greater emphasis on risk and the assessment of all factors relevant to the protection of public health. This key addition would cover such matters as the virulence of the organism, the extent of distribution of the food, the vulnerability of the consumer group and the confidence which could be attached to product recall. The revision would make clear that careful assessment of the risk involved is fundamental to informing decisions on the ground. 
<p>
Professor Pennington also recommends a review of Code of Practice No.9 which relates to food hygiene inspections, to ensure better targeting of resources on high risk premises. 
<p>
I accept all of these recommendations. Good lines of communication from local to central Government and timely release by local outbreak control teams of information to the public are crucial, as the paramount consideration must always be the protection of public health. Similarly I agree that there should be careful targeting of resources on the high risk premises. This guidance for enforcement officers will be reflected in the revised Codes of Practice which will go out to consultation shortly. 
<p>
Professor Pennington makes observations on the potential for cross-contamination in slaughterhouses focusing specifically on the slaughtering of cattle in a clean condition. My Department is pursuing this issue with the Meat Hygiene Service who are well advanced in preparing practical guidance on the definition of acceptable standards of cleanliness in animals presented for slaughter. 
<p>
Hazard Analysis improves food safety by focusing on critical points in the preparation and handling of food. Professor Pennington therefore recommends that the implementation of these requirements be accelerated particularly for high risk premises which handle raw and cooked foods. I agree. My Department will urge Environmental Health Departments to take early action on it, so that Hazard Analysis covers all high risk premises in their area as soon as possible. 
<p>
Finally on enforcement, Professor Pennington recommends, in the longer term, a review of the health risk condition contained in the Food Safety Act 1990, which governs among other matters the actions taken by Environmental Health Officers in emergencies. The key question is whether the present position unreasonably inhibits Environmental Health Officers for example in taking decisions under the emergency prohibition provisions in Section 12 of the Act, to close down premises merely on suspicion of connection with an outbreak. I have asked my officials to examine the practical operation of the emergency powers available to EHOs as a matter of urgency and in doing so to consult with consumers, health professionals, environmental health officers, processors and retailers.</i>"

<h4>Clearance for Riboflavin Produced from GMO</h4>
 
The Government has accepted the advice of the Advisory Committee on  Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) that food safety clearance should  be given to riboflavin derived from genetically modified (GM)  Bacillus subtilis using fermentation technology.
<p>
The B. subtilis was modified using both classical genetics to  deregulate the synthesis of riboflavin and genetic modification  techniques to change the regulatory sequences for the genes that code for the enzymes involved in the synthesis of riboflavin. in order to 
increase the yield of the vitamin.
<p>
The riboflavin (vitamin B2) which is identical to that produced by  traditional chemical means, will be used to fortify processed foods  such as breakfast cereals and soft drinks.
<p>
Copies of the full ACNFP report on riboflavin derived from  genetically modifed (GM) Bacillus subtilis using fermentation technology are available free of charge from the ACNFP Administrative Secretariat, Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, Room 239c,  Ergon House c/o Nobel House, 17 Smith Square, London SW1P 3JR.

<h4>Review of the Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulations 1984</h4>

The Ministry (MAFF) has issued a discussion paper on the review of the Meat Products and Spreadable Fish Products Regulations 1984.  The declared aim of the review is to slim down and simplify the Regulations as far as possible retaining only those provisions which are considered essential to ensure consumer protection and to allow the consumer to make a free but informed choice wherever possible.  This is part of the Government's commitment to review the Regulations as contained in the Government's Food Law Deregulation Plan (Autumn 1993) which initiated a process of revision, simplification and consolidation of food law to remove unnecessary burdens on business, improve competitiveness and increase consumer choice.
<p>
The discussion paper is 16 pages long and the following are the main points mentioned:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Objectives</b>: It is stated that:  "The Government is anxious that compositional regulations should not contain too much detail or be unnecessarily prescriptive and is particularly concerned to avoid overlap or duplication with other legislation, for example on matters already covered by horizontal EC Directives (e.g. on labelling, including the new 'QUID' provisions, and on colours or additives).  The Government therefore wishes to retain only such simplified provisions as are essential to ensure consumers are not defrauded or put at risk, or which may significantly help prevent public anxiety and confusion in relation to meat and meat products."
<p>
<li><b>Spreadable fish products</b>:  " ... in the absence of a clear need for specific regulations to cover these products, the Government  proposes, in the interest of simplification and deregulation, to revoke those parts of the 1984 Regulations concerned with spreadable fish products."
<p>
<li><b>Definition of meat content</b>:  The paper discusses whether a revised definition of meat is needed.  It then proposes the following revised definition "'meat' means striated muscle tissue, and may include the fat, skin, rind, gristle and sinew in amounts naturally attached to and closely associated with, or part of, the muscle used, of any animal or bird which is normally used for human consumption, and which includes any part of the carcase specified in Part 1 of Schedule 2 which is obtained from such animal or bird, but does not include any other part of the carcase."
<p>
<li><b>Declaration of Meat Content</b>:  The present requirement is likely to be retained although amended since they specify calculating meat content as a fraction of the final product weight, rather than on the basis of the inputs at the "mixing bowl" stage as required under 'QUID'.
<p>
<li><b>Added Water</b>:  The discussion paper appears to suggest that sufficient information will be available to consumers as a result of 'QUID'.  It states "The Government would only wish to consider retaining a simplified requirement for added water declaration if the consumer would not be provided with adequate information by some other means."
<p>
<li><b>Lean Meat</b>:  The 1984 Regulations have a definition of "lean meat content".  The Government has not yet come to a final view about the need to retain such a concept but three options are presented.
<p>
<li><b>Reserved Descriptions</b>:  The paper indicates that the Government is minded to revoke all but 3 of the present 20 reserved descriptions.  The 3 remaining would be for "burger", "sausage" and "pie" but in all cases there would be a simplification of the requirements.
<p>
<li><b>Mechanically Recovered Meat (MRM)</b>:  MRM is regarded as meat but it is already agreed that it should be separately declared in an ingredients list.  A definition of MRM is proposed for inclusion in the revised Regulations:  mechanically recovered meat means meat which has been obtained by mechanical means and had been passed through a fine mesh such that its cellular structure has been broken down and as such it flows in puree form.
</ul>
<p>
The paper is for discussion but it indicates that new legislative proposals will be prepared for consultation in the first half of 1997 with a view to implementation by 1 January 1998.

<h4>Revision of "Use By" Guidance Notes</h4>

As previously noted (See <a href="l-uk-96b.htm#96-27">20 September 1996</a>), the Ministry had been revising the "Use By" Guidance Notes following the updating of the Food Labelling Regulations in July 1996.  A final version of the guidance notes has now been prepared and is available.
<p>
The letter notes that the changes, as a result of comments:<br>
<ul>
<li>clarify the text and improve its presentation;
<li>clarify when a "use by" date expires (midnight on the date given in the use by date, not midnight of the day before);
<li>give additional guidance on when "use by" dates can be altered or removed;
<li>give additional information about the range of foods exempt from date marking; and
<li>explain the advisory role of local authorities.
</ul>
<p>
Apparently during the consultation exercise, some respondents sought specific definitions for terms such as "highly perishable", "immediate danger" and "short period of time".  The letter comments that these terms are used without definition in the Food Labelling Directive (79/112/EC) and it would be difficult and inappropriate to insert such definitions in the guidance notes.
<p>
Copies of the guidance notes can be obtained from the Ministry (MAFF, Food Labelling and Standards Division, Room 325d, Ergon House, c/o Nobel House, 17 Smith Square, London  SW1P 3JR).

<h4>Functional Foods and Health Claims - FAC Preliminary Conclusions</h4>

The Food Advisory Committee has been considering functional foods and health claims and has reached some preliminary conclusions on which it would welcome further comments.  The preliminary conclusions are given below but were circulate with some "Draft Guidelines on Health Claims on Foodstuffs".  A copy of these can be obtained from the Ministry (Contact the Ministry on 0171-238 6281).
<p>
The FAC has concluded:<br>
<ul>
<li>The market for functional foods in the UK is at present very small in the overall context of food sales, although it may be becoming significant in the yoghurt sector.
<li>Many of the health claims being made are unspecific "feel good" statements; some are linked to official recommendations and others are based on data exclusively held by those making the claims; some contain references to disease and may be misleading the consumer.
<li>Evidence of how consumers react to such claims is needed and some quantitative data will be available in the New Year.
<li>The approaches of other countries to regulation in this area are varied but it is noteworthy that most EU member states rely on the same legislative controls as already pertain in the UK supplemented in a few countries with guidelines.
<li>The FAC wishes to have further views on whether the UK should follow a similar route on the basis of draft guidelines or whether the main elements of the draft guidelines should be incorporated into further statutory rules o health claims.
<li>There also appears to be a need for advice to be available to companies and enforcement officers on health claims and the FAC suggests that these needs are met by trade associations and LACOTS establishing advisory services for their members, as is already done by ASA, PAGB and other bodies.
<li>The FAC invites comments on other options for assessing health claims
<li>The FAC has seen no convincing evidence for the need for pre-market approval of functional foods beyond the controls which already exist or will be implemented shortly on novel foods and additives.
</ul>
<p>
The Ministry has invited comments on these preliminary conclusions and on the draft guidelines on health claims.  Comments are requested before 31 March 1997.

<h4>Food Contact Materials</h4>

The Plastic Materials and Articles in Contact with Food (Amendment)(No 2) Regulations 1996 (SI 1996/2817) were laid before Parliament on 18 November and will come into force on 1 January 1997.
<p>
These Regulations, which are made under the Food Safety Act 1990, implement Directive 96/11/EC.  The Regulations amend the positive and "temporarily approved" lists of substances which can be used in the manufacture of food contact plastics.

<h4>Draft "Foods Intended for Use in Energy Restricted Diets for Weight Reduction Regulations 1997"</h4>

Following the adoption by the European Community of Commission Directive 96/8 on energy restricted diets for weight reduction, the Ministry has now issued draft regulations to implement the Directive.  Implementation has to be by 30 September 1997 with a transition until 31 March 1999.
<p>
The Draft Regulations contain:
<ul>
<li>A definition of "relevant food" - specially formulated food intended for use in energy-restricted diets for weight reduction, being food which complies with the compositional requirements in Schedule 1 and which, when used as instructed by the manufacturer, replaces: (a) the whole of the total daily diet; or (b) one or more meals of the daily diet.
<li>Restrictions on the name of the food and compositional requirements -
<ul>
<li>No person shall sell any relevant food under any name other than "total diet replacement for weight control" or "meal replacement for weight control" as appropriate.
<li>No person shall sell any food using the names in a) unless it is a "relevant food".
</ul>
<li>Labelling requirements - The Regulations specify the information which has to be given on the label.
<li>Weight loss claim -  No person shall sell any relevant food the labelling, advertising or presentation of which refers to the rate or amount of weight loss which may result from its use or to a reduction in the sense of hunger or an increase in the sense of satiety.
<li>Packaging -  All components of a relevant food intended as a replacement for the whole of the daily diet must be contained in the same package.
<li>Transitional Defence - It is a defence to prove that an act contrary to the requirements of the Regulations was committed before 31 March 1999
</ul>
<p>
There are 2 Schedules relating to composition:
<ul>
<li>Schedule 1 indicates the "Essential Composition of Relevant Foods" including energy, protein, fat, dietary fibre, vitamins and minerals.
<li>Schedule 2 provides the "Amino Acid Requirement Pattern" and is referred to in Schedule 1 under protein.
</ul>

Following the adoption by the European Community of Commission Directive 96/5 on processed cereal-based foods and baby foods for infants and young children, the Ministry has now issued draft regulations to implement the Directive.  Implementation has to be by 30 September 1997 with a transition until 31 March 1999.
<p>
The Draft Regulations contain:
<ul>
<li>Definitions -
<ul>
<li>Baby foods:  foods for particular nutritional use fulfilling the particular requirements of infants and young children in good health and intended for use by infants while they are being weaned, and by young children as a supplement to their diet or for their progressive adaptation to ordinary food other than processed cereal-based foods.
<li>Processed cereal-based foods:  foods for particular nutritional use with the categories in part 1 of Schedule 1 [see below] fulfilling the particular requirements of infants and young children in good health and intended for use by infants while they are being weaned, and by young children as a supplement to their diet or for their progressive adaptation to ordinary food.
<li>Other definitions are as in the Directive - this will include "infants" as being children under the age of 12 months and "young children" as being aged between 1 and 3 years
</ul>
<li>Exemptions:  The Regulations do not apply to any food which is a milk intended for young children
<li>Labelling:  The Regulations specify the requirement for labelling of processed cereal-based food and baby food
<li>Manufacture and composition:  No person shall manufacture any processed cereal-based food or baby food:
<ul>
<li>from any ingredient other than one whose suitability for particular nutritional use by infants and young children has been established by generally accepted scientific data;
<li>which does not comply with the compositional requirements specified in the schedules;
<li>which contains any added nutritional substance other than a nutritional substance listed in Schedule 4;
<li>which contains any substance in such quantity as to endanger the health of infants or young children.
</ul>
<li>Transitional Defence - It is a defence to prove that an act contrary to the requirements of the Regulations was committed before 31 March 1999.
</ul>
<p>
There are 5 Schedules relating to composition:
<ul>
<li>Schedule 1 relates to cereal-based foods for infants and young children. It includes the categories of such foods:
<ul>
<li>simple cereals which are or have to be reconstituted with milk or other appropriate nutritious liquids.
<li>cereals with an added high protein food which are or have to be reconstituted with water or other protein-free liquid.
<li>pastas which are to be used after cooking in boiling water or other appropriate liquids.
<li>rusks and biscuits which are to be used either directly or after pulverisation with the addition of water or other suitable liquids.
</ul>
It also includes the essential composition of the foods relating to cereal content, protein, carbohydrates, fat, minerals and vitamins
<li>Schedule 2 provides the essential composition of Baby Foods relating to protein, fat, sodium and vitamins
<li>Schedule 3 provides reference data on the amino acid of casein (to be used in conjunction with Schedule 1)
<li>Schedule 4 lists nutritional substances permitted for addition to the controlled foods
<li>Schedule 5 provides "Reference values for nutrition labelling for food intended for infants and young children" and relates to vitamins and minerals
</ul>
