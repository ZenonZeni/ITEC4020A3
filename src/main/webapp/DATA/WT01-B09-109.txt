<h3>Sacramento Electric Transportation Consortium (SETC)</h3><p>

<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  AFS Electromechanical Flywheel Battery<p>

Performing Organization:  American Flywheel Systems, Inc. (AFS)</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: AFS: Ed Furia (206) 454­1818</P>

<P><b>Project Summary: </b></P><P>The ARPA­supported AFS Program has the primary objective
to fabricate and test and engineering development unit (EDU) of its
electromechanical flywheel battery (EMFB). The EDU will be the basis for
developing a system prototype and pre­production versions of its EMFB suitable for
deployment in electric vehicles.</P> 

<P>To complete the ARPA­supported EDU program successfully, AFS has been
assisted by several highly­qualified specialists and widely acknowledged experts
from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the University of Virginia, and other
organizations through the program to date. To overcome the remaining challenges of
fabricating an energy-storage system for electric vehicle applications, AFS has
secured and will continue to acquire the services of experts in high­speed flywheel
rotors, magnetic bearings and motor generators, and other key subsystems.</P>
<P>
<B>Project Deliverables: </B></P>The primary deliverable under the ARPA­supported EDU
program is the demonstration by AFS that a high­speed, high specific energy EMFB
is technically feasible. 

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P><P>AFS currently intends to have the composite flywheel rotor
available by mid­1996 with testing to commence thereafter.</P>
