<H1>The Noordwijk Ministerial 
Declaration<BR>
on climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>The Noordwijk Ministerial Conference was a critical milestone on the road to 
international emission targets for carbon dioxide. </B>Held in November 1989 in Noordwijk, The 
Netherlands, the Conference was attended by representatives of 67 countries, 11 international 
organizations, and the Commission of the European Community (EC). The conclusions of the 
resulting Noordwijk Declaration on Atmospheric Pollution and Climate Change1 have often been 
referred to in subsequent climate debates.2 <P>
<B>The Declaration includes an important statement on stabilizing emissions of carbon 
dioxide (CO2):</B> "The Conference recognizes the need to stabilize, while ensuring stable 
development of the world economy, CO2 emissions and emissions of other greenhouse gases not 
controlled by <A HREF = "fs224.html">the Montreal Protocol</A>. 
Industrialized nations agree that such stabilization should be achieved by them as soon as possible, at 
levels to be considered by <A HREF = "fs208.html">the IPCC</A> and <A 
HREF = "fs221.html">the Second World Climate Conference</A> of 
November 1990. In the view of many industrialized nations such stabilization of CO2 emissions 
should be achieved as a first step at the latest by the year 2000."<P>
<B>Not all industrialized states represented at the conference were ready to make concrete 
commitments on emission targets.</B> Nevertheless, this statement was a first step towards the 
recognition of such targets. <A HREF = "fs211.html">The EC</A>, whose 
member states were among those agreeing to specific emission targets, referred back to the 
Noordwijk discussions when it established its policy targets on climate change in 1990.3<P>
<B>The Conference participants recognized a number of <A HREF = 
"fs202.html">key principles</A> of relevance to a climate 
treaty.</B> These included the concept of climate change as a common concern of humankind, the 
common but differentiated responsibilities of states, the sovereign right of states to manage their own 
natural resources, and the necessity of sustainable development.<P>
<B>The participants also endorsed the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) and the convening of the Second World Climate Conference.</B> Urging all 
states to participate in these efforts, they set out the issues which, in their view, the future climate 
treaty and its protocols should regulate. These included research on climate change, action to deal 
with greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of global warming, financial assistance and transfer of 
technology to developing countries, and sustainable management of forests.<P>
<B>The Conference Declaration asked the IPCC to conduct further research into emission 
targets and reforestation.</B> These requests were reiterated by the UN/ECE <A HREF = 
"fs220.html">Bergen Conference</A> in May 1990. The declaration 
suggested that the IPCC consider the feasibility of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by the year 
2005, as suggested by the conference held in <A HREF = 
"fs215.html">Toronto</A> in 1988. To this end, industrialized states were 
called upon to support IPCC. Another request was that the IPCC consider the feasibility of achieving, 
as a provisional target, a net forest growth of 12 million hectares a year by the beginning of the 21st 
century.<P>
<B>The Declaration contains specific proposals for action on emissions, funding, and research 
and monitoring. </B>These proposals relate to:<P>
	<B><I>Carbon dioxide</B></I>  In addition to collective action within the framework of the 
IPCC, countries should also take individual measures to reduce CO2 emissions by promoting better 
energy conservation and using environmentally sound energy sources. Industrial countries in 
particular were urged to work towards these aims. The need of developing countries for time to 
implement response measures was recognized, but the declaration also called upon them to make 
such efforts as were within their capabilities. <P>
 	<B><I>CFCs</B></I>  The Conference welcomed the efforts made within the framework of <A 
HREF = "fs224.html">the Vienna Convention and the Montreal 
Protocol</A> for protecting the ozone layer and urged all states to become parties to these 
instruments (fact sheet 224).<P>
 	<B><I>Other greenhouse gases</B></I>  As with CO2, efforts should be made to limit 
atmospheric concentrations of other greenhouse gases.<P>
 	F<B><I>unding</B></I>  Like many other conference statements, the Noordwijk Declaration 
recognized that financial assistance to developing countries is needed to help them cope with the 
causes and effects of climate change and to enable them to participate in the international climate 
negotiations. It recommended that existing development institutions give more weight to climate 
problems when planning their projects and that additional funds be made available. Funded projects 
should initially focus on, among other things,  phasing out CFCs, improving energy efficiency, and 
reforesting the land. <P>
	<B><I>Research and monitoring </B></I> More research should be undertaken on sources and 
sinks of greenhouse gases other than CO2. The Declaration urged all states to cooperate in research 
and monitoring activities.<P>
