MK has served the mining industry for more than 50 years and today the company’s Mining Group
operates mines in the United States and Germany and offers a wide range of mine development,
operations, engineering and reclamation capabilities on an international basis.<p>
The inclusion of Washington Construction Company’s mining operations into the Mining Group
expands the group’s revenue base and brings together two organizations that are like minded
in respect to maintaining cost-efficient projects where the health and safety of the work force is
of paramount importance.<p>
The group, based in San Antonio, Texas, operates a surface lignite mine near San Antonio that
provides three million tons of fuel per year for the nearby power plant of the mine’s owner,
San Miguel Electric Cooperative. In eastern Montana, the group operates a surface coal mine for
Westmoreland Resources, Inc. The approximately four million tons of coal produced annually at
this workings are loaded onto unit trains for transport to Midwestern power plants. Morrison
Knudsen Corporation owns a 24-percent interest in Westmoreland Resources.<p>
Add to this list of major U.S. contract mining operations, the Bullfrog Mine some 120 north of
Las Vegas, Nevada. Since 1988, Washington Construction has been mining and hauling up to
30 million tons of ore and waste per year from this workings, one of the largest gold mines in
the country. Two other Washington Construction contract operations that are now part of the
Mining Group are a quartzite mine and a limestone mine, both located in southern Idaho.<p>
Internationally, MK owns a one-third interest in MIBRAG, a coal mining and industrial firm in
Germany. In addition, the Mining Group operates three surface lignite mines under a contract
with MIBRAG. These mines produce a total of approximately 18 million tons of the brown coal
annually.<p>
The group began mining operations for MIBRAG in 1994 and since that time has dramatically
improved efficiency and safety by introducing modern western mining methods and equipment
to the mines that just a few years ago were state-owned entities in the former East Germany.
Recently, the MIBRAG mines achieved a record of 1.7 million working hours without a lost-time
accident – a record that exceeded goals set at the start of the program and that was an all-time
high in the history of coal mining in Germany.<p>
Target market areas for MK’s mining expertise include eastern Europe, South America,
Indonesia and selected southeast Asian countries. Earlier this year, an MK-led joint venture
was awarded an engineering, procurement and construction-management contract for installation
of coal processing, stockpiling and ship-loading equipment for a 3.8-million-ton-capacity
surface mine in Indonesia.<p>
MK serves the engineering needs of the mining industry with cutting-edge technology and
a wide range of capabilities. The Mining Group’s engineering operations provide services in
mining and civil engineering, and in surface and groundwater hydrology for mine design,
development, operations and environmental restoration.<p>
The group meets the geoscience needs of its clients with reserve evaluation, modeling and
fuel quality analysis. Extensive reclamation of MK-operated mines is the foundation of the
group’s environmental operations that includes expertise in range management,
threatened/endangered species, wildlife management, water quality, soil science, agricultural
engineering and wetlands.<p>
State-of-the-art technology in mine planning and resource development is augmented by
Auto Cad services, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), including ArcInfo and ArcCad,
and a full range of training and applications services related to the MINCOM mine planning
software.<p>
