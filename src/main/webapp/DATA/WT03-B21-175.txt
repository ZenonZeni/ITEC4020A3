<P>Toronto, Ontario, August 3, 1995 ... TVX GOLD INC. announced today that it has acquired a 50% interest in the Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold/silver deposits located in South Kamchatka, Russia, through the acquisition of 50% of the outstanding shares of Trevozhnoye Zarevo ("TZ"), a Russian company. TZ holds the licences for the development of these deposits. TVX is entitled immediately to a majority representation on the board of TZ and has the contractual right to increase its interest to 100% subject to compliance with Russian law. Under the terms of the agreement with TZ and its existing shareholders, TVX has advanced US$3,390,000 to TZ to be utilized to satisfy existing obligations of TZ. In order to maintain its 50% interest and to increase its interest, subject to compliance with Russian law, to 100% TVX is required to make instalment payments to TZ totalling US $5,260,000 up to completion of a feasibility study and final permitting, which payments substantially represent obligations under the development licences on these deposits. If commercial production is achieved, the current principals of TZ will be entitled to receive from the project payments totalling US$9,000,000 over the first seven years following commencement of commercial production. TVX has the right to relinquish its interest in TZ at any time with no continuing obligation to fund TZ.

<P>The Asacha and Rodnikovoe gold deposits are located in the Southern Kamchatkan gold-silver belt, within 100 and 60 km respectively, of the provincial capital of Petropavlovsk and are accessible by road. The mineralization style is the classic high-grade, bonanza epithermal-vein type, associated with recent volcanism of the circum Pacific region. Preliminary Russian metallurgical work has shown that a substantial amount of the identified reserves are in the nature of free gold and that recoveries in excess of 90% are achievable by gravimetric and normal cyanidation processes.

<P>The Kamchatkan regional government released reserve estimates in categories Cl and C2, which are broadly comparable to proven/probable categories under North American standards, for Asacha of 30.37 tons of gold and 58.8 tons of silver at grades of 22 g/t gold and 40 g/t silver and, for Rodnikovoe of 40.39 tons gold at 1 1 g/t and 342.9 tons silver at 98 g/t. Converted to ounces, based on the Russian categories, these deposits would contain 2.28 M/oz gold and 12.9 M/oz silver or a total of 2.45 M/oz of gold equivalent at today's prices.

<P>The licence areas cover 40 sq. km. and contain several additional high grade exploration targets not previously explored and which are believed to have a significant potential to substantially increase high grade ore reserves.

<P>Due to the substantial amount of work done on these properties and the high grade nature of the ore bodies, TVX anticipates that a feasibility study will be done in 1996.

<P>TVX views its interest in Asacha and Rodnikovoe as a first significant step into the former Soviet Union. TVX is currently looking at other opportunities in the Russian Far East, an area of the world which it believes has an excellent potential for significant gold production.
