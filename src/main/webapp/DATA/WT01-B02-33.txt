<P><center>Abstract</center><BR>

<P>The purpose of this study was to collect basic information about home educators and their students, their children, in the state of Oklahoma. The information might be used to build an accurate understanding of home education in Oklahoma. The study aimed to answer the following questions:<BR>
<ol><li>What are the demographic characteristics of home education families in Oklahoma?<BR>
<li>What are some of the pertinent characteristics of Oklahoma home schools?<BR>
<li>What are the academic learning outcomes (or academic achievement) of students educated at home in Oklahoma?<BR>
<li>What is the relationship between these students' academic learning outcomes (or academic achievement) and the following variables: (a) parent education level, (b) whether parents had been certified teachers, (c) family income, (d) whether religious beliefs were part of the rationale for participating in home education, (e) age of student, (f) gender of student, (g) race (or ethnic group) of student, (h) number of years student had been home educated, (i) hours of formal education in which the student was involved, (j) frequency of visits to libraries, (k) number of children in the family, and (l) amount of money the family spent on the child's home education. Alpha was set at .05 for tests of significance.</ol><BR>
<BR>
Two hundred fourteen families and 509 children were involved in this study. The median family income category in this study was $35,000-$49,999. The  formal education attainment of parents in this study was 2 or 3 years of college. At least four years of college were completed by 51.2% of the fathers and by 43.1% of the mothers. The vast majority (96% of the fathers and 99% of the mothers) reported they were &quot;born again&quot; in a Christian sense. Religious beliefs were part of the rationale for home schooling for 98% of these families. <BR>
     <BR>
Students in this study were similar to those in other home education research. There were approximately equal numbers of males and females. Grades 1 through 8 included 78.4% of the students in this study, while 65% were in grades 1 through 5.<BR>
     <BR>
The home educated students in this study scored, on the average, at or above the 82nd percentile in all areas tested (i.e., reading, listening, language, math, science, basic battery, and complete battery), with a high at the 89th percentile on the complete battery. These scores are largely consistent with, yet somewhat higher than, scores found in other home education research.<BR>
<BR>
Unexpectedly, there was no significant relationship between the formal education level of the parents and the academic achievement scores of their students. On the other hand, and contrary to the hypotheses, whether a student was a male and how long a student had been home educated were significantly and positively related to science achievement scores. These two variables, however, together explained only 3% of the variation in science scores. Also contrary to the hypotheses, the two variables of whether students' families were in the highest income category and whether they were not in one of the most common racial/ethnic categories were significantly and positively related to listening achievement scores. Again, however, these two variables together explained only 2% of the variation in listening scores.<BR>
     <BR>
As hypothesized, there were no significant relationships between student learning, as measured by standardized achievement tests, and the variables of (b), (d), (e), (i), (j), (k), and (l) listed above.<BR>
    <BR>
It is noteworthy that none of the examined variables explained significant amounts of variance in basic battery scores. This was not expected.<BR>
     <BR>
These findings, and those of other research, suggest that states and other political or educational entities need to consider factual information (such as that from this and other studies) on home education and the learning of its students as they develop policy and strive to serve home education families.<BR>
