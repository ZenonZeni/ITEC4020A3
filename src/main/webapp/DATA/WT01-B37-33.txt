<h1>BLACK JUDGES SPEAK OUT ON RACISM </h1>

<p><b>New Book Exposes Flaws in Justice System</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<p><b>Book Review</b> </p>

<p>Black judges criticize America's most popular anti-crime
policies as racist and proven failures during candid interviews
about the nation's system in the new book &quot;Black Judges on </p>

<p>Justice.&quot; </p>

<p>Mandatory sentencing is very popular with politicians who
posture themselves as &quot;tough on crime,&quot; but these harsh
imprisonment polices have &quot;not been effective in cutting
crime,&quot; states Los Angeles Municipal Court Judge Veronica S.
McBeth. McBeth is one of three female jurists included in the 14
judges interviewed in this book that has been described by one
reviewer as a &quot;seminal work.&quot; </p>

<p>The incarceration of huge numbers of young black males
nationwide, resulting largely from mandatory sentencing laws, is
termed &quot;a quiet kind of genocide&quot; by Joseph Brown of
Memphis, a trial court judge who trims his black judicial robes
in African kente cloth. </p>

<p>&quot;Black Judges on Justice&quot; is the first book to
present the views of leading African-American jurists serving on
the nation's federal and state benches. The black jurists
interviewed include: </p>

<p>Famed federal jurist A. Leon Higginbotham, who authored the
famous letter attacking the anti-black attitudes of now U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas; Bruce Wright, the feisty
New York City jurist who has won acclaim for his decades long
fight against racism in the judiciary, and Constance Baker
Motley, the first African-American female federal judge. </p>

<p>The jurists forthrightly discuss the inequities of race and
class which too often stack the deck of the justice system
against blacks. For example, the subtle but pervasive prejudices
of judges and prosecutors, which impact on decisions like who
gets probation and who goes to prison, are examined by Theodore
A. McKee, a Philadelphia judge who now sits on the federal Third
Circuit Court of Appeals. </p>

<p>The jurists in &quot;Black Judges&quot; provide rare insights
into the judicial decision making process, exposing how this
life-impacting process is often arbitrary and wholly unrelated to
laws. Further, the jurists present intriguing autobiographical
sketches of their accomplishments, often in the face of
tremendous adversity. The jurists were interviewed by
Philadelphia journalist (and STRONG advocate for Mumia!) Linn
Washington, Jr., a graduate of the Yale Law Journalism Fellowship
program. &quot;Black Judges on Justice,&quot; published by the
New Press, exposes many myths. It is widely believed in this
society that Black leadership is soft on crime. But Washington,
D.C. judge Reggie B. Walton served as President Bush's Assistant
Drug Czar and Senior White House Advisor on Crime. Walton says
one of his major frustrations working for the Bush Administration
was his inability to convince administration officials of the
fact that fighting crime is ineffective without attacking social
causes of crime. </p>

<p>Abigail R. Rogers, a family court judge in South Carolina and
the first black female jurist in that state, reveals how she has
been victimized by racism and sexism from whites and blacks
alike. </p>

<p>The author of &quot;Black Judges on Justice,&quot; Linn
Washington, is an award-winning investigative reporter and
editorial writer. A graduate of Temple University who holds a
masters degree from the Yale Law School, Washington has spent
much of his 20-plus years in journalism specializing in issues
involving race and matters related to the justice system.
Washington is a former assistant to the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and former executive editor of
&quot;The Philadelphia Tribune.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Black Judges on Justice&quot; is receiving favorable
reviews. &quot;The Quarterly Black Review&quot; describes the
book as an &quot;illuminating work ... that should be required
reading for anyone interested in the relationship between blacks
and the law.&quot; The magazine &quot;Booklist&quot; describes
the book as &quot;well-written and insightful&quot; while
&quot;Publisher's Weekly&quot; termed the book
&quot;thoughtful.&quot; &quot;Black Judges on Justice&quot; is on
the recommended reading lists of &quot;Essence&quot; and
&quot;Emerge&quot; magazines. </p>

<p>Derrick Bell, the distinguished law professor and expert on
racism in American law, has stated, &quot;Beleaguered
racial-equality forces will applaud Linn Washington's searingly
candid interviews with these courageous men and women who strive
both to alleviate unfairness in their courtrooms and to urge
reforms that, if adopted, would move courts toward justice and
away from the cynicism, racism, and moral bankruptcy in which
they are now mired.&quot; </p>
