<B> (WASHINGTON)</b></FONT><font size=3><b> -- Fluke Europe, B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fluke Corporation, an Everett, Washington-based manufacturer of electronic products, has agreed to pay civil penalties totaling $14,000 for twelve alleged violations of the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Act and Regulations, Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Frank Deliberti announced today.<P>

	While neither admitting nor denying the allegations, Fluke Europe, B.V., agreed to pay the civil penalty.  The company voluntarily disclosed the alleged violations to the Department.<P>

	The Commerce Department alleged that, on two occasions in 1993, in connection with export transactions to Kuwait, Fluke Europe furnished information about its and other companies' business relationships with companies blacklisted by the Arab League in its boycott of Israel, in violation of the Regulations.<P>  

	The Department also alleged that the company failed, on ten occasions, to report in a timely manner its receipt of boycott-related requests from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as required by the Regulations. <P>

	The antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Act and Regulations apply to foreign boycotts fostered or imposed against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott under United States law or regulation.<P>

	The antiboycott provisions prohibit U.S. individuals and companies from furnishing information about any person's business relationships:
<OL><LI> with or in a boycotted country;<BR>
<LI> with any business concern organized under the laws of a boycotted country; <BR>
<LI> with any national or resident of a boycotted country; or <BR>
<LI> with any other person known or believed to be restricted from doing business with or in one or more countries that participate in an unsanctioned foreign boycott, such as the Arab League boycott of Israel.</OL>
U.S. individuals and companies are also required to report to the Department, in a timely manner, each boycott-related request they receive.<P>
