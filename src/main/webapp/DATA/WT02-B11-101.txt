<CENTER><H2>Financing Package</H2><H2>Is Coming Together</H2><H2>For
Aguaytia Gas Project</H2></CENTER>
<P></P>
<P>One quarter of the $210 million financing for the Aguaytia integrated
natural gas project in Peru's eastern jungle will be coming from <B>Trust
Company of the West,</B> with the project partners putting up the rest,
according to Guillermo Ferreyros, marketing manager for project consortium <B>Aguaytia
Energy.</B> The <B>US Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC)</B> is granting
$200 million in insurance against political risk, its maximum for a single
project.</P>
<P>Aguaytia Energy is the new name for the consortium of US companies headed by
<B>Maple Gas</B> that will develop the natural gas fields of Aguaytia in the
department of Ucayali. Other participants in the consortium are<B> PanEnergy
Corp., El Paso Natural Gas, Illinova Generating Co., Power Markets Development
Co.</B> (a subsidiary of <B>Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light</B>) and the<B>
Scudder Latin American Trust for Independent Power.</B>  Company officials are
claiming Aguaytia is Latin America's first greenfield generation project to be
financed without power purchase agreements, or PPAs. </P>
<P>An estimated $62 million of the total investment will go into developing the
gas deposits. The remainder is tar geted for the thermal plants at Aguaytia and
Pucallpa, the pipelines, separation plants and 400 km of transmission lines. Two
generation units totaling 155 MW are being supplied by the European conglomerate
<B>ABB.</B></P>
<P>The absence of PPAs in a project of this size is unusual but &quot;the sale
of energy is guaranteed by the constant growth of the Peruvian market, the low
levels of supply and the competitive cost of the fuel,&quot; says Ferreyros. The
consortium estimates that the cost of energy supplied to consumers in Ucayali
will plummet from the present 7.5 US cents to three. Aguaytia will also produce
some 1,500 bpd of LPG.</P>
<P>All final authorizations for the project (which runs through several
departments of Peru's jungle, mountain and coast) are expected by late May. The
project will take between 18 and 20 months to complete.</P>
<H2>CAMISEA DEADLINE EXTENDED AGAIN</H2>
<P>The decision between the government and <B>Royal Dutch Shell</B> regarding
development of the vast Camisea natural gas fields has been extended a fourth
time and is now due in mid-May. Originally scheduled for December 1995, the
deadlines had previously been extended to February 29 and then to April 26
because of prolonged wrangling over royalty payments and the project timetable (<I>P&amp;F</I>
3/96).</P>
