NATA SEEKS EXTENSION OF COMMENT PERIOD ON FLIGHT AND DUTY TIME NPRM

   Citing the potentially "wide reaching effects on the Part 135 industry,"
the National Air Transportation Association asked FAA to extend the comment
period on a proposal to implement more restrictive flight and duty time
standards for commercial air carrier crew members. The NPRM, which was
announced last month, would base flight and duty limits on the amount of
time pilots and other crew members are on duty, rather than the current
system based on flight hours (BA, Dec. 18/263).
   In a letter to FAA Administrator David Hinson, NATA President James
Coyne noted that the NPRM culminates "over a decade's worth of debate
between the FAA and the industry. We are disappointed that the FAA notice
failed to differentiate between the regulation of scheduled operators and
those providing on-demand transportation." Coyne asked Hinson to extend
the comment period - which was set at 90 days in the NPRM - by another 90
days, noting that "in the absence of an emergency, and with the
importantance of the regulation, this would be a prudent action by the
agency."
   Coyne said NATA also "strongly recommends the FAA hold a series of
public meetings to gather information from those thousands of companies
that will be affected by the proposal. We are shocked and dismayed that
the FAA was unable to estimate the potential costs of the proposed rule on
air taxi operators. In our view, the best method to gather this
information is for the FAA to hold regional meetings to examine the affect
and the costs of the NPRM on this segment of the industry. NATA believes
it is critical for the agency to take this step to meet its obligation to
thoroughly analyze this important rulemaking action."

ATLANTIC AVIATION SIGNS NEW PACT WITH WILMINGTON MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES

   Atlantic Aviation Corp. said its maintenance personnel overwhelmingly
ratified a new labor agreement that extends into 1999. The new pact covers
some 200 technicians and maintenance personnel represented by the United
Auto Workers at Atlantic's principal maintenance facility and headquarters
in Wilmington, Del. Those workers perform a wide range of maintenance,
custom manufacturing, avionics installation, interior refurbishment and
painting of corporate aircraft.
   Ben E. Waide, III, who took over as chairman and chief executive of the
fixed-base chain in November (BA, Nov. 20/221), noted that the
negotiations, conducted after a long period of difficult restructuring by
Atlantic, "were conducted with a mutual respect and a focus on continued
improvement in the effectiveness and quality of our product." The
agreement, retroactive to Dec. 1, runs to March 1, 1999.
   The previous agreement provided hourly workers with a 1.15 percent
"supplemental bonus," but held wages at the same level and guaranteed
continuation of "flexible work processes" that had been instituted in 1992
(BA, May 24, 1993/203). In a telephone interview with BA last week, Waide
said the new agreement is "extremely positive" because the negotiations
reflected an understanding by both sides of what needs to be done to keep
the business strong. In addition to maintaining the work flexibility
provisions, he said the new pact provides a wage increase in each of the
three years and continues a "gain-sharing program" that increases payments
to workers as profitability increases. Waide said both sides agreed to
extend the termination date of the new agreement to March to avoid the end-
of-year business and holiday distractions incumbent in a December
expiration date.

LAMBERT TAKES OVER TOP JOBS AT AVIALL FOLLOWING TAYLOR'S DEPARTURE

   Robert G. Lambert, 65, who headed Dallas-based Aviall for nearly 20
years until his retirement three years ago, has taken over as president and
chief executive of the company. Aviall said he replaced Marshall B.
Taylor, who, the company said, "resigned to pursue other interests."
   Lambert led Aviall, Inc. and its predecessor companies from August 1973
until December 1992, when he became a consultant to Ryder System's
worldwide aviation services. One year later he was named board chairman of
Aviall, Inc., when that entity was spun off from Ryder System, Inc. He
will now hold all three titles.
   Lambert said Aviall "is continuing to study various strategic
alternatives to improve shareholder return and better position the company
for the future." He added that "Aviall's performance since it was spun off
from Ryder System has been disappointing to the board and Aviall's
shareholders. We intend to focus management's attention on these matters
while continuing our strategic evaluation of Aviall's business."
   Aviall claims to be the largest distributor of parts and supplies and
the largest independent provider of maintenance and overhaul services for
commercial aviation turbine engines. The company said it had $863 million
in sales in 1994. A spokesman said Aviall expects total 1995 revenues of
approximately $850 million, with the decline reflecting some discontinued
product lines. Through the first nine month of 1995 Aviall reported
revenues of $647.5 million and net income of $8.5 million, or 44 cents per
share. Aviall has approximately 3,000 employees, including more than 1,200
in the Dallas area and another 700 at a major overhaul facility in
Prestwick, Scotland.

ERA COMPLETES PURCHASE OF ALASKA HELICOPTERS ASSETS

   ERA Aviation, Inc., Anchorage, Alaska, said it completed the purchase of
certain assets of Alaska Helicopters, Inc. for approximately $10 million.
ERA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rowan Companies, Inc., Houston, Tex.,
said the purchases includes the hangar and office space adjacent to ERA's
existing facilities at Anchorage International Airport, 15 Bell helicopters
and related spare parts. ERA paid $3 million in cash, with the balance in
a promissory note due December 1996. Rowan Companies also announced last
week it had completed the sale of its three submersible barge rigs for
approximately $12 million. Rowan provides international and domestic
offshore contract drilling and aviation services for the petroleum
industry.

NATA'S JIM COYNE MAKES SUCCESSFUL LANDING AFTER ENGINE FAILURE

   National Air Transportation Association President James Coyne made a
successful landing at Steamboat Springs, Colo. last week after the No. 2
engine on his Beech Baron failed. Coyne, his wife, Holly, and three
children were about 25 miles from Hayden Airport enroute to a ski vacation
when the engine blew, covering the right cowling with oil. "It's not
something you like to see, when the oil pressure drops to zero," Coyne
said, "and it drops real fast."
   The engine failed when the Baron was at 11,000 feet enroute to the
6,602-foot airport and Coyne said he was thankful the problem did not arise
30 miles earlier in the flight when the aircraft was over terrain higher
than the Baron's single-engine service ceiling. As it was, the landing was
relatively uneventful, Coyne said, noting the "severe clear" conditions
that prevailed, the airport's 10,000 foot runway and his belief that
"Barons fly real well" on one engine. Another positive factor was the fact
Coyne had completed an instrument recurrency check just four weeks earlier
that included engine-out practice. He said the engine failure apparently
was caused when a piece of cylinder ring broke off and wedged between a
cylinder and the piston wall.
   Contacted by BA in Steamboat Springs, Coyne said last week's incident is
the second time in 20 years he's experienced an engine failure in his
Baron, adding that his entire family was aboard on both occasions. It is
also the second time this year Coyne will have had to leave his airplane
behind for repairs when he returns home. His Baron was partially covered
by flood waters while parked at the airport in New Orleans during NATA's
convention there last spring, which necessitated extensive repairs and
repainting (BA, May 15/207).

GARRETT SAYS NEW STC WILL PERMIT 731 JETSTARS TO MEET STAGE 3 NOISE LIMITS

   Garrett Aviation Services is marketing a new supplemental type
certificate for operators of Garrett 731-powered JetStar business jets that
will permit those aircraft to meet FAR Part 36 Stage 3 noise regulations.
The STC was issued to Star 3 STC, Inc., a company formed for the purpose of
acquiring the STC, which in turn has signed an agreement making Garrett
Aviation Services the sole marketing agent. The STC, applicable to both
731 JetStar conversions and JetStar II business jets, limits the aircraft
to a maximum takeoff weight of 44,500 pounds and a maximum landing weight
of 36,000 pounds, but imposes no significant performance penalties. A
Garrett spokesman said the STC, priced at $24,500, involved changes to the
aircraft flight manual and the posting of a placard adjacent to the
aircraft data plate. Garrett officials believe there are 99 Garrett 731-
powered JetStars in operation worldwide. For more information, contact
Jeff Holm, airframe and modification manager at Garrett's Los Angeles,
Calif. facility, at (310) 568-3845.

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT CAUTIONS AGAINST USING GPS AS SOLE MEANS OF NAVIGATION

   The military followed up recent satellite-based Global Positioning
System accuracy problems with a warning to its operators "not to be
overconfident" about the system. The advisory followed incidents in which
several types of GPS receivers experienced position signals that were in
error by as much as 20 to 40 nautical miles. The Defense Department's GPS
Joint Program Office (JPO) said the problem was caused by "corrupted data
in the receiver and can occur when crypto keys....are loaded into an
unkeyed receiver." While the encryption key problem would not affect
civilian users, sources who support retaining a backup for GPS say the
military experience shows that something might go wrong and leave only dead
reckoning as an alternative if FAA carries out plans to phase out all other
types of navigation aids. The JPO said it is "aggressively investigating
other possible scenarios that can corrupt the data resulting in navigation
errors with no warning."
   "This problem is specific to the military, but we are saying something
else might go wrong" that would impact civil users, a source said. "This
is an instance in the military arena where something could go wrong, and it
did. The message is that a complementary or auxiliary system is needed in
case something does go wrong." The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association,
the National Association of State Aviation Officials and several other
industry and user groups have pleaded with DOT - to no avail - to keep
funding the Loran C navigation system. DOT's latest Federal
Radionavigation Plan calls for eliminating Loran C funding after 2000.
Previous FRPs called for Loran C funding to 2015.
   Richard Arnold, who leads the integrated product team for GPS and
navigation at FAA, and Joe Dorfler, product leader for GPS at the agency,
said they have been aware "for some time" of the problem the military is
having. Dorfler said the Wide Area Augmentation System, scheduled to be
commissioned in 1998, will alert airmen if GPS signals are not to be
trusted. He said that before WAAS is available, FAA-certified GPS
receivers will have receiver autonomous integrity monitoring as an
augmentation.
   Arnold said FAA is "working on a gradual schedule. We will be
absolutely assured that the system we will put together will be robust and
will be backed up by ground-based navaids." Arnold acknowledged that Loran
C and nondirectional beacons are to be phased out in 2000, "but we will
still have the VOR system and the ILS, which do not show phaseout until
2010." Arnold said, however, that "if WAAS proves out, we may accelerate
all that transition. But we are not going to do anything until the [air
traffic control] system is equally as safe as it is now, and we think it
will be better." In a widely circulated message to military commands, the
JPO said GPS "provides the most useful and accurate navigation solution
available, but we caution operators not to be overconfident in the system.
Appropriate cross-check of GPS with other forms of navigation (inertial
navigation sets, radar, radio navaids, Doppler, dead reckoning, visual
methods, etc.) should be employed to ensure safety and mission
accomplishment."

FAA EXTENDS COMMENT PERIOD FOR INSTRUCTOR, SCHOOL REGULATIONS

   Federal Aviation Administration has extended until Feb. 12 the comment
period for proposed regulations for pilot, flight and ground instructor,
and pilot school certification (BA, Aug. 14/67). Helicopter Association
International requested the extension, saying that the proposal contains
several far-reaching changes and that "the sheer bulk and detail of those
changes warrant more than 120 days to prepare well-reasoned comments," FAA
said. For more information on the proposal, contact John Lynch in the
General Aviation and Commercial Division at (202) 267-3844. Comments
should be sent in triplicate to FAA, Office of the Chief Counsel (Attn.:
Rules Docket AGC-200), Docket No. 25910, 800 Independence Ave., S.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20591.

AIR FORCE SEEKING PROPOSALS FOR UPGRADING T-38 AVIONICS SYSTEMS

   The U.S. Air Force issued a request for proposals and is seeking bidders
for design and installation of upgraded avionics on the venerable T-38
Talon trainer. The winning contractor will have total system performance
responsibility and receive three separate contracts, according to the USAF
Aeronautical System Center.
   "Our program goal is to upgrade the AT/T-38 aircraft avionics and
aircrew training devices to provide pilots with the essential avionics and
cockpit management skills necessary for transitioning to follow-in major
weapons system aircraft," said Kathy Cliett, program manager for the T-38
upgrade.
   The basic contract will call for a 36-month engineering and
manufacturing phase. Six production options to buy 425 shipsets of
avionics will be included. Source selection is scheduled from February to
next summer, to be followed by a three-year engineering development phase.
Production is scheduled to begin in September 2004. The winning contractor
also will be awarded an avionics support and a T50/T51 simulator
maintenance contract.

FAA PLANS HELICOPTER NAVIGATION PROJECT, INCREASED SECURITY DURING
OLYMPICS

   The Federal Aviation Administration and a number of other government and
industry partners will use the occasion of the 1996 Summer Olympics in
Atlanta to demonstrate the capabilities of satellite navigation, data link
and other technologies for helicopter operators. FAA will spend about $2
million in the Atlanta area for temporary duty personnel, overtime,
security enhancements and installation and operation of four mobile air
traffic control towers from July 15 through Aug. 9. An additional 75
employees will be on temporary duty before and during the Olympics. FAA
expects a 25 percent increase in air traffic in the Atlanta area during the
event.
   FAA will operate temporary ATC services at six general aviation airports
and implement a reservation system for general aviation aircraft operations
throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. VFR arrival slot reservations
will be required at five airports, and non-scheduled IFR arrival/departure
slot reservations will be required at 13 airports. FAA will establish
restricted airspace over Olympic venues and publish VFR helicopter routes
about six months before the Olympics.
   The helicopter navigation project, known as the Atlanta Short Haul
Transportation System, is a joint initiative of FAA, the Helicopter
Association International and other industry groups, a number of local
businesses and various agencies, including NASA and the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. FAA will set up landing zones and routes to accommodate
increased demand for short-haul air transportation, such as emergency
medical services and express package delivery.
   In addition to anticipated large numbers of helicopters that will
operate by VFR only during the Olympics, about 50 helicopters will use the
Global Positioning System to navigate through this route structure. Using
data link, movement of the specially equipped helicopters will be monitored
by a personal computer-based system. The helicopter routes will be
established over interstate and multi-lane highways and will be designed to
avoid residential areas. Half of the $10 million cost of the demonstration
program will be borne by FAA and the remainder divided among other
participants in the program. FAA estimates that the system will have an
economic impact in the area of $15 million to $19 million.
   Plans for security include a "Security Command Center" at FAA's Southern
Region office in Atlanta to coordinate aviation security efforts with
airports near venue sites, which are located in several states. FAA also
recently approved $1.2 million in Airport Improvement Program funds for 11
security enhancements at Hartsfield Atlanta Airport. The AIP projects are
airport security fence improvements, terminal vehicle intrusion barriers,
ballistic-film on terminal windows, a north cargo area guard post, portable
X-ray machines and a film processor, police booths, enhanced security at a
storage area for explosives and K-9 training aids, a remote-controlled
robot for retrieval of explosives, a vehicle for transporting explosives to
a bomb disposal site, communications equipment and police vehicles.

UTC WOULD CONSIDER AEROSPACE ACQUISITIONS

   United Technologies Corp. is not interested in selling its aerospace
units, but is looking for future acquisitions, company President and Chief
Executive George David said last month. UTC's two aerospace units -
Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney - have been the subject of merger and sell-off
rumors recently. Earlier last year, David would not rule out putting
Sikorsky up for sale. In August, rumors of a merger between Pratt &
Whitney and fellow engine maker Rolls-Royce resurfaced, but both denied
that such a move was underway. Asked last month whether a shrinking defense
market would drive UTC to other fields, David said the company has been
heavily involved in defense for many years, adding that, "we have no
intention of not being right smack in the middle of that. Armed conflict
is going to be in our future."
   Rather than selling the two business units, David said "it might even be
nice if we could make an acquisition or two or three," adding that the any
such addition would have to be a good fit for UTC. He said he would
consider acquisitions in either the engine or helicopter business, adding
that the main obstacle to date has been a lack of candidates.

THE COST of the budget gridlock between Congress and the White House was

THE COST of the budget gridlock between Congress and the White House was
expected to increase sharply with the advent of the new year. Barring any
last-minute agreement to end the budgetary stalemate, a variety of excise
taxes on aviation were due to expire Dec. 31. Nel Sanders, senior manager
of state and tax issues for the National Business Aircraft Association,
told BA the taxes scheduled to expire include the 10 percent passenger
ticket tax, the 6.25 percent cargo waybill tax, the 15-cent and 17.5-cent
levies on each gallon of aviation gasoline and jet fuel, respectively, and
the $6 international departure fee. Those taxes generate some $6 billion
annually for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which provides about 70
percent of FAA's annual budget. A 4.3-cent-per-gallon "transportation
fuels tax" on jet fuel and avgas will continue to be collected.

SINCE THE TAXES

   SINCE THE TAXES on noncommercial aviation fuel are assessed at the
refinery and included in the pump price, aircraft operators will probably
have to file for refunds from the Internal Revenue Service to recoup the
15-cent and 17.5-cent per gallon levies.

   LINDA DASCHLE, FAA's deputy administrator, said the agency will tap the
accumulated balance in the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to finance the
agency's operations and acquisitions until the ticket, waybill and
departure tax levies are reinstated.

THE DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR

   THE DEPUTY ADMINISTRATOR also said the agency plans to meet an April 1
deadline to establish procurement and personnel reforms called for in the
fiscal 1996 transportation appropriations bill. She said eight working
groups - comprising outside consultants and FAA personnel - have been
formed to address issues raised by the reform provisions of the
legislation. The objective is to make FAA "the highest performing
[government] agency at the lowest cost," according to officials. One
initial goal - cutting equipment acquisition time by one-third - is being
revisited in an effort to reduce cycle times even further.

AIR TOUR OPERATORS

   AIR TOUR OPERATORS expect 1996 will be challenging as they attempt to
ward off additional federal regulation spurred by environmental interests.
In addition to an ongoing rulemaking effort by FAA and the National Park
Service to develop a national policy regarding park overflights, FAA has
been asked to adopt a preemptive ban on overflights of Rocky Mountain
National Park, located just northwest of Boulder, Colo., even though no air
tour flights are operating there. Depending on FAA's response to that
request, the agency may be asked to impose similar bans in other areas that
could affect both air tour and other air traffic. In addition, Grand
Canyon tour operators are very concerned about Park Service proposals to
dramatically expand the size of "flight-free" zones around the canyon and
compress air tour and transient traffic into relatively narrow corridors.

FAA OFFICIALS

   FAA OFFICIALS tell BA they're sticking with a Jan. 1, 1997 date for
implementing new Reduced Vertical Separation Minimums (RVSM) for flights
operating over the North Atlantic, even though many corporate aircraft that
regularly transit the North Atlantic will not be able to obtain, install or
get FAA approval of navigation equipment that will meet the stricter
standards by those dates. Implementation of RVSM is designed to permit
1,000-foot vertical separation at altitudes between FL 290 and FL 410. Tony
Broderick, FAA's associate administrator for regulation and certification,
said aircraft currently approved for transatlantic flights can continue
such operations, but they will be restricted to operating on the current
track system with the same in-trail and vertical separation standards that
now apply.

   FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, noting that the industry-wide random
drug testing rate continues to be less than one percent positive, has
decided to continue requiring random tests of 25 percent of covered
employees through 1996. The agency formerly required that 50 percent be
tested, but the new level still is far above the 10 percent test rate
advocated by industry.

ONE OF THE FIRST

   ONE OF THE FIRST recommendations from the National Academy of Public
Administration's study of National Air and Space Museum operations is the
speedy appointment of a new director "who can implement changes in the
organization." Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman, who requested the
study, named a seven-member committee to recommend a short list. Several
industry groups have suggested former NTSB member and FAA Administrator
Donald Engen for the job (BA, July 17/24). The panel includes four high-
level museum employees, and they or their immediate superiors will report
to the new director.

BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON MODEL 206B AND 206L

   BELL HELICOPTER TEXTRON Model 206B and 206L helicopters (Docket No.
93-SW-04-AD; Amdt. 39-9438; AD 95-24-06) - supersedes an existing AD that
requires a revision to the Limitations section of the FAA-approved
Supplemental Type Certificate Rotorcraft Flight Manual Supplement until
replacement of the engine power-out warning sensors on certain Model 206B
and 206L helicopters equipped with Allison 250-C20R engines. This
amendment also requires a revision to the Limitations section, but removes
the requirement for replacement of the engine power-out warning sensor.
This amendment is prompted by a reevaluation of the need for an engine
power-out warning sensor based on the lack of reported operational
occurrences of the false engine-out warnings. The actions specified by
this AD are intended to maintain a heightened pilot awareness that false
engine-out warnings may occur when practicing autorotations and could
result in an unnecessary emergency autorotative landing.

JETSTREAM HP137 MK1, SERIES 200 AND MODELS 3101 AND 3201

   JETSTREAM HP137 Mk1, Series 200 and Models 3101 and 3201 airplanes
(Docket No. 95-CE-10-AD) - proposes to supersede an AD that requires
repetitive inspection of the nose landing gear actuator support structure
and the front pressure bulkhead and replacement of any cracked part. This
proposal would retain the repetitive inspections, and would require
repetitive inspections of the nose landing gear retraction jack upper
mounting fitting and attachment hardware for security bolt failure or for
bolts with improper torque levels. The proposal would require replacement
of any failed security bolts, adjustment of an any bolt with an improper
torque level and modification of the nose lading gear retraction jack as a
terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The proposed action is
prompted by reports of nose landing gear jack mounting fitting failures and
by FAA's policy on aging commuter-class aircraft. The actions specified in
the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the nose landing gear
caused by a cracked nose landing gear actuator support structure or cracked
front pressure bulkhead, which could lead to nose gear collapse. Comments
on the proposal must be sent in triplicate before Feb. 9 to FAA, Central
Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th St.,

propeller hub for cracks. This action also requires a one-time eddy
current inspection for cracks in the threaded areas of the propeller hub
followed by modification of the hub to contain oil with red dye as a
terminating action to the repetitive inspections. This amendment is
prompted by reports of cracked propeller hubs. The actions specified in
this AD are intended to prevent propeller blade separation due to a cracked
propeller hub, which could result in separation of the engine from the
aircraft and subsequent loss of aircraft control.

airplanes (Docket No. 90-CE-59-AD) - proposes to supersede an AD that
requires repetitive inspections of the main landing gear inboard door
hinges and attachment angles for cracks and replacement of any cracked main
landing gear inboard door hinge or attachment angle. FAA's policy on aging
commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce
the number of certain repetitive short-interval inspections when improved
parts or modifications are available. The proposed action would retain the
repetitive inspections and require the incorporation of an improved main
landing gear inboard door hinge and attachment angle assembly or approved
hinges and angles made of steel as a terminating action for the repetitive
inspection requirement. The actions specified by the proposal are intended
to prevent separation of the inboard main landing gear door from the
airplane caused by a cracked inboard door hinge or attachment angle. This
condition could jam the main landing gear and cause loss of control of the
airplane during landing. Comments on the proposal must be sent in
triplicate before Feb. 21 to FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant
Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th St., Kansas City, Mo. 64106. Specify

ROBINSON MODEL R22 SERIES HELICOPTERS

   ROBINSON Model R22 series helicopters (Docket No. 95-SW-06-AD; Amdt.
39-9425; AD 95-23-05) - supersedes an existing AD that requires an
inspection and repetitive visual checks for slippage of the tail rotor
drive and replacement of the tail rotor gear-box, if necessary. This
amendment requires disassembly of the T/R gearbox to verify the
installation of the input and output shaft keys between the input and
output pinions and their respective shafts. This amendment is prompted by
two incidents in which the key was not installed between the output shaft
and the output pinion during assembly of the tail rotor gearbox at
Robinson. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent
slippage of the tail rotor drive, loss of directional control and
subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

SENSENICH MODELS M76EMM, M7EMMS, 76EM8, AND 76EM8S() METAL PROPELLERS

   SENSENICH Models M76EMM, M7EMMS, 76EM8, and 76EM8S() metal propellers
(Docket No. 95-ANE-03) - proposes to revise an existing AD that restricts
operators from continuously operating the propeller at engine speeds from
2,150 and 2,350 revolutions per minute (RPM). This action would delete
propellers installed on certain Textron Lycoming O-360 series reciprocating
engines with solid crankshafts from this requirement, and update the
referenced Sensenich service bulletin with the latest revision. Reworking
of all affected propeller models remains a requirement of the proposal,
regardless of engine installation. This proposal is prompted by inquiries
concerning tachometer red arc restrictions on certain Lycoming O-360 series
reciprocating engines with solid crankshafts. The actions specified by the
proposal are intended to prevent propeller blade tip fatigue failure, which
can result in loss of control of the aircraft. Comments must be sent in
triplicate before Feb. 5 to FAA, New England Region, Office of the
Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, Mass.

TEXTRON LYCOMING 235 SERIES, 290 SERIES, AND CERTAIN 320 AND 360 SERIES
RECIPROCATING ENGINES

   TEXTRON LYCOMING 235 series, 290 series, and certain 320 and 360 series
reciprocating engines (Docket No. 94-ANE-44) - proposes to require initial
and repetitive inspections of the crankshaft inner diameter for corrosion
and cracks, and replacement of cracked crankshafts with a serviceable part.
This proposal permits operation of engines with crankshafts that are found
to have corrosion pits, but are free of cracks, provided that repetitive
inspections are performed until the next engine overhaul or five years
after the initial inspection, whichever occurs first. At that time
crankshafts with corrosion pits, but no cracks, must be replaced with
serviceable crankshafts. This proposal is prompted by reports of
crankshaft breakage stemming from corrosion pits on the inside wall. The
actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent crankshaft
failure, which can result in engine failure, propeller separation, forced
landing and possible damage to the aircraft. Comments on the proposal must
be sent in triplicate before Jan. 29 to FAA, New England Region, Office of
the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington,
Mass. 01803-5299. Specify docket number.
