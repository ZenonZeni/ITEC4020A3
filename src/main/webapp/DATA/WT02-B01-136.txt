<PRE>SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT:

     The trial court found that Rev. Brown could not submit evidence as to 
his religious establishment and exericse, to the jury.  The court based 
it's decision on the Fifth Circuit's decision in 1967, in Leary v. U.S., 
383 F.2d 851.  In doing so, the court ignored all the precedent to 
compelling interest and least restrictive means developed since Reynolds 
v. U.S., 98 U.S. 244 in 1878.  Even more significant of it's prejudice, 
the court refused to recognize the established precedent of the Eighth 
Circuit in Warner v. Graham, 675 F.Supp. 1177, in 1987 and a half dozen 
decisions reached under the Religous Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, 
including the Eighth Circuit decision in Rust v. Clarke, 851 F.Supp. 377 
in 1994.
     The trial court summarily dismissed all defenses advanced by Rev. 
Brown regarding Natural Law, Common Law, the Declaration of Independence, 
the U.S. Constitution, Necessity, and the lack of Federal powers under the 
Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, without allowing any showing 
of evidense, testimony, or argument.  In doing so it abused its discretion 
and deprived Rev. Brown of even a shadow of a fair trial under DUE 
PROCESS.
     The trial court threatened Rev. Brown's assisting attornney in a 
letter dated October 25, 1994.  The court refused to hold a hearing on a 
motion for clarification of attorneys duties ex parte which is required as 
this is a matter of attorney client privelege.  The trial court created 
rules for standby counsel which substantially deprived Rev. Brown of the 
assistance of counsel.  This constitutes an abuse of discretion on the 
part of the trial court.
     The trial court refused to question two jurors who were overheard 
discussing the case and making disparaging remarks about the defendant on 
a break the second day of trial.  The trial court refused to substitute 
the extra jurrors for these two prejudiced jurors and substantially 
deprived Rev. Brown of Due Process.
     For all these reasons, Rev. Brown has been deprived of his 
constitutional rights and has been deprived of Due Process.  For these 
reasons the conviction of Rev. Brown must be set aside and appropriate 
relief granted to him.
