RE:&nbsp; Mr. Allen D. Helmers <br>
<br>
<br>
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Mr. Helmers is a patient in our
office.&nbsp; He has a significant past history because of
multiple motorcycle and car accidents dating back to 1980.&nbsp;
In August 1994 he was hit by a drunk driver when he was on his
motorcycle and had a fracture of his left lower leg.&nbsp; He has significant
complaints of pain which do not seem to respond to the usual
medical management.&nbsp; He has been seen in the Chronic Pain
Program.&nbsp; Mr. Helmers reports to me that he gets relief when
he smokes marijuana. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>It has been known in the medical field,
particularly in the area of rehabilitation, that chronic
neurogenic pain responds well to the medicinal use of
marijuana.&nbsp; The amount of marijuana is low and the effect is
significant causing much less side effects than the standard pain medications. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>We have utilized a number of routine and
not so routine medications to manage his pain, none of which has
been successful. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Although marijuana is not legally approved
for use in pain treatment, I know that many chronic pain patients
utilize it without problems just to manage their pain with a significant
reduction of the other pain medications. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><tt>Sincerely, <br>
<br>
<br>
W. H. Verduyn, M.D. <br>
