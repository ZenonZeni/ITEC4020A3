<blockquote>
<B>Project Title:  Small Flywheel Battery Systems for Vehicle Power Management <p>
Performing Organization:Advanced Technology Program State of Texas, State Match Pool, Allied-Signal Aerospace, Avcon
Controls Inc., Central and Southwest Utilities</B><p>

<P>POINT OF CONTACT: Joe Beno <BR>
The University of Texas at Austin,<br>
Center for Electromechanics<br>
Telephone: (512) 471­4496

<P><B>Program Summary: </B></P> 


<P>UT­CEM is exploiting its high performance composite rotor technology, developed with over S20M of
DOD funding, to develop a stand alone flywheel battery system, complete with power electronics, for
vehicular applications. The flywheel will store 2kW­h of energy, and produce 100­150 kW of power and
will be field tested on a transit bus in the future Other members of the team, AVCON and Allied Signal
Aerospace Company, will provide complementing magnetic bearing and motor/generator expertise
respectively.
</P>
<P>The primary objective of the project is to develop dual­use stand alone flywheel battery systems, for
military and commercial applications Future military requirements for power averaging are more
demanding than commercial applications, and will demand the advanced rotor technology being
applied in this project. This becomes even more critical with the next generation of combat vehicles,
employing EM guns, EM suspensions and EM countermeasures. Until now, flywheel battery systems
have either been low risk and low performance devices or expensive, high risk, moderate performance
designs. Under this ARPA program, UT­CEM will provide the advanced composite rotor technology,
developed in DOD programs, for the most demanding high performance flywheels. Additionally
UT­CEM will develop techniques to reduce costs for the high performance rotor to be as low as or
lower than conventional wet wound filament technology.</P>

<P>This project, top fabricate a moderate­cost high performance composite flywheel battery system,
capitalizes on an alliance of mass transit providers, university technology developers, and commercial
manufacturing entities. For this reason, the program structure encompasses the elements necessary
to develop the required production technology, formulate component manufacturing plans which are
guided by customer-driven system designs, and introduce the technology to the marketplace. Each
member of the alliance has a vested interest in producing these systems in large numbers and is
investing considerable resources to insure the success of the program with the ultimate goal of producing a commercially viable unit. Commercial viability will also be enhanced by the composite rotor manufacturing tasks to reduce fabrication costs in the project.</P>

<P>In a companion project, UT­CEM is leading an effort to develop safety and containment technology to
enable future vehicle integration and field demonstration. This effort is being conducted by a team of
the leading U.S. Flywheel battery developers, DOE National Laboratories, and the leading U.S spin
test facility.
</P>
<P>The program schedule will have preliminary testing of the UT­CEM flywheel battery in early summer
1996; final flywheel battery testing and cyclical duty cycle testing in Fall 1996; containment and
flywheel ring burst testing from April 1996­May 1997; integration into a transit bus in early 1997; and
field testing in mid­late 1997.</P>
