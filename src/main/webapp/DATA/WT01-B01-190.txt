<B>Abstract</B><BR>
<p>Financial pressure created from the increasingly competitive managed 
care environment has forced administrators to rethink the way we deliver 
health care and the way we strategically invest in technology.  As health
 care providers, we must focus on providing quality care as the fundamental
 goal, while always keeping an eye on the bottom line. In our efforts to 
reduce costs, the primary efforts have been to re-engineer work flow and 
to strategically reduce materials and supply costs. Historically, technology
 has primarily served a clinical role in the OR often with little regard 
to cost. More recently, however, technology is emerging which can help health 
care institutions provide quality care at lower costs.</p>

<P>Our hospital performed a detailed study of one such technological 
advancement, the Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning 
(AESOP), a robotic arm which gives the surgeon the ability to control 
the operative field of view using simple voice commands. The results of 
our study indicate improved OR productivity, a positive budget impact
 measured in hard dollars, and a high level of surgeon satisfaction1.  
Specifically, we were able to convert the productivity improvements
 attributable to AESOP into a savings of 0.74 FTEs. Coupled with a cumulative
 return on incremental billings, the system produced a hard dollar net 
improvement to our bottom line of $49,000 per year. This represents an
immediate ROI of 391% based on current monthly rental pricing. In an 
outright purchase a 100% ROI would be achieved in 11 months, and an 
institution with similar utilization rates would stand to gain over 
$200,000 over 5 years.</p>

<B>A Changing Paradigm in Health Care</B><BR>

<P>Our nation’s health care system has undergone significant 
change under the presence of managed care. "Employers, stung 
by spiraling health care premiums, know the system has excess 
capacity (it’s said half of hospitals could close tomorrow 
without displacing any patients) and are determined to squeeze 
it out."2 On a regional basis employers and insurers have adopted
 a group purchasing behavior, buying services from only a few 
large integrated networks, and creating new control over significant
 volumes of patient services. This market strategy has dramatically
 increased competition and forced health care providers to join these
 networks. Capitated payment plans based on per diem, per case, or 
per member per month (pmpm) rates also shift much of the financial
 risk to the providers of health care services. Thus, this decade 
has been marked by unprecedented competition and decreasing 
reimbursement rates.</p>

<P>What may appear as geographical inconsistencies in the progression
 of managed care is in reality the result of strategic MCO penetration
 into markets based upon population density and physician organization.
 HMOs have moved quickly through California and now into the metropolitan 
cities of the Northeast, Southeast and Midwest.  The spread of managed 
care throughout the majority of community and teaching hospitals seems 
inevitable.</p>

<p>Hospital institutions electing to play a reactive role to this 
phenomenon may very well find themselves victims in this era of ongoing
 consolidation and increased competition. As payers continue to compare
 the performance results of their member hospitals (e.g., procedural 
costs, complication rates, patient follow-up data and outcomes) against 
national data and norms, the health care provider is being forced to do 
more with less. Productivity enhancing technology has become increasingly
 strategic as we search for new ways to improve outcomes while further 
reducing the cost per patient visit.</p>

<B>Case Study: San Ramon Regional Medical Center</b>

<P>San Ramon Regional Medical Center (San Ramon, CA) is a 123-bed 
community hospital that is situated in one of the most advanced managed
 care regions of the nation, the highly competitive Stage III to Stage 
IV market serving the densely populated San Francisco Bay area.</p>

<P>Our goal is to be able to demonstrate that we can be a low cost 
provider of high quality surgical services. Our efforts to reduce 
costs have been focused primarily on the two most significant cost 
components in providing surgical services -- labor and materials. 
As part of this strategy, we have already implemented a computer 
information system that enables better scheduling and the detailed 
tracking of surgical case lengths, utilization and costs. We have 
put forward efforts to minimize procedure delays, cancellation rates
 and turnaround times. Our personnel have also taken a shift toward 
cross-trained teams to allow for increased flexibility. To help bring
 materials costs down, we are procuring supplies from an approved 
vendor base through negotiated agreements. </p>

<P>One of the surgical specialties that our institution is strategically
 focused on providing is minimally invasive surgery (MIS). With reduced 
patient stays, faster recovery times and high patient demand, the compelling 
clinical and economic benefits make MIS attractive to both ourselves and
 the payers.</p>

<P>To help us further position ourselves to win with MIS in managed care,
 we have elected to invest in a new technology having a relatively modest
 cost investment, the Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning 
(AESOP), manufactured by Computer Motion, Inc. (Goleta, CA). AESOP is a new
 device that automates the arduous human task of holding an endoscope with
 a computer-controlled, robotic positioning arm. This surgical robot is 
capable of maneuvering and positioning an endoscope under the direct control
 of the surgeon.</p>

<P>Our two years of experience with AESOP have demonstrated that the robotic
 arm is very safe, user friendly, and clinically effective.  Our surgeons 
report that the improved stability of the image and their ability to control 
the field of view significantly enhances the efficiency of their operating 
environment. Dr. Carlos Gracia, a general and vascular surgeon performing 
endoscopic surgery at our hospital stated, "I love it [AESOP]! …it has a 
precision that I can’t even duplicate when I’m holding the camera for 
someone else."</p>

<b>Reducing Surgical Case Time</b>

<P>Several studies including our own have documented a reduction in surgical 
case time resulting from the use of AESOP in a variety of procedures1,3,4. 
There are two strategic points to consider when overall surgical case time 
can be shortened. First, two operating room staff are "freed" to do other 
tasks for that duration. Some areas where staff time may be redirected include
 lunch relief, reducing overtime, optimizing marginal daily staffing, 
maximizing the use of surgical specialty teams, operating room turnaround, 
and attention to special projects.  Second, the OR suite becomes available 
sooner for the next procedure, and occasionally an additional procedure can 
be squeezed in without any additional staffing requirements. Together, these
 translate into more efficient scheduling and a decrease in staff hours per
 unit of surgical case time (productive hours per unit).</p>

<P>At our institution, an average of 40 endoscopic cases per month are 
performed where AESOP can be utilized. Two of our surgeons perform a 
relatively higher volume of these general surgery procedures and typically
 account for 25 of the 40 endoscopic procedures that utilize AESOP. Once
 these two physicians committed to using AESOP, the rate of utilization 
was as low as 63% (25 of 40 cases) and as high as 100% with the participation
 of additional surgeons.</p>

<P>With our experience, an OR suite can be freed for about 6 to 10 hours
 per month and OR staff can be freed due to shorter cases for 12 to 20 hours
 per month.  The following chart reflects the average reduction in surgical
 case times with the use of AESOP.</p>

<b>Return On Incremental Billings</b>

<P>Due to the regional differences in cost containment pressures, some 
facilities still operate in a largely fee-for-service (FFS) environment. 
FFS reimbursement rates will vary widely and depending on your region can
 be as high as 80 to 85%. However, these rates are on a decline and managed 
care payment plans are progressively gaining in popularity among health
 care payers.</p>

<P>The idea of shortening case times might threaten to decrease the revenues 
generated by billing FFS payers on a per-minute basis in the OR. In this 
situation, the administrator must carefully consider the nature of FFS revenue 
and the value of emerging early as the local low cost health care provider. 
The overall objective, however, should be to collect Return On Incremental 
Billings (ROIB) where possible, while continuously striving toward the ability
 to demonstrate a cost conscious approach to providing quality care.</P>

<P>Conservatively, a facility might charge $100 per case for the use of
 AESOP. Based on our average of 40 endoscopic cases per month and an ROIB
 of just 17%, the net return would range from $425 per month if AESOP were
 used in 63% of these cases to $680 per month if 100% utilization were 
achieved.</P>

<B>Progressing Toward "Solo" Surgery</B>

<P>"Solo" surgery refers to the presence of only one surgeon in the OR 
suite during a given procedure.  On a regional basis we have seen health 
care insurers significantly decrease their payments to the assistant surgeon, 
and many cases are now being done without an assistant. This has become 
common in several markets for laparoscopic cholecystectomy and laparoscopic 
herniorrhaphy procedures. It is often left up to the hospital’s OR facility
 to replace the assistant with one of their own staff. AESOP is able to 
fill this gap by lending the surgeon a hand with the scope.</P>

<P>In the more complex endoscopic procedures a second assistant is often 
required to hold the scope. This demand falls heavily on the hospital as 
well as on the individuals trying to provide a steady field of view for 
the surgeons.  Before AESOP, staff substitutions in these lengthy procedures
 were commonplace.  AESOP has allowed us to staff one less person and 
simultaneously provide a more efficient operating environment for our 
surgeons.</P>

<P>By substituting AESOP for a human scope holder, we have been able 
to free 34.5 to 54.8 hours per month of staff resources.  Furthermore, 
we were able to insure against encroachments on our staff as reimbursement
 rates plummeted.</P>

<P>The pressure to adapt "solo" surgery staffing models is typically
 inversely proportional to the level of FFS presence in a particular
 market.  Many facilities who still enjoy reasonable FFS reimbursement
 rates have not felt much pressure in this area.  Unfortunately, as a 
facility begins to experience the impact of managed care, pressure is 
likely to build to fill the shoes of the assistant surgeon who may no
 longer have an incentive to participate in certain cases. The chart 
below conceptualizes the relationship between reimbursement and 
staffing dynamics.</P>

<center><img src="graph3.jpg"></center>

<P>Despite the many changes we face in health care today, two factors 
remain constant: increasing competition and decreasing reimbursement
 rates. Our goal is to stay ahead of the predominant market forces by 
strategically taking a proactive stance. Rather than reacting to a 
falling ROIB, we began early by restructuring our staffing models, 
studying our costs and investing in productivity enhancement technology 
in anticipation of  these burdening market pressures.</P>

<B>The Cost of Productivity Enhancing Technology</B>

<P>The cost of productivity enhancing technology is best measured in 
terms of its impact on operational expenses. By using AESOP to automate
 the scope holding task, we were able to improve operative efficiency
 in the OR and get better mileage out of our surgical staff and facility 
resources. Through effective use of the OR suite and freed staff resources
 we were able to achieve a measurable reduction in our productive hours per
 unit from 5.55 to 5.33, resulting in a 4% decrease. The key factor to this
 accomplishment can be attributed to the successful conversion of increased 
productivity and freed resources into measurable improvements in marginal 
staffing, staffing for special projects and additional cases.</P>

<P>Our study results show an improvement in OR productivity and a positive 
budget impact measurable in hard dollars. Specifically, we were able to convert
 productivity improvements attributable to AESOP to a savings of 0.74 FTEs
 valued at $43,000 per year. Marginal reimbursement from payers for use of 
the system further generates approximately $6,000 per year in net revenue. 
Balanced against an AESOP rental cost of $1045 per month, these would represent
 an immediate return on investment of 391%. Based on the current purchase price
 of $44,900 for AESOP, a capital investment would be recovered in 11 months, 
and over 5 years an institution would realize financial benefits totaling over
 $200,000. We also estimate that, on a monthly basis, with an OR suite freed 
for close to 10 hours we can potentially add 3 to 4 cases without the need for
 additional staffing.  Our study results can be further summarized as follows.</P>

<b>Soft Dollar Impact</b>
<ul>
<li>OR suite freed for close to 10 hours per month with significant value to our institution.
<li>OR staff freed to accomplish more important tasks; allows nurses to focus on nursing.
<li>A 4% reduction in productive hours per unit.
<li>Very high surgeon satisfaction with AESOP.
<li>Potential to add 3 to 4 surgical cases per month without the need for additional staffing.
<li>A unique win-win situation where both the administrator and surgeons can benefit.
</ul>

<b>Hard Dollar Impact</b>
<ul>
<li>A 0.74 FTE reduction in marginal staffing having an annual recurring savings of $43,000.
<li>Based on an ROIB of just 17%, an annual $6000 net reimbursement can be collected.
<li>Together, these benefits stand to offset the cost of AESOP with a positive cash flow of $36,460 annually.
<li>Based on a $1045 monthly rental price, an immediate 391% return on investment can be realized.
<li>Pay back on a capital investment purchase of $44,900 can be achieved in 11 months.
<li>Based on the $44,900 purchase price, an institution with a similar case load and utilization rate would stand to gain over $200,000 over five years.
</ul>

<P>It may be more financially viable for some institutions to rent or lease than to 
purchase AESOP. AESOP can often be acquired using operational funds, thus avoiding a 
lengthy capital equipment approval cycle. Based on the monthly rental expense, the 
system cost can be broken down to an hourly rate.  When weighed against the value 
of improving the overall productivity of surgery, the decision to "hire" AESOP at 
$1.50 per hour was not difficult. Furthermore, the manufacturer’s service and 
upgrade program included with the device rental agreement protected our hospital
 against any rapidly evolving changes to the technology. The decision to rent or 
lease must be weighed against the value of purchasing AESOP, which may yield a better 
financial return in the long run.</P>

<b>Discussion: Embracing Change</B>

<P>AESOP is well suited for institutions taking a proactive stance in positioning 
themselves for the managed care marketplace. However, as with any new technology, 
especially one that changes a user’s operating basis, there will be a spectrum of
 acceptance. The innovators and early adopters in any group are quick to embrace
 new technologies that fit their vision of progress. The majority, however, may
 wait until there is a consensus of acceptance and the compelling reasons to use
 the technology are well defined. In the increasingly competitive health care 
environment, we need to continue to explore new types of technology as tools to 
help us maintain quality while lowering costs.</P>

<P>There is a learning curve with AESOP, thus users should not expect immediate
 benefits when first using the system. Typically, a surgeon can become comfortable
 with AESOP in one to five procedures.  Our experience has shown that if both 
surgeons and staff are open-minded and willing to embrace technological advances,
 they will overcome the learning curve and realize the wealth of benefits that 
the device has to offer.</P>
