<HR><B>Dr. Ravi Sandhu</B> has established a new <B><I>Laboratory for Information
Security Technology</I></B> (LIST), and serves as its Director. Mr. Soonam
Kahng is currently the laboratory administrator. <BR>
<BR>
LIST's mission is to provide dedicated computing and networking facilities
for experimental research in information security (INFOSEC). Experimental
INFOSEC research requires modification and enhancement of low-level system
software including the operating system kernel, operating system services
and network protocols at all layers. Such experimentation is not conducive
to simultaneous &quot;production&quot; use of the same facilities. Hence,
the importance of providing dedicated equipment for this purpose. <BR>
<BR>
LIST is a corporate internetwork in the miniature. Currently the LIST subnet
consists of SUN workstations and NCD X-terminals. Plans to incorporate Windows
NT, Novell, Windows 95 and Macintosh computers are in progress. <BR>
<BR>
LIST facilities are available to SITE Graduate Students for experimental
INFOSEC research. Students interested in using LIST equipment should contact
Dr. Sandhu (<A HREF="mailto:sandhu@isse.gmu.edu">sandhu@isse.gmu.edu</A>)
or Soonam Kahng (<A HREF="mailto:soonam@isse.gmu.edu">soonam@isse.gmu.edu</A>)
to discuss possible projects. <BR>
<BR>
LIST facilities are also available for joint projects with industrial partners.

Professor Sandhu has been elected Chairman of ACM's Special Interest Group
on Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC). SIGSAC recently (1993) launched
the highly successful <EM>ACM Conference on Computer and Communications
Security</EM>, giving itself a much needed annual flagship conference. Ravi
is looking for volunteers and suggestions on additional SIGSAC activities
(send him email at <A HREF="mailto:sandhu@isse.gmu.edu">sandhu@isse.gmu.edu</A>
).<BR>
