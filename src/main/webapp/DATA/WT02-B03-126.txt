</CENTER><P>The aim of the Gerson Therapy is always to heal
and restore people to a normal active life. We sometimes get
phone calls and information from some of these cured people
with wonderful stories that we need to share with our
readers. We should also like to stress that we love to hear
from you people out there after you have been well for some
time. Don't for a moment think that we are no longer
interested in your recovery. On the contrary, the longer you
are well, the more important and dramatic the story! Please
keep in touch and let us know.</P>
<P>One such wonderful success story is that of Nora K. of
North Liberty, Indiana. Just weeks from her 10th birthday,
she started to suffer from headaches, then vomiting. Her
mother took her for a CAT scan and a brain tumor was
discovered. She then was taken to the Riley Children's
Hospital in Indianapolis and was scheduled for surgery. The
surgeon removed what he could, but some of the tumor was too
close to a blood vessel and was only cauterized. This, of
course, left the door open to more tumor growth.
Subsequently, Nora went for yearly check-ups. When she was
13, an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) showed a recurrence.
The doctor said that at this point, he couldn't do anything,
&quot;the tumor wasn't big enough to operate&quot;. Nora's
mother, Mary, felt that she couldn't just sit by and wait for
her daughter's tumor to grow. She started to read and
research. She found the Gerson Therapy. </P>
<P>In 1990, Mary and Nora came to the Mexican hospital and
started the Gerson Therapy. Nora was on the Therapy,
strictly, for one and a half years. During this time, with
the frequent coffee enemas and juices, Nora did not go to a
public school, but had home schooling. She also spent a great
deal of time with coffee enemas on the bathroom floor. She
used this time constructively: she read all the classics she
could get her hands on, then she read Plato and other
philosophers, then she went on to read science books and
math. She got a tremendous education. When she took her
SAT's, she scored extremely high; on her State equivalency
test her score was almost perfect. With all her background
and reading, she also became an excellent writer. </P>
<P>At the end of her intensive Therapy, she had another
check-up with her neurosurgeon. He took some pictures,
studied them, was puzzled, hesitated, took some more pictures
- and finally said that he couldn't see any more tumor, just
a shadow which he felt was a scar. Nora's mother asked what
Nora's prognosis was. The surgeon said that she would never
have a problem again! Nora was also playing the violin. The
doctor was very pleased that she could play the violin and
this was a very good sign, since the type of tumor she was
suffering from would affect the fine motor skills. He said
that she would not be able to play the violin with a tumor in
her brain, these delicate motor skills would have been
disturbed.</P>
<P>After one and a half years on the strict Therapy, Nora
switched to a maintenance therapy: she was still taking 2 - 3
quarts of juice daily and eating organic food. Her mother
started an organic co-op business, helping to supply herself
and a number of other people in the area with organic food.
Mary K. says that she is now helping some 40 people to obtain
their organic produce. Nora is 19 years old, and has been
admitted to college. Not only that, but she obtained a
Presidential Scholarship, a very high honor, and hopes to
study medicine - alternative medicine - to help others as she
was helped.</P>
