<H3>MNR'S GOAL</H3>
To contribute to the environmental, social and economic well-being of Ontario through the sustainable development of natural resources.<P>
<H3>MNR'S OBJECTIVES</H3>
<UL>
<LI>To ensure the long-term health of ecosystems by protecting and conserving our valuable soil, aquatic resources, forest and wildlife resources as well as their biological foundations.
<LI>To ensure the continuing availability of natural resources for the long-term benefit of the people of Ontario; that is, to leave future generations a legacy of the natural wealth that we still enjoy today.
<LI>To protect natural heritage and biological features of provincial significance.
<LI>To protect human life, the resource base and physical property from the threats of forest fires, floods and erosion.
</UL>
This calls for an ecosystem-based approach to the management of Ontario's natural resources, with ecosystems defined to include the economic and social activities of humans as well as the natural environment.<P>
Since the essential attribute of healthly ecosystems is sustainability, MNR's goal can also be described as the maintenance of ecosystem health through the balancing of environmental, economic and social components.<P>
Fiscal constraints and rapid change are moving governments to concentrate on outcomes. The accountability of a ministry can be more clearly defined and systematically evaluated if these preferred results are clearly defined, priorities are more explicitly determined, and the contribution of various activities, functions and strategies are more rigorously assessed.<P>
<H3>BENEFITS</H3>
Accomplishing the above four objectives contributes to significant benefits in Ontario.<P>
<UL>
<LI>healthy natural ecosystems,
<LI>a healthy and safe natural environment for people,
<LI>resource based jobs,
<LI>community stability,
<LI>competitive, natural resource-based industries,
<LI>revenue to the Province,
<LI>outdoor recreation.
</UL><P>
MNR's contribution to each benefit varies across the province. Other government agencies and other sectors of society also contribute to these benefits.
