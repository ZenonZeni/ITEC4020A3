<P><STRONG>The evolution of global compensation strategies</STRONG></P>
<P>Until fairly recently, most multinational organisations compensated their employees around the world on a 'divide and conquer' 
basis:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Local nationals were compensated according to locally competitive practices.</LI>
<LI>Headquarters-country expatriates were typically compensated using the 'balance sheet' approach -- designed to 
maintain the expat's home-country standard of living.</LI>
</UL>
<P>So-called third-country nationals (TCNs) were generally also compensated under a home-country (or headquarters-country) 
balance sheet approach, depending on their status and the company's commitment to the balance sheet philosophy.</P>
<P>As a result, pay for local nationals, expats and TCNs varied widely -- even when these individuals had similar skills and 
training, filled similar roles at the same location and performed at comparable levels. For many years, such differentials posed 
no problem. Companies could justify their rich expat packages because of the valuable role expats played in disseminating the 
headquarters country's superior technological and operational know-how.</P>
<P>However, as multinational companies evolve into truly 'global' organisations, they leverage skills from many locations around 
the world and often have centres of operational and technological excellence outside the headquarters country. In filling key 
international posts, global companies increasingly look to global talent pools. In many instances, international operations are 
now managed by highly qualified local nationals who view headquarters transferees as no more valuable -- although more 
expensive under the balance sheet approach -- than other candidates.</P>
<P>What's more, expatriates' expectations differ markedly today from in the past. Where once expats viewed international 
assignments as short-term career interruptions, many now prize and actively pursue such assignments as critical to career 
advancement. And many no longer believe they can -- or should -- maintain a home-country lifestyle that's increasingly 
unaffordable for the company and can hinder integration into the local organisation and culture.</P>
<P><STRONG>The new wave</STRONG>. In view of these realities, many multinational companies are moving away from their traditional emphasis on 
home-country pay practices and creating programmes that more closely align compensation with today's global business 
needs and strategies. In these programmes, participation and remuneration levels depend more on the company's global 
reward strategy and an individual's level and role in the organisation than on local practices. Typically, for example:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Base salary for senior executives is set according to a worldwide pay structure designed to provide both flexibility and 
fairness. Base pay for middle management is keyed to a regional pay structure.</LI>
<LI>Short-term incentives are based on a combination of corporate, line of business, unit and/or individual performance, 
measured against well-defined objectives. Incentive opportunities are based primarily on role and level in the 
organisation and, at lower levels, are influenced by regional/local practices.</LI>
<LI>Long-term incentives for upper management increasingly follow worldwide guidelines, with adjustments for tax 
requirements in the country of residence.</LI>
<LI>Employer-provided benefits and perquisites are pegged to local practices, but guided by an overall executive benefit 
strategy. Highly mobile employees may participate in an international benefit programme.</LI>
<LI>The one-size-fits-all balance sheet method is giving way to an array of approaches for different categories of expats -- 
balanced by appropriate local and global reward strategies.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Ultimately, the more global the company, the less its executive remuneration programme is influenced by national borders. For 
senior management especially, global organisations are increasingly managing short- and long-term incentive programmes on 
an integrated worldwide basis, focusing on what works best to motivate employees to achieve business objectives.</P>
<P>And while compensation design and incentive plan participation will always be sensitive to tax and regulatory considerations, 
taxes (especially headquarters-country tax policies) are no longer the overriding concern. More and more, international pay 
packages are designed in the context of a broadly defined competitive global market, to emphasise the individual's economic 
value to the company and his or her performance.</P>

<H4>1996 federal budget impacts retirement and compensation</H4>
<P>Employers should review their retirement and compensation programmes in the wake of the new conservative government's 
first budget, which was announced on 20 August. The budget introduces measures that represent additional administrative and 
cost burdens for employers. However, it also reaffirmed employer-provided retirement income (known as superannuation) as 
the central pillar in the country's retirement savings system, together with the government's commitment to compulsory 
superannuation.</P>
<P>For the majority of superannuation fund members, the budget announcements will have only minor immediate impact. As 
expected, though, the government moved to address issues of perceived inequity -- specifically, the criticisms that 
superannuation has offered relatively greater, and unjustified, tax concessions to those on higher incomes. The key changes 
are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>A contributions tax surcharge on employer contributions to a superannuation fund will apply where an individual's total 
income, including deductible superannuation contributions, exceeds A$70,000. The surcharge reaches its full 15% 
when income reaches A$85,000. This is in addition to the existing contributions and benefits taxes. Details on how this 
will apply to defined benefit funds are to be advised. The proposed collection mechanism for the surcharge is complex 
and will increase costs for all funds, even those that have no members subject to the surcharge.</LI>
<LI>There will need to be additional tax payable on ex gratia payments and other unfunded benefits received by high income 
earners to align with the contributions tax surcharge. This will be based on service before and after 20 August 1996.</LI>
<LI>There are changes to standard contribution limits that determine the total maximum deductible superannuation 
contributions an employer can make. Employers may no longer use the standard contribution limit (of A$27,170 times 
number of employees) if they have ten or more employees. The more complicated and restrictive age-based calculation 
must now be used in respect of each employee to determine the maximum deductible contribution.</LI>
<LI>An 18% tax rebate for contributions of up to A$3,000 by an employee for his or her spouse will be available where the 
spouse's taxable income is below A$10,800.</LI>
<LI>Employees earning between A$450 and A$900 per month will be able to receive cash in lieu of Superannuation 
Guarantee (compulsory) contributions.</LI>
<LI>The government remains committed to the concept of compulsory employee contributions and matching government 
contributions, but the delivery mechanism has yet to be decided.</LI>
<LI>The government confirmed its commitment to permit various financial institutions to offer retirement savings accounts 
that will be capital guaranteed.</LI>
<LI>The age limit for superannuation contributions for employed persons has been raised from 65 to 70.</LI>
<LI>From 1 July 1997, there will be incentives to take out, or maintain, private health insurance. The incentive will take two 
forms:
<UL>
<LI>for low income individuals, couples or families -- a tax rebate or reduction in premiums for private health 
insurance</LI>
<LI>for single individuals with taxable incomes over A$50,000 and families with combined taxable incomes in excess 
of A$100,000 -- a Medicare levy surcharge (ie additional income tax) of 1% if they do not have private health 
cover.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The main implications of the above changes are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>increased administration for both fund administrators and employers</LI>
<LI>increased cost of providing defined benefits for high income earners</LI>
<LI>decrease in relative attractiveness of superannuation for high income earners; for people on high marginal tax rates, the 
tax benefit of superannuation compared with taxable salary has been reduced to a differential of approximately 7%</LI>
<LI>reduced scope for large contributions to accumulation funds on behalf of particular individuals</LI>
<LI>a probable move by many employers to salary packaging.</LI>

<H4>Pension law clarification raises new questions</H4>
<P>A ministerial circular letter, issued on 2 August 1996, was intended to complete and clarify the pension law of 6 April 1995 
(the Law Colla), and its subsequent Royal Decree of 10 January 1996. However, the letter also raises a range of new 
questions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>It is confirmed that only objective criteria can be used to determine categories of employees eligible for participation in 
a company pension plan. The Insurance Control Authorities will judge the acceptability of the adopted criteria. The 
circular letter indicates that distinctions based on seniority and the nature of the employment contract (permanent versus 
temporary) are acceptable. Distinctions based on age and, of course, gender will be rejected.</LI>
<LI>Plan participation has to be immediate for employees over age 25 and the probation period cannot be invoked to delay 
actual enrolment.</LI>
<LI>Although the decision to alter or suspend an existing plan is left to the discretion of the employer, the circular letter 
advises employers to obtain written consent from each individual participant or to formalise the decision by means of a 
collective labour agreement, to avoid plan changes being invoked as a cause of breach of the employment contract.</LI>
<LI>Vesting is immediate unless the plan rules include a vesting period of a maximum of one year with respect to 
employer-financed benefits. At termination, the employee has three options as to the delivery of the vested benefits:
<UL>
<LI>maintain deferred rights</LI>
<LI>transfer the accrued reserves to the pension plan of the new employer</LI>
<LI>transfer the accrued reserves to one of the institutions that administer extra-legal pensions in accordance with the 
provisions of the Royal Decree dated 14 May 1996.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The surrender option is no longer available, although this has encountered strong opposition from the pensions profession and 
therefore needs further clarification.</P>
<P>The circular letter raises many issues. The most important issue is that the pensions profession challenges its binding character 
in the light of the pre-existing legislation. However, while clarification is being sought, it is likely that outstanding controversial 
issues will find a natural and pragmatic solution as real case questions emerge.</P>

<H4>Pension funds bill announced</H4>
<P>Employers should review their current retirement policies and pension plans in the light of the draft pension funds bill 
announced at the end of August. The bill aims to put in place a framework for supplementary plans on top of social security 
and mandatory plans. It is currently being discussed in parliament at a time when the government is already under considerable 
pressure to tackle the issue of pensions. The main proposals for these supplementary plans are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>They are to be collective arrangements (as opposed to individual ones) with optional employee participation, put in 
place either unilaterally by the employer or by negotiation with employees.</LI>
<LI>Employer contributions to the plan, if any, have to be defined in the same way for all employees. They are limited to 
seven times employees' contribution.</LI>
<LI>Employer contributions will be tax-deductible.</LI>
<LI>Employee contributions will also be tax-deductible, but the limit is not known yet.</LI>
<LI>Funds can only be managed by insurance companies.</LI>
<LI>Employees will participate in investment decisions through a surveillance committee.</LI>
<LI>At retirement, the funds must be converted into a lifetime pension that may be reversionary.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following points are either unclear or contentious:</P>
<UL>
<LI>What will be the final tax treatment of contributions and investment income?</LI>
<LI>Will contributions and investment income incur social charges?</LI>
<LI>Will the insurance companies' monopoly on funds management be challenged?</LI>
<LI>Will a lump-sum option at retirement be added?</LI>

<H4>Tax changes affect expatriates' pension arrangements</H4>
<P>As a result of an amendment to Dutch tax law, it is now more difficult for foreign pension plans to qualify for tax relief in the 
Netherlands. Although the amended law still allows pension relief for individuals who transfer to the Netherlands, but remain in 
their home-country pension plan, it includes extra conditions that must be met if the homecountry pension plan is to be 
recognised for Dutch tax purposes.</P>
<P>Employees working in the Netherlands who belong to a Dutch pension plan are normally subject to Dutch income tax on their 
employer's contributions, and their own contributions (if any) will not be tax-deductible. However, on certain conditions, 
Dutch law currently provides exemption from these tax liabilities for expatriates who remain in their home-country plan on 
transfer to the Netherlands.</P>
<P>The existing conditions contained in Dutch law were:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The Dutch employer must contractually provide that the expatriate is covered under the home-country pension plan.</LI>
<LI>The tax relief (tax-free entitlements to pension and deductions of the contributions) of the home-country pension plan 
must not be more favourable than under an ordinary qualifying Dutch pension plan.</LI>
<LI>The tax treatment in the Netherlands must not be more favourable than in the home country.</LI>
<LI>The tax authorities in the home country must declare that:
<UL>
<LI>the home-country pension plan can be considered as a typical pension plan in the home country</LI>
<LI>the future pension benefits relating to the pension rights accumulated during temporary employment in the 
Netherlands will be taxed in the home country.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>A copy of the foreign pension plan documents should be submitted.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The following extra conditions have now been added:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Tax treaties between the Netherlands and home countries must allow, among other things, for the exchange of 
information.</LI>
<LI>The transfer to the Netherlands may not exceed a maximum period of five years.</LI>
<LI>The Dutch Insurance Chamber must approve the continuation of the foreign pension plan.</LI>
<LI>A copy of the employment contract should be submitted.</LI>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The application must include comparative details of the tax relief available in the home country and of that available to a 
Dutch employee in a similar position (including the pension formula and the pensionable salary on which pension is 
based).</LI>

<H4>New superannuation legislation enacted</H4>
<P>Employers should review their superannuation schemes in the light of two pieces of legislation that were rushed through 
parliament prior to the October election. The legislation concerns disclosure and whistle-blowing.</P>
<P><STRONG>Disclosure</STRONG>. This is of major concern to superannuation schemes since it requires them to provide new members with an 
investment statement and make a prospectus available to members on request. The investment statement requires a member 
to receive specific answers to 11 defined questions; its intention is to enable members to compare the benefits of their scheme 
with products such as unit trusts, life policies and other retail savings schemes. It will be relatively easy for trustees and 
employers to meet these requirements.</P>
<P>The more contentious aspect of the legislation is the prospectus, which is a more comprehensive document. In future, the 
regulatory authority will be the Securities Commission, which has wider and more onerous enforcement powers than the 
Government Actuary who is the current regulator. Although schemes will need to ensure that their prospectus receives proper 
legal, actuarial and audit sign-offs, they will also need to take a measured approach to avoid unnecessary expenditure.</P>
<P>The commencement date has yet to be announced, but it will not be later than 1 October 1997, with an initial transition period 
of six months.</P>
<P><STRONG>Whistle-blowing</STRONG>. This piece of legislation introduces the requirement for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>advisers and managers to disclose information to the Government Actuary if they become aware of a serious problem</LI>
<LI>an independent trustee to be appointed where an employer goes into receivership or liquidation and the employer is 
also a trustee of the superannuation scheme</LI>
<LI>members to receive on request information about the assumptions and basis for calculations in situations where they are 
asked to consider a proposed change to their scheme benefits, eg conversion from defined benefit to defined 
contribution.</LI>

<H4>Defined benefit pension plans under threat</H4>
<P>Employers who sponsor defined benefit pension or provident schemes are advised to assess carefully the position of these 
schemes in light of an increasingly hostile environment towards defined benefit arrangements. Those who have not yet adopted 
a defined contribution benefit philosophy may wish to re-evaluate their position. Issues of particular relevance include the 
following.</P>
<P><STRONG>Pension Funds Amendment Bill.</STRONG> This requires that all pension and provident schemes make allowance for members to elect 
at least 50% of the individuals making up the board of trustees of the scheme (see Headlines of December 1995). Pensioners 
of the scheme are considered as members. The actual election of member representatives can be delayed until December 
1998 for existing schemes, but thereafter a minimum of equal representation for members is obligatory.</P>
<P><STRONG>Labour Relations Act (LRA).</STRONG> The exact date of implementation of the LRA is unknown, but will probably be around 1 
October 1996. Its provisions require that any changes to the rules of an 'employer-controlled' benefit scheme be referred to a 
workplace forum for consultation (see Headlines of December 1995). Current interpretation of the Act indicates that all 
defined benefit schemes would effectively be employer-controlled, because (almost) all rules of such schemes contain 
provisions allowing the employer a veto over issues such as contribution rate increases, benefit enhancements and possibly 
investment decisions.</P>
<P><STRONG>Repatriation of surplus to an employer. </STRONG>Considerable uncertainty exists as to whether surplus can be repatriated to an 
employer and, if so, under what circumstances. Refunds of surplus have not traditionally been permitted, although some 
precedents for refunds do exist. The authorities do not have a clear position on this issue currently, although they are working 
towards establishing a definitive policy. Closed defined benefit schemes with meaningful surpluses are particularly affected by 
this uncertainty.</P>
<P><STRONG>Cost pressures. </STRONG>Increases in the cost of death and disability benefits (which traditionally form part of retirement benefit 
schemes) as a result of AIDS and other factors continue to cause concern. Many defined contribution funds have an overall 
cap on the employer contribution rate, thereby limiting the employer's liability. However, cost increases in defined benefit 
schemes will be borne by the employer unless benefits are restructured, which itself may prove difficult.</P>
<P>Similar considerations apply in respect of the 17% tax introduced earlier this year on portions of retirement benefit scheme 
investment income (see Headlines of April 1996). Benefit levels have not been adjusted to account for the tax (although the 
impact on defined contribution scheme members is direct), not least because the tax is seen as a temporary measure, the 
nature and level of which may change in the future.</P>
<P>As a result of the hostile environment, employers should consider adopting a defined contribution benefit provision philosophy 
and closing defined benefit schemes to new members, making use of contribution holidays (where appropriate), extending 
further options to employees to transfer from defined benefit to defined contribution arrangements, and purchasing appropriate 
annuities for pensioners.</P>

<H4>New company car tax proposed</H4>
<P>Under a proposal currently being considered by parliament, the imputed tax value of company cars will decrease, and private 
mileage will have to be paid by employees. However, business mileage will still be reimbursed by employers, and mileage 
between home and work may be tax-deductible.</P>
<P>The impact of the proposal on company car drivers will depend on:</P>
<UL>
<LI>whether they use their car mainly for business mileage (favoured by the new system) or private mileage (penalised by 
the new system)</LI>
<LI>how fuel-efficient the vehicle is.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Under the current system, company car owners are taxed on an imputed tax value based on a purchase price decided by the 
tax authority plus a percentage of the social security base amount. All maintenance costs and private mileage are typically paid 
by the employer.</P>
<P>If parliament votes in favour of the proposal, the new system will take effect from 1 January 1997.</P>

<H4>New pension accounting standard introduced</H4>
<P>A new pension accounting standard -- the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No 18 (SFAS No18) -- for pension 
plans and termination indemnities has been introduced with effect from 1 January 1996. Most Taiwanese pension plans are 
underfunded because of a weak minimum funding requirement and restrictive investment options. A typical pension plan will 
cost between 8% and 15% of salary; many employers actually contribute less than 4%. The purpose of the new standard is to 
provide a more meaningful comparison of pension cost and liabilities among employers and to help the plan sponsor to 
recognise the true cost of the benefits.</P>
<P>The introduction of the standard may therefore lead to:</P>
<UL>
<LI>increased funding, or</LI>
<LI>more flexible investment options.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The option of reducing plan benefits may not be available to the employer, since the Standard Labour Law mandates a 
minimum benefit.</P>

<H4>Surplus refund to be repaid with interest</H4>
<P>In the mid 1980s, Hillsdown acquired the FMC company, whose employees were members of a contributory final salary 
scheme -- the FMC scheme. This scheme had a substantial surplus of around 20 million. The rules of the FMC scheme 
expressly prohibited any repayment of assets to the employer.</P>
<P>Hillsdown persuaded the trustees to transfer all the assets and liabilities of the FMC scheme to another scheme (the HF 
scheme) in return for approximately 1 million of benefit improvements. The remaining surplus was then paid to Hillsdown from 
the HF scheme.</P>
<P>The Pensions Ombudsman found, and the Court of Appeal subsequently agreed, that the trustees were in breach of trust 
when they made the transfer to the HF scheme because they exercised the power to make a bulk transfer for a purpose -- to 
allow Hillsdown to take a refund -- other than the purpose for which it had been given. The Ombudsman ordered Hillsdown 
to repay the refund with interest.</P>
<P>This ruling demonstrates the need for trustees and employers to clearly understand their powers and obligations under a 
pension plan's governing trust deed and rules. While trustees and employers are right to be concerned, they should not be 
frightened into inaction. There are no reasons why, assuming all parties put comprehensive conduct of business rules in place 
and receive the appropriate advice, that future plan restructuring or amendments should not be successful.</P>

<P><a name="uk2"><STRONG>New minimum transfer regulations issued</STRONG></a></P>
<P>Recently issued transfer value regulations, which become effective on 6 April 1997, require that individual transfer values paid 
to pre-retirement leavers from defined benefit pension schemes are subject to a new statutory minimum. This minimum will be 
calculated using the prescribed assumptions that are used to determine the new minimum funding requirement (MFR). Transfer 
payment applications received before 6 April 1997 can be paid using the existing transfer value approach.</P>
<P>In addition, trustees will be required to receive written actuarial advice before deciding on the allowance in transfer values for 
discretionary benefits. This advice will need to be regularly reviewed by trustees.</P>
<P>The practical implications of these regulations are that:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Transfer values for some schemes will have to increase. The exact amount of the increase depends on the transfer basis 
currently used.</LI>
<LI>Trustees and employers will need to know before 6 April 1997 whether there are sufficient assets in the plan to cover 
the payment of these new transfer values.</LI>

<H4>New legislation makes wide changes in benefits law</H4>
<P>After many months of political wrangling, Congress and President Clinton have enacted several pieces of legislation with 
wide-ranging implications for employee benefits and compensation.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996</STRONG><I>.</I> This legislation which raises the federal minimum wage to US$5.15 per 
hour in two phases, also contains a 'pension simplification' package that modifies the qualified plan non-discrimination testing 
requirements and makes other changes designed to simplify the management of pension and 401(k) plans. For example, the 
law simplifies the definition of 'highly compensated employee' and allows employers who adopt new 'safe harbour' designs for 
their 401(k) plans to avoid certain non-discrimination testing altogether. The law also makes a number of changes in qualified 
plan distribution rules that will enable some highly paid employees to collect larger benefits if they retire within the next few 
years. These changes could bring a temporary increase in early retirements in the near term.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.</STRONG> This act will make health coverage more 'portable' for 
people with pre-existing medical conditions by imposing new restrictions on coverage limitations or exclusions for pre-existing 
conditions. The law also guarantees the availability and renewability of group health insurance coverage for all employers, 
regardless of claims experience. In addition, it clarifies or extends favourable tax treatment to an array of employer-sponsored 
welfare benefits, including long-term care insurance, so-called accelerated death benefits, employer-provided educational 
assistance programmes and adoption assistance. Note also that this new law phases out the tax-favoured status of interest on 
debt used to purchase company-owned life insurance (COLI).</P>
<P>Taken collectively, the assortment of relatively modest changes in US employee benefit law made by the new legislation adds 
up to a fairly significant package of plan design and compliance issues for employers to address. The retirement plan 
provisions, in particular, merit close examination to assess their impact on an organisation's current programmes and strategy.</P>
