KEEPING IN TOUCH: EMINENT MAIL

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Nobody talks of email these days. It is mostly a given for all of us
here in the IT world. DATAQUEST decided to see how corporate users are
taking to this area of communications. Some interesting findings
emerged. Read on:

Do you have email access for most employees?

Yes: 76%
No : 24%

Getting connected through computers is the done thing for more than
three quarters of the people surveyed. The next logical step could
easily be e-commerce. Digital cash? What makes email desirable?

Low cost   16%
Error free 44%
Fast       40%

Email is not sought out because of price factor alone. Corporates are
needing faster and faultless communication transmissions every day, and
that is clearly what email seems to mean to them.

Has Internet furthered email proliferation?

Yes   32%
No    20
Maybe 48%

Almost half the people surveyed are not very sure about the benefits of
the Internet. However, a third of users surveyed feel that the Internet
is a good thing for boosting email. Source: Tele-survey conducted in
Delhi by ESSKAY Enterprises.

KEEPING IN TOUCH: DATANUGGETS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Being in the business of journalism has its own pits ad falls.
Especially in the area of IT, with its heavily laden jargonesque.

Recently, there was this piece posted on the Net by some one who has
been afflicted by a spate of press releases from IT majors. A sample of
what is said and what it actually means:

Advanced design: Most of our own people don't have a clue on how it
works either; All new: Parts not interchangeable with existing models;
Automatic: You can not repair it yourself; and Breakthrough: We finally
figured out how to sell it. And talking of breakthroughs, there is this
little incident about the shades of reality at press meets. Recently, at
a gathering of press people recently, for the launch of a leading
company's telecom product, all the invitees were flummoxed. The reason
was that when the time came for the unveiling of the actual product,
there was so much light and smoke and sound that at the end of the whole
show a very strange, though expected, thing happened. Unable to witness
the product, or the video, or the presenters themselves, the august
assembly took recourse to the only enticement left. And that was the
profuse champagne on call. Quite a bubbly conference, it turned out to
be.

KEEPING IN TOUCH

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Many would be pardoned today to think that networks are now old hat.

There is hardly any office set up, regardless of size and complexity of
the operation, that does not have a network of sorts to boast of. And
with this kind of proliferation, small wonder then there is a
simultaneous rise in the requirement of the services of network
administrators and managers. The present book under review-- Novell's
Guide to NetWare 3.12 Networks--is an effort in the direction of
familairizing and guiding network managers and users on how to get the
best out of their systems. The book comes with a lot of easy references
called, Fast Track notes, which are very useful for any person who is
pressed for time and requires immediate help on the very pertinent
problem that he may have. Also, the book has all the necessary tutorials
to enable the setting up of the network, upgrading earlier ones and also
maintaining and troubleshooting indicators. The book has a systematic
sequencing of chapters and within each of these there are a lot of easy
references and text which the reader can understand as per the
requirements of the task at hand. Not confining itself to mere
technicalities, the book follows a reader friendly layout in its
treatment of the topic, and to this end has a lot of discussions on the
real life situations that one might face in the networked enterprise.

With topics like data passing schemes, network security, administering
techniques and the like, this guide to the Novell Network is a easy and
useful help book for the many IT stalwarts out there.

BANKING ON IT: JV SHETTY

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

After a fruitful career spanning various top management posts in banks
like UBI, CBI, JV Shetty recently retired as the CMD of Canara Bank. One
of the most technology-friendly banks in India, Canara Bank's deposits
are in the region of Rs 26,000 crore, with a net profit of Rs 250 crore.

A techno-savvy banker, Shetty recently appointed as Director of the
Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS), an autonomous body with
the Governor of RBI as its Chairman. This body--which conducts
recruitment test for the banking sector and attests almost 40 lakh
people every year--the world's largest testing organization. Shetty
spoke to Latha Kuttappan and Sindhu Raj of DATAQUEST on a variety of
topics related to IT and banking. Excerpts:

In your new capacity, you are going to push for computerization in
Indian banks using the same as you did in Canara Bank?

I can do it in my individual capacity. However, it will be the
prerogative of the banks to draw up their plans. I certainly believe
that it is the level of technology that decides who is going to be the
leader tomorrow. So, it is in the interest of the banks to take IT
seriously.

How did computerization in Canara Bank come about?

The bank already had introduced computerization and traditional Advanced
Ledger Posting Machines (ALPMs) which used outdated PCs and obsolete
technology. But now, we are only going in for state-of-the-art
technology. When our largest branch (Delhi, Parliament street) was
automated, the software was developed by the Canara Bank team and
Infosys. What we developed there was for 132 activities. Banks abroad
have limited operations. So the software developed by foreign companies
take a long time to customize and runs into problems. As a result you
loose the lead time in overtaking competitors.

When will Canara Bank go online with live transactions?

Bangalore and Delhi are already operational. We are waiting for P
Chidambaram, Finance Minister, who has agreed to inaugurate the first
networked public sector bank. We have introduced CashPoints (ATMs) as a
part of our customer service scheme. Out of 80 branches in Bangalore, if
10 can be put up as ATMs, it will be good. Since major frauds have taken
place, it is better to go on a pilot basis and develop a good audit
system first.

Many banks are complaining about lack of funds for computerization. Is
this true?

I don't see why banks should complain about lack of funds. It is a
question of investments and returns. One can't wait for returns first.

For those banks that are running at a loss, the World Bank has come
forward to finance for technical upgradation programs.

Where do Indian banks stand in compared to foreign banks?

Indian Banks will definitely catch up. In terms of marketing,
competency, expertise, and a variety of other functional abilities, we
are second to none. What we lack is motivation and training. Our front
desk has poor customer service. We are developing a new scheme where we
intend putting well-trained and well-informed probationary officers at
the front desk. In addition to this, if an attitudinal change sets in,
other banks will not be able to match us. Our advantage lies in physical
presence. We are in almost all districts with 2,200 branches spread
across the country. Our deposit base is more stable and dependable than
foreign banks. The key area in the future, I believe, is treasury
management. The niche areas for the twenty-first century will be
investment, training, forex, and project appraisals.

VIGNETTE SPOTLIGHT: NEELAM DHAWAN, VP (DISTRIBUTION), TISL

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

In an industry where changing jobs has become more the rule than the
exception, Neelam Dhawan stands out as an exemplanary exception. The
lady has moved after spending 14 long years in HCL HP, where she was GM
(Marketing), to TISL as VP (Distribution). This is the first job change
she has made after joining HCL straight from college in 1982. This
sudden move came after she was tipped to take over as the head of HCL
Global Alliances, the newly formed HCL Group entity.

Born and brought up in Delhi, Dhawan did her schooling from Convent of
Jesus and Mary, and then went on to secure her degree in economics from
St Stephens College. Armed with a Management degree from Delhi
University's Faculty of Management Studies, she failed to find favour
with Hindustan Lever and Asian Paints as they refused to take women in
marketing. Not willing to settle for the post of a "glorified clerk," as
her brother called the job offer she received from ANZ Grindlays, she
joined HCL.

After training, she was made incharge of the northern region sales where
she remained till 1985. Next, she took over as the Assistant Product
Manager and became a part of the team which was directly involved in the
launch of Busybee systems. In 1995, she became the GM (Marketing).

Despite enormous work pressure, Dhawan prefers a slow pace of life. She
loves travelling, and dreams of going on a world tour, "an undefined
holiday" as she puts it, once she retires. She also plans to resume her
work in Mother Teresa's orphanage where she used to go and help during
her college days. But at the moment, with two young daughters and the
demands of her new job, she still has a lot more to accomplish before
she can even think of retirement.

THE THEORY OF INCREASING RETURNS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Everybody seems to be praising it, but it is imperative that we examine
the drawbacks of this system.

Economists have a theory of diminishing returns which essentially means
that the more you sell the harder it gets. In the software development
field, something that is the exact anti-thesis of this principle is at
work. Dubbed the theory of increasing returns, this essentially states
that the more you sell, the easier it gets.

This theory has been much acclaimed by many people who sadly fail to
realize that this is not exactly praiseworthy because it rests on two
crutches--virtual monopolies and forced standards--and a crutch, no
matter how powerful, is unsightly. About the only good effect it has is
that it acts as an aphrodisiac for established players who control the
industry.

If you care to examine matters in detail, you will realize that it is
not technology but the virtual monopoly of players like Microsoft that
forms the bedrock of the industry. This virtual monopoly is achieved by
forcing standards on the user and the developer industry, and ensuring
that over a period of time they are generally tied down to that
standard.

I do not grudge the apparent advantage that companies like Microsoft,
Netscape, and Sun have due to their clout in the OS/applications,
browser market, and Internet development market respectively. What I'm
worried about is the fact that this sort of a virtual monopoly cripples
technological advances. Thanks to the success of Win95, the penetration
of Mac has been curbed and most users will never realize its powers.

Another problem is that this also ties people to standards. The
dominance of Win95 essentially means that users and developers will find
that it is impossible to migrate to some other platform like the Mac. In
addition to this, developers are forced to develop for a particular
platform because it is more prominent. Some may claim that a variant of
Darwin's survival of the fittest theory is at work, but the point I'm
trying to make is that the fittest product is perhaps not the best for
the user.

The monopoly and standards issue hurts everybody, even its very
proponents. For example, Win95 would have been a much stable product had
it been engineered from the ground up, like Windows NT. But sadly,
Microsoft was tied to its own outdated DOS and Win 3.1 standards, and
because of this, in spite of its best efforts, Win95 falls short of the
mark.

The Increasing returns theory rests on two crutches, Virtual
monopoly and forced standards

RoyalEDGE

Tell me now, do you still find the theory of increasing returns
laudable? Shouldn't something like the software industry, which drives
all our lives to a large extent today, and is expected to form the
foundation of living in the near future, be based on better principles?

Should we worship a principle that ties us down to the shoddiness of the
past, curbs innovation, and forces users and developers alike?

No. Because the increasing returns theory is the shame of our realm. The
relationship between this theory and the software industry is similar to
the relationship between a junkie and his heroin--he may praise it for
the high and the happiness it provides, but it is a crutch,
nevertheless.

Dr RoyalE has a PhD from SHINE--The Sherlock Holmes Institute for Noble
Eminence.

reported a net profit of $ 62 million, down by 17 percent compared to
the same period last year. The company's unit sales, however, rose by 26
percent during the same time reflecting an immense fall in margins. The
company has also announced a tie-up with IBM for the manufacture of the
Big Blue's PCs as an OEM supplier. This move could boost revenues for
the second half as well as shore up the falling bottomline.

DATA STOCKSTOCK MARKET UPDATE (22 AUGUST-7 SEPTEMBER)

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

The bearish mood of the markets failed to be substantially affected by
the expectations of some sops for the capital markets from the Finance
Minister. The markets which closed at 3406 on 21 August rose by just 102
points to reach 3508 at the end of business hours on 6 September. The US
attack on Iraq and fears of higher oil prices in India also affected the
sentiments. Due to Telecom Scam involving the former Communication
Minister Sukh Ram, the political scenario was also disquieting while
CMIE reported that industrial production grew by only 5 percent in the
first quarter of 1996-97 as compared to a healthy growth of 23 percent
in the corresponding quarter last year. The World Bank's fears of slower
growth in India due to infrastructural bottlenecks, and some
recommendations by FIIs in key counters like SBI also dampened this
response. Whether the current upward move will withstand some of the
negative news filtering into the markets remains to be seen in the
coming weeks. Chances of this, however, remain dim in the current
context in any case, the market is likely to come down in the near
future.

IT stocks were reasonably stable and some stocks like HCL HP and Zenith
gained ground. Mastek reported a poor year with a relatively slow sales
growth of 33 percent to reach 28.79 crore. Profitability was a casualty
led by lower margins on operations and higher interest costs. PAT was in
fact lower by nearly 4 percent despite the growth in sales over the
previous year and stood at a little over Rs 4 crore. Post results
announcement, the share quotes at its 52 week low. PCL's results were
also not very heartening. For the six-month period ended 30 June, PCL
reported sales of 297.20 crore, up 29 percent from the previous period.

Operating margins were down by 0.7 percent from the previous period's
8.8 percent. PAT was Rs 15.75 crore, up only 19 percent over the last
half's figure. The top losers were Mastek, Digital World, and Nexus
Software. Major gainers included Hinditron Informatics, Zenith
Computers, and International Computers.

UNIX ABOUND: A REPORT ON THE SCO FORUM 96

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

A report on the SCO Forum 96--one of the most popular Unix events in the
world. Held at the UCSC campus, it had its fair share of fun and
business.

It was a veritable treat. Set amidst the verdant redwood trees at the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) campus, it was a Unix feast
that lasted for five Californian summer days. Santa Cruz Operation Inc.,
(SCO) celebrated its tenth annual Unix event, SCO Forum 96, this year.

Hosted by SCO, the event was part-sponsored by leading IT companies like
Intel, IBM, Oracle, Compaq, and Unisys. The event was attended by over
2000 people: developers, resellers, OEMs, consultants, academicians, and
the press from all over the world who had converged at the campus to
exchange notes on the trends in the Unix world in particular, and the IT
industry in general. The best of minds met here and discussed the future
of the computing industry.

A host of luminaries delivered the keynote speeches at the Quarry'
sessions in the morning. They included Alok Mohan, President and CEO,
SCO; Doug Michels, Executive VP, Chief Technology Officer, and Founder,
SCO; Dick Watts, VP and GM HP, and the irrepressible Scott McNealy,
President and CEO, Sun Microsystems. McNealy's presence was intriguing
to many, since Sun Microsystems is SCO's arch rival in the Unix market.

But then the event was for the Unix industry as a whole. Nevertheless,
Scott chose to give his own reasons. A Top 10:

10. They wanted somebody to do a Top 10 list.

9.  Takeover rumors are always good for the stock price. (The conference
    was rife with rumors that Sun has been courting SCO, which analysts
    dismissed.)

8.  Because Bill Gates (of Microsoft) wouldn't let Lew Platt (of
    Hewlett-Packard) speak.

7.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

6.  SCO stands for Sun Collaboration Opportunity.

5.  Santa Cruz can always use more Sun.

4.  Because Bill Gates wouldn't speak free.

3.  No other CEO would speak without AV support or demos.

2.  The road to Santa Cruz leads through Scott's Valley.

1.  It's Java stupid.

A Network Computer (NC) debate titled Will The Network Computer Break
the Windows Monopoly?' was held. One of the most influential computer
journalists in America, David Coursey, hosted the event and the
participants were Hermasn Hauser, Founder of Acorn Computer and Chairman
of NChannel, Philippe Kahn, Co-founder and Chairman of Starfish
Software, Zvi Alon, President and CEO of NetManage Inc., and Philip
Johnson, Director of Server Operating Environments at IDC. Kahn and
Hauser argued in favor of the network computer. After a heated debate,
the wind blew in favour of network computing and the impact of Internet
on the computing model.

In addition to the debate, a special NC pavilion was set up for
developers to display their information appliances'. More than a dozen
NC makers, including Sun Microsystems, HDS, Wyse Technology, and Diba
displayed their NCs for the first time in public.

Parallel conference sessions were held in three streams: Engineering,
systems administration, and business. These sessions included everything
from developing Windows-friendly client server applications to selling
better Internet solutions talks on the internals of Gemini (SCO's
next-generation Unix systems project).

Free Unix

In a move that empowers students, educators, and Unix system enthusiasts
with free access to the world's most popular business computing
environment, SCO announced plans to provide a free license to use its
popular Unix systems, including SCO OpenServer and SCO UnixWare to
anyone in the world who wants to use them for educational purposes and
understanding of Unix systems. The bold move has far-reaching
implications for the future of Unix platform and marks the public debut
of SCO's stewardship of the Unix system.

Mohan said, "This is only the second time in Unix's 25-year history that
the owner of the technology has made this offer. The last time this
happened, a $ 60-billion industry was born."

The Unix system was in its infancy when AT&T Bell Labs gave it free to
colleges and universities to help R&D projects. Soon, thousands of
students learnt to program on Unix systems. After graduation, they took
their knowledge into the corporate world, building a $ 60-billion
industry. The legacy of AT&T's gift to universities includes the
Internet, WWW, multiprocessing, and much more. "SCO believes it is time
to return the favor," said Mohan, "and deliver the result of more than
20 years of technical innovation back to educators and students
worldwide."

Road To Next-generation Unix

SCO has developed a comprehensive roadmap and product strategy for Unix
system users and developers to quickly and easily leverage the
advancements that SCO is making for small, medium, and enterprise-class
environments. The SCO Gemini project is the cornerstone of this
activity. Gemini' is the code-name of a SCO engineering project that
will deliver next-generation Unix systems from the company. Gemini' is
the consolidation of the SCO Openserver and SCO Unixware product lines
with significant enhancements to meet the demands for a new generation
of distributed computing environment. It is also the SCO platform which
will provide the easiest path to 3-Dimensional Architecture (3DA)--the
forthcoming 64-bit Unix system being co-developed by SCO and HP for the
Intel Merced processor.

The Unix system technology being jointly developed by HP and SCO will
encompass a common set of APIs and will serve as the basis or engine'
for the next-generation Unix operating environments that will be offered
by the two companies. Optimized for the Intel IA 64-bit Merced
microprocessor and based on an advanced 3DA, the Unix system will
provide a single development and porting target for 32-bit and 64-bit
applications, enabling OEMs and ISVs to accelerate their delivery of a
wide range of innovative customer solutions.

Moving forward aggressively with their joint development agenda, HP and
SCO announced the availability of the initial API specification of their
next-generation 64/32-bit Unix systems for review by strategic software
developers and systems suppliers. Ensuring that the customers can take
advantage of advanced 32-bit and 64-bit computing is a priority for both
companies.

Endorsements And Partnerships

There were a series of vendor endorsement announcements and strategic
partnerships. IBM announced support for SCO Internet strategy by
delivering its DB2 database for the SCO OpenServer platform ahead of
schedule. IBM also announced that its Net.Data product will beta this
month providing interactive Web access from the SCO OpenServer platform
to many data sources.

IBM Net.Data delivers Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) to data stored
in both IBM and other databases, enabling users on the Internet and
intranet to access a variety of data sources with any Web browser.

In an industry first, Oracle and SCO demonstrated Oracle7 Parallel
Server running the SCO Unixware 2.1 system across Intel-processor-based
hardware servers. The hardware cluster included servers from Compaq,
Digital, IBM, and Unisys, communicating with the same Oracle7 database
residing on a CLARiiON disk array. The demonstration holds significance
since it was the first time a fail-over' high-performance cluster
solution running on Intel-processor-based hardware from numerous vendors
was shown to be a viable solution.

"Only SCO Unixware and Oracle7 Parallel Server can transparently combine
systems from different hardware manufactures into a single, high
availability cluster," said Mike Shelton, SCO's VP, Enterprise
Solutions. "This is a compelling example of SCO Unixware providing a
unified operating system for Intel-based systems," he said.

Propelled by a series of major developments, SCO Unixware continued its
fast-track into the enterprise marketplace. In four months, leading
computer companies (Compaq, Data General, Fujitsu, Intel, NCR, Olivetti,
Siemens Nixdorf, Unisys) and ISVs established SCO Unixware as the Unix
operating system of choice for Intel-processor-based volume enterprise
servers. Newer OEMs are committing to shipping SCO Unixware with their
enterprise servers. SCO calls this the Big E Initiative.

These vendors can focus more resources on developing value-added
technologies and more innovative solutions. ISVs benefit because they
can create a single binary source code for multiple hardware platforms.

This enables them to dramatically cut their development costs while
providing their customers with a clear path to the future. The reduced
R&D costs will enable greater innovation and strengthen the entire
enterprise computing market. Among these ISVs are PeopleSoft, Micro
Focus, Tivoli, Oracle, and IBM.

SCO has formed development partnerships for Gemini. These partnerships
include an alliance between SCO, Data General, ICL, and HAL to provide
ccNUMA (cache coherent Non-Uniform Memory Architecture) capability and
price/performance. SCO has also formed a strategic relationship with
Unisys that includes cooperative development to build large system
scalability and capability for Unixware.

SCO continues to gain momentum in the middleware software segment. Some
of the products now available with SCO Unixware include transaction
processing software from NCR (Top End), BEA Systems (Tuxedo), and SNI
(OpenUTM). Additionally, Unisys and SNI are providing their mainframe
communication suites. Finally, leading-edge Object Request Brokers
(ORBs) are also available from ICL (DAIS) and IONA Technologies (Orbix).

Internet Strategy And NC/OS

SCO announced addition of new components to the SCO Internet Family,
featuring the availability of Netscape's FastTrack Server, the Oracle
WebServer, the Oracle PowerBrowser, standalone PPP from Morning Star
Technologies, the Internet-ready version of SCO TermVision, and the
recently unveiled SCO Network Client/Operating System (NC/OS) product.

In addition, SCO outlined its plans for the new components slated for
version 2.0 of the SCO Internet Family.

SCO also announced the immediate OEM availability of its NC/OS, the
first low cost, small footprint software designed specifically to
provide OEMs with a reliable, time-to-market solution for developing NCs
on standard Intel-processor-based hardware.

The SCO NC/OS technology combines a small 1.5 MB footprint Unix
operating system, TCP/IP networking, with Netscape Navigator client
software, and Java software to provide an open NC operating system that
can run on Intel hardware. Building on its expertise in Unix operating
systems, communication, and Internet technology, SCO is working with
industry leaders to provide this client solution for networked end-users
to access their intranet, Internet, and enterprise applications.

Client Integration

Setting the agenda for the Windows to Unix system integration market,
SCO unveiled three new members of the SCO Vision family--SCO VisionFS,
SCO XVision Eclipse, and SCO SQL/Retriever 4. The new cross-platform
products strengthen SCO's commitment to its Windows integration
strategy, enabling organizations to fully utilize the power and
reliability of Unix servers without sacrificing their investments in
Windows PCs. In addition to being re-engineered for 32-bit platforms,
the SCO Vision family is now geared to meet the demands of mobile users
and to cut costs of managing large groups of PCs. New, reduced prices
provide users a cost-effective solution for integrating Windows PCs to
Unix servers.

The move to provide free Unix licenses for educational, non-professional
use, highlights SCO's aggressive stewardship of the Unix system
technology. SCO's goals for the Unix systems are to deliver into a
dramatically higher-volume market for all Unix customers; extend the
lead in enterprise-class and Small and Medium Business (SMB)
environments through advances in technology; provide SCO customers,
OEMs, and ISVs with a direct path to next-generation Unix Systems; and
extend the expertise in key innovative areas such as Internet, intranet,
Windows-to-Unix integration, and minicomputer RAS capabilities.

DATA VANE: SAMSUNG DEVELOPS 14" TFT-LCD MONITOR

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Samsung Electronics has announced that they have completed development
of a 14-inch thin-film transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD)
monitor that can replace the conventional cathode-ray-type (CRT). Until
now, the use of TFT-LCDs has been restricted to notebooks and medical
imaging machines, but technology advances have resulted in later
versions with very high picture quality.

The new TFT-LCD monitor weighs only 3 kilograms, one tenth the weight of
an average CRT monitor. It is only 5 cm thick, which means it can be
installed in much smaller space than the conventional monitors. This
feature alone is expected to help revolutionize the office of the
future.

SEC's recent R&D success puts the company's LCD technology on a par with
the world's best. The new monitor offers a maximum definition of 1,024 x
768, the same picture quality as a 17-inch CRT monitor. It features
SEC's unique multisync digital graphics processor, which can support
both VGA (640x480) and Super VGA (800x600) systems. The TFT-LCD monitor
can be directly connected, without the need of a separate graphics card,
to PCs now using a CRT monitor.

Brightness is 25 percent more than in a CRT monitor, a major improvement
over other notebook screens. The lightness-darkness ratio is 300:1, and
the device can reproduce 260,000 different color shades. Because of
these features, the new 14-inch TFT-LCD monitor by SEC is expected to
occupy a leading position in the next-generation flat display market.

DATA VANE: NOVELL INTRODUCES INTRANETWARE

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Novell Inc. has announced IntranetWare, a new product that continues the
evolution of NetWare into a full-service intranet and Internet access
platform for business of all sizes. IntranetWare builds on the
distributed service found in NetWare 4.11 (code-named Green River) and
integrates new intranet and Internet technologies, including a
high-performance Web server and browser, a gateway between the
industry-standard TCP/IP and IPX/SPX networking protocols, and a
multiprotocol router for wide-area network and Internet connections.

IntranetWare will ship in the fall of 1996 in the same time frame as the
separately available NetWare 4.11.

IntranetWare, along with network applications such as Novell's GroupWise
email and collaboration solution and ManageWise network management
software, provides business with a scalable, secure, and reliable
full-service intranet solution. IntranetWare will enable NetWare
customers to preserve their existing network investment while evolving
their business network to embrace Internet technology and the benefits
of intranets.

IntranetWare enables customers to choose how and when they change their
corporate networks to intranets, by allowing them to selectively install
those networking components that meet their immediate requirements.

IntranetWare is fully compatible with NetWare 4 servers, applications
and hardware, enabling users to upgrade their existing networks to
networks that embrace Internet technology. Novell will focus on the
IntranetWare platform and distributed network services in the future,
but continue to sell and provide full support for NetWare 4 and NetWare
3.

DATA VANE: AUTODESK DEVELOPS VISUAL EFFECTS FOR THE CRAFT

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Using PC animation tools from Kinetix, Autodesk Inc.'s multimedia
business unit, special effects innovators at Sony Pictures ImageWorks
created groundbreaking special effects in Columbia Pictures' The Craft a
supernatural thriller about four girls exploring their inner power
through witchcraft.

Led by visual effects producer Suzanne Paster and visual effects
supervisor Kelley Ray, the crew turned to PCs running 3D Studio, a
popular 3D animation and modeling packages from Kinetix. The result was
the first visual effects sequence to integrate filmed actors with photo
realistic 3D animation created entirely on. In this sequence, hundreds
of Monarch butterflies flutter around the four main characters. Special
effects created with 3D Studio have appeared in such major motion
pictures as Johnny Mnemonic and Virtuosity.

DATA VANE: SRAM MODULE TO FEATURE BUILT-IN BATTERY MONITOR & CPU

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Dallas Semiconductor has announced a new line of surface-mount NV SRAM
modules that feature a built-in battery monitor, built-in CPU reset, and
reduced power consumption. Initial DS13-Series products include the
DS1330 (32k x 8), DS1345 (128k x 8) and DS1350 (512k x 8). Each DS13xx
module contains a sophisticated battery monitor that periodically checks
the voltage of the module's internal lithium battery.

The DS13-Series products offer 10 years of data retention at 25 degrees
Celsius. Companies building products with service lives greater than 10
years can now design their systems to keep close tabs on remaining
battery capacity over the years.

Manufacturers building products intended for high-temperature
environments, where data-retention life can be substantially less than
10 years, will likewise benefit from using a DS13-Series NV SRAM. In
addition to the battery monitor, the DS13-Series devices have a built-in
CPU reset function that serves as both a power-on reset during system
power-up and a power-fail reset during system power-down.

The New Era computer dictionary bundles together several features not
normally found in electronic dictionaries like a card slot that accepts
electronic books, a second slot for a database extension that accepts
handwritten input through a PDA panel and electronically records the
spoken word to allow users to check their pronunciation against correct
standard speech generated by Lernout & Hauspie technology.

A BROAD VISION, INDEED

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

BroadVision may help provide a good boost to e-commerce--and probably
extend it.

Napoleon had said that an army marches on its stomach. Similarly, a
corporation marches on its sales people who maintain contact with
customers on a regular basis and perform the vital task of ensuring that
products are sold--for, after all has been said and done, it is not
technology but personal relationships that help foster growth.

Till now, technology was not of much help, except probably in helping
you print labels for a direct marketing exercise or to help you look
through a database that has a few marketing statistics. But now a
company called BroadVision <http://www.broadvision.com> is helping
provide what marketing gurus have always known to be of
essence--contact, and a one-to-one relationship.

BroadVision's application system--called One-To-One--is less an
application system and more a marketing philosophy based on the strategy
described by Don Peppers and Martha Rogers in the book The One-To-One
Future. This marketing philosophy is extensively centered around the
customer--it actually helps provide some sense to the much misused
statement the customer is king--and revolves entirely around his
preferences, likes, and dislikes.

The beauty of the whole thing is that BroadVision has realized the most
important factor--the human factor--in pushing a product. While most
people are arguing about the viability of e-commerce and determining the
drivers for ensuring its success like security considerations,
BroadVision has placed e-commerce where it rightfully belongs--at the
bottom of the chain. As the BroadVision FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
guide puts it, expecting to profit from making e-commerce a reality is
similar to expecting to turning in good business merely by buying a new
cash register. A medium for facilitating active transactions is what is
called for instead of merely a medium that ensures that you can pay
without paper money or a cheque book.

To understand the real difference BroadVision makes both to the merchant
and the buyer, consider a scenario in which a hypothetical dress
merchant has a web site which can be used by websurfers to view the
latest apparels. People will login nineteen to a dozen and go through
the various clothes on display, and probably decide to buy some of them.

While the shop owner has a way of determining which goods move faster
than the others by consulting his books, he has no way of knowing who
prefers what. He is forced to provide exactly the same interface to
every person simply because he does not have any idea about that
individual's preferences.

Now, assume that he had BroadVision. This empowers him with the ability
to determine what a particular user prefers and then providing him with
an interface that is restricted to his context. For example, if a
particular person normally picks up only jeans and T-shirts, he can be
presented with an interface that only offers details about jeans and
T-shirts. This provides greater focus both to the vendor and the user or
buyer. This gives the user a strange sense of belonging, simply because
his preferences are recognized, and this, in turn, psychologically
affects the buying decision.

Further refinement is also possible. For example, if a person
essentially prefers to buy blue denims in the price range of Rs
1,000-1,500, he can be intimated about fresh stock as and when it
arrives. The shop owner can also keep track of the number of items that
have been purchased by a particular person and offer him a good discount
because he has just bought his twentieth shirt this year. This helps
further customer loyalty. Essentially, this scenario is the foundation
stone of the one-to-one philosophy which believes that a great business
is built one customer at a time and each customer is crucial to the
success of an enterprise. BroadVision's philosophy is indeed a welcome
extension to the concept of tailor-made solutions.

One thing to note in this case is that e-commerce is not exactly a
necessity because payment can be made on receipt of goods, though, of
course, it would have been helpful to an extent. But understanding your
customer and his needs, as always, is. Come to think of it, it is really
amazing what a little rule-based reasoning can do. BroadVision, which
already uses rule-based reasoning is contemplating licensing a
personalization algorithm from Firefly, a company which uses such an
algorithm to identify user trends and personal tastes.

This idea is indeed a good one, but one item that could mar it is the
issue of privacy, an issue that most people take quite seriously--for
example, a computer consultant in Oregon paid the state $ 222 for its
complete motor vehicles data base, which he then posted to a Web site,
prompting charges of privacy violations from people who complained that
he had invaded their privacy because anybody can trace, from an Oregon
number plate, the vehicle owner's name, address, birth date, driver's
license number, and title information. But BroadVision's philosophy
mirrors what Professor Anne Wells Branscomb mentions in her book Who
Owns Information--consumers will be willing to provide information about
themselves provided they get something in return for that information.

And in this case, after providing his personal information, the person
does get something in return, namely an environment that is tailored to
his needs.

Surely, this would have pleased Napoleon.

BALAJI N in Bangalore

Expecting to profit from making e-commerce a reality is similar to
expecting to turning in good business merely by buying a new cash
register.

CORPORATE COMPUTING - ROLLING OUT WITH IT

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

By Our Correspondent in Delhi

Apollo Tyres Ltd (ATL) was set up in 1977-78. As the manufacturing
technology--based on guidance from General Cars of USA--was not suitable
for Indian roads, the company went into red and incurred cumulative
losses of Rs 27.80 crore in 1982. Two years later, the company wiped out
its accumulated losses and recorded a profit of Rs 57 lakh. Since then,
ATL has never looked back. In the fiscal year 1990-91, the company
registered a turnover of Rs 190 crore. Growing six-fold, the company
added Rs 1200 crore to its kitty by 1995-96. This turnaround--largely
due to the vision of the Chairman and MD, Onkar Singh Kanwar--was
accompanied with significant improvements and investments in the usage
and adoption of IT.

The Technology Roadmap

In the last two years, ATL underwent massive restructuring. The main
objective of the radical transition was to use information as a tool for
decision-making. Besides, with the increase in corporate size, it wanted
information technology to address certain business needs. Primary among
them being increasing competition, rising customer expectations,
reducing scrap and rework, economizing on the cost of production, and
improving process capability and yield. While doing all this,
cost-effectiveness still remained the buzzword.

Jumping Onto The Client Server Bandwagon

Initially, the use of IT was minimal. It was restricted to payroll
systems, accounting packages, and store management systems. All the
locations were equipped with single-user PCs which were used on the
batch processing mode. The software was developed in-house on Foxpro
with Oracle as the RDBMS.

But as the company grew, so did the needs. To successfully address these
needs, it was important that information was integrated. To whit, the
sales and the production department had to be synergized, thereby
developing an enterprise-wide network. And for the same, climbing onto
the client server bus seemed to be the wisest thing to do. Instead of
developing the system in-house, the company acquired MARSHAL, the
Enterprise Management System (EMS) from Madras-based Ramco Systems Ltd
on the Windows NT, Windows SQL server platform. "We realized software
development was not our forte and hence getting a standard package would
save much of our time and effort," says Ashok Kumar Wahi, General
Manager (Information Systems and Human Resources), ATL. The company
chose MARSHAL over the internationally acclaimed EMS packages from SAP,
Baan, and Avalon due to its cost-effectiveness and rich features.

This system is being implemented in three phases. In the first phase,
accounts payable, human resources and payroll, general ledger, and
purchase and inventory have been integrated. In the second phase, which
would be complete by the end of April 1997, Supply Purchase Control
(SPC) and Supply Quality Control (SQC), production, and maintenance
management systems would be integrated. In the third and the final
phase, the rest of the modules like fixed assets, management accounting,
and sales will be integrated.

Preceding the integration of the modules, a business analyst surveyed
the company's operations and outlined the business needs which had to be
addressed by information technology. These included identification of
the training requirements, installation of the base product, master data
creation, development and testing of product extensions, trial run
module wise, and the integration and installation of the product
extensions. "When all the modules have been integrated, a trial run of
the EMS would be performed," informs Wahi. Today, everything in the
company has been standardized on the Windows platform. "We are a total
Windows company," says Wahi. The company also uses MS Office for Office
Automation and MS Mail for groupware.

Communicating For Better Integration

For better integration of information, it was important that the various
locations of the company were also connected. The company's network
consists of its manufacturing locations in Perambra and Kalamassery in
Cochin, Limda in Gujarat, and a recently opened plant in Pune. Besides
these manufacturing locations, the marketing network consists of four
zonal marketing offices located in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, and
Calcutta. All these zonal offices together govern the working of the 100
marketing locations of the company. The Head Office (HO) and the various
offices within Delhi also had to be brought under the communications
network. Far as Roi is conecerned, as compared to quantitative returns,
qualitative returns have been more

To achieve connectivity while being cost-effective, the company decided
to adopt a simple model under which only their prime locations are on a
WAN. Their five offices, including their HO in Delhi, boasts of 20 to
50-node LAN connectivity, while the factories at Baroda and Cochin claim
75-node connectivity each. Further, all these locations have been
connected by a 64 Kbps leased line from DoT. Besides these, the Pune
factory enjoys a 20-node connectivity.

The Marketing Network

While the production side and the offices in Delhi are equipped with a
WAN, the same is not true for the marketing locations of the company. It
is interesting to note that the marketing function, which can benefit
most from a WAN, is devoid of this facility in ATL. The four zonal
offices have five-node LAN connectivity each, while the 100 marketing
offices around the country still operate with single-user PCs. These
locations use the dial-up formula equipped with modems for connecting to
their zonal and head offices. "Our product being a non-perishable
product, promptness in this segment is not required," justifies Wahi.

Besides in the eight locations where ICnet is available, connection from
the ICnet has been acquired. While the locations operate on basic stock
accounting packages, the logistics have been centralized at the HO and a
daily report from each of the locations is sent to the HO.

On the hardware front, while the Proliant 5000 servers form the backbone
of the network, at the front-end they are still operating on 486/DX2
machines from Compaq, Dell, and Acer. To save on costs, the company
re-installed their existing 286 and 386 machines into their marketing
locations all across the country.

The Shop Floor Scene

IT deployment and penetration does not confine itself to post-production
but to the pre-market cycles as well. An efficient, across the board IT
usage has to be worked out from the bottom up.

All efforts of the company would have been of no avail, if the use of IT
had not been extended to the shop floor. To this end, ATL went in for an
extension of the restructuring paradigm, right down to the shop floor.

Here, besides the EMS, the factories utilize certain packages specific
to tyre manufacturing. Typical to any manufacturing industry, the use of
IT at the shop-floor level starts from the use of a process control
system. This means that the very innards of the system--be it design,
testing, or prototyping--have to be attuned to the corporate philosophy.

One of the most important aspect of tyre manufacturing is the design.

The product portfolio of the company contains an assortment of tyres for
passenger cars, heavy vehicle like trucks and tractors, two wheelers,
and even animal-driven vehicles. The sheer variety and profusion of the
is an inventory controller's nightmare. In ATL, each tyre is designed
using the Finite Element Analysis package. This helps in bringing out
workable and relevant decisions along-with the entire bill of materials
and the process support, all at the click of a button, and with enough
accurate details to satisfy the most demanding of customers and the most
fluid of markets. To further add value to the data collected, this
system has been interfaced with the help of MARSHAL for maintenance
management. The data collected serves as a record for preventive
maintenance management and calculating the mean time between failures.

All this is intended to manage maintenance and not merely control it.

Dividends From IT

The massive restructuring has been accrued with an investment of Rs 4.02
crore. But what has been the return on investment for the company? "As
far as return on investment is concerned, as compared to the
quantitative returns, the qualitative returns have been more," says
Wahi. In qualitative terms, the implementation of MARSHAL has resulted
in better co-ordination and streamlining of the activities between
far-flung plants and the HO. With the communication system in place, the
HO is well-informed of the daily stock situation in the factories and
plants.

The company has also been able to reduce the inventory cycle time.

Another benefit which ATL has accrued consequent to reengineering has
been the flexibility, adaptability, and quickness in operations, as
access to all relevant information has made quick decision-making
possible. Today, strategies are validated and deployed across the entire
company, instead of in small pockets. Besides, simultaneous updation of
information has helped ATL employees to take decisions based on present
events and not on past records. At ATL, information is being used more
as a decision-making tool rather than a management tool.

Apart from these qualitative benefits, the most significant and visible
quantitative benefit has been in terms of reduced claims on batches. The
company has managed to reduce its claims to less than half a percent.

Claims are vital to a tyre manufacturing company as high claims on
batches can at times wipe out the entire profit. However, now with the
EMS in place, it has become easier to trace the defect and the
explanation for the same.

Plans On The Anvil

The action does not end here. Though, the existing communication network
suits the current communication needs of the company, to meet the future
needs, it has worked out an extensive communications network. The
implementation of this network would not only connect its remaining
factories, but would also cover the sales depots. With this, the company
will achieve better transparency across their factories and marketing
locations. Keeping up with the current trend, the company plans to equip
its employees with notebooks. Besides, ATL plans to have an Internet
server and install a video-conferencing system. The specifications for
the same and the plan of action have not been worked out as they are not
for the near future. "Though still a dream, it would not be long before
they are realized," asserts Wahi. And going by the track record of this
company, that may well be true in more than one way.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: SAP OPENS NEW GATES ON THE INTERNET

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

SAP announced new versions of its R/3 software (3.1 by YE96, 4.0 by
YE97) and a business framework architecture. As a whole, these releases
are primarily marketing/development initiatives. However, 3.1 is an
Internet release providing users `open' entrance to SAP. Moreover, we
note SAP is moving toward a MSFT-centric strategy, employing MSFT's ITS,
IIS, and Explorer. As 4.0 will be unveiled late in 1997, we expect the
ability to distribute separate R/3 components, and significant added
functionality, particularly for retail organizations; this will further
challenge PeopleSoft, Oracle et al.

Bottomline: SAP's more defined Internet statement of direction will bear
fruit for users by 4Q97,

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: ORBS ON THE WEB: STRANGE EMBEDDED FELLOWS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

The complexity of Web-based applications will increase dramatically as
users integrate Java applets, OLE/ActiveX components, and back-end
services for `Live Web' applications. We believe this provides an
opportunity for ORB vendors, whose strength has been distributed
heterogeneous computing environments. However, because ORBs still lack
the services (transaction integrity, TP monitors, scalability, etc)
required for mainstream adoption, ORB functionality will be bundled into
packages, tools, etc., with proprietary extensions.

Bottomline: While ORB vendors provide messaging services that facilitate
OO-based distributed computing, the necessary services required for
large-scale adoption will not exist for at least 2 years.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: BORLAND SCALES UP WITH OEC

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Borland announced it would acquire Open Environment Corp. (OEM) for
about $ 65M. OEC's products, like the Entera high-end RPC-based
middleware and tools, will complement Borland's tool suite (Delphi,
Latte, and C++). With appropriate integration, Borland could offer
comprehensive products, enabling developers to scale from low-end C/S to
high-end applications. There are integration and management challenges
in merging the companies, but ultimately we believe the combination will
be attractive. Despite a cutthroat market with PowerBuilder 5 and Visual
Basic 5 (4Q) purporting to scale, and Forte, et al. pressuring from the
high-end. Borland is well positioned, combining an accessible front-end
with a proven, scalable back end.

Bottomline: The matching of Borland and OEQ will produce good
integration and distribution, challenging high-end and low-end C/S
tools.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: IBI'S FUSION: OUT OF FOCUS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Information Builders Inc. (IBI) steps into the multinational database
market with Fusion. While Fusion offers competitive features, it is not
likely to succeed outside of the EDA/SQL installed base. Indeed, we
believe the primary motivation of IBI is to stem attrition of its
clients to vendors such as Red Brick, Arbor, and Oracle. To make Fusion
successful, IBI must focus on developing industry-specific applications,
broadening its VAR channels, and re-tooling its skill sets to provide
Fusion integration services.

Bottomline: Fusion will be primary an installed base play, unless IBI
can aggressively deliver industry-specific applications through stronger
VAR relationships.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: NETSCAPE GETS 'PROFESSIONAL' WITH HP

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

A key component of last week's HP and Netscape (NSCP) products/sales
announcement is services. NSCP is playing catch-up in the corporate
messaging and groupware market, and while other recent announcements
(mail, directory, certificate authority) have addressed enterprise
products' shortcomings, NSCP lacks services for larger corporate
customers. Now, NSCP can leverage HP's Professional Services
Organization to comfort corporations worried about supporting,
implementing, and managing NSCP products. Another level of partnering
promises HP OpenView management of NSCP servers; leveraging this
effectively, HP could challenge Tivoli and CA solutions for Internet and
intranet management.

Bottomline: Although many details must be clarified, the services and
management coupling between HP and NSCP has a strong potential for
success.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: NETWORK INTEROPERABILITY TRIUMVIRATE

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

3Com, Bay Networks, and IBM jointly announced a network interoperability
alliance, focussed on emerging LAN/ATM switching standards (eg.,
integrated P-NNI, zero-hop routing. 802. 1Q VLANs). While implying
rudimentary interoperable solutions in heterogeneous environments
composed of these vendors, we believe users will ultimately realize
greater functional value with single-vendor backbone solutions. The
complexity of combining multiple vendors, coupled with the historic
failure of network industry partnerships to sustain long-term
collaborations (eg., Cisco/Synoptics, IBM/Chipcom), makes us skeptical
that this alliance will bear fruit.

Bottomline: Despite industry alliances' promotion of interoperable, open
solutions, users should plan on selecting a strategic vendor for
scalable switching infrastructures. However, conclusive decisions should
be delayed 9-12 months, when product delivery enables real-world
evaluations.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: NAVIGATOR WITHOUT A RUDDER?

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

In the Netscape vs Explorer browser battle, MSFT is rapidly gaining
strength as Explorer reaches technical parity with Navigator. As MSFT
embeds explorer in its OSes during the next 18 months, Navigator will
decline as a serious contender within NT and Windows intranet
environments. Netscape will be `boxed' into heterogeneous environments
and the Internet, as a delivery platform for Netscape-specific
applications. MSFT's edge will be its aggressive ActiveX push,
distribution channel, and development tool availability, as well as the
rapid movement to NT Server (and ultimately to IIS).

Bottomline: MSFT's OS-embedded Explorer strategy, supported by IIS,
ActiveX, as well as many ISVs and package vendors, will make Explorer
the browser standard for MSFT-oriented intranet environments.

WHAT'S NEW ON THE USER FRONT: A MODELING TRIO FOR SAP

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

SAP recently extended its business process modelling directions and
engaged the support of three partners: Prof. Scheer (Aris), Intellicorp
(LiveModel), and Visio (Business Modeler). Aris offer a business process
modeling tool, supporting (near future) multiple-package vendors. It is
positioned best for `green field' BPR projects involving legacy systems.

LiveModel is SAP-specific and is most appropriate in SAP-centric
projects. Its key differentiation is support for animated walkthroughs
of `to be' designs, triggering R/3 screens and transactions. Visio is a
lower-end graphics/flowcharting tool for communicating `to be' designs
(developed with Aris or LiveModel) to a brand business audience.

Bottomline: Given SAP's recent investment in Intellicorp (14 percent
ownership), we expect LiveModel to quickly become the leading
SAP-specific product.

JUNK E-MAIL: GARBAGE IN - AND IN AND IN

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

An explosion of junk email threatens to overwhelm the Net.

When CompuServe Inc. subscribers found their electronic mailboxes
stuffed with ads last fall, the online service warned the sender--
Philadelphia-based Cyber Promotions Inc.--to stop or face a
lawsuit. The parties disagree on what happened next, but the junk email
is still coming. And Cyber Promotions President Sanford Wallace isn't a
bit apologetic: "You're doing something the whole Internet world is
telling you not to do, but we've been doing it quite successfully."
How true. Cyber Promotions says it mails up to 3 million messages and
advertisements per day for companies selling everything from videos to
vitamins (table). And that's just the start. Nobody can say precisely
how big junk email is, but Internet experts agree that the volume will
soar as more marketers discover how cheap it is. A mailing to 1 million
people would cost about $ 827,000, including postage and printing, the
Direct Marketing Assn. says. Internet advertisers can reach the same
number for the price of a local phone call plus a few hundred dollars
for time spent online.

Backlash

Even as marketers catch on to junk email, they face a backlash. Net
surfers already complain about unwanted messages, and Internet service
providers grouse that they aren't being adequately compensated. Even
some pioneers of junk email concede that there's a risk that zillions of
free and other marketing messages could overwhelm the Net. "It could be
a serious problem to the efficiency of the Internet," says Neil Albala
of Tucson, who developed a so-called bulk email loader called Floodgate
for Windows.

Like other junk-mail programs, Floodgate lets an ordinary PC blast
messages to email addresses sniffed out from online directories, World
Wide Web sites, and electronic bulletin boards. For marketers who don't
want to operate junk-mail systems themselves, services such as Cyber
Promotions will send the ads for them. A few of these services block
adult ads, but most will mail whatever a client wants.

What can consumers do to avoid the onslaught? There is no legal
prohibition against the practice, but in the Internet community the
related practice of blanketing message boards--known as spamming'--is
dealt with by cyber vigilantes. Spammers are flamed'--vilified in reply
mail. Likewise, technically-savvy email targets can turn the tables on
mailers by deluging them with thousands of flame-mail messages or by
sending email bombs' containing huge files that tie up computers for
hours. But these measures hurt service providers worse than the junk
emailers, who wind up hopping from system to system--or develop their
own domains.

Perhaps most troubling for Internet users, junk emailers are
increasingly adept at targeting them by gleaming personal information
from the Net. For example, purveyors of quack remedies might grab the
online addresses of participants in health-related newsgroups, some of
which attempt to be as private and sensitive as support groups.

The rapid expansion of targeted junk email worries privacy advocates.
"If you lack adequate privacy safeguards, you could anticipate Internet
meltdown," says Electronic Privacy Information Center Director Marc
Rotenberg. But it's unlikely that the federal government will step in to
mandate protections. Federal Trade Commission Credit Practices Associate
Director David Medine says he doesn't favor government involvement in
the issue, saying that "regulation stifles development."

Fighting Back

For now, the FTC is working with two industry groups--the Direct
Marketing Assn. and Interactive Services Assn.--on guidelines to protect
privacy in targeted emailings. "The rules are being written as we go,"
admits Interactive Services Assn. spokeswoman Sara Fitzgerald.

Irate Internet surfers are also beginning to fight software with
software. James Howard, a University of North Carolina student, is
creating a program to block unsolicited email. Says Howard: "We think
there should be technical solutions so you don't get it if you don't
want it." If such blocking systems spread, consumers and service
providers might finally be able to shut out this cyber-annoyance.

INTERNET PHONES STILL ON THE MARKET

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Marketing agents continue to push the Internet phone, declared illegal
by VSNL.

The Internet phone is making news. It allows a realtime chat between
Internet users and at the same offers voice-grade communication at an
inexpensive rate. An Internet phone call can be made with the caller
logging on to the Internet through an access provider. Both, the caller
and receiver have to be logged into the Internet and it is imperative
that both users have the identical software. The additional components
needed, apart from the PC and modem, are a sound blaster card, a
microphone, and a speaker.

Once hooked on to the Net, one can access Internet Phone facilities
provided free by over 30 companies worldwide. Initial access to the
Internet is still made over local phone lines in the dial-up mode. After
this, the call travels over the computer networks that make up the
Internet. The caller's voice travels as bits of data which are sent out
in pieces or packets to various switches and then pieced back together
at the other end of the call. The Internet call costs Rs 30 an hour,
which is much cheaper than an ISD or STD dial-up charge. Though the
Internet phone appears to be very convenient, it has some inherent
limitations.

To establish an Internet phone connection, both users must have the same
software and also be logged in at the same time. Further, the
transmission quality on these lines is very poor, almost one-fourth that
of normal lines. It is difficult to receive the communication clearly.

Moreover, transmission/reception delays are due to the slow speed of the
line.

Not every PC can have an access to Internet phone. To be able to avail
this facility, the PC must have multimedia facilities. In the West,
where the Internet culture is much more pervasive, virtually all users
will have access to the popular Internet phone facilities, but in India
this is not possible.

But this is not VSNL's main worry. VSNL is anxious that the Internet
phone will hit its ISD revenues which is its bread and butter. Hence, it
has gone ahead and banned this service in India. According to Amitabh
Kumar, Director (Operations), VSNL, "This service is not allowed in
India. To offer the Internet service, a person needs a licence. Anyone
found offering the Internet phone service will have his licence
suspended. In fact, when a person is contracted as an agent, he has to
sign an agreement which states that he will neither use or provide the
facility for voice."

Inspite of the fact that Internet phone service is banned, many
marketing agents are still selling the registration for Internet phone
services at Rs 34,000. And the main bait they use to entice customers is
the cost of the phone call which they claim is to the tune of just Re 1
for five minutes.

There are quite a few vendors who are poised to sell Internet phones and
have advertised so. Mumbai-based VocalCall which was to sell VocalTec's
Internet phones in India, had to postpone its product launch. According
to Rajnikant Parekh, Director, VocalCall, "For the time being, we have
decided not to go ahead with our plans. What VSNL has done is good if we
consider it from the Government's point of view. But can VSNL stop the
use of Internet phones? I don't think VSNL can monitor all lines,
especially the TCP/IP lines. Internet phone calls are definitely being
made." In fact, VocalCall inserted an article about its product in a
newspaper about two months ago and so far it has received more than 600
enquiries. This only goes to show that a market exists for the product.

As the popularity of the Internet increases, usage of the Internet phone
too is bound to increase. Says Vijay Mukhi, founder member of the
Internet Users Club of India, "As the number of Internetters increase,
users of the Net's telephone facilities will also proliferate. Then VSNL
will certainly have a reason to worry." And worried VSNL indeed is.

SILICON VALLEY: ROOTING FOR BILL

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

As the American economy goes through a phase of rapid growth, Silicon
Valley has announced its support for Bill Clinton.

In 1992, the endorsement of some 25 leading Silicon Valley high-tech
executives, many of them staunch Republicans, played a key role in
putting Bill Clinton into the White House. In subsequent years, Clinton
has managed to alienate himself from many of his high-tech allies. But
following a month of heavy lobbying, including several meetings with
Silicon Valley leaders, a group of 75 executives announced their support
for the President.

Clinton and Vice President Al Gore video-conferenced from the White
House to a reception in their honor at Adobe Systems to personally
accept the endorsements.Venture capitalist John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins
Caufield & Byers, a Republican, told Clinton and Gore that their group
supports the Administration on positions ranging from jobs and the
economy, to foreign trade and open markets, research and development,
and education and training.

Doerr was one of the 25 original executives supporting Clinton in 1995.
Almost all of them reaffirmed their support for the Democratic ticket.
Less than a year ago, that possibility had seemed remote, particularly
after Clinton vetoed a bill that would have made it far tougher for
lawyers to file shareholder lawsuits.

Clinton told the executives that he is the candidate with a vision of
the future, as opposed to Bob Dole who sees the past as the best model
for tomorrow. "We need this election to be a referendum on the future.

People need to vote for the future. They need to vote for their family's
future, their children's future, their nation's future," Clinton said.

"You don't even have any idea the kind of appeal that your voice has to
Americans all over this country who see you as our leaders in the march
to the future. And if we can make this election a referendum on the
future, I have no doubt how it will come out," he said.

Asked why the conservative executives had rejected Dole, Adobe CEO John
Warnock, said, "From the Republican convention we heard a lot of
backward thinking, looking into the past and reminiscing about good old
times. In high-technology, we look at the future. We don't look at the
past."

The group of 75 executives included Paul Allaire, CEO of Xerox; Carol
Bartz, CEO of Autodesk; Steve Jobs, CEO of Next and Pixar Animation
Studios; Bill Hambrecht, CEO of Hambrecht and Quist; Ed McCracken, CEO
of Silicon Graphics; and John Young, retired CEO of HP.

Steve Jobs, never shy about sharing the spotlight at a major event, took
the opportunity to tell Clinton that Silicon Valley business leaders
traditionally reject government handouts or special tax credits.

Instead, the high tech business community looks for "a solid business
climate, based on economic policies that make sense. We all feel that
we've had that over the last four years and what we're looking for is
for that to continue for another four years. I've lived in Silicon
Valley since I was five years old, and the past four years have been the
best Silicon Valley has ever had in terms of growth in revenue, jobs,
international market share and just sheer momentum," said Jobs.

Bob Dole is not without some Silicon Valley high-tech supporters
himself. TJ Rodgers of Cypress Semiconductor has already endorsed Dole,
and additional support could come from Gil Amelio of Apple, Jim Morgan
of Applied Materials, Jerry Sanders of Advanced Micro Devices, and
Gordon Moore of Intel. Under Clinton, the budget has seen four years of
deficit reductions, the creation of 10.4 million new jobs, and a stock
market that has added more than 2000 points.

COMPUTER ASSOCIATION: ASSOCIATING MORE STRONGLY

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

As a part of its Asian thrust, Computer Association is taking a fresh
look at the Indian opportunities.

Despite being amongst the top three independent software companies in
the world, not many IT users in India know about Computer Associates
(CA). Enterprise-management solutions and mission-critical applications
are the two areas that CA is best known for. With very few users having
implemented enterprise management solutions in India, it comes as no
surprise that CA is not a well-known brand name here compared to
companies like Microsoft, Oracle etc.

In its twenty-first year of operations, CA currently has over 9,000
employees and a family of 500 software products. For the year ended
March 1996, it posted a revenue of $ 3.5 billion and a net income of
over $ 75 million. Contributing to this growth has been the Asian region
and according to Chua Tock Ling, Senior VP, CA Asia, the growth in the
Asian region is the fastest in CA. Within Asia, attention was first laid
on the Chinese market. "We have invested a lot of time, efforts, and
resources developing, in the last year, in North Asia (China, and to
some extent Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea) which are all fast-growing
markets," adds Tock Ling.

During the latter part of this year, CA is expected to announce its
plans for South Asia, in which India is the key market. In India, the
company has been having some discussions with various people about how
it can do business in India. Says Sanjay Kumar, President and COO, CA,
"We are comfortable with what is happening in India and we have worked
out some pretty aggressive plans which we will be announcing soon." What
seems to be on the cards is the enhancing of its direct presence by
opening a liaison office in Mumbai or Bangalore in the next three
months.

CA's entry into the Indian market was an indirect one. In 1993, it
acquired a company called Nantucket whose product Clipper was being sold
in India initially by Peutronics and later by Infosys. This trend
continued with CA's acquisition of The ASK Group in 1994, whose product,
Ingress, was being distributed by Mastek. Subsequently, approaching the
market in a more direct manner, CA appointed L&T in end 1994 as its
distributor for Unicenter, which has been the key product for CA so far.

This year, CA appointed its fourth partner, SE Business Solutions for
distributing its business application software.

Bulk of CA's revenue from India has been through the sale of Ingres
which is estimated to have brought in Rs 11 crore in 1995-96. Commenting
on Mastek's performance, Low Gee Sing, Manager (Asia Channels), opined,
"Mastek has been doing a good job and customers are satisfied." Ingres
has not been amongst the best-sellers in the RDBMS market worldwide and
the situation in India is no different. IDC (India) estimates that the
market share of Ingres dropped 4 percentage points to 14 percent in
1995-96, and in its outlook for 1996-97 feels that prospects for Ingres
are not very upbeat. Ravindra Govil, CEO, Mastek, says that the
immediate objective is to regain the market share and more
optimistically feels that beating Oracle is doable, albeit difficult. On
a more global scale, Gee Sing feels that Open Ingres is technically a
solid product and is being used in mission-critical applications.

However, he concedes that the product has not done well on the marketing
aspect and that it does not have enough visibility and mindshare.

CA-Unicenter, the enterprise management solution of CA has been the
primary catalyst for the company's growth since its introduction in
1993. According to Yogesh Gupta, Senior VP (Product Strategy), CA,
"Since its inception, Unicenter has been the fastest-growing product in
the history of software. In calender 1995, Unicenter revenues were $ 500
million. This year, Wall Street expects us to almost double that." But
this "billion dollar potential" software product has less than five
users in India. Gee Sing says, "India is very different from a lot of
other countries. The concept of systems management is pretty alien." One
of the primary reasons for CA's lackluster performance with Unicenter in
India is because of the lack of the mainframe culture to any significant
extent. CA has its task cut out in making its prospects understand that
systems management is equally important in the client server and Unix
environments.

Considering the market share that CA enjoys in many of the developed
countries, its revenue from India are perhaps far below its expectation.

When asked if CA's partners in India have not been particularly strong,
a hesitant Tock Ling says, "I wouldn't put it that they are not
particularly strong. It is a matter of focus, and I think if you put
your mind to develop a brand name and to market and organize your sales
and support forces into developing that brand, then I think we will do a
better job." In any case, that is the prime reason why CA believes that
it needs to have a direct presence in India to develop the market and to
assist partners.

Reiterating this stance is Kumar who says, "We have always been a direct
company and we will continue a direct presence anywhere we go. It is
very important for us." In other words, even if CA works through a
partner, the company would like to have a CA person ultimately
accountable for the solutions that it implements. However, for the kind
of software that CA sells, the company may require more direct
involvement in India than what is currently under consideration. This is
especially relevant for the distributed client server, automated
production control, security control and audit, performance management,
and accounting solutions etc. that CA has to offer.

OLD BOOK, NEW JACKET

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

The recommendations of the Ramani Panel regarding software exports has
nothing new to offer.

With software exports touching Rs 2,300 crore in 1995-96, the Indian
software exports industry is emerging as a unique and profitable forex
earner for the Government of India. Therefore, the initiative taken by
the DoE to prepare a general outlay of plans for the ninth five year
plan (1997-2002) in consultation with IT industry veterans is not
surprising. A panel of experts comprising 14 members from the IT
industry, academic institutes and the DoE was formed under the
chairmanship of KV Ramani, VP, NASSCOM, early this year. Started in
March, the study was completed and the report delivered to DoE recently.

It reviews the present industry, projects Indian software exports for
the next five years, examines the weaknesses in the software sector, and
identifies the thrust areas.

The Ramani Panel report however, has its limitations. It is like the
economic theory of demand and supply which postulates that demand goes
up when supply comes down, given the assumption that everything else is
equal. The report states that software exports from India, growing at a
CAGR of 42.6 percent, could touch Rs 21,800 crore by year 2002--an
eight-fold increase--provided all the recommendations are implemented.

Says Ramani "We could get a 7 percent share of the global software
market." In the event that only 60 percent of the recommendations get
implemented then exports would be in the region of Rs 12,680 crore. The
CAGR in this case is assumed to be 28 percent. Just as assuming that
economic conditions--which are rarely ever stable much less equal--as
being equal is wrong, to assume the probability of all recommendations
being implemented is also wrong.

Though long overdue, given that the last report on the software industry
was compiled in 1992 by the World Bank along with the DoE, the report
does not throw up any new ideas nor does it explore any different
approaches. For instance, the lack of packaged software products from
India has been highlighted as one of the key weaknesses. And the cause
of this--the exorbitant cost of marketing--is by no means a revelation.

Indeed, Indian software companies do not have the means today to absorb
such costs, but the question is, when is it likely to happen? It is an
issue which merits more than a cursory reference, since products have a
major role to play in achieving the year 2002 target.

Similarly, the other two major problem areas--lack of adequate venture
capital and absence of original technology--are not new either. However,
with the entry of several foreign venture capital funding firms into
India in the recent past and the steps taken by TDICI, matters relating
to the funding of small software companies have been mitigated to some
extent. Cause for concern remains though, as what steps the Panel would
take to further this has not been touched upon in depth. Coming to the
absence of original technology, one wonders if it merits being mentioned
at all, if no attempt is made in the first place to see why it is so.

As for manpower shortage and dearth of professionals with project
management skills, it is a subject that has been of concern for over
five years now. And we are yet to arrive at a consensus on how this
could be achieved. We are still stuck at the MCA course level and
talking of the need for standardization of these courses. Since this
hasn't happened despite DoE's efforts, it is safe to assume that it is
not likely to happen in the near future also. For the Panel to bank on
it, is an exercise in futility. However, its suggestion that the IITs
double their current output of students by opting for a shift system
with the existing infrastructure has some merit. But again, what are we
looking at? Doubling from an average of 500 professionals from all the
IITs put together? Surely, when we are talking of growing by 10 times,
it would be but a drop in the ocean?

The Panel's recommendation of forming at least 50 software cities across
the country and, better still, closer to engineering colleges is
interesting. Given that the major metros are increasingly getting out of
reach for most start-up entrepreneurs, this concept is bound to go down
well. It would also mean less clogging of the metros like Bangalore.

However, creating these alternate cities with sops for investors is a
must to attract them. Clearly, the Government has to start making
investments in this direction. And meetings with DoE officials is yet to
bring out the Government's clear stand on this study.

For long we have been talking of India's inherent advantages of a low
cost, high-quality, English-speaking workforce. But over the years, even
as we have been boasting, other Asian countries, having realized the
potential in this business, have begun catching up with India. What the
country now requires is a new perspective and the sooner it comes, the
better.

HOTLINE: NEW CISCO TECHNOLOGY CUTS INTERNET ACCESS RATES

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Internet access fees may be cut by half and data will move faster along
the worldwide computer network as a result of a new technology
introduced by Cisco Systems recently. The new technology will add the
equivalent of a postal zipcode' to each email message. By attaching an
electronic destination tag to an email message, Internet routers don't
have to concern themselves with the often lengthy destination code of a
message until it has been delivered to the server handing the account.

The new routing technology is expected to help unclog many of the data
arteries suffering from an overload of users during peak hours, causing
email messages to take considerably longer to get delivered. Cisco says
that the tag technology, combined with other throughput-boosting
innovations will enable existing Internet equipment to process data up
to four times faster. Another major advantage of the tag technology is
that paths of travel through the Internet can be established so reliably
that Internet access providers will be able to offer their customers up
to three levels of service and prices.

Cisco will present the new router technology, to be made as the standard
for traffic routing, to the Internet Engineering Task Force. As such,
the company would give up ownership of the technology and allow other
firms to use it as a common tool or feature in their Internet products.

HOTLINE: PACKARD BELL SETTLES A CASE: USED PARTS CASE

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Without admitting guilt, Packard Bell Electronics Inc. has settled a
case brought up by 22 states in the US, accusing the PC-maker of selling
new computers which contained parts from returned, previously sold
units. According to the terms of the settlement, Packard Bell has agreed
to pay attorney fees and investigative costs to each of the 22 states
involved in the case. Additionally, the company will label all packages
which contain systems involved in the practice and provide retailers
with point-of-sale material to inform potential customers. January 1997
has been set as a date for beginning the labeling process. Any system
containing parts from returned PCs will also have to be warranted as
new.

Significantly, Packard Bell has walked away from the settlement with no
fines, no penalties, and an agreement of no further litigation. The
company also said that a similar suit was dismissed involving PCs
purchased at Military exchanges and through Government agencies. Again,
without admitting wrongdoing, the PC-maker settled--this time for $ 3.5
million.

HOTLINE: ROUGH TIMES FOR ROCK OLIVETTI

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Olivetti is facing rough times: While the Chairman has resigned, the
company's shares have done yo-yo impersonations on the Italian Stock
Exchange (ISE), even forcing a suspension at one point recently. At the
same time, reports of a power struggle in the boardroom have surfaced,
with several senior staff members reported to be leaving.

The rocky path that Olivetti has trodden in the recent times has
suddenly become even rockier. The activities of its executives are under
investigation. The investigation centers around the possibility that the
company's losses for the first six months of the year have been
understated. Olivetti's board announced worse-than-expected pre-tax
losses of 440.2 billion lire ($ 290 million) and a net debt of 1,260
billion lire ($ 860 million) for the six months ended 30 June 1996. Much
of the blame for the losses has been laid at the door of the PC
division, plus the cost of on-going restructuring. Olivetti has been
spraying its profit and loss account with red ink for four years now.

Despite claims that the PC division had turned the corner, the division
is still costing the firm large chunks of operating revenue, and
investors are less than pleased with the division's performance.

To prevent any share sell-offs, the ISE has suspended the company's
shares. Although the investigation announcement and share trading
suspension would have upset investors, industry experts have welcomed
the management changes. They are talking about the possibility that the
company may pull out of PC production altogether.

HOTLINE: DECKS CLEARED FOR TISL NAME CHANGE

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

The reported name-change of TISL to Tata-IBM Ltd is expected to take
place in the next quarter with the Tata empire changing the royalty
structure levied on its stable of companies. The revised royalty
structure dividing the companies into A', B', and C' categories have two
IT companies--Tata Elxsi and Tata Unisys--in the A' group and because of
this these companies will have to pay the highest royalty--0.25 percent
of their net turnover or 5 percent of their net profit, whichever is
lower. These royalty structures are effective starting 1996-97 fiscal.

Says Ravi Dubey, VP Corporate Communications, Tata,"The change of name
of TISL is driven by the market needs of the company itself. It is in no
way linked to royalties. As a matter of fact royalty is not considered
at all when a company name is to be changed." As for an official
statement he said that they did not have any to make as yet.

However, in case of joint venture companies where the foreign partner
does not charge a royalty fee and offers the brand name on a gratis
basis, Tata will waive the royalty fee. Applicable to TISL and Tata's JV
with AT&T, the rumors pertaining to the name-change of TISL to Tata-IBM
Ltd, long doing the rounds, may finally be cleared. The name changing
exercise has taken so long because negotiations between IBM and TISL
were getting stuck whenever the issue of royalties came up. With the
royalty terms now cut and dried it will be easier for both parties to
conclude their deal smoothly.

WINDOWS 95--THE YEAR AFTER

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

A look at how this wonder-kid' has fared, and what the future holds for
it.

Windows 95 will change the way people use computers. The ease of use
usually associated with Mac is finally going to be available on the PC.

There is a widespread belief that the success of Windows 95 will spur a
massive surge in the sale of PCs and hence spark off a serious demand
for hardware. Orders for semiconductors--a leading indicator of PC
sales--has risen 54 percent. The expectations across the board from the
stock market to average PC user are extremely high. Microsoft has
planned its greatest ever media blitzkrieg to entice 85 million
customers and a $ 130 billion industry to upgrade to Windows 95. An ad
campaign costing several tens of millions of dollars and featuring rock
legends such as Mick Jagger and his 1981 classic, "Start me up" has been
planned. That was August 95.

Windows 95 is the first operating system Microsoft has offered both on
CD-ROM and floppies, giving the company lots of extra space for
gimmicks. A CD-ROM holds 660 MB of data, compared to 1.4 MB for a floppy
disk; Two full length music videos and a film trailer are available on
all CD-ROM versions. Three video clips alone hog up to 220 MB of data.

The company says that more testing has gone into this software than any
software ever written. 400,000 beta copies, 15 million lines of computer
code. A year and several bugs later, what has been the impact of this
hype and the hoopla? What does one really get from Windows 95? What are
the lessons learnt and the long term implications on the computer
industry in general? To upgrade or not to upgrade? What does the future
hold for the competition. This article explores these fundamental
issues.

What do you get from Windows 95?

32-bit OS: From a user perspective, 32 bit programs are a little faster
than conventional 16-bit programs. But the real benefit is for
programers. Gone are the days of large and tiny memory models, gone are
the days of Intel's segmented memory addressing.

PLUG-N-PLAY: You get a plug-and-play OS, which promises relatively
simple management of hardware configuration on your PC. Anybody who has
juggled IRQ numbers and memory addresses to install a PC card will
appreciate the plug-and-play features of Windows 95. Mac users have
taken plug-and-play for granted for years. It is finally time for the
PC. What does plug-and-play mean? This means that Windows 95 has the
ability to automatically recognize a new piece of hardware as it is
added to your PC. Plug-and-play works only if the peripheral bus on your
motherboard and the new piece of hardware you are adding are
plug-and-play compatible. It detects such things as modems and printers
automatically and configures them. Plug-and-play is the new standard
developed by a whole slew of hardware vendors led by Intel and
Microsoft. Unfortunately, plug-and-play does not work on the millions of
new PCs and adapter cards available in the market. However, Windows 95
still does a reasonably good job of identifying most of the popular
legacy adapter cards automatically during installation.

EASE OF NETWORKING: This is one of the really positive features of
Windows 95. You get support for TCP/IP, IPX/SPX straight out of the box.

To make things even more simple, Windows 95 even throws in a NetWare
client for free. Since it is a Win32 compatible platform, all of the
popular Web browsers--Netscape, NCSA Mosaic, Spry's Air Mosaic work just
fine in Windows 95. Other networking goodies include--Dial-up networking
support, including PPP, SLIP, and RAS for Windows NT.

UNIVERSAL MESSAGING LAYER: This is the very first implementation of
Microsoft's long awaited Messaging API, also known as MAPI. This allows
various messaging service providers to "plug-in" their services, and
thus achieve seamless integration with the built in messaging client in
Windows 95. MAPI is a powerful API, going beyond simple messaging. It is
more like an API for information exchange, and it really opens the door
for useful applications like document storage and retrieval, and Lotus
notes type of bulletin board-like applications. The downside to this is
that although MAPI is an open standard and thus would work with any
messaging service, the only built in messaging services in Windows 95
are for Microsoft Network, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft Mail,
and Internet POP mail. If you want email connectivity to other messaging
services, you would have to get your own MAPI providers.

USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE: Microsoft has spent countless hours on
usability testing to improve the interface for Windows 95. Consistency
and convenience are a few of the key features of Windows 95. The right
mouse button has had its day at last. If you click the right mouse
button, almost always a pop-up menu comes up, listing the most commonly
used operations that can be done on that object at that time. Among
those menu-items there is almost always a menu-item called
"Properties..." If you choose "Properties..." you usually get a
"Property Sheet" (Everyone else in the world calls them "Tabbed
Dialogs"!) dialog listing all the settings. For instance if you click
the right mouse button on the desktop and choose the "Properties..."
menu-item, a dialog box comes up, which lets you change colors, display
resolution settings, screen savers etc. etc.

DRASTICALLY IMPROVED SHELL: If you have never considered yourself a fan
of Windows 3.1 Program Manager, you might end up liking the Windows 95
shell. The desktop finally gets a life of its own. You can at last
create program icons (called "Shortcuts" in Windows 95) right on the
desktop. If you've always got lost in Windows 95 as soon as you create
more than 3 or 4 windows, you would appreciate the new "Task Bar" at the
bottom. Whenever you minimize a window in Windows 95, the icon moves to
the bottom, on something which looks like standard status bar. As you
minimize more and more windows, all of those icons move to the same bar.

This "Task Bar" is always visible and hence, if you quickly want to go
to some other application it is just one-mouse click away.

What I don't get from Windows 95?

BLAZING SPEED: In fact, all 16-Bit Windows 3.1 applications would run a
little bit slower. The actual speed would depend on many factors like
the amount of memory etc., but no matter how much memory your system has
the speed is a little bit slower.

ROBUST OS: Windows 95 is a lot more robust than Windows 3.1. Windows 95
is more stable than previous versions of Windows and crashes less often.

It is now more difficult for mis-behaving applications to crash the
operating system, though it is still possible to do it. Microsoft paid a
heavy price for speed and compatibility. Under the hood of Windows 95,
there is still a lot of old DOS and 16-bit Windows code! Hence, there
are a lot of back-door entries into the operating system code. The other
main drawback--all 16 bit applications share the same message queue, and
it is the systems message queue. So if you have a 16 bit application
which has gone into an infinite loop, you have a hung system!

To upgrade or not to upgrade?

It often makes sense to upgrade with drastic improvements in software
capability. However, one begins to think twice when upgrade costs top 25
to 30 percent of the cost of a new machine. In general, with anything
older than a 486 based machine, it is advisable to upgrade--Windows 95
or otherwise. Windows 95 will typically stake out at least 40 MB of hard
drive with Windows 95 ready application programs hogging up several more
megabytes of space. So it is probably a good idea to have a larger hard
disk (at least 300 MB or more). In addition, running multiple programs
simultaneously implies one will be inclined to go in for a larger
monitor (15 inch or bigger) of some sort.

Will Windows 95 boost PC sales?

It was anticipated that is would. It turned out that the expectations
were far over-estimated. Several PC manufacturers cancelled orders for
hardware, thereby drastically affecting semiconductor manufacturers.

Several leading semiconductor companies had to resort to lay-offs to
counter the unprecedented drop in sales. The next couple of fiscal
quarters are critical to the success of several of these companies. All
the anticipated surge in sale of new PCs never really occurred. On the
other hand, several existing PC users have upgraded to Windows 95, as
have several corporations with PC networks, though gradually. The result
being, semiconductors stocks taking a beating while Microsoft's stock
has continued to surge ahead on Wall street.

What is the future for Windows 95?

The biggest threat to Microsoft seems to be the rapid growth of the
Internet and software drive by this growth. Netscape, which has been at
the forefront of the Internet revolution, appears to be the leading
player in this area. With the growth of intranets (computer networks
within corporations) and the WWW, the Netscape browser is fast becoming
the interface of choice in corporations. Meanwhile, leading companies
such as Oracle, IBM, and Sun Microsystems are anxious to break the
Wintel monopoly (Intel-Microsoft PC monopoly) and are defining the
Network computer along with "Java applets" (applications that reside on
a network rather than on a local hard disk) as next wave in computing
technology. The result of this intense battle remains to be seen and we
hope to discuss this more in detail in a future article.

ANOTHER OS WAR?

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

It has all the makings of the EDP managers ultimate nightmare. 1996-97
will see the release of new versions of almost all desktop operating
systems. But what could have been a no-holds-barred OS war looks like
ending without even a whimper!

Uncharacteristically, Microsoft is first off the block this time with NT
4. IBM will pitch in with Merlin, Netware Green river is in advanced
Beta, Apple promises to have long delayed Copland out by mid-97, and
rounding off the year will again be Microsoft with Windows 97. Add to
it, new stuff like Spring and Inferno and you have quite a potent brew.

Before the marketing whiz kids take over, here is a quick look at the
promises each OS has to keep.

Green River--Netware To IntranetWare?

At Novell, the spotlight has shifted from Green river to the search for
a new CEO. In a sudden move, Novell and CEO Frankenberg parted ways,
with Novell searching for new corporate directions.

Meanwhile, Green river is not exactly a major upgrade if one goes by the
version number--4.11. The major deliverables of Green river are SMP
scalability or an ability to handle multiple CPU's, better printing and
network management capabilities, and automatic detection for network
cards.

With better security and full TCP/IP support, Green river is being
squarely positioned as an Internet-compliant intranet platform. Novell
has also announced IntranetWare, which over and above Netware 4.11,
includes Netscape Navigator, FTP Services for NetWare, an IPX/IP
Gateway, and a multiprotocol router for WAN and Internet connections.

Copland--A Complete Rewrite

Copland is the first complete rewrite of the Mac OS. Apple is giving up
its long standing commitment of complete backward compatibility for its
operating system and is writing Mac OS 8 only for the PowerPC platform.

(Apple promises to continue support and upgrades for OS 7.5)
Copland has been due for a long time. It was first expected in 1995.

Current target is mid-97.

Copland promises a better interface with customization options,
preemptive multitasking, international language support, and better
communications. Native PowerPC code is expected to make the OS many
times faster. OS 8 will also be the first one from Apple's stables which
can run on boxes other than the Mac. It will run on any machine meeting
the PowerPC specifications.

Merlin--But Where Are The Knights Of The Round Table?

There have been no two opinions about the technical finesse of OS/2.

Merlin is the upgrade of OS/2 Warp. Now scheduled for a 25 September
release, it will be the first OS for the Intel chip with built-in voice
capabilities. Departing from the made-at-IBM-only policy, IBM will
actually replace its own internet explorer with an OS/2 version of
Netscape Navigator. Also, making its debut will be Warp center--based on
Lotus smart center--an object-oriented icon ribbon on the desktop that
will allow users to group and quickly launch programs and check on
system status.

While IBM continues to blow hot and cold about OS/2, the question is not
whether Merlin will deliver on its promises but whether it can
capitalize on the deliverables. Will the magician take OS/2 onto the
winning league? or will this damsel in distress have to continue to wait
for a Knight in shining armour to come to her rescue?

Windows 97--A New Way To Organize Your Files

After Win 95, it's going to be Win 97 with no 96 in between. Official
information is still scarce on what it will be like in 97.

A major change is to be in the way files are organized and accessed.

Windows 97 will have an Internet browser type explorer with a Web page
like organization of directories and files, in place of the current
hierarchical one. Is this Microsoft's version of the Internet PC, with
local disks mimicking the Internet, and both being accessed by
applications in the same way.

Oh! and by the way, what will it be this time in place of Start me up'?

NT and Win 95--Will The Twain Ever Meet?

Microsoft has not been clear about the future of NT and Win 95. Current
trends seem to indicate that NT is going the Win 95 way in look and
feel, while Win 95 seems to be going the NT way (in 97) as far as OS
organization and drivers go. Will the two merge into one or will they go
separate ways?

Inferno--A Long Way To Go

When it was first announced, Inferno was seen by many as a potential
challenger to Java. But while Java (and Java hype) continues to rule the
Net, Inferno is nowhere near to being the challenger it was supposed to
be.

Inferno is actually a combination of the Inferno operating system, the
Limbo programming language, the Dis virtual machine for Limbo, and the
Styx communication protocol. Behind all these strange names, Inferno is
supposed to provide transparent distributed computing in a local area,
wide area or global client server environment.

Resources on Inferno are represented as files and most functions are
implemented as basic file commands. Irrespective of the physical
location of a resource, it will show up on the same hierarchical file
system and will be accessed by Styx. Object code written in Limbo will
execute in the Dis environment with as little as 1 MB memory.

That makes Inferno sound like the operating system for the Internet PC.

So, is Inferno's time yet to come?

NEXTSTEP--OS To API?

NeXTSTEP was Steve Jobs' attempt at recreating the Mac magic after his
ouster from Cupertino. Somewhere along the way, he gave up in part and
sold off the hardware--NeXT Cube and NeXT Station--but continued the
development of NeXTSTEP as an object-oriented OS. Now with the
announcement of OPENSTEP, an API--for among other things Windows NT--as
the upgrade to NeXTSTEP, Jobs seems to have given up the effort
completely.

NeXT Software continues, 300 people strong, focussing on Internet
technologies and products.

Conclusion

The general directions seem to be the same in every case. Good old DOS
is dead. The Internet is in and so are intranets--at the OS level.

Graphics, distributed computing, and networking seem to be the
loadstones for the future.

Apple has more or less squandered its huge lead in things graphical and
is grappling with enormous problems on all fronts. Whatever advantage
Copland would have bought, ***it has been greatly eroded by Win 95. OS2,
acclaimed for its technical finesse, is caught midway between IBM's
prevarication and a lack of application base. Netware is the only one in
the pack which is not a true operating system. It is also the only one
which is not fully graphical.

Does that mean that we are in for a more-dominated-by-Windows world? Any
wagers that one of the others will still rise, a phoenix from the ashes
of the past, to mount a successful challenge to the Microsoft
juggernaut?

NETWORK INTERFACE DEVICES: AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROMISES AND THREATS

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

By all means, there is definitely a lot that is going for the
network-computer type of devices. An analysis of the promises threats

IBM, Sun, Oracle, Wyse, NCD, Acer, Sony, Acorn, Nintendo, Toshiba,
Digital, ViewCall Europe plc., and other vendors have announced plans to
develop and build low-cost devices targeted to replace
Intel/Windows-based PCs. These devices go by many names--`Network
Terminals', `Network Computers (NC)', `Internet Terminals' and so forth.

Whatever the name, a great deal of interest has been generated
throughout Asia-Pacific in these emerging alternative computer
platforms.

The level of interest differs from one country to another, varying
according to the installed corporate PC base, the strength of corporate
networks and local Internet services, and the dominant culture, which
influences the level of employee autonomy. In Japan, China, and Korea,
highly centralized organizations micro-manage employees and have
consequently resisted movements to have a `mainframe on every desktop'
and to have `distributed, empowered workers' that have swept over the
world in the last 10 years. Many enterprises in these countries are
following the debate over `Internet Terminals' with enthusiasm. They see
an opportunity to reap the rewards of distributed computing without
incurring the pain of high total costs of ownership that come with it.

These countries are investing in nation-wide high-speed networks using
the latest technologies. If they invest more in the network, do they
also need to invest more to maintain and manage the PCs?

These so-called `Internet terminals' have been widely ridiculed by many
in the Western media, but for the wrong reasons. While everyone agrees
that these devices cannot, and will not, replace already purchased PCs,
we believe there will be value in these devices.

Generically, we define a class of devices that is totally
network-dependent as `Network Interface Devices' (NIDs). Thus, while
traditional fixed-function terminals and X-terminals are indeed NIDs, a
low-end PC that can independently run some personal productivity
applications along with Internet access is not, according to our
definition, a NID. Today, the two new classes of NIDs that will be
entering the market are browser-based NIDs and Windows-based NIDs. The
ability to distinguish between these two classes of NIDs is critically
important for enterprises to properly leverage these technologies.

The browser-based NID is a device dedicated to Internet access (both
through the intranet and Internet), mainly World Wide Web server access,
through browser-like functionality. These devices range from products
such as the ViewCall set-top box--where `Surfing the Web' is performed
through the remote control and a TV screen--to those envisioned by Sun
and Oracle--where, equipped with extensions like Java, the products
deliver application functionality that can be executed on the device.

Ventures like Sun's and Oracle's exploit the capabilities of large
server configurations, leveraging the core capabilities of these
vendors. As innovative as these solutions are, however, they are
primarily incremental markets to those of traditional PCs and will have
little long-term effect on user's choice of enterprise desktop. The
ability to run applications locally will be enabled through the addition
of Java-like capabilities. Yet few productive Java applications exist
today, which restricts the initial application of browser-based NIDs to
those enterprises that want to provide low-cost, low-complexity Internet
access, such as hotel suites, kiosks, libraries, and educational
facilities.

The Windows-based NID is a device that has more of a role to play within
the enterprise today than the browser-based NID. Vendors of these
devices (e.g. NCD's Explora and Wyse's WinTerm) have also characterized
their devices as `Internet desktops'. While this has given the vendors a
chance to receive more media attention than their products perhaps would
have gotten otherwise, this characterization overlooks the main appeal
of these NIDs. The remote Windows technology used in these devices is
based on presenting a Windows desktop on a NID that is not running
Windows. These low-priced desktop NIDs (less than $ 1,000) allow full
access to complete Windows NT desktop and to all the Windows
applications from a central server, without the complexity of building
and supporting the Windows environment in each desktop. While these
solutions are not appropriate for those involved with nomadic or mobile
computing (since there is no `offline' mode for NIDs), there are
configurations where Windows-based NIDs are a lower-cost solution. These
NIDs only provide the user interface, enabling any Windows application
(browsers, groupware clients, or 3270 emulators) to run on the server
and facilitate full exploitation of distributed and client server
solutions. While NIDs will not replace every desktop PC, we believe that
NIDs will comprise 10 percent of new corporate desktop purchases in 1998
(0.7 probability).

While both the NIDs can evolve to support complete computing
environments, their initial approaches are different. The major
difference between the Windows-based NID and the browser-based NID is
that browser-based NIDs rely on the Web connectivity paradigm, in which
the browser is the presentation platform through which a user accesses
its computing environment. The Web approach is very network-centric,
independent of the hardware platform, and desktop operating system (OS).

For the execution of applications, browser-based NIDs are totally
reliant on programming languages, environments, and collaborative suites
(such as Java) that are in the early stages of development, but are
network-enabled. No mainstream versions of these types of NIDs are
currently available. Windows-based NIDs use a standard Windows interface
as their primary presentation platforms and an NT Server as the `host'.

For applications, the main feature of the Windows-based NID is the
remote presentation of NT server-based Windows applications allowing
access to the "legacy Windows environment". However, the Windows-based
NID technology does not address any `network-enablement' that Microsoft
may introduce into the application environment. Note, a Windows-based
NID can access any browser running on the NT Server, providing Web
access and, therefore, duplicating the functionality of a browser-based
NID.

These devices are not just for accessing the Internet. Initially
envisioning a low-cost network-connected device, the market referred to
NIDs as Internet terminals. This name is completely misleading. A more
appropriate term could be a "Web terminal" or "Web computer," but even
these names are too restrictive. These devices are not only designed to
access the Internet via the Web, but to run applications as well. Short
term, the Windows-enabled NIDs (e.g. from NCD and Wyse) will be able to
run applications using technology licensed from Citrix. With the Citrix
remote Windows presentation protocol, NIDs will be able to remotely
present a Windows desktop and any Windows-based application. Longer
term, as applications based on Java appear, both the Windows-based and
browser-based NIDs could run applications based on Java. The attraction
to organizations will be in a lower total cost of ownership. In many
Gartner Group research papers, we have indicated that the most
significant portion of the total cost of ownership of PCs is in the
ongoing support and maintenance of the PC platform. The fundamental
problem of how to implement software distribution to hundreds or
thousands of desktops is one of the most significant issues faced by
large organizations. Supporting the underlying complexity of today's
networked computing environment is another significant issue. Support
for the underlying complexity of these environments includes service and
support when moving parts break (most NIDs do not have hard drives,
floppy drives or fans), and support when users inadvertently corrupt
their desktop operating environment. All of these issues are resolved by
using NIDs. The browser and remote presentation code can be
electronically updated over the network into `flash ROM'--a technology
that is available today, but has rarely been used over the network. The
primary attraction of NIDs is to reduce the complexity and, therefore,
the cost of network computing.

Another user misconception is that enterprises will be running NIDs
directly on the Internet or somehow using the Internet to deploy
mission-critical corporate applications. This is a complete
misunderstanding of the technology and is propagated by market
references to all of these devices as Internet terminals. The typical
configuration will not be as an access device to the Internet. Instead,
like other Internet technologies (such as Web servers and Web browsers),
these technologies will be deployed internally within the secure
corporate network to serve as `information portals' to the corporate
network infrastructure--with data access enabled through Web pages and
application access enabled through Citrix-like technologies and, longer
term, by using `Java-like' technologies.

For Windows-based NIDs the applications are available now. For
browser-based NIDs, the applications will be coming soon. Sun
Microsystems has received a lot of attention for its Java programming
language. Any Java-enabled browser (including Netscape) can execute a
Java application. However, there are no significant mission-critical
Java applications available today. Even with the promise of future
Java-based applications, users could be unwilling to give up their
favorite Windows-based word processing application for one written in
Java that may not provide the same functionality and is probably slower.

Users who are concerned that Java is too slow for many applications
should take into account the continual improvements in the language as
the environment matures, improvements in hardware capabilities, and the
whole concept engendered by the Java paradigm--which we call Networked
Dynamic Functionality (NDF). NDF means that network-centric application
evolved to run its `applets' at the place where they perform best and
application functionality is available when required.

NIDs are not X-terminals. X-terminals provided a GUI to UNIX-based
applications that were stored and executed at the UNIX server. Several
significant differences exist between X-terminals and NIDs. First,
X-terminals solve a specific problem--providing GUI access to UNIX
server-based applications. Performance was tolerable on a local network
segment, but scaled poorly on WAN links. Second, X-terminals are
expensive--typically averaging $ 3,000. Last, the personal productivity
applications that users wanted to access were rarely UNIX-based.

UNIX-based emulation of Windows applications (e.g. WABI) was limited to
a subset of applications and suffered from poor performance. NIDs are
based on technologies that were designed around the need to access the
most ubiquitous environments (the Web and Windows) and evolved with an
emphasis on performance across a WAN. For NIDs, price structures are
hitting new low points, through set-top and game-player configurations
and following the pricing trend of PCs.

NIDs are not traditional diskless workstations. Traditional diskless
workstations (TDWs) still run a `full-blown' local OS and `local
applications' that are stored elsewhere. Therefore, a TDW carries along
all of the internal complexity of a full-blown PC, minus local storage.

With a NID, the only OS services available will be those used to serve
the user interface (therefore, a reduction in internal complexity is
possible within the device). Execution of applications will not occur on
a NID, but will be distributed to an appropriate server system. While
the NID model is more biased toward distributed computing, TDWs were
biased toward networked storage.

WHY'S ABOUT YEAR 2000

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

In light of the costs and risks, companies should look at automated and
creative solutions for the Year 2000 problem.

As the year 2000 approaches, the business community is on the verge of
one of the most significant problems it has experienced. Computer
applications that use the date for commutations, comparisons, and
sorting will produce incorrect results or fail due to invalid data. The
problem stems from programming techniques used during the 1960's and
1970's, when two-digit representations of years were used in most
mainframe applications. Since dates are often used in mathematical
computations and comparisons, errors can easily occur when the two-digit
year is 00'.

The Options

Companies would first have to take an inventory of all their code and
decide upon a strategy. The strategy would involve a combination of
discarding code, replacing some of the code with standard Year-2000
enabled packages, and Year-2000 enabling of the remaining code. The
proportion of code falling under each of these categories would depend
on the complexity of the systems in a company. Companies that have a
sizable portion of their critical systems developed and maintained
in-house would address this problem by looking at reengineering and
platform migration options.

A challenge most companies will face is having to justify spending
millions of dollars on a problem that seems so trivial. At the end of
the exercise, there may be no perceived business gains, except that the
organization would continue operations as usual. The tendency will be to
propose to reengineer some or most of the systems--the perceived
benefits would justify the expense. Before choosing the reengineering
option, however, factors such as cost, time available, resource
requirements, risk, and the company's record of success with
reengineering efforts should be considering. The cost of process and
business reengineering includes training, personnel reallocation, and
change management--making it an extremely expensive affair. Most
companies may end up choosing a mixture of the two options. This choice
may not be available as the time available decreases.

Date Enabling The Code And Data

In all probability, organizations will choose to enable some portion of
their code base as there is just not enough time to handle the issue any
other way. Year-2000 enabling could be done in one of three ways--date
expansion, date interpretation, or date manipulation.

* Date expansion involves increasing the year data to store four digits
and modifying all applications that store and access this data. While
the software development effort involved in this strategy is relatively
low, the impact on operations and the coordination required is very
high. This is an ideal strategy for a software product manufacturer,
since such a company would not have the problems of large data and
productionization.

* A date interpretation strategy does not involve changing the data, but
only involves changing the source code to read the data differently. For
instance, in a 70/30' strategy, any year data that is above 70 implies
that the data represents the twentieth century and any year data less
than 70 implies that the data represents the twenty-first century.

Although no major coordination effort is required, every program that
refers to a date field should be changed and significant testing is
required.

This is best employed where the data cannot be changed as it is live
data being used by several applications. This is the ideal strategy for
in-house and production systems.

* A date manipulation strategy involves adding a specific number of
years to the year field. This strategy is ideal for in-house or
production systems where the input and output processing is well
controlled through a limited number of programs. The ideal solution in
most cases may be to implement a mixture of these strategies to areas
most applicable rather than forcing one strategy.

The Methodology

The methodology that would be followed is fairly well defined. An
inventory collection phase is followed by a study of the impact of the
Year-2000 issue on the code. Several commercially available tools help
automate this effort for some of the more popular programming languages
such as COBOL and PL/1. Normally, impact analysis tools are complemented
by code conversion tools which automate the process of enabling the
code. Such tools process several million lines of code per month and are
available for some popular programming languages like COBOL. For
proprietary languages both the analysis and conversion effort will have
to be done manually--a process that takes a lot longer, costs more, and
introduces more bugs.

By the end of code and data enabling, only half the work is done. The
rest--unit and system testing--is not automatable. Unit testing may be
minimal if no manual changes are made and the tool is very reliable and
covers all possible cases. In most cases, unit testing is not trivial.

The most difficult part of the methodology is system testing, since
application knowledge is required. In most cases, this is difficult to
find, especially for the areas of the system that have been stable and
functioning well for several years.

Regardless of the strategy chosen for Year 2000 enabling, the effort
required does not vary much. In case the choice made is to work with a
service provider, the total effort required for data manipulation may be
the lowest. However, it involves the maximum on-site effort, thereby
making it expensive. The data interpretation option would be least
expensive in terms of resources.

Factors Influencing Actual Year 2000 Cost Per Line Of Code

Simplistic code enabling sizing exercises focus on the number of Lines
of Code (LoC) and attach a rate to each LOC. The rate quoted varies from
$ 0.50 to $ 1.50. However, Gartner projections and DBSS experience shows
that the quoted include only the cost of labor and tools of the service
provider for a line of structured COBOL code. The actual expense
incurred by a company for a Year 2000 project could work out to several
times the rate per LoC often quoted by the service providers. Some of
the factors to be considered are:

* Availability of tools for the target environment.

* Availability of application expertise.

* Programming language complexity (in case the language is not COBOL).

* Missing source code.

* Multiple versions of source code
* Testing requirements and complexity.

* CPU and DASD resources for parallel and integration tests.

* Permanent increase in DASD requirement.

* Availability and opportunity cost of using internal resources.

* Implementation and productionization.

* User training.

* Post-implementation supports costs.

In one production environment, the cost per LoC for the software
development effort of the client and DBSS together worked out to
$0.87/line of COBOL code. Of this, the DBSS cost for the on site and
India effort together was $0.45/line of COBOL code. The total cost
worked out to $2.81/LoC. This includes the cost of deciding upon the
strategy, post-implementation support, reengineering lost code, and
increased volumes. Based on the initial assumption of $1.00/LOC the
company had budgeted $18 million for the project. However, the total
cost of the project was $50 million.

For another client, a product vendor, the total cost did work out to
less than $1.50/LOC. This included the cost of internal resources as
well as the cost of testing. Of course, they did have better code, no
lost code, and existing test plans.

Next Step

For a company that is yet to start or just becoming aware of the
problem, a few steps need to be taken immediately. The organization
should try to understand the real size and cost of the problem and
analyze the impact to their business. Waiting for the magic bullet'
would only result in the business having to shut down. Finally, a
company would do well to invite solution providers to at least help them
in a preliminary impact analysis exercise while continuing to educate
itself of the nature and size of this self-designed virus'.

The Right Mix: Breaking into the US market

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

What are the options available to Indian companies wanting to make their
mark in the US market? Which is the most viable? A look at the pros and
cons involved.

In my last article (Where are the right people, September 30),I had
addressed the manpower issue to emphasize why we need to improve revenue
productivity. In this article, I will address the viability of the
product option.

There is a perception among many software companies that the only way to
improve revenue productivity is by taking up packaged products. However,
many senior people in the industry are taking a pragmatic view in
pointing out the risks associated with doing that.

Very few non US companies have been successful in the product market
worldwide. The general expectation of customer support and services in
the US market (which is also the biggest segment) is one of the highest
in the world. Meeting this expectation requires huge investments and a
deep pocket. Given the difficulties in getting finance and the cost of
capital, products may not be a very profitable option! The Indian
company could focus entirely on engineering and let the US partner
handle the entire marketing. In this case, sharing of revenues and
profits may not be favorable to the Indian company, because the
development cost is often about 10 to 20 percent of the total cost.

The virtual monopoly of US companies in the product market is a fact to
reckon with. An analysis of the world's top 100 IT companies and the top
50 companies by software and services revenues (Source: Datamation)
provides some interesting results:

Top 100 IT companies: Of the 33 based outside the US, 30 deal with
hardware, two with services (Cap Gemini Sogeti, Italy, and Intec, Japan)
and one with software (SAP, Germany).

Top 50 companies (by software product revenues): Only two (SAP and
Software AG, Germany) are based outside the US.

Top 50 companies (by services revenues): eight are based outside the
US--Cap Gemini Sogeti and Finsiel (Italy), Intec and Nomura (Japan),
Sema Group and Sligos (France), SAP and British Telecom.

Non-US companies seem to be more successful in services than products.

To understand why, let us look at the challenges of marketing products
in the US and what kind of resources it takes. While the US is the
biggest market for software products, it is also the most competitive.

Taking the product route therefore requires a lot of resources, which
could become a bottleneck for many Indian companies. First, you need
market information to decide what is state-of-the-art and what features
will sell. Your US-based competitors have an edge over you, simply
because they have a better feel of the market and a local presence. How
much could you spend on market research or how far could you depend on
your US partner for market information? Second, the cost of marketing in
the US is phenomenal and even the top Indian software companies often
find it better to tie up with a US distributor rather than handle
marketing entirely on their own. A distributor in the US (like anywhere
else) looks at any product from two perspectives--margins and volumes.

Can every Indian company offer products which are high value or which
are fast selling? To protect their own margins and improve volumes, they
have to offer something very innovative and something not yet available
in the US market. With limited information and the pressure on time,
success depends on the kind of resources that can be pumped into product
development.

The general expectation of product marketing and support in the US is
very high. Most product vendors in the US have toll free (1-800) numbers
where one can contact (free of charge) to obtain product and marketing
information. Distributors in the US are responsible only for providing
local contact, carrying inventory, and providing first-level support or
training (often at extra cost). Installation is always do-it-yourself,
using manuals. If a user has a difficulty with manuals or needs
technical support, he is expected to contact the vendor directly using a
toll free number. Even if a US distributor provides the infrastructure,
the Indian company has to provide people to handle installation and
technical support. Support costs in the US can therefore be considerable.

Obtaining finances and bearing the interest cost could be a problem for
many Indian companies taking the product route. In turnkey projects,
most companies get paid periodically on completion of a milestone and
cash flows are more predictable. But the in-flows of product revenues
are highly skewed against out-flows of investments and expenses. First,
where is the mechanism to fund product investments? What kind of
pressure will investors, financial institutions, and the top management
put in order to maintain or improve the bottomline? If Indian companies
start cutting corners to save costs, will it not work to their
disadvantage? These are important questions to be answered.

Some Indian companies feel that they could get into a two-way marketing
and support tie-up with a US software vendor. The US vendor could handle
Indian products in the US with a similar arrangement in the Indian
market for his products. This helps the Indian company avoid investing
in infrastructure (like 1-800 lines) and people in the US. But this
option has to be carefully evaluated from both sides. First, most US
vendors are more interested in selling their products in India (or the
Asian market) than selling Indian products in the US. Second, Indian
products in general and the brand "Made in India" are not popular in the
US. Will the US vendor's commitment to the Indian product be strong
enough? What happens, if at a late stage, the US partner backs out? Will
the Indian company be left high and dry?

Products carry a higher risk because marketing is often not entirely
under your control and your investments and returns are often spread
over a longer period of time. Does this mean products fetch higher
profits? Not necessarily. Development costs are often far lower than
marketing and distribution costs (which form a bigger share of the total
cost). If your investments and risks are only in development and your
partner picks up all the costs (and associated risks) of marketing, the
profit sharing is bound to be in his favour. If you take on more
responsibility by sharing the marketing and support costs you can claim
a bigger share of profits. But then, your investments and expenses will
be higher. Either way, there is a trade-off.

Of course, Indian companies have to improve their revenue productivity
and reduce the dependency on people. But given the resource
requirements, the product route may not be the best solution for every
Indian company. Two models can achieve this objective, without demanding
a lot of resources. One is creating intellectual property usable across
multiple projects or products. This allows companies to leverage the
investment and get higher revenues over a period of time. The other is
to ask customers to pay for the value of the solution regardless of the
effort or input. My next two articles will examine these models
(Intellectual Property and Pay for Solutions) in detail.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: A TIME FOR VISION

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

Strategizing for the future may seem a little irrelevant, and perhaps a
little trivial, in the Indian context. For an industry that is a modest
Rs 9,712 crore, which is just a little were than the size of India's
largest corporate entity--Telco--but an industry which made the axiom
`change is the only constant' true more than ever before, it appears
that planning for the future is the only way to survive. This applies to
Indian companies participating in this nascent industry, irrespective of
size or content. We examine where we are in terms of future planning,
how we got here, and what are the issues that we need to tackle to
realize the true potential of India Inc.

It has been argued at length that the Indian IT industry (read hardware)
is a mere subset of the US (read global) IT industry--there isn't a
single player of global significance that does not have a presence in
India, either as joint ventures or as fully-owned subsidiaries. It is
also said that these companies do not have any strategies far removed
from their parent companies and that they merely follow the trend that
is extant overseas. What we have is both a technologically volatile and
technology-dominated industry. Hence, fashioning a strategy in India
that is separate and removed from the West, in this case the US, would
need a combination of creativity and taking cues from what has happened
elsewhere in the world. There are two problems here. For one, it is an
industry which is driven by technological advances--from microprocessors
to system software--in all core competency areas, and which for the most
part resides in the West. Two, given the rapid changes that are taking
place in the Indian market, strategizing is as much keeping pace with
the market changes as it is keeping pace with technology. Historically,
while in India, computer usage has been traditionally low, the
assimilation of computer technology was not too far behind than that in
the US. And increasingly we are bridging that gap. The possibility of
Indian companies increasingly choosing a foreign brand of PC as against
the existing local brands (HCL, Wipro, PCL) became more than real.

Viewed in this context, a Shiv Nadar joining hands with Hewlett Packard,
Ashok Soota tying up with Acer, Ratan Tata signing up with IBM, Dadan
Bhai setting up Altos to manufacture Dell motherboards are instances of
strategic thinking for the future.

The Indian Imperative

The other side of the picture is that a strategy which leads to closure
of local manufacturing is no strategy at all, and least of all a
foresight. This is where strategizing in the Indian context has come to
embody certain focussed moves in the market. But Indian companies had to
juggle between an Indian market that is not only notoriously
price-sensitive and averse to changing old systems for new with the same
alacrity as in the West, but also had to contend with some draconian
duties in the form of import, excise, and countervailing duties etc.

They had to judiciously mix and match their strategies when it came to
product launches as well as pricing for various market segments.

For instance, though Wipro discontinued its brand of PCs, HCL's Busybee
and PCL still exist as a brand. We could split hairs on manufacturing
versus assembly and on how many local brands there are vis-a-vis foreign
brands, but the fact is that these brands have retained their identity
despite the odds. And, even though HCL pushed boxes up until the early
nineties, it gave birth to NIIT more than a decade ago, which, in turn,
spawned off the training industry in India. This is one of the rare but
substantial examples of how a brand-building strategy can come to
maturity in an entirely different product segment.

The other aspect of the Indian strategic initiative is the capacity and
the inclination to leverage and adapt on partner skills. Wipro, which
could hit the Indian shores even before liberalization, had marketing
and distribution agreements with companies like Sun Microsystems and
Tandem in order to leverage on their strengths to provide solutions. The
phrase `embrace and extend' may have been coined by the Internet team at
Microsoft but it was definitely adopted first by Indian IT companies, as
a strategic tool. And it has worked wonders here, in different ways for
different companies. Thus, if HP lent engineering skills, world-class
manufacturing methodology, and credibility to HCL, Wipro got a wider PC
product portfolio through Acer, and high-end mission-critical solutions
through Tandem. The locals also figured out that multinationals would
find it difficult, if not impossible (as Compaq has proved in the PC
market), to enter the Indian market all alone.

Similarly, in software too, India has evolved, though it hasn't had to
contend with competing products. It is moving from providing onsite
services to offshore, and is among the most preferred choices for
companies in the US and Europe. Thanks to our USPs. There is a gradual
emergence of software products like Bancs 2000 and Marshal for global
consumption.

The Value Of Foresight

The last four years have been cataclysmic in many ways. Some companies
made a success of it, whereas others weren't as lucky. If there haven't
been any instances of failures in the software industry, it doesn't mean
that they have all been singularly smart or right with their strategies.

It is just that their fate was not as inextricably tied with the
emerging Indian market as that of the hardware industry. CMC is one such
instance. A model company once, it completely failed to see the impact
of having a DEC and IBM locally. And soon it started losing out on TPM
contracts to the foreign companies who were operating directly. This is
a clear example of how medium-term strategic thinking is important for a
company, and how often Indian corporates fail to appreciate this.

Tata Unisys, Tata Elxsi, DCM DataSystems, and PSI Data Systems are all
instances of companies that were late off the block in asking this
crucial question: What will the market look like four to five years
hence? It was not enough to merely read the technological trend
overseas; it was imperative to read the changes taking place in the
Indian market scenario too. Tata was early in acquiring Elxsi, which was
ahead of its time elsewhere and in India, with its 64-bit systems. Bull
mainframes had no takers in the world market, pushed as they were from
the bottom by powerful workstations. The mainframe market in India
didn't exist, except in the minds of a few at PSI.

In the recent past we have seen DEIL coming out of a trough successfully
and then going downhill again. DEIL failed twice, first with its
decision to manufacture a particular range of VAX systems in India, and
second, when it went in for manufacturing Apple systems. While in the
first case, DEIL mistook the latent demand for VAX systems in India to
mean that its demand will continue, in the latter case, it failed to
anticipate internal issues in the company which, inhibited a low-value
item to be pushed alongside high-end VAX and Alpha systems. In both the
cases, it had to suffer losses.

At the same time, there are some companies which have pulled themselves
out of the mess quite admirably, for e.g. DCM DataSystems, Tata Elxsi,
and PSI Data Systems. For instance, DCM, after going through several
rounds of restructuring (which resulted in several heads rolling) and
reengineering, is well on its way to full recovery. In the last
financial year, the company grew by around 100 percent. This was
achieved through its strategy of focusing on customer as a vertical
segment instead of any geography or domain like finance or
manufacturing. According to Veer Sagar, MD, DCM DataSystems, "By
combining responsiveness as an USP, and lowest delivered cost in the
country as the business mission along with customer focus, we have been
able to increase profits by 300 percent over the previous year." DCM has
also cut down management layers from eleven to five, reducing the
distance between the customer and president to just three layers.

PSI Data Systems metamorphosed from PSI Bull, which had set up a
manufacturing site in India to manufacture mainframes. It missed
everything--from the first stirrings of liberalization to the swiftly
changing Government policies to the market demand for open systems as
against proprietary systems. In 1992-93, the company declared nearly
half its turnover of Rs 18.5 crore as loss. The company reengineered its
business operations around software and is now into software services
and systems integration. Says Ajay Mehta, CEO and MD, PSI Datasystems
"Having met all its four objectives set in 1993 at the time of
reengineering, PSI made a modest profit of Rs 1 crore on a turnover of
Rs 20.7 crore."

The Choice Of Learning

Do these successes mean that Indian companies have learnt their lessons
well and are into long-term strategizing? Compared with the India of the
late eighties, we have taken giant strides and are on par with the
world. Today, we talk of the application of leading-edge technologies
with the same level of ease and expertise as anybody else from the same
background in the US does. But take a few steps backward and view the
scenario from a distance. What we see is an India that is still as far
away from the US as it was a decade or two ago. In fact, further off, as
in the same time that we have taken giant strides, the US has taken
quantum leaps in technology. While in India PC penetration has just
crossed 1 million, a company like Compaq alone makes over three million
PCs a year. J Ramachandran, Professor of Corporate Strategy and Policy
Area at IIM Bangalore, says, "It is difficult to envisage an Indian IT
player in the global hardware industry. We were very late in opening up
the economy and today, it doesn't make sense to make India a
manufacturing site. The economies of scale will not work out." Gopal
Srinivasan, Past President, MAIT, has a different point of view.

According to him, the hardware industry is divided into several
segments, of which India has a better chance of breaking into areas like
notebooks assembly, peripherals' assemblies and sub-assemblies. What is
important is that in the last one year, more thought has gone into
devising a strategic line of thinking for charting the course of Indian
industry than at any time in the history. The Arthur D Little study
commissioned by MAIT has also looked at the Indian strategic issues and
has made some recommendations in this regard.

The Question Of Need

Indian companies have been hamstrung by the notion that product
development is a resource-intensive business and has not been very
aggressive in that area. However, in the process several important
issues have got sidetracked and not been pushed as aggressively as they
ought to have been. For instance, surely, we could have worked on
developing regional language interfaces for operating systems and made a
difference to acceptance of computers across the country, and not just
in English-speaking pockets. These are simple straight-forward answers
to admittedly complex issues. Clearly, Indian companies need to
re-invent industries and re-generate strategies as opposed to merely
reengineering their processes. For, strategizing is not all about
safeguarding the present businesses and industries. It has more to do
with inventing new ones and re-inventing the old ones. Like Dr CK
Prahlad and Gary Hamel say in their bestseller Competing For The Future,
"It's a pre-requisite for getting to the future first and a pre-
condition for staying out in front." Dr MB Athreya, Management Advisor,
comments, "I have been advocating since the liberalization paradigm
shift of 1991 that Indian companies should go for a grand vision of high
growth, with long-term strategic planning. This is particularly true for
Indian IT industry, where hardware is growing at 40 percent p.a. and
software at 60 percent p.a. There is a possible vision of India being
the world's fifth largest economy by year 2000 A.D., fourth by 2005 and
third by 2010. Indian IT companies should plan with that mindset. The
new Compaqs and Microsofts could emerge from India."

The Road Less Travelled

But for that to happen, Indian IT companies need to pause and ask
themselves a few crucial questions. How do they see themselves by year
2000. Who will be the customers? Would they have the wherewithal to meet
those challenges? What core competencies can they exploit? It is simply
not enough for these companies to go with the tide as we see today in
the case of hardware companies. There isn't a single player who isn't
into software exports as well. It's high time we moved into developing
engineering software as against commercial software. Engineering is an
area where India has immense talent and we could leverage on it and move
up the value chain, instead of deploying them to create commercial
software. The Internet and intranets have come to India in less than 18
months of their capturing the popular imagination of people in the US.

It is still evolving. New ideas and products are emerging daily. It is
hailed as the great equalizer between companies and between nations.

This could be India's chance of becoming first among equals. Nothing
best paraphrases the sentiment than the quote in Competing For The
Future, "Getting to the future is not just about out-running your
competitors bent on reaching the same prize. It is about having one's
own view of what the prize is. There can be as many prizes as runners;
imagination is the only limiting factor."

THE CORPORATE REALMS: A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE PARTICULAR NATURE OF
STRATEGIES THAT SOME IT COMPANIES IN INDIA FOLLOW

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

In India, we may not have instances like Hewlett-Packard--which
re-invented itself and recreated an industry--but we have been witness
to companies that have restructured and re-invented themselves.

Companies that have successfully carved out a space for themselves
despite the presence of bigger players and in some cases, like Intel,
developed their market beyond the limiting borders.

There are quite a few companies--like Mindware and UB Networks--that are
trying to do what has never been done before in India, or elsewhere. For
instance, UB is introducing the concept of buy-backs--a popular concept
in the white goods industry--wherein it will replace all old unmanaged
stackable hubs with chassis-based hubs. Similarly, Mindware is
experimenting with a new concept in people management.

The companies that follow have employed various strategies at various
points in time, to anchor themselves better in the market. It might
appear that several segments and companies have been left out or
ignored, but we have taken representative categories and not companies.

INTEL INSIDE:

This insignia stamped outside the CPUs of PCs was Intel Corp.'s first
step to come out from the bowels of the motherboard to the outside world
and virtually swamp the world of computing with Intel-made newer and
faster chips. Hardly surprising that soon Intel Inside became more of
`Intel Everywhere'. In India too. And it is to Intel's credit that it
has succeeded in the Indian market which traditionally has been slow to
accept change on a first-come-first-serve basis.

The world markets may have been all frenzied over Pentium, but even in
1994-95, less than 9 percent of the PCs sold in India had Pentium
processors inside. And the situation a year ago hadn't changed
dramatically--the Indian market lagged behind the developed world by
approximately 12-18 months in terms of usage of the latest
microprocessors. In less than a year, the time lag has been cut to nine
months, and today, the penetration of Pentium's stand at over 60
percent.

The credit in large measure goes to Atul Vijaykar, who came as Country
Manager (India) mid last year. If, on one hand, he pushed Intel Corp. to
reduce prices on its chips, on the other, he convinced the Indian
corporates to adopt the latest chip technology. He pushed for increased
usage of computers not just in corporate segments but in schools as
well. In fact, he set up a Cyber School at the Delhi National Science
Centre and recently organized a multimedia show for children along with
Tangerine. He went one step further and brought virtually an army of
small vendors who were assembling PCs, including the grey market
vendors, under the ambit of Intel. So much so that, today, they use the
Intel Inside logo as a seal of guarantee and quality.

Pushing the market in all possible directions, he has succeeded in
keeping up the promise made a year ago that 75MHz Pentium systems of
standard configuration would be available between Rs 50,000 and Rs
60,000, not of an MNC brand though, by late 1996. Of course, Intel's
task was made simpler with the reduction in duties and falling prices of
memory. Admittedly, Intel really has no competitors in the Indian market
to lose sleep over yet, but Vijaykar, not leaving anything to chance,
has managed to galvanize the market for Intel and Pentium-based systems
like never before. The only semblance of competition that they face is
from Apple's PowerPC systems. And if Apple had harbored hopes of
harnessing a bulk of the market before everybody swung the Intel way,
clearly Vijaykar's coming has hammered the proverbial last nail on the
coffin.

MICROLAND'S MACRO VIEW:

MicroLand certainly didn't discover networking. That was done by Zenith
way before MicroLand even came into the picture. But it sure pioneered
networking as an industry in India. And if we have over 35 systems
integrators today, providing networking solutions in the low and medium
end of the corporate market, it is thanks to MicroLand, which
single-handedly spawned off the industry.

But that is not the only reason why MicroLand gets mentioned here. It
has consistently looked beyond the `now' and done what most others
considered impossible. For instance, when it landed the authorized
distributor deal from Compaq, it was an insignificant company, barely a
force to be reckoned with in India. Similarly, when it tied up with all
the leading players in every aspect of networking--from local to
enterprise-wide--it was doing more than just bringing world-class
networking products to India. Pradeep Kar, MD, was also communicating at
large that if the world leaders thought fit to go with MicroLand, then
MicroLand must be a company capable of delivering world-class solutions.

Every single move was pre-meditated. Like in the old days when Jenson
and Nicholson became synonymous with paints through its advertising
slogan `When you see color, think of us,' MicroLand has used the same
associating strategy with Connectivity India (CI). MicroLand effectively
exploited the potential of the CI forum to leverage its networking
solution-providing capabilities. A measure of MicroLand's success can be
gauged from the fact that, despite its size, it is associated with
companies like Wipro and TISL.

Though MicroLand is viewed with skepticism in some quarters--it is
believed that MicroLand has reached its peak and will flatten out--it is
more of a proactive company moving up the value chain more consistently
than many others. It exploited the fact that organizations moved to a
rhythm and that this would deter companies like TISL or DEIL from doing
the same. The general belief is that the associating strategy that
worked so well for networking is unlikely to work in case of Internet
India. Since the market is yet to open out, it remains a debatable
issue.

ADVANTEC'S ADVANTAGE:

Two years ago, Advantec Network Systems was hardly known but today it is
one of the fastest growing companies in the field of providing a
one-stop shop for networking solutions. No, it is not a systems
integrator. It just acts as a `via media' for the systems integrators by
stocking all the major networking products like hubs and switches.

Neither is it a master warehousing agent. Advantec is somewhere in
between the two. Today, Advantec is the single-point hub that supports,
trains, and provides just-in-time delivery and credit to over 120
systems integrators. These 120 systems integrators include the smallest
to the largest, namely, Wipro. It has spread itself over two regional
depots and 40 warehouses in India to deliver network components whenever
and wherever in the shortest possible time. Though Advantec started as a
distributor for AT&T's structured cabling Systimax--it accounts for
nearly 60 percent of AT&T's Systimax sales in India--it figured quickly
enough that the number of companies providing network solutions would go
up considerably.

It stepped in and devised ways of meeting this need early on by
concentrating on developing skills in the areas of network design,
installation, testing, and certification besides training programmes for
end-users. It acts as a consultant to its team of systems integrators,
pitching in to help them. Now leveraging on its reach, it has put its
network out for the benefit of small systems integrators to pool their
talent and resources to address large enterprise-wide networking tasks.

GODREJ'S GAINS:

Godrej nearly came to be labelled the Jack-of-all-trades,
master-of-none, for reasons more than not having a focus--it changed its
name thrice in as many years. It was into everything--from research and
development in CAD/CAM to the manufacture of printers and distribution
and marketing. It came close to losing everything but fortunately
several rounds of transformation led the company to its area of core
competency--distribution--sooner than later. A competency Godrej and
Boyce is traditionally known for.

Today, Godrej Pacific Technology Ltd (GPTL), after its joint venture
with Tech Pacific of Australia--one of the largest OA product
distribution company in Asia--is one of the largest distributors in
India. Given that distribution is now a major strategic area for most
companies in IT, GPTL can be safely said to have arrived.

INDIAN IT COMPANIES: A CASE FOR REENGINEERING

from DATAQUEST (India), Vol XIV No. 19, OCTOBER 15, 1996

If Indian IT companies desire global competitiveness and viability, it
is necessary that they transform now and wholly.

The World Competitiveness Survey of 1994 ranked India 39 out of 41
emerging economies on parameters ranging from customer responsiveness to
TQM. The recently released 1996 Update hasn't shown much change with
India ranking 46 out of 49 countries. If this is representative of the
Indian standing in global markets in general, the IT industry doesn't
fare much better. Despite the brave show put on by the software exports
industry in the face of accelerating worldwide competition, penetration
of IT within India and the ability of Indian organizations to stand
shoulder to shoulder with global leaders is still poor, with only the
odd firm standing out occasionally as an exception to the general
mediocrity that pervades the Indian IT scene.

What ails this industry? Can the entire blame be assigned to the
sluggish domestic demand or is the malaise within the industry itself?

If India is to be a force to be reckoned within the next millennium,
will a little patching and plumbing suffice or do we need fundamental
rethinking and radical redesign of the industry's business processes to
achieve a dramatic turnaround in perception and fortunes?

The case for reengineering is brought into sharp focus if we analyze the
status of the industry today and the achievements it has made in the
last few years. We see a domestic hardware industry that is on its knees
and under threat of obliteration by foreign brands, a software industry
that is still known more for its forays overseas with a service
portfolio that is only slowly shifting from body shopping and legacy
systems to leading edge technologies, and a training industry that
produces close to a million trained personnel every year but is still
making only a small dent in the demand-supply gap for international
quality software professionals.

On the other hand, the industry still has a lot going for it. The Arthur
D Little Survey for MAIT on the Competitiveness of the Indian IT
Hardware Industry for Exports mentions low labour rates, well-trained
engineers, and a large domestic market as key opportunities that can
propel Indian IT companies to worldclass status. The presence of well
organized associations in every segment of the industry--NASSCOM, MAIT,
NACT, Indian Internet Forum etc. augurs well for the collective
capability of the industry. But as the study points out, the perception
of the global customer ranges from, "Doing business with India is a
headache," to, "I would source from them if they had better quality!"
A look at the Arthur D Little perception of the weakest areas in the
Indian hardware industry compared to global brand owner expectations
show the following areas to be addressed in order of weakness.

Quality
Volume Flexibility
Delivery
Cost Reduction Ability
Management Capability
Technological Position
Communication Capability
Financial Strength
Cost

While this is based on the hardware industry, the software sector too
would exhibit a rather similar list of priority areas. And these can be
broadly classified in three areas that require drastic improvement.

A Business Processes
B Customer Responsiveness
C Infrastructural Support

If each of these areas are addressed meticulously and urgently, there is
still a chance that India can be an IT Superpower by the year 2000. Let
us see what that is going to take and who are the parties that will have
to get involved to expedite the transformation.

Reengineering Business Processes

For both the hardware and software sectors of the industry, the two key
business processes are new product development and order fulfillment.

While new product development may still be a little while away for the
hardware industry and is just being seen as crucial for the software
industry, this will be a process that will determine our long-term
success in the global arena. What is, however, crying out for immediate
reengineering is order fulfillment. Day after day, one hears horror
stories of computers delivered months after the committed date, software
contract cancellations on account of major delays, and even training
courses that finish a year later than the committed finish date. Every
Indian company must understand that delivering on time is not an option
but an imperative for international business. Comprehensive
reengineering exercises of the entire process, from the time the first
buyer-supplier handshake takes place, to the receipt of the last payment
must be done with no respect for existing functions, departments, and
non-value adding activities that inhibit on-time fulfillment.

Anticipating And Satisfying Customer Needs

The best product in the world is no good if the customer needs or
perceives he needs something else. The slow take-off of the SOHO market
in India is just one case in point of international products launched in
India with mega advertising and great fanfare only to meet with strong
disinterest from skeptical customers. The IT vendor in India is already
known as a hit-and-run salesman, more interested in closing the sale and
collecting his commission than building long term alliances with the
customer.

The venerable CK Prahlad talks about building opportunity share rather
than getting obsessed with today's market shares. The companies who
succeed or even survive into the twenty first century will be those with
a clear vision of customer needs, a commitment to satisfying and
exceeding customer expectations at all times, and building long-lasting
customer value. In the decade that this author has spent in the IT
Industry, no Indian company can truthfully claim this stature today!

Creating A Supportive Infrastructure

One of the gems that Vittal used to throw at IT chieftains was "When the
going gets tough, the tough go to the Government!" While this point is
worth noting, when it comes to improving organizations within the
existing framework, the Government too has one responsibility if it
truly wishes to see a global IT industry emerge in India--and that is to
provide at least a semblance of infrastructural support that will enable
customer response and order fulfillment to be maximized and force the
world to take India seriously. In a world where electronic data
interchange is the order of the day, email is struggling to make its
presence felt in India, and while the information superhighway is
knocking at Indian doors, the number of Internet subscribers is still to
touch the five-figure mark.

This is one activity where the industry associations have to be working
on a daily basis with the Government. Instead of attempting to be all
things to all people and spouting new jargon at every conceivable forum,
MAIT, NACT, and IIF should follow the excellent example of NASSCOM and
work hard to make the Government and their respective segments of the
industry, work together to create a better future for the entire Indian
IT industry.

Will the industry captains wake up and steer the IT ship to the promised
land or will we all flounder and see our global aspirations shattered on
the stark rocks of global realities?
