<A NAME="container"></A><H2>Container Gardening</H2>
<P>Many gardeners today are hard pressed to find the time and space for a full-blown vegetable garden. However, these limits need not constrain the resourceful gardener. Raising vegetables in containers, whether they are old buckets or fine pottery, is the answer to the apartment dweller or small-lot suburbanite who yearns for fresh homegrown veggies.</P>
<P>Container gardening saves time in soil preparation and weeding; containers can be placed virtually anywhere and can be moved easily to take advantage of available light and heat.  Gardeners with soil-borne disease problems will find containers indispensible. </P>
<P>Theoretically, any vegetable can be grown in a container, given proper care. As a practical matter some vegetables are more rewarding when raised in the confines of a container.  Moreover, some are more attractive and have neater growth habits, making them more suitable for visible locations on a deck or patio. Generally, those that have compact growth habits and yield abundant veggies that are far superior in flavor to store-bought kinds bring the most satisfying results. </P>
<P>A rich, water-retentive potting soil like Whitney Farms Premium Potting Soil or Whitney Farms Uncle Malcolm's Potting Soil is best because most vegetables need a steady supply of water and nutrients. Light but frequent fertilizing with Ellie's Ultimate Plant Food (Fish and Kelp) or a tea made from composted manure or Whitney Farms Fruit and Flower Booster will ensure adequate nutrients for the entire growing season. </P>
<P>The all-natural ingredients are released slowly and will not leach out with the frequent watering that containers need in the summer. An all-organic mix like Whitney Farms' Uncle Malcolm's Potting Soil will work great for the following suggested vegetables: </P>
Tomatoes- Several dwarf and compact types will stay small yet produce big crops in a small container.<BR> "Patio" is an old standby for small containers. You can try your favorite larger varieties in appropriately sized containers. A whiskey barrel works well for beefsteak types.<BR>
<P>Eggplant- Be sure to place these in a hot location for best results. Try the flavorful Japanese varieties in cool summer areas.<BR>
Peppers- These attractive plants double as ornamentals even before peppers ripen.<BR>
Leaf lettuce- Be sure to keep evenly moist; use blood meal for rapid growth in cool soil.<BR>
Scallions- Easy to grow; great value when compared to what supermarkets charge for them.<BR>
Garlic- Plant cloves the previous autumn for earliest harvest.<BR>
Bush beans- Go easy on the nitrogen for this and other legumes.<BR>
Bush cucumbers- Try training one up a trellis for further space savings and increased production.<BR>
<P>As a rule, select a container at least 12 inches across and 18 inches deep. Smaller containers will suffice for shallow rooted veggies like lettuce, scallions and small peppers. </P>



<A NAME="cool"></A><H2>Cool Veggies</H2>
<IMG SRC="COOL.gif" ALIGN="left">
 <P>Are you bored with beets and beans, tired of plain tomatoes, sick of zucchini? Well, the editors of The Dirt have compiled a list of cool vegetables certain to stimulate the most jaded vegetable gardener.
Now, we don't mean just those vegetables that do best during the cool months of spring and autumn. We're talking about vegetables with attitude, that break the rules, and will have your neighbors wondering what you're up to. </P>
<P>As with people, cool in vegetables is hard to pin down, but you know it when you see it. The following list is based upon the vegetable's distinctive flavor, and not least of all, its appearance. </P>
<P>Kohlrabi-These otherworldly cabbage relatives look like they could be alien beings from a B movie. They also bear a startling resemblance to the first satellite launched into space, Sputnik. Kohlrabi have a flavor similar to water chestnuts but of course are far fresher and sweeter than what you get at the store. <P>Kohlrabi are easy to grow because the edible portion, a bulbous stem, grows above the ground, beyond the reach of soil-borne insects and diseases. They even come in an extra-cool purple variety. </P>
<P>Heirloom tomatoes- Upscale nurseries and catalogs have featured "old" tomato varieties for several years now, which makes them more than a fad. And for good reason. These varieties are unsurpassed for flavor and texture, even if they can¹t match modern hybrids for productivity and shelf-life. An example:  "Brandywine," the classic Amish variety, has the cachet of their devotion to the old ways, which include, incidentally, an unwavering adherence to organic farming principles and techniques. </P>
<P>Popcorn-You can grow your own popcorn to eat while you watch a movie starring Kohlrabi. Kids will get a kick out of stomping the dry kernels off the cobs­ a fast, fun way of processing large quantities! </P>
<P>Colorful potatoes and peppers-Better garden centers will now offer yellow and blue varieties of potatoes as well as the more familiar red ones. You can grow bell peppers that ripen to purple, yellow, orange and red. The purple peppers will turn green when cooked, however. </P>
