<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>The Cost Of Waiting</STRONG></FONT><P>



<STRONG>Procrastinating Can Be Expensive</STRONG><BR>

There are plenty of excuses for not setting financial
goals; "I don't understand
investing," "I don't have the time to plan," "I can't afford to invest." Well, the
truth of the matter is, you can't
afford to delay. Early planning can help to maximize the power of time, and can
help you reach your
financial goals.
<P>
<STRONG>Time is on Your Side</STRONG><BR>

The concept of the power of time is a simple one: The sooner you begin to save for
your future financial
needs, the greater the wealth you can accumulate. Although the idea is
straightforward and logical,
most people fail to recognize the enormous increase in value that can result from
beginning to save
early. The best way to demonstrate the power of time is by way of example. Let's
take a look at the
different approaches to investing taken by twin brothers, Ken and Ray.<br>

<P>
<STRONG>Starting Early</STRONG><BR>

Ken, looking to build a large nest egg for his retirement, chose to invest $1,000
per year in an Individual
Retirement Account (IRA), starting at age 30. He continued his payments for ten
years until age 40,
earning an average of 8% per year on his investments <SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>. At age 40, he stopped
contributing to the IRA,
but left his $11,000 of contributions in the account, plus earnings, until
retirement at age 65. <P>

<SUP>1</SUP><A NAME="1"> 8% interest is for illustrative purposes only

<P>
<STRONG>Starting Late</STRONG><BR>
Ray, the second twin, was a bright guy but a bit of a procrastinator. He too saw
the need to put money
away for his retirement but didn't begin his investment plan until age 41. At that
point he began investing
$1,000 a year into an IRA. He also averaged an 8% annual return,<SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A
HREF="#1">1</A></FONT></SUP>  but he continued
to make $1,000
investments for 25 years until he retired at age 65. His contributions over the
years totaled $25,000.
<P>

<P>
<STRONG>The Dramatic Difference</STRONG><BR>
Given the fact that Ken contributed $11,000 while Ray contributed $25,000, you
might expect that the
second twin would have a significantly greater total for retirement at age 65.
Surprisingly, just the
opposite is true!
<P>
Assuming the tax-deferred IRA of each twin earned 8% a year, at age 65 the account
balance for the
first twin would be $123,000, while the second twin would have $79,000. The
preceding hypothetical
chart vividly illustrates the dramatic difference in the accumulated wealth for the
two.
<P>
<STRONG>The Cost of Waiting</STRONG><BR>
Ray was on the right track. He invested steadily and wisely, earning good returns -
his only mistake
was getting a late start. Ray invested more than twice the amount his brother did,
yet had less money to
enjoy at retirement. By getting an earlier start, Ken benefited from more years of
compounding. Left to
accumulate in his account, the earnings from his early years earned additional
returns. In other words,
"earnings earn earnings."
<P>
<STRONG>The Impact of Time and Life Insurance </STRONG><BR>
Postponing the purchase of life insurance to a perceived "better time" can also
have a definite cost of
waiting. For example, let's take a look at Trish's quandary. She's identified the
need for $250,000 of
permanent life insurance coverage. Trish is considering buying a $250,000 whole
life policy, which
would provide immediate insurance protection, and offer guaranteed cash value
accumulation that
could, in the long term, be borrowed against to fund a child's college education or
help supplement
retirement income. At age 40, her annual premium would be $4,000, but she's debating
whether or not
to wait five years, at which point her premium would be $5,000. Looking at both
scenarios over the long
term, total premium paid would balance out by age 65 ($4,000 for 25 years, and
$5,000 for 20 years
both equal $100,000). 
<P>
<STRONG>How Waiting Can Affect Cash Value, Death Benefit, and
Insurability</STRONG><BR>
Waiting would have a negative effect on several key areas. A whole life policy
offers the benefit of
tax-deferred accumulation of cash value. Generally speaking, the sooner you start,
the faster your cash
value will grow over the long term. These cash values can be accessed through
policy loans to help
meet financial needs.<P>
In addition, a whole life policy is eligible to earn dividends, if and when they
are declared by the
company. Unlike cash values, dividends are not guaranteed. Trish could use her
dividends in a variety
of beneficial ways including using them to purchase additional insurance to enhance
her total death
benefit. Waiting means missing five years of potential dividends and the
opportunity to increase the
benefit paid to her beneficiaries.<P>
Waiting five years can also place Trish's insurability in jeopardy. She's insurable
at age 40, but may be
uninsurable due to a health condition at age 45. Perhaps the greatest risk in
waiting is if she were to
die in the next five years. In that case, the cost would be the $250,000 death
benefit her beneficiaries
would not be paid. <P>
Purchasing this policy now would cost no more than waiting five years. Cash value
and death benefit,
however, should be higher. Most importantly, insurance protection would begin now.
So why should
Trish wait?
<P>
<STRONG>It's Never Too Early to Start</STRONG><BR>
Although expenses like the kids' college tuition and your own retirement may seem
like distant images,
it pays to face up to the future today. With college tuition rising at a rate of 6%
to 8% a year (the College
Board, September 1993), you'll need all the time you can muster to meet those
spiraling costs. Looking
farther down the road, a company pension and Social Security payments may not
afford the lifestyle you
desire in retirement. Your financial future is your responsibility, and with early,
careful planning, you can
make for a brighter one. As Ray discovered, waiting just a few years can mean
thousands of dollars
less waiting for you. Time can be an important investment ally. You should consider
planning and
investing, and put the power of time on your side. For ideas on putting your goals
into action, contact
