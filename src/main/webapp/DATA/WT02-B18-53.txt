Items in <i>italics</i> represent what you might type.<P>

For this search option you type the words you want to search on
into one or both of the text boxes and click on the Search button. 
Words typed into the same box are assumed to be separated by the 
boolean operator OR so typing <i>analysis study</i> into the first
 text box would retrieve citations that have the word analysis or 
the word study. You can choose the boolean operator {AND OR ANDNOT} 
with which to separate the words in the two text boxes. Typing 
<i>analysis study</i> into the first text box, selecting the AND operator, and typing
<i>recreation</i> into the second text box would retrieve citations
 that have the words analysis and recreation or the words study
 and recreation. The searches are literal so if you wanted the last search
 to pick up citations with the words studies and recreation you would have 
needed to type <i>analysis study studies</i> into the first text box. You 
can also use the wildcard character * so typing <i>stud*</i> would 
pick up study, studies, studied, among other words.<P>
