Who's doing what? The Current Status of Research on Immigration

to CA--UCLA.

<P>

26 participants<BR>


<P>

Roger Waldinger (UCLA) noted that an analysis of Census data for

Los Angles for 1970, 1980, and 1990 emphasizes that there are

far more immigrants arriving at the bottom than at the top of

the job ladder, and that especially Mexicans at the bottom are

not enjoying rapid upward mobility. A fifteen chapter book on

Ethnic Los Angeles will be published in 1996. Waldinger, Roger

and Mehdi Bozorgmehr (Eds). 1996. Ethnic Los Angeles. New York:

Russell Sage.<BR>


<P>

Dowell Myers (USC) reported on his double cohort method--by age

and year of entry-- of analyzing what happened to immigrants arriving

in the seven southern CA counties after 1980. His analysis shows

that especially young immigrants make considerable economic progress

after their arrival--as measured by their total incomes--and that

some of their behavior converges rapidly to that of natives, e.g.,

they rapidly abandon buses and drive cars to work. In southern

CA, one-third of all bus riders are recent immigrants.<BR>


<P>

Myers noted that immigration is raising other issues, including

overcrowded housing. The US definition of acceptable housing was

two or less persons per room until 1960, when the definition was

change to one or less per room. However, as immigrants moved into

southern CA, overcrowding jumped, raising questions about how

aggressively cities should enforce housing codes developed during

a non-immigrant era.<BR>


<P>

George Vernez (Rand) outlined an ambitious project that is dealing

with the question of whether immigration is, on balance, a plus

or minus for CA by examining the effects of immigration on internal

migration, on wages, and on public sector finances since 1960.

These studies show that immigrants from most countries do catch

up to similar natives in average weekly earnings after 10 to 20

years, but not immigrants from the major country of origin--Mexico.

Furthermore, immigrant children tend to follow in their parents'

footsteps, meaning that the children of Asian immigrants tend

to do well in school, etc., while the children of Mexican immigrants

do not.<BR>


<P>

The Mexican lag may be even more severe if Mexicans tend to report

a more recent arrival date than they actually arrived. For example,

many Mexicans who may have arrived in the US before 1987 reported

in the 1990 Census that they arrived in 1987, the year that they

applied for legalization. It was also noted that, in the three

major industrial democracies of France, Germany, and the US, the

largest immigrant group--Algerians, Turks, and Mexicans--seem

to do &quot;worst&quot; on most integration measures.<BR>


<P>

Hans Johnson (CA PPI) reported that the institute has a number

of immigration projects underway, including an examination of

internal migration patterns, Mexican return migration, and the

effects of Prop 187 on prenatal care.<BR>

Operation Gatekeeper and other Border Control Efforts? How well

are they working? CA Research Bureau

<H2><A NAME="_Toc359118700">Does Gatekeeper Deter Illegal Immigration?</A>

</H2>


<P>

Mexico devalued the peso in December 1994, and 1995 was a year

of economic crisis in Mexico. More Mexicans attempted illegal

entry into the US, and the US responded with a series of border

control operations designed to prevent illegal border crossings--

Operation Gatekeeper in California, Operation Hold-the-Line in

Texas, and Operation Safeguard in Arizona. As one result, apprehensions

increased sharply in 1995-- some 1,381,465 foreigners were apprehended

by the US Border Patrol in calendar year 1995, up 43 percent from

965,144 in 1994.<BR>


<P>

Do increased apprehensions reflect the success of the Border Patrol

in apprehending a stable or declining number of aliens attempting

entry, or do they reflect more aliens attempting unauthorized

entry? Most surveys suggest that the probability of apprehension

on any attempt to enter the US without inspection is about 30

percent--in the Westat survey of 6,200 newly legalized aliens

conducted in 1989, for example, 74 percent of those in the US

illegally before January 1, 1982 reported that they had never

apprehended.<BR>


<P>

Manuel Garcia y Griego showed that the probability of successful

entry is very high for persistent aliens despite stepped up border

controls. Assuming that each entry attempt is an independent effort--meaning

that the probability of apprehension does not change from one

illegal entry attempt to the next-- if the probability of apprehension

is 30 percent on any attempted illegal entry, then 99 percent

of the aliens attempting entry will succeed after four attempted

entries.<BR>

<P>

Suppose that more Border Patrol agents, fences, and lights increase

the probability of apprehension to 70 percent on any attempted

entry. In this case, about 73 percent of the aliens who attempt

to enter will succeed after four attempts, and 78 percent after

five attempts. In other words, border control efforts work only

if they change the behavior of aliens--if those apprehended &quot;give

up&quot; and return home, thereby discouraging others from attempting

illegal entry. <BR>

</TABLE>


<P>

The Border Patrol's Gatekeeper operation fingerprints and photographs

all aliens apprehended, so that apprehension data for the first

time can be used to estimate recidivism rates. Unofficial Gatekeeper

data in the winter of 1995-96 suggest that about 30 percent of

those caught once are caught again, which suggests that the probability

of successfully entering the US on any attempt may be as high

as 70 percent, especially if most aliens who are apprehended keep

on trying, as empirical studies suggest they do.<BR>


<P>

If border controls were deterring aliens, then there should be

reports of labor shortages and rising wages in the industries

that are known to employ recently arrived unauthorized immigrants.

But there are few such reports. For example, reports from the

single most labor-intensive activity in North American agriculture

in Fall 1995--the harvest of about 200,000 acres of raisin grapes

around Fresno, California from mid-August to October-- found that

newly arrived workers were getting into the US and going to work

despite Gatekeeper. <BR>


<P>

Unauthorized raisin harvesters reported in September 1995 that

some are still entering the US illegally on their first attempt.

Of those apprehended, most persisted, and succeeded after two

or three attempts. Aliens who used smugglers reported that smugglers'

fees rose from $200 to $300 in 1994 to $300 to $400 in 1995. However,

the workers major complaint was not the higher smuggling fees--it

was the fact that they lost days of work in the US because of

delays in crossing the border.<BR>


<P>

Higher smuggling fees may not be much of a deterrent because,

in most cases, the unauthorized border crossing is financed by

family members in the United States, rather than by the migrants

themselves.

<H2><A NAME="_Toc359118701">US Immigration Reforms</A> </H2>


<P>

Philip Martin summarized the status of immigration reform pending

in Congress. The House was set to take up in March a bill that

would beef-up-the-border and add new bars to access by illegal

aliens to education and welfare. The bill as approved would double

the Border Patrol from 5,000 to 10,000 agents by the year 2000,

authorize the construction of a 14-mile triple fence on the US-Mexican

border south of San Diego, and set up a five-state pilot project

that would permit employers to verify the work eligibility of

all new hires by checking a computer data base.

<P>

To cut down on the use of false documents, the bill would reduce

from 29 to six the documents that workers can present to employers

to prove their legal status, and treats document forgers as harshly

as money counterfeiters. The bill would also permit the imposition

of fines of $50 to $250 on people caught inside the US illegally,

and permits state and local law enforcement officials to detain

illegal aliens until the INS can take custody of them.

<P>

The House was also scheduled to debate a proposal by CA growers

to enact a new guest worker program. Under the Pombo proposal,

growers, labor contractors, or associations wanting to employ

foreign farm workers would have to file at least 25 days before

the job was to begin a labor condition attestation (LCA) with

their state Employment Service office listing the number of foreigners

requested and when work was to begin. Local ES offices would review

these LCAs &quot;only for completeness and obvious inaccuracies&quot;

within seven days after they are filed. Employers violating their

attestations or program rules can be assessed civil money penalties,

and be debarred from the program.

<P>

To encourage returns, 25 percent of the foreign workers' wages

would be placed into a federal trust fund managed by the INS,

which foreign workers could reclaim with interest in their country

of origin. Foreign workers would be limited to a maximum two years

in the US. Program costs would be financed by employer contributions

equivalent to Social Security and unemployment insurance taxes

that would not be paid by growers.

Internal Migration and Unauthorized Immigration, and Dealing with

Criminal Aliens--CA Research Bureau

<P>

26 participants

<H2><A NAME="_Toc359118703">Domestic and Unauthorized Migration</A>

</H2>


<P>

California in July 1995 had an estimated 32 million residents,

reflecting 569,000 births in 1994-95, 222,000 deaths, 260,000

net foreign immigrants, and a net 334,000 CA residents who moved

to other states. According to the CA Department of Finance, the

net number of CA residents moving to other states exceeded the

net number of immigrants to CA in 1992-93, 1993-94, and 1994-95.

<BR>


<P>

CA projects the population of each of the state's 58 counties

by asking counties to report any changes that are likely to significantly

affect their growth rates. The last series of projections was

done in 1993; a new series is planned for 1997.<BR>


<P>

During the 1980s, California gained a net 1.25 million residents

from the other 49 states. Between 1990 and 1995, California lost

a net 1.55 million residents to other states. CA thus experienced

a &quot;turning point&quot; in domestic migration--switching from

a net recipient of domestic migrants to a source of domestic migrants.

<BR>


<P>

Hans Johnson of the PPI examined patterns of migration to and

from CA between 1980 and 1993 and, contrary to some earlier estimates,

found that US-born residents began to move out of CA in the late

1980s, but that CA's population kept growing during this economic

boom period because of previously underestimated unauthorized

immigration--a peak 200,000 unauthorized aliens are believed to

have arrived in CA in 1989, versus the 125,000 per year estimated

by Bob Warren for the 1989-1992 period.. <BR>


<P>

Between 1985 and 1990, CA residents with lower than average levels

of education and income moved to nearby western states, while

college graduates from the east coast and midwest moved to CA.

These domestic migration patterns continued in the early 1990s.

<BR>


<P>

Johnson's research raises three issues:

<UL>

<LI>What is the best method for estimating unauthorized migration.

Johnson uses a residual technique, in which unauthorized migration

is the unexplained part of population change after births, deaths,

and net domestic and legal migration are accounted for. The most

common alternative methods for estimating illegal immigration

are apprehension methods--assuming that the number of persons

detected by the INS is a partial measure of an underlying flow.

<LI>Patterns of domestic and foreign migration change over time

in response to changing conditions in CA, other states, and other

countries. Which models provide the best estimates at inflection

points, e.g., when CA turns from being a net recipient to a net

source of domestic migrants?

<LI>WHY do US residents enter and leave CA? Are the persons at

the bottom of the education and income ladders pushed out of CA

by immigrants, as Bill Frey suggests? Does CA continue to attract

college-educated US residents because the unskilled immigrants

are complements to such labor in the CA economy, as many production

function models suggest? 

</UL>


<H2><A NAME="_Toc359118704">Dealing with Alien Offenders</A> 

</H2>


<P>

Every year, hundreds of millions of people enter the US via land

ports of entry, and the INS each year apprehends over 1.3 million

aliens at or near the border. Over 90 percent of those apprehended

near the border are Mexicans, and some who enter the US legally

and illegally are carrying drugs into the US.<BR>


<P>

The US Attorney for San Diego, Alan Bersin, was named &quot;border

czar&quot; in October 1995, and given responsibility for coordinating

US law enforcement efforts along the 2,000 mile US-Mexican border.

Bersin implemented a Deferred Prosecution Program that, under

certain circumstances, permits aliens who have been apprehended

with drugs--so-called drug mules-- to be subject to an administrative

exclusion proceeding in which green cards, border crossing cards,

and other entry documents are seized, and the alien is prohibited

from re-entering the US. 

<P>

If the alien does re-enter the US and is apprehended, then the

alien is subject to prosecution for the new offense, as well as

the original offense that led to the exclusion--the deferred prosecution.

<P>

The intent of the DPP is to preserve limited federal prosecutors'

funds for &quot;serious&quot; offenses, including prosecuting

aliens who return after being excluded in the DPP process. Experience

so far indicates that DPP is successful in deterring the re-entry

of &quot;drug mules;&quot; of those excluded, very few have been

re-apprehended in the US.

<P>

In May 1996, the DPP was criticized sharply by Republican politicians

for allegedly returning to Mexico aliens with up to 125 pounds

of marijuana; the Los Angeles Times reported that 1,000 smuggling

suspects had been returned to Mexico under DPP since 1994. Most

law enforcement officials support DPP's policy of seizing immigration

documents of first-time, small-quantity offenders, rather than

prosecute them for misdemeanors.

<P>

It is not yet clear what the long-run effects of DPP will be.

Loss of legal border crossing documents can be a serious economic

loss to a Mexican national, and immigration lawyers may point

out to those apprehended that they should take their chances with

a US jury rather than surrender their greencards etc. 

<P>

Such a tactic may doom the program's deterrent effects, since,

in most cases, the sentence for a first offense on drug smuggling

is 90 or 120 days, which is typically the time already served

by an alien held over for trial.

<P>

If this were to happen, federal prosecutors would need more resources

to deal both with aliens who elect to contest the charges against

them, and to pursue felony prosecutions of aliens who return after

being excluded in DPP proceedings.
