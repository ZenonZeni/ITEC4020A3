<STRONG>HOLLAND</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
* * * * * The prime minister of Holland, Wim Kok, some weeks ago on the
radio denied all the criticism about the failures of Dutch Drug Policy.
He feels that Holland has the right to solve their problems their own way.
<BR>
<BR>
* * * * * There are no known health records or scientific research work
in the field of cannabis abuse in the Netherlands. Dutch people in general
hate statistics and insight in their private life. <BR>
<BR>
* * * * * The HIV/AIDs is a big problem. Statistics are not known, but there
are many institutions to help HIV patients and abusers survive. <BR>
<BR>
* * * * * An urgent appeal from &quot;Concerned Citizens&quot; (LCD) in
the Netherlands -- The situation in the Netherlands is quite desperate,
and they have every right to cry out for help. On June 5th, 1996, LCD will
hold a conference meeting at Congrescentrum Rolduc, not far from the German
and Belgian border. Anyone wishing more information please contact: <BR>
<BR>
<H4>Dr. L.P. Dorenbos, co-ordinator Fax + 31-35-624-9141</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
(If you cannot attend, please fax a letter of support to &quot;Concerned
Citizens.&quot; Letters from around the world showing our support will be
extremely important.) <BR>
<BR>
* * * * * The Dutch drug liberals will recede more into the background as
their opponents get stronger and stronger. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>ICELAND</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Equal Education&quot; (Jafningja Fraesla) is a project involving age
16- 20. Young people point out how life can be fun without drugs, to make
it uncool to use drugs, to turn the spotlight on the positive things young
people are doing. <BR>

<BR>
<STRONG>INTERPOL</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Mr. Raymond Kendal, Secretary General of Interpol, France, is well known
for his drug permissive ideas. He has been invited to speak at the 7th International
Conference on the Reduction of Drug Related Harm, March 2-7, 1996, in Australia.
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>EU</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
On the 17th of April the European Parliament voted about drug prevention
for the second time in 6 months. There was strong debate. The drug liberals
were thoroughly beaten. It was a tremendous breakthrough for a restrictive
drug policy for the whole of Europe. No money can be used for decriminalization
activities, no money for methadone prescriptions or programs, no money for
free needle exchange, no money for &quot;harm reduction.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>EURAD</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
The chairman of Europe Against Drugs, Mrs. Grainne Kenny, has lobbied academics
and parent leaders throughout Europe and America to support Dr. Nahas, who
has given us all such great support on our work down the years. Good luck
the 25th of May! <BR>
<BR>
Renee asked for information about Khat. She has a presentation in the late
summer about KHAT in the world. Please send information to: <BR>

<H2><CENTER>Update from Renee -- May 16, 1996 Information about Holland.</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<P>a) as from influx of cannabis into the Netherlands in the sixties an
increase to 675,000 regular cannabis users; number of young cannabis users
between 12 and 18 were estimated in 1992 on 60,000: young people start using
cannabis at an younger age; schools are more and more the target; <BR>
<BR>
b) from 1984 to 1992 cannabis use in the age from 12-18 has tripled; <BR>
<BR>
c) percentage cannabis users in the age from 11-18 has more than doubled
from 1990-1995 (from 7 to 17 %), in the age from 11-13 it was quadrupled
in that time (from 1 -4 %) <BR>
<BR>
d) coffeeshops selling cannabis increased in the eighties to 1200 in the
strict sense with an additional 800 affiliate sales points; the separation
of markets on which the concept of tolerance versus coffeeshops was based
is in reality wishful thinking, an illusion; <BR>
<BR>
e) a-d are especially worrying, cannabis being a dangerous drug: (death
of some persons followed); <BR>
<BR>
g) the 1995 annual report of the International Narcotics Control Boards
mentions the Netherlands as a significant producer of cannabis cultivated
indoors and as the major supplier of hallucinogenic amphetamines in Europe.
