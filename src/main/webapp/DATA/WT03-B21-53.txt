<p>Bonny was a rental horse who was being ridden on an hourly basis like thousands of other horses every day, but the stable owner was renting Bonny out even though she was suffering severe pain with a broken back.  No one seemed to notice even though she would rear up or resist being saddled.  It wasn't until the Humane Society rescued Bonny that she had any hope for the future.  They brought Bonny to Redwings Horse Sanctuary where she will live out the remainder of her days with the promise that no one will ever ride on her back again.</p>

<p> When Bonny arrived at the sanctuary, the veterinarian to x-rays and discovered that her back was fractured in three different places.  She received all the best care and attention, including acupuncture and deep body massage.</p>

<p>Today Bonny has a happy life at Redwings.  It is a joy to watch her run through the pastures with her mane flying in the wind!</p>
