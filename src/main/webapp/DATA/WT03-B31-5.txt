NYC SPECIAL ED PANEL RELEASES FINAL REPORT

The number of disabled students who attend regular classes
in New York City could rise dramatically under a reform
proposal by an independent panel.

More than 60 percent of the city's disabled students ages
six through 11 -- three times the national average -- now go
to public school in restrictive settings.

Too many students, especially those with mild disabilities,
are dumped into special education classes because regular
education teachers lack the capacity to meet their needs,
says the New York University (NYU) team that wrote the
report.

Funding Change Critical

Like a preliminary version released last summer, the report
recommends scrapping New York state's special education
funding formula (ED, May 30, 1995).

The panel says the current formula rewards schools for
segregating disabled students and should be replaced by an
"enrichment allocation" that each school could use to
improve services for all students, including those who are
disabled and at risk of failure.

The new report modifies the draft version's suggestion that
all special education and compensatory education funding
streams be merged.  The final report calls for preserving
the formula for students with severe disabilities.

It also expands on earlier recommendations that teacher
preparation programs address special education in basic
courses.

Former New York City schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines
requested the study as part of an effort to trim special ed
costs.

Nearly a quarter of the city's public school budget goes
toward educating 140,000 special education students.

The report suggests that its proposals could yield savings
by cutting transportation costs and reducing the need for
evaluations.

"The cost of evaluating, transporting, tracking, re-
evaluating, mainstreaming and de-certifying students who may
not be disabled is siphoning resources from a resource-
starved public education system," said Norm Fruchter, head
of the university team and co-director of the NYU Institute
for Education and Social Policy.

Rudolph Crew, who has replaced Cortines as the city's school
chief, said the report, "Focus on Learning," will be sent to
a variety of groups for review.

Education and Social Policy, New York University, 285 Mercer

STUDENTS POOR AT EXPLAINING MATH, SCIENCE REASONING

While students worldwide can solve hands-on problems, they
have trouble explaining their answers, according to the
largest study ever of mathematics and science achievement.

Many students could show that light exercise boosts the
heart rate, for instance, but few were able to explain why
or how they reached that conclusion, say researchers
processing results from the Third International Mathematics
and Science Study (TIMSS).

"Writing something out clarifies your thinking," said
Maryellen Harmon, the study's international coordinator of
performance assessment, who previewed some preliminary
findings for Education Daily.

Over the past two years, TIMSS has posed traditional
multiple-choice questions and presented a series of
performance assessment tasks to elementary and secondary
students in 45 nations.

While the eagerly awaited TIMSS results won't be released
until September, field trials of 22 performance tasks
conducted in 19 countries in the summer of 1994 shed light
on weaknesses in students' math and science writing around
the world, Harmon added.

"Students need to learn to communicate, in English or
Norwegian or whatever language they speak, about anything
and everything that is important to them," she said, urging
educators to demand that students write every day in every
subject.

National Assessment of Educational Progress findings on U.S.
students released last year -- showing mild gains in science
and math, but hardly a ripple in reading and writing --
point up the relevance of Harmon's observations for American
children (ED, Aug. 18, 1994).

The Write Stuff?

"Students like to problem-solve, and they have a notion of
how to go about it, and they go about it well," Harmon said,
lauding nine- and 13-year-olds' showing on problems, such as
conducting laboratory experiments or arranging blocks to
solve math puzzles.

"Children of this age don't like to write," however, she
lamented.

Based on her 40 years of experience teaching U.S. students
in a range of subjects, Harmon said she wasn't surprised to
find students largely unable to put their thoughts on paper.

When a nation leans heavily on high-stakes, multiple-choice
tests, it offers students little incentive to refine their
communications skills, she said in an interview.

Means To An End

While only 27 of the 45 nations participating in TIMSS --
including the United States -- are using the performance
assessment part of the test, that number represents a step
forward for that type of evaluation, Harmon said.

Only six countries used such techniques in the previous math
and science survey about a decade ago by the Netherlands-
based International Association for the Evaluation of
Educational Research (ED, March 29, 1994).

The multiple-choice and short-answer items that make up most
of TIMSS reveal little more than whether students can
thoughtfully choose or guess correct answers, but
performance tasks enable assessors and educators to
"diagnose" problems in student performance, said Eugene
Gonzalez, TIMSS director of operations and data analysis.

"We can see the process that the student follows to get the
answer to a question, rather than just the product," he
said.

The performance aspect of TIMSS makes the test not only a
tool for comparing countries, but an engine for school
improvement, providing curriculum designers and teachers
insights about trouble spots, Gonzalez added.

It also helped the study cater to the varied curricular
emphases different nations brought to math and science, said
Ina Mullis, deputy director of TIMSS's international
headquarters at Boston College.

The hands-on format proved agreeable to educators from
Denmark, who claim their students never have taken a
multiple-choice test, and to those from Austria, where many
students spend more time on job training sites than in
schools, Mullis said.

Inequities Unclear

TIMSS turned up mixed findings on gender differences,
contrary to the conventional wisdom among U.S. researchers
that boys regularly outperform girls in science and math.

But socioeconomic and racial or ethnic disparities are
difficult to gauge in an international study, since
countries have varied ideas about what constitutes a poor
standard of living or a minority.   -- Geoff Camphire

REPORT FAULTS NEW YORK CITY FOR MINORITY, LD PLACEMENT

New York City public schools place too many black students
in special education, and improperly label other students as
learning disabled, an independent review panel says.

Those charges -- frequently leveled against special
education programs around the country -- are part of a new
report calling for major changes to the city's general and
special education systems.

The researchers found that black studentsin New York City
are placed in self-contained classes almost twice as often
as whites.

For every white student, there are 1.93 black students in
the total population.  But for every white, 3.74 blacks are
placed in self-contained classes.

And in schools where fewer than 20 percent of students are
black, the black referral rate to self-contained classes is
four times the rate for whites, they say.

Citing a 1985 study of New York City school children, they
said just 16 percent of 133 children labeled as learning
disabled met the criterion for that disability as stipulated
in state regulations.

In a follow-up study in 1992, researchers found that 15
percent of 175 students met the clinical definition of
learning disabled.

The report was compiled last year by five New York
University education specialists for former New York City
Chancellor Ramon Cortines.

LEGISLATIVE UPDATE

Congress and President Clinton will continue work this week
on a compromise to balance the budget in seven years.  In
the meantime, many federal agencies, including the Education
Department, will remain closed.

Awaiting the President's Signature ...

School Meals

H.R. 4: The House-Senate welfare reform bill would allow up
to seven states to receive school meals money in a block
grant over the next five years.

Last action: The House passed the bill, 245-178, on Dec. 21.
The Senate passed it the following day, 52-47.

Next action:  President Clinton has yet to receive H.R. 4,
but says he will veto it.

Recent or Upcoming Action ...

Budget Limits/Student Loan Cuts

H.R. 2491:  Congress's budget-balancing bill would have cut,
then capped, domestic discretionary spending -- which
includes most education programs -- at $219.7 billion this
year and kept it there for six more years.  It also called
for saving $4.5 billion in student loan spending, mostly by
limiting Direct Student Loan volume (ED, Nov. 15).  The bill
also would have trimmed school meal reimbursement rates.

Last action:  The president and the House and Senate
majority leaders met Friday, hoping by Saturday to have a
framework for budget negotiations.

Next action:  Talks are expected to resume this week.

Fiscal 1996 Appropriations

H.R. 2127:  The House version would cut money Congress
appropriates for Education Department programs by $3.6
billion from last year's funding, to $23.2 billion in fiscal
1996.  The bill would reduce Title I school district grants
by $1.1 billion and Safe and Drug-Free Schools grants by
$282 million.  Spending on student loans and other programs
would raise ED's budget to $27 billion (ED, July 13).  The
Senate's bill would reduce ED appropriations by $2.1
billion, to $24.7 billion, including cuts of $679 million
from Title I and $66 million from Safe and Drug-Free schools
(ED, Sept. 14).  President Clinton's initial fiscal 1996
budget proposal would have raised ED appropriations 4
percent (ED, Feb. 7).

Last action:  Temporary funding for ED and several other
agencies expired Dec. 15.  House Republicans want to keep ED
-- and other agencies without fiscal 1996 spending bills --
closed until Clinton and Congress agree to a plan to balance
the budget in seven years.  The House passed H.R. 2127 in
August, but the Senate version is stalled over health and
labor policy.

Next action:  Senators probably won't take up their bill
until Congress begins a new session late this month.

Just Introduced ...

Higher Education Reform

H.R. 2834:  Would amend the Higher Education Act to improve
programs' accountability.

Last action:  Introduced by Rep. Ron Klink, D-Pa., on Dec.
22;  referred to the House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee.

Next action:  No action is scheduled.
