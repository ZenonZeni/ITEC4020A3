<P>On the anniversary of Home School Legal Defense Association's tenth year of service to the<BR>
home school community, we want to take time to reflect on the past decade remembering the<BR>
joys and sorrows, the bitterness of defeat and the sweet celebration of victories.  Anniversaries are<BR>
also times to look ahead, to chart our course, and to prepare for the future. <BR>

<P>Marking the Milestones is our tribute to the pioneers of the home-schooling movement who<BR>
blazed the trail for those who have followed.  It is our monument to the courage, vision, and<BR>
steadfastness of the parents who stood firm in the face of adversity.  It is our vision for the future. <BR>
And it is our testimony to the greatness of our God.  He truly is our protector!<BR>

<P><i>I will remember the deeds of the Lord; yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.  I will<BR>
meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds.  <B>Psalm 77:11-12</i></B><BR>

<h3>Home School Legal Defense Association: A Ten Year Perspective</h3><BR>
Ten years ago, when Michael Farris and Michael Smith founded Home School Legal Defense<BR>
Association in March of 1983, home schooling was just a tiny blip on the education radar screen. <BR>
The concept of parents teaching their children at home was relatively obscure at that time.  The<BR>
families who chose to follow this non-traditional education route were fairly certain to face<BR>
opposition from the educational bureaucracy and following legal entanglements, as well as from<BR>
their own friends and family.<BR>

<P>Looking back over the years it is amazing to see how Home School Legal Defense Association<BR>
has grown and developed, and how God has led us to where we are today.  HSLDA started with<BR>
a handful of member families, Michael Farris working from his home in Olympia, Washington, and<BR>
Michael Smith from his law office in Santa Monica, California.  Shortly thereafter, Michael Farris<BR>
was hired to head up the legal department for Concerned Women for America in Washington,<BR>
DC.  He moved his family east, and the HSLDA &quot;office&quot; relocated in Fort Worth, Texas.  In<BR>
1984, Attorney Jordan Lorence was hired to work two part-time jobs; one half of his time was<BR>
devoted to HSLDA, the other half to CWA.  At that time the membership records were<BR>
transferred from Fort Worth to Washington, DC.  Within a year, Home School Legal Defense<BR>
Association's membership had grown to the point that a real office and a full time staff were<BR>
needed. Melinda Allen was HSLDA's first full-time employee, followed by Christopher Klicka<BR>
who was hired as HSLDA's executive director to handle membership services and legal contacts. <BR>
Michael Farris was full-time by the fall of 1986, and Michael Smith by March of 1987.<BR>

<P>Today, Home School Legal Defense Association employs over thirty staff in both full-time and<BR>
part-time positions.  Our office is now in Purcellville, Virginia, about 50 miles west of<BR>
Washington, DC.<BR>
All six of HSLDA's attorneys are home-schooling dads. Among our current staff, we are home<BR>
schooling, or have finished home schooling, 32 children.  Four home school graduates work for us<BR>
in various staff positions, as well as several others who work for us part time.  Defending home<BR>
schoolers is not just a job for us it is our very way of life and our heartfelt conviction.<BR>

<P>Although HSLDA has changed in the past ten years in terms of the size of our membership, the<BR>
number of staff, and our physical location our original vision and purpose remains unchanged. <BR>
HSLDA exists expressly for the purpose of defending the rights of home-schooling parents.<BR>

<P>During the last decade home schooling has been recognized as &quot;legal&quot; in every state.  Each state<BR>
varies, however, as to the manner in which it restricts the right of parents to teach their children at<BR>
home.  Because of vague or overly-restrictive laws, many parents still face criminal prosecution<BR>
every year.  Today, just as ten years ago, the enormous expense of legal defense in such situations<BR>
can intimidate families into moving, or even abandoning home schooling.  HSLDA, by bringing<BR>
together a large number of home-schooling families, enables each family to have a low-cost<BR>
method of obtaining quality legal defense.<BR>

<P>The cost of membership in Home School Legal Defense Association, $100.00 annually per family,<BR>
has not increased in eight years. Although our costs of operation have risen dramatically, the<BR>
number of families who have joined makes it possible for us to maintain the $100.00 cost of<BR>
membership per family.<BR>

<P>The National Center for Home Education was founded by HSLDA in February 1990, to serve<BR>
state leaders by providing information about state and federal legislation of concern to home<BR>
schoolers.  The National Center also works on special public relations projects related to home<BR>
schooling and functions as a &quot;clearing house&quot; of major home school research and other news and<BR>
resources regarding home schooling.  In January 1993, the National Center launched the<BR>
Congressional Action Program (CAP) in response to the concern raised by many home school<BR>
families over the direction of the Clinton Administration's policy regarding parental rights and<BR>
education reform.  The mission of CAP is to target action for federal measures which have a<BR>
direct impact on home schooling.<BR>

<P>In the fall of 1991, HSLDA of Canada was launched in response to repeated calls for assistance<BR>
from Canadian home schoolers.  Americans and Canadians share common legal traditions.  Many<BR>
of the constitutional principles relevant to home schooling are well established in Canadian<BR>
constitutional law. We are greatly encouraged to be able to begin helping home schoolers in<BR>
Canada, who have many similar problems to the ones we experience here in the United States. <BR>
HSLDA of Canada is a separate, sister organization to HSLDA, USA, and our goal is for it to<BR>
become entirely self-sufficient.<BR>

<P>Home School Legal Defense Association's original vision was to help home schoolers and only<BR>
home schoolers, and we have remained faithful to that vision.   We are committed to the overall<BR>
success and advancement of home education in the arenas of the courts, education, the media,<BR>
Congress, state legislatures, churches, families, and neighborhoods.  And we are committed to<BR>
providing you with our very best efforts to enable you to home school your children in peace and<BR>
freedom for the years to come!<BR>

<B>Remembering HSLDA: the Good, the Bad, the Inspiring</B><BR>
Recently, we spent time reminiscing about the history of the Home School Legal Defense<BR>
Association with  &quot;old-timers&quot; Michael P. Farris, J. Michael Smith, and Christopher J. Klicka. <BR>
We discussed the early years of HSLDA, the way home schooling has changed, and some of their<BR>
most memorable cases.  We found their stories quite interesting . . .<BR>

<P>What are some of the events that led up to HSLDA's founding?<BR>
Farris: Vickie and I decided to home school our daughter Christy.  We had independently heard<BR>
messages about home schooling, and we talked about it and decided that we would try it for a<BR>
year.  When the word got out that we were home schooling our children, I started getting a lot of<BR>
phone calls.<BR>

<P>Smith:  I'd been working with CHEA of California for some time, ever since I started home<BR>
schooling in 1981.  I had a meeting with Mike Farris in Sacramento at a home school conference. <BR>
He was looking for someone to found the organization with him, and one of the founders of<BR>
CHEA recommended me.  Mike explained the concept, and I said I thought it would work.  That<BR>
must have been in 1982. <BR>
I was representing mostly California families at that time, by writing letters and making phone<BR>
calls.  I'd hate to go back and look at some of those letters today, but they worked<BR>
then miraculously.<BR>

<P>What were some of the cases that HSLDA handled in 1983?<BR>
Farris: Our first actual case was when we filed a constitutional challenge against the Washington<BR>
state law.  That was a test case.  While the case was pending, the Washington legislature changed<BR>
the law and passed the current home school law there.<BR>

<P>I do remember another really early case.  The child had been in the public school around<BR>
Vancouver, Washington, for kindergarten and first grade and had come out of public school<BR>
testing below grade level.  The mom home schooled for two years and the child was then scoring<BR>
around the 8th or 9th grade level about four grades above grade level in almost all subjects. <BR>
The prosecutor was initiating a case of criminal prosecution for truancy against the family because<BR>
home schooling if you weren't a certified teacher was illegal in Washington state at the time at<BR>
least according to government officials. So I told the prosecutor, &quot;Good, go ahead and file the<BR>
case. We are looking for a test case.  If you do file it, we'll give this nine year old the GED and<BR>
once he passes, what are you going to do then?&quot;  I never heard from the prosecutor again.  So<BR>
that case is still technically pending.  (I don't think they're going to pursue it because by now the<BR>
child would be nineteen or twenty years old.)<BR>

<P>How many families were members that first year?<BR>
Farris:  At the end of the first year there were about 200 member families.  We got the word out<BR>
by going to a few home school conferences in Dallas, Sacramento, and Portland.  The main<BR>
problem to overcome the first year was that we didn't have any staff to speak of.  It was basically<BR>
all volunteer efforts.  I remember running the first year's problems out of our house in Olympia<BR>
before we moved to Washington, DC.  I did a whole lot of phoning: &quot;Hello, this is Home School<BR>
Legal Defense Association . . . &quot; <BR>

<P>Smith:  One of the early challenges was that we didn't have any paid lawyers the first year or<BR>
two. Jordan came in 1984 part time, then we hired Melinda Allen as our first full time employee,<BR>
and Chris came in June of 1985 as the first time full time legal staff member. We didn't have too<BR>
many members at that time.  Mike Farris and I had divided up the states to address legal contacts. <BR>
He had east of the Mississippi and I had west of the Mississippi.  Board meetings were held over<BR>
the telephone.   <BR>

<P>At what point did your &quot;part time&quot; project overtake your full time life?<BR>
Farris:  I frankly thought that the organization was going to take off.  I thought HSLDA would<BR>
get to be an organization of about 10,000 people the first year, year and a half, because I thought<BR>
all the home schoolers would join.  Instead, we had slow growth rather than rapid growth.  The<BR>
reality was that if the organization had grown as rapidly as I thought it was going to grow, I<BR>
would never have left Washington state.  Because it failed to grow rapidly, we moved to Virginia<BR>
so that I could work with Concerned Women for America and have a paying job. But I am<BR>
absolutely confident that that was a way for us to get direction.  I am confident that's where we're<BR>
supposed to be and that would not have happened if we'd had the initial rapid growth that I<BR>
anticipated.<BR>

<P>Smith:  When we started the organization, I never thought about working full time for HSLDA. <BR>
But I moved to Virginia in March of '87, because I was interested in doing this kind of work and<BR>
in getting out of California with my little ones.  In spring of '87, I recall having 3,600 members.  I<BR>
think 30-40% were California members.<BR>

<P>What brought you to HSLDA?<BR>
Klicka:  My general goal was always to go into just constitutional law, like Concerned Women<BR>
for America or the Rutherford Institute.  In the summer of 1984 I had worked as an intern for<BR>
John Whitehead, and my project was doing an analysis of all the state laws and court decisions <BR>
regarding home schooling.  I started sending out resumes the second half of 1985, and I sent one<BR>
to Mike Farris for a job at CWA for religious freedom issues.  I got a response within three days. <BR>
Mike said, &quot;I'd like to interview you, I've started this organization called Home School Legal<BR>
Defense Association.  You know more about home-schooling laws than I do.&quot;  Mike and Jordan<BR>
were coming down to Tulsa within the next month to speak at an education seminar.  I met them<BR>
and was interviewed. I liked them; they liked me.  The following week they flew me down to meet<BR>
Jim Carden in Texas.  They hired me. As soon as I graduated in May, I went straight to DC and<BR>
started working part time while I studied for the bar examination.  I came on full time in August<BR>
after the bar.  I've worked here full time ever since.  <BR>

<P>What do you remember most about the early days? <BR>
Klicka:  Fear.  People were afraid.  Families wanted to know if it was legal.  Many times I<BR>
couldn't say it was legal, except from a constitutional perspective that they had the right to do<BR>
it.  So we would just assert that regardless of whether the state made it legal or not, parents have<BR>
the right to home school.  The state is simply wrong, and the excessive restrictions on home<BR>
schooling are unconstitutional.<BR>
It was at that point that I put together the chart of the 50 states to give people some basis as to<BR>
how they could legally home school.  It forced me to look at each state to figure out, &quot;Can they<BR>
be a private school?&quot; &quot;Is there a home school law?&quot; &quot;How do we get around approval?&quot;  And that<BR>
was what we were trying to do in those summaries.  We'd send them out to folks who called.<BR>

<P>When did you begin to sense that the fear was alleviated?  Was it a gradual process or was<BR>
there a definite break point?<BR>
Klicka:  Well, from '85 on, we saw a pretty steady gain in the legislatures.  Up until 1990, three<BR>
to four states per year were changing their laws.  By 1990, people were feeling pretty confident. <BR>
There were only a very few states that were giving us problems as far as the very right to exist. <BR>
I'd say about 1990 it shifted.  Now the issue is how far can they regulate us, rather than do we<BR>
have the right to exist.  Then the DeJonge case this year probably put to rest the last really bitter<BR>
attack on home schooling in any state.  And we've had so many victories in the courts and<BR>
legislatures, it's phenomenal.  The fear has gone away and confidence has set in.<BR>

<P>What do you see as the major battles of the last ten years?<BR>
Klicka:  Discretionary approval was a major battle.  In many states the school districts had the<BR>
authority to determine any type of rules and regulations on home schoolers.<BR>

<P>Smith:  And we still have that battle in three or four states Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and<BR>
Utah.  South Carolina is technically an approval state, but there are some loopholes.<BR>

<P>Klicka:   Another major fight was over teacher qualifications.  We had to slug that out in Iowa,<BR>
North Dakota, and Michigan for years and years.  In Alabama, it still is an issue because the<BR>
state's position is that a parent has to be a certified tutor in order to home school. However, we<BR>
have figured a way around it through the church school exemption route.<BR>
I would say that we have the most problems each year in the private school states.  There is no<BR>
uniform home school law.  It continues to be a problem, but in a lesser degree, because we've<BR>
probably written to most every school district in California, Kansas, Indiana, Alabama, Texas, and<BR>
the seven other private school states.  Essentially we were creating policy in those states without<BR>
the legislature, just by our interpretation of the laws and winning some cases.  We've said the<BR>
same thing over and over and over until it just became the general way of interpreting the law.  In<BR>
Alabama the department of education says you can't home school unless you're a certified tutor,<BR>
but talk to any school district, and they'll say that you can if you do it under the church school<BR>
exemption.<BR>
Home visits, that was another big one.  We've reduced that to primarily Massachusetts and we're<BR>
still slugging it out in court there.<BR>

<P>Let's talk about cases: the worst, the best, the most inspiring.<BR>
Farris:  All of the cases in North Dakota were bad cases.  We were very frustrated trying to get<BR>
justice there.  Prosecutors were able to file briefs, arguing that the reason you need to have<BR>
certified teachers in the public schools was that kids need to have the experience of being beat up<BR>
by bullies on playgrounds.  It was so ridiculous in one case they argued that you have to have<BR>
certified teachers so you could get eye examinations in the public schools. The father was an eye<BR>
surgeon and the mother a nurse.  Certified teachers don't do eye examinations and if they do, they<BR>
don't do them nearly as well as a nurse or an eye surgeon. It was just nuts!<BR>

<P>Smith:  A case that hurt Chris was one we don't like to talk about because we lost.  You recall<BR>
that one, Chris, because we got jacked around on that one badly.  That was an injustice.  That was<BR>
the Schmidt case in Ohio.  <BR>

<P>Klicka:  That was one that started at the same time as DeJonge.  I'd put so much effort into that,<BR>
in the appeal process, getting it up to the Ohio Supreme Court.  The issue in Ohio was one of<BR>
approval whether the state had the right to approve or disapprove home schoolers.  We said<BR>
they didn't.  And all the facts were in our favor, the law was in our favor, but we had this<BR>
prosecutor who was very antagonistic.  She was very dilatory.<BR>

<P>Farris:  We had a brief-filing deadline that we were having a difficult time meeting.  So that we<BR>
wouldn't miss the deadline (this was in the early days of Federal Express), we put my secretary<BR>
Lois Ventsias on an airplane and flew her to Columbus, Ohio, from Washington National to file<BR>
the brief on time.  The prosecutor filed every brief in the appellate process 20-30 days late.  There<BR>
was a court rule in Ohio that if you didn't file the brief on time you didn't get to argue.  And that<BR>
if they had any legitimate plausibility to their case at all, the side filing on time would win over the<BR>
side that didn't file on time. But they totally ignored that.  <BR>

<P>Klicka:  Finally the ruling came down from the Ohio Supreme Court, which was the same court,<BR>
Mike, that ruled in the Whisner decision, which was a tremendous victory for Christians. So we<BR>
anticipated a victory, and they totally nailed us.  <BR>

<P>Farris:  The Christian community had rallied behind this judge who was professing to be a<BR>
Christian to elect him as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio, replacing a judge who<BR>
was philosophically alleged to be aligned with the ACLU.  And the Christian judge made the<BR>
ruling against us in Schmidt and so we really took a beating on that case both in terms of the<BR>
fairness of the procedure and the ultimate outcome.<BR>
 <BR>
Klicka:  It was devastating because the court wrote up a statement of facts that was totally<BR>
inaccurate.  It fit what the prosecutor had been essentially misleading the court on.  They didn't<BR>
look back and see what the real record was.  They ruled that they had to be approved, that  this<BR>
was a constitutional right and authority of the state.  This opened up the potential for untold<BR>
litigation in Ohio, because each school district did what was right in their own eyes and every<BR>
district had a different policy and interpretation.  We lost and I just couldn't believe it.  But God<BR>
worked it out.  We set the Schmidts up under the cover of a private school, so they could<BR>
continue home schooling.  Then shortly after that the regulations came down.  And that's the way<BR>
God always worked. If we didn't win the case, we won it through the legislature or regulations. <BR>
Or vice versa, sometimes a case was used to get the law passed.<BR>

<P>I would say the two best cases we've had were the Jeffery case in Pennsylvania, and the DeJonge<BR>
case from the Michigan Supreme Court.<BR>
Jeffery was tremendous because we had over thirty families being prosecuted for home schooling,<BR>
and 501 school districts that had different interpretations of the law.  It was endless work.  The<BR>
federal court just swept down after two years and said, &quot;this law is completely void for vagueness<BR>
and unconstitutional.&quot;  It was nice to go back to all of those 501 school districts and say, &quot;see<BR>
that's what we've been trying to tell you.  You didn't have to take these people to court, you<BR>
didn't have to harass them like you did.&quot;  That was a thrilling decision.<BR>

<P>And of course the DeJonge decision was even more significant, because it brought relief to a state<BR>
that had been one of the most heavily persecuted states over the last ten years.  It knocked out the<BR>
teacher certification requirement for both religious home schools and private schools.  In addition,<BR>
it ended up being one of the best religious freedom cases that has come down since probably<BR>
Yoder in 1972.  It accurately defined the original intent of the Constitution's framers.  The 38th<BR>
page of the opinion could have been written by James Madison himself!  And DeJonge was<BR>
especially rewarding because it took so long to get there 8 years. <BR>

<P>Farris:  That's a case that we longed for, prayed for, worked for, for such a long time.  It was the<BR>
most significant victory not just for HSLDA, but for home schoolers ever, anywhere, anytime,<BR>
anyplace.  <BR>

<P>But the Robin Diegel case in Ohio is the most inspiring case ever. The day before the trial I flew<BR>
out there and went to Mrs. Diegel's home. I went out in her backyard, and we sat at the picnic<BR>
table.  I was getting her prepared for trial and was talking to her about her religious beliefs.  It<BR>
was obvious to me that she really  didn't know the Lord even though she had a high respect for<BR>
the Word of God and was oriented toward Christian things.  So I walked her through the steps of<BR>
salvation, and she prayed to receive Christ that afternoon.<BR>

<P>The next day I walked into the trial.  The judge called us into his chambers and said, &quot;Mr. Farris, I<BR>
just read the Schmidt decision from the Supreme Court of Ohio.  You lost that case.  You're<BR>
going to lose this case, again today.&quot;  You know, I've been in courts where I thought the judge<BR>
had made up his mind before we started, but I never had one openly tell me.  <BR>
I went out, but I did not tell Robin what the judge said.  I had told her the night before that I<BR>
thought that God was going to do something really powerful in her case to welcome her to His<BR>
family, and to go home and read the Bible.  (I thought maybe she'd read the part in Deuteronomy<BR>
about stoning false prophets.)<BR>

<P>The prosecutor put his case on first.  He called the superintendent.  My turn to cross examine<BR>
came up, and I asked a question I've never asked before and I never have asked since.  It's a<BR>
dumb question.  It's objectionable really.  I asked, &quot;Did you get any legal advice before you<BR>
decided to turn this lady down in her right to home school?&quot;  The superintendent should have<BR>
said, &quot;no.&quot;  What could I have said?  Rather than do that he tried to justify himself.  He said,<BR>
&quot;Well, I didn't talk to any lawyers or anything like that but I talked to some government officials.&quot; <BR>
I said, &quot;Well, like who?&quot;  He said, &quot;Well, like the judge here.&quot;  I said, &quot;You talked to this judge<BR>
about this lady's case before this thing ever came to court?&quot;  He said, &quot;Yeah.&quot;  You should have<BR>
seen the judge's face.  There was a newspaper reporter in the courtroom.  <BR>

<P>The judge called recess, and he took us back into the chambers.  This time he was talking to the<BR>
prosecutor.  He said, &quot;You find a way to approve this lady.&quot;  We had some pow-wows in the hall,<BR>
and she got approved.  We went out and announced that in court.  The judge was very concerned<BR>
that the newspaper reporter be informed that this case had been approved and none of this<BR>
discussion business made it into the press.  It turns out the judge just made a good faith mistake. <BR>
He wasn't being a bad guy.  He was just a brand new judge and didn't know what the rules were. <BR>
It worked out.  The one question that was the chink in their armor jumped into my head out of the<BR>
blue.  That illustrates better than anything I know who is really the advocate here.  It's not us. <BR>
It's God.  That is the story of HSLDA that God is our advocate, and we're just the conduits.<BR>

<P>Back to <a href="#top">top</a> of the page.<BR>
<a name="cross"><BR>
                     <B>  At the Crossroads</B><BR>

<P>A glance at the decade behind us . . .<BR>
&quot;Home schooling?  Is it legal to do that?&quot;  The early days of the home education movement were<BR>
characterized by parents who possessed bold courage, a rugged pioneering spirit, and deep<BR>
commitment to providing the best education possible for their children, balanced with the realistic<BR>
apprehension that authorities might arrive at the door momentarily to challenge their educational<BR>
choice.<BR>

<P>With the founding of Home School Legal Defense Association ten years ago, constitutional<BR>
answers to the legal challenge found a primary voice of articulation.  Christopher J. Klicka,<BR>
HSLDA's longest standing full time employee, recalls, &quot;Families wanted to know if it was legal. <BR>
Many times I couldn't say it was, except from a constitutional perspective.&quot;<BR>

<P>A decade of experience has crystallized HSLDA's purpose through several vistas many<BR>
victorious, a few vicious, some discouraging, most invigorating.  &quot;There has been a clear shift<BR>
from the issues we were confronting in March of 1983,&quot; explains Michael P. Farris, HSLDA's<BR>
president and founder.  &quot;Back then, officials in most states would tell you that home schooling<BR>
was simply not legal.  But there has been a legislative and legal avalanche which has changed the<BR>
landscape forever.&quot; <BR>

<P>The most clear-cut victory of the past ten years is that the legality of home education is<BR>
recognized in every state of the union.  In fact, &quot;parental choice in education&quot; has become such a<BR>
prevalent theme in our society that U.S. Education Department official Michelle Easton in 1992<BR>
cited home schooling as &quot;the ultimate expression of parental choice&quot; in American families.<BR>

<P>No longer is the U.S. Constitution our sole means of defense for a parent's right to exercise the<BR>
viable alternative of home schooling.  From 1985 on, we saw a steady gain in the state legislatures<BR>
with three to four states each year changing their laws.<BR>

<P>In 1993, though some controversy remains in the eyes of a few states, no state statute actually<BR>
requires certification as a means of qualifying the home-educating parent.  A few &quot;brush fires&quot;<BR>
remain, like the problems created by Tennessee's and West Virginia's restriction of home<BR>
schooling to parents who have college degrees.<BR>

<P>A decade's track record on the legal landscape of the home education movement proves that God<BR>
has been our true advocate and protector.  By God's grace, the fear has gone away and a new<BR>
sense of confidence has set in.  Klicka comments, &quot;We know the states inside and out because we<BR>
were involved in the process of implementing so many of the changes in the laws.  We know<BR>
exactly what the new laws mean because we were involved in writing them.  We also know what<BR>
the precedents mean because we were involved in the case being won.&quot;<BR>

<P>A look into the decade ahead . . . <BR>

<P>It seems that after the &quot;age of enlightenment&quot; comes the &quot;age of regulation.&quot;  The freedom to<BR>
home educate rests upon two founda-tional principles:  the unencumbered right to practice one's<BR>
religious beliefs and the reinforcement of elements which strengthen the family unit and maintain<BR>
the structure and productivity of the home.  The foundations of these fundamental tenets in our<BR>
Constitution are beginning to come under serious and devastating attack.<BR>

<P>As society continues to move in the direction of increased government services for the family,<BR>
regulated with politically correct definitions of family relationships and social causes home<BR>
educators can expect more and more efforts to regulate our freedoms rather than the simple denial<BR>
of them altogether.  Home visits, written reports, day and hour requirements, curriculum reviews,<BR>
and more are the tools regulators may employ in this struggle to determine who is really in charge<BR>
of the children.<BR>

<P>The National Education Association (NEA) and many other groups serving the interests of public<BR>
education (such as the PTA) have openly declared their opposition to &quot;unqualified&quot; and &quot;unregu-lated&quot; parents teaching their children at home.  These are powerful political lobbying<BR>
organizations whose attitudes are clearly expressed in the words of Keith Geiger, NEA's<BR>
president, &quot;. . . quit talking about letting kids escape . . . &quot;<BR>

<P>Educationally, achievement testing is in essence the &quot;back door&quot; to curriculum control.  Testing<BR>
laws requiring home educators to demonstrate the validity of their teaching efforts through<BR>
standardized tests that do not match their curriculum objectives can become severely burdensome. <BR>
Adding the anticipated impact of Outcome-Based Education objectives on standardized testing to<BR>
this equation only compounds the threat.<BR>

<P>Furthermore, as government continues to consolidate social, educational, and healthcare reforms,<BR>
parents will experience the steady erosion of their jurisdiction to make decisions for their children. <BR>
Increasing skirmishes with child welfare agencies magnify this concern.<BR>

<P>Perhaps the most threatening specter on the horizon is the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the<BR>
Child, an international treaty which places the rights of the individual paramount to parental<BR>
concerns and judicious decisions in the child-rearing process.  Outcome-Based Education offers <BR>

<P>another all-encompassing forum for government agencies to decide how each young citizen must<BR>
think and act, along with the extensive (and intrusive) demands for who may be qualified for<BR>
college entrance or simple acceptance into the job market as an employee. <BR>

<P>The challenge of who is ultimately responsible for a child's well-being is nowhere more<BR>
pronounced than with special needs or handicapped children.  It has been HSLDA's experience<BR>
that home schooling is doubly wonderful for the special needs child.  Individualized attention is of<BR>
utmost benefit to the child with special challenges in life.  Parents occasionally coached by an<BR>
&quot;expert&quot; offer a far better alternative for many children than the route of institutionalization.  We<BR>
foresee many political and legal battles in this arena.<BR>

<P>Finally, the public outcry for &quot;some measure of accountability&quot; in response to a public education<BR>
system which is deeply flawed brings the danger that as government responds, monopolistic<BR>
control will be extended to every educational alternative.<BR>

<P>&quot;One thing we've learned for sure,&quot; says Chris Klicka, &quot;is that although we thought we could<BR>
work ourselves out of business in four or five years [when the legality of home schooling was<BR>
recognized everywhere], we'll never be able to do that until home education is no longer under<BR>
the domain of public school authorities.  As long as they are in authority over us, they will always<BR>
attempt to exceed their authority and look for ways to make it difficult, if not impossible for home<BR>
schoolers to operate.  They'll always try to intimidate us.&quot; <BR>

<P>In spite of regulatory threats, the future of the home education movement is bright!  The ranks of<BR>
home schoolers appear to be increasing by 15-20% annually, and the momentum is no where near<BR>
its peak!  State organizations many of whom are also celebrating their tenth anniversaries this<BR>
year or have already passed the decade milestone are becoming broader in their scope of<BR>
service.  In addition to providing a network of basic information and sponsoring conventions and<BR>
curriculum fairs, the state groups are organized to act legislatively, and several are beginning to<BR>
offer extensive educational services and extracurricular opportunities for older students.<BR>

<P>A flourishing home school curriculum market reveals the wealth of talent and creativity within the<BR>
movement.  New curricular packages and supplemental materials abound, expanding the<BR>
possibilities for targeting specific learning needs and enriching the overall learning environment.<BR>

<P>Technology promises another bright vista, and the possibilities of the &quot;on-line&quot; home school are<BR>
boundless.  Teaching aids, learning games, and the resources of an entire library can be just key-strokes away.  Colleges are even beginning to experiment with &quot;at home&quot; course work through<BR>
computer and video access.  Some are going so far as to offer undergraduate and graduate<BR>
degrees in addition to thought-provoking enrichment experiences.<BR>

<P>Another promising glow on the horizon is the positive perception that home schooling is gaining<BR>
in society.  Due in large measure to the obvious success of home education as evidenced in the<BR>
children, favorable media attention has also created a more accepting atmosphere.  In addition, the<BR>
ability to be creative and try new alternatives is also generating a popular swell of interest in home<BR>
schooling as society recognizes that the education establishment's methods of the last 30 years<BR>
have miserably failed.<BR>

<P>Most important of all, however, the time, energy, and loving sacrifice that we are investing in our<BR>
children is reaping rich rewards.  We are witnessing the beginning of a second generation of<BR>
home-schooling families as children who were taught at home marry and establish families of their<BR>
own.  Unencumbered by many of the educational &quot;traditions&quot; that bound their parents, the<BR>
potential for achievement for this next generation is unlimited.  We are only beginning to see the<BR>
tremendous impact that our children will have on the world, and we confidently believe that they<BR>
will be the leaders of tomorrow.  <BR>
Certainly the things in life most worth having are most worthy of our active defense.  Yes, there<BR>
will be battles, but the future is bright!<BR>

<B>                   Hard Times in North Dakota</B><BR>
HSLDA received the following letter in August 1988. It eloquently describes the fears and joys of<BR>
a home-schooling family living in North Dakota in the early 1980s.<BR>

<P>Part of my preparation for moving from San Marcos, Texas, to North Dakota, was to try and get<BR>
in touch with some home-schooling families in the Minot area. That was my first inkling of what<BR>
the situation would be like in North Dakota. I wrote to several families whose names I had<BR>
obtained from Hewitt-Moore. Without exception, ALL had either given up home schooling or<BR>
had moved to a different state. But we had no choice; the United States Air Force had given us<BR>
irrevocable orders to Minot Air Force Base.<BR>

<P>One of my letters resulted in a telephone call from the Paden family who had moved to South<BR>
Dakota where home schooling was legal. They told me who the few individuals were who had<BR>
been supportive of them in the church in Minot, but did not reveal the names of those who had<BR>
opposed them except to say that it was the church school teacher and her husband who had<BR>
turned them in to the authorities.<BR>

<P>So, in August 1983, the first week that we attended church in Minot, I almost felt as if I should be<BR>
wearing an overcoat and dark glasses! Somewhat to my alarm, a woman named Iris Severtson, a<BR>
friend of the Padens, approached us immediately and asked us over for dinner. But Mrs.<BR>
Severtson, though a public elementary school teacher, was indeed supportive of home schooling,<BR>
for she had a daughter who was doing it in another state. But we had already decided to NEVER<BR>
tell anyone else that we were home schooling.<BR>

<P>Our son Scott was below compulsory attendance age that first year. Still, people seemed to<BR>
assume that my 6 1/2-year-old son was (or should be) in first grade. So whenever anyone at<BR>
church asked, &quot;Does Scott go to school on base?&quot; I nodded affirmatively. Our home school was<BR>
definitely on the base where we lived. On base, we simply &quot;hid&quot; from our neighbors, which wasn't<BR>
too difficult to do through the North Dakota winter.<BR>

<P>I had decided that if we should get caught the following year, I would insist that Scott be allowed<BR>
to attend the elementary school downtown and be placed into Mrs. Severtson's second grade<BR>
class. But by the end of that next summer, it was evident he was nowhere ready for second grade.<BR>
He was nearly eight, but had not learned to read with our curriculum's &quot;look-say&quot; method of<BR>
teaching reading, and was still quite emotionally immature. It was then that God brought phonics<BR>
into my life, and eventually voila! decoding began to make sense to him.<BR>

<P>Thus, during the school year of 1984-85, we virtually started over with reading. I felt more<BR>
strongly than ever that it was absolutely imperative for Scott to continue being taught at home<BR>
because of what might be considered academic &quot;irregularities.&quot; <BR>

<P>At first, we were nearly too paranoid to have any contact with other North Dakota home<BR>
schoolers. But eventually we met Gerald and Sheryl Lund and others who were being prosecuted.<BR>
I attended the 1985 legislative committee hearing in Bismarck and heard the eloquent testimonies,<BR>
and I watched the proposed home-schooling bill go down in solid defeat. <BR>

<P>I soon found out about the school census that was taken every other year in North Dakota. It was<BR>
through that census of 1983 that the Lund family was &quot;caught&quot; and marked for prosecution. So<BR>
when I read the announcement of the May 1985 census in the base newspaper, I totally panicked<BR>
to the point of being physically ill, and was even led to fast with my praying.<BR>

<P>After the Lunds and the others were given guilty verdicts and began the long process of appeals, it<BR>
seemed that more and more North Dakota home schoolers came out of the woodwork, risking<BR>
and facing prosecution, court trials and guilty verdicts. It was exciting to see that persecution did<BR>
not stamp out home schooling, but watered the very seeds for its growth. Near the end, our<BR>
paranoia about not wanting people to know we even knew home schoolers had changed to a deep<BR>
friendship with Sheryl and Gerald and assisting them in their battle against the illegal tactics of the<BR>
prosecutors.<BR>

<P>But we knew we never could be as brave and open as they were. Randy was not many years away from retirement, and we just couldn't risk his entire career with a civil court prosecution. (Several years before, Randy and I had known a military family in California who had merely wanted to keep their barely six-year-old son out of school an extra year. They were nearly court-martialed over it!) During the next two years, Randy tried very hard to get orders to another base in a different state and was even willing to accept overseas orders, since we had learned that military members overseas were able to home school legally. Finally, shortly after the beginning of the1986-87 school year, Randy got an assignment to Europe to take place the following summer, so we began to relax, yet never really released our vigilant determination to never tell anyone our secret. <BR>

<P>Even though I had a pianist job at the base chapel for our last two years there, and had also<BR>
become fairly friendly with some of my own church members, I never talked about my kids'<BR>
school life. I found that people inevitably were much more willing to talk about their own kids and<BR>
their own lives, so I always directed the conversation to them, rather than us. And it seemed to<BR>
work.<BR>

<P>Of course, as my children grew older, they became more socially outgoing. Naturally, other kids<BR>
would ask, &quot;Who's your teacher?&quot; or &quot;What room are you in?&quot; or &quot;Which school do you go to?&quot;<BR>
To the kids on the base, they said, &quot;We go to a private school,&quot; and that seemed to<BR>
suffice except for the one church family who lived on base. The two youngest were Scott's and<BR>
Lisa's ages and became best friends with them. I even became good friends with their mother a<BR>
social worker who confronted me directly only once. I couldn't lie. I just told her I couldn't talk<BR>
about it and that I would tell her &quot;someday.&quot;<BR>

<P>Then a friendly neighbor let us know that they knew of our home schooling. She was neutral and<BR>
casual, but did say that all the neighbors knew.<BR>

<P>While Randy had had the assignment to Europe for several months, he did not get the official<BR>
orders until just days before we had to face the ordeal of another school census (May 1987).<BR>
However, God had plans for us that we didn't know about. Randy's orders to Europe were<BR>
canceled in July, and it seemed as if our whole world had crumpled. Then God gave us an<BR>
assignment in Texas instead a state that had had home-schooling trouble brewing for several<BR>
years, but had just won a major court victory for home schoolers in April of 1986 praise the<BR>
Lord! <BR>

<P>God taught us some major lessons in patience and trust during the months between the canceled<BR>
orders and the new orders to Texas. Because we had not moved to Europe during the summer, as<BR>
anticipated, a new school year (1987-88) was well under way, bringing its usual rash of<BR>
prosecutions of home schoolers and &quot;unapproved&quot; Christian schools throughout the state. So our<BR>
actual physical move felt something like deliverance from Egypt and entering into the borders of<BR>
Canaan. <BR>

<P>As with the Israelites' wandering in the wilderness, the entire North Dakota home-schooling<BR>
experience had a direct effect on our spiritual life, as a family, and as individual persons. God gave<BR>
me an increased understanding of my children's own unique needs. His answers to prayer were<BR>
very practical and at just the right time. And through visits to other states, He gave us optimism<BR>
and confidence that my children were progressing quite &quot;normally,&quot; while still confirming the<BR>
wisdom of our decision to home school.<BR>

<P>God rewarded my tearful struggles with the joys of watching my son reach his &quot;Integrated<BR>
Maturity Level,&quot; a point when suddenly everything seems to fit together. For Scott it happened<BR>
near the end of the third year when, at age 9 1/2, he decided he wanted to read on his own. By the<BR>
end of the next school year, he scored three grade levels above his grade level in reading! <BR>

<P>Throughout, God taught me to overcome fear (II Timothy 1:7), but not to abandon caution<BR>
(Proverbs 22:3). But it was only after we were safely in Texas (January 1988) that God revealed<BR>
to us what else He had done for us in North Dakota a situation which He in His mercy had<BR>
totally hidden from us at the time.<BR>

<P>In spite of what I initially had told people about Scott &quot;going to school on base,&quot; one of the<BR>
church members told another inquiring church member that &quot;Scott doesn't go to any school, as<BR>
far as I know.&quot; Then one of the &quot;good brethren&quot; of the church apparently felt it was their God-given duty to report to the authorities that the McDonalds were not sending their child to school.<BR>
And this all happened that first year before Scott had even reached the minimum compulsory<BR>
attendance age!<BR>

<P>So, that very first school year, a public school attendance officer called the church school to<BR>
inquire about Scott. God saw to it that the phone was not answered by the church school teacher<BR>
(whom I was sure would have turned us in), but by an individual who &quot;just happened&quot; to be at the<BR>
church and answered the school phone when the teacher and students were out on the playground<BR>
for recess! This happened, not only once, but also during our second school year that crucial<BR>
year of teaching Scott phonics.<BR>

<P>When asked, &quot;Do you know of a Scott McDonald?,&quot; this person said, &quot;Oh, yes, he's such an asset<BR>
to any school. You're not trying to 'steal' him, are you?&quot; When they didn't seem quite satisfied,<BR>
the respondent continued, describing him as &quot;bright, intelligent, and well-behaved.&quot; And, in<BR>
answer to prayer, the public school official never once asked directly, &quot;Is Scott McDonald<BR>
enrolled in your church school?&quot; <BR>

<P>Every day in North Dakota, we prayed for God to protect our home school, to send angels to<BR>
surround our apartment. Now I know truly just how, as with Daniel, my God sent His angel to<BR>
&quot;shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me.&quot; To this day I have not stopped praising God<BR>
for this miracle!<BR>
                                            Jacqueline McDonald<BR>

<P>Today, the McDonalds are living in Fort Worth, Texas.  Randy is now retired from the Air<BR>
Force.  Scott, 17 and a junior in high school, is experiencing his first year of &quot;traditional&quot;<BR>
education at a Christian boarding school.  Jacqueline reports that he is excelling academically<BR>
and socially.  Lisa is in the ninth grade of the McDonald family's home school. <BR>

<P>             <B>    Home Schooling Spells Success</B><BR>
by Michael Farris<BR>

<P><B>H</B>ome School Legal Defense Association's tenth anniversary gives me a unique opportunity to<BR>
reflect on the many blessings and challenges of a full decade. It also gives me a chance to look<BR>
ahead with vision for this organization specifically, and the movement in general.<BR>

<P><B>O</B>ur family has experienced our own version of growth over the past ten years. In 1983 we had<BR>
three children two of school age. We were finishing our first year of home schooling when I was<BR>
prompted to start HSLDA. We now have nine children and have graduated our oldest two<BR>
children.<BR>

<P><B>M</B>y motivation to start Home School Legal Defense Association came from a three-fold analysis:<BR>
(1) the home-schooling movement had a great potential for growth; (2) the education<BR>
establishment would vigorously fight this movement; (3) and traditional fund-raising methods<BR>
would not provide the solid basis needed for long-range effective defense of home schooling.<BR>
Home schooling is a different approach to education, and I wanted a different approach to<BR>
building a legal defense organization.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>ach of these points has been validated over the years. Home schooling is growing by leaps and<BR>
bounds as parents are increasingly looking for alternatives that promote good academics, common<BR>
sense morality, and family unity. Home-schooled children are the great advertisement for each of<BR>
these qualities.<BR>

<P><B>S</B>chool officials have lived up to my original expectations. Some have been fierce opponents of<BR>
home education. Some have been more or less neutral (&quot;just doing my job&quot;). Others have been<BR>
friendly and hospitable.<BR>

<P><B>C</B>hallenges tend to be remembered more than friendly interactions because of the nature of our<BR>
business. But for every nasty, difficult situation, we have six or seven that are resolved amicably.<BR>
We are constantly amazed at our successes in peaceful negotiations. This is the principal reason<BR>
(from a human perspective) that we have been able to maintain the cost of HSLDA membership at<BR>
$100.00 without a price increase in over eight years.<BR>

<P><B>H</B>owever, thousands of families have faced situations which are far from pleasant. Hundreds have<BR>
ended up in court or administrative hearings.<BR>

<P><B>O</B>ur battlegrounds have shifted around the nation. We have faced fierce or multiple legal conflicts<BR>
in South Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Michigan, Virginia, Iowa, Tennessee, New York,<BR>
Rhode Island, and, of course, North Dakota, just to name a few. One year it's one state that is<BR>
&quot;the worst.&quot; Another year it is some place else.<BR>

<P><B>O</B>ur success rate in defense can be attributed only to the grace of God. No HSLDA member<BR>
family has ever been forced to stop home schooling by a final court order (a few have given up<BR>
after initial losses). No child has ever been taken from their parents. No parent has ever been<BR>
sentenced to jail. We have had a few families pay fines, but then just keep on home schooling. Our<BR>
sweetest victories were the declaration of Pennsylvania and Michigan's laws to be<BR>
unconstitutional. Michigan was especially pleasing.<BR>

<P><B>L</B>egislative successes have been even more important. While HSLDA has played a supportive role<BR>
in this process, the real heroes of legislative victories are the state organizations which battle so<BR>
effectively for the rights of home schoolers in each state capital.<BR>

<P><B>L</B>egislative battles have been fought on Capitol Hill as well. And we anticipate more of these in<BR>
the future.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>ach time we speak up for home schoolers on Capitol Hill, we build a little more long-range<BR>
credibility. We have been especially effective in building good relationships on Capitol Hill by our<BR>
leadership on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.<BR>

<P><B>G</B>iven the aggressiveness of the child's rights advocates, we can expect more intense battles in the<BR>
days ahead.<BR>

<P><B>A</B>ll of our activities: court cases, legislative battles, publications, and our radio program are made<BR>
possible (again, humanly speaking) by our faithful member families. We are very, very grateful for<BR>
the 37,500 families who are current members as well as those who have ever been members of<BR>
HSLDA.<BR>

<P><B>L</B>et me also give credit to all our great staff. J. Michael Smith was the first person I approached<BR>
with the idea of HSLDA and he co-founded the organization with me. Christopher Klicka has<BR>
been with us longer than anyone else and is our top expert on home school statutes. Dewitt Black,<BR>
Jordan Lorence, and Scott Somerville are stalwarts for our members. All our attorneys are home-schooling dads.<BR>

<P><B>D</B>ouglas Phillips and Inge Cannon in the National Center for Home Education also have visibility<BR>
in the home-schooling community for their great service. Inge is our primary liaison to state<BR>
organizations. Doug is our man on Capitol Hill.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>ach of the other members of our staff do a great work on your behalf although they do not get<BR>
as much opportunity for public recognition. Our legal assistants are Pat Ramirez, Sally Cowan,<BR>
Kimberly Wray, Wanda Hebert, and Angela Yerovsek. The membership department is directed by Charles Hurst, and includes Aaron Fessler, Janet Wayne, Linda Meloy, Cora Prather, Cynthia Clapp, Katherine Polansky, Katey Ritchie, Barbara Hindman, David Gilstrap, Dennise Bly, Shari<BR>
Donaldson, and Polly Gicker. Angel Fessler completes the National Center team, and the<BR>
communications department consists of Suzanne Stephens, Darby Waters, and Jayme Farris. We<BR>
are especially proud of the home school graduates on our staff: Aaron and Angel Fessler, Dennise<BR>
Bly, Jayme Farris, and Polly Gicker.<BR>

<P><B>F</B>reedom is a fragile commodity. It must be won. It must be maintained. Freedom is not a<BR>
guarantee. It is something we earn.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>arning freedom starts with doing a good job training our children academically, socially,<BR>
spiritually, and morally. Home-schooling freedom will continue to advance so long as we continue<BR>
to pursue excellence in all that we do.<BR>

<P><B>N</B>o sacrifice is too great for the inestimable reward of children who grow up able, equipped, and<BR>
spiritually mature. Our kids are worth it. Our children receive the most precious commodity our<BR>
society has to offer our time.<BR>

<P><B>S</B>econd generation home-schooling is beginning to become more of a reality. As our children<BR>
grow up and marry others committed to home education, and as they are blessed with children,<BR>
we finally see the real fruit for which we strive. My goal is to produce children committed to<BR>
godliness, excellence, and a generational commitment to home education.<BR>

<P><B>E</B>ducation reform is a major political issue in our nation. Building up the family is another matter<BR>
of grave importance to our nation. Drug prevention, avoidance of premarital sex, and prevention<BR>
of crime all occupy the political spotlight. We may not have total solutions to all these ills, but<BR>
home education offers one sure fire method of making a positive contribution on each of these<BR>
fronts. Home education offers us an opportunity to be good parents, good citizens, and good<BR>
servants of our God. Let's excel at each task and build a legacy for the future. <BR>

              <B> Highlighting Milestones: 1983-1993</B><BR>

<P>Non-HSLDA cases are marked with an asterisk (*).<BR>

<P>1983 This year, home school statutes or regulations were adopted in Wisconsin and<BR>
Montana.<BR>

<P>March 26   Washington: Michael Farris and J. Michael Smith founded the Home School Legal<BR>
Defense Association.<BR>

<P>April 26   Wisconsin: Monumental changes were made in the Wisconsin law relating to home<BR>
education.  The state court of appeals declared the state's compulsory attendance law uncon-stitutional in Wisconsin v. Popanz.*<BR>

<P>May 18   Washington: Because they were being denied the right to educate their children, home<BR>
schoolers, led by HSLDA, challenged the constitutionality of the Washington statute when they<BR>
filed the Caproni case.  This contributed to the passage of a new home school law in 1985.   <BR>

<P>
<P>1984 This year, home school statutes or regulations were adopted in Georgia, Louisiana,<BR>
Rhode Island, and Virginia.<BR>

<P>February 23   Nebraska: Exactly three months after they had been jailed for having their children<BR>
enrolled in a Christian school, six courageous Christian men walked out of jail free.  Michael<BR>
Farris handled this case for Concerned Women for America.*<BR>

<P>August 16   Nebraska: The State Department of Education announced that parents with a<BR>
sincerely-held religious conviction against state educational standards can privately educate their<BR>
children as long as the children are taught equivalent branches of learning and are submitted to<BR>
periodic state testing.<BR>

<P>November 15   Louisiana: The State Board of Education adopted &quot;Home Study Guidelines.&quot;<BR>
The legislation stipulated that for the 1984-85 school year, all applications for home schooling<BR>
will be automatically accepted.  In 1985-86, however, home school parents must meet one of<BR>
three requirements.<BR>

<P>December 19   Indiana: The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled in<BR>
favor of the Mazanec family and upheld the right of home schools to operate as private schools<BR>
saying, &quot;it is now doubtful that the requirements of a formally licensed or certified teacher . . .<BR>
would pass constitutional muster.&quot;*<BR>

<P>
<P>1985 This year, home school statutes or regulations were adopted in Arkansas, Florida,<BR>
New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington, and Wyoming.<BR>

<P>January   Kansas:  A Kansas state court dismissed all charges against Kim and Constance Jost,<BR>
who had been criminally charged with truancy for operating their home school as a private school. <BR>
The court ruled that the law was somewhat vague, but that the Josts had a legitimate school.<BR>

<P>February 18   Texas: Three of the five families from Katy, Texas, were found guilty of violating<BR>
the compulsory attendance law.  Several days later, the fourth family was found guilty.  However,<BR>
all these cases were put on hold due to the pending Leeper case, and the fifth family was<BR>
victorious in May.<BR>

<P>March 12   Texas: Leeper, et al v. Texas Education Agency, et al was filed, suing the Texas<BR>
Education Agency (TEA) and the state's 1,060 school districts in response to the continued<BR>
violation of home schoolers' civil rights.  Fort Worth attorney Shelby Sharpe handled the case. <BR>
HSLDA joined as a plaintiff.*<BR>

<P>April 23   Michigan:  Warrants for the arrests of Mark and Chris DeJonge, charged with<BR>
criminal truancy for home schooling without a certified teacher, were issued.  Attorney David<BR>
Kallman was retained to assist with their case.<BR>

<P>May 7   North Carolina: In Delconte v. North Carolina, the North Carolina Supreme Court<BR>
unanimously ended prosecution of home schoolers by holding that home schools qualify as private<BR>
schools under the law and thus fulfill the compulsory attendance law.*<BR>

<P>February 20   North Dakota:  In the Larsen case, the State Supreme Court ruled against the<BR>
Patzer, Larsen, Reimche, and Lund families, who had been charged with violating the state's<BR>
compulsory attendance law.*<BR>

<P>March 10   California: In People v. Darrah and Black, et al, the municipal court ruled that<BR>
because 48222 fails to provide fair notice or establish guidelines as to what constitutes a &quot;person<BR>
capable of teaching&quot; and what constitutes a &quot;private full-time day school,&quot; it is unconstitutionally<BR>
vague and unenforceable.<BR>

<P>June 17   Michigan: The court ruled in Haines, Smolls, Gibson v. Runkle that home schoolers<BR>
do not need to seek approval and that the state must exhaust their administrative remedies before<BR>
bringing criminal charges against families for home schooling.  David Kallman represented the<BR>
HSLDA families involved.<BR>

<P>October 22   Iowa: The Iowa Supreme Court agreed to hear HSLDA's appeal in Iowa v.<BR>
Trucke.  The Trucke family was charged with violating the state's compulsory attendance law<BR>
because they were not using a certified teacher for at least 120 days of the school year.<BR>

right to home school was finally recognized by the lower <BR>
magistrate.    <BR>

<P>
<P>1987 This year, home school statutes or regulations were adopted in Maryland,<BR>
Minnesota, Vermont, and West Virginia.<BR>

<P>February 4   South Carolina:  South Carolina home schoolers and HSLDA were able to<BR>

would have required all home schoolers to have a bachelor's degree. <BR>
 <BR>
February 16   Maryland:  Maryland home schoolers convinced the Maryland Legislature to<BR>
remove the home visit requirement from the Department of Education's regulations.<BR>

<P>March 5   Maine:  The Maine Commissioner of Education reversed a local school board's denial<BR>
for the Dionne family, thereby allowing them to home school.  The family earlier had a truant<BR>
officer enter the home insisting on taking the children to public school until HSLDA warned him<BR>
they would bring  kidnapping charges.  <BR>

<P>March 17   Nebraska:  Nebraska home schoolers defeated L.B. 682, which would have repealed<BR>
the religious exemption provision and restored the teacher certification <BR>
requirement.    <BR>
 <BR>
March 25   Ohio:  The Ohio Supreme Court upheld the conviction of the Schmidt family in Ohio<BR>
v. Schmidt.  The Court relied on the prosecutor's version of the facts, which asserted that the<BR>
family did not exhaust their administrative remedies. The facts presented at trial, however, showed<BR>
that the Schmidts had met with the superintendent several times.  Since the record of the trial was<BR>
destroyed by the Court of Common Pleas' defective recording equipment, the Court could not<BR>
compare the prosecutor's version with the actual record.  <BR>

<P>March 26   North Dakota: Gerald and Sheryl Lund and Richard and Kathy Reimche were put on<BR>
trial again for the crime of home schooling their children.  Both were again declared guilty. <BR>
HSLDA appealed their case to the North Dakota Supreme Court.<BR>

<P>April 13   Texas:  Leeper, et al v. Arlington Independent School District, et al, round one   <BR>

to operate freely.  This case resulted in the dismissal of approximately 20 criminal prosecutions of<BR>
HSLDA families throughout Texas.<BR>

<P>April   Washington, DC:  A three-tier policy for predicting attrition and determining enlistment<BR>

Hinsdale County School Board v. Main.  The court granted the family a religious exemption from<BR>
the approval requirement based on their First Amendment rights.<BR>

<P>June 27   Massachusetts:  The federal court found that in the case of New Life Baptist Church<BR>
Academy v. East Longmeadow School District that the district's approval process was not the<BR>
least restrictive means for ensuring the state's interest in the children's <BR>
education.*<BR>

<P>August 7   Ohio:  As a result of a dramatic turn of events in the middle of trial, in which the<BR>
superintendent testified that he had conferred with the trial judge prior to filing the complaint for<BR>
truancy, the judge ruled that Robin Diegel had not been given an opportunity for a hearing before<BR>
the superintendent, and granted HSLDA's motion for dismissal.<BR>
August 7   Rhode Island:  In Kinstead v. East Greenwich School Committee, home visits were<BR>
declared unconstitutional and removed as a requirement for approval. <BR>

<P>August 19   Iowa:  The State Supreme Court remanded Iowa v. Trucke to the district court for<BR>
dismissal, because charges against the family had been filed prematurely.  The statute requires<BR>
parents to send their children to school 120 days each year.  The Truckes were charged with<BR>
truancy 30 days into the school year, when no parent could possibly have been in compliance with<BR>
the law.<BR>

<P>September 3   North Dakota:  In North Dakota v. Melin, the judge ruled that the teacher<BR>
certification requirement was unduly burdening the Melins' religious freedom, was not necessarily<BR>
fulfilling the state's interest, and was not the least restrictive means available to the state to<BR>
preserve its interest.  Although this decision was later reversed by the State Supreme Court, it<BR>
was a surprising victory in a hostile state.<BR>
September 29   Pennsylvania:  The 11 school district superintendents in Jeffery, et al v.<BR>
O'Donnell, et al entered a motion requesting the appointment of guardians for the home-schooled<BR>
children in the case.  Federal Judge Kosik denied the motion and protected the parents' rights.<BR>

<P>1988 This year, home school statutes or regulations were adopted in Colorado, New York,<BR>
South Carolina, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.<BR>

were operating as a &quot;satellite&quot; of a local private school board.<BR>

<P>April 27   New York:  In an educational neglect case against the Blackwelder family, one of the<BR>
families involved in HSLDA's federal civil rights action, the judge ruled in favor of the family and<BR>
dismissed the case, saying that there were no grounds for an educational neglect verdict.<BR>

<P>May 2   Michigan:  The circuit court's ruling in Sheridan Road Baptist Church v. State,<BR>
provided the legal alternative for non-public schools (and home schools)  to use the third party<BR>
reporting procedure and thereby avoid the teacher certification requirement.*<BR>

<P>May 10   Colorado:  A new home school bill, S.B. 56, was signed into law by the governor. <BR>
The new law repealed the former arbitrary approval process.<BR>

<P>May 31   North Dakota:  In State v. Lund/Reimche, the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled in<BR>
favor of the families and reversed their truancy convictions, since the prosecutor could not prove<BR>
the age of the children.<BR>

<P>June 17   New York:  The Board of Regents passed new home school regulations which set<BR>
forth a clearly defined process for notification.<BR>

<P>June 17   New York:  In the federal case Blackwelder v. Safnauer, District Court Judge Munson <BR>
ruled  that the old law was constitutional. However, because the new regulations were passed on<BR>
the same day, the negative ruling had no adverse affect on the families. <BR>

<P>June 28   North Dakota: <BR>
State v. Anderson<BR>

<P>July 19   North Dakota: <BR>
State v. Dagley  <BR>

<P>In both cases the North Dakota Supreme Court ruled against the families, and the teacher certific-ation requirement remained intact.<BR>

approval requirements, were adopted by the Hawaii Department of Education.<BR>

<P>August 24   Pennsylvania: U.S. District Court Judge Edwin M. Kosik ruled in Jeffery, et al v.<BR>
O'Donnell, et al that &quot;the tutorial provision of Pennsylvania Compulsory Attendance Law . . . is<BR>
unconstitutionally vague&quot; and therefore, unenforceable.  As a result of this victory, over twenty<BR>
cases in court against HSLDA families were won or dismissed.<BR>

held, as a part of The Teaching Home's National Home School Convention.<BR>

<P>December 1   Colorado:  The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's ruling in People In<BR>
Interest of D.B. that children enrolled in an independent or parochial school can be allowed by the<BR>
school to be taught at home.  HSLDA wrote an amicus brief in this case supporting attorney Bill<BR>
Moritz.*<BR>

tea bags with the attached message: &quot;The consent of the governed for home schooling, too!&quot;<BR>

<P>February 27   North Dakota:  Judge Dennis A. Schneider dismissed the child neglect charge of<BR>
HSLDA members Barry and Kim Fischer, and in a five-page decision ruled that simply proving<BR>
that a child is not receiving an education as required by law is not sufficient to sustain such<BR>
charges.<BR>

<P>April 7   North Dakota:  Governor George A. Sinner signed into law H.B. 1421, North<BR>
Dakota's new home-schooling law, which repeals the state's former teacher certification<BR>
requirement for all teachers.<BR>

<P>May 24   South Carolina:  Michael Farris filed Lawrence v. State Board of Education in state<BR>
court to suspend the Educational Entrance Exam (EEE) requirement for home school parents. <BR>
HSLDA contends that the examination was improperly validated and the requirement is an<BR>
unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of parents to direct the education of their children.  <BR>

<P>August 9   Michigan:  The Court of Appeals rendered its decision against the DeJonge family. <BR>
HSLDA appealed the case to the Michigan Supreme Court. <BR>

school law, which is favorable to home education.<BR>

Jones, Deputy for Military Manpower and Personnel Policy, and Dr. W.S. Sellman, Director of<BR>

to their arbitrary assignment to Tier II status.  This was the first of many meetings and several<BR>
years of correspondence regarding this issue. <BR>

<P>June 22   Alabama:  HSLDA succeeded in getting a case dismissed against a home school family<BR>
in Fort Payne City v. Johnson, when HSLDA proved that the family was about 1,000 feet outside<BR>
the school district's jurisdiction.  <BR>

<P>July 2   Rhode Island:  In three separate decisions, the Commissioner of Education ruled that the<BR>
school district's demand that students participate in the school's testing program violated the<BR>

Group Leaders' Symposium was held in Syracuse.<BR>

<P>September 4   Massachusetts:  The District Court of Amesbury Division ruled in favor of a<BR>

<P>September 6   Pennsylvania:  HSLDA's civil rights suit, Stobaugh v. Wallace, was heard. <BR>
Pittsburgh Superintendent Richard Wallace had issued orders requiring home-schooling families<BR>
to participate in the district's own testing program, and when they refused, retaliated by issuing a<BR>
portfolio demand.  The judge dismissed the suit for prematurity, but blasted Superintendent<BR>
Wallace for choosing to &quot;arbitrarily flout state law.&quot;  The heart of the ruling was a clear home-schooling victory.<BR>

truancy charges against Mrs. Deely. <BR>

<P>April 19   Virginia:  The Supreme Court of Virginia in Johnson v. Prince William County ruled<BR>
unanimously in favor of a home school family on the legal issues, thereby setting precedent across<BR>

Johnson's religious beliefs.  HSLDA immediately filed for a new religious exemption for the<BR>
family, which was subsequently granted.<BR>

<P>May 3   Iowa:  The Iowa Legislature passed House File 455 into law, allowing parents to home<BR>

Report&quot; and that the compulsory attendance law is vague and basically unenforceable. This same<BR>
year, a total of twelve other Michigan familes were criminally prosecuted for not having teaching<BR>

that law in Michigan was vague.<BR>

exemption or the home-based education exemption.  However, the court also required all home<BR>
schools applying to be private schools to comply with all fire, health, and safety regulations<BR>
pertaining to private schools.  HSLDA filed a motion with the trial court to clarify this opinion<BR>
and to attempt to reverse this reading of the private school law.  <BR>

<P>August 28   Alabama:  HSLDA member Helene Richards, a mother of four children, had been<BR>

<P>    <B>  Remember today</B> that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the<BR>
discipline of the Lord your God: his majesty, his mighty hand, his outstretched arm; the signs he<BR>
performed and the things he did . . . <BR>
      Observe therefore, all the commands I am giving you today, so that you may have the<BR>
strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess, and so that<BR>
you may live long in the land that the Lord swore to your forefathers to give them and their<BR>
descendants . . . <BR>
      Fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds; tie them as symbols on your hands and<BR>
bind them on your foreheads.  Teach them to your children, talking about them when you sit at<BR>
home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up.  Write them<BR>
on the door frames of your houses and on your gates, so that your days and the days of your<BR>
children may be many in the land that the Lord swore to give your forefathers, as many as the<BR>
days that the heavens are above the earth.&quot;<BR>
