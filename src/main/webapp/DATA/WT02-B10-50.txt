<P>The development of societally benign and desirable fuels and vehicle technologies involves changes within industry, infrastructure, consumers, and market, but can usually not be propelled by market forces alone. In relation to gasoline cars, as being the 'main-stream' car propulsion technology, the alternatives are inherently hampered by not having the same long history of technical development, established market, and support by vested interests. Therefor, managing an early market of electric and hybrid electric cars involve both private and public interests in order to decrease some of the uncertainty that follows any new technology.</P>





<P>One must however also be aware of the strength of the technological 'paradigm' to strike back when threatened. Rapid developments of sail-boats and of gas-lightning occurred when faced with competition from steam-boats and electric-lightning, respectively. By the same token, gasoline car
technology will probably be much further developed in areas of emissions and energy consumption when confronted by a competing alternative that perform well in those areas, as the electric car do.
</P>




<!-- Graphic Tag --><IMG WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=130 ALIGN=left SRC="ehvpic/vespa.gif"><P>As a secondary effect, the development of alternative fuels and vehicles is often perceived as to increase the market push for cleaner conventional vehicles. In a short term perspective, this is the most obvious result of the evolving presence of alternative fuels on the automotive industry agenda. </P>





<P>The question, whether or not gasoline cars will stay on top for another century, or if electric propulsion will rapidly or slowly take over, still resides within the future. What we do know, however, is that electric cars today gather more support by industry and government than ever before and
that electric cars have been developed that gives sports car performance and more than 400 km range from one charge.</P>





<P>This means that the technological development of electric cars in recent years have taken a big step forward, with a consequent shift in focus from vehicle related issues to issues of early market and infrastructure - a shift that in itself is an indication of the promise of electric propulsion.</P>







<P>According to researchers studying technical changes in society, bigger changes in market demand must follow the &#148;closing in&#148; of technology, that is when vehicle manufacturers and customers agree on general product specifications. For newer types of propulsion technologies and fuels like electric vehicles, this closing of technology is not carried through. To do this, an iteration of evaluation reports and vehicle upgrading must occur in established partnerships.</P>

<P>The Swedish car market represents a very small portion of world sales. It is decentralised and is constituted of relatively wealthy but demanding customers. The climate is varied fom north to south and changes with the season. This makes Sweden a tough market, suitable as a test site for new vehicle technology
</P>




<P>So far, most of the passenger vehicles in the projects supported by KFB were made by the French manufacturer Renault. It is probable that backing from at least one large auto manufacturer is indispensable to sustain vehicle deliveries and service levels while running a growing number of new-tech as well as high-tech vehicles under commercial cinditions. On the other hand, studying market response to developimg competiton is vital. Hence, it is the intention of the program to broaden competition.
</P>



<P>To fulfil individual transportation needs there are other ways than just owning a car , paying mortgages, insurance and repairs. Simply renting a car, subscribing to different kinds of public service car-sharing or sharing a fleet of cars with a few friends or neighbours, may all be ways to cope with rising operating costs. In France, for example, several research projects aim to develop ways to offer attractive vehicles with high availability to the city public.
