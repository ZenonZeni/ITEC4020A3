<B> (WASHINGTON)</b></FONT><font size=3><b> -- The National Defense Stockpile Market Impact Committee (the Committee),
co-chaired by the Departments of Commerce and State, today published a Federal Register Notice (61 FR 51403, October 2, 1996) seeking public comment on the market impact of the Department of Defense's (DOD) proposed sale of excess materials from the National Defense Stockpile.<P>

The Committee provides advice to DOD on the projected domestic and foreign economic effects of all acquisitions and disposals of materials from the Stockpile that are to be included in an Annual Materials Plan (AMP).  The AMP must be approved by Congress.  The Committee is now considering DOD's proposed FY 1998 AMP and revisions to the FY 1997 AMP.  Public comment on these proposals, reprinted below, must be received by November 1, 1996 for the Committee to fully consider them as it reviews the proposed AMP.<P>

Under the authority of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act, as amended, DOD maintains a stockpile of strategic and critical materials to supply the military, industrial, and essential civilian needs of the United States for national defense.  In selling and acquiring Stockpile materials, DOD has a statutory obligation to refrain from causing undue market disruption, while at the same time protecting the U.S. Government against avoidable loss.<P>
  
Included with the <A HREF="registab.htm">AMP listing of materials</A> are the proposed maximum disposal quantities for each material.  These quantities are not sales target disposal quantities.  They are only a statement of the proposed maximum quantity of each material that can be sold during a particular fiscal year.  The quantity of each material that will actually be offered for sale will depend on the market for the material at the time as well as on the quantity of material approved for disposal by the Congress.  <P>

Also the <A HREF="registab.htm">AMP listing</A> is a list of new materials presently under consideration by the Congress for disposal authority in both FY 1997 and FY 1998.  The Committee is seeking public comment on the potential market impact of the sale of these materials in the event that Congress does grant such disposal authority.<P>

Meyers, Office of Strategic Industries and Economic Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, Tel.
