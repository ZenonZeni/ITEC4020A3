<h1 align=center>Wind Energy and the Hydrogen Economy</h1>

<p><img src="barc4.gif" border=0 height=3 width=580></p>

<p>Hydrogen production and storage represent the only readily available
technology that can reliably store renewable energy to supply the electricity
and fuel customers of the 21st century. Wind and solar power can seriously
compete with all other energy sources only when the hourly, daily and seasonal
variations can be effectively removed. Hydrogen production will accomplish
this with only slight modifications to the technologies already in use
in the conventional Oil &amp; Gas industries for the bulk transportation
of fluids and gases. </p>

<p>The company was granted a UK Patent in November 1995, detailing an efficient
methodology for the total conversion of wind (or solar) energy to hydrogen
via electrolysis of water. YGM is firmly committed to the development of
hydrogen as a fuel for use in fuel cells, boilers, gas turbines or conventional
internal combustion engines. The company is currently seeking partners
to develop a demonstration project. Partners could include other Small
and Medium Enterprise companies (SME’s) as defined by the EC commission,
or larger companies that represent the possible market for such a development.</p>
