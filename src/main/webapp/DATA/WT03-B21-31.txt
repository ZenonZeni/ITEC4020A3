<p>Spooks & Goblins & A Harvest Fair - Oh My! Grab your pumpkins and your shopping list. We are hosting a harvest fair at our annual haunted barn event. Oooooh, it's going to be so spooky and such fun! Be sure to mark your calendar for the weekend of October  26-27!  The Harvest Fair open daily at 11 a.m. and the revelry continues throughout the day. The haunted barn is alive with spooks and goblins from 5 to 7 p.m. </p>

<p>There will be games, refreshments, and surprises! We've enlisted the talents of a scald (storyteller of ancient days) to weave a few magical tales. All ages are welcome.
