<p>Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for Chase Manhattan Bank 
and I have something in common. We both have an interest in 
the cost of living, with mine going back many years when I 
did the research for the Congress of Industrial 
Organizations showing that during World War II workers' 
living costs went up much more than the amount recognized in 
the official Consumer Price Index (CPI).</p>

<p>A few years ago Kellner made a survey and found that the 
prices of products bought by the average family rose by 
about 12 percent a year. My survey - which I conducted at 
the local Shop-Rite - came to the same conclusion: Today I 
have to spend at least $20 for the same grocery items that I 
could get for between $14 and $17 less than a year ago.</p>

<p>And now the CPI is under renewed challenge. For some years 
the Wall Street Journal has been carping about the index, 
claiming it exaggerates increases in living costs. And now 
Alan Greenspan, chair of the Federal Reserve Board and 
establishment guru on economic matters, has joined the hue 
and cry. According to him, the CPI overstates the rise by 
between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent per year and should be 
revised downward.</p>

<p>And the pressure is building. A panel, headed by Michael J. 
Boskin, chief economist for President Bush, has "found," 
using "scientific studies," that the CPI overestimates 
living costs by as much as 2.0 percent per year.</p>

<p>Most government officials who deal with the economy support 
the change - except for Katherine Graham, commissioner of 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics who defends the existing 
index. But Democrats cannot be expected to offer serious 
opposition to demands for a downward revision of the CPI, as 
witnessed by New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's ardent 
support for such a revision.</p>

<p>Nor has the labor movement yet rallied its numbers to oppose 
these revisions. Instead, if the editors of Business Week 
are correct, union spokespersons say only that the panel 
"exaggerates the CPI's errors." If Boskin & Co. are to be 
defeated, organized labor should do more than oppose any 
reduction, it should call for an upward revision of the 
index.</p>

<p>But who cares whether the CPI goes up or down one or two 
percentage points? Does it make a real difference? And the 
answer is, "Yes, it makes a big difference - and workers 
will care plenty."</p>

<p>Alan Abelson, a columnist for Barron's Weekly, let the cat 
out of the in bag on Dec. 2 when he said, tongue-in-cheek, 
that the Boskin Commission was inspired by a Congress that 
"desperately needs a way to take the knife to Social 
Security without inciting the rage of the nation's 
politically potent old coots. Increases in Social Security 
payments are tied to inflation as measured by the CPI. Ergo, 
fiddling with the CPI is a perfect (read "blameless") way of 
diddling the geezers."</p>

<p>All federal social programs are linked to the CPI. Social 
Security payments will go up 2.9 percent in January because 
of the 2.9 percent increase in CPI. If the Boskin proposal 
to reduce the CPI were in effect, recipients would get only 
1.9 percent more. (When added up over 10 years, that one 
percent would amount to a 10 percent cut the tenth year.)</p>

<p>Similar downward adjustments in health and poverty programs 
would also be cumulative. Over a 10 year period, these 
adjustments would "save" the government $615 billion by 
taking the money out of the pockets of workers and their 
families. More billions would be taken by losses in benefits 
paid by state and city governments - and neither takes into 
account the disproportionate losses that would be borne by 
African Americans, Latinos and other racially- and 
nationally-oppressed minorities.</p>

<p>But the impact of Boskin would not be limited to those 
dependent on governmental benefit programs. Millions of 
workers are covered by union contracts that are linked to 
the CPI. Were wage increases cut by 1 percent each year for 
10 years it would cost workers $1,200 billion - bringing the 
total losses to nearly $2 trillion, with about a third 
coming from 18 million trade unionists.</p>

<p>I said earlier there was need for an upward revision in the 
CPI because it understates the rise in living costs. 
Consider, for instance, taxes - federal, state and local - 
that are taking more and more of workers' wages. But taxes 
aren't included in the CPI. If they were, it would increase 
the CPI and its rate of acceleration significantly.</p>

<p>And what about food, beginning with the fact that there has 
been a shift in consumption habits with millions of 
consumers recognizing that health and longevity require a 
reduction of the fat in their diet. As a result, there has 
been a shift away from eggs and red meat in favor of chicken 
and fish.</p>

<p>The CPI for food consists of several components, among them 
"fresh fish" (price up 96 percent since the index was last 
adjusted in 1987) and "meat and eggs" (price up 40 percent) 
But price alone does not take into account the share that 
fish and seafood now represents when compared with the total 
for meat, fish and eggs which the CPI puts at 7 percent. My 
calculations show that fish now represents at least 10 
percent of the total cost of meat, fish and eggs - a 
calculation more than substantiated by the line at the fish 
counter at Shop-Rite. Obviously, a correction here would be 
reflected in a higher CPI.</p>

<p>And what about automobiles? The Cost of Living Index for 
motor vehicles shows an increase to 143.8 percent since 
1982-84. But in the early 80s, the typical new car cost 
about $6-7,000. Today it is at least $14-15,000. What 
happened - and why?</p>

<p>Each year the BLS index allows liberal allowances for 
"quality improvement," in the finished product - 
improvements vouched for by none less than the auto makers 
themselves! Thus, the automobile component of the CPI goes 
up only 44 percent - and Cost of Living Adjustment to wages 
for auto workers are reduced and an understated CPI denies 
millions of people justifiable increases.</p>

<p>One could make similar calculations for medical care, and 
utilities, but these few examples typify the skullduggery.</p>

<p>Nor does the skullduggery end there. The Census Bureau has 
already finagled the index enough to wipe out part of the 
recent decline in family incomes and now proposes applying 
the new, indexes retroactively so as to statistically 
eliminate the decline in real wages - as if workers don't 
know they are getting shafted no matter how the data are 
manipulated!</p>

<p>The rationale I have seen for imposing the new criteria for 
CPI is that people are taking advantage of bargains. But 
there is no evidence that there are more bargains or that 
sales are more frequent than at other times - both factors 
that would have to exist for that argument to have merit.</p>

<p>Capitalist enthusiasm for the proposed "reforms" stems from 
the fact that workers' losses due to the changed indexes 
will mean corresponding escalation of capitalist profits. 
And there can be no doubt that the reduced expenditures for 
public benefits will strengthen, perhaps decisively, the 
capitalist campaign for reduction of their taxes - 
especially for slashing or eliminating the tax on capital 
gains, the means by which more and more of their profits are 
generated.</p>
