	Among the more outspoken proponents of alternative cancer therapies is Robert C. Atkins, M.D., nationally famous for his bestselling health books, Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revolution and Dr. Atkins’ Health Revolution. Early on, Dr. Atkins realized that many cancer patients were malnourished and that conventional oncologists were entirely ignoring nutritional support. He reasoned that the highly toxic approach of chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery weakened cancer patients and compromised their self-healing resources. In the late 1970s, Dr. Atkins began devising his own cancer treatment approach.<p>
	There is no better example of the weaknesses of our dominant medicine than its clearly ineffective war on cancer,” says Dr. Atkins. “By the same token, there is no better example of the superiority of complementary, alternative medicine than in the management of cancer.” Cancer, says Atkins, is a controllable chronic illness, but you have to support the body fully, making it stronger so it can fight the cancer.<p> 
	Atkins has supervised scores of cases in which cancer patients were getting worse, as indicated by blood tests, but then improved dramatically when he gave them nontoxic medicines now standard to his regimen.<p> 
	Using nutrition and botanicals, Dr. Atkins helps to create the ideal environment for the body to overcome cancer. In addition, he emphasizes substances that selectively make the tumor die while allowing normal, healthy cells and tissues to live, something chemotherapy is completely unable to do. If cancer is a tug of war between a patient and the disease, says Dr. Atkins, then you need “power pullers” on your side, natural substances that help the body destroy the cancer, usually by strengthening the immune system. “The exciting concept that mainstream oncologists do not grasp is that these are nontoxic approaches and that the benefit-to-risk ratio is nearly ‘infinity,’” says Dr. Atkins. “Therefore, there is no reason not to combine dozens of them into a single patient program.<p>
	Dr. Atkins’ protocols contain both a vigorous injectable program and day-long oral administration of nutritional and herbal therapies.<p><br>

<h4>THE INJECTABLE PROGRAM</h4><p>

	<b>UKRAIN.</b> This substance, derived from celandine (Chelidonium majus) and thiophosphoric acid, is a potent anticancer agent and a safe, supportive alternative to chemotherapy. It kills tumor cells while fortifying the immune system. Given by injection, optimal dosages are 5-20 mg per daily injection, for about 20 days. Of the first 52 people to whom Dr. Atkins administered one course of Ukrain, 40 experienced benefit. The greatest success in using Ukrain was a 93% remission rate with patients who started treatment when the cancer was in its earliest stage. Dr. Atkins regards Ukrain as the single best anticancer agent he has used to date.<p>
	<b>714X.</b> This substance, developed by Canadian biologist Gaston Naessens, is made from nitrogen-rich camphor and appears to neutralize a factor produced by tumor cells that ordinarily paralyzes the immune system. Naessens has documented the successful use of 714X against a variety of difficult cancers. “The 714X compound doesn’t kill the cancer cells directly, but blocks their feeding mechanism,” explains Dr. Atkins. Typically, Dr. Atkins injects 714X once daily into the groin lymph nodes for at least 21 consecutive days. In serious cases, he may use it without interruption until improvement is seen.<p>
	<b>ISCADOR/HELIXOR.</b> These are the European trade names for a preparation made from fermented mistletoe (Viscum album). It has been used effectively by doctors in Germany for cancer treatment since 1920. Originally conceived by Austrian scientist Rudolf Steiner, who worked closely with doctors, the therapeutic success of mistletoe as an anticancer agent has been reported in 5000 case studies. Dr. Atkins administers mistletoe through a series of 14 injections in increasing concentrations every other month, during the time in which Ukrain is not given.<p>
	<b>CARNIVORA&reg;.</b> This patented remedy, derived from Venus flytrap and developed by Helmut Keller, M.D., is used in German cancer clinics. Like Ukrain, Carnivora®, delivered by injection, appears to work by lessening the malignant characteristic of the tumor, rather than by destroying tissue, an approach not considered by oncologists, says Dr. Atkins. Among 210 of Dr. Keller’s patients with terminal cancer, 34 went into remission and 84 showed a halt in disease progression after using Carnivora®. Most Atkins Center patients take the Venus flytrap by drinking infusions of the whole plant as an herb tea.<p>
	<b>AMYGDALIN.</b> Also known as laetrile or vitamin B17, amygdalin is extracted from the pits of apricots, peaches, cherries, and berries; the active agent is called nitriloside. One study showed a 60% reduction in the spread of cancer to the lungs through using amygdalin. “Amygdalin is another key component for keeping cancer from growing and should be considered a standard, entirely safe treatment for all cancer patients,” says Dr. Atkins.<p>
	<b>OXYGENATING THERAPIES.</b> Dr. Atkins complements his intravenous program with an oxygen-providing preparation called DC4 (chlorine dioxide) which, when administered intravenously, releases oxygen in the form of ozone into the blood. Ozone itself may be administered with great success. Another injectable oxygen therapy called Koch’s glyoxylide “provides a constant oxygenating source and has a remarkable track record,” says Dr. Atkins.<p>
	<b>GLANDULAR EXTRACTS.</b> Dr. Atkins uses a variety of animal-derived glandular extracts to strengthen the immune system, including thymus (thymosin), liver, spleen, and pineal. Giving them by injection allows them to be more effectively absorbed by the body.<p><br>


<h4>THE ORAL PROGRAM</h4><p>

	<b>PANCREATIC ENZYMES.</b> Perhaps the most valuable of the oral supplements are pancreatic enzymes. Dr. Atkins’ patients take up to 30 capsules daily (over a 24-hour period) of crude pork pancreas extract. These enzymes “digest away the protective protein coating or shell which encases all tumors, leaving the cancer cells vulnerable,” explains Dr. Atkins. “Many of the successful cancer programs I have studied incorporate pancreatic enzymes.<p>
	<b>ANTIOXIDANTS.</b> Employing the full spectrum of antioxidants is part of every Atkins Center patient’s program, whether as treatment or prevention,” says Dr. Atkins. “These substances help protect cells’ genetic material and membranes from free radical damage, thereby preserving the cells’ normal functions. Antioxidants are a huge part of the body’s anticancer defenses. Dosages vary with individual needs, but the centerpiece is the recently maligned beta carotene. “The trick is to use natural beta carotene and to give all the supporting nutrients that allow the carotene to be converted to vitamin A,” Dr. Atkins says. When cancer is present, the dosage level approaches 100,000 I.U. daily. In addition, Dr. Atkins prescribes vitamin C in dosages up to about 10 g daily. Vitamin E strengthens the immune response; in one study, of 43 oral cancer patients who took 400 I.U. twice daily for 24 weeks, 46% showed strong improvement. Selenium works with vitamin E and may be the reason the study from Linxian, China, that used beta carotene showed it producing 13% fewer cancer deaths. Other antioxidants central to Dr. Atkins’ program are N-acetyl cysteine, glutathione, and lipoic acid; the latter has the effect of protecting all the other antioxidants. Coenzyme Q10, which has been linked to tumor regression at dosages of up to 390 mg daily, is included in the antioxidant program. Of importance, too, are the bioflavonoids, especially pycnogenol. Plant-based antioxidants, such as medicinal mushrooms, genistein (from soybeans), and green tea are on Dr. Atkin’s checklist also.<p>
	<b>SHARK CARTILAGE.</b> The tough, elastic connective tissue from sharks seems to prevent cancer tumors from developing new blood vessels and expanding their blood supply. Therefore, “as long as your body receives a hefty daily dose, you can keep tumors from growing,” says Dr. Atkins, who recommends on average 3 ounces of pulverized cartilage. An interesting alternative is a derivative called Car-T cell; here one vial containing only 1/2 tablespoon of active shark cartilage extract (first frozen, then defrosted) is taken daily under the tongue.<p>
	<b>ESSIAC.</b> This is an herbal formula, given as a tea, developed by the Canadian nurse Renee Caisse. Essiac’s main components include slippery elm, burdock, Indian rhubarb, and sorrel. It is known to strengthen the immune system, reduce drug toxicity, enhance energy, and sedate inflammations. “Such benefits may be mild in advanced-stage cancer therapy, but they can contribute to feelings of well-being which in turn influence the patient’s quality of life and potential for recovery,” says Dr. Atkins.<p>
	<b>CAT’S CLAW.</b> Chemical components of this rain-forest plant (Uncaria tomentosa) have a strong antioxidant effect, says Dr. Atkins. Cat’s claw may have greater therapeutic value than other prominent anticancer herbs such as astragalus, Echinacea, and goldenseal, he adds. A typical dosage for cat’s claw is 3-6 g daily but, for more advanced cases, you may need up to 20 g, Dr. Atkins advises.<p>
	<b>HOXSEY HERBS.</b> Originally developed by Harry Hoxsey in the 1950s and administered today in Tijuana, Mexico,  this herbal formula includes internal and external applications of substances such as bloodroot, potassium iodide, red clover, buckthorn bark, burdock root, Stillingia root, berberis root, pokeberry, licorice root, Cascara amarga, and prickly ash bark. “Decades of observation attest to their potential merit,” says Dr. Atkins, adding that of his patients who have used the Hoxsey formula, “many seem to get better.<p>
	<b>SIBERIAN GINSENG.</b> This form of ginseng, taken as a liquid extract, stimulates “natural killer cell” (NK) activity against cancer cells and may also help to regenerate NK cells destroyed by toxins or by toxic conventional treatments.<p> 
	<b>WHOLESOME DIET.</b> Dr. Atkins recommends following a sugarless diet, due to his faith in the teachings of Nobel Prize winner Otto Warburg, who demonstrated that cancer cells almost always depend upon anaerobic (without oxygen) nutrition, in which sugar is the primary fuel. Dr. Atkins also emphasizes eating vegetables, avoiding processed, refined foods, and using organically grown vegetables (preferably eaten raw) to maximize the absorption of their live enzyme content. He is reluctant to recommend a low protein diet because “so much of the biochemistry of the immune system is based on amino acids found in proteins. Illness is either worsened or bettered depending on your state of mind, says Dr. Atkins. All his therapies aim to enhance the patient’s mood, attitude, and psychological state as a means of facilitating the healing process and to avoid producing anxiety, depression, or despair, which commonly occur under conventional care. “Many of our patients come to us having been told they have 4 or 9 months to live. That can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. At the Atkins Center, the staff expect the patients to get well and stay well and the power of this positive expectation is contagious. According to Dr. Atkins, cancer survivors do not give in to the intimidation and mental toxicity of conventional medicine. The recent death of Jackie Kennedy Onassis shows how conventional medicine mistreats cancer. In effect, her oncologists had the attitude that “we’re either going to cure her or kill her,” as they poured chemotherapy into her early in the course of her treatment, says Dr. Atkins. When this intensely toxic treatment failed, Kennedy’s lymphoma sprinted away with her life. Her type of rapid demise is actually quite rare among patients who don’t receive chemotherapy. Summarizing his system, Dr. Atkins says, “The happy irony here is that there are 3 or 4 new therapies in the pipeline that appear sufficiently promising that they may one day make the entire Atkins Center program outmoded.<p>
