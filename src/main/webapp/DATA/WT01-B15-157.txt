<h4><u>Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF) Excavation.</u> View back toward the curve from the ESF North ramp into the ESF Main Drift taken from the rear of the TBM.

<u>Tunnel Boring Machine Operations.</u> View of laser alignment prisms in first curve. The lasers are used to guide the TBM and keep it on its intended alignment.

<u>Geological Mapping in the ESF</u>. The mapping gantry is situated behind the TBM's cutter head. It can be locked against the tunnel walls, allowing scientists to do tunnel photography, geologic mapping, and other tests without affecting TBM operations.

<u>ESF Test Alcove Excavation - 1. </u> These miners are using an Alpine Miner to excavate an alcove. The testing alcoves will be used by scientists to study hydrological, geochemical and geological conditions inside the mountain. A similar machine is currently being used to begin construction of the thermal testing alcove.

<u>ESF Test Alcove Excavation - 2.</u> Mining progress in Alcove 4. View from the rear of the Alpine Miner. Note the short conveyor belt used for removing rock from the excavation face.

<u>ESF Heater Test Alcove Excavation.</u> A different Alpine Miner is being used to excavate the harder rock at the location for the Heater Test Alcove. Currently, excavation is deep enough within the alcove for TBM operations to continue.

<u>ESF Testing.</u> Scientific Alcove 2 adjacent to the ESF starter tunnel. Ground water hydrology studies are underway here investigating permeability changes across the Bow Ridge Fault.

<u>Monitoring Pneumatic Conditions.</u> Workers are installing long-term monitoring instruments at a borehole into the unsaturated zone (UZ-4), where Nye County, Nevada, is conducting research. The monitoring established a baseline of the natural pneumatic (gas flow) and hydrologic conditions in the unsaturated zone, prior to the passage of the tunnel boring maching past this location.</h4></html>
