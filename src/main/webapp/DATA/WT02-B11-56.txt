<hr><b>The new basic social and health training programmes were introduced all over the country on 1 January 1991.</b><hr><br>
<br>
It is the aim of these courses to qualify staff in the welfare, care and nursing area for broadbased functions, so that patients and clients do not have to deal with so many different staff groups, when they find themselves in a situation where they need to make use of the care and welfare services.<br>
<br>
All these courses are generalist courses which replace the former more specialized courses leading to qualifications as a.o. home care assistants, occupational therapy assistants, practical mental nurses, practical nurses and nursing home assistants. It is the perspective to combine pedagogical/social and activating qualifications with nursing qualifications and thus obtain more preventive and resourceoriented work forms in the social and health sector.<br>
<br>
The new training system is structured in phases as a coordinated system with 3 qualification levels:<br>,       a 1½year advanced training programme for social and health service assistants,<br>
      further education courses leading to qualifications in nursing, socioeducational work etc. In order to continue with a further education programme, the students must pass an entrance examination, for which the detailed regulations have not yet been established.<br>
Furthermore, an introductory year has been established for young people who enter the courses directly from the 9th form of the Folkeskole, and for others who may need to attend this introductory year. The introductory year is not qualifying; it merely introduces the students to the work area. It consists of approx. 2/3 practical training and <br>
1/3 theory and contains a number of qualifying optional single subjects.<br>
<br>
The basic social and health training programmes are sandwichtype courses where practical training alternates with theoretical education. The courses consist of 2/3 practical training and 1/3 theory and comprise long practical training periods within the work area in question and theoretical instruction at a school.<br>
<br>
The theoretical instruction which takes part at a school comprises a number of obligatory area subjects.<br>
<br>
The training programme for social and health service helps comprises the following 5 obligatory area subjects:<br>
<br>
1. The practical subjectgroup.<br>
2. The culturalactivityrelated subjectgroup.<br>
3. The pedagogicalpsychological subjectgroup.<br>
4. The sociological and social subjectgroup.<br>
5. The nursing subjectgroup.<br>
<br>
The training programme for social and health service assistants comprises the following 6 obligatory area subjects:<br>
<br>
1. The workorganizational subjectgroup.<br>
2. The sociological and social subject-group.<br>
3. The culturalactivityrelated subjectgroup.<br>
4. The pedagogicalpsychological subjectgroup.<br>
5. The medical subjectgroup.<br>
6. The nursing subjectgroup.<br>
<br>
The practical training part of the training programme for social and health service helps comprises practical and personal assistance, activation and elementary nursing tasks. The practical training takes place in municipalities  in the homes of the clients and in nursing homes.<br>
<br>
The practical training part of the training programme for social and health service assistants comprises the main areas: care, activation and basic hygiene and nursing. The practical training takes place in municipalities and counties with 1/3 in the municipality and 2/3 in the county. A great part of the county-based practical training shall take place within the somatic hospital service.<br>
<br>
It is furthermore possible to take part in optional qualifying courses against a reduction in the practical training of a maximum of one month in the case of the basic course and 1½ months in the case of the advanced course. The qualifying optional subjects are meant to give the students a ballast of general knowledge, strengthen their personal development and qualify them for further education and training.<br>
<br>
<b>Admission</b><br>
In order to be admitted to the training programmes for social and health service helps and assistants, the students must have a practical training place.<br>
<br>
In each county  region, a joint board has been set up which  on an annual basis, and on the basis of the total projected need of staff of the region  shall decide on how many practical training places it is necessary to set up in the region.<br>
<br>
The students shall enter into a training agreement with the municipality and/or county and is thus ensured a place both in the theoretical and in the practical part of the training programme.<br>
<br>
<b>Financial situation of students</b><br>
The students are paid a salary during the training programme, but not in the introductory year. The salary reflects the extent to which the student is expected to take part in the work of the practical training place. The salary and working conditions are laid down in an agreement which has been made between the main bargaining organizations of the particular work area. The salary amounts to approximately 50% of the salary of a graduate.<br>
<br>
<b>Assessment</b><br>
The work and achievement of the students are assessed during the whole training programme. The assessment is given on the basis of examinations, assignments or as general proficiency statements on completion of a practical training period. The Ministry of Education appoints external examiners for the final examinations. They shall ensure quality and homogeneity in the training programmes and ensure that the students are given an objective and fair assessment.<br>
<br>
<b>Certification</b><br>
Upon completion of the training programme, the student is given a certificate. The certificate contains the following information: the title of the training programme, the examination results, the general proficiency statements as well as the type of practical training places.<br>
<br>
Persons with qualifications obtained before 1991 may also acquire competence as social and health service helps or social and health service assistants in specially organised upgrading courses.<br>
