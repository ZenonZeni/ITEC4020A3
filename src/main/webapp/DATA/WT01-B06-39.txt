The 21 Benefits of Membership in AAII</H2>


Here are the 21 benefits we offer to our members--they are provided free with membership or at special member prices . . .<P>



       <strong> #1  The AAII Journal (free to members) --</strong> Published 10 times a year, the Journal provides you with a continuing stream of information on investment.  Recent topics include: how you can reduce risk;  how to evaluate investment newsletters; how a living trust can help with your estate planning; the characteristics of stock market winners; comparing insurance products objectively.  The "Points of View" section interviews leading professional money managers and examines their approaches to managing investments--stocks, high yield bonds, muni bonds, real estate, convertibles.<P>


        Articles in the Journal always focus on how you can improve your results.  While some articles cover the latest findings of academic research, there are also articles by experienced practitioners such as Peter Lynch, John Bogle, T. Boone Pickens, Robert Stovall, Ken Gregory and Mark Hulbert.<P>



<strong>
        #2  Shadow Stock Coverage (free to members) -- </strong> A special section of the Journal provides the results of screens that many investors use to select stocks (P/E ratio, debt/equity, book value, earnings growth, etc.).  These screens can save you considerable time in your search for undervalued stocks. They emphasize the "Shadow Stocks"--stocks ignored by institutions because of size and not covered much by analysts . . . but solid and profitable.  <P>



<strong>        #3  The "Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds" (free to members) -- </strong> Mailed to you in March each year, this book provides in-depth analysis of over 800 funds and discusses how to select the best funds for you.  Awarded the only four star (top) rating by Kiplinger's Personal Finance, this widely acclaimed book sells to the general public for $24.95, but as an AAII member it is yours free.  Barron's calls it "...one of the best books around on the subject."  Most of our members use mutual funds for at least part of their portfolio and this book represents only part of our coverage of this important topic.  <P>



<strong>        #4  Local Chapter Membership --</strong> There are over 60 chapters now operating in metropolitan areas and more are being added.  Chapters offer the opportunity to meet with fellow members and to hear experts discuss a variety of investment topics.  The similarity of interests has led to close personal relationships among members and the development of many SIGS (special interest subgroups) in such areas as computers, real estate investment, mutual funds and stock screening approaches.  As a member you can participate with no additional dues.<P>



<strong>        #5  AAII Year-End Tax Strategy Guide (free to members) -- </strong>Each year at the end of November members receive an extensive guide to the tax planning aspects of investment.  The guide is based on the latest laws and rulings.<P>



<strong>        #6  AAII Quoteline (free to members) --</strong> AAII Quoteline permits you to use your phone to obtain real time (not delayed) quotes on stocks, options, and mutual funds.  You may also establish a theoretical portfolio with a number of shares and receive the current value of each stock and the entire portfolio at any time.<P>



<strong>        #7  Investment Seminars (at reduced cost) --</strong> Over 50 seminars are conducted in cities throughout the United States each year -- from introductory to advanced in a variety of subjects.  We also have seminars on video. Each seminar is designed to provide practical ways to improve your investment results.<P>



<strong>        #8  Study Programs (at reduced cost) --</strong> AAII offers a wide variety of home study materials to its members.  These materials are constantly being expanded and revised and are designed to take individual investors as far as they want to go--from basics to the concepts of a graduate course in investment theory.  <P>



<strong>        #9  Computer Users Newsletter --</strong> Because a growing number of members are using computers in their investment decision making, AAII publishes an optional bimonthly newsletter.  This publication, Computerized Investing, evaluates software and explores a variety of ways to make the computer a more effective investment tool.  The price of Computerized Investing is $40/year to the public, but only $30/year to members.<P>



<strong>        #10  The "Individual Investor's Guide to Computerized Investing" --</strong> Subscribers to Computerized Investing also receive our annual 200+ page guide to investment software and databases at no additional cost.<P>
 
 

<strong>        #11  AAII "Stock Investor" --</strong> For computer users this is our newest optional service -- quarterly disks providing well over 100 items of the latest information from the Market Guide database.  This service covers 6000 stocks and has powerful screening capabilities.  Available to members at a fraction of the cost of comparable products.<P>



<strong>        #12  Dividend Reinvestment Plans --</strong> Hundreds of major corporations allow you to buy additional stock with your dividends, without commissions and often at a below market price.  AAII members receive a free listing of these companies each June with "how to" information. The information is also on the "Stock Investor" computer program.<P>



<strong>        #13  Stock Brokerage Survey --</strong> Each January you receive free our survey of the charges and services of brokerage firms.  This free coverage also provides an analysis to help you choose the pricing system and service package that best suits your individual needs.<P>



<strong>        #14 "A Lifetime Strategy for Investing in Common Stocks" --</strong> This booklet described at the end of this letter is yours free.<P>



<strong>        #15  Publication Discounts --</strong> Substantial discounts are available on investment software and investment publications (i.e., Money, Investor's Business Daily, Business Week, Financial World).  And through Standard & Poor's Corporation we have arranged for members to receive S&P reports for a number of corporations at no cost.<P>



<strong>        #16  Special Credit Card --</strong> Members are eligible to apply for a special AAII Gold Visa Card with no annual fees, with very special privileges, and a very competitive interest rate (prime plus 6.9%). <P>


<strong>
        #17  The "Best of Both Worlds" Money Market --</strong> Members can also participate in a special AAII money market bank account--a bank money market account that guarantees a yield above the average of all money market mutual funds and provides the FDIC insurance of a bank.  The best of both worlds. This single benefit could earn you much more than the membership dues.  <P>
        
        

<strong>        #18  Quarterly Low-Load Mutual Fund Update --</strong> This new optional service provides information quarterly on all the funds covered in our Low-Load Guide.  It is available in print or on computer disk.<P>

        

<strong>        #19  Research - The Hidden Benefit --</strong> The value of the AAII Journal, our seminars and all of our materials is enhanced by the internal research of our staff.  In addition, we screen current academic research (often before publication) to find insights into improving investment performance.  We not only report on that research, but we sponsor much of it by awards to university faculty and doctoral students.<P>



<strong>        #20  AAII Website -</strong> You're already taking advantage of the interactive forum we provide to distribute and communicate with our members. <P>
 

   That's who we are, what we do, and our specific programs.  AAII is a totally independent non-profit association.  We don't even accept advertising in our Journal.  And we grow and change to meet the needs of our members.  We will continue to do so with, we hope, your participation and insight.  There is no other source for this combination of help and support.<P>


        Our dues are only $49 per year.  A single insight gained from our Journal, a seminar or other AAII program will repay the membership cost many times over.  In fact, the publication discounts and other special benefits alone may exceed the dues.  As Forbes says, "The $49 a year it costs to belong is a bargain."  <P>



<strong>        And Benefit #21 </strong>  You risk nothing by joining ....Because we cannot fully explain AAII in a letter online, we make this promise:  If you decide at any time during the year after joining that AAII is not contributing to your investment skills, we will refund your annual membership dues in full -- no questions.  We offer this unusual assurance because not only do most of our members renew each year, but over 30% have become Lifetime Members.  This policy also applies to Computerized Investing.<P>

        
        We are not offering any magic formula for overnight riches. The key to successful management of your assets requires self-discipline and a reasonable investment of time and effort.<P>
