What You Should Know About Derivatives and Mutual Funds </H2><P>
<HR>

There has been much talk lately about derivatives and their use in mutual fund portfolios. If you are like most investors, you are wondering if and how these strange products are affecting your mutual funds. Although derivatives can be hard to describe because of their complexity and variety, it is still possible for you to understand their potential impact on your mutual fund investments.<P>


What are they?<P>


Derivatives are financial arrangements that are derived from, or whose performance is tied to, the changing value of an underlying security (for instance, a stock or a bond), a commodity (including currency), or a market index.<P>


You have probably at least heard of some traditional derivatives--options, futures, and currency forwards are the best-known examples. These contractual arrangements have existed for some time and are for the most part actively traded, either on an exchange or over-the-counter.<P>


In recent years, investment bankers have developed more complicated arrangements that have been dubbed "exotic" or "complex" derivatives. These include synthetic securities created from traditional securities such as bonds, and derivative contracts, which are custom-tailored contractual arrangements between two or more parties. <P>


Exotic derivatives are traded over the counter--through a dealer who makes markets in them--or directly between financial institutions; there is no formal standardized trading mechanism. Thus, the liquidity of exotic derivatives varies, as does their complexity and risk.<P>


The table at the end of this article provides a brief description of some of the more commonly used derivatives.<P>


While the risk of individual derivatives varies greatly, the biggest risk facing mutual fund investors is not the kinds of derivatives used, but rather how they are used. For instance, certain derivatives can be used to reduce portfolio risk, even though the derivative on its own is risky. This perhaps can best be termed manager risk--how the fund's portfolio manager uses derivatives in the portfolio, and in particular, whether the use is appropriate considering the fund's investment category.<P>


Fixed-income funds have received most of the attention regarding derivative use, but all kinds of funds use derivatives--although keep in mind that not all funds use derivatives (many, in fact, do not) and that many funds that do use them invest in them to only a limited extent. 


How do funds use derivatives? The primary uses are:<P>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Hedging:</STRONG> Some funds use certain derivatives as a hedge. A good example are currency forwards, used by both stock and bond international funds to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations. Fixed-income derivatives can also be used as a hedge to reduce interest rate risk--for instance, a manager can quickly adjust a portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate changes by either buying or selling Treasury bond futures without having to sell any of the bonds in the portfolio, providing greater flexibility while keeping transaction costs low. <P>


<LI><STRONG>Liquidity:</STRONG> Futures are used by some funds, such as stock index funds, to maintain liquidity. A futures position requires only a small initial deposit, so a fund can maintain a fully invested exposure to the stock market, while keeping cash on hand for redemptions--a cheaper and more efficient management method than selling individual stocks to meet redemptions.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Substitutes:</STRONG> Certain derivatives have the same characteristics of the underlying securities, but may be cheaper. For instance, it may be cheaper to buy the Treasury bond future than to buy the underlying Treasury bonds.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Yield Enhancement:</STRONG> Some funds use certain derivatives to enhance yield, usually by taking on some additional risk. For instance, a fund manager may exploit small differences between bond sectors--he may buy futures based on long-term municipal bonds and sell futures based on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, taking advantage of the difference in those two markets. Some of the more complex derivatives are also used for yield enhancement.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Taking a Specific Position on the Direction of Certain Interest Rates:</STRONG> Structured notes are often used for this, since they can be tailored to the portfolio manager's specific view. For instance, in one typical kind of agreement, the security may be tied to changes in short-term interest rates, but multiplied by 10 to produce changes in value similar to that of a 10-year bond. Since short-term bonds do not change in value as much as long-term bonds given a change in rates, this allows a portfolio manager with an opinion regarding short-term interest rates to receive the same potential for gain (or loss) as if he had purchased a long-term bond.<P>
</UL>

All of these uses require judgment and knowledge concerning the proper use of the derivative. However, the greatest risks are introduced when managers use derivatives to take specific positions on the direction of rates. If their forecasts are incorrect, losses can be large.<P>


Yield enhancement also introduces risks, particularly if the manager miscalculates and takes on risk that is inappropriate for the fund's category type.<P>


Certain funds that most investors would consider extremely conservative--some short-term government bond funds, for example--have dabbled in derivatives to try to boost yield. Why? Funds that are limited in choice to a specific sector, such as government bonds, and particularly to a specified maturity level, tend to have very similar yields. In order to boost yields and distinguish themselves, they must do something "different" from other funds. There are two ways such a fund can "boost" return--lower expenses or invest differently than other funds. If the fund can invest in derivatives, it can stay within its category yet take on the higher yields--and higher interest rate risk--of longer-term securities. <P>


Should you be concerned about the use of derivatives in your mutual fund?<P>


The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently examining the use of derivatives in mutual funds, as well as their disclosure. But no proposals have yet been issued. Until then, it isn't a bad idea to make sure you understand what your funds can and cannot invest in. Here are some steps you can take:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Check the prospectus to see what the fund is permitted to invest in. Make sure to read the full prospectus, and don't look for any statement concerning "derivatives." Instead, look for specific categories, such as forwards, futures, CMOs, and structured notes. Unfortunately, some funds do not disclose their derivative practices in prospectuses.<P>


<LI>Check the shareholder reports, which are required to disclose portfolio holdings, and see if there are investments that may appear to be derivatives. Again, you will not see a category labeled derivatives, but rather specific holdings, and they may be tough to spot. Also keep in mind that the fund may have invested in derivatives in the interim, but was not invested in them at the time of the report. In addition, many derivatives are listed in the "footnote" section of fund reports, since many are considered off-balance-sheet items.<P>


<LI>As a double-check, and since some funds don't disclose derivative use in prospectuses, call the fund, ask for shareholder relations, and ask whether the fund can invest in derivatives and if so, whether it currently holds any.<P>


<LI>Check the return performance of the fund, particularly if it is in a conservative or limited investment fixed-income category. Is the yield much higher than other similar funds, and if so, why? Be sure to take the expense ratio into consideration--a fund with an average yield but a higher than average expense ratio should be viewed as carefully as a fund with an above-average yield.<P>
</UL>

If a fund you are examining does use derivatives, keep in mind these questions:<P>

<UL>
<LI>To what extent are derivatives used? Some funds use them only to a limited extent. Some fund families are limiting themselves to a 5% investment in derivatives, which can serve as a conservative benchmark.<P>


<LI>How are the derivatives being used? The conservative uses include hedging and risk reduction, and to achieve liquidity. If they are used for yield enhancement, are the additional yields worth the added risk? If they are used to take a specific position on the direction of interest rates, do you trust the manager's ability to correctly forecast rates?<P>
</UL>

Here's the bottom line question:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Is the use of derivatives appropriate for the type of fund? It would be less disconcerting for an investor in a more aggressive fund to see derivatives used, for instance, for yield enhancement. Losses due to the use of derivatives would be most shocking to investors in a very conservative fund with preservation of capital as an objective.<P>

<STRONG>Table. Definitions of Derivatives</STRONG>

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs):</STRONG> Securities derived from a group of mortgages that are divided into "tranches," classes that receive different pieces of interest and principal payments. Includes planned amortization class (PACs), structured to possess less prepayment risk, and support class, structured to absorb a higher level of prepayment risk. Can be used to enhance yield or reduce risk, depending on the class. Risk varies greatly.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Forward:</STRONG> An agreement to buy or sell a security at a specified price on a specified date. These agreements are not traded on exchanges. Forwards can be based on many kinds of assets, including currencies. Often used by funds to hedge currency risk when trading in foreign securities.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Future:</STRONG> An agreement to buy or sell a specific security at a specified price on a specified date; these contracts are standardized and traded on an exchange. Futures are based on many kinds of assets including stocks, bonds, indexes, currencies, and commodities. Used for a wide variety of purposes. Risk varies with underlying security; market risk is high due to leverage. <P>


<LI><STRONG>Interest Only Strips (IOs) and Principal Only Strips (POs):</STRONG> Securities derived from a bond (including Treasury bonds) or a mortgage-backed security, that provides only interest payments (IOs) or principal payments (POs) of the underlying issue. Has high market risk. Also has high liquidity risk.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Interest Rate Swaps:</STRONG> An arrangement between two parties that provides for an exchange of a series of cash flows at specified dates in the future--for instance, a series of fixed-rate interest payments may be exchanged for a series of variable-rate payments, although swaps can also be based on currencies and stocks. Risk varies with underlying security.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Inverse Floater (sometimes known by acronyms RIBs and IFRNs):</STRONG> A security derived from a bond (including municipal bonds) or a mortgage security that offers higher yields than the underlying security but is subject to much greater interest rate risk. As interest rates change, the coupon paid also changes, magnifying the effect of rate changes on its value. Has high market risk. Also has high liquidity risk.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Options</STRONG> The right (but not an obligation) to buy or sell a security at a specified time for a specified price. Exchange-traded options are standardized contracts. Options are based on many kinds of assets, including stocks, bonds, stock and bond indexes, and currencies. Often used to hedge, and to provide yield enhancement. Can have high market risk.<P>


<LI><STRONG>Structured Notes (also referred to as Indexed Securities):</STRONG> Agreements where interest rate and/or principal are tied to an indicator (such as short-term interest rates, the price of oil, etc.); terms can vary widely and are tailored to specific needs. Can have high market risk, depending on amount of leverage built into security. Also has high liquidity risk.<P>
