<H2><P>	Seriously ill people who use marijuana as medicine should not be arrested
and required to prove their medical necessity in a criminal trial.
Seriously ill patients should have their claims heard by the Iowa Board of
Pharmacy Examiners or some other qualified board.  If a seriously ill
patient has a legitimate medical necessity, that patient should be certified
and be exempted from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa.  The Iowa
Legislature should amend current state law by immunizing certified medical
marijuana users from criminal prosecution by the state of Iowa and call upon
the federal government to amend existing federal statutes.
<P>	Iowa recognizes the defense of "medical necessity" to prosecution for the
possession of marijuana in the state of Iowa.  State of Iowa v. Jan Pleas,
No. 22690, Pottawattamie District Court (June 16, 1994).  Iowa law
recognizes the therapeutic value of marijuana.  Iowa Code § <A HREF="http://www2.legis.state.ia.us/IACODE/1995/124/206.html">124.206</A>(7)(a).
<P>	Between 1976 and 1991, the federal government supplied marijuana to
patients for medical purposes.  In 1991, the federal government decided to
stop supplying marijuana to new applicants.  Only two Iowans are currently
allowed to use marijuana legally, because of federal law prohibiting the use
of marijuana.  Other Iowans who were approved to receive marijuana were
never supplied.
<P>	It is not fair that all Iowans are not treated alike, some having arbitrary
rights that others do not have.

<P>	QUESTION:  Do you support enacting medical necessity legislation which
would exempt certain medical marijuana users from criminal prosecution in
the state of Iowa?</H2>
<P>
<H1>YES
<P>
NO
<P>
NOT SURE</H1>
