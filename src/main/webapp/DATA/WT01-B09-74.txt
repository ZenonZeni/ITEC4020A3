<blockquote>

<B>Project Title: The Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project<p>
Performing Organization: Evermont
</B>


<P><B>Program Description</B></P>


<P>The Verrnont Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project was awarded a third grant from the
Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and the Northeast
Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC) to continue further development of electric vehicle
battery and cabin thermal management systems to address issues of cabin comfort and
winter range. This grant funds the Northern Region Thermal Management Technology
Project which continues electric vehicle testing and data acquisition and technology
development in Vermont</P>

<P><B>Project Goals</B></P>

<P>The Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project will focus on five specific
areas of electric vehicle technology development. 
</P>

<P>First, battery thermal management for lead-acid and nickel metal hydride batteries will be
analyzed and improved. Improving battery thermal management will contribute to increased
vehicle range and improved performance in cold temperatures. To address this issue, one l9^
Solectria Force vehicle will be designed with an advanced battery box to improve battery
thermal management and one 1996 Solectria Force will be powered by nickel metal
hydride batteries. </P>

<P>Second. cold weather technologies will be refined and advanced. The Northeast Advanced
Thermal Management Technology Project (NATMTP) selected and integrated fuel fired
heaters into Solectria Force sedans and determined that a S kilowatt fuel fired coolant
beater provides optimum cabin comfort. NATMTP also tested tires, low viscosity
lubricants, healed seats ant steering wheels, a desiccant wheel and thermal windshields.
The Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project will build on these
technologies and continue to improve heat conservation and retention. Specifically, a cabin
preheat system will be advanced and adapted for a remote control, a fuel fired heater will
he integrated into an E­10 pickup truck and vehicle insulation will be improved. </P>

<P>Third, the Northern Region Thermal Management Technology Project will develop a
lightweight air conditioning system to integrate with heating systems in electric vehicles.
Lightweight air conditioners will decrease vehicle weight thereby increasing efficiency and
vehicle performance. Furthermore, the integration of heating and air conditioning increases
consumer acceptance and marketability of electric vehicles. </P>

<P>Fourth, a thermal energy management control system will he investigated. Through this
investigation it will be determined whether a single control system should coordinate
battery and cabin heating. A coordinated system may be able to maximize the use of
waste heat for cabin heating. </P>

<P>Fifth, the potential utility and desirability of an auxiliary power unit (APU) will be
investigated. An APV could provide additional power to recharge and increase vehicle
range. Its waste heat could be utilized to increase cabin healing. While an APU may
improve vehicle range, its adaption into electric vehicles must also be evaluated to avoid
compromising the current lack of noise and air pollution achieved by electric vehicles.</P>
