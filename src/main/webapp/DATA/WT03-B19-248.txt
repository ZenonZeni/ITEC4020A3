International comparison of business costs
</H1>

On the grounds of comparative costs, Victoria is an attractive destination 
for new business investment. A cost benchmarking study undertaken by the 
international firm, KPMG Management Consulting, for the Department of 
State Development, compared major business costs in Melbourne 
with several other significant cities including Sydney, Brisbane, Auckland, 
Bangkok, Guangzhou, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Los Angeles, Osaka, 
Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Stuttgart. 
<P>
Comparisons were made in the benchmarking study of the relative costs of 
utilities (electricity, gas and water), research and development, 
telecommunications, transport and freight, labour and capital items.
<P>
The benchmarking study showed that Melbourne was particularly cost-competitive 
in:
<UL>
<LI> industrial land and factory and warehouse construction;
<LI> factory and warehouse rental;
<LI> office rental;
<LI> senior management and professional labour costs;
<LI> transport;
<LI> telecommunications;
<LI> high voltage electricity; and
<LI> gas.
</UL>
<BR>
The report also showed that the quality of these resources is very high 
and, relative to other cities in the region, are readily available. The 
report shows conclusively that Melbourne is a particularly competitive 
location for services and manufacturing industries which rely upon highly 
skilled labour and infrastructure services.
<P>
The benchmarking study confirmed that business and government in Victoria 
is internationally minded and that the significant improvements in cost 
performance that have already been achieved are an on-going process.
