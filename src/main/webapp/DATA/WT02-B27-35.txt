<FONT SIZE="+2"><B><I>The Story:</I></B></FONT>
<HR>

Uchida has been asked to join the morning hospital rounds at Children's
Hospital in Winnipeg. It's around 1960. She's talking about the
symptoms of trisomy of the 18th chromosome--having three #18 chromosomes 
instead of the normal two--when a doctor named Jack
Sinclair raises his hand and says, "Hey, I think we have one of those
on the 4th floor." <P>

He takes her up to the ward right away and they get
a blood sample and add some anticlotting agent. She immediately goes
to work to identify the chromosomes. This was something very new, and had
never been done by anybody in Winnipeg. <P>

First she lets the red blood
cells settle in the vial, then she takes the white blood cells off the
top with a pipette. She puts them in a glass container about 1" by 2.5"
long containing a medium where they grow and multiply for three
days inside an incubator. Then she takes out the liquid and
centrifuges it down, then fixes the cells with acetic acid solution, 
then drops them
onto a glass slide so the cells break and spill out their chromosomes.
She stains this and looks for the chromosomes under the microscope.<P>

The room she's in has the vinegary smell of acetic acid. Low tables by
the windows have lots of microscopes with technicians in white lab
coats seated at most of them. High benches where they make their
preparations are over along the opposite wall. Uchida was able to
identify the chromosomes that day as being 18 trisomy and this was a
first for Winnipeg and Canada.<P>

<B>History:</B><BR>

Irene Uchida was born in Vancouver, BC. Her father, who was brought to
Canada as a young man, ran a Japanese stationery and book store and was
chairman of the board of the Alexander Language School.<P>

She joined Canadian Girls in Training at the Powell Street United
Church. She served as organist for services and choir work, and was
also in demand as pianist for meetings as she could play any request
by ear.<P>

At UBC she was a member of the Japanese Students Club, Cosmopolitan
Club and a violinist in the UBC orchestra which provided the music for
their annual productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas. She also
served as a reporter for The New Canadian, a weekly Japanese
Canadian newspaper in Vancouver. During WWII, she was very active in
the Japanese Canadian Citizens for Democracy which played a vital role
for the Japanese community in Toronto and nationally as well. This was
a period of great anxiety for all the Japanese who were uprooted from
their homes in BC by an Order-in-Council of the Federal Government.<P>

In 1942 she was evacuated from her comfortable home in Vancouver to
Christina Lake, a self-supporting centre of the Japanese, but was
called shortly afterward to act as principal of the largest Japanese
camp school in the Kootenays at Lemon Creek. Her innovative ideas
developed unusual programs for extracurricular activities which did
much to stimulate the youth in creative pastimes.<P>

Two years later she moved to continue her education at Victoria College 
(University of Toronto), 
graduating in 1946 with a BA and also winning the Ramsay
Wright Scholarship. Although she had planned to take up Social Work,
she was persuaded by one of her professors to enter the field of
genetics.<P>

In 1951 Dr. Uchida received her PhD in Zoology from the U of T and
began her career as a Research Associate at the Hospital for Sick
Children in Toronto. Her work in genetics involved the study of twins,
mongolism, children with congenital heart diseases and those with a
variety of other abnormalities. The studies on twins are still
ongoing.<P>

In 1959, while working with Drosophila fruit flies at the U of
Wisconsin on a Rockefeller Fellowship, she turned her attention to
human chromosomes. When scientists in France discovered that
mongoloids had an extra chromosome (47 instead of 46), Dr. Uchida
decided to try to learn the cause of the extra chromosome. She was
appointed Director of the Dept of Medical Genetics at the Childrens
Hospital, Winnipeg, in 1960.<P>

In her first study of human chromosomes, Dr. Uchida found that there
appeared to be an association between maternal radiation and Down
syndrome (mongolism). Then in 1969 with a Medical Research Council grant she
went as a visiting scientist to the University of London and
Harwell, England, to study the technique for analyzing the
chromosomes of mouse ova.<P>

Dr. Uchida continued her research on the effects of radiation on
humans and mice at the McMaster University Medical Centre, as well as
carrying out her teaching duties as a professor. As Director of the
Cytongenetics Laboratory, she had responsibilities which included the
diagnosis of chromosome abnormalities in patients with congenital
abnormalities, mental retardation and other genetic diseases as well
as prenatal diagnosis of chromosome anomalies. She was the
geneticist who worked with doctors  on the Genetic Counseling Program
that she initiated at the McMaster Medical Centre. She has published
papers on the effects of radiation, abnormalities in chromosomes, etc.
She has been invited to speak in many countries and is a member of
various provincial, national and international scientific
organizations.<P>

<HR>
Cytogenetics is the study of chromosomes in cells. It concentrates on the
behaviour and identification of chromosomes.<P>

<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/uchida-graphic.gif>
<BR>
1. Banding<BR>
Our 23 pairs of chromosomes have tens of thousands of genes 
that carry the information
needed to create a unique person. For each pair, one comes from
your Dad, the other from your Mom. The bands indicate different types of DNA.
Geneticists use the bands to match the pairs.<P>

2. X & Y chromosomes<BR>
You can tell by Jodi's two X chromosomes that she is a girl. Boys have
one X and one Y chromosome.<P>

3. Chromosome 21<BR>
About 1 child in 700 is born with Down syndrome. It's caused by the
accidental tripling of chromosome 21 during conception. Normally you
have 23 pairs of chromosomes. Other genetic diseases are caused by
tripling of number 13 or 18. This is called "trisomy". People with
trisomy of chromosomes 13 or 18 usually die as fetuses, resulting
in miscarriages. Those who are born alive do not usually live more
than a year. To find out more about human genetic diseases visit the
<A HREF="http://www-medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/CYTGHTML/CYTOGIDX.html">WebPath
database of cytogenetic diseases</A>.<P>

4. Jodi<BR>
Special Olympics champion and actor Jodi Kaczur with actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger. Down syndrome people are not so handicapped as
people think. They are very happy, generally affectionate and always
nice people.<P>

<IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/css/gcs/graphics/uchida_spread.gif><BR>

This is a typical chromosome spread that cytogeneticists routinely 
examine and sort under a microscope. Try to pair up the chromosomes
and see if you can discover if this person has Down Syndrome or some
other form of trisomy. You can print out this page and cut the chromosomes
out with scissors, then move them around and match them up.<P>

<B>Mystery for Next Generation: </B><P>

Find out how to inactivate one of the chromosomes in a 'tri'
individual. Since this happens naturally in all women--one of their X
chromosomes is always inactivated--this technique might "cure" some of
these genetic diseases in the parent or at an early embrionic stage.<P>
