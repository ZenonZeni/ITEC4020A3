<H2>Trials Find Olanzapine Treats Schizophrenia</H2></center>

 <HR>


	Data gathered during a double-blind, randomized study involving 1,996 patients and 174 investigators in 17 countries suggest that olanzapine--Eli Lilly and Company's investigational antipsychotic--may treat both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  (Positive symptoms include delusions and hallucinations, and negative symptoms include diminished emotions and low motivation.)  Many currently available, older antipsychotic medications are perceived as having little or no effect on negative symptoms.
<P>
	Study subjects were randomly selected to receive either olanzapine or haloperidol, the antipsychotic drug most often globally prescribed for the treatment of schizophrenia.  Patients treated with olanzapine showed statistically significant improvements in overall symptoms, improvements in negative symptoms, and improvements in drug-induced side-effects such as Parkinson's disease-like symptoms (rigidity, tremors), akathisia (an inability to sit still), and dyskinetic involuntary muscle movements (tardive dyskinesia).  The most common side effects associated with olanzapine were insomnia, dry mouth, akathisia, and nervousness.  There were no reported cases of agranulocytosis, a sometimes fatal blood disorder that has been reported in 1 to 2 percent of patients who take clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic used as a treatment for schizophrenia.
<P>
	Eli Lilly and Company is seeking worldwide approval to market olanzapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.
