<body><h2>2. Program and Project Activities: Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Introduction </h4>
<p>
This section describes the near-term activities planned under the revised program strategy, and
provides redefined schedule targets. The section also addresses some of the longer-term activities
contemplated, based on the assumption that the Yucca Mountain site is found suitable and that
the President and the Congress provide further direction regarding interim storage policy. <em>Section
2.1</em> addresses activities of the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project, <em>Section 2.2</em>
describes Waste Acceptance, Storage, and Transportation Project activities, and <em>Section 2.3</em>
describes support activities to be conducted by the Management Center.
<p>
<h4>2.1 Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project</h4>
<p>
<strong>Background</strong><br>

The 1988 Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project's <em>Site Characterization Plan</em>, required by
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, had a threefold purpose: (1) to describe the Yucca Mountain site
and preliminary designs for a repository and waste package; (2) to identify issues related to the
Yucca Mountain site's suitability as a repository, based on our level of knowledge about the site
in 1988, that could be resolved during site characterization, and to identify a strategy for
resolving these issues; and (3) to describe plans for a comprehensive program of scientific
investigations and engineering design that could be conducted to obtain sufficient information to
resolve these issues. Our level of knowledge about the site has increased over the last decade as
we collected and analyzed scientific data from the surface and subsurface. This knowledge has
enabled us to evolve our strategy. This evolution, together with the recognition that the level of
resources that would be required to carry out the full program described in the <em>Site
Characterization Plan</em> had not been provided, led to our 1994 Program Plan. Substantial progress
in the past few years in scientific investigations and underground construction, combined with
the necessity to determine the least costly acceptable work plan, has resulted in this revision to
our 1994 Program Plan.
<p>
The 1994 Program Plan represented a fundamental change in the site characterization strategy.
Scientific investigations and engineering design activities were re-prioritized to assure that
information would be available to support an early evaluation of technical site suitability of the
Yucca Mountain site in 1998. In addition, concurrent work on the development of an
Environmental Impact Statement and license application was planned, with the expectation that
this work would continue beyond the suitability determination and result in a Final
Environmental Impact Statement, Record of Decision, and site recommendation in 2000.
Confirmatory testing was planned after the license application to increase confidence and refine
designs. The 1990 report, <em>Rethinking High-level Waste</em>, by the National Academy of Sciences,
stressed that it was unrealistic to assume that all information for resolving all issues could be
available before a repository was constructed. Furthermore, the Congress, through the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act, recognized that information would continue to be evolving through the
construction, operation and potential retrieval periods of a repository. Under the 1994 Program
Plan, we expected to submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in
2001, and start repository operations in 2010.
<p>
In the Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation cycle, the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
funding was reduced by 33 percent from $375 million in Fiscal Year 1995 to $250 million in
Fiscal Year 1996. The Congress recognized that a more constrained repository program would be
required. The Conference Report accompanying the appropriations language provided specific
guidance to refocus the Yucca Mountain Project to: emphasize core scientific activities; complete
excavation of necessary portions of the Exploratory Studies Facility and scientific tests needed to
assess performance of the repository; and complete the repository and waste package conceptual
design. The guidance also provided for the deferral of activities supporting preparation and filing
of a license application for the repository.
<p>
In response to this guidance and the additional policy decisions associated with the development
of the President's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, the strategy for the Yucca Mountain Site
Characterization Project has been revised to identify, prioritize, and schedule a set of site
characterization activities that will allow us to maintain our long-term objective of starting
repository operations in 2010. Based on the knowledge we have gained through scientific
investigations and engineering design activities conducted to date, as well as streamlining and
focusing both technical and regulatory elements of our site characterization program, we have
defined three near-term objectives:  complete an update to our regulatory framework in 1997;
complete a viability assessment in 1998; and recommend the repository site to the President in
2001 and submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002. These
objectives are summarized below.
<p>
<strong>Update the Regulatory Framework for a Repository at Yucca Mountain in 1997</strong><br>

In 1996 we plan to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend our siting guidelines (10
CFR Part 960) to make them specific to the Yucca Mountain site. This revision is in response to
national policy changes as well as the significant increase in our understanding of the Yucca
Mountain site since these guidelines were promulgated in 1984. After completion of the public
comment period, we will publish the final rule in 1997. The Program will also continue to
interact with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as
they promulgate regulations specific to a repository at Yucca Mountain.
<p>
<strong>Complete the Viability Assessment of the Yucca Mountain Site in 1998 </strong><br>

This assessment will consist of repository and waste package designs; an evaluation of the
probable performance of the system of natural and engineered barriers; a plan and cost estimate
to complete the additional technical work needed to prepare a license application; and an
estimate of the costs to construct and operate a repository using these designs. We believe that
these components, taken together, will provide a better understanding of the repository design
and its performance in the geologic setting, a better appreciation of the remaining work needed to
prepare a license application, and a more precise estimate of the cost of a repository. The
completion of these components will constitute a logical convergence point at which we can
make a measurably improved appraisal of the prospects for geologic disposal at the Yucca
Mountain site and provide this information to the Administration and the Congress. 
<p>
To support this objective, we plan to complete excavation of the Exploratory Studies Facility
main tunnel at the potential repository level in 1996. This excavation will allow underground
testing to collect key scientific and engineering data for site characterization and design.
<p>
<strong>Recommend a Repository Site to the President in 2001 and Submit a Repository License
Application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002</strong> <br>

After 1998, we will complete the activities described in a license application plan developed as
part of the viability assessment. A Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be prepared in 1999
and submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for preliminary comments on its
sufficiency for licensing. We will issue the Draft Environmental Impact Statement for public
review and comment in 1999 and issue the Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of
Decision in 2000. If the site is found suitable, the Secretary will issue a site recommendation in
2001. Prior to making a decision on site recommendation, we will announce a schedule for
public hearings in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain on the possible recommendation. After the
hearings and prior to recommending the site to the President, we will notify the State of Nevada
about the decision to recommend the site. If the site is approved, we will submit a license
application for construction authorization to the Commission in 2002.
<p>
The remainder of <em>Section 2.1 </em>further describes our revised Project objectives, the bases for the
revised objectives, key technical activities supporting the revised objectives, key management
activities, project milestones, and funding requirements.

<h4>2.1.1     Revised Project Objectives</h4>
<p>
The three near-term Project objectives are described in more detail below.
<p>
<strong>Updating the Regulatory Framework for a Repository at Yucca Mountain in 1997</strong><br>

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 set forth the requirements from which the repository
Program's current regulatory framework was developed. This regulatory framework has three
key components. The Act required: (1) the Department of Energy to issue general guidelines for
the recommendation of sites for repository development; (2) the Environmental Protection
Agency to promulgate generally applicable standards for protection of the environment; and (3)
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to promulgate technical requirements and criteria to be used
for repository licensing. In response to this Congressional direction, the Department of Energy
issued 10 CFR Part 960, the Environmental Protection Agency issued 40 CFR Part 191, and the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued 10 CFR Part 60. 
<p>
<strong>Rationale for Regulatory Revision</strong><br>

Two significant developments have occurred since the regulatory framework for developing
geologic repositories was established more than a decade ago. At the inception of the Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management Program, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act required the
characterization of several potential repository sites in different geologic media. This policy
changed when the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987 directed the Department to
characterize a single site, Yucca Mountain, Nevada, instead of all three sites being considered at
the time. The regulatory framework discussed above was not based upon criteria relevant to a
specific site, but rather was intended to be applied generically to any potential geologic
repository site. Although it was evident that not every factor included in the Department's siting
guidelines (10 CFR Part 960) would be significant to evaluating the suitability of a particular
site, the scientific and technical understanding of the Yucca Mountain site was not then sufficient
to support revising these guidelines. 
<p>
A second change that impacted the regulatory framework occurred when the 1992 Energy Policy
Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate a site-specific radiation
protection standard for Yucca Mountain. This standard is currently being developed. It will
replace 40 CFR Part 191, which is no longer applicable to Yucca Mountain. The Energy Policy
Act also directed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to revise its licensing regulations (10 CFR
Part 60) to be consistent with the site-specific standard developed by the Environmental
Protection Agency. 
<p>
In addition to these policy developments, the Program has greatly improved its understanding of
the conditions at the Yucca Mountain site. In light of the recent Congressional direction to the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop
site-specific regulations, and the recent significant advances we have made in our understanding
of the site, the Program has decided to clarify and streamline our siting guidelines. The resulting
regulatory framework will provide a more efficient and understandable process for site
evaluation and repository development that more clearly focuses on protecting the health and
safety of the public.
<p>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act recognized that revisions to the siting guidelines might be
necessary and authorized the Secretary to revise them as needed. These guidelines will be
amended through a public rulemaking process that will provide an opportunity for public
participation. The resulting guidelines must be concurred on by the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. The Program will work to ensure that we receive this concurrence by focusing on
safety, consistent with the licensing requirements of the Commission. 
<p>
<strong>Scope of Regulatory Revision</strong><br>

The siting guidelines will be revised to identify the criteria and clarify the process for evaluating
the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site. The amendments will reflect the technical knowledge
gained at Yucca Mountain and the changes made since the guidelines were initially promulgated
in 1984. The proposed revision will add a methodology for applying the siting guidelines specific
to Yucca Mountain.
<p>
We will propose to evaluate the suitability of Yucca Mountain based upon the overall
performance of the repository system during operations and after closure, rather than separately
evaluating individual aspects of the site. An overall system performance approach is the
appropriate method to consider all relevant site features, because it identifies, in an integrated
manner, those attributes of the site and engineered components that are most important to the
protection of health and safety. The information gained from the site investigations and the total
system performance assessments show that the significance of selected site characteristics should
not be judged in isolation from one another or from a specific design concept. For example, a
geologic structural feature that provides a fast pathway for groundwater flow through the
mountain may seem a detriment when considered alone but, when considered in conjunction with
a specific repository design, may act beneficially by channeling flow away from the waste and
thus reducing the potential for groundwater contact with the waste packages. 
<p>
While the proposed rule will identify the criteria and process that will be used by the Program to
evaluate the suitability of Yucca Mountain, the details regarding site characterization activities
and the relationship between the revised testing plans and the 1988 <em>Site Characterization Plan</em>
will continue to be reported through the semiannual <em>Site Characterization Progress Reports</em>, as
required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The relationship between the siting guidelines and
these documents will be described in the rulemaking.
<p>
<strong>Completing the Viability Assessment of the Yucca Mountain Site in 1998<br>
</strong>
The viability assessment will include four components: (1) designs for critical underground
features of the repository and for the waste package; (2) an updated total system performance
assessment; (3) a license application plan; and (4) repository cost and schedule estimate. We
have prioritized and integrated our science, engineering, and management activities to support
completion of these components in 1998.
<p>
After completion of the viability assessment, this same body of work will serve as a foundation
for the Program's evaluation of site suitability, development of an Environmental Impact
Statement, a Secretarial site recommendation to the President, and a license application to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<p>
<strong>Repository and Waste Package Design 
</strong><br>
The first component of the viability assessment will address those design elements that are
critical to determining the feasibility and performance of the repository and the engineered
barrier system. The effort will evaluate the technological feasibility of the designs but will not yet
contain the detail needed for licensing. The designs will build on our existing design work
documented in the 1996 <em>Mined Geologic Disposal System Advanced Conceptual Design Report,</em>
with emphasis placed on the key technical questions that affect waste containment and isolation,
performance, and cost. These questions revolve around thermal management of the
waste-generated heat, corrosion of waste packages, the role of supplemental engineered barriers,
and transport of radioactive wastes. In addition, the effort will address concepts for waste
retrieval operations, performance confirmation requirements, safety systems, and other factors
that significantly affect repository costs.

<h6>A conceptual design of a waste package for spent nuclear fuel. The waste package will consist of multiple metal barriers designed to contain the wastes by resisting corrosion for thousands of years.</h6>
<p>
Scientific and engineering information gained during construction and testing in the Exploratory
Studies Facility, as well as results from surface-based and laboratory testing, will be incorporated
into the designs. Scientific investigations and performance assessment activities will provide data
and requirements for these designs. These designs for the viability assessment will identify the
additional design detail needed to support the license application, and will contribute to the total
system performance assessment.<a href="./fig5.jpg"> <em>Figure 5</a> (on the preceding page) and <a href="./fig6.jpg">Figure 6</a> (on this page)
illustrate our current conceptual design for the waste package and potential repository.</em>

<p>

<strong>Total System Performance Assessment</strong><br>
The second component of the viability assessment will be an updated total system performance
assessment based on our design concepts and the analyses of available site and engineering data.
The primary objective of the total system performance assessment, as described in the box on this
page, is to evaluate the probable behavior of the potential repository. An additional objective is to
further refine our evaluations of repository performance under a range of normal conditions and
under conditions imposed by potentially disruptive events, such as earthquakes and volcanism.
The performance assessment will also evaluate the possible range of performance caused by
uncertainty in predicting key factors such as ground-water flow, thermal effects, and corrosion. 
<hr>
<h5>Total System Performance Assessment <p>
Performance assessment is an analytical technique that uses computer models to evaluate the
ability of the repository site to contain and isolate wastes within the context of applicable safety
standards. This ability will depend on the characteristics of the natural geologic barrier and the
engineered barrier, which includes the waste package and any supplemental man-made barriers.
Mathematical models of the physical processes that affect waste containment and isolation, such
as water flow in the geologic setting, are abstracted, or simplified, and linked to one another in
order to develop an estimate of the overall performance of the repository, referred to as a<em> total
system performance assessment</em>. To evaluate potential radiation exposure to the public from the
waste emplaced in the repository site, performance assessment uses biosphere models. A
biosphere model describes the pathways by which individuals in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain
might receive doses from radionuclides that have been released from a repository. Performance
assessments are iterative, in that the information gained from each effort, together with newly
acquired scientific and engineering information, is used to guide subsequent assessments. The
latest iteration, <em>Total System Performance Assessment - 1995</em>, has provided insights for the
development of this revision to the Program Plan. 
 <p>
The overall philosophy of any total system performance assessment is to evaluate future
repository behavior by using models and parameters that are as representative as current
information allows. In those cases where representative information is not available or is very
uncertain, conservative assumptions must be made. 
<p>
An important objective of performance assessment modeling is to identify the significance of the
current uncertainty in processes, models, and parameters on the system performance. The impact
of the uncertainty is directly evaluated in the assessments themselves by the probabilistic nature
of the analyses. Those components that are most significant and uncertain are identified as
warranting additional investigation. This provides direct input to the site characterization and
design programs to assist in prioritizing the necessary testing to, in turn, develop more robust and
defensible performance assessments. 
<p>
Total system performance assessments evolve with time. As science and design information
matures, performance assessment analyses are revised to become more representative of the
expected conditions. Iterations of total system performance assessments of the Yucca Mountain
site and associated engineered barriers have been conducted in 1991, 1993, and 1995. Activities
supporting <em>Total System Performance Assessment</em>, a key component of the 1998 viability
assessment, are underway.
</h5><hr>
<p>
<strong>License Application Plan </strong><br>

The third component of the viability assessment is the license application plan, which will
identify the remaining scientific investigations and engineering information needed to complete a
license application. Our long-term goal of submitting a docketable license application to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, should the Yucca Mountain site be found suitable, remains
central to the Program's mission. The preparation of the license application plan will also
provide an opportunity to assess the adequacy of our revised approach to site characterization and
design and the effectiveness of updates to the Program's regulatory framework. 
<p>
The license application plan will, in 1997, describe the additional information we believe is
needed to submit a docketable application for repository construction authorization to the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In developing the plan, we will draw on the available models
and data that describe the natural system, the repository and waste package designs, and the total
system performance assessment, together with the strategy for evaluating waste containment and
isolation. The plan will describe additional tests that will support the safety analysis for a
repository design and which will be completed before submittal of the license application. It will
also describe the performance confirmation program that will continue during repository
construction and operation, to further reduce the uncertainties in predicting the long-term
performance of the repository. The plan will also include a cost estimate for completing the
activities needed to prepare the license application.
<p>
<strong>Repository Cost and Schedule Estimates </strong><br>

The cost and schedule estimates for the repository system, the fourth component of the viability
assessment, will address completion of site characterization; performance confirmation; and
construction, operation, and closure of a potential repository at Yucca Mountain. The life-cycle
cost and schedule estimates will provide information for policy decisions regarding the feasibility
and rationale for continuing with licensing and construction of a geologic repository. 
The cost estimates will be based on the repository and waste package designs, and scientific
testing completed in 1998. We will use some design assumptions to augment the completed
designs. To reduce the uncertainties inherent in such assumptions, design activities will place an
emphasis on defining repository and engineered barrier system concepts and components that
significantly affect costs. 
<p>
<strong>Recommending a Repository Site to the President in 2001 and Submitting a Repository License
Application to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002
</strong><br>
If the site is suitable, we will proceed with issuing the statutorily required Environmental Impact
Statement and Secretarial recommendation to the President in 2001. If the site is approved, we
plan to submit a license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2002.
<p>
<strong>Environmental Impact Statement </strong><br>
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires that a Final Environmental Impact Statement accompany
the Secretarial site recommendation and the license application. We began the Environmental
Impact Statement process by publishing a Notice of Intent in the <em>Federal Register</em>, which initiated
the public comment period on the proposed scope of the Environmental Impact Statement. As
part of the scoping effort, we conducted 15 public meetings across the nation. The public
comment period closed on December 5, 1995.
<p>
Because of the reduced funding in Fiscal Year 1996, we deferred further action on the
Environmental Impact Statement until Fiscal Year 1997. The Project schedule now calls for
publishing the Draft Environmental Impact Statement in 1999, and a Final Environmental Impact
Statement in 2000.
<p>
<strong>Site Recommendation </strong><br>
If the site is determined to be suitable with respect to the revised siting guidelines, a decision by
the Secretary of Energy to recommend the site is expected in 2001. We will publish a Notice of
Consideration to inform the public and announce a schedule for public hearings in the vicinity of
Yucca Mountain on the possible recommendation. After the hearings and prior to recommending
the site to the President, we will notify the State of Nevada about the decision to recommend the
site. The basis for this decision will include: (1) a description of the proposed repository,
including preliminary engineering specifications; (2) a description of the waste form or
packaging and an explanation of the relationship between the geologic environment and the
waste packages and waste forms; (3) a discussion of data obtained during site characterization
relating to the safety of the site; (4) the final Environmental Impact Statement; and (5)
preliminary comments by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission concerning the sufficiency of site
characterization. The site recommendation will also include the views and comments of the
Governor and State legislature, as well as other information the Secretary considers appropriate,
and any impact report submitted by the State of Nevada.
<p>
A Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be completed in 1999. This document will be
provided to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for preliminary comments on its sufficiency for
licensing. Section 114 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission's comments to address the extent to which at-depth site characterization analysis
and the waste form proposal seem to be sufficient for inclusion in a license application. 
<p>
<strong>License Application </strong><br>

To ensure that our activities prior to the viability assessment are consistent with our objective of
submitting a repository license application in 2002, we will continue interacting with the
Commission to receive feedback on the regulatory applicability and sufficiency of our work. We
will also continue to publish the semi-annual<em> Site Characterization Progress Reports</em>, as one
means of informing the Commission, and others, of our progress.
<p>
After completion of the viability assessment, we will prepare the additional information required
for the license application, such as an emergency response plan and a description of the quality
assurance program. A detailed description of our planned performance confirmation testing
program will also be prepared. The Project Integrated Safety Assessment will be used to develop
the license application. This additional information will result in a repository license application
that meets Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements. 
<p>
In 1999, we will acquire a computer-based Licensing Support System designed to meet the
requirements of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Licensing Support System Administrator
and to facilitate an efficient licensing review. The system will allow access to the comprehensive
documentation required for the licensing proceedings and will be certified by the Commission at
least six months before a license application is submitted.
<p>
<h4>2.1.2     Bases for the Revised Project Objectives</h4>
<p>
Progress in site characterization is enabling the Project to streamline and focus both technical and
regulatory elements of our plan to conduct site characterization. This progress is also a basis for
updating our strategy for evaluating waste containment and isolation. This section gives
examples of technical progress and discusses the updated strategy. <em>The box on the following
page outlines steps the Project has taken or will be taking to streamline and focus both technical
and regulatory elements.</em>
<p>
<strong>Progress in Characterizing the Yucca Mountain Site</strong><br>

Our progress in characterizing the Yucca Mountain site covers three areas: scientific programs,
construction and operation of the Exploratory Studies Facility, and engineering design.
<p>
<strong>Scientific Programs</strong><br>

Recent progress in the site characterization program has resulted in completion or near
completion of some investigations and increased confidence in the adequacy and significance of
other investigations. In the areas of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport, our models
have been made significantly more robust than earlier versions through the incorporation of new
data. In the area of geologic hazards, our work to bound the estimate of volcanic hazards is nearly
complete, and the field-based portion of seismic hazards investigations is also reaching
completion. These and other areas of progress are discussed below.
<p>
<em>Groundwater flow in the unsaturated zone</em>. Using isotopes such as carbon-14, tritium,
uranium-series, and chlorine-36, fracture-fill materials and pore water samples collected in the
Exploratory Studies Facility and from boreholes are being dated. This age dating is providing
data on water residence times and the times of past water movement through preferential
flowpaths. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the residence times of pore water
currently in the potential repository horizon are generally long, on the order of tens of thousands
to hundreds of thousands of years.
<p>
The pneumatic monitoring program has improved our understanding of air flow through the
mountain and is providing data for calibrating the unsaturated zone flow model. The effects of
faults and stratigraphic contacts on air flow are being monitored and characterized. These data
are being compiled and used to calibrate the unsaturated zone flow model to match pressure
responses and constrain the bulk properties of major hydrologic units for controlling air flow.
Data collection by scientists working for Nye County, Nevada has provided important input to
this effort.
<p>
The unsaturated zone flow model has also been improved by advances in our understanding of
pore-scale processes in natural fractures, effective hydraulic conductivities of fracture networks,
and hysteresis of moisture-tension relations. These advances give us additional confidence in
modeling groundwater flow in fractures. Observations of moisture distributions, including
perched water occurrences, have been used to calibrate the unsaturated zone flow model. Zeolitic
zones in the Calico Hills geologic unit appear to control perched water occurrences along the
interface between the Calico Hills and Topopah Spring geologic units. This increase in our
understanding has led to a numerical flow model that credibly represents much of the hydrologic
data collected to date and is being used to focus additional work. 

<hr>
<h5>Streamlining and Focusing Technical and Regulatory Elements <p>
In response to Congressional direction and our progress in site characterization, we have revised
both the technical and regulatory elements of our strategy for completing site characterization,
determining the suitability of the Yucca Mountain site for a geologic repository, and preparing
and submitting a license application for construction authorization to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission. Ways in which the technical and regulatory elements have been both streamlined
and focused are discussed below. 
<p>
Streamlining Technical Elements <br>
<ul>
<li>     Efficiencies and operating experience gained by actual tunnel boring machine  operations
have allowed us to accelerate Exploratory Studies Facility excavation. 
<li>     We have tied revisions of our site process models to key decision points, thereby reducing
the number of iterations and reports. 
<li>Instead of large, formal design reports for the repository and waste package, we will control and 
release elements of these designs as they progress. 
</ul><p>
Focusing Technical Elements <br>
<ul>
<li>We plan to emphasize data synthesis and documentation of what we have learned to date, in
order to conduct a smaller, more focused site data collection program. 
<li>We plan to focus documentation of our progress in integrated, rather than element- specific
reports, including total system performance assessment reports, peer reviews of our performance
assessment models, and a Project Integrated Safety Assessment. 
<li>We have developed a strategy to help us focus on early evaluation of those parts of the natural
barriers and engineering design that our performance assessment models tell us are most
significant to predicting waste containment and isolation in a  potential repository. 
</ul><p>
Streamlining Regulatory Elements <br>
<ul>
<li>We have reduced the number of times we plan to revise the license application annotated outline
and submit it to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for review. 
<li>We have reduced the number of topical reports we plan to prepare and submit to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission for review. 
</ul><p>
Focusing Regulatory Elements <br>
<ul>
<li>We have focused our meetings with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on areas where we can
make progress in resolving issues.
<li>We plan to use the authority granted by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to revise the Department's 
siting guidelines (10 CFR Part 960). The revision will clarify our approach to evaluating the
suitability of the Yucca Mountain site. This approach will focus on the overall safety of the
repository system during operations and after  closure.
</ul></h5>

<p>
<em>Radionuclide transport in the unsaturated zone.</em> Results from the unsaturated zone transport
model completed in Fiscal Year 1995 suggest that sorption and matrix diffusion may be effective
site-scale retardation mechanisms. Laboratory and modeling studies are providing a more robust
characterization of potential radionuclide transport at the site. Recent advances have allowed us
to reduce the number of radionuclides to a few key ones that are being studied in detail to
evaluate post-closure site performance. 
<p>
<em>Groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the saturated zone.</em> Testing has been initiated at
the C-Hole complex to help characterize flow and transport in the saturated zone. Analysis of
transient pressure data from pumping tests has yielded local flow properties for the saturated
zone. Analysis of tracer breakthrough has provided an estimate of longitudinal dispersivity.
These data have been supplemented with hydraulic and geochemical data from aquifer tests from
other boreholes to support development of a repository-scale model of flow in the saturated zone. 
<p>
<em>Thermal effects.</em> A peer review team of independent scientists was organized to review the <em>in situ</em>
testing program that is planned to improve our understanding of coupled
thermal-hydrologic-chemical-mechanical processes. The peer review team is nearing completion
of its task. Based on the thermal-hydrologic-chemical-mechanical laboratory tests that we have
completed, and the peer review team recommendations, we have focused our plans for heater
tests that will be used to validate our current site-scale process models. 
<p>
<em>Volcanic hazards.</em> During the past two years, the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project
conducted an expert elicitation for a probabilistic volcanic hazard analysis. This was an
assessment, from a panel of expert earth scientists, of the probability of a volcanic event
disrupting the potential repository at Yucca Mountain. Additionally, the panel was asked to
quantify the uncertainties associated with their assessment. 
<p>
The probabilistic volcanic hazard analysis included four workshops and two field trips that
provided an opportunity for technical discussions and interactions, to ensure the panel had a
common understanding of the issues to be addressed. The panel was supplied with relevant data
gathered by the Project, as well as by the State of Nevada and by the Center for Nuclear Waste
Regulatory Analyses.
<p>
The final expert elicitation workshop was held during December 1995. While a wide variety of
approaches were used by the expert panel members, the panel's mean probability estimate of a
future volcanic event directly intersecting the repository was approximately 2.0 x10-8 events per
year, or about a 1 in 50,000,000 chance per year. The expert panel's estimate of probability is
virtually identical to that produced by Project scientists, suggesting that the volcanic hazard is
now well bounded by a wide range of scientific interpretations that yield reasonably consistent
and defensible results. 
<p>
<em>Seismic hazards. </em>Fieldwork to support the seismic hazards investigation is now reaching
completion. This work includes surface geologic mapping and construction of trenches across
potentially active faults to help estimate the magnitudes and recurrence intervals for earthquakes.
Data from these surface studies will be integrated with geophysical information to construct an
updated 3-D geologic framework model that will provide added confidence to our estimates of
seismic hazards. A probabilistic seismic hazard analysis, which will be conducted in Fiscal Year
1997, will be used to complete the evaluation of the potential hazard to the site from seismic
activity and to produce seismic design parameters for facilities to be constructed at Yucca
Mountain. 
<p>
To confirm our estimates of seismic hazards, the Project will continue to monitor seismic activity
in the Yucca Mountain area. Fifteen new digital seismic stations have been added to the Southern
Great Basin Seismic Network. These new stations are proving to be considerably more sensitive
than the older analog recording stations. The new stations allow us to record seismic events that
are well below the threshold for potential damage. Analysis of these small events increases our
understanding of the earthquake potential of the region.
<p>
<strong>Exploratory Studies Facility Construction and Operation</strong><br>
We have made significant progress in constructing the Exploratory Studies Facility. This
progress has permitted our scientists and engineers to begin direct observation and testing of
subsurface geologic and hydrologic conditions and of the engineering properties of the rock and
its response to construction activities. 
<p>
The north ramp starter tunnel was constructed with conventional (drill and blast) techniques and
was completed in September 1993. The remainder of the Exploratory Studies Facility has been
excavated using a tunnel boring machine. Four alcoves have been constructed in the north ramp
of the Exploratory Studies Facility, as described in <a href="./fig7.jpg"><em>Figure 7</em></a>, above. Excavation of the Upper
Tiva Canyon alcove (Alcove 1) was completed in December 1993. Excavation of the Bow Ridge
Fault alcove (Alcove 2) was completed in August 1995. Excavation of the Upper Paintbrush Tuff
Contact alcove (Alcove 3) was completed in August 1995. Excavation of Lower Paintbrush Tuff
Contact alcove (Alcove 4) was completed in October 1995. These alcoves have allowed the
scientific testing to proceed in the general area where waste would be emplaced in a potential
repository. A thermal testing alcove is under construction off the main Exploratory Studies
Facility tunnel. Excavation of that alcove will proceed far enough to place a single heater test in
1996. The remainder of the alcove will be constructed in 1997 for the much larger drift-scale
heater test. Two additional alcoves, called the north Ghost Dance fault and south Ghost Dance
fault alcoves, will be constructed off the Exploratory Studies Facility main tunnel to allow<em> in situ</em>
testing near the Ghost Dance fault. Both Ghost Dance fault alcoves are planned to be completed
in 1997, and the resulting testing results used to support the 1998 viability assessment. 
<p>
We are now more than half-way through the five-mile underground loop. We plan to complete
excavation of the south ramp back to the surface to finish the Exploratory Studies Facility
U-shaped, five-mile underground loop in 1997.

<h6>Design of the Exploratory Studies Facility. The Exploratory Studies Facility is providing scientists and engineers with the ability to observe underground geologic features that might affect repository and waste package design or repository performance. It is currently under construction, with progress well ahead of schedule. The completed facility will be a five-mile, U-shaped underground loop, 7.6 meters (25 feet) in diameter.</h6>
<p>
<strong>Engineering Design</strong><br>
The 1988 <em>Site Characterization Plan Conceptual Design Report</em> has served as the reference
design for the repository and waste package. The 1996 <em>Mined Geologic Disposal System
Advanced Conceptual Design Report</em> documents the current level of detail for the repository and
waste package. This report provides us with a new design, or a benchmark, based on the work
performed to date. The report describes the design process, depicts the major repository and
waste package configurations, components, and operational concepts, and identifies those areas
of the design requiring further refinement. Some significant changes from the 1988 <em>Conceptual
Design Report</em> include thermal loading and emplacement mode in the repository and the size,
capacity, and materials for the waste package. This new design report will serve as the initial
basis for the viability assessment design.
<p>
Information on design and performance parameters in this report were integrated with the
scientific investigations, systems engineering, and performance assessment elements. Particular
emphasis was placed on waste package handling and nuclear shielding requirements for worker
safety. 
<p>
<strong>Updating the Strategy for Evaluating Waste Containment and Isolation </strong>
<p>
<strong>Rationale for an Updated Strategy</strong><br>
The Project is in the process of updating its strategy for evaluating waste containment and
isolation for the Yucca Mountain site. The original strategy was described in the 1988 <em>Site
Characterization Plan</em>. Since that time, much has been learned about the site, as discussed above.
What has been learned leaves a relatively few, but important, technical questions about
significant features and processes of the natural geologic and hydrologic system that influence
the functioning of the engineered systems (especially the waste package) that would be part of a
potential Yucca Mountain repository. <em>The Program's strategy for evaluating the containment and
isolation of radioactive wastes at Yucca Mountain is described in the box on the following page.</em>
<p>
Progress in characterizing the Yucca Mountain site is occurring in parallel with progress in
defining the design of the engineered system. As engineered system concepts mature, testing of
selected materials under conditions that either mimic or bound expected conditions can also
become more focused. 
<p>
Finally, the 1992 Energy Policy Act directed the Environmental Protection Agency to promulgate
a site-specific radiation protection standard for Yucca Mountain. This standard is currently being
developed and early indications are that it will be a health-based standard, likely requiring dose
calculations to a critical group. To address this type of standard, modeling of the saturated zone
and the biosphere needs to be enhanced over the types of models we have used to address the
previously applicable release based standard.
<p>
Three developments have contributed to the need to update the strategy for evaluating waste
containment and isolation: (1) new site characterization information; (2) updated repository and
waste package conceptual designs; and (3) considerations related to the change from a release
standard to a dose or risk-based standard, with an as yet unspecified regulatory time frame.
<p>
<hr>
<h5>Strategy for Evaluating Waste Containment and Isolation For The Yucca Mountain Site<p>
The Program's strategy for evaluating the containment and isolation of radioactive wastes relies
on engineered barriers, geologic features, and natural processes to delay and minimize releases of
radionuclides to the environment outside of the Yucca Mountain site and to minimize any
exposure to the public. The strategy is based on the observation that there is very little available
water in the rocks in and around the repository to dissolve radionuclides and transport them to
the accessible environment.
<p>
<em>Engineered Barriers. </em>Waste arriving at the repository site will be placed in a special disposal
container, or waste package, consisting of multiple metal barriers designed to contain the wastes
by resisting corrosion for thousands of years. A backfill of crushed rock around the waste
packages, an example of another engineered barrier, is being evaluated with the intent that it may
be used to limit water contact with the packages, further delaying corrosion and, following
corrosion, to limit dissolution and transport of radionuclides. The heat output of the waste will
dry the rock, decreasing relative humidity and thus delaying corrosion of the disposal packages,
while the major portion of hazardous radionuclides decay to background levels.
<p>
<em>Geologic Features and Natural Processes. </em>The repository's long-term behavior, following
corrosion of the waste packages and transport of radionuclides from the engineered barrier, will
be controlled by geologic features and natural processes. Water movement through the repository
level, which could lead to dissolution and transport of radionuclides, is the most important
feature for determining the long-term behavior of the potential repository. Based on observations
of generally dry conditions in the Exploratory Studies Facility and preliminary analyses of age
dates of water from the rock pores at the potential repository level and of mineral coatings
deposited by water flowing along fractures, we believe today's dry conditions are likely to persist
in the future. Mathematical models developed to characterize gas and fluid flow at Yucca
Mountain predict that water movement will continue to be slow in the future even with potential
changes in climatic and hydrologic conditions. Some of the radionuclides that are released from
corroded waste packages will be delayed as they move through the rocks below the repository
horizon. Radionuclides that reach the water table will mix with flowing groundwater and be
diluted.
<p>
<em>Doses to the Public. </em>We have defined isolation with a system-level safety goal as "an acceptable
dose to a member of the public living near the site." The project will report quantitative dose
modeling results. More attention will be paid to evaluating potential doses for the first ten
thousand years. However, evaluations will, qualitatively, be carried out over longer times in order
to provide insight into peak dose potential and to support system enhancement studies.
</h5><hr>
<p>
<strong>Concepts and Status of the Updated Strategy</strong><br>
The Project's updated strategy for waste containment and isolation for a potential repository at
the Yucca Mountain site will maintain the core strategy of the 1988 <em>Site Characterization Plan</em>:
the Yucca Mountain site, at potential repository depth, is approximately 1000 feet above the
water table and experiences very low rates of water infiltration from the surface. This site
characteristic is the first line of defense against the corrosion of waste packages and the release of
radionuclides from breached waste packages in the potential repository (leading to loss of
containment). Secondary lines of defense to enhance containment and isolation lie in potential
engineered barriers adjacent to the waste package and in the geochemical environment provided
by the natural system, which suggests considerable sorption will exist along potential flow paths
for many radionuclide species that could eventually be released from the waste package.
The updated strategy currently being developed maintains a number of fundamentals of the
original strategy. The updated strategy continues to recognize the important role of the relatively
"dry" conditions at Yucca Mountain, which contributed to the site originally being selected for
characterization studies. The updated strategy also continues to recognize the geochemical setting
provided by Yucca Mountain as important to determining the rate at which radionuclides may be
released into the environment in the future, when containment by the engineered barriers is
eventually lost.
<p>
However, this update differs from the original strategy for four reasons. First, because much has
been learned since 1988, there is an opportunity to focus resources on the remaining technical
questions that have been demonstrated, through total system performance assessments, to be
important to waste containment and isolation. Second, to make an evaluation of the viability of
committing further resources to the licensing process for Yucca Mountain, there is a need to
make this appraisal independent of evolving specific regulations. Third, the strategy update
incorporates an enhanced engineered system design that more effectively complements important
features of the natural system. Finally, the updated strategy reflects the revised schedule and
recognizes the need for a sufficient technical basis to support the viability assessment in 1998
and the license application in 2002. 
<p>
In order to support the societal decision that needs to be made on geologic disposal, the Project is
defining waste containment and isolation for purposes of conducting the viability assessment. We
have defined waste containment as the "near-complete containment of radionuclides by waste
packages for several thousands of years." We have defined isolation with a system-level safety
goal as "an acceptable dose to a member of the public living near the site." Quantitative dose
modeling results will be reported by the Project. More attention will be paid to evaluating
potential doses for the first ten thousand years. However, evaluations will qualitatively be carried
out over longer times in order to provide insight into peak dose potential and to support system
enhancement studies.
<p>
The technical questions identified in recent total system performance assessments as key to
evaluating repository and waste package performance are related to the following key attributes
of the system:
<p>
1.   rate of water seepage into the repository;<br>
2.   integrity of waste packages (containment);<br>
3.   rate of release of radionuclides from waste in the breached waste packages;<br>
4.   radionuclide transport through engineered barriers and natural barriers; and<br>
5.   dilution in the groundwater below the repository.<br>
<p>
The strategy will include more detail as to what we now understand about these five attributes, as
well as what our approach is to gathering data and developing models to make better predictions
of these attributes over time. As the repository generates heat and then gradually returns to
ambient temperatures, it is expected that at least the first four of these attributes will be affected,
changing their relative importance to system performance as a function of time.
<p>
The strategy will guide our plans for a viability assessment in 1998, but also looks forward to and
beyond the license application. We will continue to conduct scientific and engineering studies to
aid us in confirming or revising the basis for modeling performance of the repository system.
This Program Plan indicates our expectation to have more information available for a license
application. It also recognizes that, if a license is granted, confirmatory technical work will
continue beyond the license application during the construction and operational phases of the
repository.
<p>
<h4>2.1.3     Key Technical Activities Supporting the Revised Project Objectives</h4>
<p>
To support the work for the viability assessment and continuing through license application, we
are concentrating our activities into four integrated areas: (1) core science; (2) Exploratory
Studies Facility construction and operation; (3) engineering design; and (4) performance
assessment.
<p>
In addition to these four areas, environmental activities are ongoing. The Project will continue to
comply with all applicable statutes and regulations. For example, the Project operates under
several permits that are designed to protect natural and cultural resources and complies with air
quality permits, water quality permits, and other such permits issued by the State of Nevada. 
<p>
National Environmental Policy Act compliance activities will be resumed in Fiscal Year 1997
with the award of a contract for preparation of the Environmental Impact Statement. These
activities include reviewing and responding to public scoping comments and data gathering and
impact analyses. These activities will lead to development and issuance of a Draft Environmental
Impact Statement, followed by a public hearing period and a Final Environmental Impact
Statement, and a Record of Decision.
<p>
<strong>Core Science Activities </strong><br>
Scientific testing will continue to support model development, design, performance assessment,
and performance confirmation.<em> In situ </em>testing in the Exploratory Studies Facility and related
laboratory tests will be emphasized. Crucial initial results from Exploratory Studies Facility
testing will be available for incorporation into process models being developed in support of the
total system performance assessment for viability assessment. 
<p>
A principal near-term objective of the core science program is to complete the hydrologic flow
and radionuclide transport models that will support the performance assessment calculations for
the viability assessment. The Project will analyze and synthesize the existing data gathered over
the past decade to confirm or modify the conceptual and mathematical models that are used to
support performance assessment calculations. This effort will help narrow the probable range of
effects on repository performance from such key factors as water infiltration through the
repository, release and transport of radionuclides from the waste package to the saturated zone,
dilution of any radionuclide releases, and the degree of drying in the repository from
waste-generated heat.
<p>
The core science program will also identify which data sets or modeling efforts are sufficiently
complete to support a future license application and areas where additional information is
needed. This work will serve as a basis to delineate the testing and performance confirmation
programs to be described in the license application plan.
<p>
We will complete four major types of models in Fiscal Year 1997 to a level of sufficient maturity
to support a comprehensive site description, which will include geologic, hydrologic,
geochemical, and climatological processes, and to support the total system performance
assessment for the viability assessment. We will confirm the sufficiency of these models for
license application with the additional data that will be available in Fiscal Year 1999. Site-scale
flow models will describe groundwater flow above and below the water table. These models will
characterize the movement of gas and fluid through Yucca Mountain and will be used to predict
their future behavior. Site-scale and regional-scale transport models will evaluate potential
radionuclide releases to the accessible environment. The transport models use the results of the
flow models and add the chemical interactions between the rock units below the repository
horizon and potential radionuclide releases. The geologic framework model will present the
distribution of rock units and geologic structures, such as faults, at the site. This basic geologic
information is the foundation for the hydrologic flow and transport models. Climate models will
evaluate potential future climate changes. We will use the results of these modeling efforts to
prescribe bounding values of precipitation for the flow models. 
<p>
The core science activities that will support completion of these four types of models include:
<p>
<ul>
<li><em>Testing and modeling groundwater flow above the water table</em>, to understand the
hydrology in the unsaturated zone where the potential repository horizon is located. The testing
activities in the unsaturated zone are directed primarily at evaluating the amounts and rates of
water moving through the rocks in and around the potential repository and at measuring
hydrologic parameters required to develop and calibrate the numerical flow models of vapor and
fluid flow. Continued monitoring of gas pressure, temperature, and water pressure in
surface-based boreholes will provide some of these hydrologic parameters. Testing in boreholes
drilled in alcoves in the Exploratory Studies Facility will continue to provide pneumatic and
hydrologic data on the effects of faults and boundaries between different rock units on water
movement within the unsaturated zone. The hydrologic testing in the Ghost Dance fault alcoves
will begin in Fiscal Year 1997 and end in Fiscal Year 1999. We will continue to use several
different techniques of isotopic dating of water samples collected from rocks in the Exploratory
Studies Facility to evaluate the length of time that the water has resided in the rock. Isotopic
dating techniques will also continue to be used on loose material in faults to determine the past
history of water movement through potential flowpaths along faults. 
<p>
<li>  <em> Testing and modeling groundwater flow below the water table</em>, to understand the
hydrology in the saturated zone. Testing in the saturated zone is focused on determining the
capability of the groundwater flow system to dilute and disperse dissolved radionuclides and to
provide hydrologic data for input to flow models for the saturated zone. Hydraulic and tracer
testing will continue at a complex of three test wells east of the Yucca Mountain site, and
hydraulic testing is being conducted in a well north of the site to collect hydrologic flow data. 
<p>
<li><em>Radionuclide transport modeling,</em> to integrate what is known about the flow of water, the
effects of waste-generated heat, and the geology of Yucca Mountain with laboratory
measurements of geochemical processes. Laboratory work, hydrologic model development, and
field work to support the development of this modeling have been progressing for some time. To
complement the integrated three-dimensional model for unsaturated zone transport at Yucca
Mountain that we produced in Fiscal Year 1995, we will develop the first model for saturated
zone transport in Fiscal Year 1996. In addition, we are updating the unsaturated zone transport
model to incorporate better defined radionuclide source terms, to incorporate a better calibrated
flow model, to consider additional types of radionuclides, and to include additional physical
processes that affect transport. Laboratory studies are underway to support the modeling and
provide additional confidence in performance assessments. These studies have been prioritized to
maximize our efforts on processes that are most important to waste isolation. In Fiscal Year
1997, we will conduct a limited number of field and laboratory studies and converge on robust
transport models to support performance assessment.
<p>
<li><em> Bounding the radionuclide release rates,</em> to determine defensible values for releases of
different radionuclides as a function of time from the waste packages and other components of
the engineered barrier system. This work involves laboratory experiments, observations and tests
in the Exploratory Studies Facility, and modeling to assess the effects of the thermal pulse from
waste-generated heat on the chemical interaction of introduced materials, such as grout or
backfill, with ground water and rock on transport of radionuclides. Of particular interest for
corrosion and radionuclide transport processes is the temporal and spatial distribution of water
contacting the waste packages and the humidity of the surrounding air. We will obtain
experimental data on these attributes for the rocks at Yucca Mountain to provide realistic
constraints on the models used to predict performance during the time there is high heat output
from the emplaced waste as well as afterwards. Thermal testing in the Exploratory Studies
Facility is one part of this effort. In Fiscal Year 1997, we will develop repository-scale models
based on available laboratory data and initial thermal test results. Laboratory experiments will be
substantially completed in Fiscal Year 1998. These data and results from  in situ thermal tests
will be used to update the repository-scale models to support the license application.
<p>
<li><em>Geologic investigations and synthesis, </em>to complete the description of the geologic
framework and an assessment of volcanic and seismic hazards for Yucca Mountain. In Fiscal
Year 1996, surface-based geologic mapping of the repository block will be completed and
fracture data from surface and underground mapping will be synthesized, and we will update the
preliminary three-dimensional geologic framework model. In Fiscal Year 1997, we will complete
the three-dimensional geologic model for Yucca Mountain with associated information on the
distribution of rock properties, mineral occurrences, and results from geophysical surveys of
subsurface features. We will also complete an assessment of potential natural resources in the
vicinity of Yucca Mountain. Assessments of volcanic and seismic hazards will be completed in
Fiscal Year 1996 and Fiscal Year 1998, respectively. Geological mapping of the Exploratory
Studies Facility will continue as excavation progresses. Surface geologic maps will be
completed.
<p>
<li> <em>Surface-based drilling activities, </em>which are used to obtain subsurface data both within and
outside of the repository area. In Fiscal Year 1996, we completed drilling one additional borehole
to complement the existing suite of approximately 40 boreholes drilled since 1992, when our
quality assurance program was approved, and another 40 boreholes drilled earlier. In addition to
providing rock and water samples, drilling activities allow data collection and analysis of air flow
through Yucca Mountain. Installation of pneumatic instrumentation into three boreholes in Fiscal
Year 1996, together with data from instrumentation already installed in four boreholes during
Fiscal Year 1995, will support models of air flow to predict the behavior of water vapor and
gaseous radionuclides in response to heat from the emplaced wastes. Future activities will focus
on data needed to improve our understanding of the saturated zone flow system.
<p>
<li><em>Climate modeling,</em> to predict future climate conditions in the Yucca Mountain region for
evaluating possible future rates of water infiltration into the unsaturated zone and of recharge to
the regional ground water system. The climate model predictions for a number of possible future
climate scenarios will be developed in Fiscal Year 1997, and used by the flow and transport
models producing a range of infiltration and recharge values to assess the effects of possible
future climatic extremes on waste containment and isolation. 
<p>
<li> <em>   Thermal testing,</em> to examine the effects of the introduction of heat generated by
radioactive decay in the wastes, which should evaporate a large amount of water from the rocks
around the repository level at Yucca Mountain. The role of this water, if it condenses, is a major
uncertainty in assessing repository performance, and a series of experiments will be conducted to
help determine the effects of the water vapor and any condensed water. In addition to evaporation
and condensation, geochemical and geomechanical processes may also have long-term effects on
the amount and composition of water entering and leaving the rocks near the waste package.
Experiments will be performed in the Exploratory Studies Facility, beginning in Fiscal Year
1996, to help bound the effects of the thermal pulse. Measurements will include temperature,
relative humidity, gas pressure, water chemistry, moisture content, and other appropriate
variables to determine the thermal, hydrological, geochemical, and geomechanical responses of
the tunnel and surrounding rocks, representative backfill materials, and potential waste package
materials, to heating and cooling over a temperature range likely to be encountered during the life
cycle of a repository. Confirmation of near-field environment models is necessary for engineered
materials selection, repository design, estimation of waste package failure rates, and
determination of the possible radionuclide releases for performance assessment calculations. The
results from the thermal testing will be used to support completion of the near-field environment
models in Fiscal Year 1998, and will be used in Fiscal Year 2000 to confirm their sufficiency for
license application.
</ul>
<p>
We will continue other monitoring activities in order to obtain the baseline data required for
licensing. These activities include operation of a seismic network to locate and characterize
earthquakes, pneumatic and water-level monitoring in selected boreholes, meteorologic and
surface water flow measurements, and construction monitoring in the Exploratory Studies
Facility. We will analyze data from these activities for significant anomalies and enter them in
technical data bases, where they will be available for use in design activities. Monitoring
activities and data collection to support environmental compliance are also continuing and will
be integrated with data needs for core science and performance assessment.
<p>
The Project also conducts scientific and engineering reviews of hazardous and solid waste
handling and Exploratory Studies Facility designs to ensure compliance with environmental
regulations and requirements. Additionally, the Project gathers data and reports on ambient air
monitoring data and preconstruction surveys to identify and characterize biological and cultural
resources. Finally, the Project prepares data synthesis reports for radiological and terrestrial
ecosystems field monitoring.
<p>
After completion of the viability assessment, we will continue long-term testing and monitoring
activities to confirm performance estimates for both the natural system and the engineered barrier
system. Of particular interest is waste package material corrosion behavior as well as that of the
waste form itself. <em>In situ</em> thermal testing will continue in the Exploratory Studies Facility with the
long heat-up and cool-down times required to properly simulate expected waste package
behavior. Environmental monitoring will continue to support final radiological safety
assessments for the period of operations as well as other requirements of the Environmental
Impact Statement.
<p>
<strong>Exploratory Studies Facility Construction and Operation Activities</strong><br>
The Project will continue construction of the Exploratory Studies Facility using the tunnel boring
machine. In Fiscal Year 1996, we plan to complete excavation of the main drift portion of the
Exploratory Studies Facility at the repository level, which will allow observation and testing of
the geology and hydrology along the north-south length of the potential repository. We initiated
excavation of two alcoves in Fiscal Year 1996. One will be used for conducting thermal tests to
study the response of the groundwater and rocks to heat that will be generated by the wastes. A
single heater test in the initial part of this alcove is scheduled to begin in Fiscal Year 1996 and
end in Fiscal Year 1998. The much larger drift scale heater test in the back part of this alcove
will be started in Fiscal Year 1997, with heat-up to be complete in Fiscal Year 1999. The other
new alcove will provide access near the Ghost Dance fault to study its hydrologic characteristics
and to determine if this fault acts as a preferential path of water flow through the repository. 
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1997, we will complete excavation of the south ramp back to the surface. This will
complete the U-shaped, five-mile underground loop. We will complete excavation of the first
(north) Ghost Dance fault alcove through the fault and also construct a second alcove through the
Ghost Dance fault at the south end of the repository area. Exploratory Studies Facility activities
will continue, including maintenance of the ground support systems and operation and
maintenance of support utilities. If deemed necessary, we will excavate an east-west drift, off the
main tunnel, to allow observation and testing across the width of the proposed repository. This
access (the exact location is not yet determined) could provide additional confirmation that site
conditions are suitable and that the emplacement tunnel layout and ground support concepts are
feasible. If this work is determined to be needed, we plan to start excavation in Fiscal Year 1999,
or earlier, if funding permits.
<p>
The Project continues to ensure the protection of employees, members of the public, the
environment, and site facilities and equipment from hazards that may result from site
characterization and construction activities. The Project also provides underground safety support
and on-site safety support to construction; provides environmental support for operating
hazardous waste accumulation facilities and managing hydrocarbon contaminated soil
maintenance and disposal; and conducts surveillance of site activities to ensure compliance with
environmental regulations and requirements. Additionally, the Project maintains medical
emergency services and fire prevention programs to support field activities, continued
implementation of the safety and health program, and the emergency management program.
<p>
<strong>Engineering Design Activities </strong><br>
The design of the repository will be heavily dependent upon and closely integrated with
performance assessment and core science activities. Coordination with performance assessment
is needed to determine the adequacy of designs, performance margins for safety and isolation,
and to make necessary design modifications. Coordination with core science activities will
ensure the availability of adequate site data to support the designs. Design will also depend on
the results of materials and waste form corrosion and performance testing.
<p>
In Fiscal Year 1996, we documented the advanced conceptual designs for the repository and
waste package in the <em>Mined Geologic Disposal System Advanced Conceptual Design Report</em>.
The report describes the design process, depicts the major repository and waste package
configurations, components, and operational concepts, and identifies those areas of the design
requiring further refinement. The design in this report will serve as the initial basis for the
viability assessment design. 
<p>
For the repository above-ground area, the design for the viability assessment and the cost
estimate will include a description of the site area and the major surface facilities, including the
waste handling building. For the subsurface area, the design will describe the subsurface region,
layout and stability considerations for tunnels, ventilation, concepts for possible retrieval of
wastes, and other operational considerations. The subsurface design will provide an estimate of
the waste capacity of the repository.
<p>
The effects of the form and quantity of the wastes will be addressed by establishing bounding
values for their important characteristics, such as amount of radiation, decay heat, and
degradation behavior including radionuclide release. We will use these bounds as a basis for
designs and operating concepts. Studies will be conducted to enhance spent fuel basket designs,
to finalize waste package materials selection, and to establish feasibility of waste package
fabrication techniques. A disposal criticality analysis methodology will be developed and
documented in a technical report in Fiscal Year 1996. We will prepare a disposal criticality
topical report, which we will submit to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in Fiscal Year 1998.
<p>
Repository design activities in the near term will concentrate on resolving subsurface-related
repository issues. The surface facilities design, which can rely on a higher level of regulatory and
technical precedent in the commercial nuclear industry, will be developed later. The new design
activities will examine the assumptions made in the 1996 design report and address key
uncertainties that affect repository performance and cost, such as thermal effects and corrosion. 
<p>
Some specific engineering studies planned to support these designs are summarized below:
<p>
<ul> 
<li><em>A thermal management study </em>will provide the detailed analysis that will support a thermal
loading decision. The effort will provide an evaluation of thermal management concepts such as
a multi-level repository, oldest fuel first, ventilation, selective emplacement, and aging, with the
objectives of identifying thermal management options that should be pursued during design. The
effort will examine a reference thermal load in the high range of 80-100 metric tons of uranium
per acre, which would accommodate the full statutory limit (i.e., 70,000 metric tons) of wastes
for the repository within the planned area. 
<p>
<li><em>Evaluation of backfill</em> will provide a technical basis for a recommendation on whether an
additional engineered barrier system element, such as backfill or other concepts that perform
similar functions, should be incorporated into the system design, and if so, describe alternative
approaches. This study will discuss the design, operational, and cost considerations related to
backfill and other potential supplemental engineered barriers, testing requirements to address
uncertainties, and potential effects on performance.
<p>
<li><em>Evaluation of corrosion and degradation</em> of waste package materials and waste forms.
Short- and long-term degradation and dissolution testing of selected waste forms continued in
Fiscal Year 1996. Short-term testing of waste package materials continued and long-term testing
of container materials began in Fiscal Year 1996. Short- term results will be available before the
1998 viability assessment; the long-term results will contribute to a site recommendation, license
application, and confirmatory testing during repository construction and operation. Alternative
designs and materials will be further evaluated to ensure that they meet the regulatory
requirements, are licensable, and are deployable at a reasonable cost. 
<p>
<li><em>Analysis of safeguard and security requirements. </em>This study will consist of analyses to
assess possible threats and vulnerability to determine safeguards and security requirements for
material control and accounting and physical protection, such as security lighting, surveillance,
and intrusion detection equipment.
</ul><p>
Specific activities to develop design detail to support the 1998 total system performance
assessment and the cost and schedule estimates for viability assessment include:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Refining the concept of operations for repository subsurface and surface activities,
including assessments of reasonably available technologies.
<li>Continuing to develop the repository and engineered barrier designs to accommodate the
requirements and enhance concepts established during the advanced conceptual design, including
preliminary evaluations, material selections, and drawings of elements of design that are
important to safety or waste isolation.
<li>Evaluating feasibility of the design of components of the engineered barrier system.
<li>Conducting safety assessments for the operational period, including analyses of credible accident scenarios and provisions to keep radioactive releases as low as reasonably achievable.
<li>Developing a preliminary design and strategy for demonstrating waste retrieval.
<li>Preparing a general description of the proposed transporters for moving waste packages
underground.
<li>Preparing preliminary designs for sealing tunnels and shafts for final closure.
<li>Evaluating the stability of the tunnels during the period of operations and after closure as
affected by seismic, thermal, and normal rock stresses.
<li>Describing the general arrangements of non-nuclear surface facility designs to develop a more precise cost estimate.
</ul>
<p>
After the viability assessment, design activities will accomplish several objectives: identification
of a complete concept of operations; demonstration of compliance with codes, standards and
regulatory requirements; resolution of design issues for items with little or no regulatory
precedents; assessment of design alternatives to bound environmental impacts; and support of
potential licensing technical reports. License application design will support detailed safety
assessments and accident analyses, and will describe designs in enough detail to demonstrate
repository safety and enable compliance reviews by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
<p>
Additional design activities, building on the design products for the viability assessment, will
provide an adequate level of detail to support a license application. We will complete more
definitive designs for all elements of the repository and engineered barrier system that are
important to safety or waste isolation. Components for these important elements that have not
been proven will receive more detail, including extensive calculations and technical
specifications, than those that have been proven. Elements that are not important to waste
containment or isolation will be addressed only through a preliminary level of detail. In addition,
we will complete a description of the Nevada transportation infrastructure necessary to support
facility operations, as part of the development of the Environmental Impact Statement.
<p>
<strong>Key Performance Assessment Activities </strong><br>

Based on <em>Total System Performance Assessment - 1995, </em>we will complete additional sensitivity
analyses in Fiscal Year 1996 to improve our evaluation of the significance to total system
performance of various components of the natural and engineered barriers. These analyses will
be used to refine the strategy for evaluating waste containment and isolation and to narrow the
scope of our site characterization and design work by identifying the additional important site
and design-related information required for performance assessments for the viability assessment
and license application.
<p>
To support engineering design activities in addressing the major technical questions, we will
continue analyzing the hydrological and thermal effects of waste-generated heat and backfill on
the waste package. In addition, we will use improved data to refine models of waste package
material degradation and waste dissolution to evaluate potential releases of radionuclides. 
<p>
In 1998, the Project will complete another total system performance assessment. This
performance assessment will build on previous iterations by using more complete models of the
natural and engineered barriers than those in previous performance assessments. The Project is
investigating models of potential biosphere pathways of radionuclides that may be released from
the repository. We are also developing criteria and parameter validity tests and uncertainty
analyses to use in selecting appropriate models for performance assessment.
<p>
A phased peer review of this performance assessment will be conducted. The review will occur
in steps, beginning in Fiscal Year 1996 and finishing in Fiscal Year 1999. It will include the
models of physical processes in 1996-1998, the abstractions of these models as used for
performance assessment in 1998-1999, and the total system performance assessment itself in
1999. The comments and recommendations available from each step of the peer review will be
incorporated, as appropriate, as the total system performance assessment is developed for the
viability assessment. The comments and recommendations that are not received in time for the
viability assessment will be incorporated into the total system performance assessment for the
suitability recommendation and the license application.
<p>
The 1998 total system performance assessment will be subjected to sensitivity analyses to refine
our strategy for evaluation of waste containment and isolation and to identify areas where the
level of uncertainty needs reduction for the license application. Those analyses will also evaluate
the latest results of thermal and materials testing to verify that performance is within
expectations. Performance assessment will help define the performance confirmation testing
program by identifying testing needs. The total system performance assessment input for the
license application will respond to the final peer review of the 1998 total system performance
assessment. Additional peer review may be performed if there are substantial changes in the total
system performance assessment submitted for the license application.
<p>
<h4>2.1.4     Key Management Activities</h4><p>
Management activities have also been affected by funding reductions subsequent to the 1994
Program Plan. We are maintaining the necessary level of support to continue our key activities,
to ensure health and safety, and to fulfill our public participation responsibilities, while managing
our resources in a fiscally responsible manner.
<p>
<strong>Project Management Activities</strong><br>

Project management functions include planning, budgeting, scheduling and managing funds of
all Project elements, provision of facilities, administrative support services, telecommunications,
records management and computer procurement and maintenance, operations and maintenance of
wide area and local area networks, and motor pool operations. Project management functions
also include cost and schedule baseline management and change control. Administration of the
funds for financial and technical assistance to the State of Nevada, Affected Units of Local
Government and Nevada universities, for the National Academy of Sciences, and for
Payments-Equal-to-Taxes is also a Project management function. 
<p>
<strong>Site Management Activities</strong><br>

An additional management function is the provision of site services at the Yucca Mountain site.
These services include: emergency services such as fire protection; security services such as site
access and property protection; transportation services including bus service to and from the
Yucca Mountain site for employees, tour buses, and the on-site motor pool; communication
services including the radio network link for workers in the field and communications to the
Exploratory Studies Facility; and utility services such as power, water, and sanitation facilities. 
<p>
<strong>Management of Institutional Activities</strong><br>

Institutional activities in Fiscal Year 1996 will center around informing stakeholders and the
public about our revised program strategy. Major opportunities for formal public involvement
will include the rulemaking process to revise our repository siting guidelines, the issuance of the
Draft Environmental Impact Statement, and public hearings prior to the site recommendation.
<p>
The Project will continue to respond to information requests from the Congress and  media. The
Project will rely heavily on the new Yucca Mountain Internet Home Page to continue
communication with interested groups and individuals in a cost-effective manner. Consistent
with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we will continue to propose funding for the State of Nevada
and Affected Units of Local Government oversight activities associated with site
characterization. Program review meetings will continue to remain open to the public.
<p>
Fiscal Year 1996 funding has forced a sharp reduction in institutional activities. We are reducing
participation in national meetings and conferences and terminating exhibitions at national events;
reducing the production of information materials such as videos, photographs, and printed
material; implementing a 50 percent reduction in education staff and events and an 86 percent
reduction for educational materials; decreasing the hours of operation of our science centers and
the toll-free information number; significantly reducing interactions with the State of Nevada, the
Affected Units of Local Government, Native American tribes, and other government entities;
deferring the creation of a site-specific advisory board; and implementing a 50 percent reduction
in the number of national stakeholder meetings.
