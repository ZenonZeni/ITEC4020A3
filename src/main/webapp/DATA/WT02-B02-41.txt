<p><font size="2"><strong>Report of the Redfern Legal Centre Drug
Law Reform Project</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">September 1996</font> </p>

<p><font size="4">3. Comments on Steps to Harm Reduction</font><font
size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">A version of the Steps towards Harm Reduction
section of this report was provided to people and organisations
with expertise or interest in the area of drugs policy and drugs
law, together with a questionnaire (see Appendix 2) seeking
comments on the paper.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were sought from 55 individuals and
organisations (see Appendix 1). Written responses were received
from 21 respondents and eight responses were obtained by
interview (29 responses in all). Given the low response rate and
the ways that respondents were selected, this survey is not
designed to provide research evidence about support for or
against changes to drug laws. However, the responses allow us to
see where support appears to be forming and what areas continue
to be the subject of intense debate.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Responses were received from the following
individuals and organisations. Organisations are listed when they
provided an organisational response: otherwise the individuals
listed spoke only in a personal capacity and not on behalf of any
Organisation: </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Angela and Tony Wood Dr Peter B Paisley</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(Total responses do not always add up to 29
because some respondents did not answer all questions and some
gave overall support or opposition, rather than provide details
on specific points.)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Do you support some change in the legal current
approach to personal use and possession?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">All respondents agreed that some change was
necessary. The overwhelming majority favoured change in the
direction of some liberalisation of existing legal approaches.
One respondent supported change in the form of higher penalties
for use and possession offences. One supported additional
intervention (eg, education) as well as police intervention.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There is (and has been for decades)
overwhelming evidence that the current system not only does not
work but is cataclysmically harmful.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[Supported] for cannabis use/possession
only. Population use of cannabis has reached the point where
prohibition does more harm than good.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Counterproductive and contrary to
principles of harm minimisation and National Drugs Strategy to
criminalise users.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Should be less criminal records for these
offences, shorter time for expungement of criminal records.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">It is important to note that almost all
respondents support some change, as one of the findings of this
process is that views are polarised on the points contained in
the Steps Towards Harm Reduction. While most respondents
supported the need for changes in all of the areas covered by the
document, several respondents opposed most such changes. Those
generally in favour of change included some church groups,
doctors, lecturers, researchers, drug educators, drug treatment
staff and community based organisations. Those generally opposed
included some church groups, doctors association, drug treatment
staff and some community members.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Several respondents chose to write letters in
support of their general position. These general comments
included:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Issues of dependency could be more easily
addressed and the transmission of blood borne viruses could be
more efficiently reduced by taking the Steps Towards Harm
Reduction.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Too much attention is focused on the
question of whether the present system of drug prohibition is
working. In my view, the answer is clearly that prohibition is
not working ... But accepting that prohibition has failed is not
enough. Whether we should get rid of it depends on what we can
come up with as a replacement. Criminal law is not the only means
of regulation nor is its central presence in drug control
strategy inevitable ... The real choice is about what type of
state control is to replace prohibition as the dominant
strategy.&quot; (original emphasis)</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The case here tends to be overstated by
extrapolations and generalisations ... There cannot be a blanket
approach to encouraging safe and responsible drug use ... There
is no clear evidence that either more restrictive or more liberal
policies have achieved significant impact on the prevalence of
illicit drugs.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;The (United Nations) conventions do
reflect consensus and, with the problem of substance misuse,
there has to be a line drawn somewhere. I believe that drug law
reform, at its worst, acts to destroy all the lines and to leave
only confusion to those who desperately seek direction.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Option a. Abolish the offences of use and
possession </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents supported this change, six
were opposed, three were unsure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It's a victimless crime. What you do to
yourself in the privacy of your own home is no-one's
business.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[The current law is] counterproductive
socially and economically.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It would equal approval - a message that
drug use is OK.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;There needs to be community consultations
before progress can occur.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option b. Abolish the offence of self
administration only</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The proposal to abolish the offence of self
administration only was not included in the questionnaire
completed by respondents. However, one response noted that the
most recent Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy meeting had
resolved to form a Working Party of the National Drug Strategy
Committee to examine the self administration laws in every
jurisdiction. This Working Party is chaired by Mr Neil Bridge of
the NSW Police Service.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Option c. Vary enforcement practices (i) Better
directed police discretion</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The version of the paper circulated for comment
did not include this section, so most respondents did not have
the opportunity to comment on the proposals. The proposals were
discussed with a small number of respondents, who indicated some
support. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">(ii) Formal Police cautions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty respondents favoured this proposal,
three were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Among the supporters, two indicated broad
support for the concept, but disagreement with the details
proposed. Two supporters expressed the view that this proposal
was a poor alternative to the repeal of the offences. Another
advocated this approach before considering legislative amendment
at a later time.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Police contact, if it is a deterrent,
would be just as effective with a caution or bond as with a
harsher penalty.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Diversion of users away from criminal
charges should be used wherever possible. Unfortunately [the
Department of] Health does not resource sufficient treatment or
counselling services. Magistrates cannot refer if there are no
services. Neither can police.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Less intrusive and punitive. Gives some
option for the individual&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It should remain a court matter, but with
no convictions recorded.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">(iii) On-the-spot fines</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Seven respondents were in favour of this
proposal, with another one &quot;half in favour&quot; and 15
opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The respondent who was partially in favour
suggested that the South Australian experience was not a fair
test of the effectiveness of this approach because the law there
does not allow the police to demand identification. This
respondent suggested a variation on the proposal, with no fines
or other police attention for amount of less than 25 grams (for
cannabis), and fines for quantities in the range of 25 grams to,
say, 100 grams.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Although I favour legalisation, on the
spot fines may be a half way house&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Fines are overused as a sanction.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;They would just fill up the fines yards
and periodic detention centres.&quot; &quot;It is too difficult,
apparently, to prevent net-widening.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">V) Other suggestions</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Respondents were invited to make other
suggestions for legal change concerning personal use and
possession.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Six respondents offered comments.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Policing priorities (I guess goes with
(b)) Licensing of IV users (?), pot smokers(?)&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Some process for referral for assessment
for treatment/ rehabilitation. Need to look at withdrawing
driving licences, eg for methadone patients.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Let people grow what they like. Let the
market place sort it out. Supply good quality seed - kill the
black market. Keep it cheap. Get away from needles.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Referral options - jobs - safe
housing.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Legalise heroin and cannabis.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Continue education and encouragement of
non-use, and not starting to use: eg, experiment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Remove prison as a sentencing option for drug
use or possession</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Twenty respondents were in favour of this
proposal, and four were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Two of those in favour of this change supported
the establishment of secure, custodial rehabilitation facilities
for some drug users as an alternative to prison.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What's the point of putting users in
gaol?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;[Yes] But it should be seldom if ever
used.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Minimise or modify prison sentence,
deviation/direction to rehabilitation or treatment agencies when
possible.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">3 Allow use of cannabis for medical purposes</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents were in favour of this
proposal, three were opposed. One of those in favour supported
cannabis for medical purposes on prescription only.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Even if it is only a third rate drug -
why not allow some people to benefit?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Cannabis in smokable form is not the best
available treatment for patients suffering from any
illness.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;For some conditions (eg, AIDS related
weight loss), there is no good alternative.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">4. Allow possession of drug equipment as well
as needles and syringes</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Nineteen respondents favoured the proposal
(including one who supported legal change for bongs, but was
uncertain about injecting equipment), four were opposed. One of
those opposed to this proposal thought that a new offence should
be introduced for irresponsible disposal of used needles and
syringes.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Don't want to encourage drug use.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;It's a proven public health
success.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Present situation is patently
ludicrous.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">5 Provide safe injecting spaces</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Eighteen respondents were in favour of this
proposal, five were opposed.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Definitely. Works towards increased safe
disposal (by centralising use), decrease in overdoses (monitored
use), takes away IV use from public facilities like public
toilets, provision of counselling, health monitoring. High
priority change.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Safe for whom? These could assist in
collection of used needles which a good thing. If illegal
supplies of drugs which are being trafficked, these may prove
unsafe for users.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Socially unworkable. The practicalities
of their location and operation are enormous.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;Cannot assume beneficial public health
effect especially if current prohibitions remain in place. Also
have to ensure that such places are truly 'safe' and clients are
free from identification and police harassment.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;What about non-metro towns? They may need
them more.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">6 Allow use, possession and supply of Narcan
without prescription</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Eleven respondents were in favour of this
proposal, four were against. Most others were unsure.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Comments:</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;This is well supported in research. There
are practical difficulties with its availability. Needs to be
worked on rather than talked about!&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I don't want to see kids die.&quot;</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;100% for it.&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">&quot;I'm not sure about this, but I suppose I
should logically support it.&quot;<br>
