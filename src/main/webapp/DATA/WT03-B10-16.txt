INTERNET LIKELY TO DRIVE BUSINESS AGAIN THIS YEAR
Economic realities signal shift from interactive television

    In the world of interactivity, 1995 was the year when "interactive
services" and "interactive television" truly meant two different
things.
     The on-rush of the Internet through the computing platform meant
that interactive services predicted to thrive through the television
found a more immediate home.  Interestingly, the clarion call in 1996
of purists in the interactive television industry is that the Internet
is an intermediate step to true interactivity. 
      Observers say many issues are on the table for 1996, such as the
impending passage of the telecommunications bill now in Congress and
other policy issues, such as privacy.  In addition, many are waiting
to see whether cable modems will be deployed this year as cable
operators are predicting. 
      But most of all, said Peter Waldheim, chief executive officer of
the Interactive Television Association, Washington, D.C., the
"seamless process between PC applications and interactive television"
will continue unabated. 
     "We'll see a big push in the high-speed cable modem market to
deliver full-motion video to the Internet and create enormous
opportunities over the PC that don't exist right now.  And that, of
course, leads directly to the TV set," Waldheim said. 
     Many in the industry were caught off guard by the drama of the
shift toward the Internet and general level of interactive activity,
said John Hall, managing director, John Hall and Associates.
     "It's sort of been a Wild West year, '95," Hall said. " I think a
lot of us were taken by surprise by how much happened in '95."
     Indeed, Waldheim of ITA said companies are doing more trialing of
interactivity now than two years ago, despite some high-profile test
postponements. 
     Another key indicator of industry changes in 1995 was that the
base price the industry puts on bringing interactive services to the
home has dropped to about $1,000 per home, compared with the
assumption that an economic model would have to be between
$3,000-$5,000, Waldheim said. 
Thomas Cardy, senior vice president, Communications Equity Associates,
Tampa, Fla., said economic realities have led the shift to
Internet-based applications. 
     "Right now there's a proven market for online and computer based
services,   to the extent that you can interact and people are willing
to pay for it now," Cardy said.  "There's a business there.  There's
some question as to how you make money from an interactive television
service right now."
     Cardy said to a large extent interactive television is caught in
a generational quagmire, with older people satisfied to use their
television sets to watch TV. 
     "The folks who have the propensity to interact over some
electronic link, most of them already have a computer now.  The folks
that just have a TV probably don't have the propensity (to interact),"
Cardy said. 
     "Hall of Hall and Associates said it is doubtful that the
momentum built up in 1995 by the Internet's World Wide Web can be
sustained this year. 
     "I don't think it's possible or even healthy for the Internet and
access providers to grow at the same pace in '96 as they did the last
seven or eight months," Hall said.  "One of the critical issues in 96,
particularly for advertisers, is people are going to take a look at
the money they're putting in the web sites and take a look at the
bottom line and see what what's working."
        Analyst Connie Luecke, who follows regional telephone companies
for Duff & Phelps, Chicago, said many of those companies ae looking at
more immediate profit opportunities, such as in long distance, that
interactive television doesn't offer. 
        "I think they [RBOCs] have other things on their plate right
now that they're more interested in and more involved in," Luecke
said.  "From a perspective of what is going to be their bigger focus
and what's going to provide the most revenues and earnings over the
next few years, their focus is going to be long distance." 
   Robert Smith, president of the Interactive Services Association,
said companies will need to keep any eye toward regulatory issues in
1996.
    "You're going to see an increasing scrutiny of this industry by
federal and state government and legislators and regulators," Smith
said. "The online Internet industry is going
to have to deal with public policy makers in a very big way."

DBS COMPANIES SEEKING MARKETSHARE FROM CABLE
CATV operators keep upgrading to keep ahead

     The cable television industry spent its recent past trying to bar
the door to the euphoria of telephone companies inching their way in
on its turf through the lure of interactive TV.
But the rise of the Internet as an intermediate step to full
interactivity and the promise of quicker cash payoffs in segments such
as long distance have slowed some telecos' charge into video.
     Does that mean cable operators can retreat a bit into 1996 from
the threats to their bottomlines? Hardly.  Another relatively nascent
industry, direct broadcast satellites--those 18-inch dishes that
measure smaller than a patio barbeque--are giving cable a serious
scramble. 
DBS is "clearly an exploding market," said Harold Spielman, chief
executive officer of market researcher McCollum Spielman Worldwide,
Great Neck, N.Y.  And according to the Satellite Broadcasting &
Communications Association, 20 million U.S. homes will have satellite
service by 2000.
    "We know that RCA, for instance, has had difficulty just keeping up
on the manufacturing end of their systems, Spielman said, noting that
DBS street prices have dropped over recent months to below the
$600-mark for the equipment.  "I suspect we'll see the prices come
down more."

Fastest-Seller in History

     The largest DBS provider DirecTV Inc., a unit of Hughes
Electronic Corp. in El Segundo, Calif., for instance, unabashedly
calls DBS "the fastest selling consumer electronics product in
history."  Linda Brill, DirecTV director of communications, said the
service is up to 1.1 million subscribers after going nationwide only
in October 1994.
     DBS companies say they beat cable in choice, price and
variety--offering some 175 channels, including 60 pay-per-view
channels, and $2.99 movies every half hour.  And sports packages, such
with public policy makers in a very big way."
     The onslaught from DBS isn't expected to stop anytime soon. 
EchoStar Communications Corp., Englewood, Colo., successfully launched
its satellite into orbit Dec. 28, 1995, marking its corporate remake
from large to 18-inch dishes.
     "Our buy rates are 150 to 200 percent; cable is 30 percent,"
chimed Brill.  "Cable has had a monopoly now in this country for 20
odd years and consumers have been chomping at the bit for an
alternative."

Cable Acknowledges Threat

   Steve Effros, president of the industry group Cable
Telecommunications Association, Fairfax, Va., concedes that DBS has
posed a competitive challenge, but one that is no different than, say
"Ford is...to General Motors."
   Effros contends that cable and its 55 million households in the
United States haven't lost households to DBS, but that DBS largely has
been a rural phenomena where people don't have cable access.  
    "We have not seen any significant reduction in the numbers of
cable homes," Effros said. "Indeed, we've had the largest increases in
the last five years since DBS started.  You could try to suggest
that...we would have even larger increases if it hadn't been for DBS.
But I don't know if that's true."
     Effros said upgrading has been a way of life for the cable
industry in staying topical and meeting competitive challenges from
all rivals.  
      The key hardware announcement at the Western Show--that giant,
multiple system operators Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and
Time Warner Inc. invested $175 million to purchase 350,000 Motorola
Inc. CyberSURFR modems for initial installation in April 1996--showed
the industry's resolve to sniff out immediate cash opportunities while
it awaits interactive TV. 
    And, for instance, Cablevision Systems Corp., recently announced a
$300 million investment in a fiber-optic telecommunications system in
northeast Ohio that will bring video-on-demand, computer connectivity
and interactive services.

Always Upgrading           

    "We're always upgrading," Effros said. "This is just a constant
infrastructure process.  We can't move as fast as an industry that
just starts off with a given technology."
    A recent study from Frost & Sullivan estimates that expenditures
for cable associated hardware and technology services will grow by
about 6 percent per year to 1999 to $2.36 billion.  
    Effros said much is riding on the cable industry's development of
modem technology, as a way to help beat back DBS "as soon as we start
interconnecting computers via broadband systems because it's something
DBS can't do."

Industry Must Do More

    Spielman of McCollum Spielman Worldwide said the satellite industry
must do more to explain to consumers what it has to offer.
        "I think that the service deliverers have done such a terribly
poor job of explaining in their advertising what this is all about.
The consumer really does not know," he said.
    Spielman said DBS marketing is reminiscent of the "obscure"
advertising of home video cassette recorders when they were introduced
some 15 years ago.
        "I think that's the same situation with this," Spielman said. "
People do not know what a dish will do, what they will get from it.
They have no perspective on cost."
    Additionally, as new companies see dollars signs in DBS, some
question whether rivalries among the satellite firms companies will
stunt the industry's growth."

TELEPHONY, CABLE PROPELSALES OF VOD SERVERS 
Storage demands are expected to maintain impact on prices

     Telephone and cable television companies will be the two leading
segments that will drive the sales of video-on-demand servers through
2000, a research report says. 
    Sales of servers, which initially will be priced high because of
their storage needs, will increase from $131 million in 1994 to more
than $1.3 billion in 2000, according to the report,
"Video-On-Demand--Technology and Economics," from  Hodge Computer
Research.
     Each segment has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, the
report states. 
    "Due to recent legislation allowing telcos to deliver video
programming, they will become very large players in this arena," it
states.  "They will be able to deliver programming to their
subscribers on their own telephone lines. [These lines] may be used to
carry normal telephone traffic simultaneously with the delivery of
video."
     There is no reason to believe the telephone companies cannot be a
formidable force in video services, the report says.  They presently
are delivering programming in numerous test locations--and the
barriers to telco program provision are rapidly falling. 
     Telcos also have "direct connections to nearly every home in the
United States, or at least every one that would be a candidate for pay
per view (PPV) Interactive TV," according to the report, released to
IVN's sister publication Video Technology News.
     Cable operators, meanwhile, already have a large installed base
of video service subscribers.  The report estimates that there are
58.8-million cable households in the United States.  They are served
by 11,217 cable operators.
    "Only a few firms currently offer ITV services, and those only on
a trial basis," the report says.  "Total subscribers are estimated at
fewer than 5,000.  Of these, we estimate approximately 2,000 are
served by massive banks of VCRs into which cassettes are manually
inserted in response to the customer's telephone call."
    The percentage of cable subscribers who also have bought pay
services has declined steadily since 1988, when 85 percent of cable
subscribers (42.4 million) bought pay services, according to the
report.  By 1993 this percentage had decreased to 72.6 percent. 
(Because of the increase in TV homes, the actual number of pay
subscribers increased to 42.7 million.)
      Video servers initially will be priced very high due to the
immense amounts of disk storage and RAM memory required to deliver
hundreds of movies to thousands of subscribers, according to the
report.  The two most significant cost factors in a video server are
the disk farm on which the video programs are stored and the RAM used
to buffer the video data prior to transmission, the report explained.
      Hodge predicts that VOD server pricing will fall from $1.35
million in 1995 to $797,000 in 2000.

CHIP INTEGRATION, 3D, COMMUNICATIONS EXPECTED TO STORM MULTIMEDIA
MARKET

     Three-dimensional graphics, improved chip functionality and
enhanced communications are the top three developments expected to
penetrate the home market for multimedia in 1996.
     But don't anticipate major changes on the multimedia landscape
before the second half of the year, according to key manufacturers and
industry analysts, who spoke with Multimedia Week Editor Judith
Abrams.
    The most visible multimedia enhancement expected in the software
and chip businesses will come in the form of 3-D games.
    "We see 3D permeating the graphics world, offering a slew of
features and performance that just aren't available today," said Ken
Wirt, vice president of marketing, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc. 
"By the end of the year, you'll probably see a significant number of
PC systems come 3-D enabled."                    
    More consolidation in the chip industry, with companies attempting
to buy each other and integrate several functions onto a single chip,
is expected in 1996, with companies that have strong markets in one
area (audio, video or communications), trying to expand.
    The current trend is to combine 2-D, 3-D and digital video, but
more functions could be on the way.
    Whether new chip designs make it to the motherboard is another
question.
    Intel Corp. is expected to deliver its MMX initiative, an
enhancement of its next-generation processor with multimedia
extensions, sometime in 1996. However, "I don't think it will be ready
until the second half of 1996," said Richard Chang, an analyst with
Bear Stearns & Co. 
    Cable modems are expected to impact the CD-ROM as a means of
delivering content, but they will not threaten the disc business in
1996.
    "The idea of delivering the kind of graphics we build into a game
through the Net and high-speed modems is at the moment a fairy tale,"
said Ben Tenn, vice president of marketing for Activision Inc.  "It
can take you two days to download the video we put on a couple of
CDs."
    Diamond's Wirt forecasts 1996 as a year in which transmission
companies will begin work on new services, but delivering service is
another story.
    Expect more advances on the Internet and in other kinds of modem
technology.  More PC manufacturers are expected to add digital
simultaneous voice and data modems (DSVD) to their products.
    Despite budget increases, CD-ROM prices are coming down.
    "Everybody's very concerned about the lower-end price points." said
Robert Peterson, an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc.  "The average
price will go down because of the growth in the budget category. It's
going to continue to sell."
    Meantime, multimedia PC manufacturers are expected to continue to
drop prices, but a high-end, niche category that emerged in late 1995
will continue.
    "There is a market for higher-end, upscale game machines that were
popular during Christmas," said Bruce Stephen, an analyst with
International Data Corp.  "We will see more focus on the $1,500 price
points, but manufacturers will try to keep them up and refresh
features.

COMPANIES POSITIONING TO DRAW IN CONSUMERS
Pricing models, security remain thorny issues

     As the delivery of interactive service made a sharp turn in 1995
toward the computer and Internet--and for now away from the
television--the star of electronic banking suddenly has never shined
so brightly. 
          Financial institutions, interactive services companies and
software developers all are positioning themselves to get electronic
banking in the forefront of consumers' psyche.
          Toward the end of last year, Intuit Inc. and America Online
agreed to offer banking to AOL members in the first half of 1996.  And
Microsoft Corp. outlined its plans for banking software in December. 
On the interactive television side, Barnett Banks in Florida signed up
with Time Warner's Full Service Network to create a so-called
"virtual" banks in the Orlando trial.
       Procedures, pricing models and security concerns all must be
worked out this year, but companies that deliver electronic banking
services say the potential for consumer acceptance is high, based on
high consumer reliance on automated teller machines and voice response
systems, experts said.
          "What we're beginning to see is sort of a seamless process
beginning with banks using PC applications for interactive banking
that will lead to interactive television banking," said Peter
Waldheim, chief executive officer of the Interactive Television
Association, Washington, D.C., which plans to release a study in the
first quarter of the year, "Interactive Banking at Home '96."
       "1996 will be a terrific year in terms of expanding the numbers
of banks now beginning to map their banks' future in electronic
media," Waldheim said.
    Indeed, many of the nation's major banks and financial services
companies, including Citibank, Wells Fargo and American Express
publicly stated last year that they would go a step further and offer
free electronic banking access.
     "It's really not about the financial institutions, it's really
about consumers and first making them aware and giving them a good
offer.  By good offer, I mean free," said Matt Lawlor, chairman and
chief executive officer of Online Resources and Communications Corp.,
McLean, Va. 
       Lawlor said pricing will be vital to consumer acceptance of
home banking.  Three pricing models are emerging, he said.  "If you
want the consumer in masses, then the pricing has to be down there. If
it's a bill payment then it ought to be down there where the cost of a
stamp is," Lawlor said. 
          Harold Spielman, chief executive officer of market researcher
McCollum Spielman Worldwide, Great Neck, N.Y., however, cautions
against euphoria over electronic banking. "This [electronic banking]
is one of those things where it seems to me its time for a piece of
good research on what people are actually doing or not doing.  It's
totally vague right now," Spielman said. 
      Catherine Corby, director of electronic delivery strategy for
Barnett Banks, Jacksonville, Fla., agreed that in 1996 banks will need
to show consumers how electronic banking will benefit them. 
    Telecommunications Research Inc., an Arlington, Va., researcher,
predicts that about 5 million U.S. subscribers will be banking online
by 2005. 
    A key issue to pushing electronic banking is deciding which
interactive services and software companies to partner with.  
     That presents a challenge for the banks since in the past they
have gone it alone when it came to innovation, ITA's Waldheim said.
      "One of the things that is very exciting about interactivity,
particularly interactive TV when it comes about, is that it will be up
to the cable company or the telephone or the platform to market the
bank to a certain degree. It's in their interest that banks on their
platforms are successful," Waldheim said.
     Security of accounts and transactions remains an issue, but many
industry officials believe that is easily and ultimately solvable
through marketing since consumers typically have confidence in their
financial institutions. 
    " As the banks move forward, they have systems to address the
security issues," Online Resources' Lawlor said. "What the consumer
will get is the confidence of their institution."

SKEPTICS OF ELECTRONIC BANKING WERE MORE RECEPTIVE LAST YEAR

    As director of electronic delivery strategy for Barnett Banks,
Florida's largest banking company, Catherine Corby spearheaded the
Jacksonville-based institution's recent inclusion in Time Warner
Cable's interactive television trial, Full Service Network, in
Orlando.
    In an interview with Interactive Video News Editor Marvin Greene,
Corby takes issue with electronic banking models proffered by software
companies and says financial institutions need to put the technology
on consumers' front burners.

IVN: What was 1995 like for electronic banking, and what's ahead for
this year?  

Corby: I think the skeptics were finally driven into seclusion [in
1995]. The key for really breaking out for the consumer is when we are
really using our PCs to receive mail.  Not just turning the PC on once
every two weeks, but having it become a vital part of our lives. 
     At the point that merchants can deliver bills electronically to
consumers on their PCs that are integrated with their financial
services programs or interactive services that they're working on, at
that point I think home banking will be prevalent.  Until then, I
think it's going to take customers with patience who are willing to
get around or overlook some of the shortcomings with the current
services, or institutions that simply don't overpromise what they
can't deliver.
     What I've learned from consumers after working with interactive
services for 15 years in the financial services world is if you do a
poor implementation of a technology, you set that opportunity back
several years because consumers have long memories about what didn't
work.  And it's hard to convince them it's better now.

IVN: Explain how electronic banking is going to work on the Full
Service Network in Orlando with Time Warner.

Corby: What we've tried to do is to create the same kind of an
environment that you have when you come into one of our current
banking stores, from the perspective that you learn about us, you
learn about our values, you learn about our products and services
through the merchandising that we do.
    When you come into our venue on the Full Service Network you will
be presented with the opportunity to walk around and browse as you
might in a store, or to go very quickly to the specific area where you
want to conduct a specific transaction.  We don't force you into one
mode or the other. The customer chooses...all in a virtual
environment. 

IVN: Your model of electronic banking differs from that of software
companies like Intuit and Microsoft?  What do you think of their
approach?

Corby:  If we keep going down the model that Intuit, for example, is
setting out, then the personal finance software becomes the heart of
the banking relationship.  And the information for any one financial
institution gets filled in.  In that environment, home banking becomes
defined as paying my bills, seeing my balances.  That is not a broad
electronic delivery service in the home.  That is a transaction
service.  
    For the financial institutions, if we go and accept that model and
don't challenge it and try to build more consumer value, then I think
we're going to be working ourselves into a very narrow place into the
home in the world of electronic commerce.  I think we have the chance
today, and that's why we got involved with Time Warner, to develop a
much more comprehensive service, one that really is an electronic
store.

IVN:  You have been quoted previously as saying home banking has to be
"engaging, informative and fun."  How do you make banking fun?  

Corby:  I think there are two ways you do it.  You take it just the way
retailers has managed to make shopping fun in stores while other
retailers have not paid any attention to it and have a totally
different market.  You can't make banking fun if it's looking at a PC
screen that has a bunch of account statements and numbers on it.
      But if you can create the store electronically and let people
browse, and go to what interests them and learn about you and your
institution through the electronic media, I think it's possible. The
other thing is you have to take all the clerical aspects of it away.

IVN:Do you think the television is a good medium for electronic
banking.

Corby:   I think the issue of TV or PC is irrelevant. Because the fact
is that      the TVs are becoming more like PCs and the PCs are
becoming more like TVs. What you need to think about is whether you're
talking about a 10-inch interaction or a 10-foot interaction, because
they are different things that take place in different rooms in the
home.  One involves group activity.  One involves more single
activity.  You have to think about it that way.
     I believe the 10-foot environment is a place where you can bring
financial services into the home. It's not necessarily where you're
going to sit down and do detailed financial management.  But that's
not what consumers do every time they think about doing banking. 
Sometimes they're curious and they want information. They're thinking
about, "Maybe I want to move to a new house and I wonder what's
involved."  
    If we can get ourselves positioned so that when they start thinking
about those kind of things, they think to turn to their financial
institution to learn. Then we're able to sell.

IVN:How big of a concern is security on electronic mediums for
consumers?

Corby:   I think it's a very big issue for consumers as well as for
financial institutions.  It's one that we're addressing. But it's a
huge issue and we're going to have to pay attention to it all along.

BELL LABS TOUTS VIDEO DEVICE

    Bell Laboratories says a 1969 invention, the charge-coupled device,
now used worldwide in solid-state video cameras, has become part of
the first panoramic viewer to provide a 360-degree live-action view
from a single vantage point.  The system can be used in a wide variety
of applications where other cameras cannot, such as movie theaters,
interactive TV, videoconferencing and home shopping.  It also could
provide panoramic surveillance in prisons, department stores, casinos
and day-care centers.   Unlike other panoramic viewers that use a
rotating lens or multiple cameras, the Bell device has no moving parts
and operates from a single vantage point, allowing it to be used for
both still pictures and full-motion video photography at all
distances.

CATV SERVICE GROWTH AHEAD 

    Paced by the upgrading of cable systems to offer telephony,
video-on-demand and interactive services like home shopping, U.S.
sales of cable TV-associated hardware and technology services will
grow from $1.78 billion in 1994 to $2.36 billion by the year 1999 at a
6 percent compound annual rate, projects a new Frost & Sullivan study.
In the study, "Profiles of CATV-Related Companies,"  services
including engineering, construction and network management will rise
from 10 percent of revenue in 1994 to 25 percent in 1999 and
transmission and distribution lines will increase from 15 percent to
24 percent. Competition will encourage cable operators to invest in
construction programs they otherwise might delay due to revenue losses
from rate reductions mandated by the FCC, the study said.

INTERNET SHAKEOUT PREDICTED

    Cable and telephone companies will create even more competition in
the increasingly crowded field of companies providing Internet access.
That will led to a shakeout of such providers, says a report by the
Yankee Group in Boston. There are more than 1,400 Internet service
providers to the corporate and consumer markets; Yankee predicts there
will be 60 providers by 1999.  "Most of the local `mom and pop'
operations and smaller regional providers will be crushed by their own
growth," said Greg Wester, Yankee research director.

FASHIONABLE CYBERSPACE

    Some in the fashion industry believe their next frontier is
cyberspace: shopping at home via the computer with on-line services
and CD-ROM.  "It's the wave of the future," says Dallas designer
Anthony Mark Hankins, whose clothes debut this month on Home Shopping
Network-BET Shop.  TV shopping has developed into a $4-billion
industry over the past decade, and analysts say computer-based
shopping, which now generates about $300 million in sales annually,
could be a $20 billion industry by 2000.

TELECOM BILL DELAY STALLS INTERACTIVE INDUSTRY
Resolution of issues not likely until February

     Affordable technology and economies of scale have been the great
inhibitors to credible deployments of consumer interactive
applications.  Most industry observers point to the lack of investor
certainty in the legislative and regulatory climate as primary
culprits to the industry's stalled development.
     "The industry is waiting for Congress to provide the new rules
necessary in this new era of convergence," concedes Senate Commerce
Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-SD), the senator commissioned
with reforming the Communications Act of 1934 in the image of the
Republican Revolution. "And that is what we are trying to accomplish."
      Yet it appears that Congressional meddling has provided even
more uncertainty because of its inability to reach agreement among the
two chambers, with the communications industry, and with the White
House about how to pass a telecommunications regulation reform bill.
      The situation has been further exacerbated by the budget
impasse, which not only is preoccupying Congress and the White House
from completing legislation, but also is steadily deteriorating an
already contentious relationship between Congress and the White House.
       That contentious relationship between the legislative and
executive branches has resulted in constant changes to the bill
throughout the process as Republicans attempt to exert their
deregulatory vision of communications policy against constant veto
threats by the president.
        Regulatory attorneys have been taking advantage of the time
spent debating on legislation to provide their clients with the only
source of certainty.  "At least now we know how to manipulate the
system," jokes a Washington attorney who specializes in challenging
cable regulation.  
         The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) likewise has felt
the impact of the telecom legislation debacle, tentatively basing
regulatory decisions on the interpretation of legislative tea leaves,
yet unwilling to commit itself for fear of alienating a Congress that
has threatened its very existence.
       Investors, however, want to know that if they invest in new
interactive technologies and new applications, communications
attorneys representing potential competitors will not cause delay.
      "Most technology-driven cable companies and interactive
application start-ups are severely undervalued right now," says Philip
Getter, vice president of investment broker Josephthal Lyons & Ross,
New York.  "Investors are skittish about committing money to an
industry with an uncertain regulatory future."
       The answer, investors and industry players agree, is a quick
resolution to Congressional efforts at completing telecommunications
regulation reform.  "The potential benefits of this bill to the
interactive, multimedia, and entire communications industry is mind-
boggling," says House Telecommunications Subcommittee Chairman Jack
Fields (R-Texas).  
       With a completed bill, investors would get their certainty,
lawyers will still have work to do during the transition, start-ups
will have access to more capital necessary for interactive
applications, and consumers will receive a litany of choices to
communication providers, most of which will use interactive
application to differentiate their value.
       Currently, a conference committee report, dated Dec. 22, 1995,
is being circulated around the Hill awaiting signatures from
conference participants to buoy support in preparation for a vote in
both chambers.  
       In that conference report, the cable industry would be freed
from pricing regulation three years after the enactment of the bill,
unless they face "demonstrable and effective" competition, in which
case they could expect immediate relief upon FCC approval.
    The hold up, however, is on the liberalization of foreign ownership
restrictions and cyberporn regulation.  Advanced TV spectrum policy --
whether to auction it or provide it for free to incumbent broadcasters
also is an issue of substantial contention that drew comment from
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS). The Clinton administration claims
that the auction of broadcast spectrum could garner $50 billion for
the U.S. Treasury, a "hysterical" estimate, according to Republican
staffers. 
        Congress and the White House have until Feb. 20 to resolve the
issues, though, as the Senate will not consider any unscheduled votes
until then.  Although the House has looser rules about votes this
session, the less disciplined bunch has more Republican Revolution-
oriented issues to take up while the Senate gets its schedule in
order.
        Many observers consider the cable provision, though, the most
important for the interactive industry because the cable industry is
most likely to pursue the more complex consumer applications.
