ONLINE GAMBLING HITS THE WEB
Is Internet Casinos' Cyberspace Venture
A Crapshoot for Internet Commerce?

      Internet Casinos Inc. soon will be stretching
the bounds of the Internet, and in the process raising
serious questions about how federal and state gambling
and tax laws apply to cyberspace.

      From a casino based in the Dutch Caribbean
island of St. Martin, the company plans to launch an
online gambling hall, styled after traditional
casinos, on the Web in mid-May.  The site will offer
keno, blackjack, roulette, backgammon, animated horse
racing, more than 30 different slot machines and a
variety of other games of chance.

      The regulatory quandary is that the online
community will play with - and win - real money.
Internet Casinos will require players to send a
minimum of $50 to the offshore casino, and the online
gambler then will receive an account and password for
gambling.  Winnings then can be wired back to the
player within 48 hours, or can be deposited back into
the offshore account to earn interest and serve as
holdings for future gaming.

      While it may sound like a dubious proposition
that few would attempt blind, about 1,500 online users
have preregistered for the site since it first went up
a week ago, said Internet Casinos President Warren
Eugene.

      "We feel that the 'net community is capable of
looking after themselves," Eugene said.  "This is a
First Amendment issue."

      The casino's virtual doors will open May 15, but
no money will be accepted until one week before the
launch, Eugene said.  The company already has $1.2
million to bankroll the Web casino, with a $1 million
line of credit available, he said.  To keep the casino
fluid until it builds a solid cash reserve, bets are
kept to a $500 maximum, although the minimum goes as
low as 5 cents for the slot machines.

      Payment can be made by Visa, MasterCard and
cashier's check, Eugene said, adding that the company
is in discussions with both DigiCash BV and CyberCash
Inc. about adding their online payment capabilities.

New Dimension Because of Location

      While issues of local control in cyberspace have
been raised before, most notably when states try to
prosecute the placement of pornography online, the
Internet Casinos venture raises questions of law and
tax liability because of its location outside this
country.

      Online gambling networks such as the systems
being marketed by subsidiaries of Interactive Network
Inc. and NTN Communications Inc. are restricted by
laws in different states that govern what types of
betting can be conducted from the home or designated
locations.  Because Internet Casinos is located
outside the United States, at-home wagering laws and
age restrictions technically may not apply to the Web
site.  "We're being very cautious about not violating
international laws," Eugene said.

      The odds of this system going online without
challenges are slim, since there is no way for the
company to monitor the age of potential gamblers and
many state governments have retained tight
restrictions on gambling.  But there may not be much
that the federal or state governments can do to
prevent the online gambling.

FBI to Make Statement on Online Gambling

      The Federal Bureau of Investigation soon will
make an announcement relating to online gambling
issues, and would not comment for this article until
after the announcement is made.

      Aside from state concerns over gambling, the
federal government also has a stake in this type of
offshore venture.  Gambling revenues are taxable
income, but if cyber-winnings from Internet Casinos
can be kept in the foreign bank, the government may
have a difficult time taxing these funds.

      Eugene insists the venture is legitimate, and he
is publishing the algorithms and codes used for the
games for users to verify the slots are not "rigged."
Interactive Casinos will spot-check the system to
ensure it is not tampered with, he said.

      Internet Casinos can be reached at (416)
444-8835.

OPEN MARKET TO RELEASE COMPETITOR TO NETSCAPE
Will Use Multiple Security Schemes

      Open Market Inc. made multiple moves to
re-establish itself in the quickly crowding market for
Internet commerce solutions, announcing a host of new
software products and services and a relationship with
First Union Corp. to bring its customers onto the
Internet.

      Among the new products is a secure World Wide
Web server aimed at supplanting Netscape
Communications Corp.'s early lead in providing the
basis tools to companies that want to sell on the Web.

Moving Into Service-Oriented Business

      The broad suite of products launches Open Market
out of its first phase, which consisted of hosting
information vendors in an online marketplace, into a
new service- and tool-oriented business.  At the
center of this business is the Open Market Secure
WebServer product that distinguishes itself from
Netscape's Netsite Commerce Server and Spry Inc.'s
forthcoming SafetyWeb by supporting the two leading
security protocols - Netscape's Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) and the secure hypertext transfer protocol
(S-HTTP) supported by most other Web developers - in
one package, giving it maximum possible exposure to
Web users.

      Netscape has taken an early lead by establishing
its Navigator Web browser as the largest in use.  But
even with a current estimated 77 percent of the
browser market, Netscape has no guarantee it will
continue to dominate.  As quickly as it took the lead,
it could be supplanted by a newer, niftier product.

      The majority of other Web browser makers are
licensees of Spyglass Inc., (the master licensor for
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications
[NCSA], which developed Mosaic) and Spyglass is firmly
behind S-HTTP.

      Although Netsite will build S-HTTP into future
versions of its secure products (REC, March 7, p. 1)
the time frame for integration is uncertain.  Open
Market, by supporting both standards, suddenly looks
like the server of choice for companies that want to
do business now with the whole Web and not wait to see
what Netscape does.  Although Open Market will license
SSL from Netscape, terms of the arrangement were not
available.  Netscape has stated that it intends to
offer the technology to all comers for a one-time
licensing fee.

      The release of tools is directed at larger
companies with  established brands who don't want an
intermediary between themselves and their
audience/customers.  One of the first adopters of
Secure WebServer is Time Inc., which is migrating its
popular Pathfinder Web site to Open Market's software.
Time plans to begin charging for subscriptions to its
online magazines and services in the next few months.

      "These new products allow companies to do
business over the World Wide Web on their own terms,"
said Shikhar Ghosh, chief executive of Open Market.
"They support electronic commerce in a way that
transcends mere transactions by supporting ongoing
customer relationships and the creation of brand
identity."

      Other adopters of Open Market's server include
Lexis-Nexis and the Copyright Clearance Center.  Both
companies are using the software for Lexis-Nexis'
Information Marketplace project to sell copyrighted
material over the Internet while ensuring that holders
of intellectual property receive full compensation for
their work.

Rebuilt Server Technology From Ground Up

      Like Netscape, Open Market says it has rebuilt
the server technology from the ground up.  The company
claims both faster performance and support for as many
as 1,000 simultaneous users.

      "The Open Market WebServers are not derivatives
of freeware server implementations," Robert
Weinberger, Open Market's vice president of marketing,
said.  "They have been architected from scratch to
achieve the highest levels of performance,
functionality and interoperability."

      This is especially important as security gaps
and faults are turning up in the HTTP implementations
available as freeware from NCSA and CERN, the European
Laboratory for Particle Physics.  The Computer
Emergency Response Team, the quasi-public Internet
security patrol that tracks developing problems with
the network's integrity and keeps records of attacks
on sites, issued a warning in February that sections
of the public domain server software are inherently
insecure and could allow malevolent  hackers access to
a company's entire system through the Web server
holes.

Secure Link to Transaction System

      Unlike Netscape, however, Open Market also will
market a full system to enable transactions, including
a back office connection to a transaction network to
process credit card charges.  The separate module,
called the Commerce Connection, establishes a secure
link to Open Market's existing transaction system to
process orders in real time.  Open Market also will
provide billing services if necessary.

      In an agreement with First Union Corp., the
server software will be used to host an online mall
for as many of the bank's 35,000 merchant accounts as
choose to develop an online presence.  First Union
also will try to encourage its account holders to use
the system to access their account information and
will move quickly to get every department in the
Richmond, Va., bank to use the Internet to reach and
service customers.

      The Secure WebServer will be demonstrated
publicly at the Internet World trade show in San Jose,
Calif., April 10-13 and should be available
commercially by the end of April.

      It will sell for $4,995, but carry a mandatory
annual service charge of $1,995.  Commerce Connection
will retail for $2,495 and also carry an annual
service charge of $1,995.  Open Market is selling an
unsecure version of its WebServer for $1,495.
Security can be added to that product using a $3,995
Security Module.

CompuServe BUYS SPRY FOR $100M
Everyone Has A Browser; What Next?

By Nate Zelnick
Associate Editor

      Now that CompuServe Inc. and Spry Inc. have
agreed to tie the knot - with the online service
paying a hefty $100 million dowry for its new mate -
links between the top consumer online services and the
World Wide Web are nearing completion.  All that
remains is dealing with the hangover after the
cheerful reception and, of course, paying all the
bills.

      One particularly knotty question is how the
online services will deal with secure access to Web
sites that plan to sell goods and services through
secure connections with consumers.  CompuServe
Information Services' (CIS) customers will use Spry
technology, which supports only the secure hypertext
transfer protocol (S-HTTP), while Prodigy Services Co.
and Delphi Internet Services Inc. have licensed
Netscape Communications Corp.'s technology and - in
the short term - will use Secure Socket Layer (SSL)
only.

      The number of users coming in from the consumer
online services likely will double the total number of
Web-capable users in the United States alone.  While
server and browser makers are moving quickly to expand
their secure transactions offering to all available
customers on all platforms, the consumer online
companies have had to recast themselves to match the
pace of technical innovation on the Internet.

Adding 'Access' Like Jumping on Train

      The primary problem is that Internet
applications such as the Web are not static features
that can be added to an existing system; adding
"access" to it is like trying to board a moving train.
Web software developers are struggling to upgrade the
presentation and application interfaces of servers and
browsers.  Netscape's proprietary extensions, which
add everything from the silly and annoying "blink"
feature that flashes lines of text on a page to the
long-needed image adjustments that allow developers to
wrap text around a picture or present text in columns,
are a contentious issue for other developers who
resent Netscape's moves to add to hypertext markup
language (HTML) without first consulting the standards
bodies.

      In the face of this problem, CompuServe's
decision to buy Spry - even at what seems an extremely
high premium - makes good business sense.  Compared to
America Online Inc.'s $35 million purchase of
BookLink, an untested company with only one product
(which never was tested in the market), Spry's price
was a bargain.

      CompuServe and Spry are a match made in heaven.
CompuServe is buying a fully operational company with
lots of products in the marketplace and consistent
black ink on its balance sheets.  Privately held Spry
generated $16 million in revenue last year and, based
on annualized projections of first-quarter earnings,
was expected to make more than $40 million this year.

      Even more important is the ever-elusive synergy
so often cited in mergers and acquisitions.  In this
case it may be real.  Spry and CompuServe both have
impressive credentials in the corporate arena.  Not
only is CompuServe the business favorite because of
the rich databases of CIS, but its Network Services
division provides private dial-up facilities for Visa
International Inc.'s network and other big businesses.

      Spry's AIR series of transmission control
protocols/Internet protocols (TCP/IP) connectivity
tools and the recently released Internet Office suite
of internetwork applications are corporate favorites
for building private and public Internet links.  The
company also launched an aggressive plan to market its
turnkey Internet access software packages, Internet in
a Box and Mosaic in a Box, to corporations wishing to
use the Web as a communications medium to reach their
customer base.  General Electric Co.'s plastics
division was the first big company on board (REC, Dec.
13, 1994, p. 9).

      Spry President David Pool - who personally will
pocket between $20 million and $30 million in the
purchase of the privately held company - told REC in
December that Spry planned to develop deals with all
comers.

      "We want to ship a disk with every refrigerator
so that  customers can just pop it into their
computers and reach the manufacturer's Web site," he
said.  Under the original plan, Spry would pay a
bounty for every customer a third-party company
brought onto the Internet using Spry software.  Pool
said the company plans to continue this venture using
CompuServe's network as the primary carrier.

      The use of the network will be the key
competitive change in Spry's business.  In the initial
release of Internet in a Box, Sprint Corp.'s
SprintLink network was the primary carrier and charged
an exorbitant $8 per hour to connect to Spry's wholly
owned access provider InterServ (although users could
connect to any point-to-point protocol [PPP)
provider).  Pricing for the network connections will
be announced April 11 at Internet World in San Jose,
Calif.

      Spry also brings to the table its other
"affiliated companies," Free Range Media and NovX,
both of which were brought back into the company last
month.  Free Range provides Web authoring services and
design consultation for companies developing
commercial sites.  NovX develops and sells
pre-configured server computers.

      Spry has sold more than 200,000 copies of
Internet in a Box to consumers through book and
computer stores.

CHANGE AT INTERACTIVE GIFT
MAY SIGNAL STRONG PATENT STAND

      Interactive Gift Express Inc. (IGE) named a
corporate turnaround specialist its new chairman and
president, a move that may be a precursor to the
company taking a stronger stand on its patent
affecting electronic commerce applications.

      Arnold Freilich takes the president's helm from
Robert Cosby, who came on board at IGE last December
around the same time the company acquired what is
known as the "Freeny patent."

      The patent covers "the transfer of digital
information to a material object at the point of
sale," and, if enforced, it theoretically covers the
use of debit cards in certain situations, sales
through bulletin board services, and the digital
transmission of software from a central site to remote
locations for recopying and sale.  This type of system
is being developed by IBM Corp. and Hughes Network
Systems Inc. using DirecPC satellite technology.

Resignation Only Part of the Shake-up

      Cosby's resignation was just part of the
shake-up in the company's upper echelons.  Company
founder Clarence Jolley stepped down as chairman of
the board but retains a spot as director, while his
two sons, Layne and Wayne, have resigned from the
board.  Michael Franzese, Arthur Casey Stern III and
Grant Robertson also joined the board, bringing the
number of directors to five.

      Although Freilich characterized Cosby's
resignation as amicable, the new president admitted
Cosby was not geared toward IGE's interactive business
plan.  IGE's core business has been its wire-based
gift delivery service, but the company plans to move
quickly into the multimedia market, Freilich told REC.
Part of IGE's new business will be branching into
kiosk-based touch-screen gift ordering, along with
bringing their traditional paper-based catalog online.

      IGE is looking at a variety of online service
providers, including America Online Inc., for porting
the gift catalog online, Freilich said.  The company
has not ruled out venturing onto the Web or into
Internet malls, however.  With both the kiosk and
online ordering services still in the planning stages,
IGE plans to take its first steps into the interactive
market through licensing and litigation.

      IGE has stated its intention to license the
Freeny patent, and litigate against possible
infringers.  The company recently brought in David
Fink, former senior vice president of patent
exploitation firm Refac Inc., to head its licensing
effort.  IGE also completed a private placement of
convertible notes to finance this campaign.

      While the Freeny patent has the potential to
generate millions of dollars in fees, IGE needs the
voluntary licensing from at least one large company to
legitimize its claim.  Enforcing broad interactive
patents can be a costly proposition if IGE is forced
to take all infringers to court.  Also, in the new
realm of digital commerce and communications, broadly
worded multimedia patents are finding it difficult to
stand up before the courts and the government, as
evidenced by the rejection of Compton's New Media's
patent on multimedia navigation that was shot down
last year by a patent review board.

      Although the company is keeping a tight rein on
its patent, it will be very selective in terms of
which companies it will go after, Freilich said.
"We're not afraid to go to court, but we're not going
to say this patent covers the world," he said.

      IGE reportedly was in discussions with IBM Corp.
and Bank of America, but Freilich would not comment on
any of the company's negotiations.  Aside from his
role on the board, Franzese is a full-time consultant
to Bank of America.  According to Freilich, IGE is
very close to licensing its technology to a
"noteworthy" client, and expects to announce this
arrangement within three to six months.

FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION SET TO COVER E-MAIL
IN COMPLEX NEW FRAUD REGULATIONS
Cumbersome Rules May Well Hamper Electronic Commerce

By Michael F. Cavanagh
Contributing Editor

      On Capitol Hill there is a strong wind blowing
against onerous federal regulation, but down the
street a few blocks at the Federal Trade Commission,
sweeping new rules are evolving rapidly - rules that
would rewrite a substantial part of direct marketing
law and put cyberspace under a complex new regulatory
scheme.  (Unlike a proposed bill in Congress, which
must move through the often arduous legislative
process, federal regulations need only be approved by
the agency proposing such rules after public comment,
and thus there is a certainty of action.)

      What the FTC is doing, in a nutshell, is taking
myriad issues relating to telemarketing abuse and
squeezing them into an opportunity to regulate
electronic mail, online services and cyberspace in
general.  These rules are targeted at business
dealings with "consumers," not most
business-to-business transactions, but the nature of
the requirements could make the distinction between
consumers and business employees almost meaningless.

Acting in Response to Telemarketing Act

      To be sure, the FTC is acting in response to the
Telemarketing Act of 1994, signed into law last August
to fight deceptive (and also highly annoying)
practices employed by some telemarketers.  Congress
directed the FTC to establish a set of specific
regulations to fight the estimated $40 billion per
year that is lost by consumers as a result of
telemarketing fraud.

      The law defines telemarketing as any plan,
program or campaign conducted to induce payment for
goods or services via the telephone.  The FTC states
in its Federal Register notice announcing the proposed
rules, however, that it has made "one addition" that
"clarifies" the definition.  The FTC adds "the use of
a facsimile machine, computer modem, or any other
telephonic medium" to the definition of telemarketing.
Thus, e-mail suddenly is at the heart of a complex set
of new rules and regulations.

      Experts on the issue told REC last week that the
"addition" is remarkable in that Congress had no
intention of dealing with computer communications in
this legislation.

      According to noted analyst John Awerdick, an
attorney in Newark, N.J., who is representing several
major companies in this proceeding:  "It's clear that
the Congress was aiming the legislation at plain
vanilla telemarketing fraud."  The  problem, said
Awerdick, is that "while there shouldn't be deceptive
advertising in any medium, the time and nature of
disclosures to the consumer may need to differ" based
on what medium is used.

      Washington attorney Allan Adler, who will be
filing comments with the FTC on behalf of the Direct
Marketing Association, said that "instead of focusing
on the scam artists that led Congress to enact the
legislation, these [FTC] drafters regulate the entire
broad spectrum of telephone use, portraying  it as
inherently risky."  The telephone has been around for
a long time, Adler said, and "one can now only imagine
how the FTC plans to treat cyberspace [now that it is
to be covered under their regulations.]"

What Do Regulations Require?

      What specifically do these regulations require
from anyone who makes over 10 "sales" of anything
annually via the telephone, fax and e-mail combined?
(This is the new definition of "telemarketer.")  The
long list includes strikingly different disclosures
and practices, depending on whether or not the sale
involves office equipment, cleaning goods, a
charitable  contribution, any prizes, equity in a
business.  The list goes on and on.

      As a fairly general matter, these proposed
regulations require that "before payment is requested
for goods and services offered" the seller must list
all terms and material restrictions, cancellation
policies, exchange and refund options, etc.  Detailed
records now must be kept, listing all solicitation
activities for a 24-month period.

Complete List is Long One

      To detail the complete list of regulations with
which telemarketers must comply would take virtually
this entire issue of REC.  While many of the
provisions are quite benign and do seek to target real
fraud patterns, virtually anyone involved in
electronic commerce will need to know what they are.
More precisely, they probably will need to have a
lawyer close at hand when anything that could be
construed as marketing takes place.

      As previously noted, there is an important
exemption to these regulations, but one that is
particularly problematic for the electronic mail
industry.

      These regulations exempt most (but not all)
business-to-business solicitations.  Given that,
what's the problem?  Think about it.  In an
extraordinarily high number of situations in the
e-mail world, it's impossible to determine whether or
not the e-mail address listed is a personal or
business mailbox, or indeed whether the person uses
that mailbox for personal as well as  business use.
(Below you will find an e-mail address for this
writer.  Is it a business or personal address?  Do you
want to risk prosecution by a state attorney general
in order to find out?)  Similarly, the use of many fax
machines blurs with respect to whether it is business
or personal.

      In light of the vast array of new issues raised
by coverage of e-mail, is it possible that the FTC has
added "modem" communications inadvertently to this
proposal?

      Quite the contrary, as it turns out.  Several
times in the notice respondents (anyone who comments
on a proposal) are asked to address whether or not the
definitions are "sufficiently broad to encompass
current as well as future technology."  In  fact, it
appears clear that the FTC views this telemarketing
rulemaking as its entrance into cyberspace regulation
and that the commission wants to be sure that its
definition covers everything imaginable.

      In sum, the Federal Trade Commission is poised
to actively enter cyberspace and begin the regulation
of all electronic commerce.  Most reasonable people
would say that consumers do deserve protection from
fraudulent operators,  regardless of what mechanism
they use to perpetrate their deceptions, including
electronic mail.

Frustration at Attempts to Overreach

      On the other hand, it also might be appropriate
to suggest that the backlash against government rules
and regulations demonstrated recently at the ballot
box probably manifested an American frustration with
regulators' attempts to overreach logical bounds when
expanding rules designed for one purpose into areas
that have not been examined adequately.

      There still is time to have your organization
comment on these proposed regulations.  The full text
of the proposed regulations are found in the Federal
Register of Feb. 14, 1995, on pages 8313 through 8333.
Formal comments must be submitted to the FTC by March
31.  (Full instructions can be  found in the Federal
Register notice.)

FOLIO AND PARTNERS OFFER INFO
COMMERCE, COPYRIGHT PROTECTION
API Provides Reimbursement Scheme

      Folio Corp. and a group partners are offering a
technology package designed to meter digital
information usage over wide area networks in support
of electronic publishing on the Internet and
commercial online services.

      If this metering system becomes standard, which
is a goal of the partnership, information in private
databases may leave the privilege of the business
world and become affordable to the home user for the
first time.

      Folio, along with Novell Corp., the Copyright
Clearing Center (CCC) and several information metering
systems makers announced March 6 an application
programming interface (API), server software and
secure links to a transaction system that will provide
a reimbursement system for use of copyrighted material
sold on the Internet or other wide area networks such
as Novell and AT&T Corp.'s AT&T Netware Connect.  The
Folio metering API is the key component of a system
called the Information Marketplace proffered by the
company and its partners, which also include Wave
Systems Corp. and CD-Max Inc.

      Folio, of Provo, Utah, recently was bought by
Reed-Elsevier PLC, which also owns the Lexis-Nexis
databases for legal and news information.

      The system is designed for publishers who want
to offer electronic access to their data, but are
afraid that going digital means losing control of
their materials.  Currently, these newsletter,
newspaper and database publishers have had to use
high-priced proprietary systems such as Dialog
Information Services Inc. and Lexis-Nexis, which limit
their potential audience to institutional researchers
and tie them to clunky interfaces on proprietary
networks.

      With internetworking growing faster than any
previous communications medium in history, the
opportunities for content providers are huge, as are
the risks.

      Folio's InfoBase technology has been a popular
way to distribute material on disk or CD-ROM.  The
Information Marketplace moves that model into the
wider world of internetworks such as the Internet,
although it also can be used on proprietary or
commercial networks.

      "The Folio API is a logical extension to our
existing Rights Management technology which today
allows publishers to restrict usage of infobases on
CD-ROM by the number of users, or for a specified
period of time," said Tracy Scott, president of Folio
Corp.  "Now we can extend those capabilities to meter
information on a per-transaction basis, which will
allow users to only pay for what they use.  This will
open up new markets for publishers in cases where
their information has been prohibitively expensive or
otherwise impractical for use by small companies and
others who, for one reason or another, do not
currently buy subscription-based information
products."

A la Carte Charging Solves Problems

      The ability to charge users on an a la carte
basis over the Internet solves several problems.
First, by offering discrete segments of data,
companies can price their products lower, which allows
them to expand their markets.  A la carte also allows
information to be priced according to its intrinsic
value, instead of valued generically by subscription.
A longer feature or study printed in REC, for
instance, can be priced differently from a round of
news briefs.

      The CCC partnership will allow companies that
adopt the Folio metering API to link into the right's
database of more than 1.7 million publications.
Through that link, and with access controls provided
by companies such as Wave Systems, Infobase Systems
Inc. and CD-MAX (each of which has announced support
for the API) users can be positively identified, their
access limited to areas for which they have rights and
their use of products tracked for billing.  Connection
to the CCC enables the holders of copyrights to be
compensated based upon the specific content accessed.

      "In most cases, traditional print publishers and
authors have been unwilling to release their
copyrighted materials in digital form without adequate
protection of their copyrights," said Joseph S. Alen,
president and chief executive officer at CCC.  "By
providing both technological and contractual controls,
the Folio/CCC relationship promises to dramatically
increase the flow of digital information from rights
holders to users."

      For Web-based applications, Folio is using a
secure server technology developed with Open Market
Inc. (see story, p. 3).  The product is in beta
testing now and is expected to be commercially
available by early summer for $6,995.  The Folio Web
Server will provide links to the CCC's database and a
separate system to be developed to provide clearance
for intellectual property not handled by the CCC.
Secure links also will be provided to a third-party
billing service that will process transactions, but
not track the exact materials accessed to ensure
anonymity of research performed over the network.

Wave Systems Designed Encryption Chip

      Wave Systems already has designed an encryption
chip around the Folio metering API, and has licensed
it to VLSI Technology Inc. to manufacture the chips.
Aside from electronic commerce applications, Wave
Systems may use the technology to create rental or
pay-per-view business models with the database
material, said Amelia Burkhart, Wave Systems
spokeswoman.  Wave Systems is working on applications
that will meter data usage and cut off access after
set periods of time, she said.

      Initial metering API-compliant products will be
released this year to meter local area networks and
CD-ROM, with wide area network and Internet capability
planned for late this year and 1996.  Wave Systems
plans to have its private network chips ready by
spring, with Internet and Web versions ready by the
end of the year, according to Burkhart.

      Although prices haven't been set, Wave Systems
expects its chip to sell in the $100 range.  While
home users may not buy the chips as an add-on, Wave is
working on bundling arrangements with computer
companies, peripheral manufacturers and publishing
companies, Burkhart said.

      Folio can be reached at (801) 229-6331; CCC at
(508) 750-8400; and Wave at (413) 274-1400.

MEDIO MULTIMEDIA MOVES
INTO ONLINE MARKETPLACE

      Medio Multimedia Inc. is approaching advertisers
about electronic commerce opportunities available with
the company's forthcoming hybrid CD-ROM magazine to be
launched in June that will include links to the new
MedioNet Internet access service.

      Medio has held discussions with Dewars scotch,
which already advertises on the regular CD-ROM
magazine, and has approached retailers such as
Nordstrom, Macy's and Nike about selling products in
an online marketplace being developed by the company,
said John Rutter, Medio senior vice president of sales
and marketing.  The online mall is likely to be
available by August or September, he said.

MedioNet Will Cost $9.95 First 2 Months

      MedioNet, slated for a national launch later
this year, will be priced at $9.95 for the first two
months and $19.95 for the following months.  The price
tag includes a copy of the CD-ROM magazine to provide
the software link, and 40 hours of Internet access.
Medio launched a pilot Internet access network in
Seattle, Wash., that eventually will use the company's
CD-ROM magazine as the front-end to reach the
Internet.

      This pricing model doubles the Internet time of
online service Delphi Internet Service Corp. - $20 for
20 hours - and gives Medio a dual revenue stream.  The
company will collect its basic Internet access
charges, along with money from advertising on the
CD-ROM magazine.  Linking MedioNet with the CD-ROM
also boosts the subscriber base for the magazine,
which commonly is used to determine pricing structure
for advertising.  The magazine also is sold
individually through retail channels.

Modem Speeds Up to 28.8 Kbps

      MedioNet will support modem speeds up to 28.8
kilobits per second, and is working with U.S. Robotics
Inc., Digital Equipment Corp., Cisco Systems Inc.,
Sprint Corp., NorthWestNet, Structured Communications
Systems Inc. and Teleport Communications Group to
provide the infrastructure for the Seattle system.

      Medio is well positioned to create a
multimedia-rich online market, because
memory-intensive audio and video clips can be stored
on the company's CD-ROM for immediate access, leaving
the online connection free to transmit information
updates and ordering commands quickly.

      The actual ordering component will not include
online credit card transactions in its initial
rollout, Rutter said.  Medio takes credit card orders
for its CD-ROM magazine over the phone, and these
numbers will be used by the company to collect payment
for online orders when the system is in place.
Eventually, Medio wants to move to online credit card
orders, perhaps using an in-house system for secure
payment, Rutter said.  But it is more likely the
company will license a "name brand" secure transaction
technology from another party, he added, which will
make consumers more comfortable ordering over
MedioNet.

      With the CD-ROM magazine becoming the front-end
for MedioNet, the company is working to boost the
disk's circulation before the service extends
nationally this summer.  This week, Creative Labs
ordered 100,000 copies of next month's magazine to
send to its customers that register their multimedia
upgrade kits, Rutter said.  This registration
incentive boosts Medio's circulation to 150,000.
Rutter expects Creative to order a similar amount
every quarter.   Medio can be reached at (206)
450-9965.

BAXTER IMPLEMENTING CD-ROM
WITH EDI PURCHASING CAPABILITY

      Hybrid CD-ROM catalogs with online connections
for ordering are becoming commonplace, as 2Market Inc.
and Interactive Catalog Corp. bring consumer and
business-to-business solutions into cyberspace.

      But the system that health care supply giant
Baxter International Inc. is implementing puts an even
newer spin on CD-ROM-based electronic commerce -
Baxter is using electronic data interchange (EDI)
technology over proprietary networks as the
transmission medium instead of the Internet or one of
the online services.

      This week, Baxter announced it was replacing its
old Analytical Systems Automated Purchasing (ASAP)
hospital procurement system in favor of the OnCall*EDI
system developed by TSI International Ltd.  Baxter
will phase out its ASAP support by the end of 1996.

Transition Forces Hospitals' Transition

      Baxter's transition to OnCall*EDI all but forces
most of the 6,000 hospitals using the DOS-based ASAP
to make the transition to the open x.12 standard TSI
is marketing.  Baxter's health care division provides
medical supplies to more than 4,000 of the country's
estimated 6,600 hospitals, according to Bob Bouton,
TSI vice president of marketing.

      Using a CD-ROM version of Baxter's Source 2000
catalog created by Automated Catalog Services L.P.,
hospitals can search through images and text of 80,000
hospital products and place the EDI order right from
the disk.  The TSI system is windows-based, and
hospitals can zoom in on product images along with
ordering by pointing and clicking.

      The two-way connection allows Baxter to provide
immediate price updates to the disk, and speeds up the
procurement process for the hospital.  Down the road,
an automatic payment system will be built into
OnCall*EDI, allowing hospitals to link their
purchasing with accounting systems for immediate
verification and delivery of funds, Bouton said.

      "CD-ROM catalogs in a lot of ways offer benefits
over online catalogs," said Torrey Byles, director of
electronic commerce for market research firm BIS
Strategic Decisions.  "This type of system is very
quickly going to become widely used in other areas."

      TSI already has shipped a few hundred OnCall*EDI
platforms to Baxter, which is reselling the units to
hospitals it services, and Bouton expects hundreds of
further orders to come through in the next six to nine
months.

      Moving away from the proprietary ASAP system
also will benefit Baxter's competitors, which will be
able to tap into the OnCall*EDI system with their
CD-ROM product catalogs.  Aside from manufacturing its
own brand, Baxter also distributes competing products
from other companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, and
the new ordering system will provide a more level
playing field for manufacturers that want to target
hospitals directly.

      Baxter can be reached at (708) 689-5009; TSI at
(203) 761-8600; ACS at (610) 687-7500; and BIS at
(408) 492-9823.

INDUSTRY.NET HEADS TO THE WEB
Manufacturers Enter Information Age

      After existing as a direct dial-up information
service for the manufacturing community, Industry.Net
moved to the World Wide Web to advertise its wares in
its electronic marketplace.

      The Industry.Net Online Marketplace allows
manufacturers to place product and price information
online for industry buyers to browse and collect
information.  About 3,300 companies promote products
on the service.  They pay between $450 a month and
$40,000 per year for the privilege, depending on the
size of the electronic display and how many regions of
the country the companies want to reach, Industry.Net
spokeswoman Autumn Jones said.

100,000 'Buying Members' Use Service

      About 100,000 "buying members" access the
service to examine products from "selling members"
such as IBM Corp., Rockwell, Honeywell and Alan
Bradley.  In addition to product information, the
service includes industry news briefs, discussion
groups and electronic mail to send questions to
companies displaying their products.

      Although the new Web service is strictly
informational, within three months Industry.Net will
add the capability to conduct online purchasing, Jones
said.  It still is undetermined whether ordering will
involve receiving a purchase order number for later
billing by regular mail, or will allow credit card
orders to be transmitted over the Web.  Industry.Net
uses servers from Netscape Communications Corp., which
would allow for an easy switch to Netscape's secure
commerce technology.

      After watching the information revolution taking
place throughout the corporate world, the
manufacturing community slowing is beginning to take
notice of the potential for electronic commerce to
facilitate purchasing and other business-to-business
transactions.

      At National Manufacturing Week's Design Show
last week, the spot where Industry.Net premiered the
Web service was the only booth with a connection to
the Internet, Jones said.  But the low-tech days of
manufacturing communication may be coming to an end.

      Aside from online markets such as Industry.Net,
CD-ROM catalogs also are becoming a popular method to
convey parts catalogs and price information to buyers
and other vendors (see story, p. 12).

      While CD-ROMs allow for snappier multimedia
presentations, online trading floors have the
advantage of immediate ordering and price updating.
Industry.Net's Web site has been running as a trial
for about a month and has received about 60,000
logons, Jones said.  The company projects more than 1
million logons by the end of the year.

FEUD BETWEEN IN, NTN WINDS DOWN

      While the feud may not be over yet, the battle
between the Hatfields and the McCoys of the
interactive television gaming world finally may be
winding down.  Interactive Network Inc. (IN) and NTN
Communications Inc. announced an out-of-court
settlement March 6, ending at least part of a
decadelong dispute over technology allowing home users
to play games and win prizes from set-top boxes,
personal computers and gaming systems.

      Although terms of the settlement were not
disclosed by either party, the arrangement is
basically an "I'll go one way, you go another" deal,
in which neither side will sanction the other's
products.  As representatives from both parties
stated, no licenses changed hands.

      The two companies have been locked in disputes
over IN's interactive gaming patent.  Although a 1987
settlement gave NTN a worldwide, royalty-free license
on the technology, the company wanted to introduce
evidence that the patent actually was taken from
technology developed at NTN originally.  IN denied the
claim, and a court ruled last November NTN could not
sue because of the terms of the 1987 settlement.  This
latest settlement puts to rest questions on whether
IN's "IN The Huddle" football game infringes on NTN's
proprietary "QB1" football game.

      Although the companies still are in dispute on
other areas of the patent, IN now will offer "IN The
Huddle" to its 5,500 network users in its five test
markets.  With this legal hurdle out of the way, IN is
hoping to raise money to continue its market trials,
said Dave Lockton, IN chairman and chief executive
officer.  The football dispute "put a cloud over us in
the financial community," Lockton said, expressing
hope that the remaining issues with NTN can be worked
out in a similar arrangement.

      IN can be reached at (408) 325-5016, and NTN at
(619) 438-7400.

AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANS
ELECTRONIC IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT

      American Airlines Inc. will conduct a six-month
test starting this summer of an in-flight
entertainment system that gives passengers access to
movies and electronic games on flights between the
United States and Europe.

      Passengers will operate the system through a
handset at each seat.  The airline is remodeling its
fleet of 41 Boeing 767-300s and installing digital
telephones compatible with the systems.  The handset
also will operate the phone, and a phone jack at each
seat will allow a passenger to send faxes from
portable computers.

      The service will be available in all classes of
service.  However, first-class passengers will use
video units mounted on the arms of their seats while
other passengers will use monitors on the seat backs
in front of them.

NEW 2MARKET CD-ROM DUE EARLY MAY

      2Market Inc., the interactive CD-ROM shopping
service owned by America Online Inc. (AOL), will issue
its second disc in early May, according to Michael J.
Minigan, vice president for business development.

      The golden master of the disc will be delivered
to the manufacturer in the first week of May, with
shipments occurring shortly thereafter, Minigan told
REC.  For now, the service, which also is available on
AOL, is scheduled to be updated twice a year.

      The disc will contain fewer than 26 catalogs,
the number that appeared in the premiere issue, he
said, but each catalog will contain more information.
The change is due, in part, to market research
following on the release of the first disc last year.

      "People wanted fewer catalogs but more
merchandise from each," he said, declining to name the
new catalogs that will be added to the service.
Current offerings include Crutchfield, Land's End, The
Learning Company, The Nature Company, The Sharper
Image and Sony Music.

      Other improvements in 2Market's next issue will
be a simpler method of ordering merchandise over a
modem, Minigan said.  "If we make it even easier to
use, we've got a grand slam," he said.

MovieFone EXPLORING KIOSK,
ONLINE TICKET SALES

      With 67 percent growth in its 1994 revenues,
MovieFone Inc. is looking beyond its traditional
phone-based information service to kiosk and online
models this year.

      MovieFone revenues totaled $22.6 million in
1994, up from $13.5 million the year before.  At the
same time, the company's losses were cut to $1.9
million from $2.2 million in 1993.

      MovieFone is riding into profitability on the
back of a national expansion campaign.  In 1994, the
company received 33.3 million calls to its service,
which provides updated information on where movies are
playing in local areas, and also allows consumers to
purchase tickets in advance.

      While 95 percent of calls were for information
rather than transactional purposes, MovieFone expects
purchasing to increase as the company offers other
transmission methods, company spokesman Andrew Jeske
said.

      A new kiosk service called MovieLink is being
tested quietly in a few cities throughout the country,
including New York and Los Angeles.  The interactive
kiosks use video clips to preview movies, and
MovieFone is experimenting with purchasing capability.

      The company also is exploring using its existing
Web site as a foundation for online movie information
and ticket sales, but both of these projects are still
being tested, Jeske said.

      MovieFone is at (212) 504-7557.
