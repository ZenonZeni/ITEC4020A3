Provincial Parks<BR>
in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area


</B></CENTER><P><BR>

The goal of Ontario Parks is to provide a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities, and to protect provincially significant natural, cultural and recreational environments in a system of parks.  This goal is supported by the four objectives of protection, heritage appreciation, recreation and tourism.<P>

Provincial parks offer a high level of protection for natural resources and other significant ecological and heritage values.  Access to parks is carefully controlled, and management plans are developed for each park with public input to set the park's overall direction and appropriate activities that can take place within it.  Mining, mineral exploration and commercial timber harvesting are not allowed in provincial parks.<P>

There are seven provincial parks in the Temagami area:
<UL>
<LI><I>Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park</I> is a 72,400-hectare wilderness class park.  The park was created in 1983 and, as a wilderness class park, offers the highest available level of resource protection within the provincial park system.  Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater's significant features include the highest known point of land in Ontario, and the park supports a diverse mix of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems -- including the original habitat of the endangered Aurora Trout, and several Brook Trout and Lake Trout communities.  Wetlands, upland meadows, rock lands and forest and plant species typical of the transition zone between the Boreal and the Great Lakes Forest Regions are found across the park.<P>

Although Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater was created as a wilderness class park, several non-conforming activities -- such as hunting, trapping and mineral exploration and development -- were initially allowed to continue.  For several years after the park was created, the Liskeard Lumber Road continued to be used for both timber hauling and recreational access.  However, in May 1988, the Government of Ontario decided to eliminate these non-conforming uses from all provincial parks.  The Liskeard Lumber Road was closed to timber hauling by the end of 1991.  Motorized use of the road for recreational access is still permitted, but a gate closure is enforced for the core of the park between June 15 and September 15.  All current activities and uses in the park will be reviewed during the development of the park's management plan, which is currently being prepared.  This  process will determine the extent to which non-conforming uses will be permitted in the future through consultation with affected stakeholders and communities.<P>

<LI><I>Obabika River Provincial Park</I> is a waterway class park with an original area of about 17,000 hectares.  The park contains a diverse range of water-based recreation settings, with extensive shoreline concentrations of old-growth red and white pine forests.  In 1996, the government confirmed that it is adding 3,520 hectares to the park to protect the Lake Obabika North old-growth forest stand, bring the total park area to 20,520 hectares.  (For further information on old-growth forest stand protection, please refer to the following fact sheets:  Conserving Old-Growth Red and White Pine Forest Ecosystems in the Temagami Comprehensive Planning Area; and  Lake Obabika North Old Growth Red and White Pine Forest.)<P>

<LI><I>Makobe-Grays Provincial Park</I> is a 1,427-hectare waterway class park encompassing the Makobe River at its point of departure from Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park north to the Town of Elk Lake.  Regulated as a provincial park in 1985, the Makobe River is swift in the spring, when the water flow is controlled by the surrounding geology, but becomes a small-stream waterway by the summer.<P>


<LI><I>Solace Provincial Park</I> is a 5,943-hectare waterway class park consisting of several small lake environments connected by small portages.  Jack pine and white birch are the park's dominant forest species, and some of its lakes support self-sustaining Lake Trout populations.<P>

<LI><I>Sturgeon River Provincial Park</I> is a 3,350-hectare waterway class park, and is a river system typical of many found in the Canadian Shield.  The free-flowing system consists of rapids that pass over bedrock sills and narrows that separate small-lake widenings.<P>

<LI><I>Finlayson Point Provincial Park</I> is a 37-hectare recreation class park on the shore of Lake Temagami, one kilometre south of the Village of Temagami.  The oldest provincial park in the Temagami area, Finlayson Point was created in 1963, and serves the demand for car camping from regional travellers on Highway 11.  The park contains 114 campsites nestled in a distinctive forest setting of large-diameter, old-growth red and white pine trees.<P>

<LI><I>W.J.B. Greenwood Provincial Park</I> is a 465-hectare recreation class park on the south shore of Bay Lake, two kilometres south of the Town of Latchford.  The park was regulated in 1986, and protects early successional white birch forest, scattered stands of white and red pine, and stands of sugar maple and yellow birch.  Although existing demand from car-based campers is currently well served along Highway 11, the park may be suitable for the future development of trails and boat-in camping to promote increased tourism and recreation in the Temagami area.

<B> Resource Protection</B><P>

The four waterway class parks in the Temagami area -- Makobe-Grays, Obabika, Solace and Sturgeon River -- interconnect with Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park.  Collectively, they protect a network of outstanding natural and cultural heritage features, including:
<UL>
<LI>90 kilometres of cold water streams;
<LI>seven major self-sustaining Lake Trout lakes and other lakes that sustain Brook Trout populations;
<LI>the most northerly sugar maple forest in the eastern part of the 4E Site-Region;
<LI>some of the best examples of old-growth forest stands in the Temagami area, including red and white pine-dominated communities;
<LI>ancient Aboriginal travel routes, including portages, campsites and sacred sites, such as Maple Mountain;
<LI>a network of historic fire towers; and
<LI>remote camping in highly attractive settings.
</UL><P><BR>

<B>Economic Impact</B><P>

Back-country recreation, commercial fly-in operations and guided wilderness travel through Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater and the connecting waterway class parks make a strong contribution to tourism in the Temagami area.  A recent study estimates total back-country recreation use of the area's parks and Crown land at 60,000 user-days per annum.<P><BR>


<B>Management Status</B><P>

The operation of provincial parks is subject to individual park management plans, which are developed with public consultation.  The Ministry of Natural Resources approved a management plan for Finlayson Point Provincial Park in 1985, and the park plan is currently under review.  Management plans are currently being prepared for the six other provincial parks in the Temagami area, and these should be completed by the spring of 1998.<P>
