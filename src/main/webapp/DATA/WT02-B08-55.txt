<font size=4><b>What is Cellulite?</b><br></font>

Cellulite is characterized by dimpled or bumpy areas at the skin’s surface, most often in the hip and buttock areas of the body.  These dimples are actually tissue bands in the fat that are &quot;tethered&quot; together at various places, thus causing a puckered look.  Because women physiologically have higher percentage of body fat than men and more subcutaneous body fat in the hip and buttock areas, cellulite is experienced primarily by females.<p>



<font size=4><b>Causes of Cellulite</b><br></font>

Although it is not conclusively known whether cellulite is hereditary, it is clear that the condition is directly related to the skin’s elasticity in specific areas.  Therefore, a series of weight fluctuations can cause cellulite due to a reduction in the skin’s tautness in certain areas.  In addition, activity levels and nutrition also contribute to the laxity of the skin.<p>



<font size=4><b>Treatments</b><br></font>

<b>Surgical</b><br>

The appearance of cellulite may be reduced by  <i>liposuction</i> of the affected areas.  This procedure is performed by a plastic surgeon as outpatient surgery and involves thinning of the fatty layer and releasing the tethered bands of tissue in the skin.  Selective fat-grafting, where small amounts of fat are re-injected into hollow areas, may also lessen the appearance of cellulite.<p>



<b>Chemical</b><br>

Most commonly, creams containing <i>aminophylline</i> are used to treat areas of cellulite.  However, creams with <i>theophylline</i> are also used with even greater results due to its higher stability and shelf-life.  These chemicals are natural products belonging to a group of plant compounds called xanthines,, which includes caffeine in coffee and theobromine in chocolate.  The main action of xanthine-based creams is to help mobilize fatty acids from fat cells, thus encouraging those fat cells to reduce in size.  Many women report significant results with the continued usage of these types of creams.<p>

<b>Other</b><br>

Exercise and nutrition are also important in promoting the skin’s elasticity.  Keep the body at a healthy level by practicing the following:<br>

<dd><ul>

<li><i>A Low fat Diet</i> - fruits, vegetables, grains, limited salt, plenty of water

<li><i>Moderate exercise</i> - twenty minutes of aerobic activity three times a week

</ul></dl><p>
