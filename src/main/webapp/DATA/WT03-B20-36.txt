<H2>Chapter 2: Energy and U.S. Economic Productivity, Environmental Quality, and National Security </H2>
<HR><P>
<I>(Note: Figures referenced in this chapter have not been included at this time.)</I><P>

 

Energy policy is motivated by the economic, environmental, and national security implications of energy production and use. An analysis of recent trends indicates that our Nation has made substantial progress in several key areas, while in other areas, energy-related risks have grown.<BR>

<P>

How well is our energy system performing in terms of meeting the goals of economic productivity, environmental quality, and national security? Recent data show that the Nation has made significant progress in several areas, but some trends continue to work against the attainment of national goals. This chapter describes the main forces that shape our energy picture, discusses economic, environmental, and national security implications of the current path of energy development, and explains how risks and opportunities define the scope and intent of the Administration's energy policy.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="2.1">U.S. Energy Production and Use</H4></a>

 

An overall description of the U.S. energy system includes all of the purchases of fuel and power by consumers, business, and industry (that is, energy demand quantified in dollars or energy units) and all of the sales of fuel and power by market providers (that is, energy supply quantified in dollars or energy units). By definition, demand equals supply in both dollar and energy terms.<BR>

<P>

Energy demand depends on the energy service requirements of consumers and firms and on the technologies they use to turn fuel and power into heat, light, mobility, and other services. Energy supply is determined by the natural resources (renewable or nonrenewable) that provide energy and the technologies used to extract, convert, and distribute energy products to end-users. As shown in Figure 1, total U.S. energy consumption increased more than 25 percent in the past two decades, with expanded use of electricity in residential and commercial buildings contributing most to this growth. The energy sources that fueled the growing demand for electricity were mostly nuclear power and coal, as shown in Figure 2. Oil imports also increased more than one-third to meet the increasing need for fuel in the transportation sector and to offset declining domestic production. The overall growth in energy demand, however, was outstripped by the 65-percent growth of the U.S. economy over the same period.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="2.2">Energy and Economic Productivity</H4></a>

 

Reliable and competitively priced energy supply has played a critical role in supporting U.S. economic growth and the high standard of living now enjoyed by most Americans. In 1993, the United States produced and imported raw energy resources worth roughly $159 billion-primary energy that was mostly in the form of fossil fuel extracted from the earth (see Figure 3). Energy producers converted these resources to end-use energy worth $505 billion, split between $307 billion of solid, liquid, or gaseous fuels and $198 billion worth of electric power. Domestic energy production and distribution represent about 8 percent of total gross domestic product (GDP). In addition to the $505 billion spent directly on fuels and power in 1993, energy users spent hundreds of billions of dollars annually on equipment, vehicles, buildings, and other energy-using goods.<BR>

<P>

Energy is also a major component of our international balance of trade. In 1994, net U.S. oil imports of $46 billion and net imports of natural gas worth $4.5 billion represented 7.5 percent of total domestic imports. The impact on the balance of trade was partly offset by the net export of $2.5 billion worth of coal and billions of dollars worth of exports of energy technology and related products. To put these numbers in perspective, the trade deficit in 1994 was $151 billion.<BR>

<P>

Energy supply markets and demand markets have changed considerably over the past 25 years. On the supply side, greater competition has led to expanded production of coal, natural gas, and renewable energy under conditions of stable or even falling energy prices.<BR>

<P>

On the demand side, as technology has become more efficient and the U.S. economy has shifted away from energy-intensive industry, the amount of energy that we use to produce a dollar's worth of GDP-the energy intensity of the economy-has declined, as it has in most other industrialized economies. This trend of U.S. GDP growth outpacing energy use is expected to continue for at least the next 15 years (see Figure 4). <BR>

<P>

The increased demand for energy services has been partially offset by more efficient use of energy in all three major end-use sectors. The net result of this mix of trends has been relatively stable or slowly growing energy demand in most sectors. <BR>

<P>

In 1992, the United States accounted for nearly one-quarter of world energy consumption; however, its share of world energy demand has been declining. In the next several decades, the United States is likely to face increasing competition for the world's energy resources, particularly from the rapidly expanding economies of East Asia. The Energy Information Administration's International Energy Outlook 1995 forecasts that, by 2010, energy use in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries will be about 26 percent above 1992 levels, while the non-OECD countries will increase their energy use by almost 48 percent; other projections indicate even more rapid growth in demand in developing countries. Increased global energy demand could lead to higher real energy prices in the United States as a result of our trade in energy, especially oil.<BR>

<P>

Compared with other developed countries, the United States and Canada remain the most energy-intensive, in part because of dispersed geographic development (increasing transportation distances) and more severe or varied climates (requiring both heating and air-conditioning in many regions). These indigenous factors are reinforced by relatively low U.S. energy prices that reflect natural abundance, a mature energy infrastructure, and low energy taxes. Energy prices in the United States are considerably lower than those of most other industrialized countries, which has helped energy-intensive industries but has muted the incentives for greater reductions in our economy's energy intensity. For example, as shown in Figure 5, gasoline prices in the United States are lower than in other industrialized nations, contributing to high rates of motor-vehicle use.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="2.3">Energy and the Environment</H4></a>

 

Energy transformation and consumption are the primary sources of most harmful air pollutants and greenhouse gases. Although considerable progress has been made over the past two decades in limiting or reducing air pollutants (see Figure 6), significant air-quality problems persist in some areas. Because our environmental regulatory system tends to focus on individual technologies, we have made more progress reducing the pollution produced per unit of energy use (or per unit of energy service delivered) compared with the slower pace of reducing overall levels of pollution (see Figure 7).<BR>

<P>

The global climate changes likely to result from increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases pose another potentially serious environmental problem related to the production and use of energy. Unlike the case with several other energy-related air pollutants, emissions of carbon dioxide (the principal greenhouse gas) from energy use have been generally rising over the past 10 years and are expected to continue to rise (see Figure 8).3 Although many uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude, timing, and regional effects of such global climate changes, there is mounting evidence that climate changes could begin to occur early in the next century and that, if current trends continue, these changes could ultimately have significant harmful effects on economic growth, human health, and the stability of vital ecosystems.<BR>

<P>

Energy production and use also have other important impacts on the environment, such as energy-related water pollution, including oil spills; nuclear, toxic, and other waste disposal problems; and disruption of sensitive land and natural ecosystems.<BR>

<P>

Existing environmental laws and regulations help reduce the adverse effects of many of these energy-related environmental impacts. However, some pollutants are not controlled, and progress toward a cleaner environment has been accompanied by increasing costs. Because these high costs could limit further progress, the Administration is committed to the development of new technologies and new approaches to environmental regulation that will help minimize the costs of pollution reductions. In particular, the Administration has initiated a shift toward more performance-based regulation that can achieve environmental goals at a lower cost by giving industries more flexibility in selecting compliance strategies.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="2.4">Oil Use, World Markets, and Energy Security</H4></a>

 

Petroleum has provided the largest share of energy for the United States since 1950, although its share of total primary energy consumption has declined from a peak of 49 percent in 1977 to about 40 percent in 1994. Since the United States became a net importer in 1948, U.S. oil imports rose to nearly 50 percent of domestic requirements in 1977, fell to roughly 30 percent of domestic needs in 1985, and have risen steadily in the past decade to once again reach the 50 percent level (see Figure 9).<BR>

<P>

Meanwhile, U.S. domestic oil production has been declining since 1970. Today, proved U.S. oil reserves represent only about 2 percent of the world total, while the United States consumes more than one-fourth of world oil production. As shown in Figure 10, almost two-thirds of world oil reserves are located in the Middle East (nearly 20 percent of world oil reserves are located in Iran and Iraq alone), and another 12 percent are located in Africa and the former Soviet Union. These regions recently have experienced considerable social and political turmoil. According to the Energy Information Administration, the Persian Gulf will become the dominant source for oil traded on the world market, accounting for two-thirds of global oil trade within a decade (see Figure 11). This concentration could increase the sensitivity of world oil prices to the political and social situation in the Middle East, raising the prospects for future oil market disruptions and price shocks.<BR>

<P>

The last three sharp increases in the world oil price (1974, 1979, and 1990) were each followed by periods of negative economic growth (see Figure 12). Beyond the direct economic impact of consumers and producers paying a higher price for an important commodity, the resulting increases in the overall price level and perceived risk of inflation have challenged monetary and fiscal policy authorities to formulate appropriate responses to world oil price increases. Shortcomings in previous economic policy reactions have amplified the negative impacts of oil price increases and helped to trigger recessions. Because fiscal and monetary policies may not respond appropriately to future sharp increases in world oil prices, sudden and pronounced increases in oil prices could contribute to recession in the United States.<BR>

<P>

Is the United States more or less secure compared to the situation in the 1970s? Greater diversification of import sources, the existence of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a more efficient global market, the emergence of futures markets, and the removal of harmful price and allocation controls suggest that the United States is less vulnerable to the economic damages of supply disruptions than was the case 20 years ago. However, other indicators-the increasing concentration of global oil from potentially unstable regions, domestic consumption patterns, and production trends-imply that unstable global energy markets may still compromise our economic and national security goals.<BR>

<P>

<H4><a name="2.5">Alternative Energy Futures</H4></a>

 

The trends that are shaping the Nation's energy future suggest that we face substantial challenges in meeting our economic, environmental, and national security goals. These trends also indicate that the Nation has found ways to improve energy productivity, prevent pollution, and enhance national security.<BR>

<P>

The Administration's energy policy is not predicated on a single projection of our energy future. Instead, it is based on an appraisal of risks and opportunities evident in current patterns of energy development, and it focuses on areas where the opportunities to reduce risks are greatest.<BR>

<P>

The major risks that threaten the attainment of our national goals include rapid growth in global energy demand, unstable world oil supplies, growing recognition of international environmental threats, and a slowdown in investments to develop and deploy new energy technologies. These trends could lead to the following scenarios:

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Growth in U.S. and world energy demand could strain the capacity of energy suppliers to expand production, resulting in sustained energy price increases. Midrange projections of growth in world energy demand generally assume that economic growth continues at about 2 percent annually in industrialized countries, with nonindustrialized countries growing about 3 to 4 percent annually. But growth during 1993 and 1994 exceeded these rates in most parts of the world. If such growth persists, world energy supplies could become tight within the next decade.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>International conflict or social turmoil in unstable oil-producing regions could disrupt global oil markets and rapidly increase oil prices. Continuing political and social upheaval in the Middle East, Central Asia, and Africa could lead to significant and prolonged disruptions in the ability or willingness of the countries in these regions to supply oil to the international market. Resulting high oil prices, combined with inadequate monetary and fiscal policy responses in industrialized nations, could impair U.S. and global economic growth.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Clear evidence of significant global climate changes or other energy-related environmental problems could precipitate widespread public demand for more stringent measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental risks from energy production and use. Many scientists believe that stronger evidence could emerge in the next decade or two indicating that human-induced climate changes would result in large adverse impacts. Although it is difficult to forecast how the international community would respond, nations that are less dependent on carbon-intensive fuels or that have developed and begun to deploy the technologies needed to reduce such dependence are likely to have an advantage.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

<BLOCKQUOTE>Reduced investments in developing and deploying advanced energy technologies could place the United States at a competitive disadvantage in global energy technology markets. Such a trend could result from the relatively low overall rate of private savings and investment in the United States or from less research and development (R&D) investment in the energy sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 

These risks are evident in current trends, but are not forecasts of future events. Plausible scenarios of energy futures bracket a range of possibilities. Scenarios can be envisioned in which energy risks threaten our economy, environment, and national security, while equally plausible scenarios emphasize the positive trends that could reduce risks over time. The four scenarios describe the dominant risks evident in current trends, which provide the fundamental motivations for Administration energy policy. By focusing national energy policy on the most prevalent risks, the Administration's energy policy enhances the prospects for a clean, competitive, affordable, and secure energy future.
