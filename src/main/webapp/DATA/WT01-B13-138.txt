<P>
As a result of the strength of final demand and rundown of inventories
which occurred during the first quarter, the majority of American
forecasters will soon be projecting 3.0-4.0% output growth during
the second quarter.  The great unresolved question which still
hangs over the financial markets is whether final demand will
slacken again and cause output growth to dip back into the 1.0-2.0%
range during the third quarter or whether output growth will remain
in the 3.0-3.5% range as a result of robust capital investment,
steady expansion of retail sales and a burst of discretionary
federal spending during the closing months of the 1996 fiscal
year.  <B>The economy's performance during the third quarter will
be of critical importance to investor psychology this summer because
it will probably determine whether the Federal Reserve decides
to hike short-term interest rates.</B>  The Fed can avoid tightening
in response to one strong quarter because output growth has been
weak or erratic for over a year.  But with the unemployment rate
at 5.4%, inflation already under upward pressure because of  oil
and food price shocks, and the stock market seemingly oblivious
to all risks, it will be difficult to avoid at least one modest
monetary tightening  at either the early July or late August FOMC
meeting.
<P>
The American forecasting community expects the second quarter
to represent the growth peak of 1996 but there is no consensus
about the growth rate for the second half.  Pessimists believe
that the economy will loose growth momentum quickly because of
the adverse effect of higher oil and food prices on consumer real
income, the impact of rising bond yields on demand for housing
and a general slowdown in business fixed investment after two
years of robust gains.  There will probably also be a sharp rise
of imports and deterioration of the trade account because of inventory
restocking in many tradable goods sectors.
<P>
The growth optimists accept that retail spending will slow and
that the trade deficit will widen but they still project output
growth to remain in excess of 3.0% because of robust business
investment, steady growth of residential construction, a large
swing in corporate demand for inventories and a rebound in government
expenditures as federal agencies rush to spend unexpected appropriations
provided by the budget compromise announced a few weeks ago. 
Under the new budget, federal agencies will be able to engage
in $291 billion of discretionary spending during the April to
September period compared to $244 billion during the first half
of the current fiscal year.
<P>
<B>Several recent economic data reports have strengthened the
arguments of the optimists.</B>  The latest Manpower Employment
Survey is projecting a moderate uptick of employment growth during
the second quarter and is optimistic about the third quarter as
well.  In April, non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft
enjoyed their strongest growth rate in several months.  The recent
decline in oil prices suggests that consumer inflation will ease
during the summer while the year on year growth rate of the CPI
has run so far ahead of the consumption deflator that real household
income is not as weak as the CPI may suggest.  The resilience
of the stock market continues to boost household wealth and is
having positive spillover effects on sectors of the economy sensitive
to discretionary spending.  The government also appears to have
enjoyed a surprisingly large windfall in capital gains tax receipts
during April while America's charities report that personal contributions
to them rose by 11% last year or the highest growth rate since
1986.  Nor is the stock market boom just increasing household
wealth.  <B>It also is boosting investment and job creation by
increasing the flow of capital to entrepreneurial firms through
initial public offerings.  In the first half of 1996, IPO activity
appears likely to expand at a $60 billion annual rate compared
to $29.7 billion last year and a previous peak of $41.7 billion
during 1993.</B>
<P>
Despite the allegations of many economic commentators that Federal
Reserve policy is restrictive, the growth of IPO activity as well
as bank lending to small and medium sized companies makes it clear
that the overall financial environment is quite stimulative. 
Commercial banks enjoy strong balance sheets and are competing
to make new loans.  The mutual fund boom is encouraging an upsurge
in securitized capital formation through new stock and bond issues.
 Investors are more willing to assume risks because they have
enjoyed healthy capital gains on their existing equity portfolios.
 <B>In fact, the ratio of stock market capitalization to GDP has
itself expanded to 90.4% or the highest level ever recorded in
American history.</B>  The previous all time peak was 81% in 1929
and the post-war peak was 78% in 1972.  As a result of healthy
profit growth in the corporate sector since 1991, the stock market's
p/e multiple is still at moderate levels (16 using 1996 profits)
but the ratios of price to book value and price to replacement
cost (Tobin's Q) have risen to record levels.  Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan has downplayed the significance of these
ratios by stressing that book value cannot adequately measure
the impact of America's investment in technology and human capital
on potential corporate earnings power  but the fact remains that
firms are enjoying such rich valuation ratios that they have a
very strong incentive to boost investment.  <B>As a result, it
is not surprising that the most distinguishing feature of the
current business cycle has been its supply side dimension.</B>
 The economy enjoyed a healthy recovery after 1993 because of
an upsurge of capital investment which is causing the economy's
potential manufacturing capacity to expand at a 4.5% annual rate
compared to 2.0-2.5% in the early 1990's.  A recovery with such
strong investment leadership enjoys self-reinforcing momentum
because it boosts the economy's potential growth rate and thus
lowers the risk of inflation even as demand increases. The problem
for policy-makers is that official output data does not yet show
any productivity pay-off from the recent investment boom, so they
continue to perceive the economy's optimal growth rate to be only
about 2.0-2.5%.
<P>
There is not yet a consensus at the Federal Reserve on the need
to tighten monetary policy, but opinion will move in that direction
if May and June data confirm that final demand is expanding at
a steady rate and that the manufacturing sector is shifting from
a sub-cycle of inventory liquidation to accumulation.  Excluding
food and oil, the economy's inflation performance is still excellent
but if output growth remains above 3.0% through year end, the
unemployment rate will drop to 5.0% and provoke increasing anxiety
about the danger of increased pressure on wages and prices.  The
risk of tightening will fade only if there is such pronounced
weakness in retail sales that the FOMC can ignore the resilience
of other sectors or if there is a sudden precipitous correction
in equity prices.
<P>
Political factors could delay any new Fed tightening until August.
 The Senate has not yet been able to confirm the reappointment
of Alan Greenspan as Fed Chairman or the appointment of two new
Governors because of a filibuster by Senator Harkin of Iowa. 
The two new appointees may also be reluctant to launch their Fed
careers by tightening immediately.  But if third quarter growth
forecasts solidify in the 3.0-3.5% range, there will be at least
a 75% chance of monetary tightening at the August FOMC meeting.
<P>
<B>The other factor which could encourage U.S. monetary tightening
and depress bond markets this summer is the growing confidence
among forecasters that 1997 will be the most robust year for the
world economy since 1988.</B>  According to the latest IMF forecast,
world output should expand by 4.3% during 1998 compared to 3.8%
this year, 3.5% during 1995, and 1.5-2.4% during the early 1990's.
 As a result of its below consensus forecast of only 1.8% and
2.2% U.S. output growth during 1996 and 1997, the IMF is projecting
just 2.0% and 2.6% output growth in all the industrial countries
during this year and next year, but it expects output growth in
the developing countries to rise to 6.4% from 6.3% during 1995
and 5.9% during 1995.  The countries in transition from communism
also should enjoy growth rates of 2.5% and 3.8% during 1995 and
1996 compared to large output losses during the early 1990's.
  As the IMF is significantly undersestimating U.S. output growth,
the world economy should enjoy a growth rate in excess of 4.0%
this year and over 4.5% next year.
<P>
Most Wall Street people still view the world economy largely from
the perspective of the G-7 countries but the fact is they now
account for only about 55% of world output compared to 40% for
the developing countries and 5% for the transition economies.
 As a result of the high growth differentials between the developing
countries and industrial countries, the  G-7 share of world output
will decline steadily during the next decade.  The fact is the
developing countries have about 70% of the world's land area and
85% of its population compared to 45% of its output and 15% of
its stock market capitalization.  The gaps between human resources
and output should decline significantly as the developing countries
continue their transition to market oriented economic systems.
