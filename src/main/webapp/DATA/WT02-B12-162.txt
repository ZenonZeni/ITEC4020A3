Ethnic Voting in 1996</h2>

<ul>


<p>

Recently-naturalized US citizens voted overwhelmingly for Clinton in

November 1996.  An estimated 71 percent of Hispanics voted for Clinton.<p>

In California, Texas and Arizona, Latinos voted for Clinton in higher

percentages than the general population of those states.  Only in tipping

Arizona to Clinton, however, does the Latino vote appear to have made a

critical difference.  In Florida, Dole won the Latino vote, but Clinton won the

state.<p>

Most newly naturalized Hispanics--about 61 percent in one survey--are

registered Democrats.  Once registered as Democrats, Latinos rarely switch

party affiliation.  Nine percent of US Latinos registered as Republicans and 30

percent as Independents.  However, it should be noted that younger Hispanics in

the southwest are increasingly registering as Republicans.<p>

On December 27, 1996, the Los Angeles Times reported that at least 19

non-US citizens voted in the close race between Republican Robert K. Dornan and

Democrat Loretta Sanchez for a House seat.  Sanchez won by 984 votes.  The

Sanchez victory is often cited as evidence of the growing importance of the

Hispanic vote.  Dornan has filed a complaint with the House of Representatives

contesting the results of the election.<p>

It is a felony under California law for a non-US citizen to vote or

register to vote.  Those who acknowledged voting before being sworn in as US

citizens were taking naturalization classes at Hermanda Mexicana Nacional, a

Santa Ana organization that registered least 916 people to vote, most just

before the November 5, 1996 election.  <p>

If an applicant brings evidence of passing an English and civics class from

an organization such as Hermanda, the INS examiner normally does not ask many

civics questions during the mandatory interview.  INS examiners, who conducted

some interviews in the Hermanda office, immediately tell the applicant whether

they passed the test, but also tell applicants they are not citizens until they

are sworn in.  Voter registration is done on the honor system.<p>

About 53 percent of Asian-Pacific voters voted for Clinton and 40 percent

for Dole.  About 60 percent of the Asian-Americans were born abroad.<p>

Some spokesman for ethnic and immigrant rights organizations say that

immigration restrictions, welfare cuts and Proposition 209 woke a sleeping

giant of Hispanic and Asian voters.  For most voters, however, immigration was

not the decisive factor in determining how to vote.  A poll of 1,200 US voters

found that fewer than one percent based their vote on the candidates'

immigration position.  <p>

One indirect effect of immigration that may have influenced some election

outcomes is the tendency of native-born whites to move away from

high-immigration areas.  Some observers speculate, for example, that Jesse

Helms (R-NC) won re-election to the US Senate in part because of the influx of

whites from New York and Florida.<p>
