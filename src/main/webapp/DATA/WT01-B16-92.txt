<H3>The Nuclear Fuel Market of the Next Century. <A HREF="http://www.uilondon.org/uiabs95/clarkbio.html">R. Gene Clark</A>.</H3>
<P>
The market in 1995 is reviewed: firstly, nuclear power programmes worldwide are stagnant
except in Asia. Secondly trade restrictions in Euratom countries and the US against imports of
uranium and SWU from former Soviet Union countries have resulted in a segmented market, with
market prices lower for those countries who accept nuclear fuel products from this region. Thirdly
the market impact of Russian HEU from dismantled weapons could be significant, and fourthly
the market effect of the NUEXCO bankruptcy must be considered.<P>

Next the market in 2005 is envisioned, after a brief comparison with 1985. Nuclear power
worldwide will either be phasing out or in resurgence, depending on its progress in both
economics and acceptance. Its share in developing countries will depend upon their ability to
finance construction. In trade regulation, US suspension agreements with Russia, Kazakhstan and
Uzbekistan will have ended, releasing former Soviet Union uranium onto the market - smoothly
in the author's opinion. HEU will have greater market impact, and will be at the level inherent in
the current contract with USEC, though who will be selling it is uncertain. By 2005 Russian-
owned natural uranium will be on the market, released at a level tied to the HEU deal. 2005 will
see  uranium production increased to approximately 1985 levels, from active projects in Canada,
Australia, US, Africa, China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and others; from HEU; from potential new
capacity in Australia and Canada; and from marginally competitive production sources. There will
be a healthy competitive situation, no technical shortfalls in supply, and no great extra production
capacity. Enrichment will see the beginning of new technologies, and emerging suppliers.<P>

The market in 2015 is harder to predict, being beyond the expected lifetime of most operating
plants and mines. Comparison is made with 20 years ago. By 2015 nuclear must either be on an
upsurge or well into phase-out; there can be no middle ground. The author hopes for the former
scenario but cannot predict it with certainty. Conditions necessary for a resurgence are a new
reactor technology and resolution of the waste disposal issue. The major uranium producers will be
those with reasonably assured resources in excess of 150000 tonnes U<SMALL><SUB>3</SUB>
</SMALL>O<SMALL><SUB>8</SMALL></SUB>,  Australia, Kazakhstan, Canada, South  Africa,
Uzbekistan, Russia, Brazil and Niger. Enrichment technology will have replaced gaseous diffusion
 with centrifuge, and possibly newer technologies, giving lower tails assays. The Russia-US HEU
 contract will be in its last year, but
commercial-grade nuclear fuel from warheads will still be playing a key market role.<P>
