sizes of the two principal strata, the ILZ and the ELZ, used to
divide the continent.

<A HREF="chap2a.htm#table2">Table 2:</A> A summary description
of the 34 landcover types derived from the original 230 categories
of the Natural Vegetation dataset of AUSLIG (1990). The figure
in brackets under the Code symbol is the percentage projected
foliage cover (pfc).
<P>
<A HREF="chap2a.htm#table3">Table 3: </A>A statistical summary
of the 34 landcover types that were the basic ecological strata
for this study. The nature and severity of disturbance are determined
for each strata within the Intensive and Extensive Landuse Zones.
The areas are in km2. The most extensive landcover type in each
zone (rank 1) is underlined.

AUSLIG tenures into six groups that offer different levels of
protection against future landcover disturbance.

classes of clearing disturbance aggregated for the Intensive landuse
Zone (ILZ) and for the continent.

<A HREF="chap3a.htm#table6">Table 6:</A> A summary of the relative
distribution (%) of clearing within each landcover type. The grasslands
(xG) and low shrublands (xZ2) were excluded. The index Loss was
the sum of the cleared and thinned classes.

<A HREF="chap4b.htm#table13">Table 13:</A> A summary of the areas
(km2) in each of the three key disturbance classes for each of
the landcover types of the ILZ. The index Loss was calculated
as the percentage of the total area of each landcover type that
was thinned and cleared. The disturbance score was assigned thus:
no clearing (-); &lt;10% (*); 11-30% (**); &gt;31% (***).

moderate (**); &gt;100 was high (***).

<A HREF="chap4d.htm#table15">Table 15:</A> The distribution of
relative area (%) of the six tenure levels for all landcover types
within the ILZ and ELZ. The score was based on the mean sum of
the products of the percentage areas and the tenure protection
ratings that are lowest with tenure type 1 and highest with tenure
type 6.
