<h1>COMMENTS SUBMITTED FOR NIST KEY ESCROW WORKSHOP REPORT</h1>


<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.  I am Shabbir J.
Safdar from the VTW (Voters Telecommunications Watch).  VTW is a public
advocacy organization based in New York City.  We monitor civil
liberties issues in telecommunications for the public and when civil
liberties coincides with good business practices, small business
interests.
<p>

There are a number of problems with the key escrow proposals (both
Clipper and Commercial Key Escrow) that have been put before us.  Today I
will be addressing some of the problems with the current proposal and
exploring some myths surrounding the debate.

<p>
TRUE OR FALSE?

<p>
True or False: Industry is clamoring for key escrow

<p>
True.  Industry is not, however, clamoring to put their keys in the hands of
disinterested third parties.

<p>
True or False: Export controls are preventing foreign adversaries from
obtaining commercial cryptographic technology

<p>
This is true if we're speaking of US commercial cryptographic technology,
but false if we’re speaking about the hundreds of products available
overseas.  As recently as this year Colombia declared a state of
emergency and used that opportunity to conduct a number of raids on
suspected Cali Cartel offices.  They found that Cartel members were using
encryption to hide stored data files containing counter-intelligence
information, encryption devices to hide their real time communications,
and were also conducting their own surveillance program on the Colombian
law enforcement’s communications.
<p>

Presumably, they did not have a warrant.

<p>
(References for this incident can be found in the May 26th 1995 Wall
Street Journal cover story and the July 3, 1995 Baltimore Sun.)

<p>

True or False: Export controls are preventing foreign adversaries from
obtaining public domain cryptographic technology

<p>
False.  The availability of public domain PGP overseas is currently a
somewhat tired but true joke within forums such as this one.  In addition,
the newest product in the PGP family, PGPFone, was released for download
on the Internet for US and Canadian sites only.  With explicit warnings and
annoying measures in place, it clearly informed the user (who could not
download it without being on a site within the US or Canada) that export
of PGPFone outside the US violated ITAR.
<p>

PGPFone was available on a European server three days and four hours
later.
<p>


Issues raised by the use of key escrow agents

<p>
OVERSIGHT
<p>
Because the event of releasing a key is in and of itself secret, it is very
difficult for an insider within the escrow structure to report wrongdoing
without compromising their knowledge of an investigation.

<p>
As we know from experience, oversight of a secret government process
does not work adequately to engender public trust.

<p>
NO EVIDENCE OF A MARKET ABROAD FOR ESCROWED PRODUCTS
<p>
There is no evidence that suggests that there is a market abroad for
commercial key escrow products.  Contrary to the statements and
optimism of the fine gentleman from the White House, it is unlikely that
China will allow its citizenry to use communications products it cannot
wiretap.
<p>

Considering that these people have first-hand experience with a tyrannical
regime and it potential for damage, it is unlikely that Chinese dissidents
will use key escrowed devices knowing that they can be accessed by the
government.
<p>

DAMAGE STEMMING FROM A WRONGFUL DISCLOSURE IS TOO HIGH
<p>
The damages an escrow agent might be responsible for in the case of a
wrongful key release is going to be greater than anyone can afford. 
Imagine the amount of money that is involved in a campaign, a new patent,
a new pharmaceutical drug, or a financial acquisition.  Who can afford to
be liable for such damages?
<p>

DOCUMENTS LIVE FOREVER UNDER KEY ESCROW
<p>
The escrow agents can never be allowed to destroy a key, because you can
never prove that you have stopped using a key.  This means that if your
traditional records management system involves destroying an encrypted
document and its decryption keys after seven years.

<p>
Under commercial key escrow you will now have to worry about the
existence of any document or communication forever because there will
always be a decryption key available.  In addition, because people tend to
be less careful with transmission and storage of encrypted documents
(because, after all they're encrypted) the likelihood of someone having
made a rogue copy is more likely than under a non-key escrowed
encryption system where you would have used a Brinks-mailed floppy disk
instead of an open-line transfer.
<p>

ESCROW AGENTS CANNOT ENFORCE CONSTRAINTS OF THE WARRANT
<p>
Because law enforcement agents are not involved in the collection of the
seized material, they cannot verify that when they are presented with a
warrant, that the officers in question acted in a manner appropriate to the
judge's orders.  Escrow agents are then reduced to nothing more than
safety deposit box services.  Although this might meet the needs of law
enforcement, this does not support the requirement of trust between the
public and the escrow agent.
<p>

VOLUNTARY KEY ESCROW IS NOT CREDIBLE
<p>
Although the word voluntary has been bandied about publicly throughout
the Administration's key escrow debacle, the FBI, the NSA, and the
Department of Justice have all stated in documents obtained through the
Freedom of Information Act that for key escrow to work, other forms of
non-escrowed cryptography must be criminalized.  Although this is no
surprise to anyone who has thought about the problem, this casts doubt on
the Administration’s commitment to the continued availability of other
forms of cryptography.  These documents can be found on the Electronic
Privacy Information Center World Wide Web site at URL:http://www.epic.org.

<p>
In addition, the very fact that escrowed products are going to enjoy
preferential export treatment (64 bits versus 40 bits), indicates that a
choice between escrowed and non-escrowed products is not a voluntary
choice, but one weighted with inappropriate incentives.
<p>

WIRETAP ABUSES DO OCCUR
<p>
Although it gives us no joy to point it out, throughout recent history there
have been cases of abuses of surveillance authority.  It makes no sense to
empower an already human-fallible system with additional powers such
that the magnitude and damage of the human errors is increased.

<p>
EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS AN INAPPROPRIATE LOCATION FOR BOTH ESCROW
AGENTS AND ESCROW AGENTS' REGULATORY AGENCIES
<p>
The regulatory structure that has been discussed so far involves the
regulation of escrow agents solely by the Executive Branch.  Thus far no
one has suggested that legislation is necessary, though many have
suggested that it might be an alternative.
<p>

Should final regulatory authority rest entirely within the Executive
Branch, escrow agents would be subject to the political whims of
whatever the current administration felt was appropriate.   A process that
does not have an appeals escape clause (one that allows you to predict the
number of appeals you will have to file and when you will be appealing to
a judicial body) can arbitrarily control the actions of escrow agents.

<p>
Without a judicial appeals process that goes outside the executive
branch, a key escrow agent or a key escrow customer will end up appealing
to the very same agency that is a party to any dispute.


<p>
CONCLUSION
<p>
It is an interesting game that we play here today with extremely high
stakes.  We continually fight over what some call the "grey area" of access
to data and communications.  Public advocates assert that law
enforcement enjoys significant access to data already, but that a
guarantee of access to data is not acceptable.

<p>
Law enforcement insists that the public has significant ability to keep
data confidential, but that a guarantee of confidentiality is not
acceptable.

<p>
It is not clear if there is a middle ground where both these parties can
find solace, but key escrow (either commercial key escrow or through
government held keys) is not that middle ground.
