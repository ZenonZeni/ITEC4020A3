<P>



<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd1.gif" ALT="Now you don't have to try to predict when and how the markets will move."><BR>
<B>"Buy low, sell high."</B> So easy to say, but not so easy to do.  In reality, many investors find it tough to resist the natural temptation to pull out of the market when prices are falling, or to put more money in after a significant rally.
<P>
And many more investors, concerned that they have to get it <I>right</I>&#160; to hit it <I>big</I>, spend so long waiting for the "right time" to get into the market that they never do invest.  They let their fears about market fluctuations deny them the outstanding performance opportunities provided by stocks.


<P><BR>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd2.gif" ALT="A strategy to make market fluctuation  work for you."><BR>
There is a way to help reduce the risk of investing at the wrong time and actually take advantage of the ups and downs of the stock market.  It's a simple strategy that proves timing isn't everything.  It's called <B>dollar cost averaging</B>.
<P>
While <B>dollar cost averaging</B> can help protect you from buying only at the absolute worst time, it cannot guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.  But if you have the patience to ride out the tough times and stick to your regular investing schedule, there are definite advantages to dollar cost averaging.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd3.gif" ALT="Invest regular amounts at regular intervals - and stick to your plan."><BR>
With <B>dollar cost averaging</B>, you make smaller investments at regular intervals over a period of time, instead of a large, one-time investment.  The investment amount and frequency are up to you (for instance, $200 each week, $500 each month, or $1,000 every three months).
<P>
Successful <B>dollar cost averaging</B> requires that you stick to your plan, regardless of what the market does.  Make sure you select an amount that is consistent with your financial means, so that you can continue to purchase shares even through periods of low share prices.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd4.gif" ALT="How does dollar cost averaging work?"><BR>
It's simpler than you might expect.

<P>

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd5.gif" ALT="Pay a lower cost per share."><BR>
Since you invest the same dollar amount each period, you automatically purchase more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high.  This means that, over the entire purchase period, your average cost per share will be lower than the investment's average price per share.  And you have used market fluctuations to your investment advantage.


<P>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd6.gif" ALT="Let's look at some hypothetical examples:"><BR>
You've decided to invest $5,000 in a stock mutual fund, in $1,000 monthly investments over a five-month period.  Let's see how three typical market trends-rising, declining, and fluctuating (up and down)-affect your total investment.
<P>
Note:  The hypothetical share prices used are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to represent the actual prices of any Kemper Fund.


<P><BR>


<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd7.gif" ALT="During a Rising Market"><BR>
In an up market, the best possible time to buy is obviously at the very beginning-the ground floor. But how can you tell exactly when the upswing will start? The truth is, no one can.

<P>
The beauty of <B>dollar cost averaging</B> is that you don't need a crystal ball to guide your investment plan.
<P>
When the share price drops, you should resist profit-taking -- selling your shares -- and continue your regular $1,000 investments.
<PRE>
<B>  Regular   Share  Shares</B>
<B> Investment Price Acquired</B>
   $1,000      $ 5      200
   $1,000      $ 6      167
   $1,000      $ 7      143
   $1,000      $ 6      167
   $1,000      $ 9      111
  ___________________________
<B>  $5,000     $33    788</B>
</PRE>
How did you do? With <B>dollar cost averaging</B>, you ended up with 788 shares worth $7,092. That's a 42% gain on your original $5,000 investment.
<P>
<B>Average Share Cost: $6.35</B><BR>
($5,000/788 shares)
<P>
<B>Average Share Price: $6.60</B><BR>
($33/5 purchases)
<P>
And even with continually rising prices, your average cost per share is lower than the average price paid.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd8.gif" ALT="During a Declining Market"><BR>
Let's look at how <B>dollar cost averaging</B> can help protect you from buying at the worst time -- the highest price -- during a period of generally declining prices.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_declining.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
While <B>dollar cost averaging</B> cannot protect against a loss in a declining market, you purchase more shares at lower prices with each investment.
<P>
If you had committed your entire $5,000 the first month, you'd have received only 1,000 shares worth just $1,000 after 5 months. The price would have to rebound all the way to $5 just to break even...
<PRE>
<B>  Regular   Share  Shares</B>
<B> Investment Price Acquired</B>
   $1,000      $ 5      200
   $1,000      $ 3      333
   $1,000      $ 3      333
   $1,000      $ 2      500
   $1,000      $ 1     1000
  ___________________________
<B>  $5,000    $14*   2,366</B>
</PRE>
...But your five monthly $1,000 investments purchased a total of 2,366 shares that, at the final price, are worth $2,366.
<P>
<B>Average Share Cost: $2.11</B><BR>
($5,000/2,366 shares)
<P>
<B>Average Share Price: $2.80</B><BR>
($14/5 purchases)
<P>
By <B>dollar cost averaging</B> you automatically bought more shares at attractive low prices. And any recovery beyond your average share cost -- $2.11 -- puts you back in the black and in great shape to benefit from future appreciation opportunities.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd9.gif" ALT="During an Up-and-Down Market"><BR>
During an up-and-down market, you purchase shares when prices are high, low, and in between. Can <B>dollar cost averaging</B> still work?
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_updown.gif">
</CENTER>
<P>
With <B>dollar cost averaging</B>, you can use market fluctuations to your own investment advantage, even when share prices go up and down.
<P>
By <B>dollar cost averaging</B> your investment, you always bought fewer shares when the price was high and more shares when the price was low.
<PRE>
<B>  Regular   Share  Shares</B>
<B> Investment Price Acquired</B>
   $1,000      $ 5      200

<B>  $5,000    $25*   1,076</B>
</PRE>
Thanks to <B>dollar cost averaging</B>, you stayed invested during an uncertain market, ending up with more than 1,000 shares.
<P>
<B>Average Share Cost: $4.65</B><BR>
($5,000/1,076 shares)
<P>
<B>Average Share Price: $5.00</B><BR>
($25/5 purchases)
<P>
And even in a fluctuating market, <B>dollar cost averaging</B> results in an average share cost less than your average share price.

<IMG BORDER=0 SRC="gifs/dollarcost_subhd11.gif" ALT="Kemper's Automatic Investing Plans make it easy."><BR>
If you have a significant sum to invest, consider starting a <B>dollar cost averaging </B>program with an investment in a money market or other conservative fixed income fund.*  Then periodically -- and consistently -- exchange (transfer) a set amount into an equity or other higher potential fund. Ask your financial advisor about starting a <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">Kemper Systematic Exchange Plan</A>, a feature that can handle these regular transfers for you automatically.** If you know your representative's e-mail address, <A HREF="mailto:">click here</A> to send him or her an e-mail now.
<P>
If you don't have a lot of money to invest, you may  sign up for one of Kemper's other automatic investing options: <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">Payroll and Government Direct Deposit</A> or <A HREF="../../shareholders/forms.html">Bank Direct Deposit</A>, a feature that lets you invest automatically from your checking or savings account at an Automated Clearing House member bank, savings and loan, or credit union.
