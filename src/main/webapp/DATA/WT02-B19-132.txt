<h1> Special Student </h1>

Students wishing to take graduate courses not for credit 
are admitted as Special Students. The applicants must 
have completed an appropriate four-year Bachelor's 
degree from a recognized university and have attained 
grades of B+ or better. Courses taken as a Special 
Student cannot be counted for credit in a subsequent 
degree program at the University of Toronto.
