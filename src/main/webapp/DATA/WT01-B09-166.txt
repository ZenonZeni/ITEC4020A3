<B>Project Summary:</B>
<P>
&#149; Conduct a system design of a marine propulsion system that
will verify the operating characteristics and performance estimates
of a Midfoil ship design.
<P>
&#149; Based upon the system design, generate a detailed design,
fabricate and integrate the hardware and conduct factory testing.
Install and conduct dockside and atsea testing in the Midfoil
craft.

<B>Project Schedule:</B>
<P>
The project schedule is closely tied to the development of the
Midfoil hull design and subsequent hull fabrication. Those tasks are being conducted outside
of the DARPA Electric and Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technology Program as part of a DARPA
and CEROS marine initiative. The current schedule is to install the propulsion
equipment in the Midfoil in the Fall/Winter 1996 time frame and start testing in Hawaiian waters
in early 1997.
