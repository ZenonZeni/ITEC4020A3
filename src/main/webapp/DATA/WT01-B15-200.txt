[42 U.S.C. 10192]
<H4><A NAME="SEC213">IDENTIFICATION OF SITES</A></H4>

<P>
Sec. 213. (a) Guidelines. Not later than 6 months after the date
of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983] and notwithstanding
the failure of other agencies to promulgate standards pursuant
to applicable law, the Secretary, in consultation with the Commission,
the Director of the Geological Survey, the Administrator, the
Council on Environmental Quality, and such other Federal agencies
as the Secretary considers appropriate, is authorized to issue,
pursuant to section 553 of title 5, United States Code [5 U.S.C.
553], general guidelines for the selection of a site for a test
and evaluation facility. Under such guidelines the Secretary shall
specify factors that qualify or disqualify a site for development
as a test and evaluation facility, including factors pertaining
to the location of valuable natural resources, hydrogeophysics,
seismic activity, and atomic energy defense activities, proximity
to water supplies, proximity to populations, the effect upon the
rights of users of water, and proximity to components of the National
Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National
Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Wilderness Preservation
System, or National Forest Lands. Such guidelines shall require
the Secretary to consider the various geologic media in which
the site for a test and evaluation facility may be located and,
to the extent practicable, to identify sites in different geologic
media. The Secretary shall use guidelines established under this
subsection in considering and selecting sites under this title
[42 U.S.C. 10191 et seq.].
<P>
(b) Site identification by the Secretary.
<P>
(1) Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this
Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], and following promulgation of guidelines
under subsection (a), the Secretary is authorized to identify
3 or more sites, at least 2 of which shall be in different geologic
media in the continental United States, and at least 1 of which
shall be in media other than salt. Subject to Commission requirements,
the Secretary shall give preference to sites for the test and
evaluation facility in media possessing geochemical characteristics
that retard aqueous transport of radionuclides. In order to provide
a greater possible protection of public health and safety as operating
experience is gained at the test and evaluation facility, and
with the exception of the primary areas under review by the Secretary
on the date of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983]
for the location of a test and evaluation facility or repository,
all sites identified under this subsection shall be more than
15 statute miles from towns having a population of greater than
1,000 persons as determined by the most recent census unless such
sites contain high-level radioactive waste prior to identification
under this title [42 U.S.C. 10191 et seq.]. Each identification
of a site shall be supported by an environmental assessment, which
shall include a detailed statement of the basis for such identification
and of the probable impacts of the siting research activities
planned for such site, and a discussion of alternative activities
relating to siting research that may be undertaken to avoid such
impacts. Such environmental assessment shall include
<P>
(A) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is
suitable for siting research under the guidelines established
under subsection (a);
<P>
(B) an evaluation by the Secretary of the effects of the siting
research activities at such site on the public health and safety
and the environment;
<P>
(C) a reasonable comparative evaluation by the Secretary of such
site with other sites and locations that have been considered;
<P>
(D) a description of the decision process by which such site was
recommended; and
<P>
(E) an assessment of the regional and local impacts of locating
the proposed test and evaluation facility at such site.
<P>
(2) When the Secretary identifies a site, the Secretary shall
as soon as possible notify the Governor of the State in which
such site is located, or the governing body of the affected Indian
tribe where such site is located, of such identification and the
basis of such identification. Additional sites for the location
of the test and evaluation facility authorized in section 302(d)
[42 U.S.C. 10222(d)] may be identified after such 1 year period,
following the same procedure as if such sites had been identified
within such period.

<H4><A NAME="SEC217">RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON DISPOSAL OF HIGH-LEVEL
RADIOACTIVE WASTE</A></H4>

<P>
Sec. 217. (a) Purpose. Not later than 64 months after the date
of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], the Secretary
is authorized to, to the extent practicable, begin at a site evaluated
under section 214 [42 U.S.C. 10194], as part of and as an extension
of siting research activities of such site under such section
[42 U.S.C. 10194], the mining and construction of a test and evaluation
facility. Prior to the mining and construction of such facility,
the Secretary shall prepare an environmental assessment. The purpose
of such facility shall be
<P>
(1) to supplement and focus the repository site characterization
process;
<P>
(2) to provide the conditions under which known technological
components can be integrated to demonstrate a functioning repository-like
system;
<P>
(3) to provide a means of identifying, evaluating, and resolving
potential repository licensing issues that could not be resolved
during the siting research program under section 212 [42 U.S.C.
10192];
<P>
(4) to validate, under actual conditions, the scientific models
used in the design of a repository;
<P>
(5) to refine the design and engineering of repository components
and systems and to confirm the predicted behavior of such components
and systems;
<P>
(6) to supplement the siting data, the generic and specific geological
characteristics developed under section 214 [42 U.S.C. 10194]
relating to isolating disposal materials in the physical environment
of a repository;
<P>
(7) to evaluate the design concepts for packaging, handling, and
emplacement of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear
fuel at the design rate; and
<P>
(8) to establish operating capability without exposing workers
to excessive radiation.
<P>
(b) Design. The Secretary shall design each test and evaluation
facility
<P>
(1) to be capable of receiving not more than 100 full-sized canisters
of solidified high-level radioactive waste (which canisters shall
not exceed an aggregate weight of 100 metric tons), except that
spent nuclear fuel may be used instead of such waste if such waste
cannot be obtained under reasonable conditions;
<P>
(2) to permit full retrieval of solidified high-level radioactive
waste, or other radioactive material used by the Secretary for
testing, upon completion of the technology demonstration activities;
and
<P>
(3) based upon the principle that the high-level radioactive waste,
spent nuclear fuel, or other radioactive material involved shall
be isolated from the biosphere in such a way that the initial
isolation is provided by engineered barriers functioning as a
system with the geologic environment.
<P>
(c) Operation.
<P>
(1) Not later than 88 months after the date of the enactment of
this Act [enacted Jan. 7, 1983], the Secretary shall begin an
in situ testing program at the test and evaluation facility in
accordance with the mission plan developed under section 301 [42
U.S.C. 10221], for purposes of
<P>
(A) conducting in situ tests of bore hole sealing, geologic media
fracture sealing, and room closure to establish the techniques
and performance for isolation of high-level radioactive waste,
spent nuclear fuel, or other radioactive materials from the biosphere;
<P>
(B) conducting in situ tests with radioactive sources and materials
to evaluate and improve reliable models for radionuclide migration,
absorption, and containment within the engineered barriers and
geologic media involved, if the Secretary finds there is reasonable
assurance that such radioactive sources and materials will not
threaten the use of such site as a repository;
<P>
(C) conducting in situ tests to evaluate and improve models for
ground water or brine flow through fractured geologic media;
<P>
(D) conducting in situ tests under conditions representing the
real time and the accelerated time behavior of the engineered
barriers within the geologic environment involved;
<P>
(E) conducting in situ tests to evaluate the effects of heat and
pressure on the geologic media involved, on the hydrology of the
surrounding area, and on the integrity of the disposal packages;
<P>
(F) conducting in situ tests under both normal and abnormal repository
conditions to establish safe design limits for disposal packages
and to determine the effects of the gross release of radionuclides
into surroundings, and the effects of various credible failure
modes, including
<P>
(i) seismic events leading to the coupling of aquifers through
the test and evaluation facility;
<P>
(ii) thermal pulses significantly greater than the maximum calculated;
and
<P>
(iii) human intrusion creating a direct pathway to the biosphere.
<P>
(G) conducting such other research and development activities
as the Secretary considers appropriate, including such activities
necessary to obtain the use of high-level radioactive waste, spent
nuclear fuel, or other radioactive materials (such as any highly
radioactive material from the Three Mile Island nuclear powerplant
or from the West Valley Demonstration Project) for test and evaluation
purposes, if such other activities are reasonably necessary to
support the repository program and if there is reasonable assurance
that the radioactive sources involved will not threaten the use
of such site as a repository.
<P>
(2) The in situ testing authorized in this subsection shall be
designed to ensure that the suitability of the site involved for
licensing by the Commission as a repository will not be adversely
affected.
<P>
(d) Use of existing Department facilities. During the conducting
of siting research activities under section 214 [42 U.S.C. 10194]
and for such period thereafter as the Secretary considers appropriate,
the Secretary shall use Department facilities owned by the Federal
Government on the date of the enactment of this Act [enacted Jan.
7, 1983] for the conducting of generically applicable tests regarding
packaging, handling, and emplacement technology for solidified
high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel from civilian
nuclear activities.
<P>
(e) Engineered barriers. The system of engineered barriers and
selected geology used in a test and evaluation facility shall
have a design life at least as long as that which the Commission
requires by regulations issued under this Act [42 U.S.C. 10101
et seq.], or under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2011
et seq.], for repositories.
<P>
(f) Role of Commission.
