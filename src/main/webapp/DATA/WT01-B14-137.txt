<H2>The Role of Air-Sea Exchanges and Ocean Circulation in Climate Variability</H2><P>
<B>Principal Investigator</B> - <I> <A HREF="liu.html"> W. Timothy Liu </A> </I><P>

<H2>Perspective</H2>

  The ocean is forced at the surface largely through the exchanges of water,
momentum, and heat.  Without surface forcing, the ocean would just be a
dead pool of water.  The exchanges drive the transport and change the
storage of heat, water, and greenhouse gases and thus moderate the world's
climate.  The ocean feedback to climate changes must be manifested through
these exchanges, without which the Earth would be a more hostile habitat.
We need to study ocean circulation and air-sea exchanges to understand
natural global changes and to discern the anthropogenic effects.<P>

  The ocean is an under-sampled turbulent fluid with non-linear interactions;
processes at one scale affect processes at other scales.  Adequate
observations at significant temporal and spatial scales can only be
achieved from the vantage point of space.  A suite of complementary
spaceborne sensors is needed to unravel the complex processes of
ocean-atmosphere interaction.  Our study will demonstrate that the value of
flying the suite of sensors together continuously far outweighs the sum of
the benefits of flying individual sensor one at a time, the essence of the
<A HREF="http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/spso_homepage.html">EOS.</A> 
Spaceborne sensors, however, cannot probe deep ocean and, therefore,
in situ measurements are also needed.  Ocean general circulation models
have the potential of providing the dynamic interpolation and integration
of these data.  Our study will take advantage of the historic opportunity
created by the advance of computer technology and the maturity of ocean
general circulation models in the era of EOS sensors and data systems.<P>

<H2>Goal</H2>

  To improve diagnosis and prognosis of global changes through the
understanding of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.<P>

<H2>Objectives</H2>

<UL>
<LI> To improve existing and to develop new methodologies for estimating
global ocean-atmosphere fluxes in momentum, energy, water, and carbon
dioxide.

<LI> To study the changes in the transport and storage of heat, water, and
greenhouse gases by the ocean in response to surface forcing.

<LI> To understand the energy and hydrologic balances of the atmosphere and
their relation with ocean surface fluxes.<P>
<BR></UL>

<H2> Strategy</H2>

  The strategy of our investigation evolves over time, but it is be based
largely on the synergistic and interdisciplinary approaches of applying
satellite data, ground-based measurements, and numerical models.<P>
<DL>
<DT> <I>Satellite Observations</I>
<DD> Our team has strong experience in estimating ocean surface forcing using
satellite data.  We are currently using SSMI and AVHRR to estimate
evaporation and latent heat; ISCCP to compute solar irradiance; GPCP
(Global Precipitation Climatology Project) to provide rain; and
scatterometer (ERS1) to derive wind stress.  We are also using altimeter
sea level (from Geosat and Topex), sea surface temperature (from AVHRR) to
study the ocean's dynamic and thermal responses.  In the near future, we
will continue to use operational data from AVHRR, TOVS, SSMI, SSMT2
(humidity sounding), ISCCP, and GPCP; from scatterometers and altimeters on
ERS1 and 2; from SeaWifs (ocean productivity); from NSCAT and OCTS on
ADEOS-1; from TRMM; from GLI and AMSR on ADEOS-2.  We are actively
preparing for the increase in accuracy and resolution of expected EOS
sensors, such as, SeaWinds, ocean altimeter, MIMR, AIRS (MHS), MODIS, CERES
at the turn of the century.<P>

<DT> <I>In Situ Monitoring and Field Campaign</I>
<DD>Our team members have participated in the design of in situ monitoring
programs and the execution of field campaigns for the Tropical Ocean of
Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program and World Ocean Circulation Experiment
(WOCE).  We shall continue in the analysis of data from experiments, such
as, TOGA-COARE (Couple Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment) and are
actively planning and will participate in new programs, such as, the Global
Drifter Program and the Atlantic Climate Change Experiment.<P>
<DT><I>Global Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM)</I>
<DD>Eddy-resolving OGCM with realistic thermodynamics are being studied.
Realistic surface forcing derived from satellite data is being used to
force the OGCM, and the model responses are being compared with
observations both from spaceborne and ground based sensors.  We will learn
to interpret the difference in terms of specific physical processes and
model weakness.  Data assimilation techniques are being vigorously pursued,
both for improving model performance and for interpolation and integration
of data.  Surface flux derived inversely by constraining the model with
data will also be examined.  We plan to extend our study to coupled
ocean-atmosphere models in the future.<P>
