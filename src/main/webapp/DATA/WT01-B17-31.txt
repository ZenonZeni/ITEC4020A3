        Chances are that someone you have known, maybe even a close relative, died an
untimely death because of heart disease.  Such a loss makes one philosophical - you
stop to wonder why things happen the way they do.  Perhaps the loss of that person
has you reflecting on your own health, lifestyle, and inherited predispositions.
<P> You probably know about the strong correlation between heart disease and
cholesterol specifically between coronary heart disease and blood cholesterol
levels.  You may not know, however, that doubt exists concerning the cause
and-effect relationship between the two.  Treatments based on this relationship are
not only ineffective, but often counterproductive.
<P ALIGN="center">
CHOLESTEROL
<BR>
THAT CLOGS YOUR ARTERIES
<BR>
IS JUST AS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN
<BR>
MANUFACTURED
<BR>
BY YOUR OWN BODY.
</P>
        We're told that cholesterol from food finds its way into the interior of
arteries where it builds until it forms a significant barrier to the free
circulation of blood.  But cholesterol is just as likely to have been manufactured
by your own body.  Furthermore, the obstruction begins to develop inside the walls
lining your arteries, not as surface deposits. <P> Some researchers believe that
the presence of cholesterol may even be an attempt to keep your damaged arteries
functioning better.  The source of 
<P ALIGN="center">
THE PRESENCE OF
<BR>
CHOLESTEROL MAY EVEN BE AN
<BR>
ATTEMPT TO KEEP
<BR>
YOUR DAMAGED ARTERIES
<BR>
FUNCTIONING BETTER.
</P>
        damage that leads to heart disease is still elusive, but a few facts are in
place. One promising view, validated by research, holds that in the absence of
vitamin B-6, folic acid, and vitamin B- 12, an important amino acid called
methionine is converted to a substance called homocysteine in much greater than
normal quantities.  Homocysteine has a toxic effect on certain cells in your artery
walls.  Its presence eventually causes the inner walls of your arteries to become
uneven and rough - resulting in an accumulation of unwanted stuff, including
cholesterol.  Having an adequate supply of B-6 (50 mg), B-12 (0.1 mg), and folic
acid (0.4 mg) could be insurance against this process. 

<P> Another critical factor
is the condition of dietary fats and oils.  Naturally-occurring fatty acids have a
particular shape, which changes under the action of beat, oxygen, time, and even
light.  Intentionally manipulating an oil is beneficial for the food manufacturer
(the oil is cheaper and processing takes less time), but the finished product is
foreign to human metabolism - resulting in a debilitating loss of cellular health
for you.  So listing soybean, cottonseed, or corn oil on a label hardly tells the
whole story!  You have no way of knowing how the oil has been altered.  High
amounts of these altered fatty acids are found in cakes, muffins, crackers,
cereals, donuts, precooked french fries, shortenings, potato chips and corn chips. 
Referred to as trans-fatty acids, their introduction began after 1912 ! 2 We now
know that they can injure the lining of your digestive tract by causing
inflammation, in addition to causing heart damage.  Beware foods with trans-fatty
acids. 

<P> Margarine, with a high percentage of these mutated fatty acids but long
promoted as a heartfriendly substitute for butter, has been finally proved to have
the opposite effect - something the nutrition-aware community has known for a long
time.  Now everyone knows that trans-fatty acids are directly related to
heart-disease risk.' The "French paradox"(Iow incidence of coronary heart disease
despite a high intake of total fat in France) is suggested to be due to the limited
use of trans-fats in French foods. 

<P> Your liver manufactures between one and four
grams of cholesterol per day An egg, for comparison, has about one-quarter of a
gram.  So your liver is producing cholesterol equivalent to between four to sixteen
eggs daily - a high cholesterol diet by anyone's standards.  Plus, every cell in
your body (with a few exceptions) can manufacture cholesterol.
<P ALIGN="center">
HAVING AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF B-6
<BR>
(50 MG), B- 1 2 (0.  I MG), AND FOLIC
<BR>
ACID (0.4 MG) COULD BE INSURANCE
<BR>
AGAINST HEART DISEASE.
</P>
        You can see that the route from dietary cholesterol to heart disease is
indirect at best. (For Betty Kamen's paper on the much-maligned egg - why you should
and can eat them - send a self-addressed stamped envelope to: Eggs, PO Box 5847,
Novato, CA 94948.) 

<P> There are other important foods and nutrients affecting
undesirable cholesterol levels.  Lots of fiber in your diet can have the effect of
reducing dietary cholesterol absorption, so a simple bowl of oatmeal 
<P ALIGN="center">

<BR>
THE FORM OF AN OIL

HUMAN METABOLISM.
</P>
        for breakfast or brown rice for lunch can be heartprotective.  Garlic (either
fresh or in capsules), gamma oryzanol (from rice bran oil, available in capsule
form), and the essential fatty acids from fish oil (also sold in capsules), have
been shown to reduce unwanted cholesterol, reduce mortality, or both.  How much of
each of these should you take?  Follow manufacturer's instructions - preparations
and sources vary.  Please note that these are just the tip of the iceberg.  The
list of nutrients and foods reducing unhealthy cholesterol is a very long one! <P>
Good nutrition and supplements can activate natural control and healing processes,
rather than intervene using an artificial mechanism like cholesterol-lowering
drugs.  Such drugs block absorption of other nutrients and impair liver function. 
They also reduce alertness and are the cause of increased accidents.  Isn't it
surprising that patients take these drugs even after physicians warn about the need
for routine check-ups because of potential danger?  Most people don't realize that
testing devices can't perceive liver damage until far too many cells have been
destroyed. 
<P> Sidney M. Wolfe, MD, advises that drugs should not be the first
choice for lowering cholesterol unless other circumstances exist.  "A change from
animal to vegetable proteins often corrects high cholesterol," says Dr. Wolfe.'
"Supplementation [of fiber]," he continues, "can significantly lower total
cholesterol and LDL cholesterol by absorbing water and softening the stools in your
intestine." [A high-quality fiber/antioxidant/ plant-enzyme combination kit, Rx for
Life, is available at special discount: Retails at $79.95, slashed to $34.95 plus
$4.00 S/H for Digest readers.  Lambert Co., 1265 Oakmond Pkway, Sunnyvale, CA
94086. 1-800-350-8350.1 Why, in light of all this, has dietary cholesterol - and
the extreme measures associated with lowering it - acquired the reputation as the
single most significant factor in heart disease?  This view persists even though a
very significant proportion of coronary heart disease cases also occurs in people
with normal or low cholesterol. 
<P> In 1982, a ten-year study costing $115 million
and involving over 12,000 subjects concluded that diet was important and that
changed eating habits could save lives.' Any nutrition-oriented practitioner could
have spared the researchers all that time and expense, saving many lives in the
interim. 
<P> It has become increasingly more difficult to separate nutrition
knowledge from advertising copy.  Let us remind physicians that by the first decade
of this century, consumption of animal fat and cholesterol in the United States had
already come close to the levels of mid-century. Yet the epidemic
<P ALIGN="center">
THINK ABOUT THESE FACTS
<BR>
THE NEXT TIME YOU HEAR OR SEE AN
<BR>
AD FOR A CHOLESTEROL-FREE FOOD OR
<BR>
A CHOLESTEROL-LOWERING DRUG.
</P>
        spread of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease did not appear for
generations.  And after coronary heart disease peaked in the 1950s, there followed
a slow but gradual decline between 1960 and 1980, while cholesterol in our diets
continued to climb slightly.  Think about these facts the next time you hear or see
an ad for a cholesterol-free food or a cholesterol-lowering drug.
 <P> And what
about population groups like Eskimos and other non-industrialized societies who
consume huge amounts of dietary cholesterol and have high blood cholesterol, yet
very low mortality due to coronary heart disease? Or the group of Indians who cat
small amounts of fat but suffer seven times more acute heart attacks? Why do
Northern Asiatic Indians eat a very high percentage of their calories as fat,
mostly from butter, yet have exceptionally-low cardiovascular disease?' The same is
true for a group of American Indians, the Mvskoke. 

<P> Clearly there are gaping
holes in the logic of cause-and-effect as far as cholesterol in your diet and
coronary heart disease are concerned.  We cannot discuss diet without noting the
important differences between good food and bad food. Within each nutrient
category (fats, proteins, etc.), food can be healthful or deadly, full of nurturing
stuff or toxins, and yet major research efforts make no distinctions. 

<P> In the
interest of your own health, give some thought to the following: Does the
unsaturated oil you consume come from rancid cooking oil used for deep frying - or
from fresh oil-bearing seeds and nuts?  Are your carbohydrates from sugar-sweetened
junk foods - or from fruits and vegetables?  Were your eggs scrambled (a method
promoting free radicals) - or poached (the better way to prepare an egg; try to
keep that yolk runny)?  Your grilled meat ground to bits (inducing trans-fatty
acids), laden with harmful chemicals to make them tasty and with nitrates to make
them pretty - or organically-derived? Has the saturated fat been on a hot, slatted
grill where the fat dripped into the coals and the fire threw it back up to the
food (creating trans-fatty acids) - or grilled on a pan to prevent this from
happening?  Has the unsaturated fat been hydrogenated into artificial shortening?

<P ALIGN="center">
WERE YOUR EGGS SCRAMBLED
<BR>
OR POACHED?
</P>
Major food suppliers aren't likely to touch a research Project if results would
point to their standard practices as a major cause of widespread death and disease.
(Congress is finally investigating the tobacco industry for withholding research. 
Do you think there's a chance that the food industry will be next?) 

<P> To reverse
its findings now, the medical establishment would result in a serious loss of
credibility Of course, saving face is probably a minor concern compared to money,
even in the world of medical research.  While it's not our intent to malign the
medical research community, it should be understood that money from drug companies
and the food industry is distributed throughout the research institutes of the
world. 

<P> Remember when Eisenhower cautioned us to beware of the
military/industrial/ complex taking over?  The medical/drug/food/complex is just as
dangerous, causing even more misery and death than Hitler! 

<P> What this means for
you and me is that we have to take a very long, hard and critical look at any
proposed treatment that involves a patented drug.  A dietary recommendation,
however simple, that threatens the food industry has a tough time in our supposedly
free market of information.  You can't patent garlic, rice, fish, or exercise, and
no food conglomerate will make money if you, the consumer packaged oils and fats
cooked at high temperature.  Meanwhile, as stated in a June 1994 issue of Lancet,
"understanding heart disease, our most serious health disorder, is now confused,
its management at stalemate."
