FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE: CURRENT ISSUES AND OPTIONS FOR REFORM

By Ralph M. Chite, Environment and Natural Resources Policy Division.
18 pages.  Farmer participation in the federally subsidized crop
insurance program has fallen short of goals anticipated in 1980 when
the program was greatly expanded.  Low participation rates have
contributed to the enactment of ad hoc disaster assistance bills,
which have authorized more than $6 billion in additional direct
payments since 1988. Many policymakers are concerned that the federal
budget cannot continue to support both crop insurance and disaster
payments, and that Congress might be required to reconsider the
proper role of the government in farm risk management.  This paper
pro-vides background on the mechanics of the crop insurance program
and explores policy options and dilemmas in reforming the program.
Order No. 92-318 ENR.

THE FEDERAL DEBT:  WHO BEARS ITS BURDEN?  ISSUE BRIEF

By William A. Cox, Office of Senior Specialists.  As the federal
government's debt has mushroomed since 1992 at a rate unparalleled in
peacetime, questions about its effects have taken on greater
importance.  Despite steps to reduce the deficit, public debt will
continue to rise rapidly in the next several years.  Who is being
hurt by this development, and who, if anyone, benefits?  Should we be
concerned about heavy reliance on foreign capital?  What are the
implications of rising federal interest payments?  Are we "mortgaging
the nation's future," imposing a swelling burden on posterity?  These
questions are the subject of this brief.  Order No. IB92049.

SHAREHOLDER VOTING CONCERNING EXECUTIVE PAY

By Michael V. Seitzinger, American Law Division.  4 pages.  The issue
of how much executives of a corporation should be paid is especially
controversial at this time.  A recent change by the Securities and
Exchange Commission in an interpretation of the proxy regulations
will require certain shareholder proposals concerning executive
compensation to be included in proxy materials.  Nevertheless, there
is still congressional interest in enacting legislation more
stringent than this interpretation.  Order No. 92-254 A.

CONSTITUTIONALITY OF COMPELLING DISCLOSURES CONCERNING MOTION PICTURE

By Henry Cohen, American Law Division.  5 pages.  Although movie

that a film itself disclose information, a better case could be made
that the bill regulated noncommercial speech.  As it is, however, it
appears more likely that the bill would be viewed as regulating
solely commercial speech.  Order No. 92-256 A.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FUNDING ISSUES:  FY 1993; ISSUE BRIEF

By Angela Evans, Education and Public Welfare Division.  Each year
Congress decides funding levels for all programs within the
Department of Education (ED).  Most ED programs are discretionary.
This means that the annual appropriation determines the amount of
funding that will be available to support program activities for a
given fiscal year.  During the process Congress deliberates what
might be appropriate levels of funding for ED programs, how these
levels differ from previous year funding levels, how programs might
be changed to effect savings, and how funding for ED programs
complies with the budget enforcement provisions to restrain spending
on domestic discretionary programs.  Order No. IB92048.

GIANT OIL FIELDS AND DOMESTIC OIL PRODUCTION

By Joseph P. Riva, Jr., Science Policy Research Division.  7 pages.
Giant oil fields are among the most valuable concentrations of
natural wealth on earth.  When developed anywhere, they contribute
significantly to economic and individual well-being.  With its high
standard of living based on high per capita energy consumption, this
has been particularly true for the United States.  New giant fields
are needed to shore up declining domestic oil production, thus
helping to keep energy affordable.  However, almost all undiscovered
domestic giant fields are likely to be site-specific to a relatively
few areas in Alaska and on the outer continental shelves.  Great
controversy reflecting differing societal values surrounds the
development of oil in these areas, but there is a price for not
exploring.  it could be very high.  Order No. 92-265 SPR.

OIL RECYCLING BILLS:  A COMPARISON OF H.R. 872, H.R. 1411, H.R. 3956,
AND INDUSTRY'S PROPOSAL

By Mark Reisch, Environment and Natural Resources Policy Division.
22 pages.  Used oil is a valuable resource that can be re-refined
back into lubricating oil, or used as a fuel.  But when disposed
improperly, it presents a threat to the environment and public
health.  How to properly regulate used oil to protect the
environment, while at the same time encouraging recycling and not
discouraging collection, has been a difficult problem for the
Environmental Protection Agency.  This report compares, section by
section, three bills of the 102nd Congress and a proposal of the
American Petroleum Institute that attempt to encourage recycling of
used oil.  Order No. 92-247 ENR.

BANK MERGERS AND INTERSTATE BANKING:  POLICY ISSUES

By William Jackson, Economics Division.  25 pages.  To some
observers, the very survival of the banking industry as we know it
appears threatened.  Its falling market shares and profitability may
suggest that industry consolidation is necessary to eliminate excess
capacity; some believe through nationwide banking involving
acquisitions across state lines.  But would the result be consistent
with financial competition?  This report analyzes the economic
relationships involved, and presents policy options for Congress to
deal with them.  Order No. 92-305 E.

CONGRESS AND THE CRISIS IN U.S.-CHINA POLICY, 1991

By Robert G. Sutter, Office of Senior Specialists.  24 pages.  The
debate between the Bush Administration and its congressional backers,
and a large bipartisan group of critics in Congress over U.S. policy
toward China went through three general states in 1991.  The first
stage saw congressional criticism of China, and Bush Administration
policy toward China, moderate in late 1990 and early 1991.  There was
an outpouring of congressional criticism of China on human rights,
trade, and arms proliferation issues, and criticism of the Bush
Administration's "failed" China policy.  The third state came after
critical votes on conditional most favored nation legislation in
July.  At year's end, all sides in the debate anticipated continued
strong congressional criticism of Chinese practices and Bush
Administration policy.  Order No. 92-324 S.

THE ISRAELI ECONOMY AND ITS EXTERNAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS:  AN OVERVIEW

By Patricia Wertman, Economics Division.  34 pages.  This report
examines the performance of the Israeli economy between 1985 and
1990.  The results of Israel's 1985 stabilization program are
discussed.  Particular emphasis is placed upon Israel's external
sector, that is, its export performance and its level of external
indebtedness.  The report concludes that Israel's stabilization
policy has been largely successful, but that the economy requires
significant resource transfers from abroad.  The recent surge of
immigration into Israel is likely to place fundamental economic
patterns under stress, particularly the near-monopoly structure of
Israel's labor market.  The future outlook of the Israeli economy
and, particularly, its future debt-servicing capacity are tied to
these issues.  Order No. 92-276 E.

YUGOSLAVIA:  NATIONALISM AND ETHNIC RELATIONS:  SELECTED REFERENCES,
1989-1992

By Valentin Leskovsek, Library Services Division.  22 pages.  Events
in Yugoslavia in the last few years have exposed the fragile unity of
a loosely knit, multinational federation.  After the Second World
War, Tito's communism kept an iron hand on the ethnic tensions.  With
his death, the political polarization along ethnic, religious, and
economic lines resurfaced, and national antagonisms rendered a
peaceful solution impossible.  Seeing no way out of a constitutional
stalemate, Slovenia and Croatia each voted for a peaceful separation
and independence.  This brought the armed intervention of the
Yugoslav army wishing to prevent federal disintegration, a step that
pushed the country into a civil war.  This short bibliography of
selected books and articles deals with the present Yugoslav crisis.

ANTITRUST LAW AND JOINT ACTIVITY BY HOSPITALS

By Janice E. Rubin, American Law Division.  9 pages.  Some concern
has been expressed that the federal antitrust laws may be unduly
hindering some hospitals from undertaking joint activities--including
the sharing of technology or expensive medical equipment--which they
believe are necessary in order to maximize the efficiency of their
operations.  Indeed, many hospital administrators are afraid that if
they even talk to each other, much less undertake joint programs,
they will automatically violate the antitrust laws, which prohibit
the anticompetitive consequences of certain actions.  This report,
therefore, will first get out some of the more important concepts in
antitrust law which are pertinent to the issue of joint activity by
hospitals.  It will conclude, after establishing a context, with some
possible congressional or hospital actions to reduce the likelihood
of antitrust challenges.  Order No. 92-269 A.

For women, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer.  The
National Cancer Institute (NCI) estimates that in 1992 46,000 women
will die of breast cancer and 180,000 new cases will be diagnosed.
Controversy continues over the use of mammography in screening
asymptomatic women for the early detection of breast cancer.  A 1990
National Institutes of Health consensus development conference
concluded that lumpectomy is as effective as mastectomy in treating
early breast cancer.  Despite this, only 20 percent of women eligible
for lumpectomy have this new procedure.  Debate persists over whether
breast cancer patients with negative lymph nodes should receive
adjuvant therapy with its attendant risks when only a small
percentage of those treated will actually benefit.  Order No. 92-279

(NCI) estimates that in 1992 13,000 women will die of ovarian cancer
and 21,000 new cases will be diagnosed.  Ovarian cancer is difficult
to diagnose because it often imitates other diseases.  Recent

Although, at present, women account for only 10 percent of AIDS cases
reported to CDC, women are the fastest growing group in the HIV
epidemic.  The route of HIV exposure in women is shifting from IV
drug use to heterosexual contact.  Because the medical conditions
experienced by many HIV-infected women are not included in the CDC
AIDS definition, women often are diagnosed and treated later than
men.  Also, women may not qualify for benefit payments because their

ATTORNEY'S FEES:  THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL TO ADOPT THE
ENGLISH RULE

By Harry Cohen, American Law Division.  In the United States, each
party to a lawsuit ordinarily must pay its own attorneys' fees.
Courts generally may order the losing party to pay the winning
party's fees only when authorized by statute.  This is known as the
"American rule," in contrast with the English rule, under which the
losing party routinely pays the attorneys' fees of the prevailing
party.  The President's Council on Competitiveness has proposed that
Congress adopted the English rule in cases brought in federal court
on the basis of diversity jurisdiction.  The proposal has been

PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW ABROGATING RESTRICTIONS ON POSSESSION OF
FIREARMS BY CONVICTED FELONS

By P.L. Morgan, American Law Division.  Federal law prohibits a
felon, convicted by state or federal authorities, from possessing
firearms.  Most states have similar laws.  Relief from this
disability arising from a federal conviction for crimes against the
United States can come from a Presidential pardon.  The diverse
states have several methods of authorizing felons to possess
firearms, though not all do.  Eliminating the state prohibition also
has the effect of authorizing the felon to legally possess firearms
under federal law.  This report briefly describes the state laws
prohibiting possession of firearms by felons and the provisions, if
any, for voiding those restrictions.  Order No. 92-262 A.

INTELLIGENCE REORGANIZATION PROPOSALS:  ISSUE BRIEF

By Richard A. Best, Foreign Affairs and National Defense Division.
With the end of the Cold War, many observers are urging that the U.S.
intelligence community be reshaped to serve altered national security
policies and to accommodate likely budgetary reductions.  Some

community should be accomplished, at lease in part, by legislation.
Bills have been introduced and it is likely that there will be
considerable discussion of intelligence reorganization throughout the
remainder of the 102nd Congress.  Order No. IB92053.

THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX FOR INDIVIDUALS

By Gregg A. Esenwein, Economics Division.  5 pages.  Many individuals
are able to take advantage of the preferences and incentives in the
individual tax code to reduce their income taxes and avoid paying
their share of the tax burden.  To address this problem of fairness
while still preserving the social and economic incentives in the tax
code, Congress enacted the individual minimum tax.  Since its
inception, the value and effectiveness of the minimum tax has
routinely been the focus of congressional debate.  Order No. 92-304

INCOME TAX PAYMENTS BY FOREIGN-CONTROLLED CORPORATIONS

By Harry G. Gourevitch, Office of Senior Specialists.  9 pages.  In
recent years allegations have been made that domestic corporations
controlled by foreign investors are less profitable and pay less
income tax than domestic corporations controlled by U.S. investors,

TAX PROPOSALS: A BRIEF COMPARISON OF THE HOUSE, SENATE, AND
ADMINISTRATION ALTERNATIVES

By Jack Taylor and David L. Brumbaugh, Economics Division.  9 pages.
As March 1991, enters its closing weeks, Congress is moving toward
final consideration of three alternative tax plans:  one sponsored by
the President; one passed by the House; and one approved by the
Senate.  The plans are similar in certain broad respects; all contain
saving and investment incentives designed to improve economic
performance, and all contain a number of provisions whose stated goal
in to assist families or to promote health, education, and home
ownership.  The details of the plans, however, differed widely.

TAX PROVISIONS EXPIRING IN 1992

By David L. Brumbauch, Economics division.  6 pages.  As Congress
debates alternative tax plans in 1992, one question it is considering
is the fate of 12 temporary tax provisions that are scheduled to
expire at the end of June 1992.  In each case, the immediate issue is
whether to let the particular provision expire, or to extend it or
make it permanent.  And while each of the so-called "extenders" is
unique, at a very general level they all pose a similar questions:
each extender is a tax benefit for a particular activity, and each
results in a loss of tax revenue.  In each case, is the activity the
provision promotes beneficial enough to warrant government support
and the resulting revenue loss and diversion of resources from other
uses?  Order No. 92-273 E.

asked question concerning the rate schedules is why taxable income
reported by an unmarried individual is taxed at a higher rate than a
like amount of taxable income reported by a married couple filing
jointly.  This is an anomaly of having graduated rates applicable to
different types of taxpayers.  Order No. 92-319 A.
