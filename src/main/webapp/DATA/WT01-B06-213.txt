	Nike has invaded the NFL with Alien Gear</B>
      </H1>
      <P>
      <P>
      <B>Welcome to the National Football League, the pride of Taiwan, Bangladesh
      and China. You thought football was American? Although the official NFL football
      is made by Wilson in the US of A, the league has authorized Nike, Reebok
      and others to produce official NFL gear in Third World countries which allow
      child labor, slave labor and sweatshop conditions.</B>
      <P>
      <B>There's nothing better than cool autumn Sundays spent watching professional
      football at the stadium or in the comfort of your own living room. Everyone
      has their favorite team. Maybe you grew up outside of Philadelphia and are
      a diehard Eagles fan. Or maybe you had a favorite player like Unitas, or
      Starr, or Bradshaw who seemed to carry their entire team on their back, and
      so their team became your team. And maybe you have that old jersey your father
      gave you, the jersey that made you proud to be associated with that player
      or team, and with football in general. But things have changed.</B>
      <P>
      <B>Now when you go to give your son or daughter a T-shirt or hat bearing
      their favorite team's logo--look at the label. Where you might expect to
      find the words "Made in the USA," you now see "Made in China" or "Made in
      Bangladesh." Professional football has become this country's most popular
      sport, and many athletes make more money in a season than most Americans
      could hope to spend in a lifetime. Players and owners like Deion Sanders
      and Art Modell tell us that football has become a business, and what matters
      is the bottom line. Not all owners and players agree. Frank Gifford, former
      Giants star and husband of Kathy Lee, agrees that NFL teams should require
      that products licensed to use NFL logos be made in the USA. </B>
      <P>
      <B>We at the Made in the USA Foundation believe in a different conception
      of football. We see football as America's sport which brings families and
      friends together, encouraging friendly rivalries and spirited good times.
      Many of football's most loyal fans are hard-working individuals our country's
      manufacturing sector. Yet as more and more manufacturing is shipped overseas,
      these men and women rightfully fear losing their jobs. We call on the NFL's
      owners to re-evaluate their priorities, and bring the production of their
      "official" products back to the United States.</B>
      <P>
      <B>A large majority of NFL fans want to buy U.S.-made products. But by importing
      NFL-logo products, the National Football League and its teams are turning
      off the fans, the lifeblood of the sport. These fans now are refusing to
      buy imported souvenirs and have become irritated by the lack of choice. I
      believe that it is in the owners' long-term interests to keep fans supportive
      and enthusiastic.</B>
      <P>
      <B>For every player who makes it to the NFL there are literally thousands
      who don't make the grade. Unfortunately, many of these athletes are unemployed
      or are employed in low-wage jobs. In this tough job market we need to keep
      Americans working at productive jobs. The backbone of our economy has always
      been manufacturing. Making NFL-logo products in the USA will not by itself
      turn the economy around, but it is an important symbolic step to creating
      jobs in the United States.</B>
      <P>
      <B>Did you know that NFL coaches and players can be fined for wearing American
      hats on the sidelines? The football league strongly enforces its game day
      rules for authorized clothing. While the league's henchman are tough on rule
      violators, incredibly its rules favor importers of souvenir hats and
      jerseys.</B>
      <P>
      <B>The National Football League, as well as many collegiate teams, sell their
      souls to the highest bidders. Nike, Starter and Reebok, all three hollow
      companies, pay millions of dollars for the rights to use the logos of the
      Dallas Cowboys and many other NFL franchises. By hollow companies I mean
      companies that don't own a single factory. They are not manufacturers at
      all, they are marketing companies.</B>
      <P>
      <B>College souvenirs are also being made in sweatshops overseas. I saw a
      University of Maryland jersey at J.C. Penney's selling for over $60.00 that
      was made in Bangladesh. Irate, I called University officials who placed the
      blame on the Collegiate Licensing Company.</B>
      <P>
      <B>The Collegiate Licensing Company represents 145 major universities in
      the United States, from Yale and Georgetown to Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,
      University of North Carolina and the Air Force Academy. For from $50 to $1,000
      anyone can be authorized to make T-shirts, sweatshirts, hats or jerseys with
      the logos of these well-known universities. Collegiate Licensing, and the
      colleges themselves, could require that team logo products be made in the
      USA.</B>
      <P>
      <B>Next time you see your favorite sports team's name on a T-shirt or hat,
      look at the label. If it is not made in the USA--don't buy it. Send the NFL
      and your favorite team a message: you will support it when it supports creating
      jobs in the USA.</B>
