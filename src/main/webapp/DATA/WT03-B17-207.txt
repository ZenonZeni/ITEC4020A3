Dear Andy:
This is my first look at your site and it's terrific! We are just
getting into the agricultural business with a special growing
soil found in China. Our new agri friends say that the biggest
problem here in California is the white fly. I am sure you are very familiar with this
dangerous insect which distroys crops en masse. Do you have any methods
to curtail or eliminate this pesky fly. Appreciate your answer to this,
or any referral to other sources. Regards.

Dear John,
What is that special soil your talking about? I would be interested in
testing it for you and seeing for myself....
concerning the whitefly problem.
There are many organic soultions to this problem..
my feelings is to deal with the cause and that the whitefly is only the
effects.
Some of the causes is
1..over use of chemicals both fertilizers and pesticides..
causes inbalance in nature....
2...over use of high nitrogen fertilizers..high nitrogen causes stress
and rapid tender growth..
3...city water kills bacteria in soil...dead soil causes imbalance
amongst bacteria found in soil.

what is the answer?
1...go organic!
bring the soil back to life and nature will be able to control it
herself..
but that takes time which most people don't have...
2...introduct natural whitefly predators such as Encarsia formosa(I
know its for green houses but it does work outside too), a stronger
predator is Eretmocerus nr. californicus a parasitic wasp..very
effective! There are more see my web site under Beneficials I have
known.
3...here are some organic tools you can use to kill them off with...
    a....Dr bronners peppermint soap will kill them dead! Experiment
with the strength but 10 tablespoons per gallon should do it.. to this
I would add a liquid pyrethrin/rotenone at 2 oz per gallon(avoid if
chemically sensitive since its is strong) and finally I would add a
dash of Ultra Fine Oil( say 2 oz per gallon). Avoid use during heat of
day, best at night.
    b...you must control the ants since they herd aphids which produce
nectar which the whiteflys love! see my web site entitled Dances with
Ants.
    c... there are many other things you can do , (see web site ), hope
this helps.
Yours
