<h1>Richardson-Taylor<br>
Reunion News </h1>

<hr>

<p>December 3, 1994 </p>

<p>Yes, just when you thought you would never hear from any of us
again, it is time to start planning for the next major debacle,
the family reunion of 1995. I did not attend the last reunion in
Washington myself and I understand that the turnout was lower
than any time in recent memory, primarily because of a persistent
rumor that Bill Henry would show up. He did not show up, to the
great relief of everyone in the family and Washington's farm
animals, too. Laurence is the organizer of the 1995 reunion and
says that he has taken steps to have guards posted to prevent
Bill Henry from showing up. Therefore, he says, we will not have
to worry about Bill Henry's ugly mug spoiling any of the group
pictures. He probably would have spent most of his time doing the
Morris Moon anyway. </p>

<p>Laurence, as you all know, is now a married man which just
goes to prove that the laws against such things are not
tremendously effective. He wrote me to tell me that he had been
laid up recently due to a heart bypass operation (apparently the
doctors found that his heart served no useful purpose) and an
operation for a blood clot in his leg. Both of these problems, he
said, were the result of what could be politely described as an
overly strenuous honeymoon, which he related at great length, and
was obviously confused with some things which actually happened
in high school. Men really don't need drugs because they have
women. Barbara, his bride tells a somewhat different story, with
considerably fewer disgusting details. In any event, he says that
he is recovering nicely now and will be just as gross and
disgusting as we all have gotten used to, and even come to
cherish. Like Don Morris, he is something of a gem in his own
right. </p>

<p>I have not been in touch with many of you so I cannot relate a
lot of news about other people. I can assure you it is a great
relief. However, on my own front, some significant things have
happened. As far as my campaign to get our drug laws changed,
there has been more success than we had dared hope. Far too much
has happened, even in the last six months, for me to relate it
all so I will stick to some of the highlights. </p>

<ul>
    <li>Both the California Medical Association and the
        Department of Health and Human Services have issued major
        reports stating that the undertreatment of pain in the
        United States is a major national tragedy. They said that
        narcotics such as morphine are the cheapest, safest, and
        most effective treatments for pain and the reason doctors
        do not prescribe them is because they are afraid of
        prosecution if they do. Both organizations recommended
        that narcotics be used as soon as the patients request
        them and that patients be allowed to control their own
        dose. They both said that the risk of addiction is so
        small that it is of no practical concern. As the
        Department of Health and Human Services said,
        &quot;Addiction (as the result of medical use of
        narcotics) almost never happens.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The head of Interpol, the British Association of Chiefs
        of Police, the Attorney-General of Colombia, and many
        other major law enforcement officials have called for
        either decriminalization or legalization of drugs and it
        is apparent that several law enforcement officials and
        organizations are now mounting a major push to get drugs
        decriminalized in all of Europe. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There have been two TV specials and several radio shows
        in the last six months which were based at least in part
        on the things I have written, one by MTV which aired in
        September, and another by the BBC titled &quot;The Drug
        War, R.I.P.&quot;, which aired on the Arts and
        Entertainment Channel in September. There will also be a
        one-hour television special coming up on ABC which, I
        understand, will be based largely on the points I have
        made and taught others to make. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Our campaign for a Federal commission to review drug
        policy has been successful. Language establishing such a
        commission was included in the recent Crime Bill, which
        everyone made such a fuss about. In all the hullabaloo
        about banning guns, Representative Don Edwards of San
        Jose was able to slip the language in during the
        Conference Committee and it went unnoticed in the final
        vote, even though a number of members of Congress had
        said they were deadset against it. The commission is due
        to start its work in 1996 and is supposed to issue its
        report by 1998. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>A couple of years ago I published a pamphlet I called
        Persuasive Strategies. The purpose of it was to teach
        anyone how to beat the snot out of drug warriors in a
        debate and do it so completely that there would be no
        question in anyone's mind who won the debate. These
        strategies were probably the primary reason for the
        success of all the things we have done. A lot of other
        people saw them, liked them, and started using them,
        including a lot of fairly famous people. As a result, The
        Drug Enforcement Administration and their allies have
        found that they have been getting their butts kicked
        every time they showed up to discuss the subject in
        public -- all across the nation. They called an emergency
        meeting in August, calling in drug warriors from all
        across the country to discuss what to do about it. <br>
        It must have been an interesting meeting. I can just
        imagine the conversation, &quot;I got my butt kicked in
        LA.&quot; &quot;I got my butt kicked in Buffalo&quot;,
        &quot;I got my ass kicked in Albuquerque&quot; and so
        forth. Unfortunately, they did not invite me or I could
        have given them a few tips myself.<br>
        In order to try to combat what I have been doing they
        have issued a 40 page booklet called &quot;How to Hold
        Your Own in a Drug Legalization Debate&quot; which
        attempts to train their people how to debate people who
        are using my tactics. They even lifted paragraphs from my
        pamphlet and slightly altered the wording. Imitation is
        the sincerest form of flattery. I thought one paragraph
        from their booklet was particularly flattering:<br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Legalization proponents are formidable opponents. The group
acknowledged that proponents of legalization are generally
well-prepared and credible people whose arguments, though
compelling, are faulty. Proponents effectively use lawyers and
public relations firms to espouse liberalization of drug
policies.<br>
</p>

<p>Shortly after their booklet was published I got a call from a
publisher asking me to do a book in reply to theirs, which you
should see in the bookstores next year. </p>

<p>But enough about politics. Now we will go on to the sordid
details of the next reunion. </p>

<font size="2"><b>When</b>           <b>July 8 and 9, 1995</b>                                          
<b>Saturday and Sunday</b>                                         
                                                            

<b>Where</b>          Picnic Area C                                               
               Finley Park, at the corner of Stony Point Road and College  
               Avenue                                                      
               Santa Rosa, California                                      

<b>Directions:</b>    From Highway 101, take Highway 12 west one mile and turn    
               north on Stony Point Road.  The park is at the fourth stop  
               light.                                                      
               There is a map attached to this newsletter, but it was      
               based on something drawn by Laurence so I cannot verify     
               its accuracy.                                               

 
               Any child who is not living within thirty feet of you is    
               considered a separate household.  That's you, Alyssa.       

<b>Bring</b>          Locals should bring one main dish such as beans, salad,     
               etc.  Laurence always recommends that somebody bring beans  
               and says that, despite his recent medical problems he will  
               be &quot;in tune&quot;.                                               
               Out-of-towners should bring appetizers and desserts.        

<b>Where to</b>       Sandman Motel -- (707) 544 8570                             
<b>Stay:</b>          Super 8 -- (800) 800-8000                                   
               Days Inn -- (800) 325-2525                                  
               Los Robles -- (707) 545-6330                                
               Laurence says they are all close and have restaurants       
               nearby.                                                     

<b>Supplies:</b>      Safeway, Albertson's, and Longs Drugs are a half milefrom   
               the park.  Safeway has an excellent deli.                   

<b>Other:</b>         The park has swimming pools, which Laurence says cost a     
               bundle.  It also has volley ball, horse shoes (for those    
               of you who don't have your own shoes), tennis, covered      
               pavilions with barbecues, handicapped access and restrooms  
               (I'll bet you are all glad of that!)  It also has a very    
               nice playground.
