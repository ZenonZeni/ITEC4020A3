THE SCIENCE OF ALLIANCE

Nowhere are partnerships more important in the broadcasting industry
than in Asia. And within Asia no market is considered to be hotter
property for cable and satellite right now than India and the
Subcontinent.

A population of 900 million that supports a middle class of 250
million, coupled with 14,000 cabled homes and rising, are figures not
to be sniffed at by western broadcasters looking to extend their brands
into the Far East.

But in a pioneer market, no amount of high production values or honed
channel images and marketing campaigns will ensure that signals reach
cable operators, that cable operators relay them to households and
that, in the case of the pay-TV channels at least, subscription
revenues find their way back into the right pockets. India is no
exception.

Although of all the channels targeting that region, ESPN and Disney
have arguably the sort of programming that will pretty much translate
anywhere, their respective alliances with the Modi Group is a smart
one. A diversified conglomerate, Modi's foray into entertainment -
although still fledgling - is comprehensive. Offering its partners
everything from production possibilities, distribution networks,
subscriber management and revenue collection, Modi is a one-stop shop
and a grass-roots partnership. In return, the Indian company can expect
to receive the Western broadcasting know-how it presently lacks. But
with a collective turnover of $2 billion plus a year, knowledge is all
the Modis are likely to require and that may only be in the short term.
Its high-profile alliance with Disney may also put it out of reach of
others: zealously protective of its brand, Disney is likely to be
precious as to who else it allows to join its Indian stable.

The Modi-Disney-ESPN hook up is only one of several big Asian deals
that have been cemented over recent months. Partnerships and global
alliances are increasingly become the way forward in Asia. But
remaining available opportunities will, and are narrowing.

SIX MONTH INVESTIGATION INTO FAILURE OF APSTAR 2

China Great Wall Industry Corp. and Hughes Space and Communications
have concluded their six month investigation into the failure of Apstar
2, which exploded in January,  seconds after take off via a Long March
rocket. The failure has been put down to wind shear which damaged
either the satellite or the rocket. As yet there is no set date for the
launch of Asiasat 2, which is also set to go up via a Long March rocket
before the end of the year.

NBC ASIA AND NBC SUPER CHANNEL ASIA DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT

Both NBC Asia and NBC Super Channel Asia are to be distributed in
Indonesia as part of Star TV's multi channel pay-TV package designed
specifically for the Indonesian market. Broadcasting off Asiasat 2, the
service will be available in early 1996 and will be distributed by the

in the archipelago. The U.S. network has also announced distribution in
two other countries. Following an agreement signed with distributor
Cable Boss, NBC Asia will be available to cable TV subscribers in the
Philippines. While in Taiwan, the news and current affairs channel will
work together with Liann Yee Production Co who will not only handle the
distribution for NBC Asia but will also work to adapt some of its
programming specifically for the Taiwan market. The agreement in Taiwan
also applies to NBC Super Channel Asia when it launches, probably in
early 1996.

KOREASAT 1 LAUNCHED

South Korea's first domestic satellite, Koreasat 1, launched in August
from the Kennedy Space Centre in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on board a
McDonnell Douglas Delta 2 rocket. However, a low performance by the
rocket in its first stage left the satellite in a lower than desired
orbit. Koreasat 1 which was supposed to have been placed into an oval
orbit with a high point 22,200 miles above the earth, missed its mark
by about 3,800 miles. According to McDonnell Douglas, the satellite
will be able to use its onboard thrusters to correct the altitude
deficit, but will have to sacrifice some of its expected 10 year life.
The satellite's 12 KU-band transponders had been earmarked for the
delivery of direct broadcasting, fixed telecommunications and
electronic data throughout the Korean Peninsula.

PAY-TV LICENSING CHANGES

Thai broadcasting authority the Public Relations Department (PRD) is
expected to make changes to its system for pay-TV licensing. Currently
the PRD simply charges Baht 25,000 ($1,000) for a licence, however
director general Arun Ngamdee admitted the rules need to be adjusted.
It is possible they will be changed to mirror the Mass Communication
Organisation of Thailand (MCOT)'s licensing policy. MCOT, the only
other Thai body authorised to give out pay-TV licences, takes an equity
stake in each incumbent.

intend to launch their own pay networks but say IBC will take
precedence, at least initially.

Sony Pictures Entertainment, in conjunction with Singapore-based
production company Argos Communications Enterprises (ACE), is to launch

PASSAGE TO INDIA

The Modi Group dominates India's broadcasting industry. Anil Wanvari
profiles the diversified company, which, through a combination of
market-savvy and strategic alliances, has left its competitors standing

It all started as a twinkle in a little boy's eye. Lalit Modi, a scion
of the multi-billion dollar Indian Modi group, was bowled over by the
delights of Disney comics and movies. As he grew into college and went
to the U.S. to study management, the twinkle turned into admiration for
the company responsible for pioneering the animated feature film. Then
admiration turned to ambition, he too would set up an entertainment
empire... in India.

Today Lalit Modi, 32, is well on the way to achieving that ambition. As
president and managing director of the Modi Entertainment Group (MEG),
he is piecing together an outfit that may well become the most
integrated entertainment business in India and has made several matches
with global entertainment leaders, including Disney, ESPN, U.S producer-
distributors New World Entertainment and Multimedia Entertainment, and
theatrical conglomerate United Artists, to distribute and market their
product in Asia's most dynamic broadcasting market. Other high-calibre
deals incorporating programme production, channel distribution and even
publishing are sitting on the table.

Being part of a large Marwari - a community known for its financial
acumen and entrepreneuralism - probably made things easier for Modi as
he didn't have to scout around for start-up capital.

Started by his grandfather, Gujar Mal Modi in 1933, the Modi group is
today involved in a whole series of activities from manufacturing
through service industries like telecommunications and oil and gas
exploration. It boasts a collective turnover of $2 billion-plus. In
fact, the Modis even have a township named after them - Modinagar.

However, the group is not exactly a cohesive whole as it has split into
factions, each represented by one of Gujar Mal Modi's sons. The
splinter that has spawned the entertainment arm is the $300 million
diversified Krishan Kumar Modi company, run by Lalit's father, KK Modi.
With fingers in numerous pies from the manufacturing of cosmetics for
Estee Lauder and cigarettes in partnership with Philip Morris, to tea
retailing via the

Tea City outlet, KK Modi's flagship companies include Godfrey Philips
(cigarettes and the tea), Indofil Chemicals, (fertilisers to
polyester), Modern Home Care (household products) and, of course, the
entertainment concerns, which are just taking shape.

"The reasons for getting into entertainment were clear," says Lalit
Modi. "No large company has looked at it as a serious business [in
India] and hence there was an opportunity to corporatise it. It [the
market] consisted of mom and pop-type operators with thousands of
players, all of them small. The reasons for our entering TV were that a
boom was inevitable. There was just a single channel but restrictions
were being lifted which would change this. Entertainment is the
backbone of Indians. We had the infrastructure, marketing and brand-
building savvy and were ideally positioned to make a go of it."

What makes the Modis different from other Indian groups looking at
entering the entertainment industry is the group's broad perspective
and ambition. Lalit Modi believes in using a network of companies to
straddle every segment of the entertainment business.

"I want the Modi Entertainment Group to be in every aspect of
entertainment. I want to attack on all fronts - production,
distribution and cinema exhibition, accompanied by merchandising. In TV
I want the integration [created by] having a satellite channel,
software production [facilities], distribution and marketing," Modi
explains. "An entertainment product should be bought for every possible
window - pay-TV, free-TV, cable, you name it. I expect the linkages
that I am now forging between the various elements of entertainment to
generate 40% to 50% savings."

Indeed, neither the Hindujas, Zee TV or Business India TV can boast
portfolios as large as the Modi Group, as all three focus on one, two,
or at the most three different facets of the entertainment business.
Zee is involved in software production, runs three satellite channels,
operates an amusement park and produces films and music. The Hindujas
are at present only involved in cable TV but have intentions to expand
into publishing, satellite TV, movie production, multiplexes and
entertainment parks.

As yet the Modi Entertainment Group has not diversified into amusement
parks, the music business or radio, but no one would be surprised if it
didn't make a foray into each of these in the future. "Let the policies
become clearer," says executive director Rajiv Sahai.

Lalit Modi believes life in the entertainment lane is just starting.
"By the time this article comes out I'll have struck a few more deals,"
he says. "Currently I am looking at direct-to-home in a big way, but so
are several others like [PanAmSat via] PAS-4, Hughes, and Rupert
Murdoch. For all you know, I may tie up with one of them at some stage.
I have allocated $200 to $300 million to be invested in entertainment
over the next three years. I'd like the group to be a major force in
the Indian marketplace. So far we have delivered. Time will tell
whether we'll succeed."

MARRIAGE MADE IN HEAVEN

The Modi Group's market knowledge and financial acumen has attracted
the attention of the world's leading entertainment companies, writes
Anil Wanvari

The essence of the Modi Entertainment Group lies in the number of
global alliances CEO Lalit Modi has created. However, this is in-
keeping with the company's overall philosophy. Founder Gujar Mal Modi
once said when you don't have certain know-how you should take it from
a foreign company. And grandson Lalit is certainly following that
advice.

"We have 42 joint ventures in the Modi group as a whole. As far as
entertainment goes we knew we wanted to get in but we didn't understand
it. It was a new business for India and we didn't have the technology,
whereas the foreign partner did," he explains.

So far Modi has surrendered a majority (51%) stake in the Disney joint
venture, which has already spawned two subsidiaries, and has given away
50% in three of its other six entertainment companies.

"Thanks to these partnerships we've got faster to market and in turn
have given them our understanding of the Indian market and
infrastructure," he says.

Modi's first chance at an entertainment partnership came in 1993 when
the conglomerate inked a deal with Walt Disney to set-up Walt Disney
(India). "Disney had just completed a licence agreement with a small
Indian company and approached us, among several other companies, for a
tie-up," recalls Lalit Modi. "We pursued them with great motivation, we
were prepared to take on losses for some time and put in a great deal
of effort behind building up the business. All this is probably what
drove us together."

Formed to act as a vehicle for further Disney investments in India, the
joint venture soon spawned its first wholly-owned subsidiary: Walt
Disney Consumer Products (India) to look after the merchandising and
licensing of Disney products.

So far Walt Disney Consumer Products (India) has finalised licensing
deals with about 42 Indian companies.

Walt Disney (India's) second venture, Buena Visa Television (India),
was set-up to take responsibility for programme distribution and
marketing, with access to the huge library of series, animation shorts,
educational software and films from the animated giant and other
affiliated studios such as Hollywood Pictures, Touchstone, Caravan and
Miramax.

"Their professionalism and their commitment to quality encouraged us to
take them on as partners," says Disney's Hong Kong-based marketing and
communications manager, Rose Leng. "We saw eye-to-eye. They also enjoy
a unique relationship with Doordarshan."

Modi's relationship with the state-owned broadcaster has not only
helped Doordarshan fight the onslaught of foreign satellite channels
like Star TV, but has succeeded in reaping rewards all round: Today
Disney shows are broadcast on both DDI and DDII and, for Buena Vista TV
itself, such deals have contributed towards revenues which reached Rs52
million ($14 million) in 1994, of which Rs14.8 million was profit.

Close on the heels of the Buena Vista TV formation, Modi also signed
deals for the rights to distribute Disney films to India, Sri Lanka,
Nepal and Bangladesh under the guise of Modi Films, another 100% Modi-
owned company.

And, although movie-going in India has been on the wane, Modi
Entertainment is trying to change that. Via a 50/50 joint venture with
United Artists Theatre Circuit, the company is looking at setting up
multiplex theatre chains in all the major metros, at a cost of Rs150 to
Rs200 per site.

Another 100%-owned venture, Home Communications, has also been actively
acquiring the rights to TV software, including 300 Hindi film titles
and a few overseas English productions. Home Communications is also
looking at co-producing programming for television, the fruits of which
will be sold to broadcasters including Modi's joint venture Disney
Channel.

For Modi, software opportunities lead naturally to channel
opportunities and greater returns. But only if the right revenue
streams are tapped. "Advertising in India is not growing fast enough to
sustain the explosion in free-to-air channels," says Lalit Modi. "So I
was convinced the key to the Indian TV market would be distribution,
and via the pay-TV route."

And that is where his next venture, Modi Entertainment Network (MEN),
comes in. Headed by marketing veteran Tony D'Siliva, MEN is relying on
Modi's existing network of 2000 salesmen and 50 national distributors
to get into the cable TV distribution and subscriber management
businesses, albeit in a rather unique way.

Says Lalit Modi: "Most of the distributors have children who have come
of age and are looking for new businesses to enter. They are respected
in their towns and have influence. I'm offering the children the option
to manage collections for pay-TV from operators and service them and
distribute decoders."

The distributors are expected to set-up separate outfits with their
servicing field force and will work in conjunction with a dedicated MEN
staff of 150 to collect subscriptions revenue. Modi group salesmen will
conduct household audits to confirm whether the satellite feed is
actually being retransmitted by the cable operator. D'Silva expects MEN
to be involved in 100 cities by the end of Year One.

Such efforts seem to be already bearing fruit: in December 1994
sportscaster ESPN signed MEN to be its exclusive Indian distributor.

"There are few companies in India that know as much about the media
business as these guys," says ESPN Asia managing director Sandy Brown.

Brown says Modi will be involved in all facets of the channel's
distribution and operation from the distribution of decoders to the
subscriber management and revenue collection. And although ESPN is
currently doing all the customisation of the channel itself - it is
providing between eight to 12 hours of dubbed Hindi-language
programming a day, in addition to producing local wrap-arounds - Brown
says he isn't ruling out Modi getting involved in the production
process itself.

ESPN is keen to test the market for pay-TV in India. Set to launch in
mid-October, the ESPN India channel will be one of only two pay-TV
services targeting the Subcontinent, the first being Star Movies.
However, at the time of writing, the two companies have had to change
tack, having made the decision to offer the service free-to-air for a
short while as a promotional ploy.

Lalit Modi says this is a deliberate strategy: "I'd like cable
operators and viewers to get a taste of the quality of programming ESPN
can provide," he says. "Once they become aware, I'm sure they'll be
willing to pay for it."

But observers say the company hasn't managed to get its pay-TV
management act together and has failed to get enough cable operators on
its side, in addition to falling short with the required number of
decoders. The truth may lie somewhere in between. Indian cable
operators are averse to coughing up cash for decoders and don't like to
reveal their true subscriber bases due to heavy government levies.

ESPN's Brown is not unrealistic about the task ahead. "Collecting the
revenue is not going to be an easy task, the operators are not used to
paying for services and their sheer number and distance apart will make
things difficult. But if anyone has got the distribution network to
pull it off it is the Modis."

Lalit Modi is also unperturbed: "The decoders are not the problem. We
have everything in place, but we will only go ahead when the timing is
right," adding that MEN is pursuing further deals with other
broadcasters for pay-TV distribution.

The efforts may well be worth while as indications point to big
returns. If MEN can persuade even five million of India's 15 million
cable homes to pay Rs5 a month, the numbers will work out at Rs300
million a year. And that's just for starters, reckons Modi.

What may be some time off, however, is the widely-speculated Modi-
Disney pay-TV movie channel, to be delivered via PAS-4. According to
Disney's Rose Leng, the entertainment conglomerate has no immediate
plans for India. "India is just one of several Asian markets we are
examining. We have to find the right programming format and partners,"
she says. "We'll just leave the transponder that we have booked there;
we are not going to rush in."

The explanation from the Modi side is that the satellite channel has
been delayed because the group is still doing research into the Indian
market. "We are reviewing the possibilities together, we can't afford
to make mistakes," says Lalit Modi. "The viewer gives you only one
chance in the TV business."

Modi's ability and willingness to carefully research its market is an
attribute that attracted the attention of New World Entertainment, one
of two U.S companies with which Modi has set-up shared equity ventures,
the other being Multimedia Enterprises.

"Research into the TV viewer has been spotty in India in terms of both
quantitative and qualitative research," says New World's John Cuddihy.
"But the Modis have gone out on their own and produced some excellent-
quality research we have access to."

The purpose of New World Modi (India) is to create opportunities in the
TV business on a number of fronts in which distribution of the existing
catalogue, original production and channel development are all being
evaluated. However, Cuddihy says that of them all, channel development
is probably of least interest. "Although we wouldn't necessarily turn
our backs on a situation that included hardware, our mandate in India
at the moment is to work on the software," he says. Currently, Modi-New
World India has taken slots on DDII for the long-running soap Valley of
The Dolls, which is being stripped five times a week.

According to Ethan Podell, executive vice-president of Multimedia
Enterprises, his company approached Modi for a partnership: "The group
is a sophisticated business entity. They have a good grasp of the media
business."

Podell envisages the venture producing U.S-style talk shows for the
Indian market, albeit with a local focus. Work on one daytime show has
already started and should be ready in the next six months.

"We don't know how long it's going to take to make money in the Indian
market but all our markets are revenue-driven," says Podell. "We are
optimistic."

And that's exactly what has made Modi Entertainment Group the darling
of the western media world. Says Lalit Modi: "When we were discussing
with Disney, we were willing to work their way and we were motivated
and persevering. For every venture we had to approach them afresh. In
some of the ventures I'm aware we will take four years to break even;
in some we are already making profits. I have a vision: that the Modi
Entertainment Group is to emerge as a major player in the Indian
market."

LAWS UNTO THEMSELVES

The second part of Cable & Satellite Asia's A-Z guide to regulation. By
Janine Stein

Korea

Regulatory bodies and laws: Since December 1994, the licensing
authority has been the Ministry of Information and Communications
(MOIC). The previous authority, the

Ministry of Information (MOI), now makes recommendations to the MOIC.
All cable companies are required to join the Korean Cable Television
Association (KCTA). Programming standards and practices are set by the
Korean Cable Communications Commission (KCCC). Laws governing
television include the Telecommunications Business Law, the Cable TV
Law, the Satellite Communications Law (draft) and the Satellite
Broadcasting Law (draft). Satellite laws are being drafted to deal with
the use of satellites after the launch of KoreaSat.

Uplink/downlink: No company is allowed to establish uplink or downlink
facilities except for Korea Telecom (KT) and DACOM. Uplink/downlink
agreements between cable network service-providers and foreign
satellite operators have to be rubber-stamped by the Ministry of
Information and Communication.

Foriegn ownership/cross media ownership: The government has adopted a
tripartite framework for cable TV. This consists of system operators
(defined geographically), programmers (defined by genre) and signal
transporting providers (network operators). Cross-ownership among the
three is prohibited by the Cable TV Law. Foreign companies and large
domestic business conglomerates, such as Hyundai, Samsung and Daewoo,
are supposedly prohibited from participating in system operating and
signal transporting, although they are heavily involved indirectly.
Foreign investment is limited to 15% in the TV programmers category.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: The Copyright Law
protects foreign broadcasts and cable retransmissions.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Advertising time can be no longer
than 10 minutes per hour, with a maximum of six minutes per hour on the
children's channel. Programmes cannot be interrupted by advertising
more than four times in two hours, and ad breaks, depending where they
fall in the schedule, are regulated in terms of length and content.

Reception and distribution rules: Private satellite TV reception is
officially banned. This will change with the launch of KoreaSat though.

Programming rules and content restrictions: Cable TV channels have
strict foreign content restrictions, varying from 10% for arts and
culture, and 20% for educational programming, to 50% for science and
technology and documentaries. Movies, foreign programming, cartoons and
commercials have to adhere to certain content standards.

Contact: Ministry of Information and Communications, Tel: 82 2 720
4929; Korean Cable TV Association, Tel: 82 2 735 6511, Fax: 82 2 735-
6514

Malaysia

Regulatory bodies and laws: Ministry of Energy, Telecoms and Posts,
Ministry of Information. The power to grant broadcasting licences lies
with the Ministry of Information. Regulations regarding satellite
services are contained in the Telecommunications Act of 1950 and the
Broadcasting Act of 1988. Malaysia's legislation is being amended in
response to new technological advancements such as uplinking services
and public reception of satellite broadcast signals.

Uplink/downlink: Uplinking is possible through the Telecommunications
Department. This restriction will be revised under the new regulations.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: The 1974 guidelines require
foreign individuals acquiring 15% or more of voting powers, or groups
acquiring 30% or more, to apply for permission from the Foreign
Investment Committee (FIC). Alternatively, if the acquisition by
foreign interests in a Malaysian company is worth more than $M5 million
($2 million), irrespective of percentage, companies will require the
approval of the FIC. There is no separate defined policy for the
telecommunications sector, although there are expectations that the
development of cable and satellite networks by foreign companies will
require joint ventures with local companies. There are currently no
specific rules on cross-media ownership.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Broadcasts are governed
by the Copyright Act of 1987. The material must be original, first
published in Malaysia, or broadcast from Malaysia. With some
exceptions, broadcasts from outside Malaysia are not entitled to
protection.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Details of requirements on cable
are not yet confirmed. There are severe restrictions on the content and
production of advertisements.

Reception and distribution rules: Dishes were banned in 1992 to prevent
Malaysia receiving unsuitable foreign channels. This ruling is expected
to be overturned when amendments to the broadcasting and
telecommunications acts are tabled before Parliament this year.

Programming rules and content restrictions: The Malaysian government is
softening its hard-line attitude towards foreign programming. The
Ministry Of Information is conducting a study to determine the kind of
programmes suitable for television, video-tapes and cinemas. It will
also look into a rating system and a broadcasting code of ethics.

Philippines

Regulatory bodies and laws: The regulatory bodies are the Department of
Transport and Communications, the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC), and the Kapisnan ng mga Brodkaster (KBP). Cable
regulations are works-in-progress at the moment. Main industry body,
the Philippine Cable Television Association, is expected to shortly
submit its recommendations to the government.

Uplink/downlink: Licences to establish uplinking facilities are issued
by the NTC. Various construction and equipment permits are also
required. However companies have to prove the current facilities
provided by the satellite communications service-providers do not not
meet their requirements. Foreign broadcasters do not require permits to
downlink to cable operators, providing the signals do not originate in
the Philippines.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Under current regulations,
foreign investment in the cable industry - classified as broadcast
media - is not allowed. Reclassification is expected to take place this
year. If reclassified as telecommunications, the foreign investment
ceiling will be 40%. There is a possibility cable may be classified and
regulated separately with a 30% ceiling on foreign investment. There
are foreign ownership restrictions on the ownership of uplink
facilities too.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Piracy is a problem,
although efforts are being made to encourage cable operators to adhere
to rules. But fines for offenders are low. Many cable systems are video-
driven, using unlicensed tapes and unauthorised retransmission of taped
satellite programmes.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Except for institutional
advertising, cable TV is not officially allowed to carry advertising.
In reality, cable operators are carrying up to four minutes of ads per
hour. In return for carrying institutional ads, cable operators are
awarded tax credits.

Reception and distribution rules: None

Programming rules and content restrictions: The Philippines has no
restrictions on foreign programming content. Cable operators rely on
acquired programming because they aren't supposed to produce their own.
Cable operators are obliged to carry the terrestrial broadcasters.

Contact: National Telecommunications Commission, Tel: 63 2 924 3744.
Fax: 63 2 921 7128.

Singapore

Regulatory bodies and laws: The Singapore Broadcasting Authority (SBA)
is a statutory authority under the Ministry of Information and the
Arts, which regulates and licenses the broadcasting industry in
Singapore. Broadcasting services are governed by the Singapore
Broadcasting Act 1994. Video-on-demand is classified as a broadcasting
service and is subject to SBA licensing requirements. The SBA is
responsible for regulating broadcasting services content. The
Telecommunications Authority Of Singapore (TAS) is responsible for
regulating broadcasting delivery systems.

Uplink/downlink: To uplink satellite signals from Singapore,
broadcasters need a satellite broadcasting licence issued by the SBA.
Broadcasters who want to operate their own uplink facilities need a
licence issued by the TAS. To be granted a satellite broadcasting
licence, broadcasters have to ensure their service is acceptable and
complies with local laws in recipient countries. Once satisfied, the
SBA will give its approval in principle within two weeks. The actual
licence takes a month to issue. There are several incentive schemes,
such as the Pioneer Status scheme, granted to broadcasters who choose
Singapore as their base. These are incentive tax packages based on the
type of activity and amount of investment made. Satellite broadcasters
can uplink their services through a common carrier like Singapore
Telecom, SIMCOM, or ST Teleport. They can also operate their own uplink
facilities either individually or in joint-ownership with other
broadcasters.

Foreign/cross media ownership restrictions: None

Intellectual property and copyright protection: A number of laws
protect intellectual property. These include the Copyright Act, the
Trademarks Act and the Patent Act. Cable operators have to obtain
copyright authorisation for programming.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Cable advertising is restricted to
14 minutes per hour. There are no restrictions on satellite
advertising.

Reception and distribution rules: Private dish installation and usage
is banned. Businesses can apply to the SBA to receive DTH services.

Programming rules and content restrictions: There are no language or
foreign programme restrictions on cable or satellite TV. The cable TV
system is required to carry the local terrestrial channels on its
network.

Planning, Tel: 65 373 0803 Fax: 65 278 6009

Taiwan

Regulatory bodies and laws: Regulatory bodies are the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications and the Government Information Office
(GIO). Revisions to the Broadcasting and Television Law are pending.
Taiwan's first Cable TV Law was passed in 1993.

Uplink/downlink: Foreign broadcasters are not allowed to uplink from
Taiwan. This could change under the new legislation.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Draft regulations may allow
49% foreign investment in satellite companies. Foreign investment in
cable has to be indirect.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: A new copyright law has
been drafted to bring Taiwan into line with GATT standards. The draft
law clarifies the definition of broadcast but does not specifically
address the protection of unencrypted signals. At the moment,
protection is offered to works by nationals of the U.S., Hong Kong,
Switzerland, the UK and, in certain cases, Korea and Spain.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Ads are allowed to occupy 10% of
broadcasting time on cable. There are no restrictions on satellite.

Reception and distribution rules: Broadcasts are mostly unregulated.

Programming rules and content restrictions: Content guidelines are very
general, mainly for the protection of children. There are no language
restrictions. 20% of the cable programming mix has to be locally-
produced. The GIO is planning a Satellite Broadcast Law which will give
it authority to control content. At the moment, the GIO uses the
Broadcasting and Television Law's provisions on programme production
and distribution. As most foreign suppliers of satellite programmes
fall beyond the reach of local authorities, there are indications that
the local authorities will attempt to control foreign programming
through cable operators carrying the programmes.

357-0016.

Thailand

Regulatory bodies and laws: The Broadcasting Law covers all
broadcasting in Thailand, with separate regulations for cable.
Satellite TV has no regulations of its own. The Public Relations
Department (PRD) is the broadcasting regulatory body.

Uplink/downlink: Uplink facilities require a licence under the amended
Radio and Television Act, which covers the provision of radio or
television services for the public. The licences are issued by the
Department of Posts and Telecommunications. A company establishing
uplink or downlink facilities has to be majority Thai-owned. The Alien
Business Law restricts foreign involvement in certain activities;
including operating uplinking facilities.

Foreign ownership/cross media ownership: Broadcasting licence
applications have to be submitted by Thai nationals with offices in
Thailand. In ordinary registered partnerships, partners must be Thai
nationals. In limited partnerships, the partner with unlimited
liability must hold Thai nationality and not less than 50% of the
company's capital must be held by Thai nationals.

Intellectual property and copyright protection: Perhaps surprisingly,
given the proliferation of pirated  goods in Thailand, foreign
broadcasts and cable retransmission of foreign broadcasts are protected
under the Thai copyright law.

Advertising on cable and satellite: Thailand's pay-TV services are not
allowed to carry advertising. Content is dictated by the PRD.

Reception and distribution rules: Private ownership of satellite dishes
is allowed. Pay-TV companies have to obtain a licence from either the
Mass Communications Organisation of Thailand (MCOT) or the PRD.

Programming rules and content restrictions: There are no foreign
programme quotas. Programmes cannot be insulting to anyone, especially
Thai Royalty, heads of state or government officials. Religion has to
be respected, as does the public order, national unity and
international relationships. Obscene and cruel footage is banned.
Foreign television production crews have to obtain official permission
to shoot in Thailand.

BIG MONEY, BIG PLANS

Malaysia's foray into cable and satellite has begun with two consortia
competing for market share. Sarah Walker reports

"We are about to make a quantum leap," said Malaysia's minister of
information about the imminent arrival to his country of pay-TV, which
will enable the 22 million-strong population to tune into around 25
channels of TV, compared to the current choice of just four. But it
will be a controlled leap. Far from heralding the beginning of an open-
skies policy, there is every sign Prime Minister Mohammed Mahathir -
concerned about the effect uncensored western satellite channels could
have on Malaysia's national culture and identity - will preside
carefully over the emergence of cable and DTH.

So far two companies have been given licences to develop a secondary
television market in Malaysia. One, Cableview Services Sdn Bhd, has
already soft-launched part of its five-channel MMDS service called Mega
TV (see box). The other, Measat Broadcast Network Services (MBNS), will
launch its 20-channel DTH service mid-1996, utilising Ku-band capacity
on the country's first domestic satellite, Measat One.

Although Cableview Services has cash-rich shareholders, its level of
investment in pay-TV comes nowhere near that being earmarked by its
satellite-delivered competitor. However, both Measat and MBNS are part
of a much wider effort to construct a modern technological
infrastructure in Malaysia. Measat is owned and operated by Binariang
Sdn Bhd, a private telecommunications company in turn owned 20% by the
U.S. Baby Bell US West and 80% by Malaysian shareholders, including the
influential business tycoon Ananda Krishnan. The Malaysian shareholders
in turn wholly own MBNS, giving it sister company status to Binariang.

Binariang itself, far from just being a satellite operator, has a
complete range of authorisations from the Malaysian government to
establish a fully-integrated, multimedia network operating under the
corporate identity name of Maxis. This includes the setting up of a
cellular phone system, the construction of fixed broadband networks
and, of course, the launching and operation of Measat.

So far two Measats have been planned and will be co-located at 91.5
degrees, although eight orbital slots have been filed in total. Measat
One will launch in December 1995, while Measat Two is tentatively
scheduled for October 1996. Both will be put into orbit by the French
launcher Arianespace.

Measat One's payload will be comprised of 12 36MHz transponders at C-
Band and five, 54MHz transponders at Ku-Band. The C-Band footprint will
cover the whole of the Asia Pacific, as far west as the east coast of
India as far south as northern Australia, north to Mongolia and east as
far as Guam. Ku-Band capacity, meanwhile, will provide spot beam
coverage over Malaysia, the Philippines and India.

Although the same model as the first craft, Measat Two is likely to be
configured differently with three 76MHz C-Bands transponders, in
addition to 12 at Ku-Band. Measat Two's Ku capacity will also be
extended to provide coverage of Java, Queensland and Vietnam.

"The satellite payload is quite flexible, we can switch transponders
between the different beams," says Maxis's Steven Corda. "We are
looking at targeting emerging countries, to be there when they require
a service," he continues. "For instance, we have one transponder that
can be switched to Vietnam, providing five to 10 channels of
programming."

Although the satellite operator and the programming arm operate as
separate entities, the commonality of ownership ensures that synergies
exist. While C-Band capacity on both satellites is available for hire,
all the Ku capacity has been leased exclusively to MBNS so that it can
provide DTH services initially to Malaysia, but potentially to all the
different regions covered by the spot beams.

For Malaysia itself, MBNS has initially been licensed to provide a 20-
channel DTH package receivable with 50cm dishes. According to Paul
Edwards, MBNS's chief operating officer, channels in the package will
be a combination of international and locally-produced services. "We
will probably have two local channels initially," says Edwards, whose
staff are now in the process of acquiring shows and commissioning local
productions. Eventually, MBNS will have the capability to produce its
own programming once construction has been completed of the Asia
Broadcast Centre, a huge facility combining production, post-production
facilities and uplinking. The centre will also enable the company to
help localise the international services, in terms of providing dubbing
and subtitling and possibly even providing local programming.

"Our experience is that local programming often drives the pay-TV
packages and that often international channels by themselves have not
always been especially successful in some markets," says Edwards. "So
we are looking at a combination of local driver channels packaged with
top-quality international channels that have an element of
localisation."

Although contracts have yet to be signed, programmers who have
confirmed they are in discussions for carriage as part of the DTH
package include the Discovery Channel, ESPN, CNNI, TNT/Cartoon Network
and Asia Business News.

With such services previously unwelcome in Malaysia, Edwards says a lot
of focus is being channelled towards the issue of censorship, "to
ensure that whatever we broadcast will be acceptable," he says. "We are
still evaluating those standards but have employed some very advanced
technology which will allow us to delay the transmission of content,
subject to the usual permissions of the programme owners."

CNNI for one will broadcast to Malaysia on a two-hour delay basis to
give local censors plenty of time to cut out any offending programme
material.

With the launch of the DTH package still some eight to 10 months off,
Edwards says negotiations are still underway with MPEG-2/DVB-compliant
compression technology suppliers. Also still being evaluated is the
pricing structure. "We are still doing research into the market as to
what acceptance levels are," he says. Although a more comprehensive
channel package, coupled with the high cost of digital decoders, is
likely to push the price up to at least twice that of Mega TV, say
industry experts.

Utilising compression rates of at least 10 to one and perhaps even
higher on each of the 17 Ku transponders provided by both Measat One
and Two, MBNS will be able to provide in the region of 150 DTH
channels, split between the satellites' several spot beams. "We will
not necessarily beam services into each of those countries but have the
capacity to do so," says Edwards. "And because the beams are switchable
to a degree we can allocate transponder capacity to certain markets as
the need arises." Although Edwards says the services could also be
delivered to cable headends as well as to the home, "the experience of
Europe and the U.S. shows that there is a very definite role for DTH."

Aside from Malaysia the first market to be targeted by MBNS is India,
where an MoU to deliver a multi-channel DTH service, in conjunction
with state broadcaster Doordarshan, has already been signed. Utilising
up to four transponders, a potential 40 channels will eventually be
available. "India has been a cable market until now but it has grown
very fast indeed and we think that going forward there will be a very
viable DTH market there," he says.

As regards the C-Band capacity on Measat One and Two, Maxis's Steven
Corda says Binariang is "looking to provide any type of fixed satellite
services you could imagine." The first will be a Vsat service scheduled
for the second quarter of next year, another will be telephony, with
long-distance learning another possibility. However one of the major
target markets will again be broadcasters, for distribution to
headends. "We are looking at both international and domestic
broadcasters," says Corda. "Say if the domestic broadcaster wanted to
make its programming available in Indonesia, or Mindanao in the
Philippines where there is a large Bahasa Malaysia-speaking
population... When you look at the coverage, we cover just about all of
Asia Pacific and the power levels are quite large, so we can run two
analogue channels per transponder at high quality, effectively doubling
the amount of programming you can see on our satellite versus some of
the others," he continues.

Corda views all the other regional satellites as Measat's direct
competition, but doesn't believe it is a major issue.

"Digital video and high-powered transponders have lowered the cost for
individual uses such that we are now getting a whole new market
segment," he says. "Now instead of just the $1.5 million to $2 million
a year for a transponder, customers can lease an eighth or a quarter,
we are now getting into the $500,000 and lower range." The cost for a
full C-Band transponder on Measat will be $1.9 million a year.

For Binariang though it is the construction of the fixed broadband
network that is seen as potentially the largest revenue-earner. The
company is to invest R$2.9 million in its development over the next
five years. So far two deals have been signed for the construction of
hybrid fibre/co-axial systems, with the aim being to capture an 8%
market share by the year 2000.

Edwards see synergies for MBNS and Binariang in this area too. "Such a
state-of-the-art system will allow for VOD and interactive
programming... we see ourselves as a content-provider," he says.

MEGA TV: NO SECOND BEST

With a population starved of choice yet relatively affluent, received
wisdom is that the time is right for pay-TV in Malaysia. But do
Malaysians need two services? The answer, according to both MBNS and
competitor Mega TV, would appear to be yes.

Although MBNS's proposed pay-TV plan is impressive, the country's
second pay-TV licensee, Mega TV, will still have an eight-month lead
over its DTH-delivered competitor, and decidedly lower overheads.

Test-launched in September with a four-channel package - comprised of
CNNI, Cartoon Network, Discovery Channel, and ESPN - Mega TV will begin
its full, five-channel service in November with the arrival of HBO
Asia. At this time viewers will be required to begin paying for the
package.

According to CEO Shamsul Khalid Ismail, the total cost of the service
includes an installation fee of R$260 ($104) to R$450, depending on the
type of property, a R$135 decoder deposit fee - the decoders are given
out free of charge, but on loan - and a monthly fee of R$45. For this,
subscribers will get four 24-hour channels, plus a fifth channel
incorporating 14-hours of the Cartoon Network, broadcasting from 08.00
to 18.00, plus locally-packaged general entertainment programming,
broadcasting from 20.00 to 01.00.

Operated by Cableview Services which in turn is owned by a consortium
of five companies, including private broadcaster TV3 (40%) and the
minister of finance (30%), Mega TV is initially targeting the wealthy
Klang Valley area of Malaysia, which incorporates Kuala Lumpur. Target
households are those with incomes exceeding $1,500 a month. And
although Mega TV is allowed to sell three minutes of commercial airtime
per hour on all channels except HBO, its main revenue is expected to
come from subscriptions.

While it is likely all of the channels distributed by Mega TV will end
up on Measat as well, Mega is playing on the cost factor. "We know
their service will be a lot more expensive," says Ismail. "They will
have to target the R$3000 a month income bracket." And by the time
Measat's DTH service is up-and-running, Mega TV will have expanded
beyond its initial coverage area.

With a nationwide licence, the plan is to expand coverage as quickly as
possible, using the same MMDS delivery. Channel capacity could also be
extended to around 12, and even more, should digital MMDS be
implemented. This, says Ismail, could render it unnecessary to invest
in other forms of delivery, such as hard wire cable, because digital
MMDS would allow compression of the existing channels.

Having invested R$110 million to date, breakeven point, says Ismail, is
50,000 subscribers. "We have the capacity to install about 40,000
dishes a month, so it is possible we could recoup by year end," he
says.

A CRISIS OF IDENTITY

Cable TV in the Philippines is a growth industry, but regulatory issues
need to be resolved before it can reallydevelop. By Sarah Walker

The Philippines may be home to one of Asia's lesser developed economies
but its cable system is surprisingly well developed and, coupled with
interest from overseas investors, is growing rapidly.

A country with a population of 66 million, there are currently 5.5
million TV households in the Philippines. To date, cable has passed
over 40% of TV homes and there are an estimated 300,000 to 350,000
subscribers. Projections for the year 2000 are over one million.

The Philippines Cable TV Association (PCTA), an efficient industry body
formed in 1987 with six charter members, now numbers 216, although the
number of cable operators that have received cable licences from the
National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) is 320. PCTA estimates put
the total number of systems operating at between 260 and 300.

Sky Cable, the country's largest cable operator, carries 55 channels
and has a subscriber base of 120,000 (see sidebar), however most
operators carry between 10 and 20 channels and serve anything from 300
subscribers upwards.

Although monthly subscription fees, which range from P90 ($3.50) to
P430 - depending on the location of the service - are low, the ability
of most Filipinos to speak English has provided a ready-made market for
western companies.

Most of the major satellite broadcasters are carried on Filipino cable
systems, including ESPN, TNT/Cartoon Network, HBO Asia, The Discovery
Channel and Star TV. Operators receive the services from satellites
such as Palapa B2P, PAS-2 and Apstar 1, and, like Indonesia, the
geography of the Philippines means most of the major VHF and UHF-
delivered broadcasters such as ABS-CBN and GMA 7 are also carried via
satellite and then relayed by cable. In outlying areas where
terrestrial reception is poor this has resulted in a big demand for
cable TV.

However, in the bigger cities, where UHF and VHF signals can easily be
received, the demographic of the average cable viewer tends to be
higher, as in this instance cable is an add-on service, not a
necessity.

In Metro Manila for example, between 60% and 80% of viewers are in the
AB category as opposed to elsewhere, where they only number 30% of
viewers.

In addition to the relaying of foreign channels and national
broadcasters, a few locally-produced and packaged channels are also
carried. Sky Cable has three of its own, while the Hollywood Channel,
which began broadcasting off Palapa B2P in March, is a 16-hours-a-day
nationwide cable network that, according to Liza Legaspi, programme
manager, broadcasts mainly acquired U.S. programming such as Time Trax
and Lois and Clark.

Carried by about 100 cable operators, Hollywood Channel has plans to
start producing original programming soon. Its sister company, Cable
Boss, is a distributor and acts as the middle-man between  programmers
and cable operators, providing monthly figures and collecting revenue -
under-reporting of the subscriber base is still a big problem in the
Philippines.

The other major  distributors are Accion, and Yes Cable. Many of the
U.S. broadcasters use all three, as does Star TV. According to its
general manager, southeast Asia, distribution and marketing, David
Ilagan, the pan-Asian broadcaster will be launching a full Filipino
Channel, once Asiasat 2 launches.

Although the Philippines can lay claim to having built one of, if not
the first, cable system in Asia - constructed in Bagio City in 1969 -
the imposition of marshall law by the Marcos regime in 1972 put a
freeze on the telecoms and broadcasting industry. From that point on,
cable TV's development, like the country in general, stood still.

It wasn't until 1987 when the government of Cory Aquino allowed any
citizen of the Philippines to build a cable system, (as long as they
submitted the applicable technical and financial studies) that cable
began to grow again.

Now that President Fidel Ramos, who has set his sights on turning the
Philippines into a newly industrialised nation by the year 2000, cable
can really begin to develop beyond its formative stages. Or at least
that's the theory. Regulatory wrangles and legal loopholes mean that,
presently, Filipino cable does seem to be undergoing something of an
identity crisis.

Currently cable in the Philippines is classified as broadcast media,
but the NTC is formulating plans for it to be reclassified as telecoms.
Should this take place it would bring about a number of changes, the
most significant being a change in the foreign ownership ceiling from a
present zero to 40%.

Most industry observers think foreign investment is the only way cable
operators will be able to upgrade their infrastructure significantly to
compete with the country's rapidly growing telecoms market. Indeed a
number are already forming alliances with U.S. cable companies in
preparation for an easing of restrictions.

The most high-profile overseas operator is the Falcon Cable/Cavite
Cable Systems joint venture in which the U.S. company helped the cable
operator install a fully fibre-optic system. Fellow U.S. predator UIH
also has an alliance with Sun TV. Other U.S. companies thought to be
looking for strategic alliances include Time Warner and TCI.

"To go from 250,000 [subscribers] to over 2.5 million the cable
industry needs to establish stability, a level of professionalism and
vision," says Clive Flessig, vice president international, Falcon
Cable. "Telecoms will come up with a compelling argument to get into
the business... International investors are in need of a local partner
who is familiar with the environment."

There have already been some informal tie-ups between telcos and cable
companies to provide telephony over cable. To name just one, the
Philippines Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) and Manila's County Cable
Communication's Network have been testing infrastructure pairing
traditional copper wire and co-axial cable for the provision of
telephony, using U.S. company First Pacific Network's (FPN) technology.

The present telecoms bill currently allows telcos to provide cable TV
but not vice versa, therefore it is evident some changes in the law are
necessary to create a level playing field.

The PCTA recognises this but is opposed to the possibility of a
provision for cable being inserted into the Telecoms Act. Instead it is
presently drafting its own cable TV bill to put before Congress which
would classify cable as a separate entity.

While not fully against foreign ownership of cable, the PCTA is anxious
to retain the industry's autonomy and is unlikely to recommend a full
40% ceiling, perhaps opting instead for 30%, with ownership taking the
form of equity participation, but not management control.

Should cable eventually fall under the banner of telecoms, operators
will also have to apply for a Congressional Franchise before
approaching the NTC for a licence. The PCTA vehemently opposes this,
saying the cost involved would prejudice the smaller operator. Others
disagree. "If you look at the 300 or so operators pending licences,
many are mom and pop operations who really don't have enough money to
get in here and offer a reliable service. A congressional franchise
would shake out the small guys from the big guys," says a Manila-based
consultant. A Congressional licence requirement could also help limit
overbuilding, he adds. At the moment there is no limit on the number of
operators allowed per district.

Whatever the outcome of the regulatory changes, in order to develop,
the industry will need some sort of financial boost. The current move
towards consolidation will provide operators with not only more finance
for infrastructure upgrades and original programming production, but
also greater muscle with which to bargain with overseas programmers

Additional money could also come from advertising. At the moment this
too is officially banned although many systems do sell commercial
airtime.

The PCTA is currently pushing for between four and five minutes an hour
compared to the 16 minutes currently allowed on the national stations -
which in turn are opposing the proposal.

Says one cable operator: "National broadcasters view us as a possible
threat to their revenue base, but it is likely that we would be going
after the local market."

LEADER OF THE PACK

Sky Cable - the Philippines' largest operator - reaches 100,000 cable
subscribers, of which 70,000 are located in Metro Manila.

Operating a basic package of 55 channels at a cost of $16 a month, it
is one of the few operators to package and produce its own channels.
Currently numbering three, these are the I Channel, comprised of kids
fare in the daytime and adults at night, Sky Movies and a Filipino
channel that airs movies and locally-produced news and entertainment in
the local Tagalog dialect.

Sky is also the first operator in the Philippines to operate a premium
tier. Launched on July 1 after two weeks of testing as part of the
basic package, the tier is initially offering two Mandarin-language
channels: TVBS, the international arm of Hong Kong terrestrial
broadcaster TVB, at a cost of $4 and news service CTN, at a cost of $2.
There is also a one-off members' fee of $100. By year end the cable
operator hopes to be providing 10 premium channels and is thought to be
in discussions with MTV and Japanese terrestrial NHK.

According to Sky Cable general manager Mel Verlade, the premium tier is
initially aimed at the country's minority, but wealthy Chinese
population.

Sky is using General Instrument's Jerrold equipment for the service.
David Johnson, GI's Asia Pacific support manager, says the deal marks
the first fully interactive, two-way addressable system to have been
sold to the Philippines. Sky has also acquired some impulse PPV boxes
and is currently negotiating with rights-holders. Verlade said VOD is
also a possibility in the future.

Sky owns some eight cable systems nationwide and is looking for further
acquisitions. It is also in the process of laying 100km of fibre-optic
cable in  Metro Manila, with the economically-prosperous town of Cebu
the next possible target for a major infrastructure upgrade.

Owned by the Benpres Group, holding company of the locally powerful
Lopez family - whose subsidiaries include broadcaster ABS-CBN and local
telecoms operator Bayantel, in which Nynex owns a 25% stake - Sky is
not short of cash, or contacts.

ASIAN AESTHETICS

On-air identities and graphics are crucial to the branding of a
channel. Janine Stein looks at how networks are adapting their look to
suit the Far East markets

Staffers at the TNT & Cartoon Network Asia just don't talk about movie
genres anymore. The lavish Thirties swashbuckling drama, Captain Blood,
has become a "magenta." The futuristic 1970s science fiction Logan's
Run, on the other hand, is "definitely a green," according to the new
TNT-speak.

To the crew that is creating an on-air Asian identity for the classic
Hollywood channel, films have become colours and clips set to music to
create a certain mood, to encourage an emotional reaction.

This emotion is TNT's greatest weapon in the American movie channel's
battle for an Asian identity. "No-one has seen the movies and they
don't know our stars in this part of the world," says TNT's director of
programming, Andrea Miller.

But the emotions are universal: love, jealousy, greed. "All these
movies have great emotional content, great moods, great stories,"
Miller says. And TNT has translated them into colour.

While the palette the night-time channel uses reflects Asian cities
after dark, in TNT-speak blue equals light-hearted, comic and musical -
for movies like The Glass Bottomed Boat. Promos for an evening of
traditional family entertainment are gold, while screens filled with
green herald edgy, sci-fi-types like Shaft or Children of the Damned.
When the promos are purple, the movies will be darker, filled with
mystery and suspense. Magenta is reserved for grandeur, for costume
dramas and epics, for films like the Adventures of Don Juan.

If TNT has moved away from its movie icons to achieve an Asian look,
virtually all the channels have shunned traditional Asian icons in
their quest for an Asian identity.

"Anything that you would love to see on a postcard, we try to avoid,"
says David Flack, MTV's director of on-air promotions. "We're looking
for youth culture, the kinds of things that young people are interested
in."

The traditional pool of instantly-recognisable Asian images - dragons,
chop sticks, fans, jade carvings - are "kind of corny," Flack says. TNT
& Cartoon Network's creative director, Ian Diamond, calls these
cultural icons tired and jaded, and steers clear of moviedom's
equivalents - the director's chairs, the strips of film, the
spotlights.

"We wanted to create a look that was contemporary, unique and elegant;
a look that suggested the essence of Hollywood yet avoided Western or
Asian movie cliches," Diamond says.

In contrast to the channel's nostalgic tone in Latin America, TNT
Asia's pitch aims to "appear timeless, not too attached to particular
faces, styles, or periods... we will sell the emotions, energy and
dynamics of Hollywood." It's a concept created in the U.S. For their
new Asian image unveiled earlier this year, TNT went to New York-based
design firm PMCD.

"It was a case of people for the job," Diamond says. But he insists
local artists have as much chance of participating in the network's
ongoing creative process as anyone else. "It's a matter of artistic
talent."

TNT's design elements include fire, water and light, a 3-D feel is
created with movie clips in multiple backgrounds and light play.

Diamond makes heavy use of what he calls "organic" (as opposed to
electronic) elements - 35mm film, original instruments, the real rather
than the virtual - to create TNT's sumptuous night-time feel. Although
he later processes the images on 3-D particle animation using SGI
Wavefront software, he sets great store by their "real foundation."

Just in case the subtle messages are missed, TNT has taken out an on-
screen insurance policy - the word "movie" running in different
languages at the bottom of the screen. "This avoids disruptions to the
basic look and feel but successfully delivers a simple and direct
message to viewers," TNT says.

In a much more powerful programming position, the Discovery Channel is
less esoteric about the on-air image it is forging in Asia. Saffron-
robed monks, the sun rising over a Buddha, traffic in Bangkok,
Sukhothai, plus lots of Asian faces and places are all part of the on-
air promotions and fillers. Each market has its own promos and
interstitials. "We are bringing people their own cities, something to
identify with, pieces of everyday life," says director of on-air
promotions, Susan Seelandt.

The images are set to original music on traditional instruments - a
route also favoured by Asia Business News (ABN). "It's much softer, and
the melodies are Asia-specific," says ABN's deputy managing editor,
Jeremy Pink.

CNBC Asia also aims to echo on-screen pieces of its viewers lives. At
the same time as avoiding the "hard-nosed aggressive approach," the
channel brings images of the way Asia does business to the screen.
Exchanging business cards, greetings, scenes of industry, of stock
exchanges, "things that are typical and obviously Asian, but not
stereotypical," says Robert Wilson, director of network distribution
and marketing.

Creating an identity that works is an imprecise science in such a new
arena. Apart from the obvious don'ts, such as being careful with images
of pigs and pork for Muslim audiences - and that means no Porky Pig on
the Cartoon Network - the creators of on-air promos for Asia are mostly
still easing into the market.

At the Discovery Channel, Asian graphics are currently being phased in
to take the place of graphics from the U.S. "We are in the process of
Asianising the look," Seelandt says.

Next year, when the channel launches its Bahasa and Japanese services,
new graphics with an Asian colour palette using reds and golds will
replace the flourescents and light colours of the U.S.-generated
images. The graphics will be commissioned from Asian artists. "These
are the people who are going to be watching. They know better what will
make people happy," Seelandt says.

While even Asian-based channels such as Asia Business News has not left
colour choices to chance, the global channel least concerned with an
Asian colour palette is MTV.

"We use every colour of the rainbow, sometimes all at once," Flack
says. "The designers are locals, and we're dealing with a young
audience which is less concerned about auspicious colours than older
audiences. We trust them. We have sat down to discuss the wisest kind
of design, but we haven't gone into colour details because that comes
naturally."

Bowing to Asian tastes has been less in the form of content and more in
feel. "We have gone out of our way here to soften the packaging and
promotions," Flack says. "There are fewer cuts than there would be in
the U.S. and Europe, and the whole thing is softer. It's still really
powerful, but the pace is a little easier on the eye."

With a choice of 300 to 400 station IDs, "if someone doesn't like one
of our IDs, a new one will be on in a couple of minutes," Flack says.
Obviously, all efforts are made not to offend anyone. "There was one ID
which has a guy eating a freshly-roasted pig, which we obviously didn't
screen."

Most of MTV's IDs are from the U.S. The Asian operation, launched in
April, has produced three so far, although they have come up with a
swathe of image promos. "We only make IDs when we find very good
subjects," Flack says.

Although he makes heavy use of local talent in producing on-air promos,
one of the problems Flack has "is that people come up with things they
think we want. We have to ask them to think beyond that... If producers
are making something for a Taiwan audience, they have to think about
things from a Taiwan perspective. But it doesn't necessarily have to
feature a Taiwanese thing." Having injected the MTV attitude, "the best
thing for me to do is to take a back seat" and let locals get on with
it, Flack says.

Apart from the language, differentiating MTV Asia from MTV Mandarin is
easy: Although both have the kind of laid-back cool MTV cherishes, MTV
Asia's attitude is less gentle, the humour less black. An MTV Mandarin
image promo will have some dude with wire coat-hangers rigged to his
head as antennas for the MTV signal. On MTV Asia, a skeleton in a
suitcase and a gun show up on an airline's X-ray conveyor belt.

Whatever the routes they've chosen to take in establishing their Asian
credentials, in every case there's a need for international programmers
to meld modern Asian elements - a face, a skyline, a city street - with
internationally established channel brands.

"We are giving a local version of something that people want, in much
the same way as they want other products from abroad," Flack says. "We
make it local, but it still has to be MTV. It still has to be part of
the world network."

ESPN takes that thinking further. ESPN Asia's general manager for
programming and production, John Davies, calls ESPN "a universal brand"
with a distinctive graphic style that runs through all the networks.
"The network ID is just ESPN. The look is recognisable. We're not
putting Mickey Mouse ears on anything."

It's the same line Turner is taking with Cartoon Network, which is sold
in Asia with TNT. "Donald Duck is universal," they say.

Like the Discovery Channel and others who are customising with
subtitling and voice dubbing, ESPN's programming, language, and
promotions will be tailored for different markets. However, Davies
insists, "we are not branding the channel Asian. We are not trying to
identify ourselves as anything - just ESPN... Colour is not something
we concern ourselves with."

With its universally popular sports content and its proven record even
in Asia's most difficult markets, ESPN's identity requires a lot less
physical effort than TNT's at this stage. As the movie channel found in
Malaysia, sometimes, no amount of colour, mood or manipulation will
work. New MMDS service, Mega TV, which launches later this year, gave
the nod to the Cartoon Network and the flick to the classic movies.
Mega TV's reason? They just aren't appropriate for a Malaysian
audience.

FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE

Casbaa is linking with Reed to bring this year's Cable & Satellite
Convention in Hong Kong (December 6-8) back to basics

A cliche it may be, but few can deny that Asia's satellite and cable
industry is growing at a rate of knots. Region-wide, almost without
exception, cable and or DTH infrastructures are rapidly being
developed. New satellite launches providing digital capabilities will
further proliferate the number of channels available. Advances in
technology means Asian countries should be in the position to leapfrog
levels of development that have characterised the growth of multi-
channel environments in the U.S. and Europe.

However there is a downside to Asia's rapid development. An overall
lack of knowledge and expertise, an absence of uniform technical and
operational standards, and, in many cases a total lack of effective,
regulatory legislation has lead to incoherent and disparate growth
throughout the region.

The Cable & Satellite Asia '95 show which is to be held at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, will attempt to address some of
these issues through its convention, while allowing companies a chance
to showcase some of their products.

The show is being organised by the Cable & Satellite Broadcasting
Association of Asia (Casbaa) in conjunction with Reed Exhibition
Companies. A non-profit association set up in 1993, the aim of Casbaa
is to bring together the various parts of the industry, including
international and national programmers, hardware suppliers and cable
and DTH operators to achieve some stability and work towards achieving
common goals.

"We are a young organisation," says Bill Hooks, immediate past
president of Casbaa and HBO Asia managing director (he has been
replaced as president by Turner International's Ted McFarland). "Early
on we were looking for a reason to exist, it was necessary to define
our mission and reach a point where we could convince our members that
Casbaa could make contributions by furthering the cable and satellite
business."

The three-day convention will be the first in a series of industry
events organised by Casbaa. Hooks says the aim is for the show to
become an annual date in the diary for delegates and exhibitors not
only from the Asia-Pacific region but also the U.S. and Europe, and the
premier event for those baffled by the ever-increasing and ever-costly
number of conferences and exhibitions currently being staged in all
corners of Asia.

"There are too many conferences that look like each other and deliver
the same papers, run by for-profit companies who in our view don't
spend enough time worrying about what might be in the best interests of
attendees in terms of content and execution," says Hooks. "They are
very expensive and targeted at senior executives as opposed to what is
emerging as an industry with many different levels... to the typical
Taiwanese or Philippine cable operator the relevancy of, say, a
discussion on telephony today, given where they are in terms of cable
development, is so far removed from what they need to do as to be
irrelevant."

As such, the Casbaa conference plans to go back to basics, moving aware
from "paper-delivering panels" and more towards general sessions and
workshops on issues that are meaningful to companies attempting to
build basic cable infrastructures, such as the use of fibre in building
cable systems, or an explanation of the technical specifications needed
for the building of a modern, not overtly expensive, cable network.
Other subjects the committees have identified as possible workshop
topics include programming, marketing, on-air promotion and customer
service. General sessions will address broader issues such as market
access and copyright.

The conference will also comprise a keynote address from a well-known
industry leader.

As for the exhibition itself, which will be located on Level 7 of the
Hong Kong Conference and Exhibition centre, almost 70% of the 2,500
square metres of floor space has been booked.

MONEY BY NUMBERS

Both China and India will continue to represent major growth areas in
the Asian cable and satellite market, says telecoms consultancy MTA-
EMCI's Sam H. Book

The situation today

China has nearly 40 million cable homes representing about 13%
penetration of total households. Over 12,000, mainly low-capacity catv
systems carry between eight to 20 channels including terrestrial
broadcast stations, government channels and up to four Star TV
channels. Cable rates are about $1 per month and installation charges
come in at between $25 and $35. Reception is the primary motivation for
subscribing to cable television in China, a situation similar to
America in the 1950s and '60s when most American cable subscribers
lived in rural areas and small towns with poor off-air reception.

India, by comparison, has over 12 million cable homes which represents
approximately 7% of total Indian households and over 20% of urban
Indian households. Over 35,000 local cable systems provide
retransmission of terrestrial broadcast stations and a growing array of
satellite programming. Most Indian cable subscribers can now receive
CNNI, BBC World, Zee TV, and several Star TV services, in addition to
regional TV stations and the national state-owned broadcaster,
Doordarshan. Monthly cable subscription rates are between $3 to $5 with
installation costs about $15.

As regards the growth of satellite dishes for DTH delivery, the
statistics for China are particularly impressive. Despite an official
government ban, there are currently over one million satellite dishes
installed and additional dish sales are topping 5,000 a month.

Likewise, India also has over one million installed dishes, but the
proliferation of cable systems, each carrying most of the available
satellite programming, is inhibiting the growth of dish sales to the
home.

Projections For Tomorrow

The economics of cable television require density of homes and
households with disposable income. Hong Kong, Singapore and cities in
Japan, Taiwan, Korea and several other Asian countries are economically
viable cable markets, while areas with low population densities and low
incomes are not viable for modern, broadband systems. China's major
urban markets, especially Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou and a
few other cities in Guangdong province contain most of China's newly-
emerging middle class population, providing sufficient concentrations
of affluent households. Urban India, comprising 30% of the total
population, includes four major metropolitan centres, each with between
five to over 10 million people and about 30 cities housing between one
to five million people. MTA-EMCI estimates that between 10% to 15% of
all urban Indian households have sufficient disposable income to be
able to afford cable and satellite television.

The market for satellite television equipment and programming
incorporates both cable operators and direct-to-home (DTH) services.
Consumer demand for DTH depends again upon disposable income levels and
also the competition provided by cable services. Cable has first-mover
advantages over DTH in both China and India, especially in the upscale
urban markets. For example, recent MTA-EMCI focus studies in New Delhi
and Bombay revealed that nearly 80% of a sampling of high net worth
households subscribed to cable.

However, despite pervasive poverty, rural areas in China and India are
also promising DTH markets. If only 2% of non-urban Chinese and Indian
homes had sufficient wealth to buy satellite equipment and programming,
the non-urban potential market for DTH would be approaching three
million homes in India and five million in China.

Broadband, hybrid fibre/co-axial (HFC) cable systems are in development
in Beijing, Shanghai and in each provincial capital, but most of these
systems are still in the planning stage, and their economic viability
is uncertain. In India, agglomeration of small cable systems is
underway in New Delhi, Bombay and a few other cities. The Indian cable
industry may evolve towards the U.S. model of multiple system operators
(MSOs), or cable may remain a fragmented, locally-owned and operated
business. Much of cable's future depends on government policy and
regulation.

Based on a combination of on-site data collection, analysis of
secondary data and demographics and consumer demand modelling of cable
and satellite television, MTA-EMCI forecasts the rapid growth of cable
and satellite in both China and India.

In China, cable and satellite homes are projected to grow from about 40
million today to over 130 million in 2005. In India, cable and
satellite homes are projected to grow from 14 million today to 53
million in 2005. Cable and satellite penetration of total households is
projected to increase from 12% to 34% in China and from 8% to 25% in
India between 1995 and 2005.

MTA-EMCI, resulting from a merger of Malarkey-Taylor Associates and
EMCI, is a leading global telecommunications consultancy, with offices
in Washington DC, London and Singapore

ASIA SATELLITES TRANSPONDER WATCH

168oE: PAS-2

CNBC Asia has now replaced ANBC on 411MHz. A transponder has been hired
by TVBI to beam programmes into northeastern Asia and Taiwan.

138oE: Apstar 1

The official inquiry on the fatal crash of a Chinese Long March 2E
rocket has now been reported. Apstar 2, the sister satellite to this
one, was due to locate at or around 77 degrees East last January, but
was apparently lost when severe cross-winds above the site damaged the
fairing - the fibre-glass cover on the nose cone which encloses the
satellite. International Telecom Japan recently started a feed of
Reuters VideoNews via this satellite as the second hop from Intelsat
704, with some additional regionally-specific feeds.

113oE Palapa B2P

Australian Television, the ABC external TV service, is in serious
difficulty. Although the signals on this satellite continue, a review
of Australian global broadcasting is imminent. CNBC is in-the-clear
until October and will use Asiasat 2 next year. MTV Asia has moved into
B-Mac encryption.

116oE: Koreasat 1

Koreasat 1, a Lockheed Martin Astro Space Series 3000 satellite, is
South Korea's first domestic satellite. Launch was delayed by Hurricane
Erin and may have not achieved the correct orbit without considerable
use of the fuel reserves. The failure of a booster rocket to separate
from the Delta rocket carrying the satellite into orbit will mean a
reduced life. The additional drag created by the booster meant that the
satellite could not be delivered into its intended orbit. The launch
was at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and the launch vehicle was a
Macdonald-Douglas Delta 2 rocket. Delta 228 was the first major partial
failure of such a vehicle. The Hercules GEM solid booster, by failing
to separate, caused the first stage to deliver less velocity. The
second stage compensated by burning for 35 seconds longer than planned
on its first burn, which placed the rocket in parking orbit. The second
stage shut down early when fuel ran out. The third stage placed the
satellite in an orbit with an apogee of just 30,000km, which is below
the required 35,700km. A second satellite could provide back-up, it was
to have been put in a storage orbit until the capacity was required.

93.5oE: Insat 2B

After some false starts the DD3 channel has launched, with a schedule
of arts and current affairs programming. Insat 2C's launch will add
much-needed transponder capacity over Asia. If granted capacity, as
they hope, a growing number of international TV channels could beam via
Insat into the regional DTH and cable audience. The evidence of the
controversial deal between Doordarshan and CNN is being seen on Insat
2B. Doordarshan and CNNI have launched a joint 24-hour on this
satellite at 4160MHz vertical Tp. C12. Pakistan and Bangladseh already
have terrestrial arrangements with the 24-hour news channel.

85oE: Raduga

Business India TV, which has been reported on this satellite, is
gearing up for a move to Ekspress, which may herald another launch as
14 degrees West seems an unlikely location for such a geographically-
targeted channel. On the 3875MHz RHCP channel, BITV has been showing
TVI News - current affairs programmes - and TVI Prime entertainment.
