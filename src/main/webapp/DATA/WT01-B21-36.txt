<h1><center>Breckenridge Medical Marijuana Ordinance</center> </h1>

<hr>

<p> In April 1994, hemp activists in Breckenridge put an
initiative on their local ballot that directed the local law
enforcement to make it their lowest priority to arrest someone
for using marijuana for medicine. The initiative passed by about
50 votes. (The initiative was modeled after San Francisco's
Proposition P which passed by over 80% of the votes.) Shortly
after the Breckenridge initiative passed, the Frisco city council
adopted a similar ordinance encouraging medical marijuana
research. So now there are two towns in Summit County that have
medical marijuana ordinances. Way to go, Summit County
activists!!! </p>

<p> Here's the Breckenridge ordinance, which passed by a people's
vote. </p>

<p> The problems we had were in copying the Denver Medical MJ
Ordinance too closly. We should have researched more carefully
the chain of command in the town of Breck. It's not the mayor,
but the town manager, who tells the police chief what to do. </p>

<h2><center>Breckenridge Medical Marijuana Ordinance</center> </h2>

<p> ORDERING THE MAYOR TO DIRECT THE POLICE CHIEF AND THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO MAKE THEIR LOWEST PRIORITY THE ARREST OR
PROSECUTION OF THOSE INVOLVED IN THE POSSESSION OR CULTIVATION OF
MARIJUANA FOR PERSONAL USE FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES, AND FOR THE
DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO ALLOW A LETTER FROM A TREATING PHYSICIAN TO
BE USED A PRIMA FACIA EVIDENCE THAT MARIJUANA CAN ALLEVIATE THE
PAIN AND SUFFERING OF THAT PATIENT'S MEDICAL CONDITION, AND
INSTRUCTING THE TOWN'S REPRESENTATIVE TO LOBBY THE STATE
LEGISLATURE FOR A STATE MEDICAL MARIJUANA BILL. </p>

<p> WHEREAS, the Colorado State Legislature held hearings and
approved the medicinal use of marijuana (HB 1042; Colorado
Revised Statute 25-5-901-907); and </p>

<p> WHEREAS, &quot;hemp medical preparations&quot; are defined as
all products made from hemp, cannabis, or marijuana that are
intended for the treatment of disease, the relief of pain, or for
any healing purpose; and WHEREAS, &quot;medicinal purposes,&quot;
for the purpose of this ordinance, would include, but not be
limited to, the treatment of AIDS, glaucoma, cancer, multiple
sclerosis, arthritis, rheumatism, severe muscle spasm, epilepsy,
asthma, as well as other serious illnesses or pain; and </p>

<p> WHEREAS, hemp preparations have been used for thousands of
years throughout the world, over 100 years in the United States
alone, for medical purposes until prohibition in 1937 by the
Federal government for political reasons; and </p>

<p> WHEREAS, Federal agencies have refused to recognize
marijuana's important role in medical therapy, continue to
maintain a prohibition against marijuana's prescriptine medical
use, and recently cancelled the nation's Federal
marijuana-as-medicine program; and </p>

<p> WHEREAS, these federal policies unnecessarily expose the
people of Summit County, including Breckenridge, to pain and
suffering and prevent physicians in Breckenridge from exercising
their professional judgment; now, therefore, be it </p>

<p> RESOLVED, that the people of Breckenridge order the Mayor to
direct the Police Chief and the District Attorney to make their
lowest priority the arrest or prosecution of those involved in
the possession or cultivation of hemp medical preparation for
medicinal purposes; and, be it </p>

<p> FURTHER RESOLVED, that the people of Breckenridge order the
Mayor to direct the District Attorney to allow a letter from a
treating physician to be used as prima facia evidence that hemp
medical preparations can alleviate the pain and suffering of that
patient's medical condition;, and be it </p>

<p> FURTHER RESOLVED, that the representative of the town of
Breckenridge lobby the Colorado Legislature for a state medical
marijuana bill. <br>
