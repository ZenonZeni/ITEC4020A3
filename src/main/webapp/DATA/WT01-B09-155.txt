<B>Project Title:  Electrosource S­fold Battery for Hybrid EVs<p>
Performing Organization:  Electrosource, Inc.</B><p>

<P>Technical POC: Steve Addington (512) 445­6606</P>

<P><B>Project Summary: </B></P><P>Development of a high voltage and high specific power battery
configuration that is necessary for a PNGV serial hybrid electric vehicle design to
deliver comparable performance to an ICE vehicle. The S-fold battery for hybrid EVs
will outstrip all competitive technologies by providing:</P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     round trip energy efficiency approaching 90% 
<LI>     short, low impedance current paths ­ excellent conductance 
<LI>     predicted 750 to 1000 watts/kg specific power ­ excellent for hybrid applications 
<LI>     will maintain 50 win/kg specific energy 
<LI>     battery design using the basic components of the proven Electrosource Horizon batteries which should permit faster development of S­fold battery 
<LI>     use of standard Horizon(D lead acid plates allowing low target cost of $150/kwh</UL> </P>

<P>By optimizing the already proven power characteristics of the Horizon battery, an
even higher specific power can be achieved without sacrificing energy density. This
is done by stacking the folded plates interleaved with separators. The capacity of the
S­fold configuration is determined by the area of the grid, five (5) ampere­hours, for
this project. Other capacities are possible with different grid sizes. This geometry
provides high voltage in a compact package.</P>

<P>By using the same raw materials in the two configurations below, early realization of
a useful battery will permit faster development of the other systems required for
marketable fuel cell and other hybrid vehicles. This graph shows how the S­Fold
battery compares with other energy storage devices:</P>
<UL>
<P>How Standard Horizon Battery and S­Fold Battery Configurations Differ: The
standard plates consist of a positive and negative pasted grid approximately 4"
square which are placed in a different geometry for the standard Horizon battery and
the S­fold battery. </P>

<P>Plates are stacked horizontally, positive grid of the plate in the first layer overlapped
by the negative grid in the second layer with an electrolyte separator placed between
the grids. </P>

<P>Folded plates are stacked in a column, interleaved with electrolyte bearing separator
material.</P>
</UL>
<P><B>S­Fold Battery for Hybrid Vehicle The Standard Horizon Design</B></P>

<P><UL>
<LI>12 volt batteries ­ 24 or 50 volt batteries 
<LI>85 or 95 amphour capacity ­ 5 amphour capacity 
<LI>6 stacks of grid pairs in series ­ 17 ­ 12 or 25 grid pairs, or 19 grid pairs per stack ­ specific power of 750 to 1000 w/kg 
<LI>specific power of 220 to 280 w/kg ­ 5.5" wide x 5.5" long x 3.5" or 7" high 
<LI>5.5" wide x 30" long x 5.5" high ­ for hybrid EVs, portable equipment, electric ­ for long range pure electric vehicles bicycles, etc.</UL></P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B> </P>

<P>Two designs will be constructed and tested as part of this project: </P>

<P><UL>
<LI>     24 volt modules will be constructed in the "S­fold" configuration and a performance benchmark for this geometry will be established. 
<LI>     50 volt modules will be constructed and tested. 
<LI>     Results will be used to define chemistry changes and plate configuration
<LI>     modifications needed to optimize the design for performance and production. </UL></P>

<P><B>Project Schedule: </B></P>

<P>This fifteen month project will provide the three­step development of the optimized
"S­fold" battery for hybrid applications. Once the battery configuration is optimized,
the next step of design and tooling for the production battery can be completed in six
to nine months.</P>
