<P>Urban air quality is one of the most widely discussed of all the environmental
issues. It has grabbed the attention of the media, public, legislators
and politicians. The European Auto/Oil Programme carried out by the European
Commission and the auto and oil industries, aimed to introduce measures
to meet stringent air quality targets across Europe with particular emphasis
on large metropolitan areas. This article concentrates on the implications
of the Auto/Oil Programme for urban air quality across Europe and is followed
by one on regional <A HREF="Ozone1.htm">ozone</A> and another on the <A HREF="Proposal.htm">emission
control</A> proposals.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="../../VISU/VOLUME52/Table1-1.gif" HSPACE=5 VSPACE=5 HEIGHT=115 WIDTH=310 ALIGN=LEFT>Seven
cities with existing emission inventories and air quality data were chosen
as representative for Europe in terms of their air quality, size, location,
and topography. These were Athens, Den Haag, K&ouml;ln, London, Lyon, Madrid
and Milano.</P>

<P>The review of air quality from 1980 onward examined a range of pollutants
including: benzene, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, particulate
matter, and total hydrocarbons. It concluded that, in general, one or more
European Union air quality limit values or WHO air quality guidelines have
been exceeded on occasion in all of the cities studied. </P>

<P>Target values were selected for modelling purposes in the Auto/Oil Programme
as agreed EU air quality objectives (AQOs) are not yet available. The basis
for these reference values was a pragmatic one. Guidance for their setting
was gained from guidelines set out by the World Health Organization (See
<A HREF="Health.htm">Health Effects of Nitrogen Oxides</A>) and by reference
to other standards or guidelines in EU Member States which are generally
more exacting than in the USA. </P>

<P>Internationally recognized and tested air quality models were used to
establish the relationships between emissions and air quality. Three pollutants-nitrogen
oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and benzene-were predicted for the base
year 1990. Three different 'state-of-the-art' atmospheric dispersion models
were used to ensure that any prediction was robust and not due to the choice
of model. For each of the seven cities, a 100 km x 100 km area including
the city and its surroundings was examined at a resolution of 2 km x 2
km. In addition, two types of meteorological conditions were examined,
one that would represent average conditions and one that would be typical
for the production of an episode of particularly poor urban air quality.</P>

<P>Air quality models considered emissions from: passenger cars (gasoline
and diesel); two-wheeled vehicles; buses; light-duty and heavy-duty commercial
vehicles; and large-, medium- and small-size stationary sources.</P>

<P>Source-receptor relationships were established and the contributions
to air pollution from each of the various source categories determined
for each 2 km x 2 km square in each city. Figure 1a shows the 1990 base
case annual mean NOx concentrations for London, and Figures 1b and 1c show
how these decrease by 2010 for two cases. If European cities are ranked
in terms of their overall air quality, approximately 80 per cent of them
have better air quality than London. The yellow areas show where the annual
mean NOx air quality target of 66 &#181;g/m3* is exceeded.</P>
