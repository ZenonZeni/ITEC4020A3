<CENTER><H3>Recent Trends in Domestic and International Terrorism   </H3></CENTER>
<p>
On February 10, 1995, a counterterrorism bill drafted by the
Clinton Administration was introduced in the Senate as S. 390 and
in the House of Representatives as H.R. 896.  The legislation
poses serious threats to constitutional rights.
<p>
Terrorism is a serious problem, and calls for a serious
response founded on a clear and accurate assessment of the facts. 
In the past, the Administration and Congress have found it highly
relevant to look at the numbers and trends of terrorist incidents
as a predicate for policy decisions.  
<p>
The Administration's proposal begins with nearly eight pages
of "findings" that omit some key facts: that terrorism in the
United States, especially terrorism of international origin, is
rare, and that terrorism abroad, including terrorism against
Americans abroad, continues to decline.
<p>
 <ul><B>1.   International Terrorism in the U.S.</B></ul>
 <p>
According to reports published by the FBI, in the past
eleven years, there have been two international terrorist
incidents in the United States.   (An international terrorist
incident is defined by the FBI as one committed by a group or
individual that is foreign-based and/or directed by countries or
groups outside the United States or whose activities transcend
national boundaries.)  One of the two incidents was the notorious
and highly destructive World Trade Center bombing in February
1993.  The other was not even directed against the U.S. and is
hard to characterize as a serious incident: in April 1992, five
opponents of the Iranian regime occupied the offices of the
Iranian Mission to the United Nations in New York City.  The five
pled guilty and were sentenced to three months in jail.  
<P>
<ul><B>2.   Domestic Terrorism in the U.S. </B></ul> 
<p>
Last year (1994), there were no terrorist incidents in the
United States, according to statistics maintained by the FBI. 
There were no preventions of terrorist incidents in the United
States.   There was one set of suspected terrorist incidents,
involving improvised explosive devices discovered at two
locations in New York.  The devices, which did not detonate, were
accompanied by notes criticizing the government of Israel as
being too liberal, signed by the Maccabee Squad and the Shield of
David.  The case remains unsolved to date.
<p>
In 1993, there were 11 domestic terrorist incidents in the
U.S.  Nine of the eleven all occurred on a single night when
animal rights activists placed small incendiary devices in four
Chicago department stores that sell furs.  (According to the FBI,
the most active domestic "terrorist" groups in recent years have
been animal rights activists and "skinheads".)
<p>
In recent years, the number of terrorist incidents in the
U.S., according to the FBI, is as follows:
<p>
<pre>
                       Actual   Prevented  Suspected 
               1994      0          0         1
               1993     12          7         2                  
               1992      4          0         0
               1991      5          4         1       
               1990      7          5         1
               1989      4          7        16
</pre>
<p>
As noted above, all but one of the incidents under "Actual" were
domestic in nature.
<p>
<ul><B>3.   International Terrorism is On the Decline; Lethality of
          Incidents Rises</B></ul>
<p>
There have been two trends in international terrorism:
incidents have been declining, while the lethality of incidents
has been increasing.   
<p>
After reaching a peak in 1987, international terrorist
incidents have been declining, according to statistics collected
and published by the U.S. Department of State.  In 1992, the 
State Department recorded a total of 364 terrorist incidents
worldwide, down from the 666 recorded in 1987.  In 1993, total
incidents increased to 427, but were it not for a series of
coordinated incidents, the level of terrorism would have fallen
in 1993 as well: the increase in 1993 over 1992 was caused by a
campaign of 150 attacks carried out by the Kurdistan Workers
Party against Turkish interests in Western Europe on two separate
days, in June and November, with about 75 attacks each day.  
<p>
In 1994, the number of terrorist incidents worldwide fell
again, to 321, according to preliminary statistics available from
the State Department.
<p> 
According to the State Department, anti-U.S. attacks fell to
88 in 1993, down from 142 in 1992.  Anti-U.S. attacks fell again
in 1994, to 66.  By comparison, in 1986, there were 204 attacks
against Americans.
<p>
According to the U.S. State Department, about 21% of world
terror is targeted at the U.S.  
<p>
In 1993, 109 people were killed and 1,393 were wounded in
terrorist incidents worldwide, the highest casualty total in five
years.  Six of those killed and nearly a thousand of those
wounded were Americans, all as a result of The World Trade Center
bombing.  Prior to that, the most deadly attack against Americans
was the downing of Pan Am 103 in 1988, in which 189 Americans
were killed.  In 1992, 2 Americans were killed and 1 was wounded
in terrorist incidents.  In 1991, there were 7 American
fatalities and 14 other casualties.  In 1990, 12 Americans were
killed and 11 injured in incidents worldwide.  
<p>
Administration officials and terrorism experts have cited
several reasons for the trend.  In December 1994, the State
Department's coordinator for counter-terrorism said that
international terrorism was declining because of the Middle East
peace process, the firm policies of the U.S and other 
governments, and the fall of the Soviet Union, which had provided
support for terrorist organizations.
<p>
In June 1994, the State Department's director for regional
counter-terrorism affairs stated, "Terrorist activity is at a
more manageable level now."  
<p>
"Clearly, there has been a very, very sharp reduction in
what we used to call state-sponsored terrorism," said Robert B.
Oakley, the retired career foreign service officer who had served
as director of the Office of Combatting Terrorism in the Reagan
administration, in a news story that appeared in September 1994.
