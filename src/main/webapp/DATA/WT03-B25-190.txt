Figure It Out: Saving Through Presetting</H1>

<P>Although everyone knows by now that performing off-
line setups for equipment is the right thing to do (surely 
most of the industrialized world has heard of its importance vis-&agrave;-vis effective cycle times and throughput), it seems that in the tooling area, one where presetting makes a tremendous amount of sense (after all, if you have a metalcutting machine and you don't have a good tool in the spindle ready to make chips, what you have on your shop floor is a rather expensive bit of sculpture), some people still need to be convinced of the usefulness of tool presetting.

<P>The people at KPT/Kaiser Precision Tooling (Elk Grove 
Village), in addition to precision boring tools, handle tool presetters. Because they know that many people are best convinced through financial arguments, they have devised a simple cost payback analysis that probably will do a better job of converting doubters of the significance of off-line setups than an entire shelf of books related to Japanese manufacturing methodologies:
<OL>
<LI>How many machining centers do you have?          
<LI>On average, how many hours per shift does each operator
spend touching off tool lengths and diameters?          
<LI>Multiply answer 1 by answer 2.          
<LI>Multiply answer 3 by the number of shifts you run.          
<LI>Enter your spindle value per hour (i.e., burden rate plus average value of production lost per hour of spindle downtime).          
<LI>Multiply answer 4 by answer 5.          
<LI>Price of presetter.          
<LI>Divide answer 7 by answer 6.
</OL>          
<P>Answer 8 is the number of days it will take for a new presetter to pay for itself.<I>GSV</I>
