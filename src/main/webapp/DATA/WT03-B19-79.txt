<I>William G. Stothers</I> has been a journalist for more than
thirty years, working for newspapers in Canada and the United
States. He graduated from the University of Western Ontario with a
degree in journalism and later obtained a master's degree in
Chinese History from the University of California at Berkeley.
He practiced newspapering at The Globe and Mail and The Toronto
Star in Canada during the 1960s and '70s.
<p>
Most recently, he spent 14 years at The San Diego Union in a number
of capacities, including Assistant City Editor, Executive Financial
Editor and Ombudsman.
<p>
In February 1992, he left The Union to become Managing Editor and
then Editor of MAINSTREAM, the authoritative national magazine for
people with disabilities. This move was a homecoming. Stothers
worked for MAINSTREAM in his free time for years, especially after
he and his wife, Cyndi Jones, the publisher, bought the magazine in
1984 from a failing non-profit organization.
<p>
Stothers, who had polio in 1950, speaks and writes widely on
disability issues and on issues of ethics in the media, as well as 
media criticism.
