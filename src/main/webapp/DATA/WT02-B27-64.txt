<H3 ALIGN=LEFT>Purpose of this Web Page</H3>
Today's classrooms are very different from those of 10 or 15 years ago. There is an increasing diversity of students in the classroom, including cultural diversity, language diversity, socioeconomic diversity, and ability diversity. The classroom teacher is faced with a group that is comprised of students with varying degrees of prior knowledge, conceptions and misconceptions about various topics, experiences, and abilities.  Each of these factors has been shown to be associated with student learning. This reality may pose problems for the classroom teacher as he or she attempts to engage in the most effective teaching possible. This web page will focus on classrooms with students of varying ability, particularly those with students who have some type of disability, and on ways to implement effective teaching in these environments.<BR>
<BR>
The questions of whether inclusion is beneficial to the child with a disability, the classmates without disabilities, the teacher(s) involved, or the families of the children involved remain controversial. One thing that is not controversial, however, is that inclusion is on the rise in the United States, as well as in other countries. (Putnam, Spiegel, & Bruninks, 1991) Although teacher preparation programs are responding to this change, the general education teachers who are practicing have, in many cases, received little basic training in how to negotiate the dynamics necessary for effective teaching in this type of setting.<BR>
<BR>
Some ways of dealing with this issue have been discovered and reported by teachers who have been faced with the situation, and have developed strategies on a trial and error basis. Some strategies have been proposed by special education teachers, who have also had to modify their method of service delivery to adapt to the new settings.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, some methods have been proposed as organized systems of teaching that have been developed by faculty members at Universities, or other "think tanks" that have been working to address these issues. This web page will draw from each of these resources, as well as from information in effective teaching in general education to develop ideas for effective teaching in inclusion settings.
