<H2>New (and grim) forecast
makes it all but official:<BR>

global warming is here</H2></CENTER>
	A draft report on climactic change made public in September by a panel of experts working under United Nations auspesis, concludes that, in fact, global warming is occurring. While some of the effects of a changing climate may be beneficial, such as more rain in agricultural regions that can use it, the overall picture is one of widespread disruption and dislocation. The draft study, described by science writer William Stevens in in the New York Times, argues that possibly dire consequences could result during the next century. <P>
	For the past five years the Intergovernmental Panel on Climactic Change, created as a result of a 1992 U.N. treaty, has been assessing data and studies to develop a long range climactic forecast.  In so doing the scientists say they are 90-to 95% convinced that the chief cause of the developing changes is the emission of greenhouse gases. While agreeing that human activity (notably burning wood and fossil fuels) is at least partially responsible, the panel said it was not yet possible to determine how much of that is man-made and how much due to natural causes. <P>
	Among some of the experts' predictions: The average sea level world-wide will rise more than 18 inches by 2100, rendering uninhabitable many heavily populated river delta regions, including entire cities, mostly in Asia. The result will be a new class of disaster victim: environmental refugees.  On the U.S. eastern seaboard, beaches that are already disappearing at the rate of 2-3 feet a year, will be gone in 25 years. Elsewhere in the US will be an increase in droughts, more heat waves, and more forest fires and floods in other regions. Worldwide, mountain glaciers will undergo a retreat the studied characterized as "striking," with most glacial-fed rivers and streams experiencing significently diminished summer flows. There will be more rain world-wide, but deserts will expand and continential heartlands will become drier. <P>
	While the forecast is disturbing, some observers regard the arrival of the five-year study itself as a hopeful sign, for the report goes a long way toward articulating an irrfutable argument that could form the basis for concerted international cooperation to forestall a global environmental emergency. <P>
