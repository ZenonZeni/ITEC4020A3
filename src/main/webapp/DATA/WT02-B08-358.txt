<blockquote> <img src=/graphics/cover_nationalrisk.jpg align=left> <font size=+2>Did you know that you can:
<p>
<ul> save money on your long distance bill each month
<p> help American Family Policy Institute continue its important work and
<p> get a free copy of reclaiming a Nation at Risk
</ul>
<p> just by making a phone call?</font>
<p> Did you know that if you are using AT&T, MCI and Sprint that you are helping to subsidize the contributions to liberals and anti-family organizations? But you can stop that today! All it takes is a phone call.
<p> It's simple. If you use LifeLine's AmeriVision long distance billing service, they will send 10% of your monthly domestic long distance bill to The American Family Policy Institute. This 10% may not seem like much, but when it is multiplied by many thousands of concerned Americans it can become a substantial amount of money.
<p> In price and quality, AmeriVision is competitive with MCI, Sprint and AT&T. There is no double billing; you will receive one bill each month from your local carrier. If you are not completely satisfied after 90 days, you can switch back to the carrier of your choice at no charge.
<p> Even if your monthly phone bill is not that high, all of us together can make a tremendous difference! You can sign up right now by calling <font size=+1 color=#00ffff>1&nbsp;(800)&nbsp;311-2783</font>.
<p> Amerivision-LifeLine was started in early 1990 to help raise funds to stop the moral decline of America. The other major carriers spend millions on advertising promoting sex and violence on T.V., which is a major cause of moral decay and increase violence among our youth throughout our nation, supporting gay rights, abortion and liberal views. LifeLine is in direct opposition to these views. We support justice, morals in our nation, pro-life, and pro-family, and take a stand against abortion, homo-sexual lifestyle, and the sex and violence on T.V. LifeLine is in direct opposition to these views.
<p> Major carriers are spending millions on T.V. advertising that only confuse the public about their discounts. Most of the time, the customer does not get discounts they are promised. All other major companies are created in the world's system which is only interested in one goal, The Almighty Dollar. LifeLine's primary goal is to support, defend and promote faith, family and freedom.
<p> The difference in LifeLine and other major carriers is that LifeLine gives $1.5 million dollars each month pro-family, pro-America, conservative organizations and causes. For every $20 that you spend on long distance, LifeLine will give $2.00 back to those organizations who are fighting to Reclaim America and defend your faith, family and freedoms. 60,000 people per month are choosing to switch to LifeLine, to save money and support the things they believe in.
<p> PLEASE REMEMBER, WHEN YOU BECOME A CUSTOMER OF LIFELINE, YOU CONTINUE TO USE THE PHONE AS YOU ALWAYS HAVE WITH ONE ADVANTAGE. NOW EVERY CALL YOU MAKE WILL HELP RESTORE THE TRADITIONAL AMERICAN CULTURE.
<p> Federal election records reveal AT&T, MCI & Sprint gave over <font size=+1 color=#ff0000>$6,000 to re-elect Ted Kennedy</font>. AT&T gave The <font size=+1 color=#ff0000>National Organization for Women $115,000</font> and AT&T and Sprint have spent thousands of dollars to help re-elect some of the most liberal congressmen.
<p> Life Line is a long distance company which supports only the pro-family agenda while saving you four to eight percent off AT&T's standard long distant charges.
<p> Not only will you save money, Life Line gives 10%% of each domestic long distant call to conservative, pro-family organizations who are fighting for your faith, family and freedoms. Imagine, quality long distance service, savings of 4-8 percent and the assurance that Life Line Long distance is not funding groups like the National Organization For Women. In fact, this year Life Line will give over 15 million dollars to conservatives who are fighting Goals 2000, outcome-based education, the Government's takeover of education and much more. Call Life Line at <font size=+1 color=#00ffff>1&nbsp;(800)&nbsp;311-2783</font>. Lifeline will switch you for free, and you can support the only the conservative agenda with each call you make. That number again is <font size=+1 color=#00ffff>1&nbsp;(800)&nbsp;311-2783</font>.
