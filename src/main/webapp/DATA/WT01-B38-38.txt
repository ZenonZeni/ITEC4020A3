<p>AGING AND ALCOHOL ABUSE </p>

<p>Alcohol abuse among older men and women is a more serious
problem than people generally realize. Until recently older
problem drinkers tended to be ignored by both health
professionals and the general public. The neglect occurred for
several reasons: our elderly population was small and few were
identified as alcoholics, chronic problem drinkers (those who
abused alcohol off and on for most of their lives) often died
before old age; and, because they are often retired or have fewer
social contacts, older people have often been able to hide
drinking problems. </p>

<p>Some families may unknowingly &quot;encourage&quot; drinking
in older family members if they have the attitude that drinking
should be tolerated because older people have only a limited time
left and therefore should be allowed to &quot;enjoy&quot;
themselves. </p>

<p>As more people learn that alcohol problems can be successfully
treated at any age, more are willing to seek help to stop
drinking. </p>

<p>Physical Effects of Alcohol </p>

<p>Alcohol slows down brain activity. It impairs mental
alertness, judgment, physical coordination, and reaction time --
increasing the risk of falls and accidents. </p>

<p>Over time, heavy drinking can cause permanent damage to the
brain and central nervous system, as well as to the liver, heart
kidneys, and stomach. </p>

<p>Alcohol can affect the body in unusual ways, making certain
medical problems difficult to diagnose. For example, the effects
of alcohol on the cardiovascular system (the heart and blood
vessels) can mask pain, which may otherwise serve as a warning
sign of heart attack. </p>

<p>Alcoholism can also produce symptoms similar to those of
dementia -- forgetfulness, reduced attention, confusion. If
incorrectly identified, such symptoms may lead to unnecessary
institutionalization. </p>

<p>Alcohol, itself a drug, mixes unfavorably with many other
drugs, including those sold by prescription and those bought
over-the-counter. In addition, use of prescription drugs may
intensify the older person's reaction to alcohol, leading to more
rapid intoxication. Alcohol can dangerously slow down performance
skills (driving, walking, etc.), impair judgment, and reduce
alertness when taken with drugs such as: </p>

<p>* &quot;Minor&quot; tranquilizers: Valium (diazepam), Librium
(chlordiazepoxide), Miltown (meprobamate), and others. </p>

<p>* &quot;Major&quot; tranquilizers: Thorazine (chlorpromazine),
Mellaril (thioridazine), and others. </p>

<p>* Barbiturates: Luminal (phenobarbital) and others. </p>

<p>* Pain killers: Darvon (propoxyphene), Demerol (meperidine),
and others. </p>

<p>* Antihistamines: both prescription and over-the-counter forms
found in cold remedies. </p>

<p>Use of alcohol can cause other drugs to be metabolized more
rapidly, producing exaggerated responses. Such drugs include:
anticonvulsants (Dilantin), anticoagulants (Coumadin), and
antidiabetes drugs (Orinase). </p>

<p>In some people, aspirin can cause bleeding in the stomach and
intestines. Alcohol also irritates the stomach and can aggravate
this bleeding. The combination of alcohol and diuretics can
reduce blood pressure in some individuals, producing dizziness. </p>

<p>Anyone who drinks -- even moderately -- should check with a
doctor or pharmacist about possible drug interactions. </p>

<p>Who Becomes a Problem Drinker? </p>

<p>In old age, problem drinkers seem to be one of two types. </p>

<p>The first are chronic abusers, those who have used alcohol
heavily throughout life. Although most chronic abusers die by
middle age, some survive into old age. Approximately two-thirds
of older alcoholics are in this group. </p>

<p>The second type begins excessive drinking late in life, often
in response to &quot;situational&quot; factors -- retirement,
lowered income, declining health, and the deaths of friends and
loved ones. In these cases, alcohol is first used for temporary
relief but later becomes a problem. </p>

<p>Detecting Drinking Problems </p>

<p>Not everyone who drinks regularly or heavily is an alcohol
abuser, but the following symptoms frequently indicate a problem:
</p>

<p>* Drinking to calm nerves, forget worries, or reduce
depression. </p>

<p>* Loss of interest in food. </p>

<p>* Gulping drinks and drinking too fast. </p>

<p>* Lying about drinking habits. </p>

<p>* Drinking alone with increasing frequency. </p>

<p>* Injuring oneself, or someone else, while intoxicated. </p>

<p>* Getting drunk often (more than three or four times in the
past year). </p>

<p>* Needing to drink increasing amounts of alcohol to get the
desired effect. </p>

<p>* Frequently acting irritable, resentful, or unreasonable
during nondrinking periods. </p>

<p>* Experiencing medical, social, or financial problems that are
caused by drinking. </p>

<p>Getting Help </p>

<p>Older problem drinkers and alcoholics have an unusually good
chance for recovery because they tend to stay with treatment
programs for the duration. </p>

<p>Getting help can begin with a family doctor or member of the
clergy; through a local health department or social services
agency; or with one of the following organizations: </p>

<p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is a voluntary fellowship of
alcoholics whose purpose is to help themselves and each other get
-- and stay -- sober. For information about their programs call
your local chapter or write to the national office at P.O. Box
459, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163. They can also
send you a free pamphlet on alcoholism and older people entitled
&quot;Time to Start Living.&quot; </p>

<p>National Clearinghouse for Alcohol Information is a Federal
information service that answers public inquiries, distributes
written materials, and conducts literature searches. For
information, write to P.O. Box 2345, Rockville, MD 20852. </p>

<p>National Council on Alcoholism distributes literature and can
refer you to treatment services in your area. Call your local
office (if listed in the telephone book) or write to the national
headquarters at 12 West 21st Street, New York, NY 10010. </p>

<p>The previous materials are a summary of information published
by: the National Institute on Aging. These materials are meant as
a general guideline. You should always consult with your own
physician prior to taking action. <br>
