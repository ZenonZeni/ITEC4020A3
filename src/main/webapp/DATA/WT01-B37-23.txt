<p><font size="4">Code of silence must come to an end</font><font
size="5"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">By Joseph McNamara</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Sunday Oakland Press - Pontiac,
Michigan October 1, 1995</strong></font><strong> </strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Citizens are having trouble distinguishing the
good guys from the bad. Retired Los Angeles Police Department
Detective Mark Fuhrman spouts venomous racism and brags to an
aspiring screenwriter about torturing, beating, and framing
suspects. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Cops across the country pull robberies while in
uniform, sell dope, steal drug-buy money, shake down criminals,
accept bribes and falsify evidence against criminal defendants.
The standard defense coming from law enforcement is that only a
relative handful of the 400,000 cops nationwide go bad. For
several reasons, the public is not reassured.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">First, the number of reported cases of bad cops
is rising. Some Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriffs get caught
robbing and extorting money from drug dealers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">In New Orleans, a uniformed cop is accused of
murdering her partner and shop owners during a robbery committed
while she was on patrol. In Washington, D.C, and in Atlanta, cops
in drug stings are arrested for stealing and taking bribes. In
Boston, two white cops frame a black man for murdering a white
woman. In New York State troopers falsify evidence that sends
people to prison. In San Francisco counterfeit evidence means
hundreds of drug convictions are likely to be overturned. Similar
evidence tampering forces the prosecution to reopen many cases in
Philadelphia.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">It's not just the rank and file, either. The
former police chief of Detroit, William Hait, is in prison for
stealing drug-buy money. In a small New England town, the chief
steals drugs from the evidence locker for his own use. A number
of southern sheriffs are convicted of being in league with drug
smugglers.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Agencies thought to be untouchable</font> <font
size="2">are suddenly reaping as many bad</font> <font size="2">headlines
as the perennially troubled</font> <font size="2">New York City
Police Depaitment. The Drug Enforcement agent who arrested
Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega on drug-trafficking charges is in
jail for stealing laundered drug money.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The FBI catches one of its agents taking drugs
from the evidence stockpile and trying to market them to regional
drug dealers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Of course, police corruption is not new. The
heritage of cops in America includes corruption, racism and abuse
for political purposes. The urban police forces started in the
1840s followed the orders of political machines like Tamany Hall.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Aficionados of Raymond Chandler's private eye,
Philip Marlowe, will recall his good luck in encountering an
occasional honest cop as he roamed Southern California in the
1930s. Ironically, it was the LAPD - whose recent problems have
amplified police departments' sins nationwide - under the
leadership of William F. Parker, that first gained its freedom
from politics to become a professional force.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">One of the fundamental problems of American
policing is the conflict between law-enforcement duties and
maintaining order in the streets. For example, the Los Angeles
Police Department is probably the most arrest-happy department in
the country. By contrast, cops in other cities send drunks home,
overlook minor vio. lations and seek to keep the streets calm
without resorting to arrest.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Also, the LAPD, as well, as other Police
forces, maintain control by aggressively policing minority
communities. Resisters are taught a lesson and, if necessary,
punished physically, they show &quot;contempt of cop&quot;.
Politicians and officials whose careers depend on tough-on-crime
rhetoric are reluctant to ask too many questions about what the
cops are doing. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Indeed, public fear of crime has</font> <font
size="2">made it increasingly difficult for the relatively small
number of police chiefs who really care to get civil-service
commissions to uphold discipline in their ranks. And the few
district attorneys willing to prosecute cops for unnecessary use
of force find it difficult to get juries to convict officers.
especially when the victim of a police hearing is a minority.
After all in a &quot;war&quot;, &quot;You cannot tie your
soldiers' hands when the 'enemy' is so dangerous.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">American policing has greatly improved since
the civil rights movement directed attention to police abuses.
But the recent outbreak of bad-cop problems has cost police
forces a lot of the credibility they had gained among minority
groups with good policing. Still, there is one silver lining in
the cloud of distrust craeted by the Fuhrman tapes and the
plethora of police scandals: more self-scrutiny.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">We should not, however, make the mistake of
getting lost in debates about such reform mechanisms as
dvilian-review boards, community policing and special
prosecutors. Rather, the essential task is to create within
police agencies an incentive to break the code of silence among
the rank and file and encourage cops to police themselves.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">A corrupt, racist or brutal cop will abstain
from misconduct only when he looks at the cop next to him and
believes that the officer will blow the wrhistle if he hits the
suspect. The police value system is what permits the kind of
behavior that gets bad headlines. Real reform is possible only
when that value system cops come to realize that must police
themselves.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">For mayors and chiefs, the first step is to
stop telling cops they are engaged in war. Next, they and
rank-and-file cops must also stop using the &quot;few bad
apples&quot; defense to obscure the fact that the code of silence
among honest cops is allowing crooked and racist cops to
flourish. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Finally, leaders should be honest and
acknowledge that good cops are now punished, instead of rewarded,
if they expose bad cops. Politicians and chiefs must recognize
that it is not negative publicity to weed out misfit; it actually
demonstrates to the public that it can trust the police to police
themselves..</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Only when the community can tell the g6od guys
from the bad will we be able to get though on crime. Then, people
will-report crime to the police, serve as witnesses and, when
they sit an a jury, believe police testimony. Justice is not
served when juries spend as much time judging the police as
determining the guilt or innocence of the person on trial.</font></p>
