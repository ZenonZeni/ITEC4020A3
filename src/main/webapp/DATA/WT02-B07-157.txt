</FONT></B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Ethanol is a grain-derived alcohol fuel
that provides significant net positive economic and environmental
benefits to the American economy and the economies of the states
where it is produced.  The existence and operation of the American
ethanol industry will provide a <U><I>net saving to the Federal
Treasury and taxpayers of almost  $4 billion</I></U> over the
next seven years. In addition to the fiscal impacts, the economic
contribution of the ethanol industry includes:
</FONT>
<P>
<ul>
<li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  Creation of almost $60 billion (1996
$) of final demand for the entire economy.
</FONT>
<li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  Generation of $12.5 billion in additional
household income over the next seven years.
</FONT>
<li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The creation of over 55,500 jobs annually
throughout the entire economy.
</FONT>
<li><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The generation of $15.6 billion of
net farm income. 
</FONT></ul>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Previous analyses of the ethanol industry
have focused on the costs to the Federal Treasury of the partial
exemption for alcohol fuels from the excise tax on motor fuels.
 Few have examined the macroeconomic contribution made by the
ethanol industry.  One such study was conducted in September 1995
by the General Accounting Office.  This  analysis concluded that
elimination of the ethanol tax exemption would result in net losses
to the U.S. Treasury over the five year period 1996-2000 because
increases in farm program payments would outweigh the $2.5 billion
increase in gasoline tax revenues.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">GAO recognized that ethanol production
would fall substantially if the excise tax exemption were removed
and that this would have a negative impact on grain prices and
farm income.  The new farm bill which was signed into law in April
1996 virtually eliminates the impact of the excise tax on government
outlays to farmers since payments are now de-linked from production.
 However, since farm income will now be increasingly tied to returns
from the marketplace, the 1996 Farm Bill actually increases the
importance of the ethanol industry since ethanol is a large and
growing element of grain demand.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">However, that is only part of the story.
 GAO failed to extend their analysis past outlays for commodity
programs to the broader implications of the ethanol industry for
aggregate output, job creation, household and business income,
and tax revenues.  This study focuses on these benefits.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">BACKGROUND</FONT></B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial"> Ethanol is an alcohol fuel which can
be  produced from almost any raw material containing sugar or
carbohydrates. Most ethanol produced in the United States is made
from grain, with corn the most prevalent feed stock.  About 60
percent of the ethanol produced from corn is made in wet milling
plants that also produce sweeteners, starches, and corn oil. 
The remaining 40 percent is produced by corn dry milling plants
that also make distillers grains (a medium protein animal feed
supplement), corn meal and other food ingredients. 
</FONT>
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="aus1.GIF" ></center>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">In 1995 nearly 1.4 billion gallons of
ethanol were produced from 553 million bushels of corn.  As shown
in Figure 1, ethanol production in the United States has increased
dramatically over the last decade and a half. This expansion occurred
largely as a result of incentives provided by federal and state
governments which were intended to reduce dependence on imported
oil and create new markets for domestically grown grain.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Under current law alcohol blends, typically
90 percent gasoline and 10 percent ethanol, are exempted from
5.4 cents of the 18.4 cents per gallon federal excise tax on gasoline.
 ETBE, an oxygenate made from ethanol is also eligible for the
 partial exemption from the federal excise tax on motor fuels,
while MTBE, which is made from methanol and usually produced from
petroleum products, is not. 
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">It is important to note that the
excise tax exemption is claimed by gasoline refiners and blenders
who use ethanol and ETBE and</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">
<I>not the producers of ethanol or farmers who grow the grain
used to make ethanol.
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The impact of the excise tax exemption
on ethanol producers is one of simple economics.  At existing
technology and current scales of production, ethanol made from
grain is more expensive to produce than is MTBE from methanol.
 Ethanol competes with gasoline and gasoline blending agents including
non-renewable oxygenates such as MTBE.  The prices of gasoline
and blending agents have been closely tied to the price of crude
oil on world markets. The largest element of variability in the
cost of producing ethanol is the price of corn and the value of
the by-product credits associated with wet and dry corn milling,
which are based on the values of the other products produced along
with ethanol. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Ethanol is competitive with the excise
tax exemption.  Without the exemption, refiners and blenders would
use alternative oxygenates that are less expensive in part because
of domestic and foreign subsidies, and the market for ethanol
would collapse.   In the absence of the exemption, blenders and
some refiners will shift to lower-cost MTBE as their oxygenate
of choice.  As a result, total corn demand over the next seven
years period would be reduced by nearly 3.4 billion bushels.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The solid line in Figure 2 depicts the
projected path of ethanol demand based on current market conditions
and environmental regulations. This baseline suggests very modest
growth in ethanol demand through 2002.  The dotted line depicts
the impact elimination of the excise tax exemption is expected
to have on ethanol production. Without a market ethanol producers
indicate that they would be forced to sharply curtail operations
and abandon new investment.  The impact on the industry would
be felt within months of a repeal decision, and the impact on
the economy would follow directly.
</FONT>
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="aus2.GIF"></center>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">According to the Renewable Fuels Association,
the national trade association representing the ethanol industry,
ethanol will be produced in over 50 plants in 17 states in 1996.
 Over 90 percent of ethanol production capacity is concentrated
in the major Mid-western corn producing states of Illinois, Iowa,
Nebraska, Minnesota., Indiana, and Kansas.  Despite the geographic
concentration of the industry, ethanol is produced in all regions
of the country.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The partial exemption from the excise
tax on motor fuels was originally enacted to achieve several objectives.
The first of these was to enhance national security by reducing
dependence on imported oil through replacement with a domestically
produced alternative. The United States has an  insatiable appetite
for energy, particularly energy derived from oil and other petrochemicals.
While success in conservation and improved efficiency has slowed
growth in energy use over the past several decades, dependence
on imported  oil has increased significantly.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Ethanol is used as an oxygenate and
is virtually equivalent on a one-to-one basis with MTBE which
is produced from petrochemical feedstocks.  If domestically produced
ethanol was not available, an additional 1.6 billion gallons of
MTBE would be required to meet existing environmental requirements.
 Virtually all of this additional MTBE would have to be imported.
 This would reduce the U.S. merchandise trade balance by $1.3
billion annually.  
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">A second objective of the excise tax
exemption was to create an additional market for agricultural
commodities that would provide market-based support for prices
and lessen the dependence of farmers on government subsidies.
 The  ethanol industry has been an unqualified success in creating
an important domestic market for grain.  Ethanol currently accounts
for 6.2 percent of total corn utilization and is the third largest
individual use of corn. Ethanol accounts for about 14 cents of
the value of every bushel of corn marketed by American farmers.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The 553 million bushels of corn purchased
to manufacture ethanol last year directly provided $1.3 billion
of cash receipts for U.S. corn growers.  This amounted to six
percent  of the total gross income for corn growers.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Ethanol also provides significant net
positive environmental benefits.  Ethanol adds oxygen to gasoline
which reduces exhaust emissions of ozone-forming VOC's and carbon
monoxide.  It is widely used in reformulated gasolines currently
being sold in ozone non-attainment areas across the country. 
Because ethanol adds octane to gasoline, it also reduces the use
of other highly toxic petroleum-derived octane enhancers such
as benzene, toluene, and xylene.  And because it is produced from
agricultural feedstocks, ethanol is the only transportation motor
fuel which helps to reduce global warming.  Ethanol's environmental
promise was summarized by EPA Administrator Carol Browner at a
recent Senate hearing, &quot;expanding the use of renewable fuels
can help clean up our air and lower emissions of harmful greenhouse
gasses.&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The ethanol industry has successfully
accomplished each of these objectives.  
</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">ANALYSIS</FONT></B>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The ethanol industry makes a significant
contribution to the overall U.S. economy and the  economies of
the states where production is concentrated.  This contribution
can be measured in terms of increased final demand for goods and
services from other industries; jobs provided by the ethanol industry
as well as other industries that supply ethanol producers; and
additional household income for all Americans.  Finally, the federal
government and states receive tax revenue from personal, business, and corporate
income taxes paid on wages and additional income generated as
a result of the operation of the ethanol industry. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Estimation of the benefits of the ethanol
industry to the American economy involved a multi-stage process.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The first steps involved collecting
information about current ethanol production by state and outlining
the growth in ethanol demand over the next seven years. Much of
this information was provided by the ethanol industry through
the Renewable Fuels Association. Projected growth in ethanol demand
is described in Figure 2 above and summarized in Appendix Table
1. 
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The value of output of the ethanol
industry in constant 1996 dollars was estimated by multiplying
annual production by the 1996 average  price of ethanol estimated
at $1.32 per gallon.  This provided annual estimates of the value
of final demand delivered by the food processing sector.  The
food processing sector contains corn milling firms that produce
ethanol.  These estimates are summarized in Appendix Table 2.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  Since the major input for the ethanol
industry is grain, we estimated the contribution of the corn used
for ethanol production on agricultural output, prices, and farm
income.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">This was accomplished by performing
a simulation of an econometric model of the agricultural sector.
 The baseline agricultural forecast incorporates the major provisions
of the 1996 Farm Bill and a continuation of the excise tax exemption
for ethanol. The simulation to determine the &quot;value added&quot;
by ethanol was triggered by reducing the amount of corn used for
ethanol production from an average of 645 million bushels  to
162 million bushels annually.  This reduction is consistent with
the impact on ethanol production the industry anticipates in the
absence of the incentives provided by the excise tax exemption.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  The annual economic contribution of
the ethanol industry was estimated by applying output, earnings,
and employment multipliers to the value of industry output, wages,
and industry employment of ethanol producers for each producing
state and the United States as a whole.  The state and national
level multipliers used in this analysis were taken from the Regional
Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II) of the U.S. Department
of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.</FONT>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The ethanol industry makes a significant
contribution to the American economy.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol will add almost $51 billion
(1996$) of final demand to the entire American economy.</B>  The
goods and services purchased by ethanol producers represent purchases
of final demand of other industries.  These include purchases
of corn and other grain from farmers (agriculture), natural gas,
electricity, water and sewer, and telephone (utilities), and accounting
and legal services (business services).  Each of these supplier
industries  in turn purchases inputs from other industries.  If
ethanol producers were no longer in business  these supplier firms
would have to find alternative markets for their output.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">    <B>Farm income for crop producers
will be $2.2 billion, or nearly 3 percent, higher each year because
of ethanol production.</B><BR>
Increased demand for grain grown by
American farmers provides market support for prices and incomes.
 If the market for ethanol did not exist, corn stocks would rise,
prices would fall, profitability would decline and farmers would
be encouraged to plant other crops.  Since payments to farmers
under the 1996 farm bill are fixed and cannot vary with stocks
and prices, price declines associated with a collapse of demand
will directly affect cash farm income.  When all crop shifts caused
by changes in relative crop profitability are accounted for, net
income for American grain farmers is $15.6 billion higher over
the next seven years than would be the case without an ethanol
incentive.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol supports 55,500 jobs each
year: </B><br>
Ethanol production directly accounts for over 5,800
jobs in the food processing industry in 17 states.  As demand
for ethanol grows, the number of people directly employed by the
industry will also increase.  Additionally, the spending of ethanol
manufacturers on goods and services, which represents the creation
of final demand, will indirectly support an average of 48,900
jobs annually throughout  all other industries in the entire economy.
 These jobs would be lost if ethanol production ceased due to
loss of the excise tax exemption.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol generates income for all
Americans as the wages paid to the workers who produce ethanol
are spent and re-spent throughout the entire economy. </B> <br>
The ethanol industry directly pays $277 million in wages to employees.
These employees and their families spend this income thereby creating
demand.  The indirect impact adds another $1.8 billion to household
income annually.  Over the seven-year period 1996-2002, ethanol
production will increase total household income by $12.5 billion.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol contributes over $2 billion
annually to the U.S. trade balance</B>. <br>
By displacing imported MTBE ethanol reduces the U.S. merchandise trade deficit by about
$1.3 billion annually.  But the trade implications of ethanol
don't stop with MTBE.  The majority of the by-products of ethanol
production -- corn gluten feed and gluten meal -- are exported.
 This further reduces the trade deficit by earning over $800 million
annually. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  <B>Ethanol generates $555 million
of net tax revenue for the Federal Treasury annually through personal
and business income tax receipts.</B>  <br>
The excise tax exemption for alcohol fuels represents a cost to 
the U.S. Treasury through foregone
revenue. The Joint Tax Committee estimated that the exemption
would cost $2.5 billion in revenues over the five-year 1996-2000
period. Extrapolation through 2002 based on ethanol production
estimates discussed earlier suggests that the cost of the exemption
over the seven-year period would total $3.5 billion. However,
this &quot;cost&quot; must be offset by the additional revenues
that will be provided by taxes on household and farm income that
are generated and supported by the ethanol industry. The ethanol
industry will generate $7.4 billion in additional income taxes
over the next seven years, nearly $3.9 billion more than the estimated
cost of the partial excise tax exemption in forgone tax revenues.While
these economic impacts are concentrated in the major ethanol producing
states, nearly all states benefit from the existence of the industry.
 This reflects the fact that goods and services freely flow across
state borders and no individual state is self sufficient in everything
needed for manufacturing.  For example, while an Iowa ethanol
producer may purchase corn from an Iowa corn farmer, the machinery
he uses to process the corn may have been made in Illinois or
Pennsylvania; his advertising and public relations may be provided
by a firm in Chicago or New York; and his business insurance underwritten
by a New Jersey or Connecticut insurer.</FONT>
<P>
<HR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Implications of the 1996 Farm Bill for 
ethanol</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The 1996 Farm Bill provides the first
major redesign of federal agricultural support programs since
they were developed in the 1930s.  Chief among these changes is
formally breaking the link between eligibility for farm program
payments and production, and removal of ARP authority.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Prior to 1996 government payments to
farmers were determined by a confluence of legislatively-set target
prices and market prices. In order to qualify for program payments
eligibility farmers had to agree to set aside, or not plant, a
certain percentage of their acreage base annually and comply with
conservation provisions.  Farmers were discouraged from planting
non-program crops such as soybeans on their acreage bases since
they would lose program eligibility on that land.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The Secretary of Agriculture used the
Acreage Reduction Program (ARP), or set-aside, provisions of the
farm bill to manage supply and government budget exposure. The
basic parameters for ARPs for the major program crops were established
in the five-year farm bills.  The legislation gave the Secretary
discretion to establish annual set-asides subject to the ratio
of ending stocks to total demand.  A high ratio signaled a surplus
condition which generally depressed market prices.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Since government payments were determined
by a deficiency payment rate which was the difference between
the legislated target price and the higher of the market price
or the loan rate, large supplies and low prices generally resulted
in increased government payments.  Under the new farm bill, deficiency
payments are replaced by declining fixed payments over a seven-year
contract period.  Farmers  know in advance how much they can expect
from government payments each year through 2002.  They also know
that these payments will be unchanged by market conditions.  
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The 1996 Farm Bill removes the ARP as
a supply management tool and gives farmers virtually complete
flexibility to plant whatever crops they choose based on signals
from the marketplace.  Therefore, a shock to demand such as a
sharp decline in ethanol production, would increase stocks and
reduce prices and, therefore, profitability.  Under the new farm
bill farmers are free to shift as much of their corn acreage as
they desire to whatever crop they think will be more profitable
during the next season. If corn profitability declines, growers
would shift acreage to other crops such as soybeans, wheat, and
cotton (in the South).  Production of these crops would increase,
their prices would fall, and the planting decision process would
be reevaluated in the following spring.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Since annual government payments to
farmers are fixed, net income will be more fully exposed to a
decline in market prices than has been the case for the past fifty
years. This means a shock to demand that reduces prices will be
directly absorbed by farmers through reduced farm income. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">The ethanol industry also benefits farmers
through ownership of manufacturing plants.  According to the Renewable
Fuels Association 8 of the 50 operating ethanol plants in 1996
are farmer-owned cooperatives.  These plants account for over
200 million gallons, or about 20 percent, of ethanol production. 
Removal of the excise tax exemption would force these plants to
close and would remove another important source of income for
the farmer-owners. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">Our analysis  suggests that ethanol
makes the following contribution to the agricultural economy:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial">  
<ul>
<li>Corn plantings would average 81.8
million acres over the 1996-2002 period, 3.4 million acres higher
than would be the case without ethanol. <p>  
<li>Ending stocks of corn
stocks would total one billion bushels by August 31, 2002 providing
an average stocks to use ratio (a measure of the adequacy of supplies
to meet demand) of 11 percent over the seven-year period.  In
the absence of ethanol demand stocks would be 20 percent higher.<p>
<li>The demand for corn represented by the ethanol industry will
provide an average farm level price for corn of $2.65 over the
1996-2002 period.  This is 4.6 percent higher than would be the
case without the ethanol industry.
