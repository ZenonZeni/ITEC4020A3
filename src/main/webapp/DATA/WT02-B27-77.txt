<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Cooperative Learning Principles:<BR>
Essential Elements</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>Developed by <A HREF="../Students#LR">Luz Rodriguez</A></FONT><BR>
<HR> 
Understanding the essential elements allows teachers to think <A HREF="../Metacog/Meta.home">metacognitively</A> about cooperative learning and create any number of strategies and lessons. This will allow them to tailor cooperative learning to their unique instructional needs, circumstances, curricula, subject areas, and students.<BR>
<BR>
Sevearl different elements of cooperative learning have been identified in the literature (<A HREF="CoopRef#Holubec">Holubec, 1992</A>; <A HREF="CoopRef#John86">Johnson & Johnson, 1986</A>; <A HREF="CoopRef#Jules">Jules, 1992</A>):<BR>

<LI> <B>Positive Interdependence:</B> The students must believe that they sink or swim together. The success of the group depends on the success of each group. In order to strengthen positive interdependence, joint rewards, divided resources, and complementary roles may also be used.  member; thus, group members work together to promote individual and group success.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <B>Accountability:</B> All individuals are accountable for their actions as they relate to the rest of the group and group's success. The performance of each individual student is assessed and the results given back to the group and the individual. It is important that the group knows who needs more assistance, support, and encouragement in completing the assignment.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <B>Collaborative and Social Skills:</B> collaborative decision-making, trust-building, communication, leadership, conflict-management, etc., as well as social skills (such as accepting and giving criticism and praise, listening, turn-taking, sharing, compromising, being responsible for materials, tasks, and roles, etc.) are important elements in cooperative learning because they represent the ways in which individuals interact and work collectively. These should be taught prior to placing students in cooperative groupings.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <B>Group processing:</B> it is conducted after the cooperative activity occurs. Students then critically examine their group behavior by using an evaluation sheet and discussing their interactions (what effective or ineffective skills were used). Teachers need to ensure that members of each cooperative learning group discuss how well they are achieving their goals and maintaining effective working relationships. Groups need to describe what member actions are helpful or unhelpful and make decisions about what behaviors to continue or change.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <B>Face-to-Face Promotive Interaction:</B> Teacher must ensure that students interact to help each other accomplish the task and promote each other's success. This in turn, results in both higher achievement and in getting to know each other on a personal as well as a professional level.<BR>
