				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>The Brasília mine is a large tonnage, open pit operation, situated approximately 200 kilometres southeast of Brazil's capital city, beside the town of Paracatu in the state of Minas Gerais. In 1995, the mine produced 162,500 ounces of gold, compared to 168,800 ounces in 1994. Cash costs averaged $235 per ounce in 1995, compared to $196 per ounce in 1994. The increase in cash cost year over year was primarily due to the appreciation of the Brazilian currency.</B>

			<P><IMG SRC="/images/Brasilia2.jpg" ALT="Brasília Picture" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141>TVX Gold increased its equity interest in the Brasília mine by 10% to 33% effective January 25, 1995. The other partners are a Brazilian subsidiary of Rio Tinto-Zinc plc (51%) which is the operator and a subsidiary of Montana Power Corporation (16%). The mine property, which has been in commercial production since 1988, covers 57,000 hectares.
<P>Proven and probable reserves at Brasília contained 3.4 million ounces of gold at the end of 1995. This is sufficient to maintain production at planned rates for a further 14 years.
<P>The Brasília gold deposit occurs within the Paracatu sandstone-shale formation, a unit of Proterozoic age in the central Brazilian Shield. Native gold, alloyed with minor amounts of silver, tends to occur around quartz boudins, especially where these are marked by layers of iron carbonates and pyrrhotite. These boudins, sometimes up to 0.5 metres long, occur within a weathered, well laminated, dark grey, 40 metre-thick phyllite layer which contains thin lenses of carbonate, lenses or single crystals of sulphides, a thin but persistent bank of quartzite and other thinner and less consistent sandstone horizons. Mineralization also continues for approximately 30 metres below the main phyllite, in a partially weathered phyllite with visible sulphide and a high graphitic content. Grades in this lower layer, which is not included in the current mining plan, are similar to the remainder of the orebody.
<P>The ore at Brasília is sufficiently soft that it requires no drilling or stripping and only minimal blasting. Bulldozers loosen and heap the ore for front-end loaders to lift into dump trucks which deliver it to the mill. In the plant, the ore is crushed and ground and introduced into a flotation circuit. After the coarse gold is recovered by gravimetric methods, the remainder is recovered by cyanidation and carbon-in-leach and carbon-in-pulp processes. An ore stockpile is built up during the dry season to provide millfeed in the wet season when pit mining is slowed by heavy rains.
<P>Ongoing improvements to the mill have allowed throughput to exceed 13.4 million tonnes annually over the last two years. A further expansion of capacity to 18 million tonnes annually is also planned, at a capital cost of approximately $65 million. This will include construction of a $45 million hydrometallurgical plant starting in mid-1996. The goal of the expansion is to increase annual production to 260,000 ounces of gold in 1998, with production thereafter planned to average 210,000 ounces of gold per year to the year 2005.
<P>The introduction of 85-tonne trucks and ancillary equipment as part of the expansion, at a capital cost of approximately $14 million, is expected to improve production efficiencies early in 1996. The new equipment replaces the previous 20-tonne mining fleet operated by a contractor.
<P>Production from Brasília in 1996 is planned at approximately 158,000 ounces of gold.
