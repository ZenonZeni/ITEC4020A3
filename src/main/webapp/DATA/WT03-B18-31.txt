<p>The complexity of the problems to be faced in subsea robotics
and the level of investment involved in developing and testing
new tools indicate that priority should be given to studies which
have prospects for practical application. IAN's vehicles have
played a significant role in the following applied missions: </p>

<ul>
    <li><h4>The 1997/98 Expedition to Antarctica</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4><a href="#ANTARCTICA">The 1993/94 Expedition to
        Antarctica</a> </h4>
    </li>

        Expedition to Antarctica, funded under the National Program
        for Research in Antarctica, included the first underwater
        robotics campaign to be carried out in that region. This
        was conducted by IAN's Robotics Department using the
        underwater vehicle ROBY2, which was purposely modified to

        an autonomous subsea vehicle which is being developed in
        collaboration with ENEA; to collect oceanographic and

        benthos. <p><a href="vehicle.htm#ROBY2">ROBY2</a>
        performed well on all missions, undertaking 18 dives for
        a total of over 20 hours of navigation at a depth of up
        to 150 metres. No mechanical faults were recorded and no
        temperature-related problems were experienced in the
        batteries. The video recording system produced
        high-quality images of the environment. The vehicle's
        contribution to the success of the various scientific
        missions has demonstrated the importance of intelligent
        underwater vehicles in support of research in marine
        sciences.</p>

<p>At the same time, vehicle testing in extreme conditions has
yielded significant information, and potential improvements have
been identified which will make the vehicle more responsive to
the actual needs of scientists. </p>

of Deep-sea Red Coral</font></a></h3>

<p><font size="3">In 1994 IAN 's Robotics Department and Genoa
University's Institute of Zoology carried out a joint study of
red coral in the Ligurian Sea. Funded by the Ministry of
Agriculture, the study was aimed at monitoring the slow growth of
the local coral colonies, which in the past two decades were
severely overexploited.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">IAN's underwater vehicle, ROBY2, performed 4
dives in two days off Portofino Promontory to survey the deep-sea colonies.
On each dive, the vehicle spent about two hours at a depth of up
to 120 metres monitoring the seabed. A support boat followed the
vehicle during the mission.</font></p>
