<H1><CENTER>About BioCentury(TM)</H1></CENTER><P>

BioCentury, the Bernstein Report on BioBusiness, is the leading U.S. publication focused on bioscience industry development, corporate performance and valuations. Its goal is to be the most thoughtful and complete U.S. publication serving the biotechnology industry today.<P>

BioCentury is delivered via facsimile or electronic mail each weekend (U.S. time). It covers current trends in management issues, company formation, clinical activities, partnering and financial strategies and public policy. When events demand more immediate coverage, BioCentury Extra editions are sent via fax or email during the week.<P>

Editor-in-Chief Karen Bernstein, Ph.D., is among the most respected and independent bioscience analysts in the U.S. Through her personal connections to hundreds of biotechnology executives, financiers, investors and consultants, Dr. Bernstein's analysis reflects the current thinking of the most influential leaders in the industry.<P>

BioCentury's analytical approach is complemented by a complete report of each week's news, organized into sections devoted to alliances and other business announcements, clinical trial reports, and stock market information.<P>

These efforts are supported by a prominent panel of Editorial Advisors, representing the corporate sector and investment community.<P>

BioCentury supplements its publishing activity by sponsoring conferences on Wall Street that have been well-attended by institutional investors and bioscience companies from North America and Europe. The conferences, like the journal, provide the industry with an independent forum for discussion, analysis and debate.<P>

A growing audience of senior company managers and institutional investors in North America, joined by increasing numbers of readers in Europe, consider BioCentury to be a most useful tool for industry surveillance in the U.S. We hope that our information proves to be as valuable to our Japanese audience.<P>
