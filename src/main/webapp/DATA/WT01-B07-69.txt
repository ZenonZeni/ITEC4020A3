Air quality control in ventilation and air-cleaning systems is provided  by ventilation itself, air purification and reduction of atmospheric  emissions. Ventilation in industrial premised may provide for air re-circulation  use of laminar airflows, design of ventilation modules, zonal planning  of workrooms, separate local systems of heating and ventilation, control  automatization and increasing ventilation and air purification expenses  in capital investments. Air purification systems being a part of ventilation systems should be  based on the following principles: contaminant volume and amount  decrease design and use of air purification systems correlating with the  source of contaminant emissions, minimizing systems resistance. Environmental safety in ventilation and air purification system  accidents, which includes preventative measures, measures for  elimination of hazardous effects, safety standard is a matter of the  greatest concern at the present time. Air quality control at present time should provide effective and  economical ventilation which meets the requirements on environmental  safety.

Using data from a large number of teacher questionnaires distributed to  public elementary schools in Kawasaki, Japan, we determined factors  having the strongest influence on their sensory evaluations of thermal  and cross-ventilation condition in natural-ventilated  temperature-climate classrooms. These influential factors were derived  from various factors regarding thermal-related environmental control  used by teachers and classroom architectural planning factors. Then,  using data from student questionnaires, we determined seating-dependent  distributions of similar sensory evaluation for groups of classes with  respective category of influential factors. AS the result, windows and  door were fully opened except being closed for the safety and noise  control reasons. The class directional orientation and the window types  related to architectural openings had the strongest influence on sensory  evaluations. The classrooms facing southward and having window types  tend to be fully opened provided the most comfortable thermal  environment.

The air exchange rate (or air changes per hour:ACH) was measured under 4  different conditions in 3 stationary cars. The ACH ranged between 1.0  and 3.0-h1 with windows closed and no mechanical ventilation, between  1.8 and 3.7-h1 with windows closed and fan set on recirculation, between  13.3 and 26.1-h1 with windows open and no mechanical ventilation, and  between 36.2 and 47.5-h1 with windows closed with the fan set on fresh  air. ACH with windows closed and no ventilation was higher for the  older car than for the newer cars. With the windows closed and the fan  turned off, ACH was not influenced by wind speed. ACH in parked cars is  relevant to understanding exposures to pollutants from internal sources  was estimated using the EPA model for simulated "stop-and-go" urban  driving cycles, and it was found that the pollutants build up rapidly  and are diluted slowly inside parked cars.

Energy conservation is not always an inconsistent idea with the indoor  air quality HVAC designers should keep in mind that the harmony of these  two concepts depend on their design philosophy as well as on their  practical evaluation measures. The thermal zoning HVAC should be   necessarily followed by the ventilation zoning. Several advanced  techniques, such as the task-and-ambient system, transient  characteristics of the room environment and human body and dynamic  simulation, should be applied to obtain a better individual thermal  satisfaction with even better indoor air quality.

Formaldehyde concentrations and air exchange rates were measured in 53  rooms of 27 prefabricated houses. The concentrations of formaldehyde  were determined with a photometric method, whereas ventilation rates  were measured with a tracer-gas technique. In 40% of the cases indoor  formaldehyde concentrations exceeded the guideline value of 0.12 mg/m  cube (median 0.111 mg/m cubed)> Critical formaldehyde concentrations  were found in older prefabricated houses (erected before 1985) with  chipboard walls, with the boards facing the interior of the rooms and in  rooms with old furniture. Material tests identified chipboard as the  major emission source of formaldehyde in these buildings. In most  objects measured air exchange rates (median=0.20h -1) indicated very  poor ventilation, which was another reason for high concentrations of  formaldehyde.

A trial was set up to determine the effectiveness of mechanical  ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) in reducing humidity and the  effect this has on house dust mite populations in homes occupied by  asthmatic patients. The trial included monitoring of a range of factors  that might change with the introduction of MVHR and we have an effect on  clinical measures of asthma. One such factor was the level of NO2,  which was measured in the kitchen, bedroom, living room and outside at  40 homes, before and after MVHR was installed in 20 of these homes. The  introduction of MVHR had no significant effect on NO(2) in any room or  season even when homes with and without gas cooking were treated  separately.

Several tests of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in both adult's and  children's bedrooms have shown high levels in a fraction of the houses.  This indicates a very low effective ventilation rate per person and the  possibility that the concentration of other contaminants in the air in  those rooms will also be high, at reasonable source strengths of the  pollutants. Since bedrooms are designed for sleep, during which the  resting body makes repairs to many systems, this does not bode will for  the general health of those sleeping in such rooms. More research into  the concentration of other contaminants in high CO2 houses is warranted.  At the levels of CO2 found in some rooms, there may even be some direct  effects of CO2, a possibility being studied by Hydro Quebec and Health  Canada.

Traditionally we used to design air conditioning systems to provide  constant comfort air conditions (temperature, humidity and velocity) in  an occupied zone. Is that really what we, inhabitants of air  conditioned spaces are looking for? Observations of hygienists show  that a man has a better productivity, working at lower surrounding room  temperature, until he feels discomfort of being chilled or we would  prefer higher indoor temperature before lunch than after it. Should we  consider these observations as a message that we would rather provide  variable than steady indoor climate? We succeeded in separating a man  from outdoor conditions, placing him into the shelters of modern  buildings. There is no doubt that we would like to be isolated from   outdoor pollutants, traffic noise and other unpleasant irritants, but  why to be separated from a fresh breeze of air with velocity sometimes  exceeding the comfort level of say 0.15 m/s, or warmth of a swift  sunlight. The subject of this paper is not to report an achievement but  rather to initiate a dispute on the current approach in consideration of  comfort conditions for indoor climate and discuss a new trend in air  conditioning system design. DYNAMIC or INTELLIGENT ventilations is a system, where temperature,  velocity, humidity of air, its ion and possibly odor composition,  lighting in the room and probably sound effects are controlled by a  program according to the inhabitants wishes or hygienists  recommendations, the main features and basic components of the system  are presented. It may be a system of the nearest future and we,  engineers, do not see any technical obstacles to put it into practice.

A new bullet train car with an effective ventilation system has been  constructed as a result of co-operation between Japan Tobacco In. and  East Japan Railway Company. The purpose of this system is to provide  satisfactory and good quality air both to smokers and non-smokers on  board. The principal aim of the system is to control the air stream in  the carriage so as to prevent the tobacco smoke in the smoking section  from moving into the non-smoking section. Moreover, an electrostatic  precipitator and a deodorant filter were installed. The efficiency of  this system was examined using this new train car.

The present study aims to assess the between and within workstations  variability of the indoor air conditions in a sealed building with  mechanical ventilation. The building under study had 9 constant air  HVAC systems with 30 units of distribution and an outdoor air intake of  a least 15 L/S/P for each system. CO2, temperature, humidity, and air  velocity were measured 4 times/day in 120 workstations and were repeated  during 3 days in 23 workstations. Total VOC, formaldehyde and total  airborne particulates were measured in 14 workstations. Variability  between workstations during work hours was for CO2: 571 ppm +- 69, for  temperature: 23.2 degrees C +- 0.5, for humidity: 30% +_ 4, and for air  velocity: .04m/sec. +- .03 (neck) and .03 m/sec. +_ .03 (ankles).  Variability within workstations over 3 days was also low despite some  outdoor variations. Total VOC were less than 200g/m cube, formaldehyde  less than 2m/g cube and total airborne particulates less than 25g/m  cube except for 3 workstations and outside. Properly designed building  with mechanical ventilation and air conditioning can be effective in  maintaining relatively stable indoor air conditions between and within  workstations.

In the ship repair industry, enormous amounts of repair work is done in  very large crude carriers (VLCC), such as in the cargo and ballast  tanks. During the repair process, large quantities of smoke, fumes and  heat are generated in these confined spaces. Due to the great depth and  size of the tanks and limited number of openings on the deck, it is very  difficult to extract these toxic gases. A new ventilation system based on the "all-directional, global  ventilation using the push-pull and displacement method" was designed.  The design concept is based on transferring fresh air to the bottom of  the compartments and blowing it out uniformly from an air distributor in  a "vector flow". Suction tubes installed at the top of the compartment  would bring out heat and dust. It was shown by computer simulation and  experimentation that the air flow pattern was reasonable and efficient.  The new ventilation system can be used not only in the repair processes  of VLCC but also in similar enclosed spaces such as big workshops and  warehouses.

A new air flow management system has been developed, which is based on a  mathematical model of the ductwork. The model is given as input data in  the form of a table. The intelligent control system checks the ductwork  and makes an automatic balancing procedure to determine the pressure  drops of different ductwork components and branches. Once the control  system knows the geometry of the ductwork, it can control the system  according to described procedures.

External air quality has a direct effect on the quality of indoor air in  rooms of natural ventilation whereas in air-conditioned rooms it defines  the ventilation system ( e.g. filter type) to be selected. We have  performed on-spot measurements to study the dust pollution of air in the  inner city of Budapest of moderate traffic and in walking areas of no  motor vehicle traffic. Based on the measurement results we have  evaluated air quality and efficiency of the filtering stages to be  applied by climate centres in view of the annual filter replacement  costs.

The strategy most frequently used by building engineers to maintain an  acceptable indoor air quality in office buildings and solve indoor air  quality related complaints in ventilation. It is generally assumed that  the indoor air quality requirements would be automatically met if  adequate ventilation were provided. Ventilation is particularly effective under two situations: to  re-establish the indoor air quality level after a scheduled shut down of  the HVAC system and to speed up the removal of the contaminants  generated in areas where renovations are taking place. In North  America, it is a common practice to shut down the HVAC system in the  evenings of week days and during weekends to save energy. It is also  common to have renovations take place in part of an occupied building.  Under either situation, special measures have to be used to remove the  contaminant build-up as a direct result of such activities. To use this strategy effectively and in an energy efficient manner, it  is not adequate to simply increase the ventilation rate. The building  engineers have to know when, how much and how long the ventilation rate  would need to be increased. Discussions with building engineers suggest  that they do not have such information. This paper provides some  practical guidelines for the building engineers to effectively operate  the HVAC system after a scheduled shut-down or during a renovation  period to avoid indoor air quality problems. These guidelines have been  developed from the results of computer simulations of the contaminant  movement in buildings and from experience in managing buildings.

The impact of outdoor air change rates on the indoor air pollutant  levels was evaluated in office buildings located in metropolitan areas  of Seoul, Korea. Five buildings were selected for measurements. The  concentration levels of the indoor air pollutants were monitored at  different outdoor air change rates and the odor and discomfort ratings  were surveyed with questionnaire by the occupants. The correlation  between ventilation rate and indoor air pollutant levels were evaluated  in various operating conditions of HVAC system. The results of this study could indicate that the air change rates and  the carbon dioxide concentrations were statically significant in office  buildings, and the proper outdoor air change rates and the operational  strategy of ventilation systems should be considered differently with  symptoms of occupants in office building.

The probable fire environment in an enclosed car park to be constructed  was studied by using a fire zone model. Results are applied to assess  the performance of the installed fir protection system. Alternate  designs for smoke control and the thermal sensitivity of the sprinkler  heads were evaluated. Performance of the ventilation system in this car  park was assessed by studying the thermal environment at the occupied  zone using Computational Fluid Dynamics. The air speed predicted were  used to calculate the mean age of the air and the percentage of  dissatisfied. From the investigation, designs on the fire protection  and ventilation systems are recommended for providing a healthy and safe  environment in this car park.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether the decrease  in the prevalence of symptoms observed six months after exposure to a  building with an improved ventilation system was maintained three years  later. More than 1300 office workers completed a self-administered  questionnaire in 1991, before moving, in 1992, six months after moving,  and in 1995. The prevalence of most symptoms decreased by 40 to 50% in  1992 compared to 1991 and was maintained in 1995 after controlling for  personal, psychosocial, and work-related factors.

Knowledge of tobacco smoke exposures in indoor environment plays an  important role. We are looking for a possibility to estimate and  compare objective smoking quantities by analysis of sedimented indoor  particles by nicotine as a target compound. The results show a good  conformity with the real tobacco consume in the examined flats.  Limitations of this method are in the possible use of nicotine as  pesticide and in the possible residues from earlier tobacco consume. A  sufficient classification can be made, if none, less or frequently  tobacco will be smoked inside the house. The average concentration of  nicotine in non-smoker houses is 3 ug/g indoor dust (+- 2 ug/g). One  cigarette smoked daily increases the concentration by 5 ug/g (+- 2ug/g).

Kitchen-area 22-hour gravimetric PM2.5 and diffusion staintube CO  concentrations were measured in homes with open-fire and improved wood  cookstoves in two studies, one in three test houses an one in 15  open-fire and 25 improved-stove houses. CO personal samples were also  taken for mother and child. Correlations between kitchen-area and CO  and PM2.5 levels were high (r2+0.89-0.94), as were those between the  personal samples for mother and child (r2+0.95-0.99). In general, the  correlations were lower for less-polluted conditions. The C)/PM2.5  ratio averaged 12.3-144.4 and 13.1-16.2 for open fires and improved  stoves. These results generally support the use of CO staintubes as a  proxy for PM2.5

Field measurement has been conducted to study the PM-10 level at several office entrance areas inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University which  is located close to automobile pollution sources. One building was  selected for detailed investigation. Both indoor and outdoor dust  levels were measured at the entrance. A simple expression has been used  to indicate the influence of human movement and wind speed on the indoor  and outdoor PM-10 ratio. It has been found that high wind speed  corresponds to almost identical indoor and outdoor dust concentrations.  The higher indoor population density results in higher indoor to outdoor  PM-10 ratio.
