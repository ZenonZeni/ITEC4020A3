DIETARY GUIDELINES OKAY MODERATE DRINKING;
CSPI HEAD CALLS THEM APPROPRIATE


     Last week's release of the 1995 "Dietary Guidelines for
Americans" marked the end of a change in official attitude toward
bev/al.  Where a decade ago, bev/al was the target of a
neo-Prohibitionist crusade, now moderate consumption is viewed as
appropriate.
     Indeed, the attitude in Washington had so changed that
Michael Jacobson, executive director of Center for Science in the Public
Interest and a long-time opponent of the bev/al industry, was overheard
telling a Knight-Ridder reporter:  "I think it's okay to mention alcohol.
The Guidelines clearly don't encourage excessive drinking.  You'd have
to be inebriated to think the Guidelines encourage excessive drinking."
     In a major departure from the 1990 Guidelines, the new version
eliminates previous commentary that alcohol consumption "has no net
health benefit" and "is not recommended."
     They note "current evidence' that suggests moderate drinking is
"associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease."  And in its
advice section, the Guidelines state:  "If you drink alcoholic beverages,
do so in moderation, with meals, and when consumption does not put
you or others at risk."
     The significance of the change was emphasized by Dr. Philip
Lee, assistant secretary of health:  "In my personal view, wine with meals
is beneficial.  There was a significant bias in the past against drinking.
To move from anti-alcohol to health benefits is a big change."
     Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services, added
that the guidelines acknowledge "what most of us have known all along:
food is not just fuel, it is one of life's greatest pleasures."
     Needless to say, publication of the Guidelines brought joy to
John DeLuca, president, Wine Institute, who seven years ago developed
a strategy of dealing with anti-alcohol sentiment by researching
scientific information showing health benefits of moderate consumption.
     He praised the Guidelines for more clearly distinguishing
moderation from abuse, noting harmful effects when alcohol is
"consumed in excess" and listing dangers associated with only "higher
levels of alcohol intake," "too much alcohol" and "heavy drinkers."
     Meanwhile, Fred A. Meister, president/ceo, Distilled Spirits
Council of the U.S., praised the Federal Government for "recognizing
that distilled spirits plays a role in the lifestyle and diet of adult
Americans."
     He said removal of language that drinking has "no net health
benefit" and inclusion of the potential health benefit of moderate
drinking "of distilled spirits or other bev/al is an important
acknowledgment of the growing body of scientific studies on the
subject."

British Study Okays Moderate Drinking, Sets Higher Limits than U.S.


     Less than three weeks before the new Dietary Guidelines were
released in Washington, the British Government's Department of
Health reported that "it is now established that the main specific
pathology which benefits from alcohol consumption is coronary heart
disease."  There is, it said, "very likely" a protective effect from alcohol.
     The report offers daily, rather than the previous weekly,
benchmarks for safe drinking.  The benchmarks are higher than the
U.S. version:  eight to 12 ounces of wine for women 12 to 16 ounces a
day for men.

Budget Impasse Threatens CSAP,
But May Also Imperil Industry Programs


     Industry executives are hardly shedding tears that the Center
for Substance Abuse Prevention has been virtually shut down by the
current budget impasse.  Most executives view CSAP, a unit of the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration, as a hotbed of
biased anti-alcohol activity, an agency many view as playing fast and
loose with the facts and the law.
     But we talked last week with a highly respected political
operative who -- while he certainly was shedding no tears for SAMHA
-- warned that the budget battle, which has nearly closed the
Department of Health and Human Services, could hurt the industry too.
     He fears the result will be that every nook and cranny of the
federal budget will be examined, imperiling such things as the Market
Promotion Program, studies on the health effects of alcohol, research
for viticulture, proposed changes in the Internal Revenue Code dealing
with phylloxera and the industry's quest to roll back that big tax increase
five years ago.
     While the House Republicans are widely believed not to want a
budget deal -- unless they get everything they want -- the simple fact is
that a lot of rank and file House Democrats don't want a deal, either.
They believe the current standoff will bolster their changes of regaining
control of the House.

Vermont Adopts a Liquor "Fee"


     Vermont Liquor Control Board imposed a 20 cents a bottle
"fee" on four sizes of distilled spirits, effective Jan. 1.
     The increase, levied without industry or consumer consultation,
applies to 200 ml,  375 ml, 750 ml and 1 liter bottles.
     Fred A. Meister, president/ceo, Distilled Spirits COuncil of the
U.S., said he was "extremely disappointed and puzzled by this ill-advised
and discriminatory price increase on distilled spirits.  This decision was
made without the input of the people who will be most affected --
Vermont consumers and the producers and suppliers of distilled spirits.
We urge them to reconsider."
     State and local taxes paid on a typical purchase in Vermont are
111% greater than in neighboring New Hampshire.
     Monita Fontaine, DISCUS state government relations director,
wondered why, if the Board's goal was to raise additional revenue,
should it focus on distilled spirits, which represent less than 29% of
alcohol purchased in the state.  The revenue burden on distilled spirits
in Vermont is 108% more than the burden per alcohol gallon on beer
and 65% greater than the burden on table wines, Fontaine said.

Pataki Vetos Reciprocal Shipping Bill
In New York, Questioning Benefits


     A bill to permit out-of-state wineries, individuals or licensees to
ship wine for personal use into New York State was vetoed by Gov.
George Pataki.
     Pataki noted that supporters had said the bill would encourage
the sale of wine from New York wineries, benefit the tourism industry,
and enhance New York's reputation as a wine-producing state.
     "I am not convinced the bill would, in fact, benefit New York's
reputation as a wine-producing state.  And I am extremely concerned
about the potentially negative impact this bill, if enacted, would have on
existing, licensed New York State businesses relying on wine sales, as
well as its impact on New York wineries and jobs."
     Indeed, Pataki said he thought the result would be increased
mail-order sales of California wines, leading to lower sales for New
York liquor stores and distributors, a shrunken market share for New
York wineries within the state.
     New York tax authorities estimated the bill would result in the
loss of $1 per case in excise tax revenue, $10 per case in sales tax
revenue and local governments would also lose $10 a case in sales tax
revenue.
