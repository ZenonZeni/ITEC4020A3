Newsletter Profile</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Libby Wilson</FONT></P>

<P>What is it like being a doctor in Africa for ten months, with minimal
sanitation, equipment, manpower, and sometimes little more than your wits
and the will to do some good?</P>

<P>Dr Libby Wilson knows. Shortly after a friend had introduced her to
VESS, she accepted a post in Sierra Leone, for which she was paid a pittance.
In her subsequent book Unexpected Always Happen, she tells the tale of
her adventure there. It took her back, in some ways, to 1946, when she
was studying in a Kings College Hospital, London, when the five senses
were used for diagnosis rather than sophisticated technology. &quot;There
were hardly any diseases we had treatment for that worked.&quot; It is
in the last 50 years, leading to her retirement a few years ago, that she
has seen the big changes. &quot;In those days, we no longer 'tasted the
urine', but apart from that medicine was just as it had been for 200 years.&quot;
In those years end-of-life decisions just didn't happen: people either
lived or died.</P>

<P>Her interest in v.e came into sharper focus when her husband died in
1977. He had been a professor of medicine and knew exactly what was happening
when he was dying of stomach cancer. The heroic surgery failed. Before
this, working as a part-time G.P. for 18 years, Libby rarely came into
close contact with death. But human issues had always concerned her. She
can feel justifiably proud of fighting the good fight on women's issues
where she has worked in community care, providing support for prostitutes
and rape victims and, in the area of her especial expertise, contraceptive
advice. Controversy is no stranger to her and she hopes she lives to see
v.e. reform. Since being coopted onto the VESS Committee in 1990, Libby's
main contribution has been the Glasgow &amp; West of Scotland Group and
its newsletter Views &amp; News. She feels the campaign for v.e. is going
well but, from her background in community care, is especially concerned
that the caring side is not neglected, and has helped to initiate support
visits, for instance, for Glasgow VESS members who are alone in hospital.</P>
