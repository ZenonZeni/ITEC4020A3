<p align="center"><b>Michigan Lawyer Still Being Persecuted By
The Feds<br>
After Serving Eight Months In Prison For </b><b><u>ONE</u></b><b>
Joint!</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 16, Bay City, Michigan, in the latest twist in a
federal marijuana case involving attorney Edward Czuprynski, the
full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, all fifteen
judges, ruled <i>en banc</i> that a search of Czuprynski's law
office and home was constitutional. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski was federally indicted in May, 1992 for 1.6 grams of
marijuana [about a joint -ed.].&nbsp; Following a trial, he was
sentenced to serve a whopping 14 months in a federal penitentiary.&nbsp;
After eight months, however, a panel of three judges on the U.S.
Court of Appeals ordered Czuprynski's release from prison in July
of 1993 and ruled in his favor four months later on constitutional
grounds, the first of seven issues Czuprynski raised on appeal. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Upon the government's appeal, the full court's recent decision
examined only one raised constitutional issue and sent the case
back to the original three judge panel to review and rule on the
remaining six issues. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In the 11-4 split decision, the dissenting justices commented
that they &quot;can not condone the type of prosecutorial
overkill that has taken place here,&quot; adding that &quot;it
only points out the great expense of this court's time and
resources in hearing a case <i>en banc</i> [which involves] such
an insignificant amount of marijuana.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski said he is considering an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court and has secured the commitment from the American Civil
Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild to support his
effort. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Czuprynski commented that &quot;I may have lost the latest
battle, but I'm confident I'll win this war,&quot; adding that,
&quot;the conviction against me resulted from a real railroading
that trampled all over my rights.&quot; </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For further information on this truly bizarre case, contact
attorney Edward Czuprynski at 517-894-1155.&nbsp; The U.S.
Attorneys Office that is prosecuting [persecuting -ed.] Mr.
Czuprynski can be reached for comment at 517-895-5712.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>U.S. House Resolution 97 -- Seeks To Create
Law Enforcement &quot;Rapid Strike Force&quot;<br>
To Aid America's </b><b><u>Failed</u></b><b> Drug War</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">January 4, U.S. Representative Barbara Kennelly (D-CT)
introduced a bill to the Committee on the Judiciary that would,
among other things: </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Empower the Attorney General to establish in the FBI a unit,
to be known as The Rapid Deployment Force (RDF), which shall be
made available to assist units of local government in combating
crime. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-The RDF will be comprised of approximately <b>2,500 Federal
law enforcement officers with training and experience
in...drug-related crime</b>.&nbsp; [emphasis added -ed.] </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">-Members of the RDF who are deployed to a jurisdiction shall
be deputized...as to empower such officers to make arrests and
participate in the prosecution of criminal offenses under State law. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">(For a copy of H.R. 97 [cite as: Rapid Deployment Strike Force
Act -ed.], contact Rep. Kennelly at 202-225-2265.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>MTV Affirms Its Censoring Of Music Videos</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 10, a Johnson County Community College <b>NORML</b>
member e-mailed an inquiry to MTV regarding it's censoring of Tom
Petty's hit music video &quot;You Don't Know How It
Feels&quot;.&nbsp; MTV's reply follows: <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">MTV has very strict program standards...MTV will not air videos,
images, or messages that promote or condone the use of illegal
substances.&nbsp; We asked Tom Petty's record label to edit &quot;You
Don't Know How It Feels,&quot; deleting the reference to smoking
a joint so that the clip would meet our standards guidelines.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Pot Case Could Set Precedent In Kansas</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">February 3, The <i>Topeka Capital-Journal</i> reported on the
conviction of two Douglas County residents suspected of watering
172 marijuana plants.&nbsp; The defendants Nancy Hadley and
Michael Wyman were charged with multiple felonies [including
intent to distribute, conspiracy, etc...] that could have yielded
them more than 40 years in prison. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Wyman's attorney, Pedro Irigonegaray, commented that the
defendant was willing to admit to the possession charge, but not
to the multiple charges for distribution. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>NORML National Legal Committee (NLC) member William K. Rork</b>,
Hadley's attorney, asserted that the government erred in
assigning the potential weight of the 172 plants at 840 pounds. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rork and Irigonegaray called upon <i>High Times</i> editor Ed
Rosenthal, an expert on cannabis cultivation, to refute the
government's assertion. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rosenthal testified that 1.) the total bud yield from the 172
plants when mature would have been approximately 9.6 pounds and,
2.) the shelf life of marijuana is indefinite if frozen.&nbsp;
Therefore, the defendants were able to effectively claim that the
marijuana they were alleged to possess was compatible with
personal use. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The jury agreed.&nbsp; Hadley and Wyman will likely receive
probation on two misdemeanor charges according to Irigonegaray. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The <i>Capital-Journal</i> reports that one officer said this
case sets a dangerous precedent [For law enforcement! -ed.]. </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">[For more information on this potentially precedent setting
case in challenging the weight assigned to grown marijuana --
that at the very least has a substantial impact on sentencing -- contact <b>NORML
NLC member</b> attorney William Rork at 913-233-7428 or cannabis
cultivation expert Ed Rosenthal, 510-533-0605.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Trading The Fourth Amendment For A Baggie Of
Pot</b> </p>

<p><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">If anyone doubts the importance of the role played by
marijuana prohibition in undermining the Constitution, consider
the case currently before the Supreme Court, <u>Arizona v. Evans</u> (#93-1660).&nbsp;
The case at bar, which threatens the Fourth Amendment
requirements of a valid warrant, involves an arrest for
possession of &quot;a baggie&quot; of marijuana. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Because marijuana is so widely used by so many Americans, the
enforcement of prohibition frequently brings up constitutional
challenges that impact the lives of all non-violent citizens. </p>
