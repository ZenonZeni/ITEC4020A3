<strong>Action: </strong> Notice of Presolicitation Conference

<strong>Summary:</strong> The Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management
(OCRWM) issued a request for <a href="eoi.htm">Expression of Interest (EOI) and

(Vol.61103 page 26508) regarding its planned acquisition of
services for transportation of spent nuclear  fuel and other
associated activities.  These notices provided general information
related to the scope of services sought by OCRWM, contract type,
contract term, schedule, and requested comments on six issues. 
OCRWM now desires to hold a presolicitation conference as a follow-on to the EOI Notice where input on technical and contractual
issues can be obtained.  The presolicitation conference is a
preliminary step in the acquisition process that may or may not
result in an actual Request for Proposal (RFP) at a later date.

<strong>Date & Location: </strong> The presolicitation conference will be held on
Tuesday, July 9, 1996, from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in the main
