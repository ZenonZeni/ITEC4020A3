PORTUGAL HOPES EU LOAN FUNDING WILL SPARK MINI-HYDRO REVIVAL

Companies hope that a new European Union-backed government fund will
breathe new life into the mini-hydro power sector in Portugal, where
investment has been brought to a virtual standstill by falling
electricity prices, a shortage of funds and, mainly, lack of support
from municipal authorities.

Projects have received a welcome impetus in the shape of a Es1.1bn
($7.3m) loan from Programa Energia, a fund set up in mid-1995 to
promote the diversification, expansion and improvement of energy
production and use.

This first allocation of money from the fund goes to three companies
that are investing in four small hydro-electric generating plants with
a total capacity of just under 30 MW.

They are Hidrocorgo, Hidroerg and HDN-Energia do Norte. Another 36
similar projects are being evaluated by the Energia programme, which is
expected to mobilise a total investment of Es180bn, mainly focused on
stimulating natural gas use, as well as rational energy utilisation and
diversification into renewable energy resources.

Hidrocorgo is part of the Enersis group, the biggest mini-hydro
constructor and operator in Portugal, in which Midland Electricity
Board of the UK has a holding of about 35%. Enersis has so far
installed 50 MW in 15 mini-hydro plants.

Antonio Sa da Costa, head of Portugal's Water Resources Association,
told FTWB that since legislation permitting small-scale private energy
production was introduced in May 1988, mini-hydro generating plants
with a total capacity of 140 MW and involving investments totalling
Es30bn have been built in Portugal. Mini-hydro plants are defined as
having a maximum capacity of 10 MW.

The liberalisation led to a rush of project proposals and applications
for almost 1,000 licenses to build mini-hydros had been made by 1991.
However, by 1993 only 120 licenses had been granted. Sa da Costa says
many applications were for identical sites, others proved technically
or economically non-viable, and many prospective investors found that
their projects would be far more costly than they had anticipated.

Companies have also been discouraged from entering the sector by a 40%
drop in the price of electricity to industrial consumers from 1988 to
1993. Until recently, small producers sold energy to Electricidade de
Portugal, the state power utility, at rates based on industrial
tariffs. Partly because of this, new construction of mini-hydro plants
almost came to a halt after 1993, when funding from the European
Union's Valoren programme ended.

However, Sa da Costa says the biggest obstacle to investment in mini-
hydros is now a lack of support from municipal authorities and
opposition from local populations. "Mini-hydros are one of the most
environmentally-friendly means of producing energy," he says. "But a
lack of information has led to opposition to small hydro plants in many
Portuguese localities, by residents who fear, wrongly, that the plants
will damage their rivers."

The transfers of the approval of the water resource and public works
components of mini-hydros from a central body to local authorities has
put a further brake on expansion. Only one licence has been granted
since the change was made in February 1994. "Lack of information and
lack of support from water resource bodies are our biggest enemy," says
Sa da Costa.

Companies will be lobbying Portugal's new Socialist government for a
more supportive approach to licensing. Sa da Costas believes that this,
together with soft loans from the Energia programme, will stimulate
renewed investment in small-scale hydro-production.

Portugal's legislation was changed in November, moving it towards the
German model in the form of a commitment to pay producers of energy
from renewable sources higher rates than companies who produce energy
from fossil fuels. EDP's regulations have also been changed. Mini-hydro
producers were previously paid different rates according to the output
voltage of the energy they supplied. A single rate has now been
established at the top end of the previous scale.

A further 150 MW of mini-hydro capacity could be built by 1999.
Portugal's total possible capacity is estimated at 300-400 MW. Current
capacity accounts for 420 GWh a year - enough to supply about 600,000
domestic consumers - out of Portugal's total consumption of about 24
TWh. This saves the county an estimated Es2bn a year in oil bills.

Funds under the Energia programme are loaned at zero interest and have
to be paid back over 12 years. No repayments have to be made for the
first three years. Plants, costing an average of Es2bn-2.5bn, take a
maximum of two years to build. This means companies can pay back the
loans from the earnings of their generating plants.

SHOULD SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR DROUGHT CUTS?

The latest (proposed) tweak of the regulatory screw must leave the UK
water companies wondering what else they are to made liable for. In a
consultation document published on 20 December the economic regulator,
OFWAT, asks for comment on a suggested scheme of compensation payments
to customers suffering supply cuts as a result of drought.

OFWAT is responding to a government request for advice on compensation
issues raised by the 1995 drought. The Environment Secretary  sought
the advice in the face of the changed public attitude to water supply,
now seen increasingly as a pure money making operation rather than a
public service; a hostile response to supplier pleas for conservation
during the drought indicated that, now water supply is a commercial
operation, the customer expects no cuts, whatever the reason. Before
1989 the heads of the public water authorities would have had little
hesitation in pointing out that such expectations were unrealistic.
Provision for supplying water and for carrying away storm sewage is
based on an assessment of risks made from analysis of past rainfall
statistics. On the supply side the infrastructure is sized to guarantee
supplies for particular minimum annual rainfall conditions judged
likely to occur only once in a certain number of years. Storm sewers
are similarly designed for particular likely `return periods', in this
case looking at the maximum storm intensity and duration likely to be
encountered. In both cases more rare events could be catered for, but
with a corresponding increase in infrastructure cost.

It is only a little over a year since OFWAT concluded a detailed look
at company business plans and set price limits for the next five years.
Those limits are based on certain service standards specified in a
`Guaranteed Standards Scheme' (GSS). Suppliers are obliged to pay
compensation if any of the standards are breached and all of the items
covered, such as response times to account queries or consumer
complaints, are clearly within company control. Equally clearly
rainfall is outside company control and supply cuts caused by lack of
rain are not included in the GSS. Nevertheless the basic engineering
underlying supply infrastructure has a proven record - there have been
no supply cuts under Emergency Drought Orders in England and Wales
since 1976.

Surely this was a realistic way to look at service provision and, if
companies are now to be required to cater for more severe drought
conditions than allowed for in current business plans the new targets,
agreed by the economic and resources regulators, must first be clearly
stated? If companies were then obliged to guarantee supplies in
conditions of, say 75% rather than 80% of average long-term rainfall
they might reasonably be made liable to pay compensation, but only if
the requisite infrastructure was not provided. This might be done by
more provision for inter-company or inter-regional transfers rather
than from increased abstractions/infrastructure in the supply area
concerned.

Any open-ended liability for compensation may well provide, as the
consultation paper suggests, "....a powerful financial
incentive.......to balance the costs of resources against the costs of
(supply) restrictions," but, on the one hand the suggested daily
compensation payment of around #10 (based on average bills) seems
little enough for the inconvenience that some consumers might suffer;
on the other hand many might think that a rare inconvenience arising
from the vagaries of nature should not be disguised as something a
water company could have prevented.

This attitude was certainly apparent last summer when the water
companies collectively rejected an OFWAT suggestion of compensation on
the grounds that the weather conditions were exceptional. One or two
companies, not in areas threatened by supply cuts, later offered
compensation where heavy demand caused loss of supply pressure but,
according to the consultation paper, no suppliers have agreed that use
of rota cuts or standpipes forced by drought will constitute a reason
for compensation. That stance  was well judged - although such measures
have not been needed for nearly 20 years the trend in climate-induced
pressure on supplies can be seen from the 22-year record on hosepipe
bans. Bans on household use of hosepipes are an early step on the path
to conservation when drought conditions threaten. As the illustration
shows bans have been imposed on 10% or more of the population in 5 of
the last 7 years but in only 3 of the previous 15 years.

In commenting on another climate-induced supply problem over the
Christmas/New Year period the Socialist opposition spokesman on the
environment suggested that a higher staffing level in some companies in
the north-east of England might have produced a quicker response to
supply failures. He was talking about pipe bursts caused by
exceptionally low temperatures followed by a rapid swing to warmer
weather. Although the company pipes concerned will have been laid at
depths regarded as standard for forty or fifty years there was an
immediate public outcry accompanied by newspaper and radio reports
suggesting possible fault on the part of the suppliers. Will low
temperatures be next on the government list for a compulsory
compensation scheme?

* The principle recommendations in the consultation paper are :

Compensation payments of #10 per customer per day, up to a maximum of
#100, for drought-imposed rota cuts or standpipe supply for a day or
part day.

Compensation of #25 in any year for frequent poor pressure supplies
caused by drought conditions

An entitlement for business customers to claim compensation for losses
arising from the imposition of Drought Orders. (Changes needed to
primary legislation)

No general compensation for customers affected by hosepipe bans but
affected metered customers  may receive #25 per year compensation.

COMPANIES WAIT FOR RAIN AS DROUGHT FEARS PERSISTS

For suppliers and the resources regulator, the National Rivers
Authority (NRA), drought fears have persisted into the new year after
heavy rainfall in September failed to continue into the later autumn
and early winter. Perversely even the heavy rain that did occur missed
much of the area worst affected by low rainfall last summer. By mid-
December many soils were reported far from saturated and groundwater
recharge and reservoir refilling was declared minimal.

The NRA supplied a second resource status report* to the environment
minister in December. The report outlines the measures individual
companies must take during the coming months to reduce the risk of
supply interruptions next summer. A central theme is maximum
abstractions from rivers to replenish reservoirs during the hoped-for
wetter winter months, avoiding the need for environmentally damaging
over-abstraction in the lower flow periods of summer. Severn Trent is
currently involved in a Public Inquiry, facing protests from fishing
interests over proposed increased river abstractions. Yorkshire Water,
where some areas remain under real threat of imposed rota cuts, is also
subject to environmental protests over proposed abstraction increases.

The NRA report lists company estimates of the possible 1996 outcomes
assuming average and 80% of average rainfall. Only four of the ten
major utilities express confidence for uninterrupted supplies next
summer. It might have been more logical to report on a uniform known
risk, for example the minimum rainfall conditions likely to recur in
each supply region once in ten years. This would mean rainfall of 70%
of long term average in some areas and 90% in others. As it is the risk
of 80% normal winter rainfall in Anglian region is 1 in 5 years and in
the North East 1 in 16 years.

The speed at which the drought overtook England and Wales and the
adverse public reaction to enforced supply restrictions has shaken the
industry. Only 10 months ago, in February 1995, even the NRA reported
that the resources outlook was good. At some time or other in the
following summer months 7million people, including business customers,
were banned from non-essential water use; 18 million were subjected to
hosepipe bans and many suffered interrupted supplies or low flows at
times of peak demand. Now, in mid-winter, hosepipe bans continue in
areas supplied by Severn Trent, North West and Yorkshire Water. Some
Yorkshire customers may yet see standpipes used and, over large areas
of the country, only exceptional rain in the coming 3 months will avert
major supply inconveniences next summer.

Suppliers had good reason to point to exceptional circumstances in
rejecting suggestions of compensation payments. The illustration shows
a continuous decline in rainfall from March to August. Accompanied by
unusual levels of sunshine - above normal in each month to November -
and with average temperatures at or above normal, this combined to set
evaporation rates at record levels.

There have been some positive outcomes. It has brought home to all
concerned, far better than any questionnaire, that the highest customer
priority is not clean bathing beaches or Class I rivers; it is a
continuous adequate water supply. The most immediate effect has been a
new look at leakage and a revised company programme to cut losses. In
the longer term it should send a message to government to maintain a
robust approach to any new proposals from Brussels. If things go badly
this summer some revision of the Urban Waste Water Directive programme
may be needed, a matter the government  raised in Brussels in the run-
up to the 1994 Prices Review.

SPAIN STAYS CAUTIOUS ON DROUGHT DESPITE RAINS

The wettest December for at least 30 years, following the first really
wet November after four years of the century's worst drought, has
brought relief to vast areas of central-southern Spain.

But experts were in general agreement that the drought was not over by
early January and there would have to be substantial rain this spring
before celebrations could start.

In essence, most areas have their short-term domestic consumption needs
resolved, but except for the western region  of Extremadura bordering
Portugal, irrigation restrictions will continue. This in spite of the
fact that many reservoirs in the southern water authorities of the
Guadiana, Guadalquivir and Tajo (Tagus) rivers saw dramatic increases
in reserves in little more than two weeks.

Some Andalucian dams in the south that were technically dry at
Christmas held up to 30% of capacity by 3 January. The average held in
the dams in the southern water authority regions was Guadiana (27.4%),
Guadalquivir (24.6%), Sur 24.4%) and Segura (12.5%). In nearly all
cases, the figure had been below 10% at Christmas.

The 14 dams run by Madrid's Canal de Isabel II water authority saw
reserves increase by 27% to over 47% of capacity between Christmas Eve
and January 3, but this was still below the 54.4% of exactly a year
before in full drought. Canal authorities remained cautious. Madrid's
last hydrological year which ended in September, was the driest since
1912.

The western half of Spain benefited most from the rain, to such an
extent that Portugal had to ask Spain to retain the flow of the Tagus
in the Valdecanas y Gabriel and Galan dams to avoid flooding the
Portuguese city of Santarem. But in some parts of the south-east -
Almeria, Murcia, southern Valencia - the improvement has been minimal.

The exploitation directors of the Guadalquivir, Guadiana, Sur and
Segura basins in the south, where more than eight million people suffer
daily restrictions, suggested that some restrictions could be eased by
mid-January. However, this was less likely in Segura in the far south-
east, where hydrographical confederation director Manuel Miron said on
January 2. "We have disgustingly splendid weather, with a completely
blue sky and temperatures above 25xC."

In the Guadiana region bordering Portugal, confederation chairman
Antonio Alcaraz was jubilant. "For the first time in four years I am
going to enjoy watching the partial emptying of a dam in Extremadura.
We've had two anxious years to get emergency works built around the
city of Badajoz, and now we have too much water." The Guadiana dams in
the Andalucia (or far southern) area held an amazing 79% of capacity on
January 3.

The Andalucian cities of Seville, Cordoba and Cadiz were likely to see
domestic restrictions eased as local dams filled, but Malaga and most
of the rest of the Costa del Sol will probably continue to suffer
restrictions.

NEW YORK MEETS STRONG OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED WATER ASSETS SALE

Since the 1970s, New York City (NYC), America's most populated city,
has struggled to balance a steadily eroding tax base against the rising
costs of providing municipal services to its eight million residents.
The scenario is increasingly duplicated in virtually all large cities
across the country. As part of the fiscal 1996 budget the Mayor
proposed transferring title to its water and sewer system assets to the
New York Water Board (NYWB) for $2.3bn.

The NYWB currently leases the water system from the city for a 40-year
term in return for lease and rental payments. NYWB was established as a
separate entity because state law prohibits a government agency from
issuing debt and at the same time setting rates and collecting user
fees, functions the NYWB performs. Although NYWB is considered semi-
independent, its seven members are appointed by the Mayor and its staff
are city employees.

Under the budget proposal, the NYWB will borrow money to make the
purchase, repaying over 30 years with revenues from water charges. The
city's Water Financing Authority (WFA), set up to finance the building
and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems, will issue about
$2.5 billion of revenue bonds (first and second resolution). NYC will
then retire or annul its current $1.3bn of outstanding general
obligation bonds originally issued for water and sewer projects before
NYWB was created. The balance of the sale price will be used over the
next four years for critical repairs to a broad range of infrastructure
costing about $200 million annually. It would also eliminate the much-
criticised $207 million tax receivables sale programme, under which the
city paid a bank to collect taxes and received an amount equal to those
taxes a year before their due date.

Capital assets involved in the sale are 18 reservoirs in three upstate
watersheds, thousands of miles of tunnels and mains, and 14 sewage
treatment plants. The price tag of $2.3bn was determined, not on the
value of plant beyond its construction cost, some of which is very old,
but on the projected lease payments the NYWB would make over the next
30 years, assuming a 7% interest rate. Although there is a school of
thought that believes the proposed sale price doesn't reflect the true
market value of the water system, which could be determined only by
competitive bidding, a majority of the city council oppose outright
privatisation.

Proponents of the proposal argue that it means an end to NYWB's
payments to the city. Eliminating these rent payments will provide
savings to hold down water rates. Water fees would be used to pay for
the bonds over 30 years, while the rent payments would be unending. The
sale is termed "rate neutral," and ratepayers will have new security
because the NYWB, instead of paying a continuing stream of rental
payments, will owe a finite payment over a defined length of time. NYC
could use the approximate $1bn for capital and other projects, money
that would have otherwise been borrowed at higher cost.

Opponents of the proposal are equally vehement, one of whom is the
city's own Comptroller. For months he has resisted pressure from the
Mayor and council to sign the documents necessary to execute the bond
transaction. He characterised the proposal as an "illegal gimmick."
"It's illegal," he claims, "because the WFA's authority does not extend
beyond borrowing for building and maintenance. It's `"gimmicky' because
we will pay for the water system twice." Because of statements the
Mayor has made, the Comptroller also believes some of the $1bn bond
revenue will be used to pay for operating expenses not covered by tax
revenue shortfalls. It was this very practice that brought NYC to the
brink of bankruptcy in the mid 1970s.

The New York Times has lined up with the opponents saying that "... the
legal issues are complicated and subject to differing interpretations.
But we continue to believe that it would be unwise public policy for
the city to sell a vast and valuable asset to pay for construction
projects over the next four years ... and the sale poses a potential
threat to the upstate reservoirs once control of all the system passes
from NYC ..."

There is concern that the state Governor, thought to be sympathetic to
greater development of upstate regions housing the reservoirs, could
change the NYWB composition and weaken the city's control of the three
watersheds that supply its raw water (FTWB, Issue 51, p6).

Municipal bond market operators have not forgotten that the city in
1975 was plunged into a fiscal crisis when the then mayor borrowed
millions to meet operating expenses. They are watching these recent
developments closely as experts were already voicing concerns about
NYC's existing debt level. In July 1995 Standard & Poors lowered the
city's credit rating in part because of this proposed sale.

Court decisions now awaited

In November the city council sued the city Comptroller in the New York
State Supreme Court. It has requested a declaratory judgment on the
Comptroller's authority over the issuance of WFA debt. A ruling is
expected in February.

In a further development on 11 December, a coalition of eight New York
City and Westchester County civic, housing and environmental
organisations filed suit in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan to
block the sale. Spearheading these opposing groups is the Natural
Resources Defence Council, a national environmental watchdog with a
staff of 150 and 170,000 members. Their suit alleges that the proposed
sale is illegal because the scheme would, among other things, divert
approximately $1bn in water and sewer monies for unrelated purposes.

ASEAN STATES PRESS CHINA TO CO-OPERATE ON MEKONG MANAGEMENT

Leaders of the seven Association of South East Asian Nations agreed to
push for the integrated development of the Mekong basin at their summit
in Bangkok. China, Laos, Burma and Cambodia will be invited to join a
regional forum with ASEAN to channel investment into the six nations
that depend upon the Mekong for much of their water supply, transport,
energy and agricultural needs.

"We require a more co-ordinated approach, after individual governments
and institutions have worked separately for the past few years. This
will be our first attempt at regional resource co-operation," Thai
prime minister Banharn Silapa-archa told the summit.

The move follows Burma's agreement to work with other riverine nations
in developing the basin. This left only China outside the Mekong River
Commission, a loose grouping of water users that is trying to promote
sustainable development of the Mekong. Burma has promised to attend
future meetings of the Commission, though only as an observer. Planning
minister Brigadier-General David Abel said at a Bangkok seminar that
Rangoon would join Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in jointly
exploiting the river's potential. China is regarded as the prime
target, however, because the Mekong originates in Yunnan province and
one-quarter of the 4,200-kilometre river is in Chinese territory.

Financiers wary of funding further Chinese dams

"Beijing is under pressure from international (financial) institutions
to negotiate with downstream countries before they will put up any more
cash for dams. There's been too much bad feeling over their earlier
schemes," said a European banker based in Bangkok.

Water levels in the river dropped alarmingly in 1993 when China opened
Manwan dam, the first of eight reservoirs it is building on Mekong
tributaries, prompting protests from neighbouring countries.

The Commission is expected to press China for closer consultation on
water flows from the dams, especially with Laos and Vietnam. Land-
locked Laos needs ample water in the dry season to irrigate its rice
crops, and much of the country is now facing a famine because of
inadequate supplies. Vietnam depends upon high river levels to dilute
high saline levels in the Mekong delta, which is the country's main
food producer.

Initial response from the Chinese has not been too encouraging. Go Xin,
vice-manager of Yannan's Environmental Monitoring Centre, told the Thai
seminar that  "The Manwan dam will help purify the water by breaking
down pollutants and will stop erosion of the river bank. It has no
effect upon the water flow downstream."

NORWEGIAN GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS AID FUNDING FOR DAM SCHEMES

NORAD, the Norwegian state development aid agency, has broken its own
rules regarding impartial evaluation of an African hydro power project
which is a candidate for development aid funding.

The project under scrutiny is the Lower Kihansi development in
Tanzania, being undertaken by Tanesco, a local utility. A Norwegian
firm, Norplan, has conducted both the technical and the environmental
analyses of the scheme, although NORAD guidelines say the companies
undertaking those functions should be quite independent of each other.

NORAD support for Lower Kihansi was being considered, earlier this
year, in connection with the possible participation in the project of
Norway's Kvaerner group. It was temporarily blocked on the advice of
NVE, the Norwegian state Water Resources and Energy Administration, and
of the Directorate for Natural Resources Management (DN), an arm of the
Environment Ministry. Both argued that Norplan's first environmental
analysis was inadequate, and that a new study was needed to decide if
aid was appropriate

A second study - again, by Norplan - was completed during the summer.
The Norwegian environmental newsletter N & M Bulletin says that NVE has
classified as "secret" all the documents connected with this latest
study, but the newsletter "understands" that the second analysis "is
just as poor as the first. The result could be a new rejection by DN
and ... NVE."

"In its first statement DN expressed great concern about the
environmental aspects of the hydro power scheme. In the affected area
there are many unique local species which could be completely
exterminated. The high waterfall in the river system creates... a
specially damp climate, which fosters a very rich fauna and flora.
Another concern relates to the consequences of road building through
the jungle, and the impact on the local population, which will feel the
pressure from thousands of workers and others connected with the huge
development."

Chile project also questioned

Norway's Environment Ministry is critical, too, of another giant hydro
project - Chile's Bio-Bio scheme - which has secured NORAD support. In
August last year - despite strong opposition from Norwegian
environmentalists - development aid minister Kari Nordheim-Larsen
announced that NORAD would provide so-called mixed credits for Bio-Bio.

The newsletter claims to have a copy of an internal Environment
Ministry memo which is highly critical of the project, casting it as an
example of a scheme that has been granted support without adequate
justification. The Ministry believes the aid decision was dubious and
suggests `bit by bit' tactics were used to aid an apparently limited
scheme that paved the way for a larger project

The same memo is sceptical towards third world hydro power projects
generally, pointing out that they "often have significant detrimental
effects both on the environment and on the population groups affected.
Far larger population groups, economic interests and environmental
values are affected, as a rule, than is the case with developments in
our part of the world."

JORDAN SAYS RED-DEAD LINK VITAL-ISRAEL NOT SO SURE

The Dead Sea lives down to its name. The only crops that grow around it
are fed by a few streams and what's left of the Jordan River after
everyone in the region has grabbed the bulk of the water and polluted
what's left. But regularly, there are heavy downpours on the hills that
flank its Eastern shore. These turn the usually light waters of the
Wadi Mujib into a raging torrent which pour through clefts in the rock
wall into the Dead Sea with only minimal entrapment by a water-short
population in Jordan's arid highlands of Moab.

The Jordanian Government is now promoting a scheme to trap the waters
of the Mujib and another nearby basin, the Hasa, to promote irrigated
development at the lower end of the Dead Sea where the Jordanian and
Israeli authorities intend to create the Lowest Park on Earth. Zafer al-
Alem, a senior official at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation, says
the Mujib and Hasa entrapment scheme, known by its local name as the
Southern Ghors, should ensure a net gain of 54m cubic metres (mcm) per
year.

The Southern Ghors Project is the smallest, but most immediate, of
Jordan's major water schemes. But in essence it only helps to postpone
hard decisions concerning water use and water availability. The
Jordanian authorities estimate that before they signed their Peace
Treaty with Israel in October 1994, their country's annual supply of
ground and surface water totalled only some 670mcm. And yet, according
to Mr. Qusei Qteishat, the Secretary General of the Ministry of Water
and Irrigation, by the year 2005 they will need 1,400mcm.

Zafer al-Alem estimates that some 215 mcm/year should come Jordan's way
as a result of the Treaty, partly by use of water stored in the Israeli-
 controlled Sea of Galilee, and partly from new dams on the Yarmuk
River that can go ahead given agreement between Israel and Jordan in
one case, and Jordan and Syria in the other. In addition, Jordan hopes
to complete a second priority project over the next seven years, the
transfer of water from the Disi aquifer in Southern Jordan, via a 310-
km pipeline; expected yield 80-100 mcm/y.

To make up the remaining 270 mcm/y it believes will be required by the
year 2005, the Ministry is planning an intensive campaign to re-use
existing water. But, as Zafer al- Alem told FTWB, "after ten years, the
problem will re-emerge. Then we will have to complete the Red-Dead
Canal."

But all these projects cost money and Jordan is not a rich country. The
relatively modest projects for the Southern Ghors are costed at
$254.2m, while the Disi pipeline, for which a feasibility study is
currently under way, is estimated at $405m. As for the Red Sea-Dead Sea
canal, this is costed at anything from $3.2bn upwards.

Detailed designs for the three dams in the Southern Ghors project at
Wala, Mujib and Tannur have already been completed, and detailed
designs for the Mujib weir and conveyer system, the largest single
element in the project, are due for completion in early 1996.

The Jordanians see the Southern Ghors as a progressive project, to be
implemented over an eight-year period. This should make it easier to
finance, since they are looking for three-quarters of the money to come
from foreign assistance, and donors generally prefer to disburse their
aid over a period of years.

Jordan also wants to improve the quality of its water. "We have
ambitious plans to clean the Jordan River, which receives a lot of
pollution," says Qteishat. "We plan to secure 10 mcm/y of desalinated
water from the springs around Tiberias (Sea of Galilee)," which he says
will be desalinated by Israel and passed on to Jordan. At present, he
says, "Israel pumps salt water out of Tiberias and passes it back to
the Jordan River. We want to make sure that no more waste water goes
into it."

Israel plans to do this by constructing what it calls a brine line from
Tiberias to the Dead Sea at a cost of $25.8 million. In addition, it
will also construct a desalination plant, possibly at Tabha, near some
brackish springs in the region, or else at Naharayim, near the border
with Jordan. Such a plant would cost around $23m and, overall, the
Israelis estimate the cost of desalination and improvement of water
quality in the Sea of Galilee as costing them a total of $98.9m over
the five years the project is expected to take. However, as well as
supplying Jordan with some 10mcm/y, a further 10-20mcm/y should be
available for Israeli consumption.

While Israel and Jordan are clearly committed in spirit, as well as in
law, to co-operating in the development of the Jordan Rift Valley, it
is clear that the level of cooperation can be expected to vary
considerably from project to project. The northern schemes are of
immediate benefit, and of generally definable and limited cost. The
practical benefits are also immediately obvious. One Jordanian
technologist involved in preparing his country's water plans, told FTWB
that Jordan expects to receive around 32 mcm/y of Israeli-sourced water
under the treaty. Almost all of this will be piped directly to Amman,
in effect providing almost one-third of the Jordanian capital's water
supply.

Given the tensions surrounding water issues in the Middle East,
Jordanian-Israeli co-operation on water management and development
since the 1994 peace treaty has been remarkable. Yet there are likely
to be some long term problems. The Jordanians are extremely keen on the
Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal which they genuinely appear to consider offers
the best prospect of meeting their additional water requirements in the
early 21st century. The project would yield an estimated 400 mcm/y
apiece to both Jordan and Israel, with desalination costs, Jordanian
officials aver, kept relatively low because the project can be powered
by the 400 metre level difference between the two seas.

However, it is equally clear that the Israelis are not so keen on the
project. One senior Israeli official told FTWB: "We consider this is a
dream. We want to see the economics clearly in place; so you can see
there is a difference of opinion" between Israel and Jordan.

To resolve such differences, the two countries have agreed to hire an
external consultant to report on the economics of the project. The
Jordanians hope the report will demonstrate the Canal's practicality
and financial viability. Since such a project would require massive
foreign aid, they are well aware that the Israelis will have to start
believing in it themselves if the scheme is to prove a success. For,
while aid donors may well be found if they see a real commitment from
both parties, scepticism from one partner is likely to produce
intensified scepticism amongst donors.

The key is whether Israel, which has more money to spend on developing
or importing alternative supplies, concludes that for political reasons
- continuing good relations with Jordan - it can gear itself up to
support the project with real enthusiasm. At present, this seems
unlikely. For Jordan, with less flexibility in terms of developing
alternative water sources, the project is considered vital if it is to
meet its most basic needs; for Israel there is no equivalent pressure.
As the Israeli official said: "We believe there is life without the Red
Sea-Dead Sea Canal."

AUCKLAND OPTS TO BOOST SUPPLIES WITH $55M PIPELINE FROM WAKATO RIVER

Auckland's Watercare Services has opted for a pipeline from the Waikato
River to meet future supply needs. In eliminating other options
Watercare is back to a plan very similar to an emergency proposal
floated at the height of a major drought in 1994. (FTWB, Issue 42, p2).

The water would be extracted from the river either by large diameter
bankside wells or infiltration galleries and pumped from the existing
Ardmore treatment station. The project will initially yield 80,000
cubic metres a day but would be designed to accommodate the possibility
of a second stage yielding 120,000 cubic metres per day around the year
2013.

The major difference over the previous emergency proposal is that this
project will have to go through normal planning permission processes.
The application to build the US$55m pipeline is likely to be filed in
March. It could take a year for all the consents to be granted,
following which there will be a 2 year construction period.  In the
meantime Watercare Services, which is a corporate entity owned by the
Auckland Regional Services Trust, is consulting local communities and
Maori tribes about the project.

Agreement of the Tainui tribe who claim ownership of the riverbed is
not a foregone conclusion. Nor is the agreement of all the local
authorities who will take the water. The Auckland district of Waitakere
City has considered going it alone with a combination of more efficient
water use and a dam project run by private enterprise.

Law changes will ease planning and funding negotiations

New legislation likely to be in place well before the process of
requesting planning permission starts will, however, make it easier for
Watercare Services to manage without the blessing of the receiving
local authorities  such as Waitakere.

Changes in the law will also provide more flexibility in selecting
funding options for this project and a major wastewater scheme. In
future, Watercare Services will be able to borrow commercially whereas
it currently has to give local authorities the right of first refusal
on whether to fund a project and it would be hard for it to proceed
without the backing of all the local authorities and loan guarantees
from them.

Watercare will in future also be authorised to reflect investment costs
in its pricing by including "the cost of its business requirements in
its prices and charges." At present it must set prices at a level which
recovers only the operating costs including interest and planned
maintenance and renewals.

Recent board changes at Watercare also mean the group is likely to be
more receptive to innovative finance proposals which involve private
operators, to the contracting out of services and buying in water from
other authorities rather than operating a closed shop monopoly.

SAO PAULO SETS LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR MAJOR WASTEWATER PROGRAMME

New water use legislation in Sao Paulo took a major step forward in
December with the approval of a master plan by the state council, a
consultative committee for the state assembly. The plan, Plano Estadual
de Recursos Hidricos, covers the period 1996 to 1999 and is based on
the user-pays principle and on the French model of administration
within river basin boundaries.The next step is for a detailed law to be
drawn up and voted on in the assembly.

Sao Paulo state has a population of 33 million and an area the size of
the United Kingdom. For the purposes of the water resources plan the
state has been divided into 22 river basin administrative areas.
Exploitation of state water resources, exclusive of treatment and
distribution, should have been charged for since 1991 according to
State Law 7.663 but this has so far been unenforced through lack of
complementary detailed legislation.

The first basin area to be created and where administration plans are
most advanced covers the Piracicaba, Capivari and Jundai rivers
situated just north of the Greater Sao Paulo connurbation. The basin
committee has already received $1.7m towards sanitation and water
supply schemes this year from a state fund, Fehidro, which comes from
royalty payments to areas flooded for hydroelectric schemes. Fehidro
should have $8.6m available for water schemes in 1996.

The Piracicaba/Capivari/Jundai Basin Committee, made up of
representatives from 57 municipalities and non-governmental
environmental organisations, has already held seven meetings and drawn
up a resources master plan for the period to 2010. Most watercourses
within the basin have, since 1977, been designated in the poor quality
classes 3 and 4 and currently serve only to dilute the polluting effect
of incoming waste waters. They are estimated to receive polluting loads
equivalent to a  biochemical oxygen demand of around 160 tonnes/day,
principally from sugar mills and other large industrial plants and a
domestic population of 2.2m.

The Plan envisages raising most of the rivers in this industrialised
area to class 2, drinking water standard, by 2010.

The Sao Paulo state government hopes to provide waste water treatment
for 80% of urban centres in the state by the year 2019. Currently only
5% of the state's waste water receives treatment.

Minas Gerais announces $825.3m, 4 year plan

Legal constraints do not appear to be affecting forward planning in
Minas Gerais where the state water company Copasa, Companhia de
Saneamento de Minas Gerais, has announced an ambitious $825.3m plan for
the period 1996-1999.

The principal element of Copasa's plan is the Prosam project involving
waste water treatment in state capital Belo Horizonte and the
depollution of the city's two main water courses, the Arruda and Onca.
This involves building a comprehensive main drainage system and two
large waste water treatment stations. Amongst other things the plan
envisages provision of 356,000 new water supply connections and 154,000
drain connections. The company hopes to cut drinking water supply
losses, currently the lowest in Brazil at 27%, down to 25%.

PWA CHIEF FACES SECOND INQUIRY OVER CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION

In a second indictment by the government within two months the head of
Thailand's Provincial Waterworks Authority (PWA) is to be investigated
over alleged mismanagement of a major contract.

In this instance the charge concerns late completion of a drinking
water contract. The PWA head, Visit Lorthirapong is said to have failed
to enforce punitive measures against the contractor involved in
installation of the Nong Khae district pumping station in central
Saraburi province. The work was completed 200 days late, incurring a
penalty of $720,000, but no fine was ever collected.

"If found guilty of abusing his authority by the auditor's office, the
PWA governor will face dismissal," said a spokesman for Deputy Interior
Minister Suchart Tancharoen, who ordered the investigation.

This is the second charge against Visit  since the current government
came to power in early July. He already faces investigation for
apparently defying an order by Suchart to delay the signing of a $160-
million contract for the Putham Thani water treatment plant. That
contract went to Thames Water International of the UK and Karnchang, a
Thai construction firm. According to industry reports, Suchart had
favoured a rival syndicate in the bidding. A review of the contract by
the Interior Ministry is nearing completion. Visit has told the inquiry
panel that he signed the contract because it had already been approved
by the former government of Chuan Leekpai.

Two unsuccessful bidders, led by Italian-Thai Development, Thailand's
largest construction group, and industrial estate operator MDX, lodged
official protests against the decision. Italian-Thai is known to have
close ties to Suchart's Chart Thai party, which forms the core of the
governing coalition.

Visit has been suspended since the row broke, and is not expected to
resume his post, even if he is cleared by the two investigations.

REPORT PROVIDES GOOD REFERENCE TO UK WATER COMPANY PERFORMANCE

Business Ratio Plus :Water Companies*   is probably the best collection
of publicly available information on water industry results collated
into one reference book.

The 1995 8th Edition covers the industry in England and Wales. For each
of the 10 regional water service plcs and the 20 or more water supply
companies it provides a range of good hard fact - contact details,
directors' names, turnover by subsidiaries, three full years' balance
sheets and profit and loss details. The core businesses of the 10 plcs
are treated to the same examination.

A reference work of this sort is  out-of-date as soon as it rolls off
the presses, as is the information it includes but, until an on-line
version is produced it's the best we can reasonably expect.

The latest figures relate to the year ending March '95 and the sector
has had interims, various bids and a long hot summer to cope with since
then. Further developments up to the end of the third quarter of 1995
are covered briefly in the Industry Comment section at the back of the
book. The performance analyses and league table positions are detailed
and avoid the need to work them out. The ratios, the meanings of which
are defined, are grouped into six categories; profitability, liquidity,
gearing, efficiency, employee performance and exports/sales. League
positions of the individual companies are ranked in the same way. Thus
at #1.17bn Thames Water plc had the highest turnover as at 31.3.95 and
produced the largest profit, #303.7m. Severn Trent employs 200 more
people than Thames and has the greatest total assets of #3.69bn.

Apart from Wessex Water which has a pre-tax profit margin of 51.1% none
of the Big 10 finds its way into the top five most profitable
companies. Indeed eight of them are below the water supply only
companies average gross margin of 31.6%. Does this prove that small is
beautiful when it comes to water companies? Investors may find this
analysis useful and industry players can keep an eye on what the others
are doing; it all depends on where your interest lies.

Business Ratio Plus :Water Companies  does not go into the unregulated
businesses in any greater detail than to list their turnover. In the
long run this may be where the real differences and investor interest
arise. For that we will need annual reports, latest interims and a lot
more specific company research but as far as it goes this is an
excellent basic handbook to the water industry in England and Wales.

SOUTHERN AND BRISTOL WATER COMPLETE INTERIMS REPORTING SEASON IN UK

Southern Water plc, the last of the big 10 to report at the interim
stage, is showing turnover up to #206.9 million from #190.6 million
last year.

The massive retained profit of #58.7 million, or 28.37% of turnover,
continues a trend. The comparable figure was #86.9 million or 22.59% of
sales for the full year to 31 March and #52.5 million or 27.5% at the
half way stage in 1994. It is not surprising then that Southern intends
to buy back its shares although it might have been more imaginative and
expanded the business rather than shrinking it.

In fact it intends to fund the exercise by increasing the dividend by
year end so that the total cost to the company will be the same as
buying its own shares. Even so by then funds in the share premium
account and reserves look set to exceed #1bn

In addition to "returning value to shareholders" Southern also intends
to defer the permitted 1% price increase for 1996/7 and bring in a
"customer benefit programme" costing #50 million. This will go towards
"discretionary" spending on "distribution, foul water flooding and
odour control."

If Southern can achieve all this in such a drought year, with only a
hose-pipe ban by way of emergency measures, is it charging too much for
its services or investing too little in the infrastructure? Southern
may end up being praised for its prudence but like other suppliers the
1996 outlook may depend on the extent of winter rains.

Bristol Water Holdings plc increased turnover to #33.16 million from
#31.31 million this time last year. Operating profits were up to #8.25
million from #6.54 million in 1994 when they took into account a #1.1
million re-reorganisation provision. This has now fed through to the
bottom line of #4.78 million and retained profit of #3.75 million.

Hopefully this will help ease net borrowings which still run at 68% of
total shareholders' funds. At the full year they had been 91% and at
the interim stage last year 87%.

Meanwhile shareholders' funds have crept up from #43.5 million to #47.7
million since 31st March 1995 year end suggesting a move from debt to
equity financing although without full view of the underlying numbers
this cannot be verified.

Bristol still has large capital projects to fund, particularly the
Gloucester to Sharpness Canal which it estimates will cost #2 million
by the end of the century.

Following restructuring and reduction of the workforce by 15% perhaps
Bristol is set fair for improved results at the full year.

EIB LENDS ECU100M VIA POLISH BANKS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SCHEMES

A credit line of ECU100m advanced by the European Investment Bank to
four foreign banks operating in Poland -  ABN-AMRO, Creditanstalt, ING
Bank, and Raiffeisen-Centrobank - is intended broadly for use on
`infrastructure' projects.

An EIB spokesman told FTWB the intended coverage could range from
installing telephone lines to building tourist facilities, but
environmental projects, including water/wastewater treatment schemes
would certainly qualify. Individual loans could range from ECU20,000 to
ECU 25m. depending on the intermediary bank chosen.

The loans would be relatively cheap, with interest charged at 150 basis
points (1.5%) over Libor (London interbank offered rate), and repayment
over up to 11 years.

The EIB raises market funds as cheaply as anybody, given its AAA rating
as a supranational institution. Furthermore, by lending through foreign
banks, the EIB has been able to obtain guarantees from the foreign
banks' parents in Amsterdam or Vienna, thereby avoiding the
complications of extracting a government guarantee from the Polish
authorities, as would have been needed in the case of a Polish bank. By
lending through one single intermediary, the EIB has kept to a minimum
the number of margins that must be added to the basic cost of the
money.

AMORIM BUYS MAJOR SHARE IN LUSAGUA

The Amorim group, Portugal's biggest cork products group and one of the
country's largest business conglomerates, has acquired 50% of Lusagua,
a water company, previously wholly owned by two Spanish groups, Aguas
de Barcelona and Canal Isabel.

The acquisition, made by increasing Lusagua's capital from Es100m
($150,000) to Es200m, represents an important diversification for the
Amorim group. The two Spanish companies retain the remaining 50%. The
acquisition was made shortly after Lusagua, in association with another
company, Aquagest, was awarded a concession to manage the water supply
and waste water treatment systems of Carvoeiro, the name given to a
group of municipalities centred on Aveiro in northern Portugal.

MINISTERS PLAN INCREASED SPENDING ON WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS

A total of $60 million has been allocated for provincial waste water
treatment plants in Thailand this year (1996), double the 1995
expenditure. Included in an $84-million environmental fund, the money
will be allocated under 1992 legislation that requires provincial
governments to formulate local action plans.

"The funding has been raised substantially because of the heavy
response from provincial administrations. There are at least five
municipalities that will begin waste water treatment plants (in 1996),"
said Saksit Tridej, a senior official in the Environment Ministry.

While the funding comes from the national government, local authorities
must conduct feasibility studies and provide land for the plants. The
system reverses a previous trend of centralised planning from Bangkok.

"It's a very effective method, as the government can allocate budgets
to local agencies to tackle pressing environmental problems," said
Saksit. "They are in a better position to know what is needed that we
are."

Resource studies planned in East and West provinces

Elsewhere the Industry Ministry has called for feasibility studies on
improvement of supplies to factories in the eastern and western
provinces following complaints from manufacturers.

Industry minister Chaiwat Sinsuwong said East Water, a partially
privatised water distributor, would be commissioned to overcome
shortages affecting much of the eastern seaboard, including supplies to
state-run industrial estates.

"The supplies need to be improved but also the pricing. Everyone is
complaining that piped water is too expensive in these two areas," he
said. "What may be needed is better resource management."

Efforts to boost supplies have been thwarted by a shortage of suitable
sites for reservoirs; the government is considering importing water
from Cambodia if new domestic sources cannot be found.

FRENCH GROUPS COMBINE IN BID FOR CONTROL OF MID-KENT WATER

Generale des Eaux's British subsidiary General Utilities, and its
Bouygues Group counterpart Saur Water Services have announced that they
intend to launch a takeover bid for the UK`s Mid Kent Water.

The French have indicated an offer of #4.40 a share, valuing Mid Kent
at some #80m ($126m). But the bid will have to await the approval of
the UK's Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This is not likely to be a
stumbling block, given the recent approval of the much more significant
bid by Lyonnaise des Eaux for the regional water and sewage utility,
Northumbrian Water. One difficulty might arise however from the advice
of the Mid-Kent board that shareholders should reject the bid.

The two French-owned companies already hold 39% of Mid Kent, but would
like control.  General Utilities already owns Folkestone and Dover
Water which serves the area adjacent to Mid-Kent on the east side,
while Saur Water Services controls South East Water to  the west of Mid-
Kent.

Generale and Saur say a takeover would optimise water usage in the area
and thereby reduce the risk of water shortages.

South East Water is the largest of the three companies with 618,000
clients and an annual turnover of #50.9m. Mid Kent serves  525,000
users and Folkestone and Dover, annual turnover #10.4m, serves
151,000.

In all, General Utilities provides water for 3.1m persons in the UK via
four companies, while Saur Water Services provides for 1.3m persons via
two companies.

UWR TO PARTNER JERSEY CITY FOR WATER SYSTEM OPERATION

United Water Resources (UWR), America's second largest investor-owned
water services company, on 11 December won the contract to manage the
water system of Jersey city, an industrial community across the Hudson
River from the tip of Manhattan Island. Population to be served is
about 240,000.

The contract is subject to public hearings and approval of the New
Jersey state public utility. UWR anticipates a successful outcome of
the approval process and is scheduling a start this Spring. It will be
the largest public-private partnership for a municipal water operation
in the country.

The company says the proposal will bring major economic benefits to
Jersey City over five years through operating efficiencies, improved
billing, job creation, plus the purchase of Jersey City's excess water
supplies.

UWR is a holding company whose subsidiaries engage in water-related
businesses, real estate, and environmental testing. It provides water
and wastewater services to about two million people in 13 states.

WORLD BANK TO FUND $13.5M STUDY FOR REGION'S LARGEST DAM

The World Bank has agreed to fund the second stage of a feasibility
study for the Son La hydro-electric dam in Vietnam, which will be the
largest to be constructed in Southeast Asia.

Bradley Babson, spokesman for the Bank's mission in Hanoi, said the
involvement was conditional upon Vietnam using a recognised level of
design and construction and protecting ethnic minorities who live in
the area. "We are not financing the dam, but we may provide funds to
make sure that they do the studies for the dam in a way that will fit
international standards," he said. Expected to take two years, the
$13.5m study will look at the environmental impact and social
repercussions from the relocation of thousands of local residents.

An earlier study by Sweden's Sweco consultancy found that the project
was economically viable, and recommended two sites on the Black River,
a tributary of the Red River in northern Hanoi.

Expected to have an electricity output of up to 3,794 megawatts, the
project will be twice the size of Hoa Binh dam, 190 kilometres
downstream, which is currently the largest in the region.

Meanwhile, construction of a $110-million hydro-power plant has started
at Song Hinh in central Phu Yen province. Work on a series of dams with
a power output of 370 million kilowatt hours began in 1991.
