<H3>AOL - ABOUT THE MEMBER DIRECTORY</H3>
<BR>
The Member Directory allows you to find out more about your fellow members
and to search for people that share your interests. You will be able to
search the directory by the member's full profile. The profile contains
personal information (screen name, real name, location), occupation, hobbies
and interests and more. You can also add your own profile to the Member
Directory. All information is optional. You can include just your screen
name and city or you can include sex, marital status, personal quote, etc.
You can change your profile at any time from the directory. <BR>
