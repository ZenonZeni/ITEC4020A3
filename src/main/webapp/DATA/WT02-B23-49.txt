<H1>Rare, violent tornadic waterspout<BR>
strikes the Pamlico Sound</H1> Spin-up mechanisms rather than mesocyclones may prove to be their defining characteristic</CENTER>
<P>
On Monday afternoon, July 11, 1994, Arthur Duke, a news reporter and cameraman for WCTI TV of New Bern, North Carolina, was aboard a 20-foot outboard powered boat on the four-mile wide expanse of the nearby Neuse River where it opens onto the Pamlico Sound. <P>
"I was with Rick Dove who runs the River Keeper, a pollution patrol boat sponsored by the Neuse River Foundation, looking for evidence of a reported fish kill," Duke recalls. "It was a hot sultry day with few clouds and no wind. The water was flat calm with the temperature in the 80s. But the air was very thick, like the sky was going to drop at any minute.  In the distance we could see clouds coming together. They seemed to be forming a line right over the river." <P>
Nearing the river's tree-lined south shore a few miles from Cherry Point just after 4 p.m., Duke was up forward scanning the water for signs of dead fish when behind him Dove,  standing at  the steering console,  cried "Oh, my god!"<P>

"I turned around and saw the biggest thing I've ever seen in my life, just huge, looking exactly like a tornado, no more than half a mile away from us as we looked east down the sound.  We both froze. The thing was shooting up into the sky,  a giant swirling motion.  You could see the water spinning in the center. We figured it had to be three hundred feet wide, the length of a football field. "<P>
	"Tornado!" Rick yelled. I grabbed my  video camera and said 'Let me get a couple of shots.'" He said "Do it fast! That thing is heading right towards us!"  As I filmed I noticed in the distance another boat much closer to the funnel and it was making a run for it. I  shot a little less than a minute of tape before I put the camera down and Rick started to move out. He's been on the water for 30 years,  a very experienced boater - and he was very nervous. He said "That's the biggest one I've ever seen. It'll tear the boat apart!" <P>
	With nowhere to dock or safely tie up on the river's tree-lined south bank, Dove gunned his boat out into the river, heading at full throttle for the north shore and the harbor at Fairfield. Moments of terror followed: <P>
	"It appeared to be coming after us. Suddenly dark clouds formed and it started raining violently, a torrential rain. And high wind and tremendous thunder. We could see lightening coming from the clouds striking the funnel. Then we lost sight of it in the rain. My first thought was the tornado was moving much faster than us,  sucking us towards it." <P>
	Duke had the presence of mind to reach for his cell phone and call his news director at the station: "Over the noise I yelled 'We're on the river, there's a huge tornado moving towards us, and we're hauling ass!" She said she was praying for us.  They called the Coast Guard, the Marines at nearby Cherry Point, everyone." <P>

	At that moment in nearby Minnesott Beach, Garvin Hardison was sitting at his desk in his office at Hardison Realty, right on the bank of the Neuse River where he has lived for 60 years. <P>
	"I happened to look out the window and saw a huge tornado on the river less than a mile away. I thought it was coming towards me.  I was damn scared. Then in a heartbeat a terribly violent storm hit.  I rushed out of my office and was getting in my truck to escape when my son met me and said not to worry, that he had just got off the ferry from the south side and the thing was heading towards Cherry Point across from us. I managed to get a Polaroid picture of the spout but by the time I did it was already getting smaller." <P>
	Out on the water in the blinding rain and choppy water, Rick Dove neared shore, running over crab pot floats as he approached the Fairfield Harbor, hoping that the prop would not become fouled in the lines.  It didn't and the pair arrived safely at dockside. So did the boat Duke had seen moments earlier near the funnel.  That vessel had been carrying 20 children staying at the Minnesott Beach YMCA camp. Reporter Duke hitched a ride to New Bern and arrived on the set dripping wet to deliver a live report on the five o'clock news as the raw video footage was aired. "My life had flashed before my eyes," he later confessed. "But the story comes first." <P>
<CENTER><B>As powerful as the Dinner Key event</B></CENTER><P>
	According to witnesses aboard a state ferry that runs between Cherry Point and Minnesot Beach, the spout lasted about 20 minutes, from 4:05 to 4:25 p.m. Crew members estimated the funnel's height at 2,500-3,000 feet. Strangely, there appeared to be no evidence of circulation at the cloud base (as happens with tornadoes). "The power that thing had to have was unreal," reported crew member Harold Thomas.  "It was just awesome."  In the immediate aftermath he Coast Guard conducted a search for a 25-foot sailboat feared capsized by the funnel cloud but the boat's captain later called to report he was safe. All told, except for some minor property damage caused by high winds, the spout had caused no damage or casualties. <P>
	The citizens of the Neuse River were lucky.  In the aftermath, interviews of witnesses and photogrammetric analysis of Duke's video, as well as photographs taken by others, strongly suggest the Cherry Point waterspout resembled the infamous Florida waterspout that in 1968 ravaged Dinner Key on the outskirts of Miami, causing injuries and property damage in the many thousands. <P>
	"The Cherry Point waterspout was very much on par with the Dinner Key event," concludes Joseph Golden, director of NOAA's Atmospheric Modification Program, after analyzing the data. "Its visual appearance suggests if it had come on shore it would have been equally, or more, destructive than the Dinner Key event." <P>
	Dr. Golden,  a world authority on waterspouts who has devoted a career to the study of vortical storms, obtained several stills taken by a witness that clearly reveal a double wall structure to the Cherry Point funnel. "My experience in the Florida Keys suggest that when you have that structure, the waterspout is most intense and most destructive. You actually have a double wind maximum when you have a double funnel. But such events are rare in the Keys - rare everywhere. But when that happens such spouts are exceptionally dangerous." <P>
	What intrigues Dr. Golden is that the Cherry Point waterspout, like the one at Dinner Key - and a third funnel he witnessed on Matecumbe Key in September, 1967 - did not appear to be spawned by conditions on the water, a defining characteristic of classic waterspout formation (see side bar). <P>
	"Common waterspouts, because of the nature of the environment in which they form and the structure of their parent clouds, tend to weaken when they come on shore. Whereas the Dinner Key and Matecumbe Key tornadic spouts maintained great intensity when they moved from water to land, and, as happened at Dinner Key,  from land to water." <P>
	So what were they? In simplest terms, Golden suggests they  were tornadoes at sea, yet, as  with the Cherry Point waterspout, both were highly unusual, a hybrid of a classic Midwest tornado and a large waterspout, and as such deserving of a separate niche in the tornadic hierarchy. <P>
	Golden believes that with this type of tornadic water waterspout, the character of the underlying boundary - land or water -  appears to be of least importance in determining whether or not one of these vortices is going to form. "What's of fundamental importance is that you have an environment conducive to the formation and growth of a very strong convective cloud line. Typically, cloud lines that produce tornadic waterspouts have tops twenty-five to thirty-thousand feet and are growing explosively. In contrast, cloud tops  over waterspouts in the Keys are initially only fifteen to twenty thousand feet." <P>
<CENTER><B>Synoptic scale analysis</B></CENTER><P>
	To help determine if such conditions existed the day of the Cherry Point incident, Golden contacted  meteorologist Carin Goodall-Gosnell of the National Weather Service's office in Newport, N.C., only 15 miles away from the waterspout's location. The two conducted a thorough synoptic analysis of mesoscale conditions (phenomenon on the order of a few kilometers to a few hundred kilometers),  studied surface frontal positions, temperatures, dew points, winds, GOES 7 Satellite imagery, and data provided by the recently installed, state-of-the-art WSR-88D  NEXRAD Doppler Radar data (see side bar). <P>
	They found that on the afternoon  of July 11th there were present several distinct microscale boundaries, two of which intersected directly above the Neuse River near Cherry Point, North Carolina (this distinctive cloud line was probably what TV reporter Art Duke observed just prior to the waterspout's appearance).  Further, there appeared to be enhanced low level convergence between the two boundaries, a factor that Golden's previous research showed plays a key role in waterspout formation. <P>
	Only limited velocity data during the event was archived on the WSR-88D, but what interested Golden was the absence of any mesocyclone or velocity couplets in the lowest 1.5 degree elevation scan immediately prior to, or during, the waterspout's 20 minute life cycle.  While he could not rule out the possibility that parent  <IMG ALIGN="LEFT" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5" SRC="spout.gif" ALT="[waterspout photo]">circulation may have existed at a higher altitude than the 88D scanned, indications were that the kind of mesocyclone associated with the formation of classic Midwest tornadoes was absent.<BR>

	So what caused the Cherry Point tornadic waterspout? <P>
	"We think the low level convergence of those two well-defined boundaries over the Neuse River that afternoon provided the spin-up mechanism that spawned that waterspout," Golden explains. He adds that follow-up research on mesoscale environments and parent cloud structure will be conducted at the North Carolina office during the next two years to develop pattern recognition schemes to help forecast waterspouts. <P>
<B><CENTER><FONT SIZE="4">"I witnessed some shocking stupidity by mariners out there in recreational power boats and yachts."</FONT></CENTER></B>
	Adding credence to Golden's hypothesis are data being developed by Project Vortex in Oklahoma. The largest tornado field project ever attempted, the $3.5 million effort (funded by NOAA and the National Science Foundation), is making extensive use of NEXRAD-developed information. Surprisingly, a  number of tornadoes have been recorded showing no detectable mesocyclone associated with their formation. "It now appears that some tornadoes spin up from the ground, which is what I think is the primary process for most waterspouts," Golden says. <P>
	Similarly, in recent years storm chasers on the plains in the Midwest have been documenting the frequent (and seldom reported) appearance  of weak tornadoes  that greatly resemble Florida Keys waterspouts, so much so that they have been dubbed landspouts.  For his part, Golden is uncomfortable with  the term because he feels it may give the public a false sense of security. <P>
	"Your chances of getting hit by one are very low because the vortex is so small, but you could die if you get hit. And if your house is hit, damage could be severe. Their wind speed range is generally F-zero to F-one  [75mph-100 mph] on the one-to-five scale." <P>
	The same precautions apply for waterspouts. "I can't stress enough that all waterspouts are potentially lethal at certain times in their life cycle. And the bigger they are, the more dangerous." <P>
<CENTER><B>Mariners' important role</B></CENTER><P>
	In August, 1993, Golden served as chief scientist and movie camera operator in a week-long field program conducted by NOAA and the National Geographic Society, using a helicopter and a chase plane to film the most detailed movies ever taken of waterspouts. "We found and filmed over a dozen waterspouts and I witnessed some shocking stupidity by mariners out there in recreational power boats and yachts. Once we watched and filmed in horror as one guy in a power boat chased a waterspout and intercepted the spray vortex, fortunately as it was weakening. The meteorologist-in-charge at the Key West weather service office told us that this happens all the time and that people have gotten into trouble but they don't want the authorities to know about it, probably  for insurance reasons." <P>
	Waterspout footage from Golden's remarkable field observations will be aired on NBC in the fall as part of a National Geographic Special titled "Cyclones" and which will include  segments on Hurricane Andrew and tornado chasing in the Midwest. <P>
	Golden maintains that mariners, particularly in the Keys, can serve an important role as volunteer spotters, especially now that so many have cell phones on board. They should never assume that no one cares when a funnel cloud appears, and that there's nothing to worry about if the funnel doesn't extend down to the water. <P>
	"It's true that less than half the funnels ever reach the spray vortex stage, but don't assume it has to touch the water. In my experience whenever a visible funnel extends downward more than forty to fifty percent of the way, you have a complete and mature and potentially life threatening waterspout in progress. A significant portion of that column may not be visible, and the wind speed in the spray vortex at the sea surface - where the greatest danger to mariners exists - can easily be fifty-to one hundred knots or more." <P>
	Not surprisingly, the core speeds of the larger tornadic waterspouts are much higher. The most intense one Golden has documented had a maximum velocity in the spray vortex of 88 meters per second, or over 200 mph - "and it was an anticyclonic vortex." Field research indicates that about one in every ten waterspouts rotate anticyclonically, depending on the direction of the causative wind currents. <P>
	Despite this and other discoveries about waterspouts and their tornadic half-breed relatives, mysteries remain, not only about the mechanics of their formation, but about vortex structure and its radial-vertical motion.  Doubtless Golden and his associates who study tornadogenesis,  aided by  the WSR-88D and other tools using breakthrough technologies, will learn much more in the years ahead. In the meantime, mariners out on the water would be well-advised to give these fascinating phenomena a wide and respectful berth. <P>
