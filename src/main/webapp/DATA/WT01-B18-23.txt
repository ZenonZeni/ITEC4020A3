<P>
<I><B>Development of low pollution feeds</B></I>: This research
seeks to optimize feed formulations to reduce waste products produced
by the culture animal. 
<P>
1) <I>Development of nutrient dense diets</I>: This research has
concentrated on evaluating the effects of dietary manipulations
on growth and nutrient retention of red drum as well as changes
in water quality parameters in closed systems. Additionally, the
effects of medium chain triglycerides on growth and body composition
are being evaluated as a mechanism to reduce fat stores in cultured
fish.
<P>

<P>
<B>Comparative Anatomical and Functional Development of Sensory
Systems in Three Sciaenid Fishes</B>: Kirsten Poling is documenting
the developmental changes in the end-organs of visual and mechanosensory
systems of red drum, spotted seatrout, and Atlantic croaker. She
is measuring developmental changes in the performance of these
systems in order to understand the relationship of form to function.
She will use all of this information to draw some conclusions
about the role of sensory system development in ontogenetic niche
shifts of the three species.
<P>
<B>Biomarkers of Larval Fitness in Croaker Exposed to Pesticides</B>:
This is Team Fuiman's portion of a joint project with Peter Thomas'
lab. Cindy Faulk is using a collection of behavioral assays to
determine whether parental exposure to a model pesticide (DDT)
has ecologically significant sublethal effects on the larvae they
produce. The assays measure burst and routine swimming as well
as the performance of the visual and auditory systems.
<P>
<B>Presence, Ontogeny, and Function of Two Types of Neuromasts
in the Lateral Line System of Red Drum</B>: This collaboration
with Jiakun Song (University of Maryland and Smithsonian Institution)
is based on the recent discovery that aminoglycoside antibiotics
damage lateral line canal neuromasts but not superficial neuromasts.
Our work on larval red drum addresses questions on the development
and differential function of these potentially very different
sensory endorgans.
<P>
<B>Predation Mortality of Larval Fishes: Peril of the Unfit or
the Unfortunate?</B>: This collaboration with Jim Cowan (Dauphin
Island Sea Lab, Alabama) is examining the question of whether
predation mortality during early life is the result of chance
encounters with predators or the predator evasion skills of the
larvae. Laboratory assays measure survival skills of individual
larvae to determine whether some individuals excel in several
skills (born athletes). Laboratory results will be incorporated
into an individual-based model and simulations will be performed
to predict the survival of athletes and non-athletes. These predictions
will then be tested in mesocosm trials.
<P>
<B>Physical and Physiological Effects of Temperature on Larval
Fish Swimming</B>: This collaboration with Bob Batty (Dunstaffnage
Marine Laboratory, Scotland) is measuring the importance of natural
variations in water viscosity to the swimming performance and
kinematics of Atlantic herring larvae. Both routine (slow, aerobic)
and burst (fast, anaerobic) swimming modes are being studied.
<P>
<B>Effects of Temperature and Salinity on the Interaction between
Red Drum Larvae and a Piscine Predator</B>: Locomotor and physiological
performance of both predator and prey may be influenced by differences
in temperature and salinity, but the magnitude of the effects
may differ for larvae and larger fishes. This project examines
the responsiveness and response effectiveness of red drum larvae,
and the capture success of larger pinfish under 12 combinations
of temperature and salinity to determine relative importance of
these two natural environmental variables to the predatory-prey
interaction.

<P>
Larviculture and high density grow-out studies of marine species
in closed systems aimed at developing a mariculture approach to
the conservation of natural resources.
<P>
1. Mariculture development throughout the world is hampered by
the lack of reliable rearing systems and practical diets for the
larvae. For example, high yields of red drum depend upon feeding
the larvae live prey for one to several weeks. In order to reduce
the requirement for live prey, feeding and nutrition studies here
are focused on understanding the <B>developing digestive system
and nutrient requirements for larval sciaenids</B>. The goal is
to determine essential nutrients for larvae and the best means
for supplying those nutrients.
<P>
2. <B>Role of microbial ecology in larval fish culture and nutrition</B>
has been investigated by Philippe Douillet. Initially the study
aimed to develop a scheme for managing the composition of the
microbial community in intensive, closed culture for red drum
larvae. The second phase was to identify and culture beneficial
microbes to add to the larva cultures. Currently we are exploring
the possibility of using enzyme producing gut- bacteria to enhance
the utilization of artificial diets.
<P>
3. <B>Culture of tropical reef fish and shrimp</B> would function
to conserve natural reef resources by offering alternatives to
wild capture. Over the past we have successfully spawned seven
reef species and reared the larvae of three: cubbyu (<I>Equetus
umbrosus</I>), yellow-tail snapper (<I>Ocyurus chrysurus</I>)
and a cleaner shrimp (<I>Lysmata wurdemanni</I>). Using the techniques
we developed for rearing the larvae, together with micro-zooplankton
culture it is possible that many coral reef species can be grown
in culture.
<P>
<B>Biochemical measures of fish growth and condition</B> to evaluate
the condition or growth potential of lab cultured or natural populations
of fish larvae.
<P>
1. Several biochemical measures are under investigation including
<I><B>RNA-DNA ratio, lipids, and MPF (Mitosis Promoting Factor)</B></I>.
The RNA-DNA ratio has been examined in larvae raised in the laboratory
under various feeding, salinity and temperature conditions, and
in natural population of red drum. The measure is a good indicator
of recent history of feeding and perhaps temperature conditions.
Studies by Claire Fernandez and others are investigating further
the effect of temperature history on the RNA-DNA ratio.
<P>
2. In a collaborative project with Mark Westerman, the usefulness
of <I><B>cyclin-dependent kinase activity</B></I>, predominantly
Mitosis Promoting Factor, in assessing how biological and environmental
inputs affect growth of teleost larvae is being investigated.
Classes of lipids (<I>ie..</I> tags, steroles, etc.)<I> </I>vary
depending on the nutritional state of larvae; this will be examined
when we get access to an Iatroscan possibly later this year (automated
thin layer chromatograph with a flame ionization detector). Both
methods will be compared to the RNA-DNA ratio in larvae with different
growth histories. 
<P>
Larval fish studies to determine the <B>role of biological and
physical factors in growth and survival of natural populations</B>
of estuarine dependent fishes.
<P>
1. Overall the salinity tolerance of spotted seatrout is broad
but we have shown that early life stages have reduced tolerance
with 3 day old larvae being the most sensitive. Egg size varies
inversely with salinity in natural spawning populations and the
range of tolerance in pre-feeding larvae is directly related to
spawning salinity. Furthermore changing the salinity on adults
brought into the lab during the spawning season has detrimental
effects on the development of eggs and larvae. Possible hypotheses
to explain the data we have accumulated thus far are (1) long-term
acclimation by adults to salinity regulates the pattern of salinity
tolerance found in young larvae, (2) non-genetic, possible irreversible
adaptation of the embryo or larva regulates salinity tolerance
at the population level, or (3) stocks or populations of spotted
seatrout are genetically adapted to the prevailing salinity regime
of a bay system.
<P>
2. In a collaborative study with S. Holt we are trying to identify
<I><B>critical periods during the transport of red drum and other
sciaenids</B></I> from spawning sites to estuarine nursery grounds.
The role of physical factors and vertical positioning on transport
of eggs and larvae through the Aransas Pass has been examined
in several studies. We found that larval sciaenids could use modified
tidal stream transport to reach estuarine nursery areas, by staying
in near- bottom water in the pass on ebb tide and moving up on
flood tide. Vertical movement was not associated with feeding
since larvae feed only during daylight hours and flood and ebb
cycles do not follow a strict diurnal pattern. The objectives
of an ongoing study are to determine the temporal pattern of spawning,
estimate density of larvae, and determine birthdate distribution
of young fish that successfully recruit to the sea grass beds
with the goal of quantifying physical and biological conditions
that result in high survival.
<P>
3. Studies by Jay Rooker and Andy Soto are examining <I><B>how
feeding, growth and condition of larvae in the sea grass beds
are affected by habitat and competition</B></I>. They will present
their research at a brown bag seminar in the near future.

<P>
The central theme of research in Scott Holt's lab is fish ecology,
with emphasis on larval and juvenile life history stages. Virtually
all the studies are field oriented and are comparative, using
&quot;natural&quot; experiments, rather than manipulative.
<P>
Recent projects include:
<P>
<B>Studies of the temporal and spatial distribution of fish larvae</B>
in the Laguna Madre and the <B>impact of the brown tide</B> on
those larvae. We have seen a dramatic decline in the density of
all early-stage fish larvae (incl. spotted seatrout and black
drum) in areas of high brown tide concentrations. Joan has lab
data showing high mortality of eggs and nonfeeding larvae and
reductions in feeding success of older larvae. Our field data
reflect those impacts. 
<P>
<B>Studies of the utilization of different seagrass habitats by
larvae</B> in the Laguna Madre. Jim Tolan recently completed a
MS at TAMUCC looking at the occurrence of fish larvae and early
juveniles in <I>Halodule</I>, <I>Syringodium</I> and adjacent
bare bottom in the lower Laguna Madre. He found that highest densities
of juveniles of most species was in <I>Halodule</I> with little
difference between <I>Syringodium</I> and bare bottom. Early larval
stages were found in all habitats but specific distributions varied
by species. In general, early larvae of species which spawn in
the open bay or inshore Gulf, (ie. spotted seatrout and red drum)
were found primarily over unvegetated habitat whereas those species
which spawn in structured habitat, especially those with demersal
eggs (i.e., gobies and silversides), were more common over seagrasses.
<P>
The primary focus of the rest of our research over the past 6-8
years has been the <B>migration of fish larvae from offshore spawning
grounds to estuarine nursery areas</B> with emphasis on transport
processes involved in ingress through the tidal inlet. Our focus
has been on red drum but we have accumulated similar data for
all other sciaenids in the collections and a few other species
as well. Much of this research has been done in cooperation with
Joan Holt and several of her students. 
<P>
We have looked at the temporal and spatial (both horizontal and
vertical) distribution of larvae over several tidal cycles and
found them most abundant in offshore water, as it pulses in and
out of the estuary with each tidal cycle. Densities in estuarine
water are only 10-20% of those in offshore water and those larvae
are generally of the largest size classes we see in the plankton.
The larvae change their vertical position in the water column
such that they are concentrated near then bottom during the day
and on ebb tide (especially those in estuarine water), and throughout
(we think) the water column during the night and on flood tide.
Flood tides are generally at night during red drum spawning time,
complicating the tidal/diel migration pattern. Larvae also appear
to be concentrated at the boundary of the tidal front separating
estuarine water from offshore water.
<P>
We examined the daily ingress of red drum larvae (and other sciaenids
occurring in the same samples) over the entire spawning season.
We found that the temporal occurrence of larvae was highly pulsed,
with much higher densities of larvae occurring in 2-3 day pulses
which were seen every 10-15 days over the immigration period.
Preliminary analysis indicates that the pulses were correlated
with wind events. Larvae of most other sciaenids occurring at
the same time also showed the same pulsed occurrence, further
strengthening the implication of physical control of the distribution
pattern. Chris Drescher looked at RNA/DNA in these larvae for
her thesis work (details are given in Joan Holt's section)
<P>
These studies of larval immigration have extended to the nursery
areas where we are looking at post-settlement processes. We have
examined the spatial and temporal distribution of newly settled
red drum larvae throughout the potential nursery area. The larvae
were occasionally found in all sites examined but were much more
abundant and persistent in some sites than others. We suspect
the differences are driven largely by hydrodynamic processes and
that issue is ripe for future research. Jay Rooker has looked
at differences in condition and growth rates among sites and between
seagrass habitats. Red drum larvae and early juveniles are much
more abundant in Halodule than Thalassia seagrass but condition
was not different between those habitats. Andy Soto is looking
at food habitats of red drum and Atlantic croaker in those habitats.
We are currently determining mortality rates of red drum larvae
and early juveniles in those habitats but are still working on
the data. A study of predation rates in both habitats in the works.
<P>
In almost all of these studies we have used the analysis of otolith
microstructure (ie growth rings) in some way. Our lab is set up
to determine both annual age in adults and daily age of larvae.
The primary information obtained is age of the individual fish
which provides an estimate of overall growth rate and the hatch
date of each larva. Jay Rooker has also used the width of the
outer most rings to determine recent growth for comparison of
habitats effects. We previously looked at pinfish growth rates
between <I>Halodule</I> and <I>Syringodium</I> habitats in the
Laguna (using overall growth rates) and found no difference in
growth. Otolith analysis is also being used to determine growth
rates of adult black drum in the Laguna Madre.
<P>
Another line of research we are developing, but which has not
yet culminated in a funded project, is the study of <B>sounds
made by spawning adult fishes</B>, primarily sciaenids. We have
the hydrophone and sound analysis software and have recorded spawning
activity of several species. Interaction wit other worked in this
field is encouraging and hopefully leading to funded research.

<P>
<B>Demonstration of a progestin (20-beta-S) receptor on sperm
membranes</B> and its characterization in testes is one of the
hot (cool!) projects in Thomas' lab. 20-beta-S is the maturation
inducing steroid in sciaenids which has been shown to be involved
in final oocyte maturation in Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout.
Regulation of the membrane receptor in testes and sperm membrane
preparations is being investigated. Search is on to find a physiological
function of the membrane receptor in the testis and on sperms.
<P>
Charles Detweiler is currently working on <B>hormonal regulation
of sperm motility</B> in Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout. He is also
investigating possible involvement of calcium channels in sperm motility 
in croaker.
<P>
Todd Sperry has <B>characterized androgen receptors in the brain
and ovary</B> of croaker. The ovarian androgen receptor(s) has
different characteristics from those of the brain androgen receptor.
Once these initial characterizations are completed we will begin
to attempt to understand the physiological roles of multiple androgen
receptors in Atlantic croaker.
<P>
Karen Rogowski's project involves examining <B>the role of prolactin
and growth hormone in osmoregulation and reproduction</B> of red
drum and croaker. Her work includes isolation and purification
of the two hormones from pituitary glands, raising of the antibodies
to these hormones, and development and validation of radioimmunoassays
for the measurement of these hormones.
<P>
One of Yong Zhu's project is to determine <B>physiological function(s)
of somatolactin</B>, a recently discovered hormone in fish. Somatolactin
appears to be involved in adaptation of the fish to background
and illuminations. A collaborative project with Prof. Katsumi
Aida's group at the Tokyo University, is underway to construct
red drum somatolactin cDNA library and to develop molecular probes
for future studies on somatolactin gene expression. In addition,
he is working on the purification of 20-beta-<A NAME="start">S
membrane receptor from seatrout ovaries.</A>
<P>
Izhar Khan is involved in the projects on multifactorial <B>neuroendocrine 
control of gonadotropin secretion</B> in Atlantic croaker.  Role of the 
monoamine and amino acid neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and gonadal 
steroids in the control of gonadotropin release from the pituitary is 
being investigated.  Collaborative work with Prof. Yonathan Zohar's group 
at the Center of Marine Biotechnology, University of Maryland, Baltimore 
is in progress to develop molecular probes for the localization and 
quantification of gonadotropin-releasing hormone mRNAs in croaker brain.  
Development of a comprehensive marine fish model of neuroendocrine 
control of gonadotropin release provides the basic framework for our 
<B>neuroendocrine toxicology program</B>.
<P>
Beth Hawkins has cloned and sequenced the <B>estrogen and progesterone
receptor genes</B>. She has developed molecular probes to localize
and quantify estrogen receptor mRNA by in situ hybridization.
These molecular tools will help us understand the GnRH and estrogen
receptor function in discrete brain areas that are involved in
the control of reproduction in croaker.
<P>
<B>Interactions of environmental chemicals with the 20-beta-S
membrane receptor</B>. A variety of chemicals have been shown
to bind to the membrane receptor. Attempts are being made to purify
this receptor. A series of in vitro and in vivo experiments are
planned to test whether the binding of the chemicals to this receptor
can alter normal receptor functions including final oocyte maturation,
ovulation and spawning success.
<P>
Investigation of life history stages of croaker susceptible <B>to
environmental endocrine disruptors</B>. This project proposes
to study the mechanisms of reproductive impairment by a variety
of chemicals including xenoestrogens and heavy metals during different
stages of gonadal cycle as well as teratogenic effects of the
chemicals due to parental exposure.
<P>
Another major project in reproductive toxicology is on the <B>interactions
of xenoestrogens with androgen and other steroid receptors</B>
using croaker as a model species.
