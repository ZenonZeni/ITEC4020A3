<p>	The MARCAV regional consortium joined DARPA in July, 1995 to aid the United States in advancing electric and hybrid-electric drive systems and technologies.</p>


<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-6b.html"><img border=0 align=right src="/image/arpas96-6a.gif"></a><center><b>The hybrid-electric HMMWV, operating in a battery-only mode, eliminates fuel fumes and motor noise, making it difficult for enemy detection.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>

<p>	The MARCAV consortium is operated by Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), an independent nonprofit organization in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. MARCAV develops, demonstrates, and deploys advanced transportation technologies nationwide to improve environmental air quality, increase energy security, rejuvenate the U.S. civil-military industrial base, and increase vehicle performance, particularly for the defense industry.</p>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>MARCAV Mission</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	The mission of MARCAV is to pursue research and development technology that will:</p>
<ul>
<p><li> Develop advanced vehicles and components that approach competitiveness with conventional internal combustion engines, on both cost and performance;</p>
<p><li> Demonstrate that clean vehicles can be produced which are attractive to the commercial and military markets; and</p>
<p><li> Provide a mechanism so that innovative technology and entrepreneurial businesses can be developed alone or in partnership with other U.S. industry, leading to the enhancement of the U.S. civil-military industrial base.</p>

</ul>

<p><h3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Developments for Future Defense and Commercial Applications</FONT></h3></p>

<p>	MARCAV's focus on the civil-military industry is illustrated through its many projects. Examples of projects making great progress include the Hybrid Electric High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), the Utility Electric Vehicle and the Hybrid Electric Bradley Fighting Vehicle.</p>

<p>	The HMMWV, supported by CTC, focuses on converting a conventional HMMWV to hybrid electric power. In other words, the components of the internal combustion engine will be replaced by a smaller diesel motor-generator set in series with dual electric motors. The energy needed for mobility will then be provided through advanced lead-acid batteries. This will minimize the use of imported oil which, in turn, helps the environment, our national security, and our trade deficit. In addition, the Hybrid Electric HMMWV will be capable of operating in a battery-only mode, giving it the ability to move undetected on the battlefield Ñ a huge advantage for U.S. defense operations.</p>

<p>	The Utility Electric Vehicle project, supported by the Keystone Consortium, focuses on demonstrating the feasibility of an all electric, all composite vehicle designed for commercial on-the-road use. This vehicle's low-weight composite structure will enable the vehicle to travel at speeds up to 70 mph. The Utility Electric Vehicle was recently honored at the Composite Fabricators Association Convention with the 1995 Technical Innovation Award, while placing third overall at this international show.</p>

<p><blockquote><a href="/reference/image/arpas96-6d.html"><img border=0 align=left src="/image/arpas96-6c.gif"></a><center><b>Twenty-three of the utility electric vehicles are to be produced within the next three years, using three for crash tests and 20 for road tests.</b></center></blockquote><br clear=all><br></p>

<p>	The Hybrid Electric Bradley Fighting Vehicle project, supported by United Defense, L.P., focuses on converting a standard Bradley Fighting Vehicle to a hybrid electric drive. The objective of this conversion is to demonstrate the automotive and operational advantages of a hybrid electric drive for tracked combat vehicles. The Hybrid Electric vehicle will be enabled by high power density electric drive components developed for heavy-duty applications Ñ a necessity for such combat vehicles.</p>

<p>	MARCAV's developments do not stop here. MARCAV is working on a number of other projects to help improve and upgrade the design, development, and manufacture of defense and commercial electric and hybrid electric vehicles. These include the Hybrid Electric M113 Demonstrator, High Capacity Hydrogen Storage Demonstrators, Fixed Speed Ratio Transmission, Polymer Multi-Layer Capacitors and Batteries, and the implementation of Integrated Product and Process Design (IPPD) throughout the consortia. The newest member to MARCAV's family of projects is the Flywheel Energy Storage System project, focusing on the development of secure flywheel containment units.</p>

<p>	MARCAV's progress on its electric and hybrid-electric vehicle projects is sure to be consistent and abundant. MARCAV looks forward to continued opportunities with the other DARPA consortia and in the defense market.</p>
