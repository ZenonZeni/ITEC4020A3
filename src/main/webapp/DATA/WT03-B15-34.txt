<P>Jerry Mc Fadden has been on Death Row in Huntsville Prison, Texas, since 1987, for a murder Amnesty International feels he may be innnocent of. Jerry is half Irish and half Cherokee Indian. His father was from Donegal, and it is partially because of his Irish roots that the AI Irish Section made the decision to campaign on his behalf, though the main reason is that there is so much evidence to suggest his innocence.

<P>Suzanne Harrison was brutally murdered on the evening of May 4th, 1986. Two days later Jerry was arrested. Jerry's conviction was obtained on flawed and scant circumstantial evidence and the dubious testimony of a so-called 'prison witness', to the effect that Jerry had confessed to him. The trial records show that prison employees testified that the alleged contact between Jerry and the witness could not have been possible - due to their housing locations and single recreation status. 

<P>Jerry was due to be executed last year, but received a stay of execution three days before he was due to be put to death. Amnesty International has recently received news that Jerry is likely to have a new execution date set within the next couple of months. Since 1900 there have been 28 prisoners executed in the USA who were later found to have been innocent. Could Jerry become yet another sad statistic?

<P>This is why we need to make people aware of Jerry's case and why Amnesty International is now campaigning on his behalf. Amnesty International believes that the Death Penalty is WRONG in all cases, but is even more so when there is a strong likelihood that the inmate to be executed is innocent.

<P><B>Here are just some of the facts and evidence in this case:</B>
<P>
<TABLE BORDER="0" CELLSPACING="0" CELLPADDING="4">
<TR BGCOLOR="#F0F0E0"><TD VALIGN=top><B>EVIDENCE...</B>
<TD>A car similar to the one owned by Jerry was seen at the scene. This car was a blue and white Blazer with an automatic transmission, bright tail lights, large off-road tyres and a man (not identified as Jerry) was seen in the driver's seat. He could be seen because of the interior light.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>FACT...</B>
<TD>Jerry's car was a blue and white Bronco, it had a standard transmission and, because it had recently been in an accident, had no tail lights. It had no interior light and had narrow street-tyres.
<TR BGCOLOR="#F0F0E0"><TD VALIGN=top><B>EVIDENCE...</B>
<TD>A hair was found on clothing belonging to Jerry. The State said that this hair was from the victim.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>FACT...</B>
<TD>This hair was long and blonde, the victim had short auburn hair, while Jerry's wife had long blonde hair. The t-shirt that the hair was found on had been bought the day before Jerry's arrest.
<TR BGCOLOR="#F0F0E0"><TD VALIGN=top><B>EVIDENCE...</B>
<TD>A semen sample indicated that the murderer was a secretor with foreign markers F, X and B.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>FACT...</B>
<TD>Jerry is a non-secretor with foreign markers F and B. Markers can be dropped during testing, but not picked up.
<TR BGCOLOR="#F0F0E0"><TD VALIGN=top><B>EVIDENCE...</B>
<TD>Jerry was convicted of another offence that allegedly took place at the same time, but in another county.
<TR><TD VALIGN=top><B>FACT...</B>
<TD>True! The drive from the location of the other offence to the location of the murder is approximately one hour. There were two witnesses who could identify Jerry for this robbery, but not one witness who could identify him as the murderer. He received 20 years for the robbery and the death penalty for the murder!
