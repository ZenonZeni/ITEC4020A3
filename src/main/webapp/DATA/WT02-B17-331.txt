<H2>Suriname Rain Forest At Risk</H3>
<P>

<H3>CI Presses Parliament to Adopt Economic Alternatives</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
Paramaribo, Suriname: One of the largest undisturbed stretches of tropical rain forest in the world may be placed at the mercy of three Asian logging conglomerates with questionable environmental track records. The government of Suriname is currently considering logging concession deals that would affect seven million acres --
about one-fourth of the country's land. "What Suriname is being asked to do is sell off a major portion of its forest assets for promises of economic return that are only a fraction of the true value of these forests, and even that return is uncertain. Indeed some analyses indicate that these concessions will wind up costing Suriname money over the long term," said CI President Russ Mittermeier. "This kind of neocolonial exploitation has no place at the end of the 20th century."
<P>
Several timely factors have encouraged the Surinamese Parliament to delay approval of the concessions. First, CI's resource economist, Dick Rice, prepared a realistic analysis of the proposed concession agreements, refocusing the debate on issues of actual profit and loss. A delegation of government and private forest experts organized by the U.S. State Department concluded from this report that Suriname would make only a small fraction of anticipated revenue due to the many loopholes in the contracts.
<P>
Alternatives to Concessions. CI has also encouraged Suriname to consider economic alternatives to logging. In June, a CI-sponsored visit to Costa Rica for a group of Suriname Parliament members yielded important information on development options and caused a further delay on the logging concession vote. The Suriname delegates met with Costa Rican President Jos Maria Figueres Olsen, who urged the delegates not to undersell themselves, but rather to take advantage of Costa Rica's experience in working toward sustainability. The delegates learned firsthand about Costa Rica's achievements in ecotourism and bioprospecting, two potentially profitable alternatives to logging. According to Figueres, Suriname can leap-frog over an entire era of natural resource misuse and become a 21st century model for appropriate development.    	
<P>
Despite the success of the trip, the debate in Suriname has reached a critical point. The Asian loggers are pushing for a quick decision from the Suriname Parliament. Many key Surinamese politicians see the investments, which the companies claim would total over $250 million, as a key step in bolstering the country's collapsing economy.
<P>
Seeking a short-term solution to Suriname's financial crisis, Mittermeier, joined by CI's Policy Vice President Ian Bowles and other European and U.S. NGO leaders, met with Inter-American Development Bank President, Enrique Iglesias, in part prompting the IDB to propose a financial-assistance plan to Suriname's President Ronald Venetiaan. Following CI's strategy, the IDB is organizing another Surinamese delegation to Costa Rica in September.
<P>
CI is already overseeing a significant economic initiative that has begun to produce income for Suriname: a bioprospecting agreement that links the U.S.-based pharmaceutical company, Bristol-Myers Squibb, the National Institutes of Health, Surinamese government agencies and NGOs, and the indigenous Saramakaner tribe. "Royalties from even one new plant-derived drug would dwarf logging money, without taking down trees," said Mittermeier. 
<P>
Spotlight on Suriname. A final key factor has been the media attention generated over the proposed logging of this virtually untouched wilderness. Mittermeier, whose research has targeted Suriname's forests for the last 20 years, has been instrumental in bringing the debate before an international audience. He has published op-eds in the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I> and <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, given interviews to <I>Associated Press</I> TV, Voice of America, and the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>, and escorted ABC TV crews and reporters from <I>Time Magazine</I> and the <I>Washington Post</I> to Suriname.    
<P>
"What happens in Suriname will send a message around the world," concluded Mittermeier, "and set a precedent for the few remaining nations harboring expanses of untouched forests."</BLOCKQUOTE>
