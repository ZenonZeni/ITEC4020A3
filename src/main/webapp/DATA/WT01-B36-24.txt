<h2>l0. The Death of God</h2>

<hr>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thomas J. J. Altizer, the Young Turk of Christian
theology, had gee-whizzed to fame on the strength of a single
four-letter word. He was holding on to that word for dear life.
And then, for one breathless moment, it appeared as if he might
let it dribble through his fingers. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The word was &quot;dead.&quot; As in &quot;God is
Dead.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The occasion was a symposium at Northwestern
University, in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, where Altizer
appeared on a panel with Walter Kaufmann, the Princeton
philosopher, and Harvey Cox, author of <i>The Secular City</i>.
Altizer had become the most controversial spokesman for the
ultra-radical Death of God theology. Again, this was in 1966,
shortly before my meeting with Bishop Robinson at Wabash, and I
attended the symposium in hopes of discovering just what it was
that Altizer had been trying to say. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody seemed certain. As it developed, nobody had
really asked him before. After the symposium I did ask him, and
later I had a lengthy interview with him following his return to
Atlanta and his duties as associate professor of Bible and
religion at Emory University. If nothing else, Altizer made it
perfectly clear exactly what he meant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He arrived at the Northwestern symposium in a
canary-yellow sport coat, black slacks, ice-blue shirt, flame-red
tie, baby-blue wool socks, and brown brogans. He had tousled
black hair and looked a little like the movie actor Glenn Ford.
When he addressed the audience, however, he no longer looked like
Glenn Ford. He looked and sounded like one of Plato's divine
madmen. He had charisma, and lots of it. And what he said was
pure poetry. Everybody agreed it was poetry, because it was very
beautiful, and nobody could understand it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I apologize for my presence,&quot; he said.
&quot;I'm incapable of speaking about man. I find myself almost
speechless. Almost the only word that may be spoken about man in
our time is a word that attempts to express the darkness of
ourselves. And this darkness is the body of the dead God.... If
faith can but whisper in our world, it can take a step toward
life. And we can never take that step until we truly know that
God is Dead. We can say with thanksgiving, 'God is Dead. Thank
God.'&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not only what Altizer said; it was his
tremulous, Margaret O'Brien way of saying it. A professor winced,
turned and whispered, &quot;How can he bear to do it&#151;strip
himself naked this way?&quot; &quot;He's sick,&quot; said one.
&quot;Inspired,&quot; said another. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer had been described as speaking at times in
mystical overtones, but that did not go far enough. Rather, he
presented the image of a full-fledged, card-carrying
visionary&#151;a profane mystic haunted by an apocalyptic vision
of cosmic dimensions. At one point, responding to a sharply
worded question, he told the audience in Billy Budd-ish
frustration: &quot;Sometimes I feel like a man who stutters and
can't speak. Sometimes I feel like a man in a room where a
foreign and untranslatable language is being spoken&#151;but he
has to speak nevertheless.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As he did speak, his references to the dead God
became even more enigmatic. They were voiced in the present and
future tenses. &quot;God is.&quot; &quot;God will.&quot; As it
turned out later, this was significant. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Before the audience, Altizer did tend to express
himself in arcane symbolism. But later, at a student bull
session, a different Altizer took the floor. This was Altizer the
scholar, Altizer the theologian, Altizer the metaphysician. The
vision was switched off, intellect was switched on, and Altizer
himself was no longer obscure; he was instead a thoughtful man
who was doing his best to express an obscure idea: like a
mathematician who has been asked to describe the taste of
peppermint. He was friendly, amusing, intelligent, and eager to
communicate. He knew what he meant; questioned carefully, he said
what he meant&#151;and he did not mean what most people had
seemed to think he meant. Listening to him, it appeared
increasingly ironic that Altizer had somehow come to be
identified with that mainstream phenomenon known as the New
Theology, in so far as that refers to the secularization of the
church and a this-worldly involvement in social problems; it
seemed even more ironic that the New Theology had come to be
identified with Altizer. This was a gigantic error, Altizer
agreed. Grinning, puffing on a fragrant pipe, he explained his
vision. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; What it boiled down to was a highly unorthodox
interpretation of the Incarnation: of the Word becoming flesh in
the person of Jesus Christ. What Altizer was talking about was
transcendence, and immanence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We have said it is possible to conceive of God as
both transcendent <i>and</i> immanent, and we recalled the
analogy to the relationship between Shakespeare and the
characters in <i>The Tempest</i>. Shakespeare obviously is
immanent in his characters, since they owe their existence to
him; but he also transcends them, in the sense that they do not
exhaust his being: he has a separate existence above and beyond
them. Altizer began with a fairly traditional view of God
somewhat along these lines, accepting the idea of a
transcendent-immanent divinity. And he also accepted the
Incarnation as a historic fact: God manifesting himself in the
world in the flesh of Jesus. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For years, however, he brooded upon the full
significance of this event. He immersed himself in a study of
Eastern mysticism, Nietzsche, Hegel, William Blake&#151;and he
thought hard about the Incarnation. Then, one day while he was
reading, it came to him. It all fell in place. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Incarnation happened. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; So did the Crucifixion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But not the Resurrection! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This idea is the essence of Altizer's theology. God
had incarnated himself in the body of Jesus; but when Jesus died,
God did not &quot;jump back up into heaven.&quot; He remained in
the world. He is in the world now. What God did, said Altizer,
was &quot;empty himself of transcendence.&quot; He became totally
immanent in the universe. He became part of the universe. But he
did not, immediately, become all of the universe. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At first he was immanent only in Jesus. Since the
death of Jesus he has continued to embed himself deeper and
deeper into the fabric of the universe. No longer transcendent in
any sense, he is in the process even now of becoming ever more
immanent. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Jesus, to Altizer, was &quot;the original
Christ.&quot; Christ was that point where God entered the world.
And Altizer retains the word Christ to signify the God who
remains in the world, becoming more and more a part of it. The
word &quot;spirit&quot; might do just as well, said Altizer. But
for various reasons he would prefer to &quot;stick with the word
Christ.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; More often than not, however, Altizer in his
conversation spoke neither of Christ nor of spirit. He kept right
on speaking of &quot;God.&quot; When this was called to his
attention, he conceded: &quot;In a certain sense I treat Christ
as God. But the word bears an entirely different meaning from the
dominant meaning of God. That's why I resist the word God.&quot;
He resisted it all evening with little success. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer described the movement toward greater
immanence as an evolutionary, creative process; it is leading
toward a final Christ: an apocalyptic new godhead in which God
will be all there is. Altizer spoke of &quot;a new world that
will dawn at the end of the old world.&quot; He spoke of &quot;a
totally new creation&#151;new man, new world, new life.&quot;
When he speaks of the death of God, said Altizer, he is speaking
of the passage from transcendence to immanence. Eventually the
new and different godhead will be realized, he said. But even
now, before it is realized, man can rejoice in a new sense of
freedom. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Man finds himself in darkness, said Altizer.
&quot;And this darkness is the body of the dead God.&quot; But
once the darkness is recognized for what it is, it can be
accepted. &quot;Only a rotting body in a tomb,&quot; said
Altizer. &quot;It can't bind us to it, once we have known it
truly as an empty darkness. Then, at that moment, we can truly be
liberated from it.&quot; The transcendent power has ended, and
man is free. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shakespeare has entered his own play, Altizer
seemed to be saying. Eventually he will be the play&#151;and then
he will write a final act which incorporates the preceding five
but is wholly different. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;I make the Incarnation everything,&quot;
Altizer summed up, adding, necessarily, that he gives the rest of
the Bible &quot;only a very limited allegiance.&quot; His
interpretation of the Incarnation was entirely consistent, he
said. &quot;Christ has come, and you hurl him back into heaven.
This is a complete betrayal of Christ. Only by seeing God's death
in Christ can we be true to Christ.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the bull session, the Northwestern students
fired questions at Altizer, and, as they did so, it was possible
to trace many of his concepts back to their sources. A wholly
immanent God, after all, is scarcely a new idea: it is the idea
of Eastern pantheism, pure and simple, and Altizer conceded he
was talking pantheism. The God of the East is &quot;very
real,&quot; he said, and &quot;infinitely more realistic&quot;
than the traditional Western God. One could opt for this God, he
said. But there is one important sense in which Altizer would
distinguish his position from the Eastern view, and we shall
return to this point in a later chapter. Briefly, for now,
Altizer's theology suggests that the cosmic process is
evolutionary&#151;that it is leading up to something&#151;while
Eastern metaphysics supposedly rejects the evolutionary
hypothesis. The East &quot;looks backward to a primordial
totality&quot; (according to Altizer), and Altizer on the other
hand &quot;looks forward&quot; to an eschatological totality
which is utterly transformed and aware of itself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer of course had taken his God-is-Dead tag
from Nietzsche, and the new sense of freedom echoed Blake's
mystical emphasis upon man: his delight in man's liberty and his
rejection of any transcendent authority, his absorption with
Jesus and his denial of God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer acknowledged his debt to Blake and
Nietzsche. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There also seemed nothing new in the idea of an
evolving spirit. That derived from Hegel, as Altizer was pleased
to point out. But it also sounded very much like Henri Bergson's
vital force. As a matter of fact, it sounded even more like
Teilhard de Chardin's view of the universe. Again, we shall have
more to say about this in another chapter, and we shall limit
ourselves for the moment to only one aspect of Teilhard's
metaphysics. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard, a Jesuit paleontologist, had proposed an
evolutionary theory based upon the increasing complexification of
inert matter. He proposed that mankind was moving toward the
realization of a new godhead which Teilhard referred to as the
Omega point. And he saw in this process the hand of God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The key to it all: the Incarnation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Teilhard described evolution as &quot;a prodigious
biological operation&#151;that of the Redeeming
Incarnation.&quot; He added: &quot;As early as in St. Paul and
St. John we read that to create, to fulfill and to purify the
world is, for God, to unify it by uniting it organically with
himself.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how would God unify the world? Teilhard
answered: &quot;By partially immersing himself in things, by
becoming 'element,' and then, from this point of vantage in the
heart of matter, assuming the control and leadership of what we
now call evolution.&quot; This immersion, said Teilhard, was
through Christ&#151;who &quot;put himself in the position
(maintained ever since) to subdue under himself . . . the general
ascent of consciousness into which he inserted himself.... And
when he has gathered everything together and transformed
everything, he will close in upon himself and his conquests,
thereby rejoining, in a final gesture, the divine focus he has
never left. Then, as St. Paul tells us, God shall be all in
all.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I asked Altizer about this, and Altizer
acknowledged his IOU to Teilhard. (He suggested later that I may
have overwritten the amount a bit, but I doubt it.) He largely
accepted Teilhard's view, Altizer said. It represented &quot;the
most important theological work in a long time.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That seemed to leave Altizer with little to call
his own, apart from his unique view of the Incarnation. Even
there, he appeared to be separated from Teilhard by a single
word: <i>&quot;partially.&quot;</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The students jumped on what was left. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;That which was God,&quot; said Altizer,
&quot;will finally be real and present again in a wholly new
form&#151;if you like, in Teilhard's Omega point.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, then, God wasn't really dead, was he? Altizer
more or less conceded than &quot;transformed&quot; might be more
accurate&#151;that the passage from transcendence to immanence
meant &quot;a totally new form of the godhead.&quot; &quot;So we
shouldn't panic?&quot; asked a student. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Well,&quot; said Altizer, &quot;the Christian
church should. Because I'm saying that everything they stand for
is dead.&quot; Pressed again on his word choice, Altizer said of
God: &quot;I think he's dead in a very crucial way . . . in his
original divine form. Everything the Christian has called God is
dead.&quot; All this sounded remarkably close to the minimal
concession that theologians had been trying to wring from Altizer
for some time. God lives, but man's concept of him is outdated.
In my subsequent interview with him, after his return to Georgia,
Altizer picked up his word and ran with it again: a less drastic
word might fail to make the point, he said&#151;and, as a
newspaperman, I could certainly appreciate this. Suppose that
first story coming out of Atlanta had begun: &quot;A theologian
here says God is immanent.&quot; The story would never have come
out of Atlanta in the first place; the complex and productive
arguments behind the catchword might never have seen the light,
and Altizer, at best, would be an obscure Dixie heretic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The word was not important really. What seemed to
upset the Northwestern students far more was Altizer's
fundamentally apocalyptic view of the world. Once understood,
Altizer appeared to stand in direct contradiction to the radical
theology his name had come to dominate&#151;because the main
thrust of that theology had probably been messianic and
pragmatic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Radical theology is a big tent, and it has
sheltered other theologians who also have said that God is Dead.
But these others have not meant that God is Dead in Altizer's
sense&#151;nor indeed have they really meant that God is Dead in
any sense. Some of the people who are associated with this phrase
have meant to say simply that the <i>word</i> God is dead; they
have abandoned the word as a semantic wreck which means all
things to all men, and they have tried to clarify the concept
through linguistic analysis. Others have studied God talk as a <i>cultural</i>
phenomenon, asserting that man creates God in his own image, so
to speak&#151;that his idea of God is molded by his cultural
prejudices&#151;and they have tried to identify the real divinity
which exists perhaps behind the man-made idols. Still others have
meant that God is <i>hidden</i> or mysterious, as Job found him
to be, beyond the power of human comprehension, and they have
called upon us to abandon the vain effort to understand God
metaphysically, recommending instead that we do God's work by
seeking social justice here on earth. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Still another school appears to derive its
inspiration largely from Bonhoeffer. Its advocates speak of God
as <i>absent</i> in the sense that modern man no longer is
capable of experiencing God: the reality of God has somehow gone
dead on him. But absence is not the same as death, and Altizer's
fellow radical William Hamilton, for example, has referred to
&quot;our waiting for God,&quot; implying that God perhaps will
one day return: it may be that he has simply withdrawn for a
time, in order that we may achieve our adulthood in Bonhoeffer's
&quot;world come of age.&quot; In one of his essays, Hamilton
said he followed Bonhoeffer in rejecting <i>religion</i>&#151;which
is to say, &quot;any system of thought or action in which God or
the gods serve as fulfiller of needs or solver of problems.&quot;
Hamilton described radical theology as a movement from the church
to the world&#151;a letting go of God's hand, as it were. And he
added: &quot;This combination of a certain kind of God-rejection
with a certain kind of world-affirmation is the point where I
join the death of God movement.... If God is not needed, if it is
to the world and not God that we repair for our needs and
problems, then perhaps we may come to see that he is to be
enjoyed and delighted in.... Our waiting for God, our
godlessness, is partly a search for a language and a style by
which we might be enabled to stand before him once again,
delighting in his presence.&quot; In other words, we won't come
home again until we have made it all by ourselves in the big
city, or rather the big cosmos&#151;and then won't Father be
proud of us? Then we can sit on the front-porch swing together
and trade stories, man to man, and really get to know each other.
No more of this writing home for money; enough of this juvenile
dependency relationship: Andy Hardy is growing up. We are falling
into parody here, but it is not our intention to poke fun; we are
merely trying to communicate a rather difficult idea, somewhat in
the manner of an editorial-page cartoonist. Hamilton, in any
case, has probably been the best-known Death of God theologian
next to Altizer, and Hamilton clearly has not been saying the
same thing that Altizer has been saying. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer really stands by himself. Only he has taken
a position which might be construed to imply an actual Death of
God, and even in his case a stretch of the imagination is
required to justify that word Death. He is in fact talking about
the Transformation of God. Nevertheless, Altizer has been the
only Death of God theologian to propose a really radical
metaphysics. He has been the only one to suggest that an actual <i>change</i>
has occurred in the nature or ontology of God. The orthodox
atheist says that God never existed in the first place. Bishop
Robinson and the demythologizers say we ought to change our ideas
about God. Altizer alone says that God himself has changed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer also rejects the idea that theology has
anything to do with social action. In fact he scoffs at the idea,
and he ridicules the secularizers who are trying to make the
church &quot;relevant.&quot; (&quot;Suddenly the church had
something to do.&quot;) He is not against good works, of course;
but he feels that the secularizers are simply putting old wine
into new bottles, and Altizer wants a new wine. He can argue, and
does, that good works have nothing to do with the relevance of
the church; he can argue, and does, that the business of
theologians is theology; he can argue, and does, that only he and
a few others have been doing theology. Harvey Cox is a physician,
Altizer is a metaphysician. Only Altizer has been asking ultimate
questions about the nature of God and reality. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The secularizers have been responding to history
and to social forces, and many people, missing his meaning, have
supposed that Altizer is doing the same thing. They interpret his
message as a kind of existential reaction to the modern world and
the impact of technology; they think he is this-worldly, as the
secularizers are. But that is wrong. Altizer did not start with
the world, he said. He started with his vision. That is what he
is talking about, and that is what concerns him: not the world as
such, but a vision of the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer at Northwestern fulminated against
otherworldliness. He implied he was this-worldly, since after all
he had equated God with this world. It seemed fair, however, to
put him in his own category and describe him instead as
inner-worldly. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; He told the Northwestern students that civil rights
was a &quot;phony nineteenth-century issue&quot; as far as church
relevance was concerned. In fact, he said, since divine authority
had collapsed (since the transcendent deity was dead), there was
absolutely no basis left for moral decision-making. &quot;A
Christian can't make decisions on Viet Nam,&quot; he said. Nor
had a Christian much to hope for at the moment. There was, said
Altizer, no messianic hope for &quot;this world, this history,
this society.&quot; There was only the apocalyptic hope for
&quot;the total transformation of all things.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Suppose I accept your dead God?&quot; said a
co-ed. &quot;Where do I get my Brownie points?&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer could offer her only Omega points&#151;and
a sense of freedom to do something or other. Whatever she wanted
to, apparently. He did not offer the God-is-love message of
Bishop Robinson and the secularizers. In several hours, in fact,
the word love never came up. Just that other word. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer returned to Atlanta, and we later had the
following conversation: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Let me see if I understand your viewpoint
correctly, from what you said the other night. You believe, do
you not, that there once was a transcendent God? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Was this God wholly transcendent, or was he also
immanent in the world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Both transcendent and immanent. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Did he create the world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. This gets more difficult theologically. I do not
believe in a literal creation or creation story. Frankly, I
haven't worked this out. It's merely tentative. But I think in
terms of a kind of evolution of the cosmos. There was an original
totality in which all things were one&#151;no separation between
nature, man, and God. And out of this totality there evolved the
world or the cosmos as a distinct entity&#151;and also God. I
think in a certain sense God appears as creator in conjunction
with the world's coming to exist apart from God. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. As I understand it, you believe God emptied
himself of transcendence and became immanent in the
world&#151;that he incarnated himself in the person of Jesus.
That sounds orthodox, to a point. But you stop with the
Incarnation. You reject the Resurrection. You say, &quot;God did
not jump back up into heaven.&quot; You say he stayed right here
in the world after the Crucifixion. Is that correct? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Correct. I believe the fullness, the totality of
God passed into Christ, moving ever more deeply and fully and
comprehensively into the world, flesh, consciousness, and
experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Why did God decide to do this? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. He didn't decide. I understand the Incarnation
as implicit and essential in the whole process of cosmic
movement. There was no arbitrary point where a decision was
reached. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. So God is no longer transcendent but is immanent
right now in the world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That's right.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But in what is he immanent? In mankind? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I wouldn't say only mankind. As I told you at
Northwestern, I reverence Teilhard's vision and largely accept
it. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. By that, I take it you mean God is immanent in
the cosmos as a whole? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Really yes, in the entire cosmos. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You speak of Jesus as the original Christ. Do
you mean by that there have been other, latter-day Christs? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Originally the Incarnation was in the man Jesus.
And then, following the Crucifixion, Christ progressively enters
the fullness of history and experience, ever more fully and
comprehensively becoming actual in the world . . . a forward
movement . . . Christ becoming ever more actual, ever more real,
ever more incarnate. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You mean this is an evolutionary process that
isn't finished yet? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I like to think of this immanence itself as a
gradual process. God once was real and actual as a transcendent
lord. He negated himself. Nevertheless, his epiphany or
manifestation as lord continues to linger in human experience,
and it has a certain reality in that experience. I call this the
dead body of God. It's real in human experience. And it will
continue to be real until it is totally negated by the total
dawning of the incarnate Christ. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You mean there are parts of the cosmos in which
Christ is not yet wholly incarnate? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. All this sounds rather like pantheism. Is it? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I think it is . . . in the same sense that
Teilhard's vision is. In the cosmic process, it's a kind of
dynamic pantheism&#151; God ever becoming other than he was in
the past&#151;but nevertheless pantheism in that God eventually
will be all in all. Call it a dynamic-process pantheism. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Could your immanent God in any sense be
interpreted to mean the Holy Ghost? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Possibly. I'd almost be willing to use the word
spirit. I'd be willing. In part I do. It's just that this word
spirit is so kicked around these days. I'd rather stick with the
word Christ. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But doesn't all this say something entirely
different from God is dead? You keep speaking of God in the
present tense and the future tense. You agreed at Northwestern, I
believe, that transformed&#151;completely transformed&#151;was
perhaps more accurate than dead. That it was the church's concept
of God that was utterly dead. Isn't that what you said at
Northwestern? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Well, I also want to say the transcendent lord
is dead. He's become totally immanent, totally flesh, totally
world. If I just speak of transformation, I fear the whole point
will be lost. I'm really saying that the God a Christian prays to
and worships is dead. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Dead? You start with a transcendent God and you
end up with an immanent God. It seems to me you've killed the
adjective, not the noun. The noun is God, and the noun remains. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. All right. But it doesn't remain in the
sense that it still is what it was before. That which God has
become is wholly other. And there is, to my knowledge, no form of
Christian doctrine that admits or asserts this&#151;that God has
decisively transformed himself. I think God as God has died, and
God has passed into Christ. And he lives in Christ . . . but only
lives in Christ himself. If you like, God the father is dead. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Would you call yourself an atheist? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. I do. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. The question arises, how do you know all this? I
believe you have stated that it came to you one day while you
were reading in the University of Chicago library. Could you
describe the nature of your experience? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That must be about ten years ago now. It was the
summer of 1955, I guess. I was reading Erich Heller's essay on
Nietzsche and Rilke. It was a very intense personal experience.
I'd been thinking about these things for years, of course.
Suddenly I was overwhelmed.... I felt it. I sensed it. And once
having sensed it, I've never been able to lose that sense. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. I assume this wasn't something you arrived at by
a purely rational process, from empirical evidence. Would it be
fair to call it a revelation? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I'm afraid that would mislead too many people. I
think this theological position is simply a consistent
consequence of thinking fully and radically about the meaning of
the Incarnation. Once you grant that God fully and finally became
man in Jesus Christ, you can largely think through this whole
thing. Also, it's rooted in what I believe to be modern and
contemporary Christian experience and thinking. And I employ
people like Blake and Nietzsche as spokesmen for this radical
Christian vision. I base my work on theirs. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You often speak of your vision. Wasn't this
really a personal vision you had? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Let's put it this way. I believe there does in
fact exist a great body of materials of various kinds that
reflect and embody a modern radical Christian vision. For
example, the works of William Blake. I haven't had these visions.
I'm no visionary. I seek to be an interpreter of them. Then
there's also Hegel's logic as a conceptual expression of the same
thing. You can build on the vision and think it through. Hegel
allows you to see how Blake's vision is really a consistent
resolution of the Christian faith. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But you didn't start with Hegel. Wouldn't you
say this understanding of yours came originally from a
non-rational source? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Oh yes. Every kind of understanding comes
originally from a source other than the empirical, the rational.
I'd include Freud and Marx in that category. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Would it be fair, then, to describe your vision
as basically mystical in nature? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. There is a higher vision; or, if you like, a
radically profane mystical vision. There is such a thing as a
modern mystical vision, yes. But it's not the same as traditional
[otherworldly] mysticism. It's radically profane. It's directed
to the here and now&#151;to life, flesh, energy. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You told the students the other night you
couldn't help them make up their minds on Viet Nam and other
issues. You said your view provided no basis for moral
decision-making. What did you mean? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Well, basically this. My view does not lead to
an ethical system or set of moral laws. I don't think anyone can
think responsibly about ethical problems today. Man has lost the
ability. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You said civil rights was a phony
nineteenth-century issue. What did you mean by that? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. The problem itself, it seems to me, is basically
a matter of a group of people, Negroes, entering bourgeois,
middle-class society. And that basically is an eighteenth- or
nineteenth-century problem. It's an old problem, not a problem
peculiar to the twentieth century. I think the church has falsely
prided itself on being able to speak relevantly on this issue,
when it's not really a contemporary issue at all. Further, we are
now moving into a phase of the problem that's highly technical
and modern. And as we do, the church will have increasingly less
and less to say. It will have to be solved by technicians
basically&#151;by economists and sociologists. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You mean the church shouldn't speak out on the
issue? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. No, that's not the point. The church should not
pride itself on being relevant. These church people congratulate
themselves. They say, &quot;See how relevant the church is.&quot;
And I think that's a great illusion. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Are you saying there's no teleological or
ultimate basis for any kind of a morality at all? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. All I'm saying is, as far as I can see right
now, there is no source of moral or human insight into
contemporary human and social problems. This is a period of
terrible darkness we're going through. Either there is no basis
for morality or I just can't see it. Nobody else can see it
either. But I think it will come. I hope it will. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Shouldn't clergymen involve themselves in civil
rights marches? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Oh sure, sure. But we've reached the point
already where there aren't going to be any civil rights marches.
There won't be any role for churchmen to play. Their basic job
was to identify the problem, to attract public attention. And now
they've done that. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. And now they have another job? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That's the great problem. What is that job? I
think the church has to be totally reformed. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. Until you came along, the mainstream of
Christian upheaval seemed partly at least a reaction to social
forces&#151;Bonhoeffer reacting to the Nazis, Cox to
urbanization, Robinson to secularization. The reformers seemed to
be calling for social involvement and more or less suspending
judgment on the fine points of theology. That is, they seemed to
start with the world. But you seem to start with this inner
vision of yours. Is that a fair statement? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. It's fair to say I started with the vision
rather than the world. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. And your vision should in no way be interpreted
as a call to social action, to solve the problems of the world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That's right. That's not for me. But I don't
want to say it can't involve social action. Each one must find
his own way. It's a new kind of freedom if you like. This is why
the Death of God is pretty crucial. There's no longer any kind of
divine law to follow. It's no longer there. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. How would you differentiate yourself from people
like Harvey Cox and Bishop Robinson, who say Christians should
seek God by involving themselves directly in the problems of the
world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. The people I call secularists, they're basically
church reformers. They're reacting to a form of Christian
religiosity which has turned itself completely away from our
world. They want basically to restructure the form of the church,
to make the church relevant. They're not concerned with
transforming the heart of the Christian gospel. They think that's
the same, and that's given, always. I myself, and Hamilton and
others, belong to a radical group who believe the very heart of
the Christian center has got to be transformed. The transcendent
God the church has worshiped is no more. One difference is, Cox
is not really a theologian. He's not interested in constructing a
theological vision or system. Robinson, too. I'm concerned with a
full theological understanding of contemporary faith. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. In other words, you're more metaphysical? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Yes. Except that word is such a . . . it makes
people see red. I'm not a Thomist or anything like that. But I am
concerned with an ultimate vision, with a full understanding of
faith in the world today. Teilhard was metaphysical in this
sense. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. As one of the students asked the other night,
&quot;Where do I get my Brownie points?&quot; What good does your
vision do, and what's in it for me? Isn't it just morbid
introspection, this naming of the darkness? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. I think it's liberating to know God is Dead.
Otherwise, inevitably, consciously or unconsciously, we will look
upon reality as being something alien. Something we can't really
know. We'll be victims of it, slaves of it, because it's
mysterious. To know God is Dead is to be liberated from the
threat of an unknown world, the threat of mystery. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. What is the nature of the light you say you see
burning beyond the darkness? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. That dawns in accordance with the degree with
which darkness is unveiled. And it's a light that makes possible
freedom from oppression right now. To the extent that we're
liberated from darkness, we are able to give ourselves to life.
And life itself becomes light. Darkness becomes light. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. This ultimate consummation we're moving
toward&#151;is the nature of it predestined? Or is the
evolutionary process creative, in the Bergsonian sense? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Something like the latter. Except that
everything that happens in the world will be a part of that final
Omega point. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. You said the other night that God in a certain
sense remains transcendent. What did you mean? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. We were speaking in the context of Judaism. I
think the Jew can indeed know a transcendent God. The Jew lives
in a kind of eternal covenant with God, and he can preserve this
because he lives in exile&#151;because he is not totally involved
in our history. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. How can this be? Are you saying there are two
Gods, a Jewish God who's alive and a Christian God who's Dead? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. The Jew actually is in communion with that
ancient epiphany of God&#151;has preserved and perpetuated that
moment in faith. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But you said that was over. Are you saying Jews
worship a God who isn't there&#151;a false God? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. It's a false God as far as the Christian is
concerned. But I see no reason for the Christian to attack it as
such. What must be attacked are the forms of Judaism that
maintain themselves within Christianity. That's the real danger. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. But is it a false God as far as the Jew is
concerned? Are you simply saying the Jew has a right to worship
as he pleases? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. No. I think It's possible for the Jew actually
to be in communion with this God. Christians must be totally
immersed in history. Jews don't have to be. They're in exile. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Q. I think there was another sense in which you
said God remains transcendent. You were debating the point with a
philosophy major, and finally you agreed with him. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A. Oh! The problem there was, he was using
transcendent in a different sense&#151;to refer to something
beyond the given, beyond the brute actuality of experience. He
was using it in terms of vision. That's in a sense transcendent.
In that sense, everything I say is transcendental. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer said he represents a far more basic
challenge to orthodox Christianity than the secularizers do, and
no doubt he does &#151;for he represents that influx of Eastern
ideas we talked about: he represents pantheism. And pantheism is
in the air, no question about that. The doctrine of transcendence
is challenged today as never before, and in Altizer's
theology&#151;as in LSD cultism&#151;Eastern immanence is given
full and final expression. In one of his articles, Altizer called
upon the American theologian to &quot;cast off his German
tutors&quot; and &quot;open himself both to the religious world
of the East and to the deeper sensibility of the Western
present.&quot; He added: &quot;From the East we may once more
learn the meaning of the sacred.... We can encounter in the East
a form of the sacred which Christianity has never known, a form
which is increasingly showing itself to be relevant to our
situation.&quot; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Obviously, the leap to the East is just as evident
in radical theology as it is in the drug movement, at least in so
far as this implies a leap from transcendence to
immanence&#151;and if Altizer has been the only important
theologian so far to embrace pantheism without reservation, less
radical radicals have been embracing it with reservations. On a
superficial level at least, it is not much of a jump from
Robinson's position to Altizer's (which is not to imply that
Altizer derives from Robinson; in fact, Altizer was publishing
his views for a non-popular reader ship several years before <i>Honest
to God</i> saw print), and radical theology on the whole can be
characterized essentially as a movement in the direction of
immanence. It is significant perhaps that Harvey Cox, that
squarest of all the radicals, was able to defend transcendence at
Northwestern only in a very limited way. He suggested it was
&quot;too early&quot; to foreclose the possibility of a
transcendent God; the discussion, he said, should &quot;remain
open.&quot; It could be that man is simply incapable of answering
the question one way or the other. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Once the shock effect has worn off, the Death of
God slogan may lose much of its appeal, and Altizer perhaps will
suffer an eclipse. Once understood, his apocalyptic message is
not likely to capture the imagination of this messianic Peace
Corps generation, and his unique view of the Incarnation is
subject to considerable criticism. To some degree at least,
Altizer has owed his success to the fact that few people have
actually grasped his meaning&#151;the attacks against him have
not been well informed&#151;and, from one point of view, the best
way to attack him is to explain him fully. But the loss of an
unfortunate slogan will not put an end to the radical examination
of transcendence, and Altizer's path to immanence is not the only
one. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Altizer is both in and out of the radical
mainstream. He is in it so far as he leans toward immanence; he
is out of it so far as he rejects the messianic hope for this
world in the here and now. Particularly is he out of it in his
apparent rejection (or neglect) of a primary essence or condition
of Being which might provide the basis for an ethical system.
This essence or condition has meanwhile been given its due by the
drug movement and by the bishop of Woolwich&#151;and it also is
central to that emerging phenomenon which is sometimes described
as humanistic psychology. </p>
