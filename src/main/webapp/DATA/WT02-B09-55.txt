<h2 ALIGN=center> Keeping Your Cool In a Heat Wave</h2>


Many people enjoy the warmth and sunshine of long summer days. However, many of these same people overdo activities and suffer heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and life-threatening heat strokes. <p>


<BR>





According to the American Red Cross, heat can affect anyone. The key is to know how to prevent emergencies from occurring in the first place. Consider these heat wave safety tips:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Slow down. Avoid strenuous activities outside between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. If you must do strenuous activities, do them during the coolest part of the day, which is usually in the morning between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Stay inside. Air conditioning keeps you cool. If air conditioning isn't available, stay on the lowest level of the house, out of the sunshine. Electric, or ceiling, fans can help sweat evaporate, which cools your body. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Dress lightly. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing. Light colors will reflect away some of the sun's energy.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Drink water. Nothing satisfies thirst better than water. Drink plenty of water, even if you don't feel thirsty. Avoid drinks with alcohol or caffeine in them. They can make you feel good briefly, but make the heat's effect on your body worse. This is especially true of beer, which  actually dehydrates the body.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Eat small meals, more often. Choose lighter foods and fewer proteins, which increase metabolic heat. Avoid using salt tablets unless directed to do so by your doctor.<BR>



<BR>

If you exercise outdoors, follow these safety rules:<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Build up resistance to the heat slowly. Know your limits and slow down when you tire.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Exercise early in the morning or late in the evening.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Carry a water bottle. Drink a few ounces every 15 minutes and try squirting some water on your body to cool off.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stay in the shade. For example, pick a jogging or biking route through a shaded area.<BR>



<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Stop if you begin to feel woozy. Go inside and drink water. Call for help if the feeling doesn't subside.<BR>



<BR>



</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Heart Disease: A Preventable Disaster</h2>


If a natural disaster wiped out a million North Americans, the whole world would panic. But that many people die each year from the personal disaster of heart disease. <p>


<BR>





To reduce your risk of heart disease, apply these suggestions:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Control your blood pressure. High blood pressure causes constant high-pressured pumping which can wear out the heart and blood vessels. Cut salt in your diet and increase your potassium and calcium intake. Eat bananas, potatoes and low-fat dairy products, like yogurt and skim milk, which have potassium and calcium.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Shed extra pounds. Risk rises as weight goes up. But don't be the victim of the latest fad diets. Lose weight gradually by eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol, high-fiber diet. <BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Avoid excessive alcohol. Drinking weakens kidneys and stiffens the arteries. Studies show that people who have three or more drinks a day have higher blood pressure than those who drink less.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Control stress. Suppressing anger, anxiety and other emotions tightens blood vessel walls and increases the heart's output. Reduce stress with these activities: deep breathing, exercise, volunteer work, gardening, prayer, talking with friends, playing with a pet, or any other activity that relaxes you. Seek help - talk to a friend or counselor, or join a support group.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Snuff out cigarettes. Tobacco products contribute to high blood pressure and increase your risk of heart disease. Talk to your doctor about how to stop your smoking habit.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Eat fish. Fish contain heart-saving omega-3 fatty acids, which help cut cholesterol. Some of the best types of fish to eat are salmon, mackerel, sardines, trout and haddock.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Munch on apples. Apples contain pectin, a soluble fiber which helps reduce your cholesterol level.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Exercise regularly. Exercise can break down plaque and send it to the liver for disposal. Exercise at least three times a week for 30 minutes. But avoid jumping into a fitness program. Start slowly and work up.<BR>



<BR>

<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Get checked regularly. Have your blood pressure, cholesterol level, weight and general health monitored regularly by your doctor.<BR>



<BR>

For more information, contact your local American Heart Association or call 1-800-242-8721.


</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center>Analyzing Risk of Early Heart Attack</h2>





The fatal heart attack of the 28-year-old Russian skater Sergei Grinkov is an example of how heart disease can strike in an instant without warning. However, Grinkov had a high cholesterol reading, high blood pressure and a family history of heart disease.<p>





For most people under age 44, the risk of heart attack is small. But for people with a family history of heart disease and high blood pressure, statistics are less than comforting. Smoking, being overweight, or having diabetes can also increase risk.<p>





Does your present lifestyle predestine you to heart disease? Check the statements below that describe your lifestyle:<p>





<ul>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Your blood pressure is checked regularly.<BR>


<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">You exercise at least 30 minutes, three times a week.<BR>


<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">Your weight is within your recommended amount.<BR>


<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">You don't smoke and try to avoid secondhand smoke.<BR>


<BR><IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif">You eat a balanced diet and limit your intake of saturated fat and cholesterol.<BR>


<BR>If you checked less than five, set new goals and strive to lead a more healthy lifestyle.


</ul>
