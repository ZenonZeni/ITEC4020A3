<P><B>ARGENTINA</B>  &#167;   The belt-tightening package issued by the new
economy minister expands the VAT, raises  import taxes, cuts export incentives,
raises fuel taxes, seeks to staunch losses in the pension system and taxes
foreign loans. It is supposed to assure stability and lay the ground work for
growth. But few in Argentina believe it will do this and Fernandez faces an
uphill battle to get support for it. &#167;  More cases of blatant corruption
are riveting the public's attention.  Page 2</P>
<P><B>BOLIVIA</B>  &#167;   The creation of the much-vaunted private pension
system that will be financed by privatization assets  and private contributions
is on track to make its debut. Congress is discussing the rules that will govern
the system and an international search is underway to find two pension fund
administrators with global experience.  &#167;  The draft rules for the new
pension scheme draw from the Chilean model. Page 3</P>
<P><B>BRAZIL</B>  &#167;   The government has come up with a bailout plan for
the troubled state banks. The $8 billion package  will provide impetus for
consolidations and liquidations and will also give the government a handle on a
sector that has been both politically and economically troublesome.  &#167; 
Eletrobras is taking steps to deal with expected electricity shortages.  &#167; 
Two power privatizations have been halted pending a corruption investigation. 
Page 4</P>
<P><B>CHILE</B>  &#167;   The upcoming privatization of the Colbun hydro
facility has settled into a six-way race among  heavyweight utilities from the
US and Europe. The sale is the last of government's big electricity sell offs. 
&#167;  Carlos Massad, an old hand at central bank duties, will take over
leadership of that institution.  Page 5</P>
<P><B>COLOMBIA</B>  &#167;   President Samper faces a major new headache in
the contentious war on drugs. Now peasant coca  growers are demonstrating their
outrage at crop fumigations, one of the feeble efforts the administration can
point to as it tries to convince the US to hold off on trade sanctions.  &#167; 
Latest statistics show a slowing economy, growing unemployment and rising
inflation.  &#167;  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya will acquire a 40% stake in Banco
Ganadero, Colombia's largest bank.  Page 6</P>
<P><B>CUBA</B>  &#167;   More disheartening news seems in store for Cuba as
the country contemplates an uphill struggle in the  face of the Helms-Burton
bill to gather new credits for the next sugar planting. A brand new remodeled
office building may have difficulty finding tenants and major new hotel
investment is drying up.  &#167;  New legislation encouraging companies to set
up free zone operations is in place.  Page 7</P>
<P><B>ECUADOR  </B> &#167;   President Bucaram gave a New York audience a
rundown of his economic program but failed to  assuage doubts that the policies
he embraces &#150; lower interest rates and higher social spending &#150; would
work to lift the economy.  Bucaram did ally himself to privatization and avowed
deep interest in attracting foreign investment.  &#167;   The economic program
is loaded with goals, some of them contradictory.  Page 8</P>
<P><B>MEXICO</B>  &#167;   The economic recovery is progressing steadily and
at a stronger pace than initially forecast by the  government. Accelerating
growth in industry, trade and construction, and an improving profits picture for
companies support the belief that a revised target of 4% plus growth for this
year is feasible.  &#167;  The Bank of Mexico is out buying dollars under a
formula designed not to rock the market. Page 9</P>
<P><B>VENEZUELA</B>  &#167;   The threat of a US ban on air traffic from
Venezuela is the latest upshot from a dispute over  lax air safety that has
already caused a major disruption of traffic and put another blot on the
country's image. Venezuela now has just 30 days to comply with US standards.  &#167;
 Labor will have nothing to do with a proposal that would cut through the
stalemate on severance payments.  Page 10</P>

<H3>Bidders Sought To Launch Private Pension Fund System</H3>
<P>With capitalization well advanced, the government is moving ahead on its
goal to create a new pension fund system based on the retained assets of the
former state companies and on private contributions of individual workers.
Legislation to regulate the new two-tier system is currently under consideration
in congress and efforts are underway to appoint the two pension fund admin
istrators (AFPs) that will share responsibility for man aging the system. </P>
<P><B>Experience Counts.</B> Ernst &amp; Young and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell
are the two advisers managing the search for the AFPs. A road show is now
underway to attract qualified operators and some 39 firms have already expressed
interest. To make it to the short list, bidders must meet the tough
qualifications set by the ministry of capitalization. These include 20 years'
experience in portfolio management with at least 10 years and $10 billion in
international/global asset management and 10 years' experience administering
participant pension accounts. The international exper ience criteria has been
established because Bolivia lacks a capital market, and therefore 50% of the
pension fund monies are to be invested overseas. </P>
<P>Bids are due by November 20, and the winners will be announced January 1.
The two winning bidders will manage an equal split of the capitalization
proceeds, expected to reach $1.4 billion from the anticipated sale of six state
enterprises. So far four properties have been sold, but only the electric
holding company ENDE and the telecommunications concern ENTEL have yielded
significant amounts &#150; over $800 million. Shares of both companies, which
are being held in trust by Citibank until the new pension scheme is set up, are
already pay ing dividends. The next big privatization is that of oil company
YPFB, now scheduled for September. The AFPs will also manage funds contributed
to individual accounts.</P>
<P><B>Chilean Conundrum</B>. Some 21 of the 39 prospective AFP bidders are
from the US, but stiff competition is expected from Dutch, British, German,
Spanish, Japanese, Argentine, Canadian and Chilean firms. The Chileans appear to
face somewhat tougher obstacles considering President Sanchez de Lozada's vow
that Chilean AFPs will not be allowed to bid. The president apparently had
sought to avoid the controversy that followed the purchase of the state railway
Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles (ENFE) by the Chilean rail operator Cruz
Blanca (LL 4/26/96). </P>
<P><B>Mixed Signals. </B>The president later qualified his opposition to the
Chileans, explaining that none would be able to meet the prequalification
condition requiring international experience in asset management. However, the
minister of capitalization Alfonso Revollo down played the president's comments,
saying Chilean investors were welcome to bid for the AFPs and that no one would
be excluded. Meanwhile prospective Chilean bidders appear not to be discouraged.
The Magister fund, operated by the teachers' union, Provida and Aetna's Santa
Maria funds plan to enter alliances with foreign companies that meet bidding
terms.</P></TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP" WIDTH="300">
<P><B>Homegrown Team Wants A Place.</B> The Bolivian private sector also has
its beef with the government AFP plan, particularly after the national secretary
for capitalization Edgar Saravia said international AFP bidders were not obliged
to associate with Bolivian interests. Saravia was later contradicted by the
national secretary for pensions Alfonso Penam. Two local con cerns are expected
to make bids. One is a consortium headed by Jose Luis Camacho, president of the
Confederacion de Empresarios Privados de Bolivia (CEPB). The group includes 82
companies and indiv iduals. The other is headed by Gonzalo Bedoya, president of
Bolivia's largest insurance company, La Boliviana Cia. Cruz. Bedoya's group
includes Banco Nacional, Banco Mercantil and Banco de Santa Cruz. </P>
<P>The winning bidders will exclusively manage the pension fund monies for five
years, when the market will be opened up to other competitors. While analysts
complain about the lack of competition with just two AFPs, the government says
this rule is necessary to keep down the costs of establishing a national
presence. </P>
<H3>HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PENSION RULES</H3>
<P>The draft legislation under which the AFPs will operate is modeled on the
successful 15-year-old Chilean system. The new private system will ultimately
replace Bolivia's own crippled state program within the next 20 years. New
workers entering the work force will have to join the private system while the
current system will continue to offer pensions at a retirement age of 50 for
women and 55 for men until the last beneficiary dies. </P>
<P>The collective pension scheme based on the capital ization of state assets
will offer a basic pension of $200 a year to an estimated 3.7 million people
aged 21 and over on December 31, 1995 when they retire at 65. This scheme is
also expected to be phased out, probably around 2055. All the privatized state
company shares held by the scheme will then be sold on the open market. </P>
<P>The individual pension plan will provide retiree, dis ability and survivor
benefits. Enrollment is limited to employees earning over $100 a month and who
can afford the minimum 10% of earnings requirement. Critics say the plan
unfairly excludes an estimated 1 million peasants and 400,000 urban workers. But
it is unlikely that these workers would be willing to participate anyway
considering their low wages. Contributions from this group would also create a
costly administrative burden.</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
