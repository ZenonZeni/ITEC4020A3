<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">CIS Robotics, Ltd., Exclusive Canadian-Market Reseller for
PC-Based Robotic Simulation Systems</H2>
<P><B>Fort Myers , FL </B>(November 7, 1995):  Robotic Workspace Technologies,
Inc., of Fort Myers, Florida, announced that CIS Robotics, Ltd., of Windsor,
Ontario, Canada, has been selected as the exclusive Canadian-market reseller for
the company's WORKSPACE&#174; simulation software.  WORKSPACE, the first fully
functional personal computer-based robotic simulation software package, is user
friendly, mouse driven, and even speaks the robot's native language.</P>
<P> &quot;We took the better part of a year to select a company to serve the
Canadian market,&quot; said Walter K. Weisel, President and CEO of the
Florida-based RWT.  &quot;The sheer size and importance of the Canadian market
dictated that we choose a firm with outstanding technical expertise backed by
strong management experience.  We found both and more in CIS.&quot;</P>
<P> CIS, an international robotics integration and systems simulation source,
provides a full range of automation services, from robotic application
engineering and support for start-up and development to simulation and robot
programming services.  CIS provides robotic signature services in the users'
facilities; the company also has laboratory facilities to demonstrate the
accuracy, quality and productivity increases offered by WORKSPACE products.  As
an added bonus, CIS personnel are multi-skilled, so site expenditures are
typically lower.</P>
<P> Mark Bevins, President and CEO of CIS said, &quot;We now have the ability
to prove out the feasibility of robotic workcells before we commit to hardware,
something the industry has needed for years.&quot;  In addition, the WORKSPACE
simulation system allows CIS to assure their customers of decreased time and
reduced labor costs when they launch robots.</P>
<P> CIS serves a host of major manufacturers in the automotive industry,
including Chrysler (Canada and U.S.), Ford (Canada and U.S.), and General Motors
(Canada and U.S.).</P>
<P>
WORKSPACE is a revolutionary simulation software system that:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>runs on a personal computer (PC), including a notebook;
</LI>
<LI>provides 3D graphical simulation of any existing or proposed robotic
system;</LI>
<LI>combines robotic workcell simulation, off-line programming and on-line
calibration in one seamless piece of software.</LI></UL>
<P>&quot;CIS concentrates its work in the industrial robotic simulation and
robot programming support business,&quot; said Weisel.  &quot;The firm's
existing relationships with North American heavy-equipment installers coupled
with their in-plant experience made them the ideal choice for this business
relationship.  We couldn't have designed a better match.&quot; </P>
