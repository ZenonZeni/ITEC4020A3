Turning: A Sampling of the Array of Options

<FONT SIZE="-1">
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
&quot;Do more. Do it faster. Assure the accuracy. <BR>And don't forget about floorspace requirements.&quot; Sound familiar? <BR>If so, and parts turning is your bailiwick, here's a sampling of equipment that may make your job a whole lot easier.<I>GSV</I>

Doing More.
</H2>
<P>&quot;Multi-tasking&quot; is the name of the game for those who are looking for the means by which they can: assure part accuracy, reduce lead times, cut fixturing costs, and minimize work-in-process (WIP) inventory. The approach is simple. Setup a part on a machine and do <I>lots</I> of work on it. Since there aren't multiple fixturings, there are fewer opportunities for things to slip out of tolerances. Fewer fixtures means reduced costs. And because work is being done by a single machine, there's not as great a need to have WIP. One company that's concentrating on supplying 
multi-tasking-capable machinery is <A HREF="/mazak/index.html">Mazak Corp.</A> (Florence, KY). An excellent example is its Integrex 50Y, a turn/mill center. Although it has the fundamental configuration of a turning machine (e.g., it has a horizontally oriented 40-hp turning spindle motor that provides up to 2,270 ft-lb of torque and speeds of 3,000 rpm) and can do the expected turning and facing operations, it is equipped with a 15-hp spindle motor for live tools, so it can mill, drill and tap parallel and perpendicular to the spindle centerline. (Off-center line work is facilitated by an optional <I>Y</I>-axis that has &#177;4.1-in. travel.). The result: it can even machine box-shaped parts. It has a two-position 90&#176; indexing turret that handles fixed and rotating tools--and fairly big ones, as in boring bars up to 3.74 in. in diameter, 17.52-in. in length, and 44-lb mass. Equipped with an optional gantry robot, part conveyor, and automatic chuck jaw changer, this is not only multi-tasking, but lights-out working. 

<P>
<H2>
<I>Spindle Handling.</I>
</H2>
<P>Move the part rather than the tools on a vertical chucking machine. It allows the elimination of other part-handling devices for machine load/unload when the spindle does the work. That's a principle of the V300 from Index Corp. (Shelton, CT). The 79-hp spindle is inverted, with the chuck and workpiece on the lower end. The cutting tools are 
below it, stationary. The spindle can handle workpieces up to 5.5 in. in diameter. The travel of the spindle is 590 in. X 
and 13.38 in. Z. And traverse rates are quick: 1,181 ipm 
<I>X</I> and 1,574 ipm <I>Z</I>. Tooling can be gang-style or 
turret-mounted (including live tools with a 10-hp, 6,000-rpm drive). There is also the possibility of incorporating special, dedicated equipment right in the machine, such as laser welding or induction hardening. 

<P>
<H2>
<I>A Hard Base.</I>
</H2>
<P>When the turning is tough, the machine had best be solid. So the PredatorPlus from Monarch Machine Tool (Sidney, OH), which is equipped with a 4,000 rpm spindle that provides its 20 hp even at 500 rpm with 215 ft-lb of torque, has cast-iron base, headstock, tailstock, carriage, and turret slide to handle the demands of heavy cutting. The chuck is 10 in. It is also equipped with a 7.5-hp AC motor to drive drills, mills, taps, and other tools, thereby providing machining center-like capabilities. Another version of the machine, the Predator Y-40, provides <I>Y</I>-axis movement of the turret &#177;1.57 in. (or 40 mm) from the centerline of the turret so this secondary cutting is enhanced. 

<H2>
<I>Historic &amp; New.</I>
</H2>
<P>The brand name &quot;Acme Gridley&quot; is almost synonymous with the multi-spindle automatic bar and chucking 
machine. But while it is venerable, National Acme (Cleveland, OH) is also staying up with the times, as in the 1-1/4-in. HP-6 multiple spindle automatic with a spindle carrier system that provides up to 5,000 rpm. It features 25-hp thermally stable, preloaded tapered roller bearing spindle that helps improve machining tolerances, which are said to be 50% closer than those provided by previous-generation Acme Gridleys. Control is CNC (either Allen-Bradley or GE Fanuc). Slides--both two- and single-axis types--travel at 600 ipm and repeat within 0.0001 in. The stock reel accommodates 12-ft bar stock. The fiberglass sound enclosure keeps the sound level to 80 dba. 

<P>
<H2>

<I>Speed Centers.</I>
</H2>
<P>Getting things done quickly is something that is being emphasized by the people at Hitachi Seiki U.S.A. (Itasca, IL). For example, they maintain that their HiTec Turn 20SIII and 23SIII turning centers--which were designed and are built 
in Alabama--are the fastest two-axis machines available. Specs include: 0 to 5,000 rpm in less than 2.5 seconds (the 
top end for the 23SIII is 3,600 rpm); bi-directional turrets that index face to face in 0.1 second; rapids of 984 ipm 
<I>X</I> and 1,181 ipm <I>Z</I> with 0.1 acc/dec rates. The 20SIII has 15.7-in. of Z travel and an 8-in. chuck. The 23SIII has 24.8 in. <I>Z</I> and a 10-in. chuck. Standard and optional features help boost speed. For example, a patented device calculates offsets and enters them into the controller in less than a minute. The one-touch tailstock goes into position in 10 seconds. A quick-change chuck permits changing three jaws in 1 minute. All in all, it is estimated that setups can be made in 20 minutes rather than the two hours it might otherwise require. 

<P>
<H2>
<I>Done In One.</I>
</H2>
<P>Precision turning, boring, and contouring in a single chucking--and no secondary operations--in continuous production. That's the word on the 1070 horizontal turning center from Olofsson Corp. (Lansing, MI). Features that make this possible on this two-axis machine are a rigid, thermally stable column; slide repeatability of 0.00002 in.; the ability to handle slide thrust of 933 lb., and a 25-hp spindle motor. The machine has a chuck swing of 18 in.; the 
<I>X-</I> and <I>Z-</I>travels are 6 and 14 in., respectively. Parts 12 in. in diameter or 12-in. long can be handled. The machine is designed with a compact footprint: 114-in. wide, 90-in. deep and 96-in. high. Control is provided by an Allen-Bradley 9 Series CNC. 

<P>
<H2>
<I>Cool Operator.</I>
</H2>
<P>A machine that runs for a long time tends to get hot, which can result in thermal distortion. So to permit running 
for hour after hour, the headstock casting of the powerpath 15 CNC late from Bridgeport Machines (Bridgeport, CT) 
is designed so that thermal stability is maintained. The machine, which has a 35&#176; slant bed design, is equipped with a 15-hp AC variable speed spindle motor. Running through a two-range programmable speed automatic gear box, it provides torque ranges from 15 to 1,500 rpm and 45 to 4,500 rpm. The lathe has a 2-in. bar capacity and 17.32-in. swing. Travels: 21.26-in. <I>Z</I> and 7.28-in. <I>X</I>. There's a 12-station tool turret. Control is provided by the Bridgeport PC-based DX-32 control. 

<P>
<H2>
<I>Flexible &amp; Rigid.</I>
</H2>
<P>Four axes of controlled motion--yes, a subspindle is involved here--are offered by the puma 20BMS from Daewoo Machinery Corp. (Carlstadt, NJ). The high-torque main spindle is rated at 20-hp; it provides adjustable speeds up to 6,000 rpm. The subspindle is driven by an automatically synchronized 7.5-hp motor. The machine, which is based 
on a rigid 45&#186; casting, is equipped with a 12-station turret that can handle live tools at six stations. The swing over the bed is 20 in. and the turning length is 15.6 in. The 
<I>Z</I>-axis rapid rate is 1,024 ipm.
