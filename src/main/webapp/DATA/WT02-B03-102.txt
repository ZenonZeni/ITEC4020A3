<h3>The Treatment</h3>



<p>Thirteen glasses daily of various fresh raw juices prepared hourly

from organically grown fruits and vegetables.

<p>Three full vegetarian meals, freshly prepared from organically grown

vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.



<p><h4>Individual medications including:</h4>

<pre>

    a.  potassium compound,

    b.  thyroid hormone,

    c.  Lugol's Solution

    d.  injectable crude liver extract with B-12,

    e.  pancreatic enzymes,

    f.  enemas of coffee and/or chamomile tea,

    g.  castor oil

</pre>



<p>The Gerson Therapy is an intensive, nutrition-based, medical

treatment. It works closely with nature to help the sick body to rid

itself of disease through the supportive effects of simple foods,

juices, and non-toxic medication.



<p><h4>The main features of the diet are:</h4>

<pre>

    1) sodium restriction,

    2) potassium supplementation,

    3) extreme fat restriction,

    4) periodic (temporary) protein restriction,

    5) high vitamin,

    6) high mineral,

    7) fluid rich,

    8) high micronutrient.

</pre>

<p>Although the diet allows for some cooked foods, emphasis is placed on

the consumption of unaltered foods.  Fresh, raw fruits and vegetables

are the source materials of all micronutrients in their pristine

organic composition.  Beyond supplying adequate quantities of all

known nutrients, the use of specific raw fruits and vegetables and

their juices ensures that patients receive even those health

promoting factors not yet appreciated by science.



<p>Medications used in the Gerson Therapy are classed as biologicals,

materials of organic origin which are found in the body and are

supplied in therapeutic amounts.



<p>An important treatment employed as part of the Gerson Therapy is

frequent detoxification of tissues and blood by coffee enemas which

cause stimulation of enzyme systems of the gut wall and liver and

promote excretion of toxic bile.
