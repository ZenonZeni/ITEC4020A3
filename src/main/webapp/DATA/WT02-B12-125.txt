 Bob Metcalfe on Clipper <p>

CLIPPER CHIP OPPOSITION
InfoWorld publisher Bob Metcalfe states in a Wall Street Journal op-ed
piece that he is against Clipper Chip technology, but for different reasons
than those cited by the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Rather
than getting steamed up about the right to privacy issue, which he notes
was always a conditional right anyway, Metcalfe says, "I am against Clipper
simply because it will not work, and it will cost an unnecessary amount of
tax money to outfit government computers with the chips." Even if Clipper
were built into every computer and phone system, "smart criminals can
easily get around Clipper by using additional encryption. Stupid criminals
will continue to do stupid things and get caught." (Wall Street Journal
