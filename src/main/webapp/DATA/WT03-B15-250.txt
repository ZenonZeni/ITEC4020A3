<center><h2>GEOGRAPHICAL LIMITS</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>AREA 1 Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Republic of South Africa.<br>
AREA 2  Worldwide excluding USA and Canada.</h3></center>
<p>
<b>NB: the selected geographical area should be based on the country in which the insured person is a resident and not the country for which a passport is held.</b>
<p>
<center><h2>BUDGET PLAN</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to £100,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to £10,000</b>
<p>
Covers costs and expenses incurred whilst in the overseas country of residence. This plan is ideally suited to those persons who are temporarily based overseas and/or have family who remain in the country for which passports are held but in any event for those persons who have continued to pay national/state contributions or who have medical expense arrangements in the country for which they hold a passport. This is an important aspect of the Budget Plan as when medically necessary an injured or sick person will be compulsorily repatriated. Repatriation shall be deemed necessary if a qualified medical practitioner:- 1) estimates that hospitalisation shall be in excess of four weeks and/or 2) certifies that recovery will be substantially expedited thereby.
<p>
Following repatriation medical expense reimbursement shall cease under this plan. If however a full recovery is made during the period of cover, as certified by a qualified medical practitioner, this plan shall pay the cost of one way economy class transportation back to the insured person's overseas country of residence whereupon coverage may be reinstated.
<p>
<center><h2>STANDARD PLAN</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to £500,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to £15,000</b>
<p>
Cover as BUDGET PLAN but including costs and expenses incurred anywhere in the selected geographical area (excluding the country for which a passport is held). Compulsory repatriation is not a condition of cover under the STANDARD PLAN.
<p>
<center><h2>SUPER PLAN</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Coverage per person MEDICAL EXPENSES up to £1,000,000 PERSONAL ACCIDENT up to £20,000</b>
<p>
