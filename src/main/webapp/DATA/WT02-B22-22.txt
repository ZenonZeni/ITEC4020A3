<!-- FIELD:CMT_MYSEX -->
<LI>pretty good
<LI>It's all a matter of free speech and expression.  Let Parents regulate not the government!
<LI>i like it
<LI>It's good
<LI>It's had better days.  I don't like this scensorship.
<LI>i enjoy sex on the internet its fun and easy to recieve
<LI>too many sites which have no other goal other than to make money. This is turning sex into a commodity which is far more morally degrading that the content.
<LI>How I learn to use??
<LI>I think its great!!!
<LI>I thinkthat people shopuld be able to put up and read whatever sexual materials they want
<LI>There is more out there for men than there is for women to enjoy.  
<LI>I think it is a very good thing!
<LI>America needs a healthier outlook on sex.  Any "witch hunt" by government officials should be put down immediately.  If anything, truly democratic surveys (perhaps such as this one) should deem what is or isn't appropriate.
<LI>Life and let live guys and gals, but try to be honest in what you do.
<LI>I think that it's stupid for people to try and have internet sex. But, everyone is entitled to do as s/he wishes.
<LI>OK
<LI>wonderful resource
<LI>i like it a lot
<LI>i think it is good 
<LI>I like it!
<LI>still exploring
<LI>I think sex and the internet go hand in hand!
<LI>I love it.
<LI>over-rated
<LI>What's with the scantily-clad women? where are the pictures of men? 
<LI>I love it. It's a stress reliefer in my opinion!
<LI>Leave it alone. People need to make their own decisions. I do not want to pay taxes for the government to make everyone decisions for them!
<LI>it's fine
<LI>Useful
<LI>Too public. Disapprove. Too much access for minors.
<LI>it's great
<LI>this is america land of the free !
<LI>Please keep the government out!
<LI>I like to see pictures.
<LI>i like to peruse all content at my discretion
<LI>No comment
<LI>It's a great way to communicate your sexual desires...
<LI>I think it has it's value.
<LI>Love sex, can not get enough and want to be able to contact someone to talk to without strings attached.
<LI>its there if you want it. but so are books!and drugs,if you want it you will find and get it.
<LI>i like it. i've never heard of anyone being "Net-Raped"
<LI>great
<LI>It is impossible to stop so sit back & enjoy it
<LI>I think for adults its find but keep it away from kids
<LI>Not much is know yet, it's too new, and can go many ways...
<LI>tamura@legno.interzone.or.jp
<LI>Much of it is sick.  I can't believe the number of freaks that use computers.
<LI>I've not found anything really "offensive".  Its been a lot of fun and if anything is really offensive to you you can always "squelsh" them.
<LI>I think that parents need to monitor their children, and let the rest of us RESPONSIBLE ADULTS choose for ourselvs.  I also believe that the government should not censor things that special interest groups don't find to be politically correct. 
<LI>I think Republican blowhards should raise their kids, not mine.
<LI>I don't think it is doing anybody any good,  it's not going to hurt them if they can not acess it.  And you would protect the people who really should not see the stuff.
<LI>I think the flirting is fun and it really is no harm if you don't give out your real information.  There are alot of uptight people in this world who have nothing better to do except bitch about others. If their kids are smart enough to use a computer, then they should know when they're doing soething against their parents wishes.  Besides, the parents are probably looking at it too when the kids aren't there...
<LI>Phew!
<LI>THE INTERNET SHOULD BE AN OPEN AND HONEST FORM OF COMMUNICATION
<LI>easier to by a mag...
<LI>I use it
<LI>I think it is ridiculous for the govt to try to take over for parents. Kids have "access" to pornography at newstands, and they should be monitored by THEIR PARENTS!
<LI>I love it
<LI>WICKED
<LI>it is something that is there for ppl who want it others should shut the hell up if they do not like it and get a life
<LI>not enough of it
<LI>Sex rules
<LI>i think there is no problem we are all adults and have a right to look and do what we want on a certain level, i am against child porn and all that garbage but what is between a man and a woman or two consenting adults is their business others don't have to contribute
<LI>It is part of the world it sould be part of the net
<LI>Not much to say, really...
<LI>I think there should be more oppenness about sex, period. There isn't enough sex on the internet as is. How can people sensor it?! MORE SEX!!!!
<LI>I think it give people a chance to see other things, while being anonymous.  In a society that looks at people for what they are rather than who they are, this anonymousness is very improtant to devlopment.
<LI>This is a free country and everyone of age should have the right to it.
<LI>Like anything, the Internet can be a haven for explorations and informations if it is not misued.
<LI>I run an adult web site so of course I like it :) http://www.xsource.com   Nice pic (bottom of this survey page)
<LI>i think internet its a free net...sex on the net... why not?
<LI>yes
<LI>I feel that if an adult feels the need to explore the realm of sex on the internet, have fun.  But keeping a strict guiadance on underage children is very important. 
<LI>Sex should be a part of the internet to be viewed by consenting adults
<LI>The regulation of sex on the internet by state, local, and governmental entities should be considered nothing less than censorship, and is not appropriate
<LI>I think that if people want to look at, read about, and post sexually explicite material on the net the should be alowed to.
<LI>There should be more free viewing costing nothing
<LI>i believe that it is beneficial to some, but in other respects it has been damaging i.e. children having access and those who become addicted to sex and the net.
<LI>male
<LI>Great!
<LI>I Think sex on the Internet is fine, actually I enjoy some of the things I have come across. And find some things, though not for me, interesting. But I do think that Web Sites should be "Net Nanny" capable. There are some things I have come across that I don't think younger children should have access to.
<LI>love it!!!!
<LI>GREAT
<LI>Likely to become more regulated
<LI>Okay, I think.  It doesn't seem to be obtrusive.
<LI>i think that if it is entertainment for some people, then so be it, that is their decision.  i am not turned on by it, but i don't see why someone else shouldn't have access to it if they want...
<LI>I think it is great, the internet should have everything.  I am an adult and know what I am doing.
<LI>it's great
<LI>for people who wish to engage them selves in things like this it is wonderful, for me personally i think it is pathetic and demeaning!
<LI>Much ado about nothing
<LI>It has helped repression...
<LI>I do accidently run into it occassionally, however I'm not offendned.  It should be monitored to a degree for others who stumble upon it.  It some type of rating system were assigned then you can view what you liked at your leisure and not worry about children or other stumbling upon graphics or stories that don't interest them.
<LI>fucked up
<LI>mostly a waste of energy
<LI>It's hard to find, and most of what I have found is in the form of teasers for a pay service.
<LI>Bestiality rules
<LI>I think that more parents ought to have a password and watch their children if they don't wish them to view .
<LI>Not the governments responsibility-parents should raise there own children!!!!!
<LI>I think sex on the inernet is great, It keeps me company when i'm lonely.  It is safer than going out and finding these things on the street.  It is much safer and you can do it in the comfort of your own home!
<LI>More stories "articles" to teach people to be more open. 
<LI>I think its good only for people with open minds.  Anyone who can't take it don't look at it.  Its that simple.
<LI>huh...
<LI>It's GREEEEEAAAAAAATT
<LI>sex is a natural thing if two people no matter how they engage feel good ,thats the best thing
<LI>very interesting but takes too long to find any good pictures.
<LI>Safe release of perversity.
<LI>more locals on chatline; more hardcore porn sites
<LI>i want to see more dick sucking and ass licking.
<LI>I think that it is just great.
<LI>I wish it was easir to find it !!!?
<LI>I wish there were more...
<LI>I'm curious, simply that.
<LI>I think it is good, healthy and should be easily accessed by those who want it.
<LI>it rules
<LI>everybody in the world should f**k eachother every day\night
<LI>i dont think there is anything wrong with it. its a form of expresion
<LI>No child access to the internet.  Parents responsible.  Prudes prosecuted for denying other adults their constitutional rights.
<LI>nobigdeal
<LI>I am able to see things that I probably wouldn't see elsewhere.
<LI>I think it is great
<LI>i want to know more.
<LI>It is not as bad as it made out.  People of age should be allowed to decide what they want.
<LI>I think that parents should monitor their children's participatation with sex on the internet
<LI>I feel that it is very over rated and we should consider that we have more interesting things to learn and do to make this a better place to live.
<LI>its dumb to have sex on the internet when you can just go to your girlfriends house and bang her
<LI>Whatever gets you through your life,it's alright. It's no different than violence on T.V.. If you don't want it, don't request it or turn it off, but don't tell me what I can or cannot watch or participate in, so long as it doesn't hurt anyone, or breach any laws.   
<LI>i love to look at hardcore fucking
<LI>the net is just the world we live in be it electronic or not
<LI>I feel that parents have the ultimate responsibility in monitoring what their children see.  I also have always been proud to be an American where there is freedom of speech.  As adults, we are able to decide what we do and do not wish to see, just like television, if you don't like it, turn the channel.
<LI>I feel that adults have the right to view what they choose-however I myself would like to see a lot less hard and deviant areas on the Net.
<LI>I think regulation of sex is an excuse for monitoring the Internet for other reasons. Newagents are much worse.
<LI>i think sex is fun and should be enjoyed by anyone who wants to.
<LI>I believe the new communications bill is unconstitutional.
<LI>I enjoy the sex on the net, and believe that if you want to see anything of your chosing you have the right
<LI>i live in liberal-minded finland and i really can't understand the US governments new laws. i always thought YOU were the land of the free etc. now it looks more like united soviet states.
<LI>The government has no right to regulate.  Also, I've read many articles promoting safe sex.  This is a good thing!
<LI>It's great
<LI>I feel that sex belongs between two married individuals.  It does not belong in stores, in the movies and certainly not on the Internet.  Part of the problem in America today is that we are teaching our children whatever feels good do.  The family unit is becoming a rarity and as you can see by the numbers this has given us a high crime rate, divorce rate, sucide rate, and look at the diseases that are killing our children.  Maybe if everyone took the time to be more responsible for what they bring to 
he net it would clean itself up.
<LI>Sex is what you make it.  Celibacy is it's own punishment.
<LI>Sensorship is an extension of the desire to control others.
<LI>I'm not a avid "looker", but occasionally it's amusing.
<LI>Should be harder to come by for the youth.
<LI>I think it sucks to have to pay for it all.
<LI>Sex is ok as long as you use good judgement and have selective sexual partners.  I am married, have had sex with at least 3 different women younger than me and this is while I am married.  One just has to be disciplined and to have the ability to use good
<LI>The access should be restricted, but no other regulations.
<LI>I believe that we need to educate our children on the sex and internet issue.  It is part of us.  It is only natural for us to enjoy sex.  Its one of Gods greatest gifts.  We teach it openly in our home.  Its not looked upon as sinful but as a beautiful gift to be enjoyed.  Education needs to be taught - not censorship.
<LI>I think software manufacturers should perfect products which will allow parents to set up controls to monitor what sites their children have been to and to block certain sites from their access
<LI>Open forum for people to express their sexual preferences and communicate with others without inhibition.
<LI>It is an expression of our free society
<LI>I think the government should start worrying about some real problems like the economy maybe.  I think the finances of our counrty are a little more important than people jerking off on the net.  Give me a break!
<LI>There is a lot of "dead-ends" which are previously thought to be sex related.
<LI>ok
<LI>I had a few 'hot' moments with people in chat rooms.  It's a bit of a laugh really.
<LI>It is very interesting how everybody is so worried about the porn on the net. Granted, childeren should not see it, but they should also not see pages with violent content and nobody seems to care about that! Also, if there is one thing I hate, then it is
<LI>where is it?
<LI>No interest at all.
<LI>it rocks
<LI>internet is last haven of free speech on the planet
<LI>where the hell is it????
<LI>ok, could be better
<LI>To be able to access sexuall content on the net is better than going out into public and asking about it from someone else. I think it should stay!!!
<LI>interesting.
<LI>keep it on,you can see it in movies on the street etc.
<LI>its great
<LI>I would like to find someone with whom i could have a sexual relationship with. The net may allow me to do so.
<LI>I think sex is an integral part of human life, and nothing anyone does will ever change that.  As the Internet becomes part of human life also, sex will be there.
<LI>Its Good
<LI>There should be minimal, if at all, regulation..parents should monitor their kids activity. It is a global concept and no one nation should be able to impose it's law or moral code on others. 
<LI>Don't know yet -- new to the net
<LI>I don't care.  There are far more fascinating, not to mention worthwhile, things on the 'net.
<LI>good
<LI>Too Soon To Tell
<LI>Not much out there,  you have to pay for everything.
<LI>I think that it is good, it promotes safer sex and people have open conversations about it.
<LI>I don't have a problem with sex on the internet.  It should be letf up to each person if they choose to access sexual material on the internet.
<LI>Doesn't really bother me.  I don't look for it, therefore, I don't have to see it.
<LI>Too much for pay.  Would like to see more open forums.
<LI>It's just like sex everywhere else, it's there it's always gonna be there it's part of life.
<LI>i like
<LI>keep it sensual but in good taste
<LI>COOL
<LI>i think it's a very heathy way of expressing hidden desires, and appeasing curiosity towards 'taboo' subjects---i commend you!
<LI>it's fun, but in small letters
<LI>mmmmmmmm
<LI>Would like to see more.
<LI>it's cool
<LI>it is fine with me aslong as the people using it are not to about the email adress and nameyoung. like i said earlier 
<LI> There are warnings before you can ever get to any porn sites. I feel it is the parents responsibility to watch their children!
<LI>Wish it was easier to find and get to!!
<LI>Parents need to moniter their kids. Adults should be able to do what they wish as long as no harm is caused to others. 
<LI>it seems fun
<LI>part of life, therefore part of the net :)
<LI>I find sex on the net very exciting, very stimulating
<LI>its great
<LI>I think it's a good idea and should not be forbidden.
<LI>I think that the pornographic area should be cut down but other than that it's alright
<LI>To damn hard to find
<LI>For most people, like my husband and myself, sex on the internet is just a novelty. We've both downloaded nudy pictures and browsed around some explicit web sites, but that's about it--no big deal if you ask me. I've seen worse stuff in direct mail catalo
<LI>Shows lots of examples of failures and what not to do.
<LI>sucks
<LI>Cool!!!
<LI>not very exiting
<LI>Damages computer keyboard.
<LI>I FEEL EVERYONE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET WHAT ONE IS LOOKING FOR WITH NO RESTRICTIONES
<LI>with good also comes bad.
<LI>children should'nt have access tp pornography on the net
<LI>not enough
<LI>Normal, fun, entertainment FOR ADULTS!
<LI>Very open communication. Easy to find diverse or special interests.
<LI>I think sex is good, I also think the internet is good. 
<LI>Why? Personal is a whole lot better!
<LI>derulate  it!
<LI>I think that the net should be left alone by the politians.  There are plenty of programs like Net Nanny, etc. to keep children out of sexually explicit sites and areas.  Also, parents need to be more vigilant about what their children are doing when logged on to a service or on the Internet.  A simple thing to do would be to establish a log-in password before you can even get into the computer.
<LI>SEX IS A NATURAL THING. IT SHOULLD BE VIEWED AS BEAUTIFUL,EXCITING. FUN THING FOR ALL ADULTS. IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT ALL ADULTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPENLY VIEW,  ENGAGE IN, DISCUSS, ETC.  PARENTS SHOULD BE THE CENSORS FOR THEIR CHILDREN UNTIL THEY ARE OF AN APPROPRIATE AGE.
<LI> I think it is grat
<LI>I think that parents should take more resposibility not the government
<LI>Sex, just like any other topic should be available on the net.  If the gov't censors sex then what is to stop them from censoring any other subject they choose profane.
<LI>Best thing on Earth
<LI>you can see sex not just in the net so wy not on the net its just a fantasi
<LI>sex is natural ,god did it
<LI>i really like sex on the net, i like to talk with people that have the same sexual fantasy as I do, and i like to talk to guys who have the same drive as i do, i am horny twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, and I can't get enough sex at home, so i turn to the computer.
<LI>I think that it can be bad if it's taken too far - but it can be fun too! You can't really interfere here, so to each his own.
<LI>I think that it is wonderful.  People should be able to express their sexual desires on the internet.  Everything else that you can possibly think of is on the net, why should sex not be?
<LI>Too much concern about the web. Don't know about chat lines.
<LI>I like looking at naked people, but it's kind of hard to do
<LI>The Internet is a mass of information where people can gain invaluable knowledge about anything and everything, there is nothing wrong with sex on the net, although I draw the line at kiddy porn, that is totally sick.  You can walk into a shop and purchase porn, so why not on the net, if parents/gaurdians are worried that their child may see this stuff then they should not le them on the net !!!
<LI>sex is limited !!
<LI>GREAT!
<LI>Good honest survey
<LI>need more!!
<LI>It seems to be a big waste of time.
<LI> ----
<LI>Good way to exchange pics ans ideas about specials phantasms
<LI>I realy enjoy sex on the net. It has opened my mind as well as my spouses. We  both enjoy sex on  the net and hope that futher restrictions are not placed upon it. We don;t have a credit card so we have to depend on open free material for or viewing pleasure.This is the main area I hope is not taken away.
<LI>This is very useful for all users
<LI>It's great. Need more channels on "personals" and individual interaction. Needs to easier to meet others with similar needs so meetings could occur. 
<LI>THE SURVEY IS TOO SHORT, I LIKE DETAIL. 
<LI>The time required to download makes it a drag
<LI>it's amazing the things that's out there for us to do.
<LI>It's good for those curious kids out there, better than getting AIDS
<LI>I think it's a great outlet for closet masterbaters.
<LI>I fell sexual related topics ought to be available on the net.  It is a great place to share differing viewpoints.
<LI>sucks
<LI>An Erotic New Way to enjoy one's own sexuality without inhibition!
<LI>Incredibly Great!
<LI>the government has no business regulating the net.
<LI>IT IS THE MOST WONDERFUL THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.  THERE IS NOTHING LIKE GETTING OFF WHILE TALKING TO A HOT HORNEY WOMAN
<LI>I think that it shouldn't be censored....I am trying to currently learn how to Masturbate, and the Internet helps me to let out sexual tension(if I can find any text explaining this...)
<LI>Its great and our right to view what we want
<LI>i think that it is great and that it should always be here.
<LI>I love it! I want some more of it!
<LI>I firmly believe in the BILL OF RIGHTS! I also belivev that sex should only be between a male and a female who are married.
<LI>not sure
<LI>it enables me to learn more about sex
<LI>It's everywhere, some of it quite disturbing. But as long as it does not break laws it should be left alone. Voltaire said something to the effect of I may disagree with what you are saying but I will die defending your right to say it. That is how I feel
<LI>It's hot and exciting.  It's a turn-on!
<LI>I like the idea of finding what interests you and contacting the places that you woud not ordinary find
<LI>Not bad
<LI>i think its a free country and what two aldults do is their right 
<LI>Sex on the internet is a way for people such as my self to look and listen without leaving their home and getting into trouble. i.e. I would like to see nude pictures of very young girls but would not dream of trying to see them in any real life situation. I am only fascinated by the thought of the taboo not the bullshit that pedophiles pull with minors. I am a on-line looker if I ever find some of these pix, otherwise I have no desire to see it.
<LI>If your looking for sex on the net you'll find it just like anything on the net that's why it's called the information highway, you can find anything, but the keyword is find/look
<LI>I don't pay any attention, and rarely encounter it
<LI>I think it is very educational and has helped my masturbating come alive at least once every other day.  thank you 
<LI>fun
<LI>its real good
<LI>I not sen soo much of sex, so i cant give any answer
<LI>There's too much rubbish stuff about sex online, not enough real erotica or pornography
<LI>i really dont think it is a problem. Its just a computer with words and imagase, but should be over 18 to veiw the sexual material
<LI>sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex sex
<LI>I think that sex should be allowed on the net provided there be some way of restricting  younger viewers.
<LI>I think it's a good way to get off (relax or have fun...)
<LI>let the user decide what to view
<LI>lots of fun-- makes me ready to leave the lab and go see my girlfriend
<LI>It is fun and exciting down loading a picture and waiting to see what it looks like
<LI>I enjoy it.
<LI>I LOVE SEX
<LI>interesting
<LI>I enjoy looking through it, and would be more involved if I had a access to the net through my home computer!
<LI>I like freedom
<LI>it shows me that "normalcy" in penis size, and body shapes, and peoples basic desires, have a much wider range of activities (hence within the norm), than Bob Dole would like us to believe.
<LI>Sex on the net is entertaning .
<LI>it is full of puritanism
<LI>As a female that was afraid that I was one of only a few women that wanted sew with another female yet remained married and in a fairly good hertero relationship, I was extremely pleased to find so many people on the net with similar feelings.  Yes, there are perverts on the net, but from my experience, there are truly some great people out there.  Thanks to who ever invented this safe way to get it on and to meet others of similar interests.
<LI>oh well it is the penthouse of the 1990's just like i first saw in the 1960's. the same scene just different more mature viewers. kids grow up faster and have more freedom
<LI>yee-hah!
<LI>Can't find anything "hardcore"
<LI>I would like to know more about it
<LI>SEEMS LIKE A HARMLESS WAY TO GET OFF.
<LI>I'm all for it
<LI>Its a blast
<LI>I think it's underrated, with the access that I have to it.
<LI>I don't mide sex on the net, but I do think that there should be a rating system and with this rating system you should need a pass word to access the porn material.  
<LI>It's cool ! Consenting adults should not be monitored or restricted. If you can't control what your kids watch or check out, maybe you should pay more atention to what they are doing !
<LI>It's no big deal, the computer like the television shouldn't be resbonsible for baby sitting children
<LI>Sex on the internet is for lonely souls who should reconsider the use of any hard-core sexual material.
<LI>its intersting
<LI>its fun and why not!!!
<LI>It should not be regulated in any way.  Control the reaction, not the act of observing.  Parents must prepare their kids for what's out there, not close their eyes to it.  Teach them to deal with reality, not hide from it.
<LI>They should show more to the public according to a system of pass words and confidential numbers.
<LI>I think it is wonderful.  I gives me the opportunity to meet people who share the same interests as I.
<LI>I think that it has answered a lot of my questions that I never wanted to ask other people about.  Sex should not be referred to as a bad thing but it should be discussed openly amoung people of different sexual orientations, age, and sexual background.
<LI>FUN FUN
<LI>It has been fun exploring sex on the net. As more experience is gained surffing, hopefully the sex will get better.
<LI>Well i like to find a site with good pics every once in a while just like any normal guy likes to flip thru a porno mag to look at the girlies. It gives me something to do in the slow parts of the workday. I dont think the government should have controll 
<LI>it rocks
<LI>The internet RULES!
<LI>wonderful
<LI>It has explained many questions I had. Improved my understanding of my personel sexualitty
<LI>just exploring
<LI>Inevitable.  The more attention is given to it, the more desire there will be for it too.
<LI>IT RULES
<LI>i like it
<LI>It rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I DON'T THINK IT SHOUL BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE!
<LI>Great!
<LI>I like to be on top
<LI>love it, gets out alot of frustration and curiosity
<LI>I don't have an opinion.  If some one wants to look at it that is their business.
<LI>It can be informative or it can promote 'perversion'.
<LI>I like it and I like it hard.
<LI>The best place to have sex is in the home, with your loving partner -- gitta real life cyberpeople!
<LI>I don't think it is an issue at all.
<LI>great
<LI>it's better to have it here, than having pron shops across the road  
<LI>Sex on the net is a good thing.
<LI>I think that it is a good that sexual matters can be discuss openly and without censor. The impact of children is probably an over concern. I doubt what they will see on the net is more corrupting than the mindless violence they see on the television. It has always amased me that it is Ok to should a man shooting a woman but not OK to see him pleasuring her.
<LI>No big deal. Here that, Newt? No big deal!
<LI>Cool
<LI>Great.  I've found much better erotica here than at any bookstore I'm willing to visit!
<LI>The net should have the same freedom of speech that any other mag./paper has.
<LI>I AM NEW TO THE NET. IT IS STILL HARD TO USE.
<LI>It's a double edged sword(OHH BABY!!!!)
<LI>No Comment
<LI>I Love BIG CHESTED BITCHES, WITH HAIRY CUNTS?
<LI>I think that it should be easier to find
<LI>nothing for free
<LI>GOD  Bless America!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Amen Brother!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>interesting...
<LI>I think it is ok the way it is and it should not be limited by any government intervention or service providers.
<LI>I think the internet COULD be a useful tool to help those who are curious about sex and who would like information about the subject. 
<LI>It's boring to me but anyone who's into it should have access, except for child pornagraphy. Free speech!
<LI>I prefer the real thing.
<LI>My wife and I learned some new techniques...We get "turned on" more...We now have sex every day!
<LI>I think it's the parent's responsibility to monitor children's activities.  If the government is allowed to regulate the net, it will infringe on our constitutional rights and set a dangerous precedent leading to an eventual "police state."
<LI>fuckin great until the feds fuck it up
<LI>I met my boyfriend on the net and i am totally in love so I am all for it!    =)
<LI>It has it's place.  After all, it is natural.  But let the user decide what is right.
<LI>Good but could be made easy for assess
<LI>I LIKE IT
<LI>a easy way to have fun without getting into trouble at a bar or with a strange dissease
<LI>amazing how prevalent..how much fun it all is
<LI>I think it is interesting, safe, and an outlet for many people who would not experience sex any other way.
<LI>Sex is a lot different than "making love" with someone. I like to explore areas and the Internet lets me do this in the privacy of my own home. However there are some people out there that use the Internet for more than curiosity, i.e. pedophiles.
<LI>im 58yr male married 28yr going on 50 enjoy surfing have sex w/wife 2-5 times wk, masturbate 3-5 times wk
<LI>IT'S A LITTLE TOO RACEY-ESPECIALLY IF A CHILD IS ON THE INTERNET 
<LI>I think the Internet is a great way for people to communicate about sex.
<LI>Sexuality on the net is less harmless than real sex.
<LI>I don't mind it at all.  I find it as a healthy output for sexual desire.  It has made me more open to new experiences.
<LI>exposure to other people's ideas
<LI>NOT ENOUGH OF IT! HARD TO FIND AUTOFALLATIO/FISTING ETC...GOOD SITE & PICTURES LIKE THAT!
<LI>sex is great, if you need the internet to get it(and if you are old enough)well then, take what you can!
<LI>The things I've seen made me terrified
<LI>I am curious, what is a future of that
<LI>Better than looking at dictionaries for stuff (joke)
<LI>fascinating, sorry to sound like spook.
<LI>Sex on the internet is great.I dont want it to go.
<LI>informative and there!!!!
<LI>The internet has helped me realize my sexuality - and has actually made me more comftorble (SP!) with some words i normally wouldent use... :)
<LI>Hey life is good!
<LI>not enough
<LI>In the short few months I have been here I have seen a lot of sites from graphic hard core to informative and useful. I like both and dont wish to see either go, however there should be some mandatory rating/ blocking system in place to protect those who are easily influenced (minors). This would include not only sexual sites but also some of the other materials which are unsuitable to minors. 
<LI>I think that it will be influential in electing Harry Browne of the Libertarian Party President in '96; if you fave no taxes and less government, check out http://www.HarryBrowne96.org/. 
<LI>Primitive
<LI>it's great.  Lot of good times.  'safe sex'
<LI>I don't know what the big hangup people have over sex is all about.  The way it's talked about in 'public' way too often is that it's a bad/dirty thing.  It's not.  COnsensual sex bewteen educated partners can be a wonderful thing.  I'd still much rather have my child hear talk of a sexual nature than hear of a murder...
<LI>Personally, I think that a person cannot, as I said in my last answer, it is virtually impossible to accidently run into sex online. I think that it is a personal issue that needs to be resolved within the home and not to be cheated out of a freedom because of the government.
<LI>It's my new greatest source of orgasm and pleasure
<LI>I do not know havent seen it.
<LI>It's Everywhere
<LI>Its not as good as the real thing! Thats for sure!
<LI>i like it
<LI>Sex on the interenet is good.
<LI>too many sites ask for money.
<LI>Not as good as the real thing, but better than nothing!
<LI>I'm not sex-mad, but I must admit it is something that I could not be without.  I'm married to a very open-minded, sexy woman but only see her for about 6 days a month due to my job, therefore I try to find ways of relieving my frustration. This I do by masturbating, a lot, I would like to see more free hard-core porn on the net, I realise that it would make it easier for children to view it, but it is up to parents to restrict their children.
<LI>but unless you're loose with the credit card, forget it!
<LI>it is cool
<LI>Swinging is what we are into,without our bbs it would be difficult
<LI>It is fine, just don't let children get to it.  It is a little too easy to access it.
<LI>it is TRASH
<LI>I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MOVIES SHOWN
<LI>interesting
<LI>I don't have a problem with sex and the Internet at all I think  it  is up to the parent s to watch out for what there kids are looking at.
<LI>I think pornography is cool.
<LI>nothing wrong with it as long no one try to put unrelated materials inside of the net.
<LI>It is a safe alternative to real life sex.... No AIDS to worry about while you are doing it.
<LI>it's interesting
<LI>I believe that it is just like buying a dirty magazine but there should be some way to protect the children
<LI>It's an outlet, more than anything else.  
<LI>Something should definitely be done to regulate it and the parents should be responsible for blocking sexually explicit sites.
<LI>I believe I have never even heard of sex on the internet
<LI>It has replaced expensive men's magazines.  I save money.
<LI>It can be entertaining and infiormative. It can also be very enlightening because it helps others get over the stigma that sex is unhealthy, evil or just palin dirty.
<LI>Nice to have the option!!!
<LI>I would like to see more, its fun.
<LI>It's OK
<LI>i think its stimulating, only problem is i realy dont know how to acsess sites properly nand end up mostly seeing nothing.
<LI>

<LI>Sex on the Internet is awesome and i want it to be more graphic, without a price, and so graphic that you could cum on the spot!Fuck everything!!!
<LI>I think that there should be a self-policing organization.
<LI>Children should be protected -- they are so vulnerable & abuse is so prevalent. 
<LI>It is a great resource and outlet. PARENTS, not the government, should regulate their children's access.
<LI>It is way overrated.  If you are not interested in it it is simple to avoid and easy enough to keep children out of it.  So let it be.
<LI>help stop the government's attack on the first admendment
<LI>love it
<LI>some are too much but in general,it's okay with me
<LI>I think parents can purchase Cyber Patrole to keep their children from viewing adult material.  Why should the rest of us be punished?  Why can't the government treat adults like adults and let us decide what to do about children accessing sex on the inte
<LI>FREEDOM OF SPEACH
<LI>Get rid the the damn child molestors, the loser beatiality pictures/movies/stories, and burn all of those F-CKING faggots
<LI>i think it's great that it's available to me but at the same time it shouldn't be available to anyone under 18.  kids have a hard enough time growing up to be infleuenced by porn
<LI>it is great and mind stimulating.
<LI>great
<LI>I think sex is fine. Personal taste and choice are the imperative words. When a person has reached the age of majority. let them decide for themselves. Frankly, more sex is shown and known about in the third grade than is shown on most sex sites.
<LI>WHY not!!!!
<LI>i love having sex, and i like x rated pictures and movies
<LI> I feel the internet is an extremely effective communications and educational tool. People today are researching an ever expanding palette of subjects , therefore any censorship of such aa all encompasing text ,a world-wide forum for information and feedb
<LI>sex is great and there are so many ways to express it.I am very broard minded however there are some sickos out there.
<LI>I love it. You don't have to worry about aids. I really get off on it if the guy it right.
<LI>A mildly amusing, passing fad.  Far too much has been made of the issue by religious zealots who cannot tolerate the idea of anyone enjoying himself.
<LI>The U.S. Is extreemly backward & fearful in this area. We create secondary trauma & fear in anything we bon't understand. We ignore the natural drives of all ages. At the same time, nothing should ever be forced on anyone.
<LI>Sex on the Internet is no different than sex on the street, you find it if you want it, or ignore if you dont!
<LI>its great
<LI>It makes me horny. Me and my wife and husband have orgies while looking at pictures we got from it.
<LI>to have recently lost my internet virginity i find that everything is censored and boaring
<LI>I havn't seen much or read much. You can find things out but, nothings free to see porn.
<LI>sex is o.k,in any way
<LI>it should not be banned.this should be no censorship! parents should take more responsibility.
<LI>sex is o.k,in any way
<LI>It's fun
<LI>I like sex on the net. I think there should be more.
<LI>I feel that everyone should have unlimited/uncensored access to the Net. Parents and ONLY parents should have censoring capabilities.
<LI>Great way to start out and learn more about your own sexuality
<LI>The Net provides honest and mature people a safe outlet to make the sexual aspects in their life more enjoyable.  I've been fortunate to have had a great childhood, a good education, and a job as a Systems Analyst which I like very much.  I happen to have a foot fetish, which is not very common in the mainstream media (they always talk about Breast or Butts, for example).  The Net has let me see that my sexual interests in woman are shared by many other normal, healthy people too.
<LI>mostly banal
<LI>THis nis My first time I think i will like it
<LI>Sex on the Internet is the best thing in the world!!!!
<LI>I see this as an opportunity to widen the perspectives of the large number of people who are in general (in my opinion) rather closed minded. You dont have to look , but dont stop me (or anyone else) from having the chance.
<LI>A O.K.
<LI>Would like more.
<LI>I think it is harmless
<LI>Sexuality has been corrupted by most religions,  The net allows for an opposing viewpoint.
<LI>sex is natural & I'm against censorship
<LI>I think sex on the Net is good for the hormones! It gives losers something to do when they can't get a date. It also can help the shy people meet someone. It also can get you life long friends, and hard ond too!
<LI>ok
<LI>Great - I only wish there were more on-line live sex using cuseeme 
<LI>Decreasing since censorship went into effect.
<LI>It's only a small part of it. It's much easier to go to your corner store and find it than it is to get it off the net.
<LI>It`s great to have sex on-line, to see tons of pics.
<LI>I would like to see it there if I need it
<LI>Ienjoy female nude pictures on the internet
<LI>I enjoy it tremendously
<LI>If we had a rating system, it would be easy for parents to censor what their children see.
<LI>I would like to see that it is more clearly marked and that the services provided are listed more clearly.
<LI>interesting and fun outlet. Also source of information
<LI>great!!!
<LI>I have not a lot experience with sex on the internet but im very intrested in it
<LI>great substitute
<LI>if your a inquiring young adult w questions regarding "what jane looks like", it's a goldmine.  as far as sex in "chat rooms", i've found that if someone is harrassing you, that person can be blocked from talking to you and most people are ligit.
<LI>There's more than I know
<LI>What i have seen is fairly difficult to access, but what there is covers a wide variety of interests.
<LI>noop  !
<LI>too hard to find what I want
<LI>I dont understand people who do net sex.  Ive spoken to people who do it, but id find it rather frustrating myself and no replacemnt for the real thing.
<LI>cheap thrills, some of it scared me, I find it harder to find "dirty" pics of women than of men or shall i say slaves?
<LI>Good place for anonymous exploration of taboo subjects...
<LI>There isn't enough free material!!!!!!!!!
<LI>It's everywhere, and it's bigger than ever..IN a bad sense..
<LI>Keep it open
<LI>It's all good. :)
<LI>I feel that there is nothing wrong with it at all
<LI>Doesnt bother me And if people dont want kids looking at porn that is why they have parents
<LI>I'M NOT GROSS OR ANYTHING BUT I LIKE PORNOGRAPHY,AND WISH IT WAS EVEN MORE ACESSABLE.
<LI>It's my favorate pass time.
<LI>i think if you are looking for it, you can find it on the net.
<LI>It´s great, it´s safe and clean.
<LI>i like it
<LI>Been there, Done that.leave it be.
<LI>Benign and fun
<LI>I like it
<LI>I think we need more of it for we who are waiting until we get married!
<LI>I think it's a great platform for open communication
<LI>should be more difficult to get hardcore
<LI>Good for the curious and (another) outlet for the more involved.  Maturity will eventually cover 90% of all aspects of Sex and the Internet.
<LI>very vage but you have to pay for everything!!!
<LI>ok, as it is..
<LI>I think it is a good idea to have it
<LI>It's ok for adults who want to participate.
<LI>I enjoy looking at the women, but get  tired of all the rip-offs 
<LI>It opens up people so they are able to talk about how they feel.
<LI>Well...
<LI>It is very enjoyable.
<LI>The interenet has allowed me to express the true feelings I have had all my life without worrying about what other people think about me...
<LI>THIS IS DISGUSTING THE WAY THE FEMALE ARE SHOWED;LESS THAN DOG!!!
<LI>I enhoy it vewry much.
<LI>It should not be up to the government to decide what I am allowed to look at.  I promote the use of cybersitter and other such control programs.  I should not be censored because parents don't watch their children.
<LI>I think its a lot of fun and should increase its content!
<LI>it gave me a hard on everytime
<LI>no comment
<LI>I think sex on the Net is a lot of SAFE fun!  No chace of diseases, and nobody gets hurt.  Let parents censor what they feel their children shouldn't see.  Don't give immature children access to the Net!
<LI>Sex is dirty, so it must be banned.
<LI>Need more of it
<LI>It's not that big of a deal!
<LI>not interested
<LI>I realy dont know but A 10 year old child can get into porn with Afiew clicks of the curcer 
<LI>I think it is both fun and educational.  But it should be monitored so children can not get into it with out the proper people around.
<LI>If people want to prevent their children from accessing sexual content, they should use filtering software, not the government.  ISP's should not be any more responsible for electronic content than telephone companies are responsible for what people say on the phone!!!
<LI>It's not that easy to find uncensored perversion one may look for!...
<LI>No problem if that is what you like
<LI>Hmmmmmm
<LI>The Net should not be censored.  Parents should be responsible for the actions of their children.
<LI>I think it's great.  I wish all of the religous fanatics and irresponsible parents who want the government to take care of their childred to simply shut up.
<LI>Much more fun in person. 
<LI>I would like more direct access to other sex adicts
<LI>There is a wealth of knowledge out here.  It is not all dirty pictures and sexy stories (I don't even have a graphics browser or a GIF compatable machine, so I don't even see the pictures).  I have been able to find out about alternatives to intercourse, which my Girlfriend and I use to remain celibate before our commitment.  I have also been able to find great amounts of information regarding STD (sexually transmitted diseases).  When I do get married, I hope that the sexual advice will still be here 
or my use.  The fact that some people cannot take the time to figure out how to use software to limit internet access or how to controll their children should not be taken out on my rights.
<LI>it´s ok!
<LI>RELAX..... Dont be so Fucking uptight!!!!
<LI>People should have a choice of what they want to do and look at on the Internet. Becides most if not all of the "SEX" areas of the internet are PAY areas.
<LI>I WANT MORE!!!
<LI>It is crazy that anyone would not let someone else not be exposed to sex on the internet.  I think more problems come from violence, but nobody cares about that. Sex is beautiful.  America should be open with sex of all races, gender, and ages.
<LI>I really think that things should be removed that are not educational in nature.  Pure, open pornography is just a way for sick perverts to get off when they can't get any in real life.
<LI>I think the major issue involves minors.  This is, for the most part an issue for parents.  When I go to a bookstore, I see Playboy and Penthouse within an arms reach of most teenagers, much more accessible than content on the net.  Parents need to talk to their kids and deal with it in their own way.  One concern, I see is in IRC.  Mostly it is self policing, but kids can lie, if they think about it.  A rating system would be great, but technically how it would address all protocols might be a very di
ficult problem. 
<LI>I do not believe in censorship.The net should remain free.
<LI>I love it- gives me a chance to explore!! Carry on my friends!
<LI>Leave "Free Speech" alone!
<LI>I really think that people should just mind their own business and let people do as they please.  it is important to have some rating or self-imposed regulatory body to watch for people misusing the services to hurt someone.
<LI>Sex on the Net is Here to Stay
<LI>I love it.  It allows me to explore other sides of myself.
<LI>I feel that it is good to the point of giving people a safe and entertaining means of releas.I am all for it providing the parents should be aware of what theire children are doing and with the help of service providers keep it all adult and all uin good clean fun
<LI>At this point, it's completely open.  There's so much porno and sex material, officials would probably find it surprising.  I've never had any trouble getting material or finding people like me.
<LI>excellent
<LI>Sex is natural, and I don't think it should be censored
<LI>I think it's great that it is so accessible, you can enjoy erotica in the comfort of your own home, with out ever leaving!
<LI>Sex goes hand in hand with everything we as humans do.
<LI>It's a way of letting off steam and tension and having fun.
<LI>I think it is fine!  We are people free to do as we please!
<LI>Mmmmm Mmmmmm Good Like Cambells soup (heheheheh)<---Perverted laugh
<LI>not graphic enough
<LI>I enjoy getting adult material over the internet. My husband and I do it together as well as alone. It does take too long to get pictures though. I prefer to get material right in my home than to go to the shops that sell the kind of material that I am interested in.
<LI>Helpful in unveiling humankind's true sexuality, removed from societal stigma.
<LI>Since the net is very annnymous, it is an outley for taboos, it will die down once people get thier fill.
<LI>I think it is helpful with my girlfriend and I.
<LI>very educational
<LI>I think it is great for adults.  Helps answer questions about a sexual nature without being ID.
<LI>I think it's wonderful
<LI>Good place to find pictures,movie clips, sound bits
<LI>It could be a valuable resource.  There are some real weirdoes out there, and it has redefined my definition of "normality."  But I believe that talking about sex on the internet probably helps debunk a lot of myths and also helps improve acceptance for people of non-traditional sexual orientation.  I think your borders are really tasteless, though.  Either find something more aesthetically appealing than a generic image of a bimbo with a huge bustline (Venus de Milo would be an improvement) or alterna
e it with an equally tasteless image of a musclebound stud.
<LI>I think they should not charge for access.
<LI>It should be easier to access what you really want!
<LI>Its just another avenue of expression found in America
<LI>this will also answer number 9...these are mutually exclusive. sex must be between two people who are separated by nothing except themselves. What could it be without touch?ithing but themselves
<LI>The more the better!!!!!
<LI>suck my pussy
<LI>To the degree that it may help people connect with others of a similar bent to discuss/meet, I think its a good thing
<LI>it is never free, exept on usenet
<LI>The interconnection of people with common sexual interests over a world-wide area is important in promoting personal freedom of expression while allowing normal social discretion.
<LI>It's gotten blown way out of proportion.  Besides, the more you tell someone they can't do or see something, the more they want to.
<LI>Parents, NOT the government should take responsibility for what their children see.
<LI>Just interested in exploring the subject - no comment
<LI>Sex is natural; the only thing unnatural is repression of sex.
<LI>I think it is a cool place to LEARN about sex.  It has helped my self life tremendously!!  I have learned ALOT about my partner's needs thru the net.
<LI>Love it!
<LI>GOOD!
<LI>It's a free world so why not it is still harmless
<LI>It rocks
<LI>I don't think there is enough of it.  I just don't see why people are getting so upset.
<LI>There is clear evidence of open honest conversation about sex as well as pornography, niether should be censored. However underage access is worrying, but I still believe I should be left to parents to regulate childrens access.
<LI>i like sex on the net and promote it, there should be more of it
<LI>Where will the censorship stop?
<LI>It was very interesting, and provided some interesting insights.
<LI>just curious
<LI>blown way out of proportion by policitians who are preying upon an unsuspecting and computer illerate majority.  It is censorship which has been cloaked in the disguise of protection of the public from pedophiles and perverts.  I fear that it is in reality the thin edge of the wedge.
<LI>I think it teaches people more than parents
<LI>Still have not found what i am looking for. There are so many choices, iwish there was a guide to direct me to my interests.
<LI>For now, sexual related subject is too accessible.
<LI>I don't really care what other prople do, as long as MY rights aren't infringed apon! In other words I think that parents are the only ones who should regulate, if at all
<LI>I love it a great way to get your dick off
<LI>Yet another set in the discourse on sexuality.  What would Foucault say?
<LI>it's good if you're horny
<LI>I think that from where I have been as far as participation in cybersex, it does promote dishonesty with spouse...I think people in sex rooms lie and that bothers me, I think they should figure out a way to have women only room unabtainable to men.
<LI>I (we) love it!
<LI>All for Free Speech
<LI>SEX?! WHAT SEX????!!!!!
<LI>I think it´s good that you can look at it if ya wanna
<LI>new to it and it is great!!!
<LI>i think sex on the net should be available to those who really want it.  it is not fair to sanction it so no one can enjoy it just because some people "can't help but bump into it".
<LI>great
<LI>Can't be enough.  
<LI>not much
<LI>I think sex is great. I,m married but I still enjoy looking at women. I also think that it's my bussiness to what I look at.
<LI>I fucking love it. I beat off to it every day twice.
<LI>love it but not for kids or people easily offended, but if you are that cool just dont bitch because if u are off ended dont go there!
<LI>I think that the internet should be a world that is free of censorship, where people can get together and express their desires, fantacies etc. without a governing body.
<LI>The Internet gives me lots of information. I like that.
<LI>It will always provide an avenue for decption but I have made many great connections thru IRC and CUSEEMEE. Only wish people would be honest at all times and realize we each have our flaws!
<LI>I think there should be more sex on the internet!  Just not where kids can find it.  All the old congress people that don't like it should not be on the internet!
<LI>love it
<LI>It is a good way to see how other people feel about some "taboo" issues
<LI>It's the greatest thing since whip cream!!!
<LI>Sex is a huge part of human existance, so is the internet these days.  The best place to have sexually oriented material is on the internet because it is very accessable and needs to be in a time when have unsafe sex can kill.
<LI>Totally harmless and safe.  
<LI>It's there if you want to find it.
<LI>Sex is life, to each his own. We are all different,education and chilhood experience are of great value.
<LI>The US considers violence acceptable, and sex as shameful and harmful. That's totally backwards!
<LI>It's a personal choice and should not be censored. 
<LI>I love internet, use it everyday, My kids both use it everyday, I watch there activities, I'v shown then what's there, and told them there not allowed to access it, when I see it accessed, I revoke there passwords for 1 week the first time, 1 month the second time.. and so on! .. Free speech on internet.. It's all information. what you do with the information is your own business/problem!
<LI>I have found Internet sex a safe way to release my sexual frustrations and am glad that it is available. I believe that it is/will become an important part of human sexuality in future.
<LI>Its Great
<LI>Have found none as yet as my provider does not allow access until a copy of driver's licence is posted.
<LI>I have no problems with it. free speech
<LI>Everybody talks about it, but nobody wants to do it with ME!
<LI>I think it is pretty cool
<LI>It gives me a hard on!
<LI>only a problem if you let it get that way
<LI>More Porn.
<LI>it's your thing;do what you wanta do
<LI>on chat lines you can talk openly without regard to what people think and can be more open....but the hardcore stuff needs to be taken off
<LI>I'm not sure.
<LI>Yipee!
<LI>where, when, and how?
<LI>It's FANTASTIC!!!!
<LI>I believe that sex and the internet can be a very cool thing if you are careful.  I have had good and bad experiences.
<LI>cool
<LI>I am quite surprised that there is as much available as there is..BUT...it is the wave of the future...
<LI>Its OK as long as those participating are concenting ADULTS
<LI>Fine with me
<LI>Both are good fun
<LI>THERE ARE TOO MUCH  DISGUSTING PICTURES ON THE NET.
<LI>Sex on the net is awesome
<LI>It gets me horny and makes me want to go out and try new things.
<LI>It is no worse than what you could find at a book store if you knew what to look for.
<LI>It's good if is not there excess(ex:pedophillia, animals...)
<LI>No comment
<LI>yup.
<LI>Overated.  
<LI>I think it's great, and safe
<LI>great, I really enjoy what I have seen
<LI>Great
<LI>disire 
<LI>what sex, I can't seem to find  much!
<LI>that is nice
<LI>amazingly erotic!
<LI>I use MUD environments to have a kind of sexual life with my boyfriend who lives in another country. So I don't think it's a bad thing at all. :)
<LI>it is very safe and can help satisfy some curiosity without going through the actions 
<LI>I enjoy it, and want it to stay.
<LI>No Answer.
<LI>Sex should be on the Net! Let freedom ring!
<LI>FUCK YOU
<LI>Give it up! If you want to have sex, pay a prostitute! Sex on the internet is a crock of shit!
<LI>is good !
<LI>I would like an opion on my choices
<LI>too many sites say FREE (but then you pay a "one-month fee" This is FALSE ADVERTISING
<LI>safe but unexciting
<LI>This is the first time I use the Internet and of course I go straight to the sex information.  I think so far it's been educational. 
<LI>I think people have the right to look at what they want to.
<LI>Even though its difficult to control, the availability of sexually explicit material is as basic a need as food, water, air, and any other desires that nature has endowed the human species with the ability to enjoy.
<LI>keep it free and innocent
<LI>I am married and I don't have much of a sex life. I'd love to have a sexual relationship with any female, either on-line or actual contact.
<LI>Too much convern, typical North American problem of focusing attention in the wrong area, focus sensorship on violence not sex.  Create a more open, less violent society.  The more sex is sensored the more perversions will grow!
<LI>Just another avenue for exploration and enjoyment but no juvenile or under age of consent material should be permitted,no exceptions!!!
<LI>I believe it is a healthy forum for the exchange of ideas, materials and fantasy
<LI>Like it
<LI>I feel that it should be up to the parent to install the proper programs to moniter their child's page jumping.  For those adults not interested and/or offended - tell 'em not to look.
<LI>Its great and helps relieve tension!
<LI>I am of the opinion that there are better uses for such fine technology that these.
<LI>To each his/her own...
<LI>Lets people be what they want in a harmless way.
<LI>Two great tastes that don't really fit together well... Bummer.
<LI>I believe that pornography should not be regulated by the government. I believe that it should be left to the discretion of the viewer.
<LI>Not sure, it seems that most sites want to charge for access. This seems somewhat bizzare, why would someone want to pay for these types of pictures. Ideally they could provide a dialogue forum which could discuss these items from a more intelluctual  perspective
<LI>I PREFER THE REAL THING
<LI>i like it !!
<LI>nice makes one really horny
<LI>I feel that it can be used for the wrong reasons
<LI>To me it's entertaining. Something to read and learn about.
<LI>I think that it is great and should not be censored.
<LI>i loved it i want more of it
<LI>It's just one more 'area of interest' on the net. As usual, sex is a controversial subject with most, and if you think sex is dirty and are embarrassed by it you don't think ANYone should have access. So, in finally addressing the question - I like sex on the Internet.
<LI>Let's cut it out for our kids sake
<LI>Good for a glimpse, but destructive in the long run!
<LI>I think there is too much garbage since everyone reveals in the anonimousity of the internet. It would be fine in special section  or rooms, fine, but it is all over. I have no problem with what other people do, and I do not believe in censorship, but you
<LI>I beleive we have become somewhat socialistic in our thinking. This is one area that no governmental entity should rule. Next it will be a punishable offense to have sex without a condom. Things have gotten way out of hand due to the media.
<LI>Internet *is* sex. The rapid growth of Internet is not due to the US DoD or the exchange of data between University scientist, but rather because it is a means to discover other (as much as cyber allows), in particular sexually. Let it be. This is freedom.
<LI>I love Sex and I love the net keep up the great work
<LI>If censorship continues, it will no longer exist...I'm still in America, aren't I?
<LI>not bad most real hardcore has gone to pay entry
<LI>I like the freedom and availiability of material with sexual content in it.  It has its place on the internet and should not be targeted for censorship.
<LI>It's alright
<LI>Sex on the net is generally a form of entertainment.  It should be regulated by parents.
<LI>cool deal
<LI>The Internet allows a freedom to openly discuss your sexual views, and after conversing with people on various talkers, IRC, MUDS, newsgroups, email, etc.  my life as well as my sex life have been enhanced for the better.  It has made me more open minded, more confident, and better educated about sex and its various aspects.
<LI>The internet is a useful tool, but people need to think of ways to regulate content within your _own home_.
<LI>i think it is great
<LI>Internet is a cultural engine that may allow the occidental world to escape the rising power of bigots and right-thinkers (who often are the "real" dangerous people when it comes to sex deviations.
<LI>Open-minded, all kinds, good, clean fun
<LI>I believe it is OK
<LI>it is gooooooooood  I GET BIG BONERS
<LI>i have been triing to access pornography for the last few min. and have had no luck
<LI>i think it is wonderful it is cheaper then bying magazines and although i may not be 18 i can pass for it
<LI>I think the freedom of speech and thought should be preserved, therefore it is important to fight to keep sex on the net.  As with all things parents should be there to  keep kids out of the areas they are not supposed to be in.  If so that they don't then it is there failing as parents and that is no ones fault but there own.  There are no excuses.  I have no desire for sex on the net, but I see the need to keep the freedoms that we have and if the Government steps in on and sensors material THEY thin
 is inappropriate then who is really in charge of what we see and do?  The freedoms that we have will be a thing of the past.
<LI>I think that there is not enough out there for those of us who are really looking for it.  I have an 8 year old son, and I don't worry about him running across something he has no business seeing.  Its no worse that what is on tv and in the movies and even commercials these days.  No censorship!!!!!
<LI>I thnk that it is a good thing to have online
<LI>ok :-)
<LI>There is nothing wrong with consentual adults "livening up their lives". However the danger lies in the hands of those who promote and/or support immoralistic and unlawful maierial. Singling out topics such as child pornogrophy, beastiality, rape, et al. These sights should not even exist, in that I see the server being at fault as well as creator, and seeker of such material. 
<LI>ITS AN EXTREMLY GOOD EFFORT BUT IF U COULD MAKE AN INDEX E.G IF WE TYPE SEX THEN IN THAT WE SHOULD GET 1.NUDES 2. STORIES 3.BIOLOGICAL 4.SAFE SEX 5.VIRGINITY ETC SO THAT WE CAN GO DIRECTLY RATHER THAN SCANNING EVERYTHING
<LI>Woohoo!
<LI>No one has yet defined what is obscene.
<LI>I think you shouldn't have to pay for sexual material on the net exept for specific companies that make their money from pornography.
<LI>Its everywhere.  You can't cencer it!!!
<LI>Sex on the internet is great!  It just needs more naked famous women.
<LI>iTz g00d!!!   
<LI>I think parents should use a program called SurfWatch. It monitors children's Internet sites
<LI>its just a bunch of machiens
<LI>I beleive it is a person CHOICE, no one should monitor what I want to see or hear. As for my son I WILL be the one to monitor him, NOT THE GOVERNMENNT
<LI>bEST LEFT OFF TO BE HONEST
<LI>I think that sex and the internet are great!!
<LI>it should be free and open to consenting adults
<LI>i love it
<LI>I'm an adult so I can view anything I want within limits.  I'm not a pervert but I enjoy looking at beautiful wemon.  I don't think there is anything wrong with that.  As for the more perverse stuff, child porn is sick and offenders should go to jail.  Beastiality is a curiosity for meany and I don't see anything wrong with it if the animal doesn't get hurt (but it is NOT for me).
<LI>i love it
<LI>I think it's great!
<LI>It's super!
<LI>I think pornography should be legal for anyone who is old enough (18 according to U.S. society) to view and download.  It is ridiculous that certain groups feel they have a right to tell me what I can and cannot do.
<LI>no opinion
<LI>Ithink the internet should develop a rates system
<LI>I'm glad to have access to "safe sex"!
<LI>could be better organized
<LI>Parents should be responsible for monitoring their children.  NO CENSORSHIP!!
<LI>Keep censorship by any agency out.  It's up to parents to censor their children
<LI>just learning
<LI>I enjoy doing what I want.  Don't need Gov't telling me what is good for me.  At 57 I think I'm  old enough to decide for myself.
<LI>The internet is just one of many sources available for sex and sexually oritented material.
<LI>great
<LI>The government should not censure it. It should be left up to the individual.
<LI>An anonymous alternative to those of us who do not have a sex life
<LI>AT THIS TIME I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.   IF SOMEONE DOES NOT WANT TO SEE IT DONT BRING IT UP ON THE WEB.  FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND ETC. IS WHAT I BELIEVE IN.
<LI>harmless, unless you want to pay for it..but if willing you can pay for sex anywhere..
<LI>Where can I find sexual CU SeeMe broadcasts?
<LI>IT is a graet source of information and stimulation.
<LI>It is an interesting diversion, and a complete waste of time and money.  I have spent quite a bit of time downloading, assembling, and converting binary images only to discover they couldn't be viewed due to some error or another.  It is much more arousing to go rent an adult video tape from a local video store, than to try to get a thrill on the INTERNET,
<LI>Its Fun and Intresting
<LI>sex and the net are good and fun
<LI>Cool
<LI>Its pure entertainment for adults.
<LI>very nice !!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Internet is good! Lots of sex will destroy it!
<LI>I like it!
<LI>IT's GREAT!!!!!!!!!
<LI>It's a great outlet for the little pervert in all of us. Let all over 21's have a ball.
<LI>I think it is a bit "free" but with supervision leave it alone.
<LI>I think that it is a great harmless form of expression, given that the audience is mature enough to handle these sex related sites.
<LI>its ok
<LI>freedom of expression.....safest sex possible
<LI>ITS FINE FOR THOSE INTERESTED BUT IT S/B PASS WORD CONTROLLED IN THE HOME, OFFICE, ETC.
<LI>often too slow for full appreciation
<LI>Sex is a natural thing and should be allowed on internet
<LI>its just interesting, just like anything else that's new
<LI>Do NOT forbid it ! Let US decide what we -and our children- want!
<LI>it's great
<LI>I believe that if parents would exercise more personal control over their children and quit abrogating their responsibilities the world would be a much better place to RAISE children.  I have an adult child who was raised under these standards and he is doing quite well, thank you.
<LI>ist super ich kann alles sehn was ich will
<LI>The net gives me a boner.
<LI>Internet is the way to freedom, all sorts of freedom.
<LI>cool
<LI>I didn't know there was sex on the internet
<LI>I didn't know there was sex on the internet
<LI>I THINK ITS GREAT 
<LI>I want more hardcore
<LI>The internet is in my opinion a place to express your thoughts and opinions without regulation.
<LI>I love it!  And keep up the good work!
<LI>It is everyone's responsibility to ensure that sexually, perverted material is distinguished entirely.  What happened to intimacy and an imagination?  It is really pathetic that people have to turn to such demeaning behavior-what are our children susposed
<LI>its great we need more of it
<LI>Ok, as long as you don¹t take it to seriously
<LI>Wish it was free (hee hee)
<LI>I find it very invorgating and sometimes really enjoy it.
<LI>I think it's very appaulling.
<LI>I love it .  I think that i does provide some kind of release of sexual frustrations and i enjoy the photos
<LI>I like to masturbate while looking at photos on the net.
<LI>I think its entertaining.
<LI>i love it
<LI>Still exploring - hoping it's a real satisfyer!
<LI>When will someone release the sex organ equivalent of a mouse?
<LI>Need to find a reliable way to screen out minors responsibly.  With all this technology, it should not be as difficult as many are making it.  The network community has not taken any steps toward self regulation which is why we see the government doing it for them.
<LI>it seems relatively harmless    and over all entertaining
<LI>I feel that it is fine for adults but when children get involed it is wrong!
<LI>Less commercial providers, more free exchange,no children,no animals !
<LI>it gives me a woody
<LI>I love to screw women, other than my wife, I like to meet them and 
<LI>I beleive that education (mat)only leave the other for the married bedroom
<LI>I don't think it's harmful. Adults can decide if they want to view sex on the net. I think parents need to take a more active role in the things their children do and they wouldn't have to worry about the things the kids shouldn't be doing.
<LI>Can't replace the real thing!
<LI>i enjoy being able to experience it
<LI>not much new out there
<LI>Maintain to adults only its great.
<LI>i wish there was lots more!!!!!
<LI>The computer gets in the way
<LI>getting harder to find
<LI>I like the surveys!
<LI>Recently it has become harder to wank online - not enough material
<LI>I love it. matter of fact i got a woodrow right now
<LI>Good for mature people who know how to really use it.
<LI>I think its cool but definitely overrated.  After all, this is a computer not a partner!!!
<LI>i think it's a lot of fun reading and trading messages
<LI>cheaper than Playboy :-)
<LI>I think it's great.  I wish there were more stories that were free.
<LI>It is a safe way for ADULTS to explore their sexuality.  I do believe that it is the sole responsibility of parents to keep their children from accessing pornography on the Inernet.
<LI>Sex is cool!
<LI>I think no one has the right to censor what information I have access to.
<LI>sex on the internet is important for sharing knowledge and experiences, but the sites should be rated so that minors of age don´t get access
<LI>IT'S A SAFE WAY OF APROACHING THE SUBJECT, YET PEOPLE CAN GET CARRIED AWAY AND OVERDEPENDENT.  AS FOR CHILDREN, THEIR ACCESS SHOULD BE LIMITED, BUT WHO'S TO WATCH?  THE INTERNET SHOULD BE FREE TO EXPLORE ALL SEXUAL ISSUES FOR ADULTS, BUT LIKE ALL GOOD THINGS THERE WILL BE ABUSE.
<LI>Most of it is all pretty tame.  The hard-core stuff usually seems to entail subscribing and is not particularly cheap for obvious reasons.  rawsex.com is a good site tho!! ;-))
<LI>it is no substitute for the real thing
<LI>I feel it is a way to express sexual desires.  But for those individuals who get off on it may be sick.
<LI>I've enjoyed many forms of sex from the very first time when I was 14.  I've been sexually active ever since.  I love when my partner has a big dick.  
<LI>I like it.
<LI>Great outlet
<LI>i need it do me
<LI>I don't mind
<LI>it rules, keep up th egood work
<LI>IT should be kept free of any bans or limitations. If something bothers an individual they need not use it. If there worried about children, the parents should deal with it themselves.
<LI>The Internet is a positive resource and outlet for information concerning sexuality.
<LI>It should not be allowed. Information on sex issues are ok.
<LI>Don't think it hurts a thing. Parents should supervise their children.
<LI>what people do in their own home is thier business, it is up to parents to regulate their childrens access to sexually explicit material.
<LI>Great
<LI>Sex i think can be fun and romantics. Internet is trying to duplicate it but will never, but may get real close
<LI>fine
<LI>Effort should be put in to developing software which can act as a gateway allowing access to mature audiences and restriction by guardian/parents to certain materials
<LI>It is VERY safe sex!
<LI>want more!
<LI>in the last year there has been less posting of binaries and more "garbage" posts.
<LI>nice
<LI>It's free, it's online, it's secretative.  I like it
<LI>I think that it's great that there is a forum where people can talk and recieve informatio from. However, I do think that there should be a way where young adults under the age of 18 are not allow to get the info. from off of the internet. But, I enjoy this because I can get all of the information that I would like without having to be embarrassed about who knows what I am searching for.
<LI>Hey, Sex is an important part of mankind, wherever we are it will be.
<LI>I believe in freedom of the press, so to speak. I think the net is a nonintrusive way to access sexual material for personal use and should be available at the discretion of the user.
<LI>This is like a radio or television.  If you don't like what you see, switch channels.  We as adults should have a choice as to what we want.  Nobody puts a gun to our head to go into a sex section of the internet.
<LI>I'm glad there is sex on the net and wish there was more and raunchier.
<LI>I LOVE IT
<LI>Governments stay out of it, its up to the parents! They should watch there kids, or lock up the internet access on there end of the computer!
<LI>Its Stimulating, and lets you explore your inner-most desires without the fear of sexually tranmitted diseases or weirdo's
<LI>Great.Do take all steps to ensure it remains available.
<LI>Great. Its about time there is an openess about sex.
<LI>Is best described like a never ending playboy magazine ...
<LI>Don't regulate - this is not the Victorian era this is the 90's !
<LI>As far as I'm concerned, the Internet is just another medium for accessing information about sex. I find it very informative, interesting, and quite harmless.
<LI>dissapointed. I find it hard to find interesting material but i have just started
<LI>8-)...
<LI>I find it entertaining.  
<LI>Well, sooner or later the kids are going to be adults, so I don't understand, why are we restricting them now, if they will have sex in the future.
<LI>The Internet is a global community and sex has to fit in!
<LI>It's a fact of life, live with it
<LI>I think that the Internet has opened the door to pornography beyond what it thought it was getting into.  There has not been, until letely, any regulation against child-porn.  It would be very easy for any child to get a hold of any pornography on the internet.  Parents should be involved but the system must take responsibility as well.
<LI>I think it's healthy but it should be obvious when you retrive a site what exactly is there.
<LI>It should be left to the individual.  It's like anything else, for those who want it they will find a way to get it. If they don't, they'll leave it alone.
<LI>It's fun to watch i find
<LI>no kick
<LI>I think it's great
<LI>I like it. Not only can people who are into pornography get what they want easily, but it's very informative at times. Parents should be the one's controlling their children. Not the government.
<LI>I don't get into that much.  However, I am concerned with government trying to regulate it.
<LI>I love it
<LI>It is good for an adult to get access to view sex materials in the net on his/hers own will, it prevents grown ups to have creazy (wrong) sex immeginations.
<LI>Waste of time
<LI>just a subset problem
<LI>all programs people can purchase for navigation on internet should be equipt with built in censorship whose preferences can be setby the user.
<LI>I think it is a positive way of exploring various activities and lifestyles in a discreet manner.
<LI>It's there. It's bad. But gov't keep off. Leave it up to us(parents/schools) to choose a provider that does/doesn't censor
<LI>I hope you make people aware we Netizens stand on the question of sex on the Net.
<LI>between consenting adults i believe the internet and sex can be intertwined as much as they desire. but children shouldn't have access to sex stuff on the net
<LI>i think its a free country what ever rocks your socks go for it
<LI>If you have a problem with it, don't web to it.
<LI>Not a big deal as much of it seems to require a paid membership to view
<LI>For now, simply interesting.
<LI>We should ban all gif formats. JPEG is the way to go to cut down on bandwidth
<LI>I haven't bee on the net long but I despise any type of censorship.  If you don't like what you see, go somewhere else.  The Fed. Gov. already controls too much of our lives.
<LI>it's great
<LI>I don't believe it should be censored at all.  I have children.  I monitor their activities in the internet.  I do not think its anyone elses job to, being resposible for your chinld is what makes one a parent.  If a parent deem that their child should learn about and be exposed to sex, the it should happen.  After all its the parents who andswer to god for thier children, not the government!!
<LI>the government should stay out of it
<LI>I love it
<LI>I don't have a problem with it, however, I believe that parents should take a more active roll in thier children's lives and make sure that the sex that is out here on the net is not available to them. Parents should also take the time to educate themselves about computers and internet sights so that they can safeguard their children from the pedophiles and "bad people" that are out on the internet, waiting to victimize them.
<LI>I'm at a remote assignment in Korea. Let's see some fine tight pussies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I think the Net should be OPEN, only available to those over 18, and controlled by parents in a home with children.
<LI>god bless america
<LI>I wish the gays didn't flood the Net with their stuff. When I look for Hetero stuff, Gay shit always comes up
<LI>it was part of the reason I signed up. Compuserve, my service, has chosen to restrict so I am considering change to America Online which I hear is less restrictive and lets subscriber chose what they want.
<LI>I think sex is great and the internet is brand new to me
<LI>There is no substitute for the real thing!
<LI>knowledgeable
<LI>I think that all pornographic material should have to be paid for. I also think there should be a waiting period to recieving the material. This would ensure that children do not get it, while at the same time, adults would be able to.
<LI>Sex is not a problem.
<LI>If it keeps the sexual deviants off the streets I'm all for it.
<LI>What I have found has been linked to selling something, and not just sex for sex highs.
<LI>It is fun!!! It's interesting!!!
<LI>i love it 
<LI>I believe that it gives some people who don't know much about the subject a "crash course" in learning.  I feel it promotes safer sex, and a little pervision.  However, if we can distinguish between fantasy (Net) and reality; it is a great tool.
<LI>It's great, but for adults only!
<LI>don't have much opinion, i'm not into that
<LI>more anal
<LI>Thank you
<LI>very interesting
<LI>very good and good
<LI>I'm not in favor of limiting people's access - but if parents want to control what their children see then it is their responsibility.
<LI>I've met some good partners, especially Black ones.!
<LI>I bought the computer for net use only.I hope to find more stuff on the net about sex for it will increase my knowledge. 
<LI>i have not had a defined experience with sex and the net, but it seems odd that the the two go together.  i mean i am a physical type of person and would find it hard to be excited by the things offered on the net. 
<LI>not enough
<LI>DO NOT REGULATE IT ON A FEDERAL, STATE OR LOCAL LEVEL!!! Make parents responsible for their kids in all activities including "net sex"!!!!
<LI>i don't  know much about it, but i am interested.
<LI>i like it!! It is safe.
<LI>I have stopped using the Internet for sexual conversation, etc...  It was a personal decision.  I don not think it is a healthy thing, mentally that is.
<LI>It is fine for Adults, but the restrictions should be from the parents or guardians if kids are present in the home
<LI>FREE SPEACH !!!!
<LI>Its fun!!
<LI>Great for healthy people to express themselves, but also a way for people to damage themselves if they are already sexually damaged (i.e. escaping from who they are)
<LI>not sure
<LI>The Internet is a valuable tool for sexual information exchange; it does a tremendous amount to help people understand what's really going on, rather than what they're spoon-fed.
<LI>exagerated
<LI>I enjoy the changes it has made in my relationship with my husband.  
<LI>homosexual contacts are easier than heterosexuals ... mostly males are on the net 
<LI>I wish there was more.
<LI>I think adults should be free to express themselves. I am against censorship of any kind.
<LI>Why does everybody make you pay so much to see naked pictures?  I can't find any free porn!
<LI>I don't think the internet should be censored. Sex isn't a bad thing.
<LI>A great way to learn about materials about which you would otherwise afraid to ask.
<LI>i have no problem with it parents should watch kids more and servers should provide rating system it is a merica let us choose what we look at
<LI>I think sex on the net is just like sex in mags and publications.  Vendors can check for age verification, why can't web-owners be allowed to do the same?
<LI>The more the merrier, it's not exactly a new invention!
<LI>It is out there but really difficult to find
<LI>The Internet is a fantastic new tool for broadening one's horizons. It's unfortunate that some individuals choose to pervert it with what I beleive to be inappropriate material.
<LI>Its exciting, but still new, doesn't replace the real thing!
<LI>Good for a rainy day, or if a person has some extra time, but if you're getting any more involved than that, you need a good therapist and a life.
<LI>I'm Concerned with 3 kids for what they can get into at home on the net
<LI>more sex...less internet
<LI>Like watching the bull fights, if it offends you change channels.
<LI>sex on the net is ok and entertaining
<LI>I have no problem with sex on the net!!!!!!!
<LI>Sex is what makes us feel human
<LI>Easy, fun, thrilling and good! For those who doesn't want to participate, go to another site, channel, page or whatever!
<LI>It's educational
<LI>I want to find very hard sex easylyon the net, it's too hard to find real sex!!!
<LI>I, of course wish that the net was completely open.  I do understand that parents and such have a real issue when it comes to the net and pornography.  Sex is if not the stongest one of the strongest forces in everyone's life.  I wish there was a way to have an open network and not risk exposer on those that are not yet ready for it.
<LI>I think its a healthy and safe way to explore your sexuality, at whatever level you wish (meaning you can access hard or soft porn, or topics pertaining to a specific sexuality or whatever).
<LI>It's all around - why try to should try to do away with on the Internet just because of a few Christian radical do-gooders!
<LI>Pornography is the largest segment in the entertainment industry, with all other forms emulating it (i.e. music, film, art, etc.).  You cannot avoid its pervasiveness in our society.  It's a natural extension of being human and must be accomodated on-line as it is with most other communication sources (i.e. phones have phone sex, films have pornos, music has Madonna, etc.).
<LI>Alot of fun
<LI>it is great i have fucked more poeple becayse of the internet
<LI>i think that it is a freedom issue... people should be able to view and read what they wish.. the internet is not owned by anyone, so the government should not restrict people on something they should have no control over.. i agree that children should no
<LI>Absolutely Love it!
<LI>I like it.  I hate to think the government is trying to take that right away from me...
<LI>I see no problem.  If Parents keep strict rules for their children, then what's all the fuss?
<LI>it is new and would cost alot of money
<LI>I think its part of information you find on the net, like info you find in a library.
<LI>I think Sex on the Net opens people to different experiences.  Besides, It is human curiosity that has made me look for stuff on the net that I haven't seen before, anywhere.
<LI>i think it is a way to keep from getting bored.
<LI>It's all right I suppose.
<LI>Love it!
<LI>I think that it should be regulated for those under 18 by the use of the site you use.  If it is at your private home then the parents should have the ability to have it resricted to use with a code (so young children can not see all pornography).  Now fo
<LI>it is not that easy to find sexual material on the net
<LI>I like reading sex stories. Pictures don't do much for me, but detailed stories really turn me on.
<LI>all types of photos are great but children should not have access
<LI>there really is none!
<LI>too much "for sale" , not enough FREE to see and try out
<LI>Free market. Govt should keep out of the child bearing responsibilities of the parents.
<LI>There's a lot out there but more and more of it is regulated by providers.
<LI>it's a content that another
<LI>I have no problems with it, wish people would monitor their children though
<LI>I don't think that the government has any business regulating the Internet!
<LI>I think sex should be allowed on the internet, everyone's gonna see it sometime!
<LI>The medium encourages the unusual and by doing so makes the unusual  all-too-common.  On the chat lines 14 year olds are getting on looking for "chics" and acting like total jerks - using parents access to talk genitalia and bestiality and anything to just "shock".  The parents aren't monitoring and these kids need a routing.  Where else  can a kid talk dirty and not get disciplined?  Home with no-class  parents and the internet.  Tired of it, tired of the fear of what is becomingg to our youth.
<LI>im an adult and like to surf and see!!!!
<LI>Hard to find!
<LI>i like it
<LI>I think there needs to be some form of regulation, because the material is too easy to obtain.
<LI>I think it is only natural that new technology envolves sex
<LI>WOULD LIKE MORE
<LI>sex in th net helps in satisfying our sex desires
<LI>all for it
<LI>It used to rule, but da gub-ment BLOWS!!
<LI>Its too easy for anybody to access
<LI>I just have to sit back and laugh when i see people having cybersex online, but i guess it's better than commiting some horrid things elsewhere.

<LI>Parents/caregivers are responsible for monitoring minors.
<LI>Parents have access to be able to lock thier children out of the internet and should do it!!! Everyone wants kids to know about sex and the dangers of it. They should be able to learn about it in the safety of thier own home.
<LI>The net should be completely open, but with warning screens telling you what EVERY site contains, lest you be offended. Then you can know to leave.
<LI>Pornography is not illegal, but I think things that could potentially endanger citizens, like the Terrorist's Handbook should be banned..
<LI>Install Parental Control software @ manufactor

<LI>Let adults decide for themselves
<LI>cyber patrol
<LI>let parents moniter their children's use of internet
<LI>People should police themselves.
<LI>Let the service providers censor what they want
<LI>completely open with voluntary rating system
<LI>a nice little program in my computer to screen content.  I would screen out all violence and until the kids are teens most hardcore sex.
<LI>Kill all tight ass politicians
<LI>Should be up to parents to stop children
<LI>establish a rating system and a way to let only adults to view material.. if possible.
<LI>Obviously, children are the concern here. I feel, as in most areas, if kids want it, they can get it. It up to the parents to regulate this, though to what extent is questionable. I suppose it depends on the kid, and how the parents have taught him/her what is right from wrong.

<LI>Allow only aldults into those areas
<LI>Have open access once registering in some way that you are over 18 .
<LI>If you don't like it, don't look at it.

If children are properly taught about sex, they won't go seeking information about it from unreliable, distorted, or dangerous sources. 
<LI>Damn parents should requlate w/ available software
<LI>It should be left to the individual to decide.
<LI>have what ever the hell you want
<LI>with age/consent limitations

<LI>Place warnings on material that has a sexual nature.  Make governers availibe for parients that wish to censor what their children see.
<LI>banish the 'influential groups'

<LI>I feel the parents of children should be responsible for what comes into the home.

<LI>Let the parents deal with it.
<LI>Self censored based on the individuals preference. Also parents should be responsible to supervise children/teenagers in respect to what they are allowed to view.
<LI>Frankly, I think it's a parent's responsibility to monitor what their children are doing. Adults should be able to do what they damned well WANT to do (provided it doesn't hurt anyone else).

<LI>Rating system in combination with screening chips in personal PCs
<LI>let it stay
<LI>have a lock out ofsome sort if you dont want access

<LI>Use blockers
<LI>Parents should monitor their children
<LI>it should be self governed by the individuals morality is a subjuctive opinion--it is not fair to have one's beliefs or subjectives standard given the right to choose what is right and wrong

<LI>kinderporno
<LI>and shut down hard-core pornography
<LI>Censorship should stay in the home

<LI>leave the internet open but place advisory for parents
<LI>use banning software.
<LI>i like fucking
<LI>If you Dont like it DON"T SURF IT!
<LI>Parents should watch their children
<LI>Ifpeople do not wish to know, don't go
<LI>Have some way for adults to log on to uncensored material.  Minors to be unable to obtain entry.
<LI>Educate; don't regulate.
<LI>put all censors in jail (maybe they'll feel safe there...)
<LI>leave up to parents and schools to choose providers with strict standards(ie AOL)
<LI>parents could restrict sits ith some sort of monitor
<LI>hey you dont like it leave
<LI>Don't like it don't access it!!
<LI>It is the parents job to teach morality and sex.  NOT the government. If the parents feel that it is ok, then the government should not get involved
<LI>let parents have a  "v" chip for under l8 years 
<LI>software locks
<LI>Provide filters and advice to limit access on an individual level
<LI>It is a difficult issue.  I don't believe in censorship, but do believe that cybersex is too easy (children can literally stumble upon very pornographic stuff.)  A rating system would only encourage curious children. I don't know the answer.  Too difficult for parents to monitor what kids are doing on the web.
<LI>and establish an internet-based self-regulating body
<LI>let your own morals set your standard of what you decide to view.
<LI>Parents should be responsible for their children's activities on "the net"
<LI>Parents, schools, etc...block access to certain sites...although you're never going to keep it all hidden.
<LI>Ultimely it should be censored at home, by parents or at least by some authority in the home.
<LI>leave it to individual responsibilty
<LI>A computer is not a toy and it is the parents responsibility to moniter a child while online.
<LI>Gov't allow websites to check DrivLic nums w/ Bday
<LI>Restriction should be in the home
<LI>the net should be completely open and parents should monitor their children
<LI>Parent's Should be responsible for their Children
<LI>Shut down all that many influential groups
<LI>There are currently downloadable programs to protect children and there is no need for government to censor content on the net.
<LI>Households, especially with children, should be their own censors!
<LI>limit types of content (i.e. pedophilia, snuff porn, hate/humiliation.)
<LI>I think the parents need to be more responsible for their children.
<LI>Have Internet I.D.'s showing people over 18
<LI>Continue to develop software screening technology.
<LI>It's the parents job to censor the Net.
<LI>let the site decide, and at the site for those over 18 have a certain code the obtain with id
<LI>Limit access from the client end
<LI>it is a parent's responsibility
<LI>people have their own numbers, depending on their age.  When you apply for an access to the Net you get a number that only fits your computer.  If you are under age for certain pages you won´t be able to access them.  SIMPLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Rating system combined with shareware nanny utilities for parents.
<LI>parent controll i can block the inter net better than anyone!
<LI>I think there should be a way to control what minors can get to on the net.
