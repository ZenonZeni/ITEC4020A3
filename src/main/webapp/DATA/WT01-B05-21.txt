<br>

I caught James Worden, CEO of Solectria, who is here with the Solectria
Sunrise, an all composite purpose built EV.  Solectria is also represented by
at least a couple of their E-10 pickup trucks (conversions of the Chevy S-10)
and no fewer than 4 Forces (conversions of the Geo Metro and Metro LSI).<p>

        I asked him what the state of the Universal Motor Controller (UMoC,
pronounced "You-Mock").  He announced this all-software controlled controller
design a couple of years ago, and I have been asking where it was in its
development every time I run into him or any of the engineers from Solectria.
As it turns out, the first beta version has shown up here at the American Tour
de Sol (ATdS) in Tom Hopper's "Hopper EV", number 94.  Tom swapped out the
brushless DC motor and controller and has installed the UMoC and an AC
induction motor.  James says that Tom wants to eventually go back to the
brushless DC motor, but when he does, he will be able to simply reprogram an
Erasable Programmable Memory (EPROM) through the serial port on the
controller.  In fact, that is the "universal" part of the UMoC.  The idea is
that the operational logic for controllers for all sorts of motors (brushed
DC, brushless DC, AC induction) of all sorts of power ranges could be built in
a single, mass produced (and hence inexpensive) logic unit which would be
attached to a power unit suitable to the task at hand (low, medium, high
power; single or multi-phase).  James expects that the Solectria trucks will
have the UMoC by the end of the year.  He also expects it to be for sale to
the EV conversion market in the fall.<p>

        The Sunrise is the all composite vehicle that Solectria announced at
EVS-12 last December.  The car is bright yellow with a tan "skirt" around the
bottom fifth of the side and back.  It is very rounded and very smooth 2 door,
4 passenger car that weighs 1694 pounds; gross weight capacity is 2376 pounds
giving a 682 pound payload.  It has one 42 kW nominal/50 kW peak AC induction
motor and front wheel drive.  It has the Ovonic nickel metal hydride battery
and James says that their goal is to break 200 miles per charge during the
race.  (They in fact did that on Thursday with 228.1 miles on a charge.  That
is the NESEA number from Friday morning's data sheet.  James was saying that
it was 238.  Both maybe right if James drove farther after the official lap
was completed, but the NESEA number most likely to be quoted since it was
refereed.)<p>

        I had heard that even the springs were composite, but that is not the
case.  "We haven't gone to the very extremes," says James, "but we are trying
to take weight out as practically as possible without going to too many high
cost methods."  They already had a pretty light drive train, but managed to
shave some more weight off it.  The body is a mix of all different composites
and plastics, some aluminum and a tiny, tiny bit of steel.  One of the tricks
for keeping weight down is to make parts serve two and three purposes.  So a
fender may also serve as insulation and as an interior panel.<p>

        The goal is to build a comfortable four passenger vehicle with very
high efficiency.  The people who are interested in making this happen like
Boston Edison, the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC), and ARPA
think that a tiny car is not going to be as salable as mid-sized or full-sized
car, which the Sunrise is.<p>

        The vehicle in the race is a prototype to learn if these things can
actually be done and made to work.  As such, there are some peculiarities in
this car that would not exist when it is done for real.  For instance, the
roof has simulated solar cells on it, although a solar panel sits on the rear
deck under the rear window and powers an air circulating fan.  The door
windows do not roll down, so air conditioning is absolutely a must.  The
Hughes MagnaCharge paddle socket was not yet in place under the license plate
in the rear, although the 110 VAC and the 220 VAC charging plugs were.  (I
understand that the Sunrise is actually being charged using the MagnaCharge
system, but obviously not in the final configuration.  The MagnaCharge people
have been following us throughout the race.]) The body appears seamless, with
the only lines being those around the small hood, the small trunk lid, and the
rather large doors.  There are no strips of chrome to hide the fact that two
body panels are mating.  It is actually made of several pieces, but "the goal
is to keep the part count down because that keeps the joints and the weight
down and hopefully makes it simple to build as opposed to making millions of
parts cheap and having it expensive to build." "Steel is good, it has been
proven to be safe, even in electric vehicles, but these materials can get
better safety with considerably less weight."<p>

        The Sunrise is using the same control system as was in the Solectria
Force.  The drive train was developed for this project, but it is now being
put in the new Force cars.  A lot of work went into making the interior very
quite (I suspect because you don't have the engine noise to mask all the
other noises sources) and also into making the doors work exactly right.  The
doors "slam" differently from most cars, because the are so much less massive.
But the mate to the door opening perfectly and latch with the slightest
pressure.  James indicated that it took a lot of work to get that just right,
but of course it is absolutely essential to give a quality look and feel to
the car.<p>

        Looking under the hood is almost disappointing.  Things are so
uncluttered and simple it doesn't look complicated.  (Of course that is good,
but it is so much easier to be impressed by all the stuff under the hood of a
high-power car.) The usual Solectria controller is there, the usual looking
Solectria motor, although with a special dual shock dampener that isolates
motor vibration from the body, and the other few support components such as
the power brake pump and the DC-DC converter for the 12 Volt loads.<p>

        All the batteries are in a tunnel that runs down the center of the car
and between the left and right passengers.  A cooling fan forces air down the
tunnel when the batteries get warm, and turns off automatically when they cool.<p>

        I tried to draw a comparison between this and the GM Impact.  James
immediately said, "no.  This is a much bigger car."  The aerodynamic shapes
are similar, but the fact that the Impact is 2 passenger and the Sunrise is 4
puts them in very different classes.<p>

       There is no separate bumper, but James said that the car will meet the
Department of Transportation tests, including the 5 mph bumper where no damage
that costs money can be inflicted.<p>

        The second Sunrise is being built now and it will be crash tested this
summer.  The third will be built as refined prototype based on what is learned
from the first two.<p>

        James made very clear that he was indebted to his sponsors.  Boston
Edison, NAVC and ARPA.  Their interest in this and other related projects,
such as earlier drive train projects, accelerated this work considerably.
Nick Karditsas is from Ovonic, the company that provided the Nickel Metal
Hydride batteries in the Sunrise.  It is an advanced battery for EVs,
developed under funding of the United States Advanced Battery Consortium.
Nickel Metal Hydride batteries have an energy density of about 75 Watt-hours
per kilogram, as compared to 25 Wh/kg for lead acid batteries.  The Sunrise
has a 25 kWh pack composed of 18 10-cell, 12 Volt, 120 amp-hour modules in a
single Volt string.  Beyond that, the power train is the usual Solectria AC
induction motor system.  The charger uses the Hughes MagnaCharge inductive
coupler system.<p>

        An unusual aspect of NiMH batteries is that the discharge chemistry is
actually slightly endothermic;  the chemistry actually > cools < the battery
as it discharges.  According to Nick, the effect is apparent at a C/6 (20
ampere) rate.<p>
