Nosa Igiebor is editor in chief of <I>Tell</I>, Nigeria&#146;s best-selling independent newsmagazine, and an outspoken critic of the country&#146;s successive military regimes, including that of current dictator Gen. Sani Abacha. Igiebor and his staff at <I>Tell</I> have come under repeated assault for exposing government corruption and denouncing the aborted transition from military rule to democracy after the June 1993 elections. <P>

On Dec. 23, 1995, Igiebor was arrested without charge by six agents of the State Security Service (SSS) and placed in solitary confinement. SSS agents simultaneously seized 20,000 copies of <I>Tell</I>&#146;s Christmas Day edition with the cover story &#147Abacha Is Adamant: Terrorizes the Opposition.&#148; During the following month, over 110,000 additional copies of <I>Tell </I>were seized from printing presses and newspaper vendors as the government escalated its efforts to cripple the publication editorially and financially. <P>

Authorities continue to demand that Igiebor reveal his sources for articles published in <I>Tell </I>condemning Abacha&#146;s government. But he has repeatedly refused to do so and as a result has been relocated to a maximum security prison in Minna State where he is denied his right to legal counsel and family visitation. <P>

In January 1996, the federal government announced that Igiebor was being held under Decree 2 of 1984 for acts prejudicial to state security. In February, Igiebor&#146;s attorney, Chief Gani Fawehinmi, was also arrested without charge, and he continues to be held in a maximum security prison facility in Bauchi State without access to family or legal counsel.<P>

Igiebor, a 1993 recipient of CPJ&#146;s International Press Freedom Awards, is no stranger to the tactics that Nigeria&#146;s military strongmen use to silence opposing voices. He was deputy editor of <I>Newswatch</I> magazine in 1986 when the editor, Dele Giwa, was assassinated by a parcel bomb after <I>Newswatch</I> was suspended for publishing recommendations on political reform.<P>

As <I>Tell</I> magazine has matured into a strong voice in defense of press freedom, the staff has come under increased harassment: senior editors and managers are frequently arrested and reporters beaten; their editorial offices have been occupied<B> </B>by SSS agents; editions have been seized regularly and the magazine itself has been banned. In May 1995, Igiebor was forced into hiding after a warrant for his arrest was issued for contempt of court. The charges were in connection with articles he published exposing the government&#146;s manipulation of the Abuja High Court to prevent pro-democracy organizations from holding public meetings.<P>

In March 1996, the Committee launched an international campaign, &#147Nigeria: The Press Under Siege,&#148; to bring world attention to Gen. Abacha&#146;s relentless assault on the country&#146;s independent press. CPJ has also initiated a letter-writing campaign to secure Igiebor&#146;s release and urges readers of this page to join in the appeal.<P>
