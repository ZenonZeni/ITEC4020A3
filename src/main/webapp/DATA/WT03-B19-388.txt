<TITLE>Climate Change Fact Sheet 222</TITLE>

<HR>
<I>The following three conferences dealt mainly with the issue of the environment and sustainable 
development, but they also made contributions to the international debate on climate 
change.</I><P>
<B>The 1989 Tokyo Conference strongly supported international negotiations for a climate 
treaty. </B>Held from 11-13 September, the Tokyo Conference on the Global Environment and 
Human Response Towards Sustainable Development addressed two major areas of global concern: 
Development and environment in developing countries, and the changing atmosphere. Its conclusions, 
intended as a contribution to the process leading to the 1992 United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development (UNCED - see fact sheet 207), are set out in the chairman’s 
statement.1<P>
<B>The Tokyo Conference statement stresses the importance of international cooperation in 
environmental protection.</B>  Particular reference was made to research, technology transfer, 
strong implementation mechanisms, and innovative approaches to international funding (such as 
"debt-for-nature swaps"). It identifies the emission of harmful gases from industrial sources and from 
current land-use practices as a possible cause of global warming, and it urges all states to participate 
fully in the current international negotiations on a climate treaty (fact sheets 208 and 209).<B> 
</B>The statement also outlines actions that should be taken by developing and developed countries 
to protect tropical forests. To this end, it recommends the strengthening of relevant international 
programmes. Although not directly aimed at the issue of global warming, this recommendation is 
relevant since tropical forests act as "sinks" for carbon dioxide. Finally, the conference statement 
addresses a number of recommendations to industry, asking that business practices reflect 
environmental considerations.<P>
<B>The 1989 Langkawi Declaration on Environment of the Commonwealth Heads of 
Government identifies the greenhouse effect as a serious environmental problem.</B>2 
Adopted on 21 October 1989 in Langkawi, Malaysia, the declaration does not deal exclusively with 
the problems of developing countries. However, it does emphasize the importance of sustainable 
development and of economic growth, and it expresses deep concern over the degradation of the 
environment. The participants discussed the issue of global warming on the basis of the findings of the 
Commonwealth Expert Group on Climate Change. In their view, the responsibility for environmental 
measures should be equitably shared by countries, although the ability of developing countries to 
respond should be taken into account.<P>
<B>The Commonwealth Heads set out a programme of action and asked the Commonwealth 
Secretariat to put it into effect.</B> The commitments with a relevance for climate change 
include:<P>
Advancement of policies and programmes for sustainable development; <P>
Strengthening of international funding mechanisms for responding to environmental threats, 
including assistance to developing countries;<P>
Support for the work of IPCC and active participation in the international negotiations <P>
on a climate treaty, which should be concluded as soon as possible. To this end, the 
Commonwealth’s Secretary-General was asked to establish an experts group which would keep 
up-to-date on the ongoing climate work; <P>
Promotion of improved energy efficiency, the reduction and eventual phase-out of  
ozone-depleting substances, afforestation, and development of new agricultural  practices;<P>
Support for developing countries in their efforts to achieve sustainable forest management; 
and<P>
Support for low-lying coastal and island states in their efforts to protect themselves against the 
threat of sea-level rise.<P>
<B>The 1991 Beijing Conference</B> <B>emphasized the special needs of developing 
countries.</B> At the invitation of the Chinese government, 41 ministers from developing countries 
met in Beijing in June to discuss issues related to environmental protection and sustainable 
development. The Beijing Ministerial Conference of Developing Countries on Environment and 
Development highlighted global climate change as one of the serious environmental problems facing 
the international community. The resulting Beijing Ministerial Declaration emphasizes the need for 
technology transfer to developing countries on a preferential, non-commercial basis, and for the 
provision of new and additional funds. The future framework climate treaty should incorporate "firm 
commitments by developed countries" on these issues.<P>
<B>The Beijing declaration states "developing countries cannot be expected to accept any 
obligations in the near future" under a future climate treaty.</B> Instead, they should be 
"encouraged", through financial and technical assistance, to adopt response measures. The 
declaration expresses support for the ozone convention and protocol (fact sheet 224); however, it 
states that compliance by developing countries is contingent on the provision of financial resources. 
The declaration also stresses the common but differentiated responsibility of states at different stages 
of development and the sovereign right of states to exploit their own natural resources. <P>
