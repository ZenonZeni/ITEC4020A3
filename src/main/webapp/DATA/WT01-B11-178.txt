<B>Outdoors Cards Due for Renewal in 1996


</B>

</CENTER><P>
The Ministry of Natural Resources reminds anglers and hunters to check the expiry date of their Outdoors Card.  Cards issued in 1994 expire at the end of 1996 and need to be renewed.<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="oc.gif"></CENTER><P>

Application forms will be mailed automatically to the address on file for those whose current card is coming up for renewal.  Cardholders who were expecting a renewal form and have not received it by late November should call toll-free 1-800-387-7011.<P>

Forms should be completed and returned to MNR immediately to ensure that they are processed in time before the beginning of the next fishing or hunting season.  This is especially important for hunters who plan to enter one of the 1997 wildlife draws.<P>

The fastest and easiest way to renew an Outdoors Card is by telephone using a Visa or Mastercard.  Instructions for renewing by telephone are contained in the mailed renewal package.<P>

Anglers and hunters must have a valid Outdoors Card to purchase a fishing or hunting licence.<P>
