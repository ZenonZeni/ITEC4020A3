<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Polymeric electrolyte gels immersed in an electrolyte solution deform under an electric field, therefore they are capable of transducing a stimulus into mechanical energy. Since the electromechanical phenomenon in synthetic polymer gels was first observed in 1982 by Tanaka et al. [1] several workers have been studying the volume changes and the deformation behavior of polymer gels in an electric field. Applications such as artificial muscles [2-5]actuators [6] and controlled drug delivery [7] for these gels have been explored. The polymers used are mostly random copolymer or polymer blends having acrylic acid or sulfonic acid pendant groups. The major problems with these polymers are their weak mechanic strength and long response times.<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this work, we studied the electromechanical behavior of an elastomeric hydrogel, heavily sulfonated styrene/ethylene/butylene/styrene triblock polymer [8] and showed that this material represents a new class of electro-response polymers.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>EXPERIMENTAL</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><B>Materials:</B></i> Styrene/ethylene/butylene/styrene (Kraton G-1652) block copolymer was sulfonated using SO3/triethyl phosphate [8]. The level of sulfonation of the styrene blocks ranged from ca. 15 and 68 mol%.  Films of the sulfonic acid form were prepared as described elsewhere [8]. The dried films were about 0.2 mm in thickness and were neutralized in aqueous NaOH before being swollen in de-ionized water for at least two days.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><B>Electromechanical Properties:</B></i> The gel was swollen in the appropriate solutions for more than 24 hours. The electrodes were platinum plates with dimensions of 25 x 30 mm and were 43 mm apart. One end of the gel film was attached to a piece of vinyl tubing that was placed midway between the electrodes. The gel and the electrode faces were parallel to each other and immersed in Na2SO4 solutions. A Lambda model LK342A FM regulated dc power supply was used to provide the voltage, which was between 5 and 35 V and corresponded to field strengths between 1 and 8 V/cm. The electromechanical response of the gel was observed using a CCD camera and recorded with a VCR. The bending profile with time was analyzed by a PC with <I>Optimas</I>, an image analysis software.

<H3>RESULTS &amp DISCUSSION</H3>
<P>
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><B>Swelling Experiments:</B></i> The swelling ratios for different sulfonation levels are plotted in <A HREF="images/figure1.jpg"><B>Figure 1</B></A>. As anticipated, the gels swell more as the degree of sulfonation increases.  The swelling is apparently not linearly dependent on the degree of sulfonation, which is similar to what has been observed with PAMPS [9].<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><B>Electromechanical Response:</B></i> When a dc field was applied, the gel bent toward the negative electrode, i.e., the cathode, which is consistent with other reports for polyanions such as PAMPS. The gel bending increased rapidly at beginning of applying the field and finally reached an equilibrium value. The degree of bending is dependent on the size of the gel, so throughout the experiments, the gel dimensions were kept constant as much as possible. <A HREF="images/figure2.jpg"><B>Figure 2</B></A> plots the equilibrium bending angles at different solution concentrations when we used the same gel and same applied field strength. A maximum bending at 0.02 M Na2SO4 was obtained. This is probably due to the following reasons. When the salt concentration is low, the osmotic pressure in the gel is high, and the osmotic pressure difference between the two sides of the gel, which is believed to be the driving force of the bending, is therefore also large, so the bending increases with a decrease in the Na2SO4 concentration. However, as the Na2SO4 concentration decreases, the conductivity of the solution also decreases and the voltage across the gel is lower since more and more voltage drop occurs between the solution and the electrodes. The concentration gradient is therefore lower. A maximum occurred at ~ 0.02 M Na2SO4 because of these two contradicting effects.
<p>	
<dd> The current as a function of sodium sulfate concentration is also shown in <A HREF="images/figure2.jpg"><B>Figure 2</B></A>. We also studied the speed of bending. Here we define the time that it takes the gel to bend to half of the equilibrium bending angle after the electric field was turned on as the response time and similarly, the time for the gel to relax to half of the equilibrium bending angle as the relaxation time. The response times were basically unchanged for all the sodium sulfate concentrations and the relaxation was faster at higher concentrations. That the response time did not change with the salt concentration indicated no fundamental difference in the bending mechanism between low and high sodium sulfate concentrations. <p>

<dd> Using the same gel and same salt solution, the gel bending as a function of voltage is plotted in <A HREF="images/figure3.jpg"><B>Figure 3</B></A>. Bending increased at the beginning with the voltage and eventually leveled off although the current continued to increase as voltage increased. A plot of the angle vs current indicated that they are not linearly related. The response time decreased with the increasing voltage, so the bending is faster at larger field, most likely due to the faster diffusion rate. The relaxation of the gel, on the other hand, remained unchanged.<p>
<dd> The bending for gels with different sulfonation levels is also plotted in <A HREF="images/figure1.jpg"><B>Figure 1</B></A>. As expected, the bending increased with the sulfonation level, but appeared to increased more sharply at higher sulfonation level. Both the response and relaxation times were essentially unchanged at different sulfonation levels.<p>
<dd> The gel swung when the polarity of the applied field alternated. <B><A HREF="images/figure4.jpg">Figure 4</A></B> is a typical response curve for a 50% sulfonated gel at 8 V/cm, in 0.02 M sodium sulfate solution. The bending reaches a maximum in about 2.5 seconds.</FONT>
<P></P>
<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3><P> 
<FONT FACE="ARIAL">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have studied the swelling and electro-response of a new elastomeric hydrogel at different solution concentrations, degrees of sulfonation, and field strengths. The bending exhibited a maximum when the salt concentration was about 0.02 M Na2SO4. Bending was larger at higher sulfonation levels and higher field strengths although the bending tended to level off at higher field strengths. Further experiments are underway to optimize the response and to understand more about the bending mechanism.</FONT>
