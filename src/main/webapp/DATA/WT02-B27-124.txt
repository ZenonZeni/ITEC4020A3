<br>p.1133. Treatment of incompetent elderly patients with life-threatening illness varies widely within and between countries. Uniform standards should be developed on the basis of societal values and be communicated to physicians.
<br>p.1138 Age, correlating highly with number of years in practice, was associated with less aggressive therapy. Family physicians were more likely than specialists to choose more conservative therapy.
<br>p.1138 Although the wishes of the patient and his daughter represented a fourth factor that strongly influenced the decisions an appreciable proportion of physicians ignored them. This was true even when the wishes were expressed in an explicit written directive. Overall about 40% of the physicians provided a level of care different from what had been requested. In six of the seven countries more than 10% chose treatment options that differed significantly from the wishes.

<p><li>Annas G. The Health Care Proxy and the Living Will. New England Journal of Medicine 1991; 324(17): 1210-1213.
<br>p.1210 The term &quotliving will&quot was coined by Luis Kutner in 1969 to describe a document in which a competent adult sets forth directions regarding medical treatment in the event of his or her future incapacitation. The document is a will in the sense that it spells out the person's directions. It is &quotliving&quot because it takes effect before death.
<br>p.1211 The Cruzan case itself, which involved facts essentially identical to those in Quinlan, gave impetus to the concept of a health care proxy, just as the Quinlan case had previously increased interest in the living will.
<br>p.1211 Although new laws are not necessary in any state (because of existing laws regarding the assignment of a durable power of attorney), the current trend in the United States is for states to enact additional proxy laws that specifically deal with health care.
<br>p.1211 Two of the best-written proxy laws have recently become effective in New York (in January 1991) and Massachusettes (in December 1990).
<br>p.1211 Hospitals can impede the process of making good decisions, however, if they concentrate on the paperwork rather than on the way in which decisions are made. Some Massachusetts attorneys, for example, have already drafted a 13-page, single-spaced proxy form that is all but unintelligible to non-lawyers.
<br>p.1212 The most useful form for both patients and providers is a simple one-page document that sets forth all necessary information in easily comprehensible language.
<br>p.1212 Perhaps out of concern for efficiency, some commentators have advocated combining an organ-donor form with the form designating a health care proxy. This is a serious error for at least two reasons.
<br>p.1213 Designating a health care agent gives us all the opportunity to confront our mortality and to determine who among our friends and relatives we want to make treatment decisions on our behalf when we are unable to make them ourselves.

<p><li>Annas G. When Procedures Limit Rights: From Quinlan to Conroy. Hastings Center Report 1985 Apr: 24-26.
<br>p.24 The New Jersey Supreme Court has concluded that there is no analytical difference between terminating artificial feeding and discontinuing a mechanical ventilator, an action permitted in the 1976 Karen Ann Quinlan case.
<br>p.26 ...the &quotNew Jersey approach&quot of declaring broad-ranging substantive rights, and then attempting procedurally to restrict their application to very narrow categories of patients, creates a &quotCatch 22" effect that fails to promote the autonomy of once-competent patients.

<p><li>Battin M, The Leat Worse Death. 1994 New York Oxford, Oxford University Press.
<br>p. 102. "Although philosophers do not agree on whether moral agents have positive duties of beneficence, including duties to those in pain, members of the medical world are not reticent about asserting them.  "Relief of pain is the least disputed and most universal of the moral obligations of the physician", writes one doctor.  "Few things a doctor does are more important than relieving pain", says another.  [Refs. E D Pellegrino, "The clinical ethics of pain management in the terminally ill", Hospital Formulary 17 (Nov 1982): 1495-96; Marcia Angell, "The Quality of Mercy", New England Journal of Medicine, 306 (Jan 1982): 98-99.] These are not simply assertions that the physician "do no harm" as the Hippocratic Oath is traditionally interpreted, but assertions of a positive obligation.  It might be argued that the physician's duty of mercy derives from a special contractual or fiduciary relationship with the patient, but I think this is an error: rather, the duty of medical mercy is generally binding on all moral agents, and it is only by virtue of their more frequent exposure to pain and their specialised training in its treatment that this duty falls more heavily on physicians and nurse than on others."
<br>Note: p 128-129. "It is sometimes argued that physician assistance in a patient's suicide would violate the Hippocratic Oath.  It is true that the Oath, in its original form, does contain an explicit injunction that the physician shall not give a lethal potion to a patient who requests it, nor make a suggestion to that effect.  (To do so was apparently common Greek medical practice at the time.)  But the Oath in its original form also contains explicit prohibitions of the physicians accepting fees for teaching medicine, and of performing surgery - even on gall stones.  These latter prohibitions are not retained in modern reformulations of the Oath, and I see no reason why the provision against giving lethal potions to patients who request it should be.  What is central to the Oath and cannot be deleted without altering its essential character is the requirement that the physician shall come "for the benefit of the sick".  Under the argument advanced here, physician's assistance in patient suicide may indeed be for the benefit of the patient.  What the Oath would continue to prohibit is physician assistance in the suicide for the physician's own gain or to serve other institutional or societal ends."
<br>p. 55. "Thus, just one thing is clear: until the issue of the moral status of altruism itself is resolved, we ought not to uncritically perpetuate policies and practices in medical decision making that preclude its possibility altogether.  To do so is to deprive the patient of the possibility of retaining his or her status as a moral agent, and to make him or her a "patient" in not only a medical but a moral sense as well.  Among the indignities that medicine is capable of inflicting, this may be among the most profound."
<br>p. 229 "On the other hand, stealing, intimidation, and outright aggression may be "natural" behaviour, and yet are severely discouraged."  "Arguments against suicide that hold that it is "unnatural" because it runs counter to ordinary human inclinations are inadequate as moral arguments against suicide; such arguments move from "is" to "ought" arguing that because human beings do generally attempt to remain alive rather than kill themselves, they ought always to do so."
<br>p. 230. "The natural law argument does not make clear what obligations are imposed upon individuals whose capacities to function have been seriously diminished by disease or disability; these, however, are often situations in which suicide, or prearranged euthanasia, may be considered." 
<br>[Chap.13, Assisting in Suicide: 17 Questions physicians and mental health professionals should ask]
<br>1. Is the person making a request for help?  For example, when somebody wants assistance in suicide is it in fact cloaking some other aspect or some other solution which may be found?
<br>2. Why is the person consulting a physician or mental health professional?  Has the consultation been sought because the person has certain expectations from the professionals?
<br>3. What has kept the person from attempting or committing suicide so far?  Is it fear of consequences, or given advanced illness or physical limitations they simply cannot obtain the means of causing death?  Is the time for suicide not yet right? Or is the person seeking some sort of approval?  
<br>4. Is the request for help in suicide a request for someone else to decide?
<br>5. How stable is the request?  Has this been part of a long term decision, or a short term response as a result of some traumatic event eg. diagnosis, death of a friend or relative etc.?  Also, when the person thinks of suicide, does someone else come to mind?  Does the person change their mind about suicide a lot?
<br>6. Is the request consistent with a person's basic values?  If there is a discrepancy, can we justify the discrepancy? 
<br>7. How far in the future would the suicide take place?  Is it intended to solve a future problem, the eventual onset of intractable pain or mental deterioration, or to put an end to problems currently occurring?  The triggering event may be difficult for not only the person to justify, but also for others to justify.
<br>8. Are the medical facts cited in the request accurate?
<br>9. How accurate are the other non medical facts cited in the request, for example, that others who assist in an attempt may be subject to criminal penalties, life insurance coverage etc.?
<br>10. Is the suicide plan financially motivated?  This is a very American point where she is asking whether it is intended to avoid catastrophic medical expenses?
<br>11. Has the person considered the effect of his or her suicide on other persons, also the stigma associated with suicide? (x ref the Oregon family clause here and any commentary on stigma)
<br>12. Does the person fear becoming a burden?  Is he or she being manipulated by family members etc. or has there been frank and open communication between the person and their loved ones?
<br>13. What cultural influences are shaping the person's choice?  eg. are religious beliefs, prejudices especially against the handicapped and aged contributing to a feeling of worthlessness?
<br>14. Are the person's affairs in order?
<br>15. Has the person picked a method of committing suicide?  Does the person know what kinds of injuries are likely to result if the attempt is not fatal?  Does the person want to stick to this one method only? If the person hasn't chosen one method does this make them ambivalent about committing suicide at all or is it simply lack of information?
<br>16. Would the person be willing to tell others about his or her suicide plans? 
<br>17. Does the person see suicide as the only way out? 



<p><li>Battin M. Euthanasia: The Way We Do It, The Way They Do It. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management 1991, 6(5):298-305. [compares Netherlands, Germany and USA]

<p><li>Battin M. The Least Worse Death. Hastings Center Report 1983 Apr:13-16.
   safeguards often render natural-death requests and directives cumbersome to execute...
   <br>all the law protects is the refusal of medical procedures.
   <br>The physician is caught in between: he recognizes his patient's right to die peacefully, naturally, and with whatever dignity is possible, but foresees the unfortunate results that may come about when the patient exercises his right as the law permits.
   Which mode of death claims the patient depends in part on circumstance and in part on the physician's response to conditions that occur.
   <br>In the face of inevitable death, the physician becomes strategist, the deviser of plans for how to meet death most favourably. He does so, of course, at the request of the patient, or, if the patient is not competent, the patient's guardian or next of kin.
   A scenario in which natural death is accomplished by the patient's selective refusal of treatment has one major advantage over active euthanasia and assisted suicide: refusal of treatment is clearly permitted and protected by law. Unfortunately, however, most patients do not have the specialized medical knowledge to use this self-protective mechanism intelligently. Few are aware that some kinds of refusal of treatment will better serve their desires for a &quotnatural death&quot than others. And few patients realize that refusal of treatment can be selective.
   <br>patients may be unable to distinguish therapeutic from palliative procedures.
   <br>most patients do not have enough medical knowledge to foresee the consequences of refusing treatment on a selective basis; it is this that the physician must supply.
   <br>though it is crucial in making a genuinely informed decision, the patient's right to information about the risks and outcomes of alternative kinds of refusal has not yet been recognized.
   <br>Consider the bowel cancer patient with widespead metastases and a very poor prognosis who...refuses surgery to reduce or bypass the tumor. How exactly will he die? ... obstruction of the intestinal tract will occur, the bowel wall will perforate, the abdomen will become distended, there will be intractible vomiting (perhaps with a fecal character to the emesis), and the tumor will erode into adjacent areas, causing increased pain, hemorrhage, and sepsis. Narcotic sedation and companion drugs may be partially effective in controlling pain, nausea, and vomiting, but this patient will NOT get the kind of death he thought he bargained for. Yet he was willing to shorten his life, to use the single legally-protected mechanism - refusal of treatment - to achieve that &quotnatural&quot death

<p><li>Battin M. Assisted Suicide: Can We Learn Anything from Germany? Hastings Centre Report March-April 1992; 44-51.
<br>p.44 In a Boston Globe/Harvard survey... 54 percent of a national sample of 1,311 adults over age eighteen said that if they had an illness with no hope of recovery and were suffering a great deal of physical pain, they would or probably would consider asking their doctor to administer lethal drugs or a lethal injection; and 53 percent said that in the same circumstances they would or probably would ask their doctor to prescribe a lethal drug that they could decide to take later on.
<br>p.44 Because the U.S. is so sensitive (as it should be) to the risks of abuse, and because permitting assisted suicide would require a less dramatic change in the law, I think the United States will come to accept assisted suicide in the relatively near future, officially as well as tacitly, but is likely to resist legalizing active euthanasia for a longer time.
<br>p.45 Assisting suicide is not a crime in Germany... provided that the person about to commit suicide is tatherrschaftsfahig, that is, capable of exercising control over his or her actions, and also that he or she acts out of freiverantwortliche Wille, or freely responsible choice.
<br>p.45-46 ...assisted suicide is not illegal but there may be a duty to rescue a suicide in progress. Like U.S. law, German law imposes an obligation to rescue upon specific parties standing in certian professional or personal relationships to other persons; this is the basis of the physician's legal duty to rescue his or her patient. Thus, as one widely prevalent interpretation of the legal situation holds, although the physician is not prohibited from giving a lethal drug to a patient, once that patient has taken the drug and becomes unconscious, the physician incurs a duty to resuscitate him or her. (PARA) These provisions of German law - all currently highly controversial - have the effect of curtailing the role of German physicians in suicide, and tend to insulate the patient from physician aid.
<br>p.46 ...although it apparently would not be illegal for physicians to assist in the initiation of their patients' suicides, as a matter of practice they do not do so.
<br>p.47 Freitod (literally &quotfree death&quot or &quotvoluntary death&quot) is a positive term, free from connotations of either moral wrongdoing or pathology...
<br>p.49 ...because the German practice of assisted suicide, as shaped both by law and by linguistic expectation, tends to minimize the role of the physician, it tends as well to minimize the opportunity for whatever evaluation, counseling, and psychiatric consultation the physician might provide.
<br>p.50 the German tends to respect Feitod, however difficult it may be to say exactly what differentiates this phenomonon from the previous forms of self-caused death, and tends to regard Freitod as a matter of right - that is, to assume that it ought not to be interfered with and that one always has the right to this choice.
<br>p.50 The distinction between suicide as a moral wrong or psychological aberration and as a religiously or altruistically motivated choice is readily marked off in English, but the distinction between suicide as a moral wrong or pschological aberration and an autonomous choice based in personal ideals and values is not.

<p><li>Battin M. Voluntary Euthanasia and the Risks of Abuse: Can We Learn Anything from the Netherlands? Law Medicine & Health Care 1992; 20(1-2):133-143.
<br>p.136. "Not all family life is harmonious, and underlying pathology can often be exacerbated by the stresses of a family member's terminal illness brings. "All right, Granny, it's time to go" is a message we can imagine being conveyed in a variety of ways, exhibiting an entire range from the faintest suggestion to outright coercion.


<p><li>Baume P, O'Malley E, Bauman A. Professed religious affiliation and the practice of euthanasia. Journal of Medical Ethics 1995; 21: 49-54

<br>p.49 Attitudes towards active voluntary euthanasia (AVE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) among 1,238 doctors on the medical register of New South Wales varied significantly with self-identified religious affiliation.
<br>p.52 Of all medical practitioners who had been asked to do so, more than one quarter acknowledged that they had taken steps to hasten death.



<p><li>Beauchamp T., Childress J. (1994) Principles of Biomedical Ethics 4th Edition. Oxford: OUP.
<br>(slippery slope analyses: see p.229)
<br>p.10 "Similarly, the judgement that an act is morally acceptable does not imply that the law should permit it.  For example, the thesis that active euthanasia is morally justified if patients face uncontrollable pain and suffering and request death is consistent with the thesis that the government should legally prohibit active euthanasia because it would not be possible to control abuses if it were legalized. We are not here defending particular moral judgements about the justifiability of such acts. We are maintaining only that the connections between moral action-guides and judgements about policy or law or legal enforcement are complicated and that a judgement about the morality of acts does not entail a particular judgement about law and policy. Factors such as the symbolic value of the law, the costs of a program and its enforcement, and the demands of competing programs must also be considered."
<br>p. 120. "The word autonomy, derived from the Greek autos ("self") and nomos ("rule", "Governance", or "law"), was first used to refer to the self-rule or self-governance of independent Hellenic city-states.  Autonomy has since been extended to individuals and has acquired meanings as diverse as self governance, liberty rights, privacy, individual choice, freedom of the will, causing one's behaviour and being one's own person."
<br>p. 121. "Virtually all theories of autonomy agree that two conditions are essential: 1. liberty (independence from controlling influences) and 2. agency (capacity for intentional action)."
<br>p. 125. "Mill's position requires both noninterference with and an active strengthening of autonomous expression, whereas Kant entails a moral imperative of respectful treatment of persons as ends rather merely as means.  In the final analysis, however, these two profoundly different philosophies both provide support for the principal of respect for autonomy."
<br>p. 145. "Legal, regulatory, philosophical, medical and psychological literatures tend to favour the following elements as the analytical components of informed consent: 1. competence, 2. disclosure, 3. understanding, 4. voluntariness, and 5. consent.  These elements are then presented as the building blocks for a definition of informed consent."
<br>p. 165. [They quote Eliot Freidson:] "It is my impression that clients are more often bullied than informed into consent, their resistance weakened in part by their desire for the general service if not the specific procedure, in part by the oppressive setting they find themselves in, and in part by the calculated intimidation, restriction of information, and covert threats of rejection by the professional staff itself."
<br>p. 165. "Nevertheless, one can easily inflate the threat of control by manipulation beyond its significance in health care.  We typically make decisions in a context of competing influences, such as personal desires, familial constraints, legal obligations, and institutional pressures."
<br>p. 181. "Although we have justified the obligation to solicit decisions from patients by the principal of respect for autonomy, we have acknowledged that the principal's precise demands remain unsettled and open to interpretation and specification."
<br>p. 189. "The principal of nonmaleficence asserts an obligation not to inflict harm intentionally.  It has been closely associated in medical ethics with the maxim primum non nocere: "above all [or first] do no harm."  This maxim is frequently invoked by health care professionals, yet its origins are obscure and its implications unclear.  Often proclaimed the fundamental principal in the Hippocratic tradition of medical ethics, it is not found in the Hippocratic corpus, and a venerable statement sometimes confused with it - "at least, do no harm" - is a strained translation of a single Hippocratic passsage.  Nonetheless, an obligation of nonmaleficence and an obligaton of beneficence are both expressed in the Hippocratic Oath:  "I will use treatment to help the sick according to my ability and judgement, but I will never use it to injure or wrong them."
<br>p. 200. "The customary or usual in medical practice can be relevant to a moral judgement, but it is not by itself sufficient or decisive.  It is customary medical practice to treat a disease by a specific means, but whether this treatment should be repeated for a particular patient depends on the patient's wishes and condition as a whole, not alone on what is customary.  For example, treating pneumonia with antibiotics is usual, but it is morally optional for a patient who is irreversibly and imminently dying from cancer or aids.  Ethical judgement is not reducible to professional custom, concensus, traditional codes, or oaths, as indispensable as these are for some professional contexts."
<br>p. 202. " ...the distinction between ordinary and extraordinary treatment is morally irrelevant and should be replaced by the distinction between optional and obligatory treatment, as determined by the balance of benefits and burdens to the patient."
<br>p. 205. "For some patients the burdens of medically administered nutrition and hydration outweigh their benefits, and no-one should deprive them of the right to refuse treatment.  The obligation to care for patients entails provision of treatments that are in accordance with their preferences and interests (within the limits set by just allocation policies), not the provision of treatments because of what they symbolise in the larger society."
<br>p. 213. "Writings in biomedical ethics that discuss futility often focus on the patient's or surrogate's right to refuse futile treatment.  However, circumstances have increasingly appeared in which the question is whether the physician may or should refuse to provide some treatment.  The fact that a treatment is futile is often said to change the position's moral relationship to patients or surrogates.  The physician is not required to provide such treatment and sometimes is not required to discuss the treatment.  These circumstances commonly involve incompetent persons, especially patients in a persistent vegetative state (PVS), where physicians or hospital policies impose decisions to forego life-support on patients or surrogates.  Increasingly hospitals are adopting policies explicitly aimed to dying therapies that are judged futile by physicians, especially after the therapy has been tried for a reasonable period of time."
<br>p. 214. "Few decisions are more momentous than those to withhold or withdraw a medical procedure that sustains life.  But in some cases it is unjustified for surrogates and clinicians to begin or to continue therapy knowing that it will produce a greater balance of pain and suffering for a patient incapable of choosing for or against such therapy."
<br>p. 220. "Killing represents a family of ideas whose central condition is direct causation of another's death, whereas allowing to die represents another family of ideas whose central condition is intentional avoidance of causal intervention so that a disease or injury causes a natural death."
<br>p. 220. "Both killing by omission and killing by commission can be intentional."
<br>p. 222. "Some persons use the term killing as a normative term of maleficence, parallel to "unjustified homicide or murder".  Justified acts involving the deaths of patients, therefore, logically cannot be instances of killing.  They can only be cases of allowing to die."
<br>p. 223. "In the attempt to protect health care professionals from charges of killing, value judgements about what is (morally and legally) permissable often control our factual judgements about the cause of death."
<br>p.224 [They quote Dan Brock: "Death and Dying", in Medical Ethics, ed. Robert M. Veatch (Boston: Jones and Bartlett Publishers 1989), p. 345.:] "The judgement of a person who competently decides to commit suicide is essentially that "my expected future life, under the best conditions possible for me, is so bad that I judge it to be worse than no further continued life at all."  This seems to be in essence exactly the same judgement that some persons who decide to forego life-sustaining treatment make. The refusal of life-sustaining treatment is their means of ending life; they intend to end their life because of its grim prospects.  Their death now when they otherwise would not have died is self-inflicted, whether they take a lethal poison or disconnect a respirator."
<br>p. 224. "We conclude that the distinction between killing (suicide, homicide, etc.) and letting die suffers from vagueness and confusion.  It is conceptually impossible to classify many acts as instances of letting die without also classifying them as instances of killing.  We have also seen that the language of killing is so confusing - causally, legally and morally - that we should avoid it in discussions of euthanasia and assistance in dying.  It is often morally and conceptually more satisfactory to discuss these issues exclusively in the language of optional and obligatory treatments, dispensing altogether with killing and letting die."
<br>p. 225. "Nothing about either killing or allowing to die entails judgements about actual wrongness or rightness, or about the beneficence or nonmalifecence of the action.  Rightness and wrongness depend on the merit of the justification underlying the action, not on the type of action it is.  Neither killing nor letting die, therefore, is per se wrongful, and in this regard they are to be distinguished from murder, which is per se wrongful.  Both killing and letting die are prima facie wrong, but can be justified under some circumstances."
<br>p. 225. "All instances of killing and letting die, then, must satisfy independent criteria, such as the balance of benefits over burdens to the patient, to determine their acceptability."
<br>p. 226. "If competent patients have a legal and moral right to refuse treatment that involves health professionals in implementing their decision and bringing about their deaths, we have a reason to suppose we have a similar right to request the assistance of willing physicians to help them control the conditions under which they die."
<br>p. 226. "Only a small percentage of patients face overwhelming pain and burdens because pain management and improvements in patients' environments have made circumstances at least bearable for most patients, and hospice environments have improved the care of the dying.  The right to refuse nutrition and hydration also gives many patients the opportunity to control the time of their death.  However, these facts do not provide a decisive reason for prohibiting increased physician assistance in dying.  Some patients cannot be satisfactorily relieved, and in any event there are significant questions about autonomy rights for patients.  If a right exists to stop a machine that sustains life, through an arrangement involving mutual agreement with a physician, why is there not the same right to stop the machine that is one's life by an arrangement with a physician?"
<br>p. 228. "The phrase "assisted death," particularly "physician-assisted death," is now widely used, but it is ambiguous because many modes of assistance exist.  Both assisted suicide and voluntary active euthanasia are instances of assistance in bringing about death.  In assisted suicide, the final agent is the one whose death is brought about, and in voluntary active euthanasia the final agent is another party."
<br>p.228 "We believe that sufficient moral reasons exist in some cases to justify mercy killing and assiste suicide, but these reasons are not necessarily sufficient to support revisions in either codes of ethics or public policies. In addressing whether we should retain or modify some current prohibitions, we therefore need to be clear about whether the topic of discussion is the moral justification of individual acts or the justification of institutional rules and public laws governing practices."
<br>p.88: As long as principles allow room for discretionary and contextual judgement, the ethics of care need not dispense with principles. However, like many proponents of virtue theory, defenders of the ethics of care find principles often irrelevant, unproductive, ineffectual, or constrictive in the moral life. A defender of principle could say that principles of care, compassion, and kindness tutor our responses in caring, compassionate, and kind ways. But this claim seems hollow. Our moral experience suggests that our responses rely on our emotions, our capacity for sympathy, our sense of friendship, and our knowledge of how caring people behave."
<br>p. 8. "Reasons other than incompleteness and lack of stated justification also support scepticism about the adequacy of professional codes in health care.  From the time of Hippocrates, physicians have generated codes without scrutiny or acceptance by patients and the public.  These codes have rarely appealed to more general ethical standards or to a source of moral authority beyond the traditions and judgements of physicians.  In some cases, the special rules in codes for professionals seem to conflict with and even ride more general moral norms.  The pursuit of professional norms in these circumstances may do more to protect the profession's interests than to introduce an impartial and comprehensive moral viewpoint.  Other rules have traditionally been expressed in abstract formulations that dispense vague moral advice open to competing interpretations."
<br>p. 230. "Rules in our moral code against actively causing the death of another person are not isolated fragments.  They are threads in a fabric of rules that support respect for human life.  The more threads we remove, the weaker the fabric becomes."
<br>p. 231. "The ultimate success or failure of these slippery slope arguments depends on speculative predictions of a progressive erosion of moral restraints.  If dire consequences will in fact flow from the legal legitimation of assisted suicide or voluntary active euthanasia, then the argument is cogent, and such practices are justifiably prohibited.  But how good is the evidence that dire consequences will occur?  Does the evidence indicate that we cannot maintain firm distinctions in public policies between patient-requested death and involuntary euthanasia?  Scant evident supports any of the answers that have been given to these questions, so far as we can see."
<br>p. 233. "One reason for a policy of exhausting all alternatives before allowing physicians to engage in active euthanasia is the precariousness of constructing a social or professional ethic on borderline situations and emergency cases.  It is dangerous to generalise from emergencies, because hard cases may make bad social and professional ethics as well as bad law."
<br>p. 234. "If it is morally permissible to unplug respirators and detach intravenous lines knowing that death will eventuate, the logic of our present situation is that we are struggling to preserve as many traditional restraints against killing as we can, consistent with taking a humane approach towards seriously suffering patients and respecting their rights."
<br>p. 240. "In general we have thus far been able to respect the line between unjustifiable and justifiable passive euthanasia in medical practice, and we should similarly be able to hold the line between justified and unjustified assistance for suicide."
<br>p. 262. "Rules of non-maleficence are negative prohibitions of action that must be obeyed impartially, and provide reasons for legal prohibitions of certain forms of conduct.  By contrast, rules of beneficence present positive requirements of action, do not always need to be obeyed impartially, and rarely, if ever, provide reasons for legal punishment when one fails to abide by the rules."  
<br>p. 263. "However, and very importantly, from the fact that morally recommended actions are not strong enough to support legal sanctions, or to satisfy a requirement of impartiality, it does not follow that they are merely moral ideals and are not obligations in the moral life.  Not only are various norms of beneficence obligations, but they can be sufficiently strong obligations that they override obligations of non-maleficence."
<br>p. 270. "Traditionally, codes of medical ethics have inappropriately viewed physicians as independent, self-sufficient philanthropists whose beneficence is analogous to generous acts of giving.  According to the Hippocratic Oath, for example, physicians' obligations to patients represent philanthropy and service, whereas their obligations to teachers represent debts incurred in becoming physicians.  However, physicians and many other healthcare professionals are today deeply indebted to society (e.g. for education and privileges) and to patients, past and present (e.g. for research and "practice").  Because of this indebtedness, the medical profession's role of beneficent care of patients is misconstrued if modelled primarily on philanthropy, altruism and personal commitment."
<br>p. 286. "Some Aids patients want to commit suicide rather than face the process of suffering and dying from their disease, but their medical condition also causes central nervous system complications such as delirium or dementia that may render them unable to make a substantially autonomous choice.  While recognising the case for rational suicide by patients with Aids, one physician contends that from the clinical point of view, careful evaluations of suicide even in terminally ill patients, almost invariably reveal evidence that the suicide occurred as a manifestation of psychiatric disorder rather than rational choice."
<br>p. 395. "Surprisingly, codes of medical ethics have traditionally ignored obligations and virtues of veracity.  The Hippocratic Oath does not recommend veracity, not does the Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association.  The principles of medical ethics of the American Medical Association PMEAMA (AMA) in effect from its origins until 1980 made no mention of an obligation or virtue of veracity, giving physicians unrestricted discretion about what to divulge to patients.  In its 1980 revision, the AMA recommends simply and without elaboration that physicians "deal honestly with patients and colleagues."  By contrast to this traditional disregard of veracity, virtues of candour and truthfulness are among the most widely praised character traits of health professionals in contemporary biomedical ethics."
<br>p. 418. "Rules of confidentiality have long been common in codes of medical ethics.  Requirements of confidentiality appear as early as Hippocratic Oath and continue in the Code of Ethics of the AMA."
<br>p. 464. "In previous eras professional virtues were often integrated with professional obligations and ideals in codes of healthcare.  Insisting that the medical profession's "prime objective" is to render service to humanity, an American Medical Association (AMA) code in effect from 1957 to 1980 urged the physician to be "upright" and "pure in character and .....diligent and conscientious in caring for the sick."  It also endorsed the virtues that Hippocrates commended: modesty, sobriety, patience, promptness, and piety.  However, in contrast to its first code in 1847, the AMA over the years has de-emphasised virtues in its codes.  The references that remained in the 1957 version were perfunctory and marginal, and the 1980 version eliminated all traces of the virtues except for the admonition to "expose those physicians deficient in character or competence."
<br>p. 466. "The virtue of compassion is a trait combining an attitude of active regard for another's welfare with an imaginative awareness and emotional response of deep sympathy, tenderness, and discomfort at the other person's (or animal's) misfortune or suffering."
<br>p. 468. "The virtue of discernment rests on sensitive insight involving acute judgement and understanding, and it eventuates in decisive action."
<br>p. 469. "Trust is a confident belief in, and reliance upon the ability and moral character of another person."
<br>p. 470. "Some writers claim that the first or primary virtue is integrity, because it plays such a central role in healthcare ethics."

<br>p.15 To be autonomous in one's thinking calls for intellectual skills, including the ability to judge when someone else knows better than oneself. But it calls for the ability to control the emotions that prevent those skills from being properly exercised. This is a complex matter. Courage and self-control enter into the forming of judgements as well as into acting upon them. That is one complication. A second is that certain emotions, e.g. fear or impatience, may prevent one from thinking clearly, or thinking at all; as, equally, intense emotions may prevent one from acting as judgement would dictate.

<br>p.406 There still remained thestep of concluding that there was no constitutionally significant difference between refusing lifesaving medical treatment and assisted suicide, but this step did not seem to trouble the court, and it was quickly taken.
<br>p.408 The District Court's quick and untroubled conclusion that there is no legally (constitutionally) significant difference between assited suicide and the termination of medical treatment is also somewhat troubling. It not only goes against the grain of most judgements in the United States, England and elsewhere, it is also contrary to the historical underpinning of the 'right to die' judgements. These judgements were grounded in the common law position that unconsented-to medical treatment, like other unconsented-to touchings, is an assault or battery, and therefore patients have a presumptive right to refuse medical treatment. Whatever the merits of extending this doctrine to the extreme at which medical treatment can be refused in all circumstances, even when death is the likely result (as most United States courts have held), there is no means in logic to extend the right to <i>refuse</i> treatment to include the right to <i>insist on</i> harmful treatment, however little the difference may be in real-life consequences or however formalistic the distinction may seem to some.

<br>p.411 The implications of this judgement are not always recognised. As the Lords concluded that termination of treatment for such patients is in the patients' 'best interests' it would appear that termination of treatment is actually required and not merely permitted, for to do otherwise would be to act against the patients' 'best interests,' and would be a dereliction of the physician's legal and ethical duty.


<p><li>Block S, Billings A. Patient Requests to Hasten Death: Evaluation and
Management in Terminal Care. Arch Intern Med Sep 26 1994; 154: 2039-
2047<br>
p.2039 When patients ask for death to be hastened, the following areas should be
explored: the adequacy of symptom control; difficulties in the patient's relationships
with family, friends and health workers; psychological disturbances, especially grief,
depression, anxiety, organic mental disorders, and personality disorders; and the
patient's personal orientation to the meaning of life and suffering.<br>
p.2040 Patients, in fact, lack the technical knowledge to kill themselves quickly and
comfortably. Botched suicides are feared because they may cause physical suffering,
shame, humiliation, and a deepened sense of helplessness....Well-organized patients
who carefully seek control over their dying are reluctant to embrace a casual,
uncertain scheme to end their lives. The remarkable popularity of 'Final Exit', a manual
for "self-deliverance," testifies to the widespread hunger for certainty about how to
end one's life reliably and painlessly.<br>
p.2040 Sixty percent to 90% of patients with cancer experience pain during the last
year of life, while 10% to 20% encounter pain that is severe or difficult to
control....More than 90% of cancer pain can be readily managed with simple drug
therapies.<br>
p.2040 In the Netherlands, an estimated 85% of patients withdraw their requests for
euthanasia after receiving better symptom control.<br>
p.2043 We have observed that physicians seem most willing to consider carrying out
assisted suicide or euthanasia with patients whom they like or with whom they identify
and with whom they have had intense and often long relationships.<br>
p.2046 When patients receive comprehensive care, requests for hastened death are
very rare. In the extraordinary circumstance when the patient's suffering cannot be
ameliorated within the framework of his or her personal values, we believe that
euthanasia and assisted suicide represent appropriate extensions of palliative care.

<br>p.154 A criticism of advance directives is that they may prohibit treatment that will be highly effective in a particular set of circumstances.
<br>p.155 The Law Commission document concerning medical treatment and mental incapacity suggested that advance directives could be used to refuse treatment. The Commission was of the opinion that advance consent to treatment would not render that treatment lawful.

<br>p.45 The history of rights movements shows that sympathy, even of enlightened people, moves the public conscience or at least custom and legal institutions only slowly when there is not supporting motivation from protests, nonviolent noncooperation, and sometimes violent action.
<br>p.45 One might say that what is important is not the concept of rights, but that the oppressed are resentful and willing to protest, and do so without any feeling of shame - or even disapprove of those among the oppressed who do not speak out.
<br>p.44-45 There is a third benefit of the language of rights, in that, if the explication is correct, it encourages the patients of right-infringing actions to feel resentment, to protest, to take a firm stand. To say "You have a right to this" seems to imply that these attitudes/behaviors are justified.

<p><li>Brett A. Limitations of Listing Specific Medical Interventions in Advance Directives. Journal of the American Medical Association 1991; 266(6): 825-828.
   <br>listing specific interventions in advance does not necessarily enhance self-determination or reduce uncertainty in the decision making.
<br>In summary, the intervention-focussed directive runs the risk of promoting the selection or rejection of interventions because of their inherent characteristics rather than as appropriate means to the ends that the patient would have wanted.
   <br>The SUBSTITUTED JUDGEMENT standard asks the surrogate to make the decision that the patient would have made in the particular situation. This standard is limited by the fact that the surrogate must know something about the patient's prefernces, as expressed when the patient's decision-making capacity was intact. On the other hand, the BEST INTERESTS standard is invoked when the patient's preferences were unknown. This standard, by definition, cannot apply to the patient's preferences. Instead it seeks the surrogate to choose the course of action that promotes the patient's interests according to a more impersonal standard (e.g. that which most reasonable persons would choose).
   <br>Patients, however, do not select or reject diagnostic interventions in a vacuum; they choose interventions according to the clinical context in which they find themselves.
   <br>At first glance, the detailed intervention-focused directive appears to conform to this contextual model. The person is given a clinical context (eg advanced irreversible dementia), and asked whether he or she would choose an intervention (eg, use of antibiotics)...the patient may not want an antibiotic for a virulent pneumonia that will lead to rapid death but would prefer an antibiotic for an indolent pneumonia that is not expected to result in death but is causing an uncomfortable cough and chest pain.
   <br>(on multiple choice LWs)...this complexity does not guarantee improved decision making from a medical perspective, nor does it necessarily increase the certainty that decisions will conform to treatment goals from the patient's presumed perspective.
   <br>The simplest and most practical solution to the problem of advance directives is to encourage wider use of health care proxy directives...
   <br>Another innovation, exemplified in the VALUES HISTORY document, is to focus on those individual values that might be relevant to decisions about life-sustaining treatment.

<p><li>British Medical Association. Euthanasia. London: BMA 1988.
<br>p.67 "An active intervention by anybody to terminate another person's life should remain illegal. Neither doctors nor any other occupational group should be placed in a category which lessens their responsibility for their actions."

<p><li>British Medical Association. Medical Ethics Today. London: BMA 1993.
<br>p.161 ...the Association confirms its commitment to the fundamental right of patients to accept or reject, through advance directives, treatment options offered to them.
<br>p.161 ...the BMA has very strongly recommended that any patients who wish to draft advance directives should ensure that they are well informed and do so with the benefit of medical advice.
<br>p.162 The possibility of patients inadvertantly misdirecting their doctors by an inadequate appreciation of the circumstances or of the evolution of new treatments led the Association to recommend strongly that advance directives should not be legally binding on doctors, but legal cases in 1992 and 1993 indicated that an anticipatory decision which is clearly established and applicable to the circumstances would be as legally binding as any current decision made by a competent patient. (Cases referred to are Re T [1992]4 All ER 649; and Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993]1 All ER 859.)
p.162 The BMA suggests that patients who have drafted an advance directive carry a card indicating that fact as well as lodging a copy with their doctor.
<br>p.162 The BMA recommends that any person making an advance directive updates it at regular intervals. Five years is suggested as an appropriate interval for patients to review their decisions.
<br>p.163 It is not acceptable for doctors to give patients a tacit impression that an advance directive would be respected when the doctor, for reasons of conscience, has no intention of doing so.
<br>p.164 The precise role, powers and title of a proxy decision-maker are not defined by either custom or law (even in Scotland where tutors dative may exercise this role). Pending clarification in law, the BMA believes that in cases where such a person has been nominated by the patient, the criterion to be followed in decision-making would be that of "substituted judgement," with the agent as a sympathetic interpreter of the patient's own values, rather than attempting to judge the patient's best interests.
<br>p.177 In the BMA's view, liberalising the law on euthanasia would herald a serious and incalculable change in the ethics of medicine.
<br>p.177 Effective management of pain and distress which has the side effect of curtailing life, is a necessary form of treatment.
<br>p.177 The Association advises doctors to consider their own views and inform patients at the outset of any absolute objection they might have to the principle of limiting treatment at the patient's request.
<br>p.177 When a decision is reached that it would not be in the best interests of the patient to give life prolonging treatments, the withholding of certain treatments is ethical, provided that caring attention to the patient's comfort is sustained.
<br>p.177 Patients can only make valid choices on the basis of shared information about diagnoses, prognoses and realistic treatment options.
<br>p.178 The BMA strongly supports the principles underpinning advance directives which represent the patients's settled wish regarding treatment choices when the patient is no longer able competently to express a view.
<br>p.178 When preparing an advance directive patients are entitled to receive balanced counselling on the medical issues from their doctor. Discussion between patients and doctors of the specific terms of an advance declaration should be a continuing dialogue.
<br>p.178 The BMA is not in favour of legislation on advance directives.
<br>p.178 It is the responsibility of the patient to ensure that the existence of an advance directive is known to those who may be asked to comply with its provisions. Doctors, having been notified that an advance directive exists, should make all reasonable efforts to acquaint themselves with its contents.
<br>p.178 It is strongly recommended that patients review their advance directives at regular intervals (at least once every five years).
<br>p.178 The Association encourages doctors to raise the subject of advance directives in a sensitive manner with patients who may be thought likely to have an interest in the matter or who are anxious about the possible administration of unwanted treatments at a later stage.

<br>(philosophical)
<br>p.1384 We cannot resolve these moral tensions by making one side of the tension disappear. Instead, we must learn to live with these tensions within a pluralistic society. This requires more reliance on negotiation, compromise, and practical reasoning, and less on abstract ethical theory.
<br>p.1384 I argue here that an adjudication of assisted death might follow from viewing it as a compassionate response to one sort of medical failure, rather than as something to be prohibited outright or as something to be established as a standard policy.
<br>p.1385 To take this case forward requires a case-orientated approach that identifies models of sound ethical practice and then asks whether new, controversial cases resemble those model cases in their most important moral features.
<br>p.1386 The point of calling assisted death a response to a medical failure - the failure of medical interventions to arrange a good death - is to make the strong claim that assisting a death is an admission of incompetent medical practice until proved otherwise. This in turn indicates what sort of medical defense must be offered, in a particular case, to justify the practice.
<br>p.1386 Identifying a psychopathology that interferes with competent decision making but that cannot itself be ameliorated by treatment may be diagnostically elegant but moves the patient no closer to a good death.
<br>p.1387 If the defense of how one has managed a medical failure must occur on a case-by case basis, we cannot construct a statute that would list all possible justifications and restrictions in advance.
<br>p.1387 A good death occurs as much as possible among caring and supportive people. If the law forces already suffering patients to die alone - for fear that seeking the supportive presence of others might implicate them in an illegal act - then the law undermines important social values of family and community.

p.33-34 What if medicine once and for all accepted death as a limit that cannot be
overcome andused that limit as an indispensable focal point in thinking about illness
and disease? The reality of death as a part of our biological life would be seen, not as
a discordant note in the search for health and well-being, but as a foreseeable
endpoint of its enterprise, and its pacification as a proper goal of medicine fromthe
outset. What if the aim of scientific medicine was not an endless struggle against
death, with the fight against disease as the token of that struggle, but helping humans
best live a mortal, not immortal life?<br>
p.34 Medicine's pursuit of health shouild be leavened by its need when health fails, as
it must, to prepare the way for as peaceful a death as possible.<br>
p.34 At present medicine takes as its task only the pursuit of health, or the
preservation of a decent quality of life, with death as the accidental result of illnesses
and diseases thought to be avoidable and contingent, even though in fact still fatal.
Death is what happens when medicine fails.<br>
p.34 In the task of allowing a peaceful death, brinkmanship would be repudiated from
the outset. Active treatment to cure disease and stop death from coming would stop
well short of its technical possibilities, at that point when a peaceful death couod be
most assured and best managed. The worry that a patient might die sooner than
technologically necessary would be actively balanced by anxiety that a patient might
die later than was compatible with a peaceful death.<br>
p.35 The process of dying is deformed when, through overconfidence in our power to
manage technology and to manage our own ambivalence toward death, we fail to take
account of what an overzealous medicine can do.<br>
p.37 A standard of futility compatible with the goal of avoiding an unnecessarily painful
or extended death would be most valuable. The test of futility could be twofold: first,
an inability to arrest more than momentarily (by a few days or weeks) a downward,
deteriorating course; and second, the probability, should that kind of effort be made,
that a peaceful death would become increasingly unlikely. At that point, curative
medical treatment has indeed become futile and ought to be stopped. The standard is
thus one that looks to the possibility of sustaining life in some decent fashion, but
also and simultaneously to the choices necessary for enhancing the possibility of a
peaceful death.<br>
p.38 ...when a patient is incompetent and death on the way, family members should
not be forced, through guilt or a confusion about killing and allowing to die, to believe
that a termination of treatment is wrongful killing. It is not killing at all.

Most medical care in Japan is supported by a system of medical insurance in which palliative care is not sufficiently covered, but curative therapies are.
<BR>It is often assumed that people's greatest fears of dying concern pain and going into hospital. As can be seen from the results, this is the perception of the medical profession and not patients.

<p><li>Choice in Dying, Inc. Refusal of Treatment Legislation - A State by State Compilation of Enacted and Model Statutes. New York: Choice in Dying 1991 
   <br>In 1976, California became the first state to pass legislation that directly addressed decisionmaking on behalf of incompetent patients. The California Natural Death Act allowed individuals, in certain circumstances, to plan in advance for their treatment at the end of life.
   <br>On June 25th, 1990, the United States Supreme Court reached the constitutional question of the &quotright to die&quot in the landmark case of Nancy Cruzan. The Court recognized that every competent individual has a constitutional liberty right to be free of unwanted medical treatment. At the same time, however, the Court left the regulation of this right on behalf of incompetent patients in the hands of the states. As Justice O'Connor noted in her concurrence, &quotToday we decide only that one state's practice does not violate the constitution. The more challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures for safeguarding incompetents' liberty interests is entrusted to the &quotlaboratory" of the states...in the first instance." QUOTING CRUZAN V. DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, 497 U.S. 261,262(1990).
   <br>Following the Cruzan decision, the state legislative laboratories became increasingly active.
   <br>The amendments currently being considered generally expand patients' rights to make end-of-life treatment decisions in advance. In line with this trend is the enactment of the federal Patient Self-Determination Act as part of the 1990 Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act. The PDSA, which went into effect in December 1991, requires health care providers (primarily hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies) to give patients information about their rights to make advance directives under state law; the substance of the law governing advance directives is left to the states. The PDSA also requires care providers to have written institutional policies regarding advance directives and to document whether or not a patient has executed one.

<p><li>Christakis N, Asch D. Biases in How Physicians Choose to Withdraw Life Support. Lancet 1993; 342:642-646.
<br>p.642 Physicians do have preferences about the form of life support withdrawn. From most likely to least likely the order is: blood products, haemodialysis, intravenous vasopressors, total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, mechanical ventilation, tube feedings, and intravenous fluids.
<br>p.642 Four biases in decision making were also identified. Physicians prefer to withdraw forms of therapy supporting organs that failed for natural rather iatrogenic reasons, to withdraw recently instituted rather than longstanding interventions, to withdraw forms of therapy resulting in immediate death rather than delayed death, and to withdraw forms of therapy when confronted with diagnostic uncertainty.
<br>p.642 Because these biases may have clinical, social, and ethical consequences counter to patient goals, and because they may affect the underlying decision whether to withdraw life support at all, they may represent impediments to rational and compassionate decision making on critical care.
<br>p.645 Our research shows that physicians' preferences about the type of life support to withdraw are influenced by iatrogenic complications, duration of therapy with each form of life support, expected timing of death, and diagnostic uncertainty.
<br>p.645 The decision biases that we have identified here may, in some circumstances, prolong the period of dying, increase the suffering of patients and their families, and waste resources.
<br>p.645 Should, therefore, advance directives be drafted to specify how life support could be withdrawn? We think not: rather than seek such specificity physicians should focus on the underlying goals.
<br>p.645 The primary goal in life support withdrawal ordinarily is to allow the patient to die as humanely as possible, and the decision should be made in the most ethically sensitive, logically rigorous, and clinically appropriate way possible. The biases we have identified may subvert this objective.

Uhlmann et al showed that physicians and spouses inaccurately predicted patients' resuscitation preferences. Physicians, who had a median patient-physician relationship of 3.4 years, either significantly underestimated or overestimated patients' preferences for resuscitation in five of six illness scenarios. Spouses significantly overestimated patients' preferences in three of six illness scenarios. Similarly, Ouslander et al found little congruence between decisions made by frail elderly and their closest relative, social worker, nurse, and primary physician. In a study carried out by Zweibel and Cassel, patients and proxies responded to five vignettes about elderly persons who required life-sustaining treatment for survival (ie, ventilation, resuscitation, chemotherapy, amputation, and tube feeding), but were unable to make health-care decisions. The proportion of instances that patients wanted the opposite of what their proxies predicted ranged from 24% for tube feeding to 50% for chemotherapy.

<br>p.25 The fact that Dutch law, by way of case law, has come to tolerate euthanasia and assisted suicide by no means implies that it will tolerate life-terminating acts without explicit request of the patient.
<br>p.26 ...the impression may have arisen that the Dutch began by hastening the end of life on request and ended up with life-terminating acts that the patient had not explicitly requested.

The application of these theoretical responses within hypothetical scenarios to the actual events that occur is a matter of conjecture and speculation. This raises serious questions about the value of executing directives that specify great detail. Indeed, the more detailed an advance directive is, the more likely it is to vary from events that actually occur.

<br>p.130-131 Once public debate has aired an issue, reform generally only proceeds from centrist arguments that are accessible to a broad populace; that juncture may quite probably have been reached on a number of the issues here under discussion, and so the diatribes of 'pro-life' and 'right-to-die' campaigners become tangential amd anachronistic, fuelling the debate but not the reform.
<br>p.131 Political and sociological perspectives may be more important than overreliance on the ability of the law to enable, effect or enforce change...
<br>p.131 ...if developments cannot be predicted with certainty, the need for a consensual approach is emphasized: a) to maximize the chances of reform being implemented; b) to spread the burden of responsibility for reform as equally as possible within the society to which it applies; and c) to minimize any instability following implementation.
<br>p.132 ...protests, opinion polls, eloquent arguments in favour of euthanasia or the more strident demands of voluntary euthanasia societies may provide <i>supporting motivation</i> for change, but the main instruments of reform are likely to be agreements between opposing factions, commonly held values such as compassion, practical caring, shared emotional responses to specific dilemmas and the insights these generate.
<br>p.137[On Advance Directives] As long as basic conditions are fulfilled (that the directive is clearly established and
applicable in the circumstances), their force at common law seems secure: but that the
advance decision <i>was clearly established and applicable in the circumstances, </i>mean, for
instance, that the patient clearly understood the result of refusing treatment, was capable
of making a directive on the basis of such information, and that the instructions clearly
coincide with circumstances in incompetence about which the patient had previously only
hypothesized. That gives us sufficient ground to work out that they are persuasive
legally - as long as the basic conditions are not challenged by medical opinion, or other
evidence. 
<br>p.137 A case known as <i>Re C, </i>hailed by some as an important step forward for advance
directives, was, in fact, only a step forward for advance decisions, and in a lower court at
that. The court was able to establish, for a competent patient, that the decision was
clearly established and applicable in the circumstances, and so make the decision binding
- this facility is not the case for advance directives.

The study found no correlation between moral reasoning and the four empathy subscales: perspective taking, empathetic concern, fantasy, and personal distress. Women had higher DIT amd mostly higher IRI scores than men. Because the two tests require the subject to relate to others based on the principle of justice or empathy, it was concluded that higher scores on the DIT and IRI reflected an other orientation as opposed to self-orientation.

p.7 The vast majority of dementia patients have an experiential world. Unlike Nancy
Cruzan and Karen Quinlan, most dementia patients are subjects with their own

consequences of the treatment decisions made on their behalf. Yet the subjectivity of
the dementia patient is often overlooked in treatment decisionmaking.<br>
p.8 It is indisputably difficult for the competent observer to step into the shoes of a
cognitively impaired individual. Frequently, patients are unable to communicate by using
language. The worlds of those who can speak can be especially difficult to interpret. In
such cases, observers are left to rely on behavioral and physiological data as the
basis for attempting to understand how incompetent patients experience their lives.<br>
p.8 If we adopted the skeptical position regarding our access to impaired patients'
subjectivity, then no one could argue for or against a particular treatment action on
grounds of its affect on the patients themselves. If, on the other hand, we accept that
incompetent patients can be directly harmed and benefited, then we are obligated to
attempt to understand as best we can their subjective experiences.<br>
p.10 It is an intimidating, indeed, frightening responsibility to calculate the overall value
of life for another human being. Both history and current practice reveal too many
examples of its abuse. It is understandable that some would prefer to avoid the
calculation, erring on the side of treating all who cannot decide for themselves. Yet
this "solution" would expose incompetent patients to unjustified experential burdens; it
would also impose severe burdens on patients' families and others without
countervailing benefit to the patients themselves.<br>

enough benefit to outweigh both its customary risks and the distinctive experential
burdens it poses for dementia patients unable to fathom its purpose.<br>

pain, constitute a benefit of any significance to these patients themselves?<br>
p.11 [Many] moderately impaired patients are capable of simple relationships, retain
some memory of the past and concept of the future, can initiate purposeful
movement, or are otherwise able to participate in the lives they are living. A
substantial number are also responsive to rehabilitative and other positive efforts to
improve their quality of life. Although their existence may strike observers as
"degrading" or "undignified," these patients typically are not concerned about such
matters.<br>
p.11 We simply cannot make a defensible judgement about when life-sustaining
treatment would advance an incompetent patient's interest without attempting to
ascertain that patient's subjective reality.

<br>(analysis of Roe v Wade and Casey with reference to appointed circuit judges: pp.8-9)
<br>p.26 Three distinct issues come together in decisions about euthanasia. We must be concerned how best to respect the patient's autonomy, his best interests, and the intrinsic value or sanctity of his life.
<br>p.184   the law produces the apparently irrational result that people can choose to die lingering deaths by refusing to eat, by refusing treatment that keeps them alive, or by being disconnected from respirators and suffocating, but they cannot choose a quick, painless death that their doctors could easily provide.
<br>p.180 Every state in the United States now recognizes some form of advance directive: either &quotliving wills&quot documents stipulating that specified medical procedures should not be used to keep the signer alive in certian specified circumstances, or &quothealth-care proxies&quot - documents appointing someone else to make life and death decisions for the signer when he no longer can. And we all know we may have to make such decisions - as relatives or friends or doctors - for others who have signed no living will or proxies.
<br>p.211 There is no doubt that most people treat the manner of their deaths as of special, symbolic importance: they want their deaths, if possible, to express and in that way vividly to confirm the values they believe most important to their lives.
<br>p.217 Making someone die in a way that others approve, but he believes a horrifying contradiction of his life, is a devastating, odious form of tyranny.
<br>p.225 When a mildly demented person's choices are reasonably stable, reasonably continuous with the general character of his prior life, and inconsistent and self-defeating only to the rough degree that the choices of fully competent people are, he can be seen as still in charge of his life, and he has the right to autonomy for that reason. But if his choices and demands, no matter how firmly expressed, systematically or randomly contradict one another, reflecting no coherent sense of self and no discernable even short-term aims, then he presumably has lost the capacity that is the point of autonomy to protect. Recognizing a continuing right to autonomy for him would be pointless. He has no right that his choices about a guardian (or the use of his property, or his medical treatment, or whether he remains at home) be respected for reasons of autonomy. He still has the right to beneficence, the right that decisions on these matters be made in his best interests; and his preferences may, for different reasons, be important in deciding what his best interests are. But he no longer has the right, as competent people do, himself to decide contrary to those interests.
<br>p.238 People who want an early, peaceful death for themselves or their relatives are not rejecting or denigrating the sanctity of life; on the contrary, they believe that a quicker death shows more respect for life than a protracted one.
<br>p.239 Whatever view we take about abortion and euthanasia, we want the right to decide for ourselves, and we should therefore be ready to insist that any honourable constitution, any genuine constitution of principle, will guarantee that right for everyone.

<p><li>Emanuel L. What Makes a Directive Valid? Hastings Center Report (1994) 24(6):S27-S29.
<br>S27 The theoretical basis for advance directives is that the end of life and the process of death are critical matters that the individual has more right to manage than any other person. The person who leads it, more than any other person, has a rightful interest in moulding the narrative whole that is her or his life.

<br>p.2068 Historically, the ethical justification for proxy decision making inheres in two related claims. First, the incompetent patient's right to refuse medical care can be exercised through a proxy decision. Second, knowing the patient's wishes well, the proxy will make "the decision that the incompetent patient would make if he or she were competent." The proxy decision maker is justified in exercising the incompetent patient's right to refuse care to the extent that he or she can "don the mental mantle" or "stand in the shoes" of the patient and make the same decisions under the circumstances that the patient would. In legal doctrine, this is called substituted judgement.

<br>article also argues a case for &quotdefault proxies&quot)
<br>p.6 ...few people ever use advance directives, and even when they do, physicians do not always honour them. In addition, the documents may be unavailable when relevant.
<br>p.7 Overall, when we combine data we can conclude that living wills and other written instructional directives can be relied on to represent a patient's wishes accurately, under good circumstances, in 46 to 84 percent of decisions. The more serious limitations are that only about 20 percent of the population use them, and the directions of even fewer will be honoured.
<br>p.7 Only half of the patients who designated a proxy in a written document have discussed with that person their preferences regarding specific interventions, such as mechanical breathing or artificial feeding and fluids.
<br>p.8 ...potential proxies are more hesitant to withdraw or terminate life-sustaining treatment than patients are. The burden of decisionmaking is heavy, and produces much greater reluctance to withhold care from a loved one than from oneself.
<br>p.7 ...of the proxies who do manage accurately to judge patients' wishes, less than two-thirds will be emotionally capable of carrying them out.

<p><li>Emanuel L, Emanuel E, Stoeckle J, Hummel L, Barry M. Advance Directives: Stability of Patients' Treatment Choices. Archives of Internal Medicine (1994) 154:209-217.
<br>p.209 Most people made moderately stable decisions when using scenario- and treatment-specific directives, and stability improved after they reviewed the decisions, especially among those who had discussions with their physicians.
<br>p.209 These findings suggest that advance directives can be relied on 1 to 2 years after completion to reflect a patient's choices.
<br>p.209 The common assumption justifying the use of advance directives is that a patient's prior expression of treatment choices accurately represents his or her future choices, that is, they are stable over time.
<br>p.212 Stability was moderate among patients who did not complete high school and was greater among patients with a higher education.
<br>p.216 This finding suggests that treatment directives made in the absence of specific education may reflect autonomous choices somewhat better than proxy decisions if the proxy acts in the absence of specific prior guidance from the patient.

<br>p.524 We found a significant number of cases in which healthcare providers at a long-term care facility came into conflict with surrogates because the treatment desired by the surrogate was viewed as excessively burdonsome when evaluated by an experienced team of nurses, physicians, and social workers. Neither acourt-appointed guardian nor an institutional ethics committee were likely to be able to resiolve these conflicts because of lack of clarity about what constitutes the best interest of impaired nursing home patients.
<br>p.527 The solution to the dilemma  is to develop institutional policies within longterm care facilities that would restrict the scope of treatment decisions made by proxies. Policies would be derived from the experience of a broad spectrum of nursing home staff... caring for patients with severe dementia. They would delineate what constituted an acceptable level of care designed to promote the comfort and well-being of demented patients. Within the context of care plan outlines that insured the goal of patient comfort, proxies would participate in the implementation of specific therapies based on thier view of the importance of the goal of life prolongation.

These results should not be used as a shortcut to determine patient preferences for care, but may provide new insights into the basis for patients' preferences. In discussing choices for future life-sustaining care, physicians need to explore with each individual the basis for his or her choices.

Other advance directives require one to anticipate medical conditions that might arise and to decide in advance what medical treatment one would choose or not choose. No mention is made about who the individual is now, what matters to the individual, or why the individual has made the choices he has - in short, no attention is paid to the only information that is real and not hypothetical. These insights gathered over the past several years may account for the unexpected appeal of the Values History form, especially to persons whose job requires them to encourage others to execute advance directives, such as health care professionals, administrators, pastors, and counselors.

<br>p22 For millenia, medical ethics has focussed on the doctor-patient relationship. Thus the SUPPORT trial to improve clinical decisionmaking for seriously ill patients can be viewed as a report about the failure of this dyadic relationship. ...physicians who are so unconcerned about patient preferences that they don't even bother to look at them when they're placed in the chart, and patients who do not take advantage of opportunities to discuss their treatment preferences with their physicians.
<br>p.23 We must also recognize that families are not simply or even primarily "patient support systems." They must not be thought of or treated that way by doctors, hospitals, health care planners, or bioethicists. To do so is immoral, as Kant made plain. It involves treating the rest of the patient's family as mere means to the preferences of the patient.

The accepted theory of proxy decisions is deeply flawed and must be recast. Our medical practice is, I believe, often better than the conventional theories of proxy decision making. Nonetheless, some of our deepest worries about proxy decision making grow out of the morally inappropriate instructions we give them.

<br>p.10 Our present ethical theory can only condemn as unethical any attempt to weigh in the interests of other family members. If we would acknowledge the moral relevance of the interests of the family we could perhaps develop an ethical theory that would guide and support physicians, patients, and families in the throes of agonisiong moral decisions.

<br>p.173 "With In re Quinlan (1976), it was argued that the constitutionally protected right to die could be exercised by a family on behalrf of an incompetent patient as long as the family could establish that its decision was consistent with the decision the incompetent principal would make if able to do so. This knowledge might include understandings about the principal's religious beliefs, general attitudes regarding medical care, and other substantial (albeit indirect) evidence of that person's frame of mind with regard to right-to-die issues. ... This reasoning would become known as the "substituted judgement" standard, which holds that a third party's best guess about the wishes of the incompetent patient could be substituted for that which was impossible to obtain: the expressed wishes of the patient."
<br>p.173 "The term substituted judgement actually originates with the Massachusetts case In re Spring (1980). In this case, the court decided that a seventy-eight-year-old incompetent individual with end-stage kidney disease could forgo hemodialysis, based on what was known about the individual's general preferences in such matters. No written or specific oral instructions would be required as long as the principal's predisposition toward the withdrawal of life support could be reasonably demonstrated by a third party."
<br>p.173-4 "The "Best Interests" Standard. In another important Massachusettes case, Superintendant of Belchertown State School v. Saikewicz (1977), the court seemed to expand the coverage of the constitutionally protected right-to-die beyond those who were currently incompetent to those who had never been legally competent. Joseph Saikewicz, the principal in this case, had been mentally retarded since birth. But the Massachusettes court hearing the case presumed that those who knew him could reasonably determine what his wishes might be, even though he himself had never been legally competent to make such decisions on his own behalf. Extending the Quinlan rationale to Saikewicz was something of a stretch for the substituted-judgement standard, however, leading the Saikewicz court to introduce the notion that other factors might be considered, including age (Saikewicz was sixty-seven), the pain associated with continued therapyt, the chances for therapeutic success, the suffering associated with the continuation of life, and the inability to cooperate with therapy when in a degraded mental state. This move to consideration of other factors broadened the realm of possibilities for those seeking to establish the right to die, and in the process, it laid the groundwork for what would become a second kind of test: the "best-interests" standard, a term that was actually not coined until the New Jersey court heard the case of Claire Conroy five years later."

patient contemplated the situation which later arose and the consequences of refusing
consent.<br>

<br>p.303 We recognize three stages in the development of advance directive forms in the United States: (1) the legal phase, which focused on the technicalities of constitutional and penal law regarding privacy and professional conduct; (2) the checklist phase, which involved the development of instruments, primary lists, foir assessing patients' values and preferences and integrating them into advance directives; and (3) the story phase, which uses stories to develop value profiles and to integrate them into proxy decision making.
<br>p.313: "Many clinicians, lawyers and ethicists believe that traditional advance directive forms are largely ineffective in providing sufficient information on values, preferences, and guidance for medical intervention. Story-based value assessments and directives and other narrative methods that employ the development, evaluation, and integration of stories into a person's own life story are an alternative to traditional directives. Since story-based assesments and directives do not provide ready-made recipes for medical intervention, they challenge good clinical practice to integrate value assessment with medical assessment and improved physician-patient interaction into on-going stories of cure and care."

<br>p.22 In 1972... the Dutch Reformed Church published a pastoral writing in which voluntary euthanasia was conditionally accepted as a humane way of dying.
<br>p.23 The Dutch healthcare system, unlike that of other countries, provides care for all citizens at a highly advanced level, without exceptions.
<br>p.23 Most people in the Netherlands die at home, being cared for by their general practitioner.
<br>p.23 To investigate the practical matters of numbers and extent, in 1990 the government installed the Commission on the Study of Medical Practice Concerning Euthanasia: the Remmelink Commission.
<br>p.24 Some adjectives used to designate a distinction, for example the terms active/passive and direct/indirect, are considered to be confusing and are left behind as &quotstations passed.&quot
<br>p.24 Euthanasia has come to be defined as &quotIntentionally taking the life of a person upon his or her explicit request by someone else than the person concerned.&quot
<br>p.24 Within the law, the difference between acting and refraining from acting has no particular relevance, and this consideration took precedence over the psychological experience of the difference. Passive euthanasia is self-contradictory because it concerns the omission of a treatment to which the patient has not consented.
<br>p.33 (Commentary Thomasma D pp31-33) The Dutch, unlike Americans, do not practice general medicine as strangers to patients and their values. They are able to construct a value history for the patients who request euthanasia at the end of their lives.

<br>p.63 ...German penal codes, in contradistinction to American law, consider motive in the evaluation of culpability, thus allowing for leniency in spite of the basic rigidity of the law.
<br>p.65 In his private clinic, Hackethal provided a lethal dose of cyanide to an old lady with a massive destruction of her face due to cancer. She had been a long-time patient of his and had explicitly asked to be assisted in ending her life. After the death of the patient, Hackethal publicised the case in numerous press and TV interviews which were followed by his prosecution. The case was later dismissed as abetment of suicide, an action not punishable under German law. This verdict must be seen as a typical instance of current uneasiness in regard to the euthanasia issue: presumed to have been motivated by compassion, Hackethal was exonerated from the charge of practising illegal euthanasia. On the other hand, judgement is issued with the clear understanding that no legal facilitation of mercy killing is intended, and that cases like the present one do not constitute a precedent of any kind. Recently, Hackethal filed a request with the state attorney, and subsequently with the constitutional (supreme) court, to be allowed to offer death assistance to a young woman who is quadriplegic, suffers from extreme pain and wishes to die but is bodily unable to commit suicide. Hackethal's request was denied and unleashed a flood of criticism from medical and eccesiastical officials. Incidentally, recourse to abetment of suicide can hardly be seen as a reliable legal loophole, for the prosecution may easily shift the emphasis fromsuicide to manslaughter and thus lead to a verdict of guilty. Both current legislation and well-meant reform efforts have tried to reduce the vulnerability of abetment but, since at the time suicide is progressively being considered less a free decision and more one of reduced mental incompetence, abetment loses its protective function as it can only be exculpatory when the suicidal individual is a fully competent adult. Because suicidal intentions are always to be considered pathological, a recent textbook on medical ethics justifies brief involuntary commitments in psychiatric clinics for suicide-prone individuals.

<br>p.37 It is not empirically obvious why interests in dignity, the financial well-being of one's family, bodily integrity, and so on, should be said to survive and be applicable to a person who either no longer exists or cannot cognize and presently appreciate these values. Although present practices regarding the use of living wills may go on despite the failure to justify their employment philosophically, such failure would mean that the consensus was forged on a fictitious account of self-determination. Thus, those who argued in the pre-consensus years for the primacy of the best interest standard as the sole standard of decision making would actually be correct.
<br>p.39 ...Buchanan and Brock favour interpreting living wills as embodiments of acts of will rather than evidence of preferences in order to make it more likely that the living wills will actually be employed and given a substantial role in the decision-making process.
<br>p.42 We must make it clear what it means to say that interests &quotsurvive.&quot ... They survive in the memories, both personal and institutional, of the community.

<br>p.43-44 ...we can also make sense of the fact that patients express more confidence in their designated proxy decision maker than seems warranted by current research. The patient's confidence may not be based on the ability of the proxy to give the same answer regarding a treatment choice as the patient would presently give, but rather, the patient is expressing a trust that the proxy can take the patient's character into account and deliberate in a way that will discover a plan of action that generally accords with the patient's values. Thus, the patient's interests, values, and to some degree, personhood, survive in the deliberative process of the proxy.

<br>p.210 Perhaps most dismaying are studies finding that potential surrogate decision-makers often are unable to predict the preferences of their principal. This lack of knowledge bodes poorly for the surrogate decision-maker's ability to exercise accurate substituted judgement. It was against this backdrop of unexpressed and misunderstood desires that the Values History Project was conceived at the Institute of Public Law in 1988.
<br>p.210 While the Institute recommends that traditional advance directives be completed, if appropriate, in conjunction with the Values History, the potential use of the Values History extends beyond the legal limit posed by advance directives.
<br>p.210 The Values History approaches the topic differently than advance directives: instead of asking a person what medical decisions she or he wants made in the event of decisional incapacity, the questions focus on the premises and processes the person uses, and would like used, when deciding om medical treatment. What seems to have been overlooked until now is the recognition that advance directives are syllogisms that ask for medical conclusions. One premise is a not-yet-existent future medical condition or event; the conclusion is the treatment the person does or does not want, at least given today's range of possible options. What is lacking in the syllogism is the other important universal premise: the values that underlie and inform any such decision.

<br>p.1835 The SUPPORT nurses failed to increase discussions between physicians and patients.
<br>p.1835 Assessments of the patient's pain were not provided routinely to the attending physician. Apparently no component of the SUPPORT intervention directly addressed the problem of inadequate pain control.
<br>p.1835-1836 ...merely providing information does not change physician behaviour. Recommendations by consultants in the medical record are often not followed. Providing physicians information about new drugs, vaccines, and practice guidelines does not alter their practice.
<br>p.1836 In retrospect, was it wise to expect to improve care at the end of life without changing the organization and culture of the hospital? Such changes might include conferences on decisions near the end of life, case management meetings regarding individual patients, individual feedback to physicians on their performance, and recognition for clinicians who provide outstanding care at the end of life.
<br>p.1836 Physicians who are local opinion leaders can catalyze colleagues to adopt new clinical practices. A respected senior physician might organize seminars on how to discuss prognosis with patients, elicit their concerns and preferences for care, and negotiate a mutually acceptable plan of care. A physician respected for communication skills could offer to accompany physicians when they discuss patients' decisions about life-sustaining interventions. this "consultant" could help the attending physician address patients' concerns and correct misunderstandings. Respected physicians may have more impact on physician-patient communication than skilled nurses because some physicians may have difficulty accepting suggestions from nurses regarding life-sustaining interventions.
<br>p.1836 Rather than rejecting the ideal of patient autonomy, physicians and hospitals might redouble efforts to make informed consent a reality.
<br>p.1836 Currently physicians receive little practical training on talking to patients about life-sustaining interventions. Residents rarely watch senior physicians hold such conversations and are seldom observed by experienced physicians. More direct supervision and feedback would likely improve these discussions.

   <br>all of us want to exercise control over our own destiny and want to have a chance to finish our own &quotwork of art&quot in our own way.
   <br>On the whole, advance directives...by producing some order in a legally chaotic situation, give some legal protection to physicians and hospitals. Giving such protection, if the shield of protection is used wisely and responsibly, may be an ethically good thing. It may, on the one hand, encourage physician communication and enable patient choice; but, on the other hand, the protection given by this law may be used by institutions and physicians to distance themselves all too easily from a particular patient's particular situation by taking refuge in a generic rule. Medicine does not want to throw out the baby of genuine and ethical caring with the bathwater of physician paternalism.
   <br>Advance directives can help bring about situations in which a dialogue between physician and patient is improved, or they can bring about a situation in which physicians and health care institutions abrogate their responsibility and justify this abrogation by a mere obesiance to the concept of autonomy.
    <br>Ventilators, after all, can be used temporarily (as in anesthesia or to tide a patient over a bout of severe pneumonia) or permanently (as when a patient with chronic lung disease finally becomes and permanently ventilator dependent), or they can, and quite properly so, be used as a comfort measure.

<br>p.166 There is undeniably scope for professional intervention in devising advance directives, and professional cooperation is essential if they are to be implemented.

Logue B. When Hospice Fails: The Limits of Palliative Care. OMEGA (1994) 29(4); 291-
301.
<br>p.292 Although unmanageable patients may indeed be rare in hospice experience, this
is largely attributable to the fact that patients are highly selected for their likelihood to
benefit from hospice's specialized services. That is, those who are unmanageable or
likely to become unmanageable are seldom considered good candidates for hospice.
Moreover, the selection process works both ways: patients who select hospice tend to
be those who find its goals compatible with their own.
<br>p.292 Hospice cannot accomodate all the old, incurably ill, and dying patients who
might conceivably benefit from palliative care. Over two million deaths occur each year
in the United States, whereas hospice programs collectively serve only about 200,000
patiants annually.
<br>p.294 Undoubtedly, some patients and families are quite satisfied with the hospice
choice. But, on average, hospice patients are no more satisfied with their medical and
nursing care than patients in other care settings.
<br>p.294 That some are pleased with hospice services...does not conclusively demonstrate
the desirability of that regimen for every patient. Nor does the existence of satisfied
patients allow us to conclude that other alternatives, such as physician-assisted
suicide, might not be deemed more desireable than palliation were thay to be offered.
<br>p.295 A good death...is under the dying person's control and gives that person time to
settle debts and fulfill obligations. Achieving "closure" is important. The term refers to
settling differences, healing wounds, and closing gaps in human relationships. Closure
is difficult or impossible when the timing of death is uncertain or when the patient is
too physically frail or mentally impaired. To most people, a death without closure is a
bad death.
<br>p.299 Palliative care may well be the best choice for some. But it should not be the
only alternative. Medical realities and the alleviation of pointless suffering necessitate
that policymakers consider options consistent with patient autonomy and the right to
die.

<br>p.22 Dr Charles Killick Millard (1870 to 1952) was medical officer of health for the City of Leicester from 1901 to 1935. In 1931 he drafted the Voluntary Euthanasia Legislation Bill. It did not propose advance directives as such, but set out the bureaucratic machinery for obtaining a 'euthanasia permit'.
<br>p.22 In 1979 the VES adopted a more aggressive approach along with a punchy new name: EXIT. It reverted to its original, more innocuous title in 1983 fololowing a bout of adverse publicity, details of which can be found in the case reports of R v Reed [1982] Crim LR 819, and A-G v Able [1984] 1 All ER 277.

In fact some directives now address themselves to values histories rather than clinical condition and this would be my preferred model. The difference is that the individual describes not which medical conditions he or she would not want to live with, but rather the circumstances in which continued life is not preferable to them - even if something could be done medically."

kept alive, are not unalloyed bonuses, nor is practice value-free. Doctors, lawyers,
ethicists and others recognise that this is the case. But nothing will be solved simply
by changing the way in which decisions are made - say, by removing them from the
courts and bringing them within a legislative structure - unless other principles,
cherished by all jurisdictions form the basis of the decision-making criteria. Legislation
provides the opportunity to create a framework which does not rely on sophistry, and
which also takes account of wider matters. Principles such as transparency and
accountability of decision-making, formal justice and compassion will not inevitably
form any more part of a legislative than a court-based framework, but they could.

<br>p.85 The right to refuse life-sustaining treatment exemplifies a changing accommodation between controversial personal choices and the values our society holds collectively.
<br>p.87 The first difference is the courts' view that a man's opinions are rational and a woman's remarks are unreflective, emotional, or immature. Second, women's moral agency in relation to medical decisions is often not recognized. Third, courts apply evidentiary standards differently to evidence about men's and women's preferences. Fourth, life-support dependent men are seen as subjected to medical assault; women are seen as vulnerable to medical neglect.
<br>p.91 Gender profoundly affects judicial analysis of right-to-die cases. Judicial reasoning about men stresses the role of personal autonomy in these controversial decisions. Judicial reasoning about women examines the role of caregivers.

<br>p.71 Three of the respondents, in particular those who had been involved in more than one assisted death, indicated that they had access to drugs through an underground network. It was mentioned by several that connections were important. Patients who are not well-connected risk having second-rate deaths through the use of second-rate drugs.
<br>p.90 Distressing images equal to those of deplorable back-alley abortions are conjured up by the appalling and torturous conditions amongst which some of the assisted deaths in this study took place. This may make a case for state regulation of euthanasia. The data indicate that individuals are involved in euthanasia and assisted suicide in a completely unregulated, underground environment.
<br>p.90 ...and at the present time it (euthanasia) is happening with no record, no discussion, no consultation, no consistency, no direction, no guidance, and no comfort to the public that it is being done correctly (quoting Tibble & Broadway, 24 Aug 1993 CNS News Ontario, reporting on the 1993 Canadian Medical Association Conference).
<br>p.99 A more suitable alternative (to the Dutch system) is to refer all such cases to a quasi-judicial tribunal that reviews applications for aid-in-dying. The onus would be on the patient to give evidence regarding his or her clinical condition, and consideration must be given to alternative treatments. The application would be completed with the assistance of a professionally trained aid-in-dying counsellor who would evaluate the applicant's ability to give informed consent and ensure that all relevant social, medical and psychiatric inrformation was included. Approved applicants would be issued an aid-in-dying licence, which would allow for voluntary euthanasia to be administered under medical supervision, but not necessarily by a physician.
<br>p.102 Individuals who choose to involve themselves in euthanasia and assisted suicide should be accountable for their decisions. The present legal climate, with its inconsistencies and confusion about killing versus allowing to die, imposes a barrier that precludes any accountability for justified killing.

<br>p.70 Advance-directive discussions about enteral tube feeding and other health care decisions, using understandable hypothetical clinical vignettes that describe risks and benefits that might influence decisions, should be encouraged in the practice of geriatric medicine.
<br>p.73 For the rapidly increasing numbers of people who will live into extreme old age with some degree of cognitive and/or physical impairment, certian types of decisions are probably more importamnt to address in an advance directive than others.
<br>p.73 Decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) among the extremely old and frail geriatric population, especially in nursing homes, may be viewed as moot because of the abysmal survival rate of CPR in this patient population. Decisions about enteral feeding, on the other hand, may be critical because more and more people are living to an age when self-feeding becomes problematic due to advanced dementia, stroke, Parkinson's disease or other conditions.
<br>p.73 ...it is possible to construct a clinical vignette about the decision to accept or forego enteral feeding that generally healthy and cognitively intact elderly people can comprehend and potentially use in making this difficult decision.
<br>p.74 The vignette format lends itself to a thorough explanation of risks and benefits. ... Such explanations may not only be useful when speaking with patients, but with potential proxy decision makers as well.

Such language becomes even more emotive when conjoined with adjectives such as immutable, inalienable, imprescriptible, fundamental and absolute, or with phrases such as "simple and uncontestable principles."
<br>p.71 Although such adjectives (and indeed nouns in seventeenth century usage) make for sloganising, they reflect significant characteristics of human rights and of legal and international rights, as well as aspects of political theory.
<br>p.72 The word "fundamental" as meaning foundation or basis had a long history and was first used by James I who used it in a Scots sense with reference to his right to succession. Subsequently the concept of "fundamental law" was regularly invoked from 1635 onwards in Charles I's struggle with Parliament.
<br>p.72 Fundamental law, taken in conjunction with the ideas of immutability and inalienability, was later translated in the British American colonies into new constitutional arrangements which were scarcely alterable because of the rigid procedures required for constitutional amendment. That is to say, the Constitution and fundamental rights were entrenched, so that their provisions constituted higher or fundamental law, putting them beyond the reach of passing legislatures, temporary expressions of popular sentiment and majority tyranny.

<br>p.1381 Approximately 6000 deaths per day in the United States are said to be in some way planned or indirectly assisted, probably through the &quotdouble effect&quot of pain-relieving medications that may at the same time hasten death or the discontinuation of or failure to start potentially life-prolonging treatments.
<br>p.1382 In physician-assisted suicide, a lethal amount of medication is usually prescribed that the patient then ingests. Since this process has been largely covert and unstudied, little is known about which methods are the most humane and effective.
<br>p.1383 The most pressing problem is the potential abandonment of competent, incurably ill patients who yearn for death despite comprehensive comfort care.
<br>p.1383 Physicians who respond to requests for assisted suicide from such patients do so at substantial professional and legal peril, ofetn acting in secret without the benefit and support from colleagues. This covert practice discourages open and honest communication among physicians, their colleagues, and their dying patients. Decisions often depend more on the physician's values and willingness to take risks than on the compelling nature of the patient's request. There may be more risk of abuse and idiosyncratic decision making with such secret practices than with a more open, carefully defined practice. Finally, terminally ill patients who do not choose to take their own lives often die alone so as not to place their families or caregivers in legal jeopardy.
<br>p.1383 ...there is more risk for vulnerable patients and for the integrity of the profession in such hidden practices, however well intended, than there would be in a more open process restricted to competent patients who met carefully defined criteria.

The intervention group was randomized to receive an educational brochure and encouragement to execute durable health care proxies. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in each group with completed durable health care proxies on file in their primary physicians' offices.
<br>p.2202 Subgroup analysis of elderly patients also revealed no intervention effect. Univariate analysis revealed three significant predictors of patients' proxy completion: patient age, whether patients had discussed directives in hospital with their physicians, and whether patients' physicians completed proxies for themselves. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that these three variables interact to predict the probability of patients' executing proxies.

<br>p.49 With treatment, a patient may recover such that he no longer requires life-supporting treatment. However, his life may be not worth living. If active euthanasia of "non-terminal" patients is prohibited, the option of dying will no longer be available.
<br>p.52 Paradoxically, patients are allowed to die when they are (or would be) very uncertain about the nature of the final outcomes of treatment, but are not allowed to die when it becomes clearer what the nature of their options are.
<br>p.52 Critically ill patients are allowed to die because it is believed that future disabled life is not in their interests. However, there may be considerable uncertainty about the nature of outcomes. While this may be the best guess of what life will be like in the future, it may also be a blind guess. It is likely that some patients are allowed to die when there is some objective chance of a worthwhile future life.
<br>p.71 When treating critically ill incompetent patients, it is commonly argued that we ought to aim to treat the patient as he would rationally desire, or according to his best interests. However, ther is often extreme uncertainty at three levels concerning the outcomes of treatment of critically ill incompetent patients: 
	<br>1. uncertainty about outcomes and their probabilities.
	<br>2. uncertianty about whether this patient would prefer this particular outcome and to what degree he would prefer it.
	<br>3. uncertainty about whether an outcome is in the patient's best interests.
In critically ill competent patients, there is often uncertainty as to whether this patient wants to be treated.
<br>In the face of such uncertianty, subsequent euthanasia can be a valuable prescription for critically ill patients. It allows us to correct the error of treating those whose lives turn out to be not worth living. It also allows us to treat more of those whose lives might be worth living, without the fear that we might be committing them to a miserable existence.
<br>p.72 Paradoxically, it is only with the possibility of death that we can rationally save more worthwhile lives.

<br>p. 40.

<br>p. 103. "The present prohibition against legal assistance in suicide has guaranteed that not a single physician has ever assisted in the death of a patient while following set rules, nor under the observation of her peers, nor under the watchful eyes of the law.  Yet surveys of doctors have found that up to 37% have, in secrecy, aided in the death of a terminally ill patient.  While the public expresses fear of abuse of assisted suicide, no one is overseeing those physicians who have already made aid in suicide part of their medical practice."

<br>($10 study by J Lynne, W Knaus et al. SUPPORT stands for 'Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments.' <i>See also:</i> Jama editorial on this article: Lo, B. Improving Care Near the End of Life)
<br>p.1591 Objectives.- To improve end-of-life decision making and reduce the frequency of a mechanically supported, painful, and prolonged process of dying.
<br>p.1591 Patients.- A total of 9105 adults hospitalized with one or more of nine life-threatening diagnoses; an overall 6-month mortality rate of 47%.
<br>p.1591 Results.- The Phase I observation documented shoprtcomings in communication, frequency of aggressive treatment, and the characteristics of hospital death: only 47% of physicians knew when their patients preferred to avopid CPR; 46% of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders were written within 2 days of death; 38% of patients who died spent at least 10 days in an intensive care unit (ICU); and for 50% of conscious patients who died in the hospital, family members reported moderate to severe pain at least half the time.
<br>p.1591 Enhancing opportunities for more patient-physician communication, although advocated as a major method for improving patient outcomes, may be inadequate to change established practices.
<br>p.1594 Thirty-one percent of phase I patients with interviews preferred that CPR be withheld, but only 47% of their physicians accurately reported this preference during the first interview. Nearly half (49%) of the 960 phase I patients who indicated a desire for CPR to be withheld did not have a DNR order written during that hospitalization. Nearly one third of these patients (278[29%]) died before discharge.
<br>p.1594 In interviews conducted after a patient died, surrogates indicated that 50% of all conscious phase I patients who died in the hospital experienced moderate or severe pain at least half the time during their last 3 days of life.
<br>p.1595 Families reported that half of the patients who were able to communicate in their last few days spent most of their time in moderate or severe pain.
<br>p.1595 Based on a study in a defined population at our Wisconsin site, we estimate that patients meeting SUPPORT criteria account for approximately 400,000 admissions per year in the United States and that another 925,000 people are similarly ill but would not meet SUPPORT entry requirements of being hospitalized or in intensive care. Patients with SUPPORT illnesses and severity account for about 40% of persons dying in the defined population.
<br>p.1596 Can enhanced decision making improve the experience of seriously ill and dying patients?
<br>p.1596 Because there was no movement toward what would seem to be better practices, one could conclude that physicians, patients, and families are fairly comfortable with the current situation. Certainly, most patients and families indicated they were satisfied, no matter what happened to them.
<br>p.1596 Physicians have their established patterns of care, and while they were willing to have the SUPPORT nurse present and carrying on conversations, physician behavious appeared unchanged. Perhaps physicians and patients in this study acknowledged problems with the care of seriously ill patients as a group. However, when involved with their own situation or engaged in the care of their individual patients, they felt they were doing the best they could, were satisfied they were doing well, and did not wish to directly confront problems or face choices.
<br>p.1596 The study certainly casts a pall over any claim that, if the health care system is given additional resources for collaborative decision making in the form of skilled professional time, improvements will occur. In phase II of SUPPORT, improved information, enhanced conversation, and an explicit effort to encourage use of outcome data and preferences in decision making were completely ineffectual, despite the fact that the study had enough power to detect small effects.
<br>p.1596 The five hospitals had been chosen for their diversity and their willingness to undertake a substantial and controversial challenge. Yet none showed a tendency toward improvement in these outcomes.
<br>p.1597 In conclusion, we are left with a troubling situation. the picture we describe of the care of seriously ill or dying persons is not attractive. One would certainly prefer to envision that, when confronted with life-threatening illnesses, the patient and family would be included in discussions, realistic estimates of outcome would be valued, pain would be treated, and dying would not be prolonged. That is still a worthy vision. However, it is not likely to be achieved through an intervention such as that implemented by SUPPORT. Success will require reexamination of our individual and collective commitment to these goals, more creative efforts at shaping the treatment process, and, perhaps, more proactive and forceful attempts at change.

<br>p.59 This study's results confirm the traditional wisdom of using close family members as proxy decision makers, albeit in a limited way. Close family members performed slightly better than physicians in reflecting the elderly person's wishes.
<br>p.59 Even if the appointed person cannot more accurately represent the elderly person's wishes regarding medical treatment, their wishes are being honoured in one respect: the person they prefer is the one making decisions for them.
<br>p.59 ...the major ethical argument in favour of durable power of attorney has been that such appointed agents would be best able to represent the values of the principal... To the extent that such an appointment does not increase the likelihood that the patient's wishes will be carried out, the ethical attractiveness of this mechanism is considerably diminished.
<br>p.60 Clearly, if substituted judgement is the ideal standard of choice for proxy medical treatment decisions, then decision makers should be asked to make the decisions they believe the elderly person would want for themsleves. The study results show that this is not a vain or merely symbolic exercise.

<BR>p.1 To make decisions with your doctor you need to know as much as possible about your health care. Ask your doctor about what you don't understand. Your other health care providers, such as your nurses, social workers, therapists, and chaplains, are also very good sources of information.
<BR>p.1/memo 11-08 1992: If an advance directive lacks internal consistency or directs treatment which falls outside the scope of the standards of medical practice, the case will be referred to the Ethics Committee or to the Chief of Staff.

<br>p.909 Physicians were frequently unaware of their patients advance directives.
<br>p.909 Despite public enthusiasm for the use of advance directives and great efforts to promote them, we found little evidence that these documents are associated with enhanced communication between patients and physicians about end-of-life treatment decisions.

This results in choking and development of aspiration pneumonia. Choking and pneumonia can be prevented by insertion of a nasogastric tube or by feeding a patient through gastrostomy. Both of these strategies increase patient discomfort but allow survival of a patient in vegetative state for years.

<br>p.1346 Since trustworthy empirical data have not been available until recently, moral viewpoints have coloured the estimated numbers of cases of euthanasia (and assisted suicide) and the way in which it is practised. Recent reports, however, have diminished this empirical uncertainty.
<br>p.1346 ...euthanasia is defined as someone other than the patient intentionally ending the life of a patient at the patient's request.
<br>p.1346 Many patients (40%) die at home, especially patinets with cancer (48% of all cancer deaths).
<br>p.1346 Almost all patients (99.4%) have health care insurance, and 100% of the population is insured for the cost of protracted illness. There are no financial incentives for hospitals, physicians, or family members to stop the care of patients. Moreover, the legal right of patients to health care on the basis of their insurance will override budget and other financial agreements.
<br>p.1347 ...euthanasia occurs at home in one of about 25 deaths, in hospitals in one out of 75, and in nursing homes in one out of 800.

<br>p.845 All too frequently, physicians are reluctant to withdraw aggressive treatment from hopelessly ill patients, despite clear legal precedent.
<br>p.848 If there is no treatable component to the depression and the patient's pain or suffering is refractory to treatment, then the wish for suicide may be rational. If such a patient acts on the wish for death and actually commits suicide, it is ethical for a physician who knows the patient well to refrain from an attempt at resuscitation.

<br>p.1332 For the benefit of both patients and doctors euthanasia should be discussed more openly.
<br>p.1333 A sizeable proportion of doctors are asked by their patients to hasten their deaths - 60% in this study, 40% of Australian medical practitioners, and 75% of Dutch family doctors.
<br>p.1333 ...32% of doctors who had faced a request for active euthanasia reported that they had complied with such a request. This proportion is comparable to the 29% of doctors in an Australian study who said that they had taken active steps to end a patient's life.
<br>p.1334 ...the current law on euthanasia is not satisfactory for patients. Patients may be aware that, although they may request active euthanasia, doctors cannot provide it legally; indeed, to raise this issue may be thought to compromise their relationship with the doctor. Conversely, remaining silent may also affect this relationship. A doctor may think that he or she cannot raise the issue for personal, professional, or legal reasons, and so communication between doctors and patients may be blocked.
<br>p.1334 ...the fact that active euthanasia is illegal may deprive dooctors of access to sources of adequate and effective advice and support, both professional and personal.

<br>p.1043 Assisted suicide involves several possible levels of assistance: providing information, for example, may mean providing toxicological information or describing techniques by which soemone may commit suicide; providing the means can involve written prescriptions for lethal amounts of medication; supervising or directly aiding includes inserting an intravenous line and instructing on starting a lethal infusion.
<br>p.1044 By opening the door for counseling or treatment of reversible conditions, requests for assisted suicide might actually lead to averting some suicides which would otherwise have occurred.

<p><li>Weir R. The Morality of Physician-Assisted Suicide. Law Medicine & Health Care. 1992; 20(1-2):116-126.
<br>p.121 A decision made by a patient to forgo mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, or some other life-sustaining treatment involves the <i>negative</i> right (or liberty right) of treatment refusal. A correlate of this negative right is the obligation of the patient's physician not to interfere with or thwart that negative right unless the physician has some overriding obligation of another sort.
<br>By contrast, a request by a patient for a physician's assistance in committing suicide can be interpreted as involving a <i>positive</i> right (or welfare right), or at least a claim to that effect. The difference is important: the patient does not merely request to be left alone by the physician, but tries to impose a moral obligation on the physician to help the patient accomplish the desired end of self-destruction. That claim, whether based on merit or need, is weak, and certainly need not be regarded as imposing an obligation on the physician who receives it.

<p><li>Wellman C. The Inalienable RIght to Life and the Durable Power of Attorney. Law and Philosophy (1995) 14:245-269.
<BR>p.247 Our language of rights is theoretically misleading and unnecessarily controversial in practice because of the way in which we use simple labels or abstract phrases to refer to complex specific rights. What we normally call "the right to life" is almost certainly a rights-package, a cluster of very different rights bundled together because they all concern, in one way or another, someone's life.  [these he enumerates as, 247-249:]
<br>A moral claim-right not to be killed by another
<br>A moral claim-right that others not endanger one's life
<br>A moral liberty-right to defend one's life with all necessary force
<br>A moral liberty-right to defend one's life with all necessary force
<br>A moral liberty-right to preserve one's life by any necessary means
<br>A moral claim-right to be rescued from the danger of death
<br>A moral liberty-right to risk one's life
<br>p.255 There are at least two moral reasons that ground the duty not to kill a human being. One is that the act of killing a human normally results in grievous harm, the loss of a life and thereby the loss of every other value that constitutes that person's well-being.
<br>p.255-256 Another duty-imposing reason is that the act of killing someone is highly invasive; it intrudes into one's life in a disruptive manner and thereby invades the most private zones of the self. The fact that the act of killing a human is harmful and intrusive are specifically moral reasons because they are reasons both for an agent to refrain from acting in that manner and reasons for anyone in society with that agent to react negatively if the agent acts contrary to those reasons. They are reasons for others to act negatively to the killer because his act of killing reveals him to be one who is at least callous and probably hostile and malicious as well as arrogant in the sense of arrogating to himself another's choice whether to live or die.
<br>p.261 When a patient has given consent to medical treatment, that treatment is much less invasive and intrusive because it is friendly rather than hostile and welcome rather than unwelcome.

<br>p.65 It has been estimated that there could be 10,000 cases of assisted euthanasia in the United Kingdom each year.

<br>p.109 Interpreting advance directives, particularly in the light of prognostic uncertainty, can be complex.
<br>p.109 The anxiety of implementing advance directives only underscores the need for efficient and sensitive communication between the patient and the proxy, and the proxy and the physician.
<br>p.112 In many Chinese and Japanese communities, autonomy has different connotations. In these communities, &quotautonomy&quot is to be expressed by the family as a whole rather than by a single designated proxy.
<br>p.112 Truthtelling also holds differing levels of importance in different cultures.
<br>p.112 ...Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Lebanese families who have conspired to keep elderly patients in ignorance of their true diagnosis - principally out of respect.
<br>p.113 Our concern is that indiscriminately posing the same set of questions about advance directives to every patient is entirely likely to inflict unnecessary emotional pain on some; the mentally ill, the elderly, and pregnant women are just a few examples.

<br>p.615 The proportion of respondents reporting having written a living will varied from 4% in the study population reported in this research (Cassel & Zweibel 1987) to 15% in a telephone survey of a random sample of adults conducted by the American Medical Association (Wall Street Journal, 1988) to 17.5% in a sample of older adult research volunteers (High 1988).
<br>p.618 ...the proportion of pairs in which the patient would want the proxy to make a decision opposite the one the proxy reported she would make ranges from 24% for tube feeding up to 44% and 50% respectively for resuscitation and chemotherapy.
<br>p.620 Our findings on preferences for resuscitation tend to support those of Uhlmann and colleagues in the only other study examining the ability of proxies to predict patient preferences for life-sustaining treatment. In both studies, proxies were often unable to accurately report patient treatment preferences.
