<H1> RCE Theory and Design </H1>

<H2> The RCE Rotor Moves Inside an Epitrochoid Curve </H2>

<P> A Rotary Combustion Engine (RCE) as invented by <A HREF =
"dr-wankel.html">Felix Wankel</A> and developed by Walter Froede differs
from a <A HREF = "glossary.html#piston-engine">Piston Engine</A> in four
primary ways:

<UL>

<LI> The RCE Rotor supercedes the piston engine's piston.

<LI> The RCE Eccentric Shaft [<A HREF =
"glossary.html#eccentric">gloss</A>] supercedes the piston engine's
crankshaft and connecting rods.

<LI> The RCE Peripheral Housing [<A HREF =
"glossary.html#peripheral">gloss</A>] supercedes the piston engine's
cylinder.

<LI> Intake and exhaust ports [<A HREF = "glossary.html#port">gloss</A>]
in the housings eliminate valves, camshafts, and timing belts.

</UL>

<P> The Housing shape is an epitrochoid [<A
HREF="glossary.html#epitrochoid">gloss</A>] curve (more properly,
peritrochoid) [<A HREF="glossary.html#peritrochoid">gloss</A>].  It is
generated by rolling a circle around another circle.  The rolling circle
is half the size of the generating circle.  Drexel provides an extended
discussion of the <A HREF =
"http://wwwtdec.coe.drexel.edu/TDEC/MFE/comp_alg/eewm/exploration15/exp15-deriv.html">mathematics</A>
of the epitrochoid curve and the rotor shape.

<P> <STRONG> Java Demonstration of <A HREF="j-epi.html">Generating an
Epitrochoid</A> (about 44 KB) </STRONG>

<H2> The Wankel RC Engine is an Otto Cycle Engine (Four "Stroke") </H2>

<P> <STRONG> Java Demonstration of <A HREF="j-wankel.html">RC Engine
Cycles</A> (about 104 KB) </STRONG>

<H2> There are two main types of RCE </H2>

<UL>

<LI> <A NAME="KKM"> <B> KKM </B> </A> <EM> Kreiskolbenmotor </EM> or
planetary rotation motor (PLM), distinguished by one stationary
peripheral housing.  The rotor moves in an orbit and propels an
eccentric shaft.  This is easier to manufacture, cool, and maintain than
DKM.  Intake and exhaust passages are better.  Better cooling is
achievable.  It is more compact.  Modern rotaries are KKM types.

<LI> <A NAME="DKM"> <B> DKM </B> </A> <EM> Drehkolben Maschine </EM> or
single-rotation engine (SIM), the first RCE, has the distinctive feature
of an inner rotating housing and rotor moving in circular motion around
a fixed central shaft.  This requires disassembling the motor to change
spark plugs, perhaps the main reason it was discarded.  However, DKM is
the smoothest of the two, and high rates beyond 25,000 rpm are possible.
Bearing loads are lighter.

</UL>

<P> The rotary combustion engine must not be confused with "rotary"
aircraft engines which are piston cylinders arranged in a circle.  The
whole engine rotates.

<H2> Advantages </H2>

<UL>

<LI> Light weight and compact.

<LI> Smooth:  no reciprocating motion.

<LI> Extended power "stroke" rotation of the output shaft: 270 degrees
vs. the 180 degrees of a piston.

<LI> Fewer moving parts: no valves, connecting rods, cams, timing
chains.  Intake and exhaust timing are accomplished directly by the
motion of the rotor.

<LI> Flat torque curve because no valves are used.

<LI> Cooler combustion means fewer oxides of nitrogen.  Catalytic
converters lessen this advantage.

<LI> Separation of combustion region from intake region is good for
<A HREF="hydrogen.html">hydrogen</A> fuel.

</UL>

<H2> Disadvantages </H2>

<UL>

<LI> High surface to volume ratio in combustion chamber is less 
thermodynamically efficient.  The Wankel's long and narrow chamber
makes for long flame travel, but this is countered by the Mazda's
two spark plugs (three on some racing engines).

<LI> Higher fuel consumption.  Thus <A HREF="mazda.html">Mazda</A> has
been successful with the <A HREF="rx-7.html">RX-7 sports car</A>, a market
where fuel consumption is less of an issue.  Only 16 years after the
first engine ran, the 1973 oil crisis devastated the RCE before it had
sufficiently developed to become more economical.

</UL>

<H2> History of Rotary Machines </H2>

<P> Designs for rotary engines were proposed as early as 1588 by
Ramelli, though it took the development of the Otto cycle engine in 1876
and the advent of the automobile in 1896 to set the stage for a proper
rotary combustion engine.

<P> Other early designs were made by Huygens in 1673 and Kepler.  James
Watt made a rotary piston steam engine in 1759.

<HR>

<P> Wankel engines use cycloidal gearing, an old and unusual form of
gearing used in watches, Roots blowers, screw compressors, and pumps.
