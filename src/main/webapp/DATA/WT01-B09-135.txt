<h3>Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium</h3><p>

<blockquote>

<B>Project Title: The Northeast Advanced Thermal Management Technology Project<p>
Performing Organization: Evermont
</B>


<P><B>Program Description</B></P>

<P>The Vermont Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project received a grant from the Advanced
Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium
(NAVC) Or the Northeast A>Jvane:cd Thermal Management Technology Project
(NATMTP). NA1~MTP identifies, develops and tests electric vehicle technologies with the
goal of optimizing battery box thermal management, cabin comfort ant vehicle range in
temperatures down to ­20 degree F.</P>

<P><B>Project Activities</B></P>

<P>Data is collected on five 1995 Solectria Force sedans. Four of these vehicles have been
outfitted with electronic data acquisition systems to provide information on vehicle and
battery temperature and performance Data is also collected through manual driver logs;
test course nuns; static heat tests and special studies using temporary data loggers. This
data has been collected, analyzed and displayed in graphs depicting relationships
between temperature and performance.</P>

<P>The Northeast Advanced Thermal Management Technology Project tests and evaluates
the performance of a number of fuel fired heater designs. Fuel fired heaters provide an
efficient use of fossil fuels and eliminate an additional drain on the batteries from having to
heat the vehicle cabins. The Vermont Electric Vehicle demonstration Project invested in
four different fuel­fired heaters to discover the one with optimum performance. An electric
heat­pump was also designed and demonstrated.</P>

<P>The Vermont Electric Vehicle Demonstration Project worked with the U+S. Array Corps of
Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL) to develop a
cabin thermal model and a battery enclosure model. Results from these tests indicate that
battery thermal management systems appear to substantially overcome adverse effects of
cold weather on lead­acid batteries although opportunities exist for optimization through
refinements and energy efficiency improvements.</P>

<P>CRREL also conducted controlled tests on EVermont's electric vehicles to identify friction
and thermal losses. These studies indicate that increased frictional resistance to vehicle
motion accounts for a major reduction in vehicle operating range during winter months.
Some of the increase in friction can be abated by low­viscosity lubricants. Low rolling
resistance tires can also increase range in all weather conditions although they may not
provide adequate traction for winter environments.</P>

<P>The Northcast Advanced Thermal Management Technology Project is also investigating
how heat conservation might be used to heat d vehicle and how to decrease heat loss
through thermal pane installation. targeted cabin heating is being addressed through
heated seats and heated steering wheels.</P>
