ORE. MCOS GEARING UP TO FIGHT PROPOSED END OF CAPITATION

by David McGuire

An Oregon ballot initiative that would effectively end
capitation in the Beaver State has HMO administrators,
employers and primary care physicians concerned about their
futures and the future of the state's healthcare system.

The proposed referendum, which would ban capitation payments
to providers, has garnered nearly one-third of the 76,000
signatures it needs to be placed on the November ballot,
according to Tom Mann, the initiative's campaign director.

The language of the bill -- written by Salem ophthalmologist
Gordon Miller -- establishes five acceptable methods of
reimbursement for providers:  payment for work performed;
hourly wage; prearranged salary/benefits; bonuses based on
work performed; and reimbursement for expenses.  All other
forms of reimbursement, including any newly developed
payment strategies, would be banned.

Should the bill pass, HMO administrators predict premiums
will increase significantly.

The bill would likely precipitate a 10% to 15% increase in
premium rates, says Providence Good Health Plans Executive
Director Jack Friedman.  The state would see an even larger
rise in the cost of serving its Medicare beneficiaries,
where increases in Medicare supplemental and risk plan costs
could go higher than 20%, he predicts.

Oregon Blue Cross/Blue Shield Vice President of Corporate
Development Barney Speight expresses similar concern for the
state's recently restructured Medicaid program, which has
moved 80% to 90% of its eligibles into managed care.

But while Miller agrees that there may be an initial jump in
premium costs, he says the cost of comprehensive medical
care will remain largely unaffected by changes in pay
structure.

"There is no question that if physicians are withholding
care [because of capitation], premiums will be up," he says.
"But as for cost of service, it's a wash."

The Oregon Medical Association hasn't taken sides yet.  But
because of the diversity of its membership, says OMA
Executive Director Robert Dernedde, it's unlikely that the
association would support the initiative.

Miller contends that capitation arrangements are immoral,
saying they cause physicians to withhold care out of
financial interest.

"If you ever say anything different to a patient because of
financial status, you have compromised your medical ethics,"
says Miller, who adds that in an increasingly capitated
market, all doctors will have to meet the contract costs of
the least ethical physician.

"I've always been very deeply disturbed by those
allegations," Speight says.  "[They] paint doctors totally
as economic entities.

"Any reimbursement system is flawed because it's dealing
with human motivations," he adds, who says there is "as much
evil on the fee-for-service side" as there is in capitated
arrangements.

Proponents of the initiative are fairly confident that the
measure will receive enough signatures to make it on the
November ballot, and even those most staunchly opposed to
the legislation seem to agree.

That sets the stage for a sizable conflict come November,
when a wide array of bill opponents could come out against
the legislation.

"I believe there will be an opposition campaign," says
Speight, who adds that employer groups and primary care
physicians would probably be part of a multi-disciplinary
movement against the measure.

PA. BILLS WOULD RESTRICT ER PAYMENT DENIALS FOR MCOS

Pennsylvania managed care plans would have to foot the bill
for an enrollee's out-of-network emergency room care if a
"reasonable person" would believe the symptoms indicated an
emergency, under legislation recently introduced by two
Keystone State lawmakers.

Acting in response to consumer and provider complaints about
MCOs refusing to reimburse enrollees for certain emergency
room services, state Sens. Roy Afflerbach (D-Lehigh-
Northampton) and Jim Gerlach (R-Chester County) introduced
companion legislation Jan. 4 that the two say will better
regulate and define Pennsylvania MCOs' responsibilities.

State MCOs have not taken a stand on the bills, but Gerlach
suspects positions will become clearer as the two pieces of
legislation gain momentum in the Senate.

"You shouldn't be sitting at home with chest pains saying,
'Is this a heart attack or not,'" says Gerlach, adding that
while an MCO's ability to control costs is important, the
lives of patients must take precedent.

Gerlach's S.B. 1356 contains the same language as
legislation introduced in the House by Rep. John A. Lawless
(R-Audubon).  Both apply a "reasonable person" standard to
enrollees who seek emergency care.  Regardless of the final
diagnosis, if it is determined that a reasonable person
experiencing the symptoms described by an enrollee seeking
care would believe it to be an emergency, the patient would
be reimbursed.

"The idea is to make a definition that is standard," says
Gerlach spokeswoman Carol Hilty.  "We don't want to penalize
insurance companies."

Companion ER legislation's requirements even stricter on
MCOs

Afflerbach's S.B. 1357 would extend consumer protection a
bit further than Gerlach's proposal.  If passed, it would
require plans to reimburse enrollees for services performed
to the point when a patient's condition is stabilized.

The bill adds that reimbursement may be refused only if it
is found that the services charged for were not performed.
MCOs may also deny payment for medical screening
examinations in "cases when the plan enrollee reasonably
should have known that an emergency did not exist."

Under S.B. 1357, MCOs that require authorization for payment
would have to maintain a 24-hour hotline for emergency room
providers and enrollees to obtain approval for care.

It also stipulates that a physician and a surgeon be
available to mediate authorization disputes.

If the emergency provider and hotline physician still
disagree over treatment, the MCO would be required to take
over the care of the patient either by sending a doctor to
the location or arranging transfer to a plan hospital.

Neither bill pleases the Pennsylvania Hospital Association,
says its director of state legislation, Kathleen Mebus.
Although the association supports the bills' premise, both
are "Band-Aid remedies" to a more serious problem, says
Mebus.

"We have no utilization review standards in this state,"
says Mebus, who believes that the proliferation of consumer
protection legislation in Pennsylvania only obscures that
fact.

The bills will be assigned to committees after state
lawmakers return to work Jan. 22.

(717)787-1349 and Sen. Gerlach's office at (717)787-1398.

CONSUMERS GIVE FOR-PROFIT HMOS QUALITY EDGE, SURVEY FINDS

Consumers give for-profit HMOs the edge in efficiency, but
believe not-for-profit HMOs are less costly, a study
released by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation finds.
According to the study, most Americans think that, while
for-profit HMOs are generally more efficient and provide
better quality care, not-for-profit HMOs are more community-
based and less costly.  For more information, call (202)347-

CONSUMER PROTECTION REGS "UNIFORM," GHAA/AMCRA SAYS

Disputing a recent study critical of states' HMO consumer
protection regulations, the Group Health Association of
America/American Managed Care and Review Association says
there is a great deal of uniformity in the levels of HMO
regulation and oversight from one state to another.

A study by the Los Angeles-based Center for Health Care
Rights found wide disparities in the level of consumer
protection afforded HMO enrollees in various states (MCO,
Dec. 29).  Study authors further indicated that in most
states the level of protection was insufficient.

Not so, according to the newly merged GHAA/AMCRA, which
released a statement claiming problems with the survey's
premise and methodology.  "To a large extent, I think the
report is misleading," says GHAA/AMCRA Vice President Garry
Carneal.  "More states are up to speed than not."

GHAA/AMCRA says CHCR failed to take into account the
overlapping federal and private oversight measures that
affect HMOs.  By focusing solely on written state
legislation, says Carneal, CHCR reported much wider
disparities than actually exist.

"Fifty percent of HMOs have applied for National Committee
on Quality Assurance accreditation," says Carneal, who adds
that with the combination of federal and state HMO acts,
HMOs are far more closely watched than fee-for-service
insurers.

CHCR defends its study, however, asserting that despite
private accreditation and federal oversight, significant
shortfalls in state legislation in the areas of quality
assurance, information disclosure and grievance procedures
are still very much an issue.

"[GHAA/AMCRA's] assertion is that healthcare is a nationally
regulated industry, and that's just not the case," says CHCR
Counsel Peter Lee.

For more information on the consumer protection study,
contact CHCR at (213)383-4519.  For details, contact

AWP FIGHT HEATS UP AS 1996 LEGISLATIVE SESSION OPENS

Any-willing-provider legislation and its newer cousins,
freedom-of-choice and patient-protection acts, already have
been introduced in at least 21 states, and it's likely that
the proposals will spark spirited fights between bill
proponents and managed care forces in at least a few of
those states, industry officials say.

It's difficult to say where the AWP "hot spots" might be,
says Herb Schultz, director of state advocacy for the Group
Health Association of America/American Managed Care and
Review Association.  The group is tracking 48 bills,
including carry-over legislation from 1995.

Despite the uncertainty, managed care forces in several
states already have geared up to fight it:

*  The Association of HMOs in Michigan met last fall with
state Rep. John Jamian (R), who is interested in drafting
patient protection act legislation.  According to the group,
Jamian assured managed care representatives that he did not
want to write an anti-managed care bill, and said the
legislation would not be a vehicle for an any-willing-
provider proposal.  However, the lawmaker did express
concern about authorization for out-of-panel providers
within managed care organizations, the HMO group said.  The
legislation still is being written, according to a
spokeswoman for the group.

*  In Ohio, businesses, insurers, consumer and labor
organizations have formed a coalition to defeat any-willing-
provider legislation (Managed Care Law Outlook, November
1995).  The group, which calls itself the "Coalition for
Managed Care," will oppose legislative initiatives before
the Ohio General Assembly this year.  Several committees
already are considering AWP bills, according to the group.

*  In Idaho, the Idaho Medical Society has distributed a
draft of a proposed patient-protection act to industry
leaders for comments.  The draft does not include AWP
language, but does have a requirement that all managed care
entities, except those exempt from federal income tax under
IRS code section 501(c)(3) or (4), offer a point-of-service
option to all enrollees.

PSNS, PREMIUM BATTLES AHEAD FOR MCOS IN 1996, EXPERT SAYS

by Russell C. Coile, Jr.

What's in store for managed care organizations in 1996?  The
healthcare market will begin changing dramatically as payers
demand even lower prices and provider-sponsored networks
battle established MCOs for Medicare dollars, predicts
Russell C. Coile, Jr., president of the Health Forecasting
Group, Santa Clarita, Calif.

Competition, capitation and consolidation are at the
forefront of the forces that will drive health trends in
1996.  It's all part of the re-engineering of the American
healthcare market, propelled by payers -- employers,
business coalitions and government -- who are demanding and
getting lower prices and reduced expenditures from the
healthcare sector.

The year ahead will be a war over the premium.  Price wars
between HMOs and insurers are expanding on a national basis.
The decline in HMO/insurance premiums is triggering a wave
of health industry consolidations and deeply slashed
provider payments.  Angered by the cuts, physicians and
hospitals are organizing their own provider-sponsored
networks and fighting back.  The year ahead will be a battle
between providers and payers to control more of the
shrinking premium.

Purchasers will win, providers will lose

Purchasers and government health programs are "winners,"
delighted that national health inflation is coming down.
Corporate health benefit costs rose only 2% from 1994 to
1995, due to widespread switching by employers to managed
care.  Employer-sponsored health costs were one-third below
the level of consumer inflation, according to the
Philadelphia-based Hay Group.

Health plans and providers will be "losers," as price
competition starts a downward spiral for HMO profits and
provider payments.  For the first time in a decade, medical
care prices slipped down to the level of overall consumer
inflation, rising only 0.3% in October 1995, according to
the Wall Street Journal.

Managed care and employer-driven price competition are
slashing health costs.  As recently as 1988, the nation's
healthcare prices were soaring at an annual rate of 14%.
Government payment cuts and private-sector competition are
looming for 1996.  The impact of those trends will ripple
across America's $1 trillion health system, affecting every
hospital, physician, health plan and consumer.

Premium wars could turn ugly

Economic competition between providers and payers --
HMOs/insurers -- over control of the premium could turn ugly
in 1996.  All buyers -- employers, business coalitions and
government programs -- are driving cost competition among
HMOs and insurers.  In 1995, HMO prices fell by 1.2%.  The
down cycle is not over.  Early signals for HMO prices
indicate that health plan premiums will range from no
increases to 2% to 3% rollbacks from 1995 price levels.

In Northern California, which is an emerging "Stage Five"
market including many metropolitan areas with more than 40%
HMO enrollment, the average health plan premium has shrunk
50% in a 10-year period, from $2,460 per enrollee for a
managed care plan in 1986 to $1,260 for HMO coverage in
1995, according to Steve McDermott, CEO of PriMed Inc. and
executive director of the Hill Medical Group, San Ramon,
Calif.  PriMed manages more than 250,000 capitated lives
through a network of 2,160 physicians.

In 1986, hospitals got 41% of the premium, and physician
services accounted for 33%.  Doctors increased their share
of premium to 37% in 1995, while the hospital component
shrank to 30%.  The big winner was the payer, whose
administrative costs and profits grew from 14% in 1986 to
21% today, according to McDermott.

Newt Gingrich:  "Health reform czar"?

Move over Hillary.  Newt Gingrich is the next "health reform
czar" for the 1990s.  The Republican-driven federal budget
reconciliation act of 1996 would end the Great Society
commitment to healthcare for the poor and elderly, according
to the Wall Street Journal.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
(R-Ga.) deficit-reduction proposal is the most sweeping
federal health program reform legislation since 1983, when
Congress converted Medicare to a prepaid health plan.
Wrenching cuts in Medicare and Medicaid spending may total
some $440 billion in the next seven years.  Doctors could
see their federal payments reduced by almost $30 billion,
while hospitals could lose $120 billion or more.

That strategy leans more toward Margaret Thatcher than
Hillary Rodham Clinton.  Medicare and Medicaid would be
privatized, with incentives for conversion to HMOs.

The result would be a multi-tiered health system in which
beneficiaries choose health plans with different coverages,
depending on their ability to pay extra for wider provider
choice or scope of benefits.

Federal budget battles could lead to "unbundled" GOP health
reforms

Extended wrangling between the White House and GOP
Congressional majority could delay -- but probably not stop
-- GOP-led health reform initiatives.  If Republicans cannot
overcome Clinton vetoes, the GOP may take an "unbundled"
approach to health reform, inserting pieces of their health
reform strategy into other legislation.  Key objectives for
Republican health reformers include:

y  Placing spending limits on entitlement programs such as
Medicare and Medicaid.
y  Reducing Medicare and Medicaid spending and holding down
federal expenditures to 4% to 7% annual increases for the
next five to seven years.
y  Conversion of Medicaid to a block-grant program managed
by the states.
y  Conversion of Medicare to a managed care program that
puts HMOs and provider-sponsored networks -- not government
-- at risk for managing health costs.
y  Caps on Medicare hospital and physician payments.
y  Provider-sponsored networks to allow physicians and
hospitals to enroll Medicare beneficiaries without an HMO
license.
y  Small-business insurance reforms to eliminate waiting
periods, pre-existing conditions and experience ratings.
y  Malpractice reform that limits "pain-and-suffering" non-
medical damages to $250,000 per case.
y  Medical IRAs and medical savings accounts.
y  Reducing subsidies for teaching hospitals and
"disproportionate share" facilities.
y  Protecting rural hospitals.

Are PSNs unfair competition -- or MCO business
opportunities?

The "silver lining" in the massive budget reconciliation
bill is congressional support for provider-sponsored
networks.  Here is a compelling rationale for the 3,000
physician-hospital organizations and integrated networks.
PSNs would give physicians and hospitals a new managed care
vehicle to compete for control of the premium.  The PSN
concept may help level the playing field between providers
and payers.

There could be thousands of PSNs competing for certification
by the Health Care Financing Administration to enroll 37
million Medicare beneficiaries.  New competitors would
potentially include an estimated 3,000 physician-hospital
organizations, hundreds of large physician groups and dozens
of regional integrated delivery systems.

Becoming a PSN could be risky business.  PSNs may need more
experienced partners, such as HMOs and insurers, to control
costs and manage the network.  Managing risk will be the
make-or-break challenge of provider-sponsored networks and,
outside of California, most providers have little or no
experience in capitation.

Providers may turn to HMOs and insurers for cost management,
quality control and information systems under a variety of
PSN-HMO arrangements, including those in which providers:

y  "Rent" the HMO/insurer to manage the network, a technique
called administrative services only, in which managed care
plans often contract with self-funded employer health plans.
y  Utilize an independent third-party administrator to link
the provider network contractually, manage contracting and
control utilization and quality.
y  Form strategic business relationships with the
HMO/insurer for management services on a profit-sharing
basis (but no equity sharing).
y  Joint venture with shared HMO/insurer equity in the PSN,
where providers develop the healthcare delivery network and
the HMO/insurer supplies the fiscal and management services.

ARIZONA'S MEDICAID MANAGED CARE SAVING MILLIONS IN COSTS,
GAO SAYS

Arizona's Medicaid cost-containment program has saved the
federal government and the state millions over the past
several years, showing that it's possible to control costs
by fostering competition and monitoring plan performance, a
new government report shows.

The General Accounting Office report, "Arizona Medicaid:
Competition Among Managed Care Plans Lowers Program Costs,"
found that the state succeeded in containing costs by
developing a competitive Medicaid healthcare market in which
health plans that submit capitation rates higher than their
competitors' rates risk losing Medicaid contracts.

The program, Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System,
features a competitive contract award process to purchase
healthcare services from private- or county-operated
healthcare plans.  The capitation rate is set after a
bidding process in which health plans submit separate bids
for each county they want to serve.  For copies of the
report, call GAO at (202)512-6000.
