<html><body><h4>1.     INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>
<h4>1.1  OBJECTIVE</h4>
<p>
The objective of this procurement is to contract with private industry for the provision of waste 
acceptance, transportation, and delivery services, and storage equipment for commercial spent
nuclear fuel.  Provision of these services and equipment will enable the Office of Civilian
Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) of the Department of Energy (DOE) to meet its
obligations as defined in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act as amended.  These services and
equipment will be procured by awarding up to four contracts with each contract covering the
Purchasers' <a href="foot.htm">[1]</a> sites in one or two of the four designated regions identified in Figure 1.1 in the
continental United States; more detailed figures of the regions are provided in <a href="appa.htm">Appendix A</a>.  Each
contractor (hereafter called a "Regional Servicing Agent") shall be responsible for all activities
and services in its region, including the provision of transportation and storage casks, canisters,
storage modules, and ancillary equipment, as required to accept the spent nuclear fuel and
transport it to a designated Federal Facility for storage or disposal.
<p>
<h4>1.2  PROGRAM SUMMARY</h4>
    <p> 
OCRWM is responsible for implementing the provisions of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
(NWPA), as amended.  The NWPA requires, among other things, that the Department provide
for waste acceptance, transportation, and disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) or high-level
radioactive waste from Purchasers who have entered into Purchaser disposal contract(s)<a href="foot.htm">[2]</a> with the
Secretary of Energy for such services.
<p>
Consistent with the NWPA, the Department plans to "... utilize ... private industry to the fullest
extent possible..." for the performance of transportation activities as authorized by Congress.  To
this extent, OCRWM is pursuing an acquisition process that is market driven, that is, OCRWM
will rely on private industry to provide all of the necessary services and hardware items required
to fulfill OCRWM's waste acceptance and transportation mission at competitive prices.  The                               
intent is to develop a market infrastructure to foster competition and innovative approaches to
waste acceptance and transportation services and to produce results at a best value for the
Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program.

<h4>1.3  WORK SCOPE SUMMARY</h4>
<p>
To achieve the intended objectives and to provide capability to respond to contingencies,
OCRWM's waste acceptance and transportation operations have been divided into four regions
(Figure 1.1).  A successful Offeror will be awarded a contract and shall become the Regional
Servicing Agent (RSA) for a designated region and be responsible for performing all planning,
preparations, waste acceptance, transportation and delivery of Purchaser SNF from that region to
a Federal Facility at the rates and from the locations specified in the Regional Waste Acceptance
Schedule <a href="appb.htm">(Appendix B)</a> for that region.  The related work scope for the contracts has been phased
to facilitate contract definition and performance.  The phases are: Phase A - Development of
Servicing Plans; Phase B - Acquisition of Hardware Items and Mobilization; and Phase C - SNF
Acceptance and Transport.  Refer to <a href="4tasks.htm">Section 4.0</a> for detailed requirements.
  <p>        
<h4>1.4  REGIONAL SERVICING AGENT CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS</h4>
<p>
The Concept of Operations which follows summarizes the major operational activities to be
performed by the RSA.  The description begins with preparation for waste acceptance and
continues through delivery of SNF to a Federal Facility.  Although the RSA is responsible for
providing all necessary hardware items, acquisition of hardware items is not included in the
following description of the Concept of Operations.
<p>
<strong> <a name="1.4.1">    1.4.1 </a>    Activities at Purchasers' Sites </strong>
<p>
     The RSA shall provide NRC certified transportation systems suitable for use at 
     Purchasers' facilities for loading of SNF for shipment to the Federal Facility. 
     Transportation systems could include dual-purpose (transport/storage) casks and canister-based transport/storage systems (both hereafter referred to as "dual-purpose systems") and
     transport-only casks for uncanistered SNF.  The first two years of SNF deliveries to the
     Federal Facility will only be in dual-purpose systems.  Thereafter, deliveries may be made
     in either dual-purpose systems or uncanistered SNF transport cask systems compatible
     with the Federal Facility's ability to handle either type of system. 
<p>
     The RSA shall ensure that all SNF designated for loading is in compliance with the
     requirements contained in the SNF Verification Plan  <a href="appc.htm">(Appendix C)</a>.  All necessary
     ancillary cask-handling equipment shall be provided to the Purchaser's site by the RSA. 
     While at the Purchaser's facility, the Purchaser will be responsible for incidental
     maintenance, protection, and preservation of all equipment furnished to the Purchaser by
     the RSA for the loading and shipment of SNF.  Appropriate documentation shall be
     provided by the RSA to the Purchasers to demonstrate equipment compliance with NRC
     regulations.  The RSA shall provide cask-handling training to personnel at sites to be
     serviced.  The casks will be loaded and prepared for off site shipment by the Purchasers
     in accordance with Purchaser's Quality Assurance (QA) procedures and the requirements
     of the NRC Certificate of Compliance.  
     <p>
     The RSA shall conduct, or be responsible for, all shipping arrangements, including the
     provision of appropriate transport carrier services, on-site/near-site intermodal transfer
     services,  advance notifications, in-transit physical protection/escort services, and
     payment of any State-imposed tolls and fees.  The RSA shall determine the transportation
     routes in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the Department of
     Transportation and the NRC and provide descriptions of these routes to the NRC for
     approval.  The RSA shall provide OCRWM information copies of all transportation route
     descriptions prior to their submission to the NRC.  Also, the RSA shall interact with State
     and Tribal governments as necessary to support development and final selection of the
     shipping routes.  The RSA shall accept title to the SNF on behalf of OCRWM and be the
     Shipping Agent for OCRWM.
<p>
   <strong>  1.4.2  Activities During Transport</strong>
<p>
     The RSA shall provide for: in-transit physical protection; continuous tracking of each in-transit shipment; capability to communicate with escorts accompanying in-transit
     shipments and carriers while the SNF is in transit; and any required en route intermodal
     transfer services.  The RSA shall be responsible for payment of all costs related to
     correcting any non-compliance deficiencies and any transportation non-compliance costs,
     including any Federal, State, and Tribal fines or penalties.
<p>
     The RSA shall provide notifications to NRC, OCRWM, the Purchaser, and State and
     Tribal governments in the event of an emergency.  Emergency response will be provided
     by local units of government, States, Tribes, or through appropriate Federal agencies,
     such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, if requested by the State or Tribal
     governments.   The RSA may be requested to provide assistance to the officials in charge
     at the scene of an emergency or accident related to its SNF shipments.  
<p>
     As necessary, the RSA shall provide heavy-haul capability en route to the Federal Facility
     should the Facility not be serviced by a railroad.  The RSA shall interface with the
     Federal Facility Operator to ensure that shipments are coordinated with other shipments
     from other regions.  Delay or postponement of shipments shall be communicated to NRC,
     OCRWM, Federal Facility Operator, States and Tribal units of government. 
 <p>
     <strong>1.4.3     Activities at Designated Federal Facility</strong>
<p>
     The RSA shall be responsible for providing the Operator of the Federal Facility with the
     appropriate storage systems for the SNF being delivered, if required.  Depending on
     storage needs, this will necessitate the provision of either storage modules for canistered
     SNF or single-purpose canisters and storage modules for uncanistered SNF.  Also, all
     required cask-handling or canister-handling ancillary hardware items, such as lifting
     yokes and transfer casks, shall be provided to the Federal Facility Operator by the RSA. 
     The RSA shall be responsible for taking appropriate action to correct non-compliance
     with NRC regulations for any shipment as notified by the  Federal Facility Operator.
<p>
    <strong> 1.4.4     At Regional Servicing Agent Site</strong>
<p>
     The RSA shall prepare and maintain Purchaser Site Service Plans and an integrated
     Regional Service Plan; shall coordinate as required with the Federal Facility Operator and
     other RSAs; and shall arrange for all required services and delivery of all required
     hardware items to Purchasers and the Federal Facility Operator.  The servicing plans shall
     be compatible with the operating capabilities of the Federal Facility and shall reflect the
     Purchasers' and RSA's capabilities to use dual-purpose systems.  The RSA shall prepare
     a QA program, a QA Plan, operating and QA procedures, training materials, conduct
     training of RSA's staff,  and provide QA support for RSA's activities and OCRWM QA
     audit and surveillance activities.
<p>
     The RSA shall be responsible for all cask maintenance, repairs, cleaning, and cask
     reconfigurations.  Such activities shall be conducted at RSA identified facility(ies) as
     required to support RSA's operations.  The RSA shall also be responsible for disposal of
     any waste generated during such maintenance.
<p>
<h4>1.5  QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS</h4>
<p>
OCRWM nuclear activities are subject to  NRC regulations for Quality Assurance (QA).  These
QA regulations and related controls have been implemented throughout OCRWM in the Quality
Assurance Requirements and Description (QARD).  OCRWM procured items and services
subject to NRC regulation that could affect the health and safety of the public must comply with
and be controlled under the applicable provisions of the QARD.  Therefore, OCRWM
contractors performing work on contracts and delivering items and/or services subject to the
controls of the QARD must perform the work in compliance with the provisions of the QARD
and an OCRWM approved QA Program.  The applicability of the specific provisions of the
QARD to the contractor and each of its subcontractors' work is dependent upon the nature of the
work scope and the apportionment of the work scope among the contractor and its subcontractors
and the contractual arrangements between the participants.  The applicable requirements of the
QARD flow from OCRWM to the contractor, who in turn must flow down those specific
applicable QARD requirements to its subcontractors in its subcontracts based on assigned work
scope to the individual subcontractors.
