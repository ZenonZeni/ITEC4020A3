PRESIDENT FACES TOUGH ECONOMIC DECISIONS

President Ion Iliescu is favored to win the September 1996
presidential elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a
majority in Parliament.  Despite growing opposition from all sides,
Iliescu will dominate the government as he tries to move the economy
toward integration with the EU.  The privatization program under way
will have limited success.  Budget cutting and market reforms will be
implemented enough to qualify for assistance from the IMF and the EU
but not enough to greatly improve the business climate.  However, the
economy is expected to grow over the next five years, and inflation
will be brought into more tolerable ranges.
