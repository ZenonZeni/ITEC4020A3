<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Delicious High-Fiber Cookies</CENTER></H2>
        
I consider these my best health convenience <I>food find</I> of the decade. No
sugar, sodium, saccharine, aspartame, or fructose in these wonderful MCT
cakes. They're made with figs, dates, barley, oat bran, amaranth, psyllium,
raspberries, strawberries, and a few other good ingredients, including MCTs
(medium chain triglycerides). It's the last ingredient that sets it aside
from any other <I>good-for-you</I> health bar or cookie. 

<P>MCTs are specialty fats
manufactured from high-grade vegetable oils, having unique properties over
regular vegetable oils. (Coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and butter contain
relatively large amounts of MCTs.) MCTs are not metabolized through your gut
like regular fats and oils but, rather, in your liver, like carbohydrates, so
they are not deposited as stored fat but instead are burned for energy.

<P>     The importance of vitamin E on overall health and longevity is no longer
questioned. We now know, for example, that smoking reduces blood and tissue
levels of vitamin E and that heart disease, our number-one killer, is associated
with vitamin E deficiency. MCTs enhance the absorption of vitamin E. Because
they deliver more energy than glucose, body builders and runners have been using
MCTs as a dense source of easily absorbed, rapidly utilizable energy. 

<P>A study
was done to determine whether MCTs could be of benefit in the control of body
weight by reducing food intake. Thirty minutes after consuming MCTs, subjects
were offered a varied self-selection lunch. The result? A significantly
decreased caloric intake in the lunch. The researchers conclude that MCTs can
reduce short-term food intake in some individuals. Other studies show that
more energy is expended when MCTs are part of the meal, thereby promoting weight
loss. 

<P>In cancerous test animals receiving MCTs, there was a marked reduction in
tumor size. Animal studies show that MCTs do not suppress the activity of
certain membrane enzymes important for immune integrity, as do other fatty
acids.

<P>
        Excellent results have been described in many malabsorption syndromes,
especially in individuals with gluten-induced problems-that is, those who are
sensitive to wheat. 

<P>Each 3-ounce cake provides 16 grams of dietary fiber, 35
grams of complex carbohydrates, and 7 grams of protein. You'd have to go a
long way to find a more healthful and delicious snack. Eat one in place of a
meal or as an afternoon snack to abate late-afternoon fatigue.
