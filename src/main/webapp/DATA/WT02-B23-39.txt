Inc. Announces Software to Serve Smaller Fund Services Companies</FONT></B>
<P>
<B>PITTSBURGH, Pa. - July 25, 1995 - </B>Confluence Technologies,
a Pittsburgh-based provider of software for the mutual fund and
trust industries, announced today that it has made automated distribution
of mutual fund and collective fund information available to smaller
fund complexes, with the introduction of a scaled-down version
of its flagship product, FundStation. Confluence has first installed
this product, which still carries the FundStation name, at Harris
Bank and Trust, N.A., in Chicago. <BR>
<P>
The modified FundStation extracts daily net asset values (NAVs)
for Harris' collective funds used in customers' retirement plans
and transmits them directly to the recordkeeping system used by
Harris' participant recordkeeping vendor. The fully-automated
transfer of information eliminates the need for phone calls, faxes
and manual data entry on both sides of the information exchange.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;As we moved the participant recordkeeping services to a
new vendor, we needed a way to efficiently and easily get NAV
and distribution information to them every day in a timely fashion,&quot;
said Ron Piarowski, Manager of Fund Accounting at Harris Bank.
&quot;The new version of FundStation makes it both easy and cost-effective
to automate this process.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;We have been planning to introduce a version of FundStation
tailored to the needs of smaller fund complexes,&quot; says FundStation
Product Manager, James M. Szuch. &quot;We realize that smaller
shops have the same need to automate the distribution of mutual
fund information as their larger competitors - perhaps more so
- if they are to provide the level of service that will keep them
competitive and satisfy their customers.&quot;<BR>
<P>
&quot;The new version of FundStation is scaled to provide exactly
the features required by the customer, who pays only for the features
he does use,&quot; said Szuch. &quot;Confluence expects that the
continued growth of defined-contribution retirement plans and
the competition driving plans to same-day valuations will create
many opportunities for similar installations of FundStation.&quot;
