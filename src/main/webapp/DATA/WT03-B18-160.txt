<P>Emissions from motor vehicles are only one source of atmospheric pollution
but represent, for the general public, an all too obvious cause for concern.
CONCAWE has always tried to put the contribution of automotive emissions
in perspective and has long advocated the need to study the vehicle and
its fuel as a single 'system'. CONCAWE's Automotive Emissions Management
Group (AE/MG) therefore welcomed the European Commission's 'Auto/Oil' initiative
and many of its fuels and emissions experts contributed long hours to the
European Programme on Emissions, Fuels and Engine Technologies (EPEFE).

<P>An example of how AE/MG and its associated task forces proceed is illustrated
by CONCAWE's EPEFE work on the influence of heavy gasoline components on
exhaust emissions. In the USA, it has been shown that heavy components in
gasoline can increase certain emissions of the US car fleet by 10 to 30
per cent. But not only are US cars different from the European parc, US
gasolines are different too, being in general a wider cut from refineries
because the road fuels demand pattern is very different. This is partly
due to the fact that diesel cars are rare in the US and common in Europe.
Thus a technical information gap needed to be filled and CONCAWE was asked
to respond. The steps taken in this project were as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Defining the question: it was decided that not only the boiling range
(volatility) needed investigation but also the effect of the various chemical
species involved, as both are potentially influential variables. 
<LI>Designing the project: it was ascertained that a 10-car fleet, a 7-fuels
matrix, and measurement of exhaust Hydrocarbon (by species), CO and NOx
were required; the test protocols and so on were identified. 
<LI>Budgeting for costs; identifying a schedule and resources required:
an agreement by CONCAWE's member companies to fund the study was obtained.
<LI>Overseeing the experimental work: this was carried out in the research
laboratories of the members with suitable facilities and with the capacity
to meet deadlines. 
<LI>Analysing the results: statistical techniques were required to separate
out the small fuels effects from the large differences in vehicle performances.
<LI>Peer review and report: CONCAWE reports are generated by task forces
and reviewed by AE/MG and others. One such report recently published shows
in essence that, in the European context, gasoline back end volatility has
only a small and discontinuous effect on exhaust emissions. 
</UL>
<BR>
Although EPEFE was a massive exercise with the two industries (represented
by EUROPIA and ACEA) cooperating at an unprecedented level, it should not
be assumed that the programme was the end of the story. As our understanding
of the environment develops, new potential problems may emerge. That understanding
is not limited to tail-pipe or evaporative emissions but has to take into
account air quality issues and possible health effects. CONCAWE's work is
becoming increasingly multi-disciplinary and this is reflected in closer
ties between AE/MG and the Air Quality and Health Management Groups. The
more 'traditional' role of the Automotive Emissions Management Group continues-AE/MG
and its Task Forces have to keep abreast of other developments, notably:
<UL>
<LI>emissions legislation and test procedures; 
<LI>vehicle and fuel technology; and 
<LI>alternative fuels, particularly natural gas and liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG). 
</UL>
<BR>
Within this portfolio, AE/MG has already embarked on two new projects: 
<UL>
<LI>particulate size and distribution; and 
<LI>cold start emissions.

These projects will encompass both gasoline and diesel vehicles, so two
new Task Forces, staffed by both gasoline and diesel specialists, have been
set up. This is a departure from previous CONCAWE automotive emissions studies,
which tended to focus on either gasoline or diesel fuel. STF-1, the gasoline
emissions group, has met as required over the past 15 years, and the diesel
emissions team (STF-7), which was created some years later, has been equally
active. Some twenty reports have been published and numerous scientific
papers have been presented at such prestigious meetings as those of the
Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). STF-1 and STF-7 are now standing
down and this article provides an opportunity for AE/MG to publicly thank
the Task Force members for all their work.<br>

<B>PARTICULATE SIZE AND DISTRIBUTION</b></CENTER>
<P>The potential health effects of fine particulate matter (Pm) below the
conventional size threshold of 10 microns (Pm10) have become a matter of
increasing interest. On the legislative front, a particulates standard will
be incorporated in the impending Air Quality Framework Directive. In addition,
a recent review by the UK Government has indicated that significant numbers
of particles in this size range are produced by both gasoline and diesel
engines-a move away from the conventional wisdom that diesel engines are
the sole source of automotive particulates. Unfortunately, little sound
information is available on particle size distribution from gasoline or
diesel engines, and measurement techniques are still being developed. Given
the lack of published information relating to this topic in Europe, CONCAWE
has decided that an authoritative scoping study would add to the general
understanding of the subject.<BR>
<BR>
The objectives of the programme are: </B>
<UL>
<LI>To develop information on particulate size, number and mass distribution
from current diesel and gasoline engines, using currently available measurement
techniques. 
<LI>To compare results from different laboratories and establish the best
techniques, with some information on their reproducibility. 
</UL>
<BR>
As a first step, a literature review has been completed which has identified
appropriate generic classes of equipment for measuring automotive particulates.
It was then necessary for CONCAWE to establish the best currently available
test methods for particulate emissions sizing. These techniques are very
specialized, and so it has been decided that the information is best developed
in cooperation with recognized outside experts in this field. Project planning
is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that the programme will be
completed in 1996.<br><br><br>
