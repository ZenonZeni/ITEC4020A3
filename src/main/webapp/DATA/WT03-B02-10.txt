APA STUDY ENCOURAGES PSYCHOLOGICAL STRATEGIES FOR COST CONTROL

     A new study by the American Psychological Association (APA) shows
communications specialists can affect their hospital's bottom line by
encouraging physicians and other medical staff to use self-help
tactics in their demand management programs. 
     "There is growing evidence that addressing the multiple
psychosocial reasons that prompt patients to visit physicians can be
both health- and cost- effective," said Doug Fizel, public affairs
specialist for the APA. 
     "For example, there are patient-specific and disease-specific
communication intervention strategies that can be integrated into
clinical care with the same degree of scientific credibility as
pharmaceutical or surgical interventions." 
     An overall psychological and behavioral management communications
strategy can be used effectively in concert with increased sensitivity
to psychiatric disorders to achieve cost savings, he said. 
     The underlying reasons patients visit physicians are multi-
faceted and often influenced strongly by psychological factors and
behavioral variables, said the study. 
     Acknowledging the success of self-help can have a significant
impact on the type of care given, the efficacy of that care and,
importantly, the bottom line cost of that care, it notes. 
     Improving medical care and reducing medical costs, assert the
authors of the study, can best be accomplished by integrating
psychiatric, psychological, behavioral, and biomedical evaluations and
interventions.

MEDICARE MARKETERS FEEL HCFA'S CRACKDOWN

     HMOs targeting the Medicare population must conform to a battery
of new federal requirements, including submitting their marketing
plans to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) at least 45
days before materials are distributed.
      In the agency's new crackdown on Medicare risk contracts, con-
tractors also will have to provide clear, written descriptions of
their plans for Medicare beneficiaries; notify the public about
enrollment periods; and inform prospective enrollees that contracts
with HCFA may be terminated compliance with the requirements is not
found.
    HCFA, which only recently released its requirements, will supply a
marketing model to contractors upon request and has stipulated that
minor deviations can derail or delay a marketing plan.  
     Medicare-risk contractors would be wise to pay particular
attention to HCFA's "report cards" on, or assessments of, a
contractor's marketing materials, cautioned Lynn Shapiro Snyder, an
attorney with the Washington, D.C., firm of Epstein Becker & Green.

Required and Prohibited Marketing Activities 

     Prohibited marketing activities under HCFA's regulations include
discrimination based on health status; intentionally confusing
beneficiaries; dispensing gifts or payments of above $10 to encourage
enrollment, door-to-door solicitations, and distribution of marketing
materials not approved by HCFA. 
     Violations range from $25,000 to $100,000 per abuse.  A
contractor also can be prohibited from continuing to accept enrollment
applications and payments for enrolled beneficiaries, and may be asked
to cease marketing activities. 
     Medicare-risk contractors must use care in selecting marketing
agents for their plans and should avoid using physicians.  Physicians,
Snyder noted, often are unaware of membership plans' benefits and
costs.
     In addition, a physician's "inside knowledge" of the patient's
health increases the potential for discrimination in favor of
healthier beneficiaries when acting as a marketing agent--a prohibited
marketing activity, Snyder said.
     The best way to avoid such problems:  "Tell your doctors not to
talk about 
Medicare risk contracts," Snyder said.  "Let the marketing department
do that." 
     Taking care with their marketing practices will help contractors
avoid problems that potentially could reflect badly on their status,
said Geraldine Dallek, executive director of the Los Angeles based
Center for Health Care Rights (CHCR).
     "The experiences of CHCR's Health Insurance Counseling and
Advocacy Program (HICAP) and other HICAP programs throughout
California are reflective of very serious problems in the
risk-contracting program that must be addressed," said Dallek whose
group in 1993 published a study on marketing, quality of care and due
process protections in Medicare risk-contract HMOs.
     
Some of the problems the study cited were:
     *  Poorly trained marketing agents; 
     *  Inappropriate financial incentives inherent in the
commission-based compensation of marketing agents; 
     *  Marketing fraud/abuse resulting from these problems; 
     *  Lack of marketing materials in an enrollee's primary language;
and,
     *  HMO delays in disenrolling Medicare members. 

     In a number of documented instances, HMO employees have lied to
prospective Medicare enrollees about the benefits of HMO enrollment,
pressured them to join, enrolled individuals who were unable to make
an informed enrollment decision, and obtained enrollment signatures
under false pretenses, Dallek said. 
     Generally, these problems are prevalent in geographic areas where
beneficiaries have little experience with Medicare HMOs, in areas of
fierce competition for Medicare enrollees, and with HMOs inexperienced
in marketing to this population. 
     Many HMOs pay their marketing agents a commission for each new
Medicare enrollee.  Without proper training and oversight, this
compensation system is a recipe for disaster. 
     For example, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Los Angeles
County Medicare beneficiaries were subjected to massive marketing
fraud by one HMO, she said.
      "Although HCFA was slow to react to this problem, once the
agency took strong action, the HMO changed its agent compensation
system and significantly increased agent training and oversight," said
Dallek.

ONLINE HEALTH SERVICES OFFER TARGET MARKETING

     Providers of healthcare services and pharmaceutical may now be
able to promote their wares by tapping into the interactive healthcare
communications service "Better Health & Medical Forum" on America
Online. 
        Health ResponseAbility Systems Inc. (HRS), a pioneer in
developing online and interactive healthcare communications, started
the Better Health Medical Forum on America Online (keyword: Better
Health), one of the fastest growing areas (with almost 1.4 million
visits per month).
     Under an agreement with Hill and Knowlton Public Relations in New
York City, the company will seek to increase awareness of the forum
and open opportunities for corporate sponsors to underwrite expansion
of the services.
     Corporate sponsors will be able to link advertising and marketing
materials to appropriate areas and to sponsor chat rooms or
informational sites.
     The forum is an easy-to-use, searchable health and medical
information database and service that facilitates "real-time"
communication and information exchange with hundreds of thousands of
individuals across the nation.      
     "Some of the benefits of sponsoring a site is having a captive,
alive audience that is interested in your information.  It is target
marketing," said Allen Douma, creator of HRS.
     For example, Douma said, a pharmaceutical company that spends
thousands of dollars in television advertising for a certain
medication may do better on-line by targeting a select group of
patients that would be interested in it. 
     "We have a very strong community of people who are seeking health
information," said Douma. 
     Although Better Health is one of the most popular sites at AOL,
Douma expects to see a four-fold increase in the number of visits next
year.  
     The forum embraces an integrated, synergistic approach to
informing, motivating and supporting individuals in making more
informed choices about factors that influence health and well-being,
from personal decisions such as lifestyle and self-care, to national
decisions such as health reform, said Elin Silveous, co-founder of the
service.  Silveous started the forum when she discovered she had
multiple sclerosis but could not find an online support group.     
     The forum also offers full-text documents and downloadable
software files spanning the continuum of health topics, from lifestyle
and prevention, to rehabilitation and long-term care.
       
     Following are some of the features the Better Health & Medical
Forum includes:

--  More than 50 Message Boards (See complete list below.  Each
message board can contain up to 50 folders.  Each folder can contain
up to 500 messages.);

--  Thirty five Community Health Forums as part of the Personal
Empowerment Network; 

--  MEDLINE, the world's leading bibliographic database complied by
the National Library of Medicine;

--  Shopping Services (for health educational and related items);

--  Forums for Voluntary Health and Disability Related Organizations,
including: the American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Association
and American Lung Association;

--  Four chat rooms in which more than 250 "LIVE" mutual support and
self-help group meetings or health professional networking meetings
are held each month; and, 

--  Numerous Software Libraries 

    Within the Better Health & Medical Forum, HRS has embedded a
number of additional information and support sources, such as the
Personal Empowerment Network (PEN) and MEDLINE.
     PEN is a community in which members reach out and help one
another in dealing with life's challenges and with the personal--and
sometimes difficult decisions--that influence health and quality of
life.
     PEN offers more than 30 areas of medical special interest,
linking AOL members with information and access to the web.  MEDLINE
provides members with easy-to-use, low-cost access to the database of
the National Library of Medicine.  To obtain free software and free
trial time to peruse the Better Health & Medical Forum, members can
call 1-800-531-2626.


(EDITOR'S NOTE: This week's Ask Your Colleague explores easy ways to
develop a communications plan during a merger or acquisition.
HCPRMN asked Paula Lovell, president of Lovell Communications in
Nashville, Tenn., for her tips.)

What are the first steps in developing an overall communications plan?

     "The most important step to remember is to be in the information
pipe line.  Being part of the management group that is dealing with
the merger first hand will help in getting a handle on the
information. 
     You should get the information first in order to assimilate it
into a communications plan.  By being a member of the "project team"
assigned with working on the merger--you can be in the loop because if
you don't, the information could potentially be leaked.
      The second step is to identify target audiences--Board of
Trustees, stakeholders, stockholders, volunteers, fundraisers, media,
patients and families, physicians and managed-care organizations.
     Then develop a core message and a rationale for merger for each
group. 
     Also, identify the single best ways to communicate your message
with memos, personal phone calls, press releases, advertising,
hospital meetings and advertising.
     Also develop your own communications team--a different team from
the "project team" with your own worker bees. 
     The CEO and the CFO of the hospital would be part of the team. 
He needs to be aware of his role and be provided with press releases
as well as be advised about potential confusion, morale issues, public
empathy for disgruntled employees. 
     He also needs to be prepared for competitors in managed care and
what it means to the business."

When is the best time for an announcement?
     
     "Ideally if you are an organization in the private sector, at the
time the letter of intent is signed, an announcement should be made."

MARKETERS USE LEGACY OF OLYMPIC STAR IN CAMPAIGN

    Capitalizing on the legacy of Olympic athlete and Oklahoma native,
Jim Thorpe, Integris Health's Southwest Medical Center in Oklahoma
City has retained a 95 percent occupancy and attracted younger and
more affluent patients at its new rehabilitation center.
     Not long after the campaign was launched, the referral rate goals
for the Jim Thorpe Rehabilitation Hospital of six to seven new names a
month were surpassed by 30 percent and three months ahead of schedule.
     "A center of excellence was established as evidenced by patients
asking their physicians to refer them to Jim Thorpe," said Sam
Armstrong-Lopez, marketing director for Integris Health.
     The campaign promoted a consistent and unified message of triumph
over adversity in all of its components. 
     Words like "drive, determination, success, legacy and desire,"
which symbolize the Jim Thorpe legacy, were threaded through all
pieces of the campaign."
     "The positive image garnished from the Jim Thorpe Rehabilitation
Hospital campaign will serve as the base for other marketing efforts,"
said Lopez. 
"We will make strides in image enhancements and generate revenue in
other areas for a "halo effect" from the successful launch of the
hospital."
     The $280,000 campaign, which focused on Thorpe's life, used a
multi-phased approach to market assessment and strategy. 
     Phase I, which occurred in the summer of 1994, was a six-step
process that focused on strategic, creative and action-plan
development. 
     Phase II, entailed the print and television production process. 
Some of the photography took place in Denver, including footage
recreating Thorpe as a young athlete. 
     The hospital even went to great effort to find antique athletic
gear and period props for the scenes. 
     Photographs of Thorpe were borrowed from the family and the
Thorpe estate.
     To reach an audience most apt to use or contribute to the
hospital, the campaign--launched two weeks before the rehabilitation
center's grand opening--included print ads touting an open house and
testimonials, an outpatient brochure, physician direct mail series,
patient and volunteer medals and television spots.
     "A pieces approach with an ad here and a brochure there would
have done little to properly position a new rehabilitation hospital. 
Through a comprehensive effort, we were able to leverage the
individual components into a whole that was stronger than the sum of
the parts," said Lopez.   
     "The Jim Thorpe legacy and message of hope, triumph and
overcoming obstacles was versatile enough to reach all of our
audiences as exhibited by the applicability of the creative to the
direct-mail series, brochures and video, community and donor-directed
print ads, patient directed medals and the T.V. spots," Lopez added.

HHS RELEASES PSA ON AIDS

     Amid troubling new evidence of the toll AIDS continues to take on
America's young adults, the Department of Health and Human Services
released a new series of public service announcements urging young
Americans to take personal responsibility for protecting themselves
from HIV.
     The new PSAs entitled "Respect Yourself, Protect Yourself," were
produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  It
shows young adults talking candidly about their sex lives. Young
adults who are HIV educators and service providers, as well as members
of the target audience, worked closely with CDC and its partners to
create the PSAs.
     HHS Secretary Donna Shalala cited data that identify both the
increase in HIV-related deaths among young adults and the ongoing risk
of new HIV infections.  In 1994, AIDS became the leading cause of
death among 25- to 44-year-olds, increasing from 37,000 to 42,000.

GHHA CAMPAIGN COUNTERS CRITICISM

     The Group Health Association of America (GHHA), a Washington-
based managed-care trade group, is planning a campaign to
counteroffense media criticism.  The GHAA is expected to release
details about the effort this month.
     Popular TV series like "ER" have mentioned HMOs negatively, while
surveys have shown that HMO enrollees are satisfied with their quality
of healthcare.

U.S. HEALTHCARE SATURATES CHARLOTTE MARKET 

     Two months after receiving the go-ahead to operate in Charlotte,
N.C., U.S. Healthcare Inc. is living up to its reputation as an
aggressive marketer. 
     The $2.8-billion health maintenance organization has 
saturated the Charlotte market, even the sides of buses.
     "It's pretty typical of what we do," says Vaughan Delk, general
manager for U.S. Healthcare of the Carolinas Inc. 
        "Part of what we're doing is name recognition.  We're not a
household name yet in the Charlotte market, but we certainly plan on
being one."  
      To do so, the Blue Bell, Pa.-based HMO -- which counts more than
2 million members -- took out two-page ads in The Business Journal and
The Charlotte Observer announcing its arrival.  "The Whole Town's
Jumpin' As Charlotte Welcomes
U.S. Healthcare," its first ad read, only days after receiving
approval from state regulators. 
      One media reporting service estimates the HMO spent $155,000 on
TV spots in Charlotte in October alone.  In Atlanta, the HMO devoted
nearly $1.2 million to its marketing efforts in a quarter, according
to a statement filed with the Georgia Insurance Department. That total
includes salaries for a staff of about 20.  By comparison, Kaiser
Permanente, Georgia's largest HMO, reports spending $5.4 million on
marketing in all of 1994.

KIOSKS EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR HEALTHCARE MARKETERS 

     The newest tool in healthcare marketing is the use of interactive
kiosks or "ATMs" for marketing programs.
         Market research firm Intelco Corp., based in Norwalk, Conn.,
predicts that the number of installed multi-media kiosks will grow 69
percent this year from 125,000 units last year to a total of 211,000
units.
        Blue Cross Blue Shield in Massachusetts (BCBSMA), for example,
has a group of kiosks called "Health Navigator" which allow a
company's employees to view information about various health insurance
plans, select a plan and even select a preferred doctor.
     "It is a virtual-reality customer service center in a kiosk which
uses attractive graphics, high-quality digital video, sound and
animation to communicate with the consumer," said Ethel Shepard,
BCBSMA spokesperson.
     The Health Navigator kiosk is transportable and provides a
variety of essential healthcare information, ranging from primary care
physician directories, prescription and over-the-counter drug
information, wellness surveys and health and wellness articles.
     In addition, members can easily obtain a print-out of their
member profile and can even change their primary care physician by
selecting the "Members Only" function and swiping a member ID card.
     "Health Navigator reflects our growing confidence in technology
to meet the needs of our customers," said William Van Fassen, BCBSMA
president.  "We are entering a new era for health care and healthcare
technology.  This system will lower our administrative costs and
provide critical health information for our customers when and where
they need it." 
     An interactive video host guides the user through the available
options; the user requests information via a touch-screen monitor.  
     The kiosk provides laser quality print-outs as well as a phone
handset for using a touch screen monitor.  It also provides laser
quality print-outs for direct access to BCBSMA customer service
representatives.
     Greg Swistak, president of Factura Inc., a kiosk maker based in
Rochester, N.Y., believes his company's kiosk sales will grow 50
percent.  The company has installed 30 percent of the 100,000 kiosks
now in operation in the United States.  Swistak created the BCBSMA
kiosk.
     Health Navigator leverages the health information highway
technologies that are already in place--connecting health care
providers and the business communities and BCBSMA's mainframes, said
Shepard. 
     Kiosks may be expensive depending on their capabilities.  The
minimum cost is $750, and a touchscreen monitor is between $700 and
$1,000. 
     A personal computer which sits inside the kiosk may cost about
$1,500 and a printing device could add another $1,000.  Depending on
the choice of hardware, an individual kiosk may cost between $4,000
and $20,000.  And then there is also the cost of designing the
software to interact with a kiosk user which depends 
on a company's computer expertise.  

     Some of the information available on the Healthcare Navigator
kiosk includes:

     *  Descriptions of available health plans;
     *  Information about such special programs as safety helmet
discounts, health fitness network, Caring Program for Children,
preventive time lines for adults and children, fitness and eyewear
networks, Living Healthy Books and Living Healthy Magazine.
     *  Primary Care Physicians Directories, which provide users with
an up-to-date list of available and appropriate PCP's located near
their homes or work.

DIRECT MAIL WORKS WITH SENIOR MEDICARE MARKET

     When selling Medicare risk products to the senior and baby boomer
market, traditional marketing techniques such as seminars may not lead
to success.
         "Medicare risk products present a very new challenge. 
Marketers must learn to target their senior market one by one,
recognizing the needs of the individual, not a group," said John
Harrison, president of DiMark Inc., a database marketing outsource
company, in Langhorne, Pa.
     "It is in this venue that a database marketing strategy, and the
use of direct marketing techniques, will make the difference between
success and failure in Medicare risk marketing."
     A database marketing strategy allows Medicare risk marketers to
collect marketing data on an individual prospect or customer basis, to
respond to the needs of their customers.
     Direct marketing provides the tools to implement a database
marketing strategy.
     "Insurance marketers have traditionally relied on a two-tiered
approach, utilizing personal sales and seminars to attract and sell
prospects.  When a marketer, however, adds direct marketing to the
mix, a dual purpose is served," said Harrison. "These techniques
provide a means of targeting the senior market and, in some cases,
successfully enrolling these individuals through a one-step sales
process.
     For the balance of the market, which relies on the personal touch
of seminars and sales representatives, direct-response techniques
offer a cost-effective means of generating leads.
