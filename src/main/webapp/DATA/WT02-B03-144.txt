<H1>Victory in the CDA Case!</H1>
<P>
On Wednesday June 12 at 9:00 am, a panel of three federal judges in Philadelphia, PA granted the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition's (CIEC) request for a preliminary injunction against the Communications Decency Act (CDA). In a unanimous decision, the judges ruled that the CDA would unconstitutionally restrict speech on the Internet.

<h2>Petition Update</h2>
<p>
The petition in support of Senator Leahy's alternative is now closed. The petition generated over 115,000 signatures in just over 5 months! Thank you to those who signed -- <b>YOU MADE A DIFFERENCE!</b>  During the Senate debate on the CDA on June 14 1995, Senator Leahy displayed the over 1500 printed pages to his senate colleagues on the Senate Floor. And the petition was a critical factor in persuading 420 members of the House of Representatives to pass the Cox/Wyden bill.

As the House and Senate move toward a conference committee agreement, the net.community must be ready to turn up the pressure. Please continue to visit this page, as well as the <a href ="petition.html">petition page</a>
