How Small-Stock Funds Can Fit Into Your Investment Portfolio </H2><P>
<HR>

It pays to think small if you're working with a long-term investment horizon. Since 1926, the stocks of smaller firms have averaged about two percentage points more in compound annual total return than large firms.<p>


How small is "small"?<p>


Although the cutoff point for small stocks is really not hard and fast, "small" companies range from under $10 million in market capitalization for obscure, embryonic firms to about $600 million.<p>


For individuals who want to invest a portion of their equity holdings in small firm stocks, mutual funds are ideal, since diversification is particularly important: Small firms often have a difficult time obtaining capital, have erratic growth, may be run by inexperienced people, are threatened by devastating competition from larger companies, and their shares can be highly illiquid and volatile.<p>


Small-stock mutual funds generally focus on Nasdaq and stock exchange-listed firms whose market caps place them in the bottom fifth of the New York Stock Exchange. But many fund managers mix in at least a few mid caps and possibly even some big caps in their portfolios. Some managers who do not ordinarily initiate new positions in larger companies may hold on to good performers that grow to market values of $10 billion or more. Others may follow a policy of selling stocks that outgrow their definition of "small."<p>


Small-cap funds can be categorized in various ways. The simplest way is to begin in terms of the investment strategy: For instance, is it growth-oriented or value-oriented? A fund's composite portfolio price-earnings ratio tells a lot about where it falls within the range from the extremes of pure growth to pure value.<p>

<strong>Growth And Aggressive Growth:</strong>Most small-cap portfolios have a growth orientation. Their managers seek companies whose earnings are expected to ratchet upward at a high rate. These stocks generally have above-average price-earnings ratios, and therefore possess above-average risk when the small-cap market gets overheated. Small-cap growth funds differ in terms of their aggressiveness and the size range of firms targeted. A number of funds labeled as "aggressive growth" also target small caps. Aggressive growth managers may, for example, place big bets on sectors such as technology and healthcare in their quest for maximum capital gains.<p>


<strong>Value:</strong> An increasing number of funds have a value orientation. They look for firms that are cheap in terms of their price-earnings ratios and other valuation yardsticks. These portfolios can also benefit from the "low price-earnings ratio effect," another stock market anomaly. Academics have found that diversified portfolios of low price-earnings ratio stocks tend to outperform average or high price-earnings ratio portfolios. In an efficient market you should not expect any differences in the risk-adjusted performances of high and low price-earnings ratio portfolios.<p>


<strong>Equity Income:</strong> A special breed of small-cap value funds is the small company equity-income portfolio. In addition to their primary objective of capital appreciation, these funds search for higher yields. Besides holding the common stocks of small companies, these portfolios may contain lesser investments in preferred stocks, convertible bonds or stocks of bigger companies to prop up their yields. The tilt toward yield should make these funds less volatile than the typical small-capitalization fund.<p>


<strong>Blended: </strong>Growth and value investing are by no means mutually exclusive. Some small-cap funds blend the styles. They represent a kind of compromise for those who are not sure whether to buy a growth or value fund.<p>


<strong>Index: </strong>Several small-cap index funds are also available. Some argue that an index portfolio doesn't make as much sense for small stocks since astute managers should be able to locate and profit from potential inefficiencies in small, under-followed companies. However, because transaction costs are relatively high for small stocks, too rapid a turnover can zap any excess returns the manager is able to garner. In addition, in the relatively inefficient small-cap market, some portfolios are bound to significantly underperform their peers and the Russell 2000; investing in an index fund ensures that you are not part of that underperformance. <p>


As well as examining the customary data, such as past performance, volatility of returns, expenses, turnover, and management tenure, prospective small-cap investors should consider how big a small-cap fund is and the size of the companies in which it invests.<p>


Why is portfolio size important? Mutual funds with assets of $200 million or less have an easier time investing in truly small stocks, which tend to be illiquid. It's hard for a large mutual fund to buy or sell a meaningful amount of a small firm's stock without affecting its price. Small portfolios are easier to maneuver and their holdings can be limited to several dozen of the manager's favorites. Large funds may end up holding hundreds of stocks and be burdened with superfluous diversification.<p>


Of course, there's more to any fund than its size. Some stock funds that remain very small (with assets below, say, $10 million) are lemons. They perform poorly, have high expenses and, consequently, never attract assets. Funds with poor track records have a tendency to continue their poor performance and turn investors off.<p>


The average market capitalization of the firms a fund holds is also important. You can get a broad feel for this by examining the prospectus or contacting the fund. When examining a listing of the fund's holdings, the fewer names you recognize, the smaller the stocks. But it's best to use a more precise indicator, such as a median market capitalization figure.<p>


Currently, the average median market capitalization for small-stock funds is $584 million, according to Morningstar Mutual Funds. Only a small number of funds have median market caps below $100 million.<p>


At the other end of the range, those with median market caps above $1 billion typically have substantial representations of mid-size and large companies in their portfolios. Incidentally, a few funds with words like "emerging growth" in their names have relatively high median market caps. Fund names and labels can be misleading. Of course, there's nothing necessarily wrong with a fund that targets small, medium, and large companies if you're looking for that mix.<p>


Here are some points to keep in mind when investing in small-stock funds.<p>

<ul>
<li>Check to see whether the manager focuses on growth, value or both. If you want to have two small-stock funds, it's wise to have one of each. The two styles tend to be in vogue at different times.<p>


<li>Examine the portfolio's sector weightings. Small-stock funds that place big bets on a few high-growth sectors are going to have more volatility.<p>


<li>Find out the fund's total assets. With upward of $250 million to $300 million in assets it becomes increasingly more difficult for a fund to function as a true small-cap portfolio.<p>


<li>Try to determine what the fund considers "small." Funds that target the smallest firms will have median market capitalization below $200 million.<p>


<li>Check the expense ratio and portfolio turnover. Funds with very low total assets can have expense ratios of 2% or more. In addition, too high a turnover can eat into your returns since transaction costs are greater for small stocks.<p>


<li>Who is the manager? The manager's skills are very important when it comes to small-cap funds. See how long the manager has been with the fund.<p>


<li>A good index fund can be a wise choice for small-stock investors. You avoid the risk of investing in a fund that significantly under-performs its benchmark.<p>


<li>In gauging performance of small-stock funds compare them with the appropriate peers and indexes. For example, a value fund should be compared with other value funds. The best index to use is the Russell 2000. Its past annual returns can be found in AAII's Individual Investor's Guide to Low-Load Mutual Funds. Daily values appear in The Wall Street Journal.<p>


<li>Dollar cost averaging is a sensible strategy to use with small-stock funds because of their greater volatility. Putting a modest sum away monthly makes a great deal of sense. You get more shares with your fixed sum of money when prices are down, and you need not worry about timing.<p>
