<P>
<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the TVX Gold Inc conference call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. John Hick Vice-Chairman of TVX Gold Inc. Please go ahead Mr. Hick.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Thank you operator. Ladies and gentlemen good morning and welcome to the call. With me today in Toronto is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Eike Batista, our new operating management team of David Murray, Cliff Davis and Ken Sangster who I'll say more about in a minute. Rogerio Berto our Senior Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer. Albrecht Schneider our Senior Vice-President of Exploration and Ed Baer our Manager, Investor Relations. The main purpose of the conference call today is to introduce the new senior operation team of TVX. Also to discuss the press release that we distributed last night regarding the update of Kassandra, and then to discuss and take questions on TVX generally. Dealing with the new operating team, just a few words and background about them. David Murray who is now President and Chief Operating Officer of TVX. David brings to TVX over 25 years of mining industry related experience as well as a strong leadership in operations and project management. Prior to joining us at TVX he held the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of RTZ Mineracao in Brazil whose interests include the $230 million dollar Fortaleza Nickel Mine and the Brasilia mine in which TVX has a one third interest. David was responsible for the $400 million dollar development and operation of the Neves Corvo underground copper tin mine in Portugal during his tenure with RTZ, and for that achievement he was named the "Order of the British Empire". Cliff Davis who is Senior Vice-President, North America and as you'll hear later North America in our terms includes Russia. Cliff joined us from Echo Bay Mines where he held the position of Vice-President Projects since 1992. Prior to that he also was involved with the RTZ group, joining them in 1979. In 1985 he took over the operations of Neves Corvo in Portugal as Project Manager where he later held the position of Production Manager and went from there in 1989 to become General Manager of Kennecott Corporation's Greens Creek, a lead-zinc-silver-gold mine in Alaska, and then General Manager of Kennecott's Ridgeway gold mine in South Carolina. Ken Sangster joins us from Otokumpu Oy where he's been since 1990 holding senior executive positions responsible for, among other things, the development of the $600 million dollar Zaldivar mine and processing plant in Chile which is a 50/50 joint venture between Otokumpu Oy and Placer Dome. Prior to that he too spent time with RTZ, joining RTZ Metals Europe in 1975 as Group Technical Director where he was responsible for, among other things, the recommissioning of the Weeljame tin mine in Cornwall. Technical representation on the $400 million dollar Neves Corvo copper-tin mine where he met David and Cliff, and then after as senior consulting metallurgist on a variety of RTZ European projects. Of course that gives Ken tremendous knowledge and experience in dealing with Europe and as Senior Vice-President of European Operations. I'd now like to turn it over to David Murray to take you through a presentation and then at the end, of course, we'll take questions. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you John. I look forward to meeting with some of you over the next few days and few months. The presentation that we have organized today starts with some overall comments from me, some comments of my ideas on operating and project philosophies, and then I will review South American operating investments. Cliff Davis will then talk in terms of North American operations and projects, and as John has said that includes our project in Russia. Albrecht Schneider will specifically talk about the Skouries drill results announced last night. Ken Sangster will then talk in terms of the European projects that we have under development. And Eike Batista will then summarize for you. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The new operating team came in to place effectively in the third quarter of this year. Subsequent to that, between us, we have reviewed and visited all TVX operations and projects and our initial assessment in simple terms is as follows: firstly TVX has strong skills in securing deals; secondly, we believe that the operating structures and procedures need improvement; thirdly, the South American operating investments are solid; fourthly, as a general comment, the North American operating investments are under-developed, however, the North American projects are promising; and lastly, the European projects have a very strong resource base which you will see are certainly strong enough to more than double TVX output over the next five years. The generalized comments that I have in terms of operating and project philosophies are very simple. First of all, our structures need to be defined better than they are today - responsibility, accountability, and authority. We need improved procedures in terms of how we look at new investments of capital expenditure, we need a more rational view in terms of personnel, and we need to improve our purchasing procedures. In my experience, and coming from a relatively developed company like RTZ, I am a very strong believer in operating management with a key executive led by a general manager of the mine. The head office role is to support the general manager with as few staff as possible. In so far as running projects are concerned, again one needs simple structures. It is extremely important that the owner maintains control of the flash heat permanently. However, I also believe that the owner should supervise an EPC or EPCM contractor and I do not believe in TVX running a project organization of its own. Those are very simple directives. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Turning now to our operating investments in South America. The three investments have two common features. First of all they all have reserves in excess of ten years. Secondly, each of the three are managed by reputable companies. Turning to La Coipa, owned 50 percent by Placer Dome and 50 percent by TVX, we shall in the future be faced with declining gold grades. However, this is offset by the fact that La Coipa is now debt free and of course La Coipa has the Chimberos silver deposit which will be of high significance over the next three to four years and which you may well be aware of, we are doing feasibility studies on at the present time. Turning now to Brazil. The Crixas mine is 50 percent owned by Anglo-American and 50 percent by TVX. It has been and will continue to be a reliable and consistent producer. There is expansion potential available and that is under discussion with our partners at the present time. We also have the Brasilia mine, 51 percent owned by RTZ and 33 percent by TVX, again, a reliable consistent producer. It is currently under expansion to 18 million tonnes a year and that is scheduled to come into production by the fourth quarter of 1997 or maybe even a little bit earlier. I am quite satisfied that that expansion will occur on time. The attributable production in 1996, estimated in terms of our share of South American production, is approximately 320,000 to 325,000 ounces at a cash cost around something in the order of $190.00. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a solid operating base. I now turn you to Cliff Davis who will talk about our North American operations and projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DAVIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Thank you David. Good morning. I'll start with the operation which is my primary concern at the moment, that's Casa Berardi. Casa Berardi in Quebec is an underground gold operation.  We have made some progress there this year. Operating costs are reducing significantly compared with where they started at the beginning of the year. However, we have continuing problems in terms of production of gold. It's very variable, varies month by month from satisfactory to unsatisfactory largely as a result of inflexibility because of inadequately developed reserves. The future production of Casa Berardi depends very much on the development of the Principale Zone and between the East and the West mines which is where production is coming from at present.  We've been looking at the development of the Principale and it is apparent that we cannot bring that into production for between one to one and a half years from now. This leaves us with a number of alternatives for Casa Berardi and we are looking at all of those alternatives, we're discussing them with our partners.  The key alternatives under consideration at the moment are to continue the operation at a reduced throughput mining only the remnant ore reserves of the East and the West mine. The second alternative is to continue doing that and at the same time develop in the next year to year and a half the Principale Zone and then bring production up based on those reserves. A third alternative being considered is to close the operation down and thoroughly explore the total land package which is a very large land package. And our last alternative is to sell the operation. We are considering all those alternatives. We are discussing them with our partner and we expect to have a decision by the end of this year. Our next operation is the New Britannia underground mine in Snow Lake Manitoba. Considerable progress has been made there this year. We expect to produce 70,000 ounces in 1996 at a cash cost of $310.00 an ounce. For 1997 we're increasing throughput to obtain 85,000 ounces at a cash cost of $275.00 an ounce.  Production is steadily improving. Costs are steadily decreasing. And the cost next year will be achieved in spite of the fact that we are going to continue a very high rate of development and a very high rate of underground diamond drilling, both definition drilling and exploration drilling with the aim of increasing the developed reserves until we get to the point where we have at least one year of developed reserves ahead of us. Musselwhite, a project in Ontario which is operated by Placer Dome, is scheduled for an April start up.  Musselwhite is approximately one month to six weeks ahead of schedule at present. It is on budget currently and is estimated to be about five million US under a budget of $170 million total. The TVX share of that is $54 million. Annualized production is 200,000 ounces a year with TVX share of 64,000 ounces. Next year we're showing a total production of 144,000 ounces commencing in the beginning of April. The estimated '97 cash cost is $230.00 an ounce. In Russia we have a project which is an advanced stage project, the Asacha project in Kamchatka. Asacha is currently in the middle of a feasibility study being carried on by Davy International here in Toronto. It's a high grade underground deposit, 15 grams a tonne. We believe it has a lot of potential. We expect to have the feasibility study done by the middle of next year. At the same time we should have Russian mine permits in place and we should be in a position to make a product decision at that time. The current activity there is completion of a surface diamond drilling program to firm up reserves and add additional reserves and obviously the feasibility study which I mentioned at the start. And that is a quick summary of North American activities. And on to Albrecht Schneider Exploration Vice-President.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		At Skouries, which has been one of the main attractions of TVX's Kassandra assets, the company has started a comprehensive drilling program in August which will lead up to December of this year. Skouries is a classic copper-gold porphyry about ten kilometres inland from the Aegean. Company objectives for this year was to drill about 15,000 metres to a maximum depth of 1,000 metres to assess previous information which is composed of 16,000 metres of drilling and 600 metres of underground development by Nippon mining in 1962, Placer  Development in 1967, and Kassandra Mines in 1975. The objectives were also to revise ore reserve estimations made by Billiton circa 1980s. Billiton concluded that Skouries has an initial reserve of 72 million tonnes at .45 percent copper and .7 grams per tonne gold. TVX objectives were further to explore deeper into the deposit to establish the size of the gold and copper grade information, establish total resource estimates for gold and copper mining conditions and to initiate metallurgical test work for copper and gold. The current status of the project is as follows. Twelve holes were drilled in the central part of the area. Nine holes were drilled in the southern extension. We will have all 22 holes completed by December 15th. At present we have 4,098 metres analyzed which are the seven holes and the two partial holes given to you with the press release. The preliminary metallurgical test work is completed.  We can summarize so far we already had a classic porphyry copper. The volume of known potential ore mineralization extends vertically to 750m. At surface 300 by 250 metres. The opening widens over 500, 400 metres. The full extent of deep level mineralization for both laterally and horizontally are still unknown. The ore is two kinds of ore consisting basically of chalcopyrite-burnite gold with high levels of magnitite. There's also the presence of a shallow copper oxide zone at surface. High copper and gold grades than previously reported were achieved due to the change in drilling methodology and our analytical quality. We have highly consistent gold rates and copper rates over very large intervals. The mean copper rate gold data is 0.64 percent copper and for gold 1.17 grams per tonne gold.  Average grades at .25 percent copper and .25 grams of gold give a grade of .75 percent of copper and 1.36 grams of gold, which we reduce the current data base by 15 percent. The high grade ore near surface averages .8 percent copper and 1.5 grams of gold and the project shows a high grade gold zone at depth which is averaging around 1.1 percent copper and 2.2 grams of gold. Furthermore, we can conclude so far that there's large volume at grades of approximately .6 percent copper and 1 gram of gold with potential credits between 1 and 2.5 grams silver and .15 grams palladium.  Initial metallurgical results show a good copper concentrate of 30 percent with very good recovery in the order of 92 percent. Gold grade in the concentrate ranges from 1.5 to 3 ounces and it's recovery is 88 percent. In general there are very low impurities associated with this concentrate. I thank you very much.  Now Mr. Ken Sangster will continue to speak about our European projects.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good morning. I'd like to cover the areas in two parts. First of all Kassandra in Greece and then the Czech republic. First of all some highlights from the general situation with regards to Kassandra.  Activities during the year were divided into two main parts. Firstly, to put systems in place commensurate with developing large scale projects and secondly a continuation of our drilling program to further define the ore in situ.  In 1996, drilling done in the Stratoni Madem Lakkos Mavres Petres areas totalled some 15,000 metres and in Olympias 5,000 metres and I make special note of that because underground drilling has continued all year in Olympias and at Skouries, which Albrecht has just mentioned, some 15,000 metres. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>I would also like to highlight the issue that there is now a strong central government in place in Athens. There is generally a very positive attitude to investment. If I can now move down and subdivide the Greek operations. Kassandra mines, the Stratoni operations which involve the Stratoni mill and the Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres mines. During the year the Stratoni mill was refurbished and is now operating at a rate of 250,000 tonnes per annum treating mainly Madem Lakkos ore at grades of around 10 percent zinc, 8 percent lead and 200 grams per tonne silver. These operations at Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres, we believe, have about four to six years life on current mining reserves. But there are possible expansions including areas of high gold at the Madem Lakkos mines. As I mentioned earlier the Olympias infilled drilling continues to confirm ore resources and grade. We have also been working lately on some process enhancement. We believe the use of heavy media separation can remove up to 40 percent of the concentrate weight at zero gold loss. We're also looking at a biox and partial roast as a pre-treatment to autoclave which allows for a smaller autoclave and a smaller gold plant. And work should carry on in generally improving the environment which will include re-treatment of both the concentrate stock piles and of the original tailings. We're proceeding to work on a bankable document which will be ready by the end of 1997. A word or two about Skouries. Albrecht has already covered that in the geological sense. We believe the drilling will confirm a substantial resource. Processing seems to be relatively simple. The test work done to date yields clean copper  concentrate of about 30 percent copper and plus 50 grams per tonne of gold content. Over the next year engineering will be done to determine firstly mining methods, underground and open pit, and also scale of operations. We anticipate having a pre-feasibility study on Skouries completed by the end of 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>If I can move on to the Czech Republic, I will summarize the work done there this year. The drilling continues to confirm good grades of plus or minus 10 grams per tonne.  A good deal of process test work has been evolving over the year and we're now in a position to confirm the economic extraction can be accomplished without the mine site use of cyanide. This revised flow sheet should greatly assist permit application. In summary, what does all this mean. European drill indicated resource potential we believe is roughly the following.  At Kasperske Hory around about 3 million ounces.  At Olympias 5 and a half million ounces. Madem Lakkos/Mavres Petres 500,000 ounces. At Skouries 10 million ounces. All in all giving a total of European drill indicated resource potential of 19 million ounces. I'd like to pass on to our Chairman, Eike Batista.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Ladies and gentlemen good morning.  Let me try to summarize TVX's performance during '96.  I have six points. The first, in the beginning of the year I told most of you that my main objective was to find a senior Chief Operating Officer. We actually hired a team of three. I acknowledged the need to improve our technical team. We needed a projects and operational group capable of developing and operating properties to international standards. Finding this team was as difficult as finding a new mine. Their past performance and technical credibility speak for itself. I am convinced that TVX is finally in strong technical hands. Second, at the beginning of the year I also said that Kassandra would develop into a big gold camp, a new gold mining district in the world. The numbers are actually surpassing my own rosy glasses estimates. As you just heard, the reserves and resources will support a big, extremely low cash cost production in the near future transforming Kassandra into TVX's 100 percent owned flag ship, and supporting our goal of surpassing the one million ounce per year production by the turn of the century. Third, please do not forget that Kassandra is Europe, yes Europe. Not Kinshasa, Bangladesh or Jakarta. After landing in Frankfurt you take a two hour flight to Thessaloniki which is Greece's second largest city. An hour later, by car, you're at the mine site. Kassandra is already a running operation with in excess of 600 miners that are being retrained.  It will be producing an estimate of $25 million dollars in revenues for TVX in '97. The deal making negotiations team of TVX has handed the property to the operations team. From now on it is on standard procedural operational mode. Like any mine located anywhere in the world in a very, very civilized place. Greece, as you heard before, has a strong central government for the next four years that fully supports the project. I want to remind you that in the early days when I started with the company Chile had problems of perception, Brazil, the whole of the South American continent. It's time for people to understand that Kassandra is part of Europe and I'm convinced that the visit that we are scheduling for the property, actually scheduled for the 12th of January, will only confirm what I'm just saying. Fourth, something to think about.  How much is our 19 million ounces in resources in Europe worth, given that they are backed up by more than 140,000 metres of drilling and are extremely high grade. Low cost in production is assumable. If approximately $850 million dollars US was paid for Arequipa in Peru. Fifth, gold price. Well to hedge, TVX's hedge is really the fact that all of the new production is going to be extremely low cash cost. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>So TVX will have growth and TVX will have low cost. Six and last. Although we concentrated most of our efforts this year in developing existing assets which are big we haven't lost our deal making capabilities. We are as dynamic and alert as always and as you know we only bought and will buy value. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Ladies and gentlemen we'll now open up for questions and I believe you all know how this works and the operator will field the questions so, the first question please.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. We will poll for questions today using our quick cue polling feature. If you have a question please press star and one on your touchtone telephone. If you're using a speaker phone you may need to lift your handset first and then press star one. Should you wish to cancel your question please press star followed by the number sign but please do not hang up. We will poll for questions in the order of request. Please press star and one at this time if you have a question. The first question comes from Mark DeFranco from Pomboy Capital. Please go ahead sir.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi Eike the results look pretty robust to say the least. A question for you, if I try to put some numbers around Skouries, if based on your drill results you've got .75 percent copper 1.36 grams gold, if I use rock value of roughly $32.00 gross. Plugging that into a net smelter model given what Albrecht had said of how the concentrate looked and so forth you should net out of that $32.00 per tonne about $20.00 a tonne. If I subtract out a mining cost of call it $10.00 a tonne, pre-tax to you should be a margin of $10.00 per tonne. Now based on your potential there you're talking north of 200 million tonnes I would take it. I mean this right alone is worth more than your market cap.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. Absolutely. You're correct.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Are the numbers per tonne roughly feasible?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE> 		Ten dollars per tonne cost?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Net to you, right.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE> 		Ken please.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. Ten dollars, yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		So why are you still trading at $7.00 a share?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		I think actually we haven't really talked to the market since the beginning of the year and as I said before, I mean TVX concentrated in getting a technical team into the company and we're working hard. We drilled more than 50,000 metres in Europe and that's what, as I said before, it's substantiated this resource base with high grade and we're announcing it now. And I wanted, actually, the new technical team to revise our operations because I had doubts about our past technical team. So we needed to do that homework. Now we're ready and we're informing it to you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DeFRANCO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		The numbers look great. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. Our next question comes from Dalton Ferris from Carriage House Investors. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes, hello. I guess my comment is I'm just a private investor and what I continually see in the press is sort of some sort of negative news about TVX and you guys scurrying around sending out faxes trying to patch it up. So, I think that's what's causing the share value to be what it is. I think somehow you've got to get ahead of that.				</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			It's John Hick. Perhaps a comment on that. Particularly when you're dealing in foreign countries, and I'm thinking for example Greece and the Czech Republic where a lot of that negative publicity has come out, unfortunately we cannot control the local press. We spend a lot of time, effort and money dealing with public relations and informing the local people both at the government levels right down to the man at the street. But you're dealing with, in some cases, people that don't understand mining and unfortunately it's no different there than it is here. The bad news gets the press, the big negative stories about cyanide and pollution get the press and people don't want to hear too much about reality. We're working to change that. I think Greece is a good example of that. If you look at the general press reporting in Greece today I think you see some very good reporting. People now understand what we're doing. There's still going to be negative press. There's always going to be negative press. You can't please everybody. But I understand your concern. It's a concern that we're continually addressing as best we can. But we're confident we can do it right. We know we can. We say that. We're always prepared to talk to people about that but it takes time for them to understand.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Alvaro Cattao from AGX. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CATTAO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. My question is with the grade that you gave us on the press release, what are the approximate cash costs in dollars per ounce of gold considering the gold or the gold equivalent with copper?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This is David Murray here. I think you need to start off from the basis that Albrecht has already told us that the initial resource estimates will be available towards the end of January. I think it's extremely difficult for me to give you an answer to that question without a resource estimate and without conceptual engineering. And I really believe that your guess is as good as mine. But I must say I'm pretty positive about it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CATTAO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Don McLean from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good morning gentlemen. A couple of questions. Albrecht you went through on the Skouries, the copper recovery I missed. You said 88 percent on the gold.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Ninety-two percent Don. Ninety-two on the copper.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. And you had clean cons.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Any sense of what a strip ratio might be so we can start putting together our own estimates?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		I'll hand over this to Ken.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Between two and three.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		That was on the Skouries deposit. Thank you. Cliff on Casa Berardi you went through basically a full spectrum of different possibilities. Can you give us a sense as to the possibility of closure, what probability might you attach at this early stage of this evaluation to that possibility?	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DAVIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>			I wouldn't like to put a finger on it Don. It is one of the three or four alternatives we are strongly considering. The final decision is going to be made by the end of the year. Obviously in conjunction with our partners. And I wouldn't like to say anything more than that.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Then maybe I can ask the question a little bit differently. You were saying that the operating costs have dropped but you're still  having some, I guess, continuity problems in terms of the variability of production. Do you see that within the next year and a half that's going to be something that's just going to carry on and what kind of an operating cost would that translate through to in that timeframe?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DAVIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Yeah. That's the problem we've got. We have inflexibility of operation because we don't have enough developed stopes in the remnants of the East and West mine. That won't change until we've got some additional reserves developed. The best opportunity is probably the Principale Zone. That's a year and a half away so we're going to be left with the situation we've got now for at least a year and a half if we continue operations. Operating costs are currently in the mid to high $300.00 an ounce and we don't see that changing in the short term.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you. That helps, Cliff.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question is from Chris Bradbrook from Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRADBROOK:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yeah, good morning. Could you maybe give us some idea of what sort of production rate you anticipate at Skouries, and also the timing of potential production at both Skouries and Kassandra.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. This is David Murray again. I will repeat my caution that was given to you before. We need to complete the overall initial resource estimate in January. We need to do conceptual engineering in terms of mining methods. We need to do engineering in terms of scale and I really believe that it's far better that you look at the overall resource and then make your own conclusions. Our conclusions are obviously going to be positive but I would rather wait until we do some proper engineering on it. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRADBROOK:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. But no estimates on the timing?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		The timing, your guess is as good as mine. What we are looking for is a pre-feasibility during the course of next year. That will be followed by feasibility documents acceptable to banks and then construction. The construction period in terms of a plant operation like this is relatively simple.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRADBROOK:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Mark Burridge from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BURRIDGE:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good day gentlemen. Pleasure to meet your new team. I've got a question and I apologize if this has already been asked or answered because I wasn't on the call, and that is you talked a lot about your operations development. How about your exploration projects internationally? The one that springs to mind right now is Gurupi and I was wondering if you could give an overview of that and your exploration strategy over the next few years.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BATISTA:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Albrecht.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>	In Brazil at present we are running two major ventures. One is Gurupi as you just said together with Sante Fe our partner. Santa Fe is presently preparing pre-feasibility information which by April next year will put us in the position to review our strategy for the future on how we will proceed at Gurupi. Gurupi is a large low grade deposit within the Amazon region. We have a second project together with Battle Mountain called Volta Grande do Xingu on the Xingu River. It has currently the resource potential in the order of two million ounces and we are preparing for next year's drilling program to define this area further. This area is just one in a very large sector.  Apart from Brazil, we are currently very active in Ecuador in a joint venture with Newmont and Cogema in a very interesting epi-thermal low grade oxide gold deposit and we are also active in Nicaragua in a joint venture with our partner, Triton. In Nicaragua we are exploring a gold structure which was previously operated successfully by Noranda. We are very positive about the current results in Nicaragua. So basically our exploration strategy in this year and the future will be concentrating on our joint ventures and also evaluating constantly upcoming possibilities. We have also an exploration interest in our lease in Greece.  We also concentrate in Russia in additional areas around our current mine claims. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BURRIDGE:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. John Bridges from Flemings. Please go ahead sir.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi Eike. Congratulations on the progress. I just wondered perhaps one question on Skouries, the latest drill results, how do they compare with the work done by Billiton, better/worse...</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		The drill results done by Placer Dome and Nippon Mining were conducted in the early 60s in a period where gold was sitting around $50.00, the copper price was sitting around 35 cents.  The gold levels were established a different way. Another major difference is that the drilling was vertical and the deposit geography shows vertical structures so the drilling was basically down deep. We have changed this. We're drilling now two structures. This gives much better average information about deposits and both sectors are resulting in higher grades of gold and copper.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Great. You talk about a higher low grade zone and a deeper high grade zone. What's the cut-off? How deep do you have to go before you get into the better grade stuff?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		At Skouries the central part is mineralized throughout so there's no real low grade zone. The higher grade zone at surface indicates the possibility of a very effective open pit scenario where you have grades averaging 1.5 grams of gold and about 0.8 percent copper. This in the area of about 300 metres to about 500 metres. Here grades can go up in gold over 200 metres with 2.7 grams and 1.44 percent copper.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Great. And now perhaps La Coipa, the Chimberos silver rich project. Would that simply be replacement of other reserves or would you be perhaps increasing the scale of the operation down there?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		David Murray here. Those alternatives, in fact, are under discussion with Placer and I would assume that we will come to a conclusion on how to economically exploit it during the course of the next year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Paul Carmel from Bunting Warburg. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	
<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Good afternoon. David, you mentioned the possibility of declining grades at La Coipa. Could you give me an idea as to what these grades might be looking like in the next two to three years - gold head grades and silver head grades. A second quick question is on Casa Berardi. I'm just wondering about Principale. It seems to me there's been sort of an optimization program going on up there for a couple of years now. I'm just wondering why we're still sort of a year and a half away from accessing the Principale deposit. Cliff maybe you could touch on that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>DAVIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>			It's Cliff Davis. I'll answer that question first. The work that's been done wasn't solely to access Principale. It was a development program as it was called to link the East and the West mine at depth and put a shaft in at the east end of the mine. It was not only to provide bottom access to Principale but also to provide access for exploration throughout the strike length. It didn't, of itself, develop Principale. If you were doing it again, if I were to sit here now and say well would I do the Principale in conjunction with providing that access development I  would state that development itself should have been going on at the same time. The method chosen of development didn't really lend itself to doing that development concurrently so unfortunately we're left here now with while we have access at the bottom we don't have sufficient ore that's developed. That still has to be done.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This is David.  Back to La Coipa. The silver grades that we're looking at in terms of the current mines continue much the same at the moment. The gold grades probably will be dropping in the region of 15 percent or something like that. However, one needs to add on top of that in fact the potential extraction of Chimberos, which is, as I've said before, not yet determined.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Mr. Bill Otton from Beutel Goodman. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi. Albrecht, I know it's difficult to do over the phone but I'm just having trouble understanding the geometry and the high grade and lower grade zones of  the Skouries deposit. If I can read off numbers that as I understood initially, I understand that the surface expression of the outcrop is about 300 by 250 metres?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This information has been known by us from the previous owners and previous people who drilled there to a depth extend over 400 to approximately 550 to 600 metres. It has always been known that this is a rather vertical pipe. But in our drilling now we constantly record on the lateral wall rock zones and how they would compare with the pipe and what would really happened there. Drilling in outer zones we saw a continuation of mineralization in the wall rocks which could not really be associated easily with the centre of height. For that reason there is a strong indications now that there is a major source at depth which generated some other large mineralized zones which was later on dissected by secondary inclusion which is this pipe which re-enriched surface part of the deposit and enrich the centre core. We have also depleted core beyond the centre core.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. But just for the drilling that you've done, the area that you've investigated, the pipe area, would it be, is it fair to say that the sort of surface expression of that is about 300 by 250 metres?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		And then it continues down about 300, 400 metres deep?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		It continues to about 350 metres deep and then it opens up to the shape of a flask.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Right. Okay. And the aerial, if you took a slice at say 350 metres, a horizontal slice, that area might be 400 by 500 metres, something like that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This is what we're currently thinking of.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Right. And then the total vertical extent of that flask is at least 750 metres.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yeah. I think 750 metres is again the figure which we are dealing with at the moment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Does anybody there have any idea how deep you could go on an open pit with these kind of grades and this kind of structure, sort of a vertical structure like that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		It's Ken Sangster here. No, not really. As David said we're just embarking on pre-feasibility. We've got no geo-technical information as such. During the course of the pre-feasibility study, that will be one of the things that we need to look at, both in the extraction method and scales. As to the best possible depth for open pit I couldn't really answer that at the moment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thanks very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Barry Allan from Gordon Capital. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ALLEN:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Good afternoon gentlemen. I apologize if I missed it, but could you just sort of flesh out where the construction of the autoclave at Kassandra lies and what the time table is for completion there?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. Ken Sangster here again. The situation is at the moment that we're now doing surface drilling. We've been doing underground drilling all year to try and get about 70 percent of the reserve into proven and probable category. We're also using that program to gather samples and prove our process flow sheet. There has been considerable work done on designing an autoclave and we feel very happy that all of the parameters have been covered. The area we're looking at at the moment actually is trying to do some pre-treatment before the autoclave, trying to get more work done on the concentrator so that we get a more selective number for the autoclave to reduce its size and adjust the oxygen demand, etcetera. All of this, again, will come out during this year when we produce a bankable document.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ALLEN:<BLOCKQUOTE>			And how long would the construction period be potentially after the bankable document?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		We're looking at 24 months at present.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ALLEN:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Okay. And just briefly, Pachicutza, what's the status of that project now?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Pachicutza, we have had a feasibility study done on Pachicutza. It could become a 45,000 ounce producer at a cash cost of $190.00, but in the context of our operations it's probably a property that we will dispose of.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ALLEN:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Alright. Thank you gentlemen.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. At this time I would like to remind everyone if you do have a further question please press star and one on your touchtone telephone at this time. We do have a further question from John Bridges from Flemings. Please go ahead sir.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		In order to get some sort of strip ratio if you could give me some indication as to what sort of slope angle the rocks around the Skouries deposit would take?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		As I say we've really very little new technical information. There's a surface expression there obviously and there's a tunnel that was done by Placer and Nippon. The rock quality looks reasonably high. But slope angle will not be defined until we get engineering work completed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. I just wanted to know sort of order of magnitude. That's all, that's fine. On the concentrate, you were saying it's generally good. Any impurities at all, anything that's going to affect the price a smelter would pay?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		No. On the tests that we've done at the moment it's extremely low levels of impurities. It was very clean. I mean on the metallurgy we've done minerals are not present so you wouldn't expect them in the concentrate.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. You said something about palladium in the ore?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. We reviewed scientific literature on and determined that Skouries has been known to be a platinum minerals carrier and basically there's a very low level but it's an interesting scientific peculiarity in the ore.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Would that be recoverable?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		It would be recoverable but I doubt it will be sufficient to reach payable levels.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BRIDGES:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. We have a further question from Bill Otton from Beutel Goodman. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi. Just quickly on Kasperske Hory. Can you give us an idea as to the timing for production and the production rate and what sort of processing method you're going to be using if you're not using any cyanide.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. The drill program at Kasperske Hory which is ongoing is concentrating on the western extension. On the samples that we've dealt with so far which are in the central zone, the technology we're looking at is really rather simple. It's a mixture of gravity and flotation. The gold tends to be either relatively free and quite course or relatively fine but lots of sulphide, a combination of both methods gives good recovery in the order of 90 percent and a concentrate around about ten ounces per tonne. And in terms of time scale, if you were to build that sort of operation it's obviously a simple construction program than if you were building a full scale gold extraction plant. You'd be looking at about an 18 month construction period.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		And when would you expect that to be in production?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		We're in the process of starting a pre-feasibility study now. We then have to take that on with all the extra drilling to a full feasibility study. I would think that you're looking at about a two year program in that and then of course you have to get all the permits and approvals. So you're looking at about a two year program to a bankable document situation.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. And would you have anything in mind as far as production rate goes given a three million ounce resource right now?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Well it depends very much on the geometry. I mean until we do the drilling and get the geometry of that ore body, the constraint is probably a mining and available space problem. But a rough idea would be half a million tonnes a year.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. And where would you be processing the concentrate?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		I'm not sure at the moment and until we get enough test work done to get a firm handle on how that concentrate would behave and sort of variable it it's likely to be in a mixture of probably leeching it could be even smelting in which case you could sell it to a major smelting organization.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OTTON:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Right. Okay, thanks very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. And the next question come from Mr. Robert Rossetti from Dean Witter. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ROSSETTI:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi. Are you, do you have any plans for further write-offs for the Mineral Hill property and are there any write-offs planned for Casa Berardi?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>BERTO:<BLOCKQUOTE>			This is Rogerio Berto here. As Cliff said we're still studying the Casa Berardi situation. We will review the final documentation when it is presented by the technical people and assess the best alternative.  With regards to Mineral Hill, it was written off in the third quarter.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ROSSETTI:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from David Mallalieu from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Hi. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could tell me what you're looking forward to if the Principale Zone goes ahead for future capital costs on that project and could you give a brief description of what you are actually looking for with regards to potential reserves at La India?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Principale would appear to require in the order of, depending on the method of development of Principale, somewhere in the order of $20 million to $25 million Canadian to develop the reserve for mining.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		And would there be a, would you have in mind a specific production rate associated with that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MURRAY:<BLOCKQUOTE>		We think the Principale Zone can probably provide about 1,000 tonnes a day, about 60 percent of the mill feed.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		In La India the current resource potential was set by Russian development agencies. They calculated 2.4 million ounces. Our initial reviews demonstrate there should be at least a possibility to convert more than 50 percent of this number into initial reserves.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		And what is your program now for actually translating that into the mineable category?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		At the moment we are drilling to define this resource and we are planning to increase our drilling rate until the end of April or beginning of May in order to have a full picture of the resource estimates for late 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		That would be considered an underground mine?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		This would of course be an underground mine, yes.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>MALLALIEU:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. The next question comes from Don McLean from Nesbitt Burns. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Just a couple more questions. Looking at the Kassandra processing plant what would be your sense of how the operating costs could go compared to what was used in the initial numbers that were given to us Ken? Do you feel that the initial numbers are still numbers we should be working with or should we be thinking of capital operating costs higher or lower? That was one question.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Okay. I think if we are successful and we've already got to the pilot stage on heavy media separation, you're looking at 40 percent of the feed weight being rejected. So this obviously means that your concentrator will be smaller, sort of for the run of mine tonnage and we're also looking at ways of enhancing the grade of gold into the concentrate feed or the residue feed in this case with all the weight being taken out at the feed end to the gold extraction unit. So, yes, you are looking at somewhat lower capital costs and we believe with high grade feed lower operating costs can be achieved.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Right. Okay. One other thing. Ken if you could just re-run through the breakdown of your 19 million ounce European resource again just to make sure I've got the right numbers.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Yes. At Kasperske Hory we have a drill indicated potential of about three million ounces. Olympias is five and a half million ounces. Madem Lakkos Mavres Petres point five or five-hundred thousand, and Skouries at ten million ounces. Now we've done the Skouries drill indicated resource calculation based on current information using copper equivalents but using 65 cents per pound of contained copper. In other words counting the NSR.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		If you broke it into the gold only part of the ten million ounces what would that be Ken?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SANGSTER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		About seven and a half million ounces.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Great. The book value for Casa Berardi Rogerio can you give me that too, please?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>ROGERIO:<BLOCKQUOTE>		The book value as of September '96 is about $55 million US in our books.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>McLEAN:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. Thanks gentlemen.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>	Thank you.  The next question comes from Paul Carmel from Bunting Warburg.  Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>PAUL:<BLOCKQUOTE>		I read somewhere that there's a state archeological institute in Greece that has to sign off on any development decision on Kassandra? Is there any truth to that and if there is does it concern you and how does it sort of play in with your program there?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Paul it's John Hick. First of all in Greece the study of antiquities is extremely important and the Ministry of Culture is in charge of looking at antiquities in Greece. Every time you do something in Greece they are involved. They are involved in the following way. If antiquities are known to be in an area then they get involved in the project. If antiquities are discovered then they are entitled to be notified and to look at it. They then examine the antiquities and the level of examination depends on the facts and then they make a determination one of two ways. They either decide that although there may be antiquities relative to whatever that particular project might be it's not, if you will, important enough to override the project. If they feel that the antiquities are important enough then they can be involved and you may have to make alterations in your project to allow for those antiquities to be looked at from an archeology extent. That's the law of Greece. It's there. It's always been there and we will comply with it. On the Kassandra claims, if you will, or concessions, back in the '70's I guess, when they looked at putting an autoclave in before, this was by the Greeks, they had the Ministry look at the claims and they made a determination at that time that there was nothing of significant importance from an archeological point of view. So that's the current situation. They will look at things and if things are found then we'll deal with that on a case by case basis. But no, it's not something that is of great concern to us. It's the normal procedures.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>			I guess maybe worst case scenario your plant gets delayed. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			No. I don't see that it delays anything, Paul, because there is an existing plant there. There's an existing mine and an existing mill. The way the law works, they're not going to come in and say we think we've now got to take that back because we now decide something is there. The issue that it relates to is where do you place the new gold plants. And we have a study going on right now looking at at least, I believe, half a dozen locations for the gold plants. One of the factors that you will look at is whether there is any possibility of the archeological issues taking place. So I don't think it will delay anything. It's just part of the study for the appropriate plants.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Olympias is an underground operation.  Now Skouries is going to be a big pit. What's been done on that in terms of sort of condemnation work?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Well again, very little has been done but the whole Kassandra area has been deemed not to be of significance and we're not aware of any, if you will, historical work that shows any possibility there. But the same thing applies. But we don't see it as an area of concern.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>CARMEL:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Okay.  Thanks John.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. At this time we only have time for one more question. And we have a further question from Dalton Ferris from Carriage House Investors. Please go ahead.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		What do you expect your gold and gold equivalent production to be in ounces in 1997?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Our projection for 1997 production will be in the range of 400,000 ounces.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Is that a lot lower than it was several months ago? Is it a rolling forecast?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>SCHNEIDER:<BLOCKQUOTE>		We estimated for 1996 420,000 ounces and we're going to be in the range of 400,000 in 1997 so there's no big change. The total production is basically the same.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>FERRIS:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>OPERATOR:<BLOCKQUOTE>		Thank you. And at this time I would like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. John Hick. Please go ahead sir.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>HICK:<BLOCKQUOTE>			Thank you. With the end of the questions we'll now close off. We thank you all for participating. We look forward to seeing some of you in person in Toronto this afternoon and New York tomorrow afternoon. Thank you very much.</BLOCKQUOTE>
