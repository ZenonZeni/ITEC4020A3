PENTAGON APPROVES TACTICAL UAV DEMONSTRATOR

     The Pentagon has decided to rapidly introduce a close-range
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to the military services by pursuing
development and production through an advanced concept technology
demonstration (ACTD), DoD said Dec. 22.
     Pentagon acquisition chief Paul Kaminski formally approved the
concept in a Dec. 21 memo that calls for the demonstration of a
tactical UAV system within 18 months, as well as a pre-planned product
improvement (P3I) to build upon air vehicle capabilities. 
     Kaminski's approval came on the heels of an agreement brokered by
the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in mid-December between the
Army and Navy over divergent system requirements.The original
suggestion to scrap the traditional acquisition process in lieu of an
accelerated plan came last July after a year-long delay in releasing a
request for proposals (RFP).
     Formerly known as the Maneuver variant, the Tactical UAV (TUAV)
ACTD will include the procurement of six complete systems, two Mobile
Maintenance Facilities (MMFs), and eight attrition air vehicles and
Modular Mission Payloads (MMPs), according to Kaminski's memo.
     Moreover, the TUAV "should have a maximum projected cost of
$350,000 for the 33rd air vehicle and sensor," Kaminski stipulates.
"The TUAV selected for award should also have a maximum projected cost
of $300,000 for the 100th air vehicle and sensor." 
     The system is envisioned to have a range of 200 kilometers, be
able to fly for three to four hours, and be launched from land or sea.
     Officials in the Navy-led UAV Joint Program Office are anxious to
release a draft RFP for the TUAV ACTD as early as next week. A final
RFP is expected by the end of the month. Proposals are due around
March 11 and a final contract award should be made on "reasonably
quick order," JPO spokesman Ray Colemon said earlier this month.
     But the final RFP, and subsequent contract award, may not come so
soon, despite the level of importance the Army and Navy have ascribed
to the tactical UAV mission, military and industry officials contend. 
     For example, Kaminski has directed several things be completed
first to ensure a successful ACTD is pursued. The TUAV program manager
has been directed to develop an ACTD management plan which will
include TUAV life cycle costs, logistics support, manpower, training,
and transition to production. The program manager has yet to be
selected, Colemon said.
     The question of how best to transition from an ACTD to full
production--if such a decision is made--has plagued ACTDs in the past
and in this case has been a concern of Kaminski's. 
     Pentagon officials are grappling with the production issue with
another UAV program that was developed and built as an ACTD, the Tier
II Predator. The Predator ACTD, which ends in June, has been hailed as
a success for its quick development and its deployment last year in
support of NATO forces in Bosnia.
     An Integrated Product Team, which will evaluate the TUAV's
military utility, supportability, and producibility, is also being
established under Kaminski's orders.
     And lastly, the director of the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance
Office has been tasked to "develop a ground reception, processing, and
control system architecture and a schedule for achieving
interoperability with other UAVs, collection systems, and command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance systems," Kaminski's memo states.  One industry
official also foresees industry competitors having difficulty meeting
the requirements of the forthcoming RFP quickly. He points out that
the ACTD requirements are significantly different than the original
Maneuver UAV program. In particular, the range now called for is
almost four times greater 
than in the original program, which called for between 30 and 50
kilometers.
"[Industry] can't add weight or fuel [to go that distance] without re-
engineering the whole thing," the industry official said. 
     According to military and industry UAV officials, the potential
competitors for the TUAV ACTD contract include Westinghouse, Textron,
Alliant Techsystems, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon , a Boeing-General
Atomics team, and interested Canadian and German firms. 
     Kaminski is expected to decide soon on the fate of another UAV
program, the Hunter short-range UAV. The Joint Staff recommended
terminating the TRW -developed system late last year after numerous
air vehicle crashes and programmatic blunders. 
     According to officials familiar with the discussions, some of the
seven Hunter systems resulting from the existing production contract,
including 56 air vehicles, will divvied up among operational Army
units--and perhaps even the Marine Corps--over the next few months.
But no additional vehicles will be built.
     Some of the vehicles are likely to be put in storage, as the
Joint Staff recommended, an Army official said.

STUDY SEES 50 PERCENT GROWTH IN U.S. EW MARKET BY 2001

     The U.S. electronic warfare (EW) market projects U.S. sales will
grow from $1 billion last year to $1.45 billion by 2001, according to
a new study by the market research firm Frost & Sullivan.
     The study says the market will decline slightly to $946 million
in 1997  but rebound later in the decade when programs completing
development move into production.
     F&S says in U.S. Electronic Warfare Market that rotary-wing
aircraft equipment will rise from 13 percent of total EW market
revenues in 1995 to 20 percent in 2001 while the market for
fighter/attack aircraft equipment will dip from 72 to 61 percent in
the same period.
     The study says the EW market has shifted from single-service
sales toward greater coordination between the services and adds that
DoD is encouraging U.S. suppliers to reach overseas for technology
partners to lower development costs and enhanced interoperability in
systems.

V-22 EMD EFFORT ON COURSE FOR DECEMBER FIRST FLIGHT

     Current projections--backed up by actual parts flowing from
pre-production processes--show that the V-22 Osprey is now weighing
nearly 1,300 pounds under the empty weight figures specified in the
contract between the U.S. Navy and Bell Boeing, a 1995 year-end check
on progress shows. 
     "We have about 50 percent of the aircraft which is now 'actual'
parts with known weights," says Stuart Dodge, Director of the Joint
Program Office (JPO) in Washington, D.C. "They all conformed to our
predictions. It shows we have the weight projections nailed down."
     Dodge recently told JPO employees in a Christmas letter that the
weight savings have exceeded--by more than a factor of two--the target
weights set by the Bell Boeing manufacturing team themselves.
     "It's directly related to the advanced production processes in
use. Put simply, they minimize errors and guarantee first time
results," Dodge said in a follow-up interview with sister publication
Helicopter News.
     Dodge--who credits pioneering work done with the Boeing 777
airliner with the production process success--says the first EMD
(Engineering, Manufacturing and Development) Osprey fuselage was
recently mated to its wing structure "with the tap of a rubber
mallet."
     This operation--which brought the Boeing Helicopters Div.,
fuselage together with wings manufactured by Bell Helicopter Textron
in Arlington, Texas,--represented an important milestone for the
project.
     "It qualified us to begin giving out advanced long-lead contracts
to vendors for the first Osprey production equipment items," he said.
     Go-ahead for the first, or low rate initial production (LRIP),
parts will follow the first flight of this aircraft set for December
of this year. It will be the seventh V-22, but the first built to
production-level specifications.
     "Everything hangs on meeting that [first flight] commitment,"
Dodge said.
     The stakes are high. With this flight complete, the government
will formally begin the process of buying 523 V-22s it has contracted
for (425 for the Marine Corps, 48 for the Navy and 50 for the Special
Operations Command.) 
     Costs of the program show a similar story to the one on weight,
he said, with the first EMD aircraft now exhibiting a "recurring
flyaway" cost estimate of $32.5-million per aircraft. Dodge said this
is on track to meeting its the target price goal of $29.4-million (in
FY '94 dollars.) A cost reduction program under assessment has the
potential of reducing this to $28.1 million.

ARPA EMBARKS ON ELECTRIC COMBAT VEHICLE DEMONSTRATION

     The Advanced Research Projects Agency is soliciting proposals for
electric power systems for future use in land combat vehicles,
according to an announcement in Commerce Business Daily.
     As part of ARPA's Integrated Product and Process Development
effort, the agency plans to demonstrate the ability of electrically
engineered land vehicles to provide ground forces with increased
mobility, lethality, deployability, command and control, and
survivability, according to the Jan. 4 announcement. Proposals are due
by Feb. 21, 1996. [SOL BAA96-09, POC John Gully, 703/696-8401]

PENTAGON RESTORES MOST OF ARMY's MONEY FOR RADIO PROGRAM 

     The Pentagon's civilian leadership last week heeded the Army's
cries over the past few months and agreed to restore nearly all of the
service's funding request for the Single Channel Ground and Airborne
Radio System (SINCGARS) in the next two fiscal years, according to DoD
officials and budget documents.
     The service is now set to accelerate fielding of an improved
version of the primary tactical radio system and believes it can
retain two prime contractors and continue to keep costs down. General
Dynamics and ITT  compete annually for SINCGARS production and are
both working on the SINCGARS System Improvement Program (SIP).
     In early December, Deputy Defense Secretary John White restored
the $92.8 million in FY '97 money DoD Comptroller John Hamre
recommended be cut last November. However, until last week, the Army
was set to lose all of its $298 million request for FY '98.
     In program budget decision (PBD) 731 on Dec. 28, White restored
$267.9 million in FY '98, $30 million less than the Army was looking
for. The decision came after continued Army assertions that the FY '98
cut would put the program and force readiness in jeopardy.
     Although the Army won't be able to buy as many radios in FY '98
as originally intended, service officials are confident the program is
out of the woods.
     "We see that as a pretty fair cut," an Army budget official said
of the $30 million FY '98 decrement. "We made our case and got most of
what we asked for." 
     Budget requests are made for two fiscal years at once, but
Congress appropriates funding for only one year at a time. This year
the Pentagon is at a disadvantage going into its final budget
deliberations because without a federal budget for FY '96 it lacks a
funding baseline for FY '97 to work against. Without a federal budget
soon, the FY '97 request will likely be delayed beyond the statutory
deadline for being submitted to Congress. 
     The comptroller's original recommendation to cut FY '97 and FY
'98 SINCGARS money was based on the belief that the Army planned to
use the resources to outfit the National Guard with the primary
command and control system used by infantry, armor, artillery and
aviation units. But, the argument went, the National Guard has no
warfighting mission, does not require SINCGARS, and should make do
with its older VRC-12 series radios.
      But the Army, in an appeal to Hamre's recommendations in
November, said it plans to field the SINCGARS SIP radio to first-to-
fight units and that the National Guard will benefit only by receiving
those SINCGARS already fielded and set to be replaced by the SIP
radios. The appeal by Neil Ginnetti, principal deputy assistant
secretary of the Army, prompted White to approve the FY '97 request in
December. But the Army's continued fight led to White's decision last
week to approve FY '98 funding as well.
     Last fall the Army decided to accelerate the SINCGARS program in
an effort to field the required 225,000 radios as quickly as possible
and save nearly $500 million over the future years defense plan by
buying out the program in three years instead of eight. The Army plans
to apply those cost savings to other areas. The accelerated plan
called for $283 million in FY '97, $298 million in FY '98, and $15
million in FY '99 and FY '00, according to internal Army documents.

ARMY TO BRIEF INDUSTRY ON SCOUT SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM

     The Army plans to host an industry briefing this month on the
service's plans for the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System
(LRAS3), the Communications Electronics Command, C4I Electronic
Warfare Acquisition Center, says in the Jan. 3 Commerce Business
Daily.
     The Army expects engineering and manufacturing development (EMD)
of LRAS3 to begin in FY '96/97 with production of 650 systems
beginning in FY '99.
     The Army may award up to two study contracts for the program or
decide to go directly into an EMD contract.
     LRAS3 is a long-range, line-of-sight system that will be used by
Army maneuver battalion scouts in both mounted and manportable mode
for reconnaissance of terrain and tactical surveillance. The system
will have near all-weather capability for target acquisition with
integrated 2nd Generation Forward Looking Infrared, low-light level
TV, eye-safe laser range finder, digital compass, and global
positioning system. The system will have the capability to digitize
and provide imagery/information transmitted over Army standard
tactical communications networks. [Contact: Stephanie Allen, 908/532-

BDM WINS ARMY SUPPORT CONTRACT FOR BOSNIA

     BDM Federal said last week it won an $11.7 million contract from
the Army to provide about 500 interpreters and translators to assist
American military personnel in Bosnia and Hungary as part of Operation
Joint Endeavor.
     "U.S. forces must be able to communicate quickly and directly
with the people of Bosnia and Hungary if Operation Joint Endeavor is
to succeed," Phil Odeen, BDM chairman and CEO, said.
     The company is currently recruiting prospective interpreters and
translators who will be consultant-linguists of BDM while they are in
Bosnia and Hungary and will be paid a stipend for their services.
     BDM Federal is a subsidiary of BDM International, Inc..

JOINT STARS TO CONTINUE OPERATIONAL TESTING IN BOSNIA

     Operational testing of the Joint Surveillance Target and Attack
Radar System (Joint STARS) will continue while the aircraft system is
deployed operationally over Bosnia as part of Operation Joint
Endeavor, an Air Force official said in late December.
     Joint STARS, a system that consists of a modified Boeing E-8
aircraft and ground-based terminals, was sent to Iraq during the
Persian Gulf War. That deployment delayed the system's operational
testing. Air Force officials were concerned that a second deployment
would further delay the independent operational testing.    
     "[The Office of the Secretary of Defense] and the Air Force spent
time with the [Director of Operational Test and Evaluation], along
with Air Combat Command, to put together a deployment and multi-
development test and evaluation [schedule] that would be transparent
and non-interfering" with the ongoing Bosnian mission, Air Force Col.
Robert DeBusk, commander of the 4500th Joint STARS squadron
[provisional], said in a telephone interview. On Dec. 4, DOT&E signed
off on a plan to concurrently test Joint STARS during Operation Joint
Endeavor. DeBusk spoke to Defense Daily from Rheim Air Base, Germany,
regarding the fledgling U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
     "We need to do that to ensure full rate production in 1996,"
DeBusk said. He added that first and foremost, Joint STARS is to
provide surveillance for U.S. troops in the peacekeeping mission. But
when possible, the platform and its associated ground stations will be
tested. 
     The Joint STARS system will begin operations over and in Bosnia
in January, DeBusk said.
     Northrop Grumman, the Joint STARS aircraft system prime
contractor, is to deliver two Joint STARS systems to the Air Force in
FY '96. The Air Force has a requirement for 20 of the systems. The
service plans to buy the aircraft at a rate of two or three a year for
the next 10 years at a cost of about $5 billion to $7 billion.
     Joint STARS is a long-range, air-to-ground surveillance and
battle management system that can locate and track vehicle and armor
movements. The program, run jointly by the Army and the Air Force, is
comprised of an airborne platform, a radar sensor with subsystems and
a ground station that receives, in real time, the radar data processed
in the aircraft. Motorola builds the Ground Station Modules (GSM).
     Two E-8 Joint STARS aircraft left on Dec. 14 for Bosnia from
Northrop Grumman testing grounds in Melbourne, Fla. Along with the two
E-8s, at least 10 GSMs from Fort Bragg, N.C., and Fort Hood, Texas,
are being deployed to help monitor vehicle movements during the
transition between the United Nations' protection force in Bosnia and
the implementation of NATO forces there.
     In preparing for the January missions, DeBusk is running training
sorties of Joint STARS to check out the crews and to "determine the
ground truth." The Joint STARS, based out of Rheim, will be monitoring
"vehicle-type" movements, he added. 
     Joint STARS has not flown in an operation since Desert Storm. One
obvious difference between that mission and the upcoming one is that
Bosnia is a different terrain, full of mountains and trees, somewhat
limiting Joint STARS' ability to survey and track movements. 
     Overall, Joint STARS was considered a great success in Desert
Storm and DeBusk plans on using the lessons learned in that operation
in Bosnia. 
     "I have reviewed lessons learned and have set down with Lt. Gen.
George Muellner [principal deputy assistant secretary of the Air Force
for acquisition] to get his perspective on the lessons learned," he
said. "We are going to try to avoid any mistakes [made during Desert
Storm.]" Muellner commanded the Joint STARS squadron in Desert Storm.
     DeBusk added that the Joint STARS mission for Bosnia is different
than that in Desert Storm in that this time, it is completely a joint
operation. 
     "The 4500th is a unique organization because it is a totally
joint Air Force, Army group. The vice commander is Army Col. Randy
Young. Our organization is Army and Air Force top to bottom. It is a
success story from the joint perspective."

EMERGING COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS BEING CONSIDERED FOR BOSNIA  

     The results of a recent exercise that tested the ability of
emerging communications systems to work together in support of joint
military operations are affecting Pentagon discussions on how to best
equip U.S. and NATO forces in Bosnia, with several systems on the
table for probable deployment to the European theater in the coming
months, according to Pentagon officials.
     A "lessons learned" report on the Joint Warrior Interoperability
Demonstration (JWID), recently approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
recommends these systems be fielded at the earliest possible date,
following the determination by exercise evaluators that they greatly
enhance the capabilities of U.S. forces across a broad spectrum of
military operations.
      The high-level Military Communications and Electronics Board
will be briefed on these recommendations and Pentagon officials
believe many, if not all, will then be put into motion. 
     "A lot of the [communications] technologies to be used in Bosnia
resulted from the JWID proof of concept," Ronald Elliot, Marine Corps
assistant chief of staff for command, control, communications,
computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems integration, told Defense
Daily. 
     Elliot was tapped last year by the Joint Staff to supervise the
exercise, which is held every year and rotates the service sponsor.
     "Those kinds of things being used in the commercial sector and
civil agencies that can be applied to military operations emerged
[from JWID]," Elliot said. "All of those are being planned to be
applied" to current operations, most notably Bosnia.
     According to officials at the Defense Information Systems Agency,
the lead agency in formulating the insights gained from the exercise,
the lessons learned report will be widely distributed beginning the
second week of January. 
     Although the JWID report doesn't specifically mention Bosnia and
recommend the systems in question should be utilized there, "if you
read between the lines you can certainly pull that out of this," a
DISA official said. "It does certainly say these capabilities should
be made available immediately."
     The communications systems being considered for use in NATO's
Operation Joint Endeavor as a result of JWID '95 serve a broad range
of purposes, according to officials familiar with the findings.
     Communications on Operational Modeling, Planning, and Simulation
Strategy (COMPSS), a training tool largely aimed at improving the
execution of air mission plans and fostering a smoother, more
effective air tasking order process, is being "bannered around for
going [to Bosnia]," the DISA official said. "It did very well in
JWID." COMPSS is an effort originally led by the Advanced Research
Projects Agency and is now under the auspices of the Defense 

Modeling and Simulation Organization.

     Another capability successfully demonstrated and being considered
for a Bosnian deployment is the Collaborative Contingency Targeting
(CCT) system, officials said. An evolution of an older program known
as Rapid Application of Air Power, CCT was developed to "solve the
targeting problems" encountered by pilots during the Persian Gulf War
such as dated information on the location and purpose of Iraqi bombing
targets. That "did very well" during JWID as well.
     The exercise also convinced officials that large screen displays
and electronic "white boarding" capabilities would enhance operational
planning and execution in any hot spot. White boarding is nothing more
than electronic "chalkboards" that can be used in briefings throughout
an operation such as Joint Endeavor.    
     Many of the capabilities such as COMPSS and CCT have been pursued
by the Pentagon as advanced technology demonstrations, aimed at
introducing next-generation systems to the warfighters in a timely
fashion. C4I officials are now urging these capabilities be leveraged
in Bosnia. 
     Some of the communications capabilities proven during JWID, and
now being considered for Bosnia are nearing the completion of their
development anyway, officials contend. These include the Global
Command and Control System (GCCS), a contractor-supported DISA
integration effort to tie together the services' disparate command and
control systems into a global network. GCCS is currently being tested
and is set to replace the outdated World-Wide Command and Control
System early next year.
     The Global Broadcast System (GBS), or at least much of what it
will offer, is also a candidate for use by U.S. troops in Bosnia,
according to officials. A Navy program, GBS is scheduled to leverage
commercial satellites to offer the military direct voice, data, and
video broadcast capability virtually everywhere on the planet
beginning in FY '96.
     "The key is even though [GBS] has specific requirements as a new
[program], that capability can now be fielded in Bosnia," a Pentagon
official said. "The constellations and equipment are there."
     Likewise, asynchronous transfer mode communications--already
fielded to U.S. forces in the continental U.S. and Hawaii--are ready
for deployment, according to officials. This technology provides
secure telecommunications service via satellite.
     The Pentagon official noted that although contractors are
developing these emerging systems, C4I officials are recommending only
the capabilities be introduced to the force quickly. In other words,
"even though a specific system has been demonstrated, [the capability]
could be introduced another way."  
     As Pentagon leaders decide which communications capabilities
should go to Bosnia and how best to introduce them, the warfighting
community in Europe is playing a crucial role as it determines what it
needs. Requests from the warfighters are being funneled through Air
Force Brig. Gen. Buford "Randy" Witt, the European Command's director
of command, control, communications, and computer systems, in
Stuttgart, Germany. Witt's billet is a DISA one. 
     According to Maj. Charlie Roberts, Witt's executive officer,
"EUCOM's role is to validate and expedite requests for communications
to support the U.S. side and NATO in Operation Joint Endeavor. A 24-
hour a day operations center, manned by a Crisis Action Team, has been
set up to field those requests and then task the relevant component to
meet them.
