<P>
        <B>When her doctor said only chemotherapy and radiation would work against
her cancer, Cheryl Wilkens said "no thanks." Instead, she turned to the
nutritional therapy of Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, M.D., and has been cancer-free
ever since.
</B>

<P>
What prompts a person with cancer to say "no" to chemotherapy and radiation? As suspicions build today that scientists are misfiring in their battle with cancer, more people like myself are investigating other ways of treatment. One third of Americans are now choosing alternative care, and not just those needing cancer treatment. But if you want to know about cancer, I have a firsthand understanding on why this is so.
<P>
My own medical experiences opened my mind to alternative medicine. It all began in July 1991 when a tumor on my knee and three moles on my back were surgically removed. The surgeon told me the tumor was merely fatty tissue and the moles were benign. The following month the lump returned to the same place on my knee.  But all my surgeon said was this: "It's scar tissue, don't worry about it."
<P>
In December I was back in his office again because the lump had grown dramatically and it felt hot.  No longer thinking it was scar tissue, he operated at once. He told me it was a high grade malignancy, a kind of cancer called histiocytoma. He said he was sure he got it all with his scalpel. But the next day the lab said he had to cut out an even bigger chunk of my knee, which he did, leaving me with a 15 inch scar, somewhat disabled, and in constant discomfort.
<P>
Two weeks later I sat in the oncologist's office. He glanced through my medical file, then recommended the maximum treatment of chemotherapy and radiation over the next 6 months to kill any remaining cancer cells.  He said he wanted to check with other institutions over the weekend for a second opinion. But when I  saw him again the next week and asked him what he had learned, he said he had gone skiing instead. When I told him I'd be seeking a second opinion at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and with New York City physician Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez,  he abruptly stood up and walked out.
<P>
One of the first shocks I got at the Mayo Clinic was that while my surgeon had said there was no evidence of a malignant melanoma, the Mayo Clinic doctors indicated otherwise. After examining the pathology slides for my moles, they called it "a superficial spreading level 3 melanoma."  They also told me, for the first time, what the likely side-effects of chemotherapy for the "histiocytoma" might be, such as damage to my kidneys, heart, and gall bladder.
<P>
Back home again, my surgeon asked me to visit his office. He "warned" me that I had been the topic of conversation with 15 top cancer specialists and that none of them had heard of Dr. Gonzalez' metabolic-nutritional therapy. They all said I shouldn't waste my time on a New York City "quack."  The way the surgeon looked at me would have crushed the hopes of many patients, I'm sure; but when he saw I wasn't convinced, he looked uncomfortable, dropped his surly posture, and changed the subject.
<P>
He pulled out a report from the National Cancer Institute that said  basically there weren't grounds for believing chemotherapy would be effective for my histiocytoma. Yet here he was telling me I should go through with it because alternative treatments were useless.
<P>
Meanwhile, my knee wasn't working right because the surgeon had removed my patella tendon. Of course nobody told me about this until much later, when I discovered it by reading through my records. Now my knee wasn't strong enough even for me to walk upstairs.
<P>
I thought about things. I'm 43. There is cancer in my family. My father,
grandfather, and great grandfather all died of cancer. With that kind of
history, I thought maybe it's time to take a different approach to treatment.
When you are diagnosed with cancer, you are introduced to yourself. You find out
what you are made of.  And when you choose an alternative therapy, you find
yourself living in a glass house. People watch what you do-they watch
everything-and often with a skeptical eye.
<P>
In February of the next year, or 7 months after my first office visit for my knee problem,  I walked into the Park Avenue offices of Nicholas J. Gonzalez, M.D., in New York City for my first 2 hour appointment. I was reassured to learn that he tapes his office visits for future reference. I suppose I wasn't quite as desperate as many of his patients who come to him bearing prognoses of 2-3 months more to live, after having survived unsuccessful courses of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Still, the results from his analysis of my blood and hair weren't good news. I had a great deal of cancer in my body, most of it in my lymphatic system.
<P>
I saw Dr. Gonzalez again the next day for 2 hours when he laid out the details of his comprehensive program of metabolic therapy.  This is based on the 25 years of research by a dentist named Dr. William Donald Kelley who developed a program featuring nutrition, detoxification, and supplements as a way of treating many degenerative diseases, including cancer. Dr. Kelley described 10 categories of metabolic types. As he saw it, there are  10 different body styles of needing and assimilating foods.  Nutritional therapy should be based one's metabolic type, he said. Dr. Gonzalez spent 5 years studying cancer patients in Dr. Kelley's program to be sure it worked.
<P>
As I drove back home, I thought that maybe more doctors should ask patients about their bowel movements. All my life I have been constipated. If I went once a week, I considered that normal.  Now I see how abnormal and toxic that was, how it contributed to my illness. After all, if a body is smart enough to create a disease, then it makes sense that it must be smart enough to cure it, too.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>"Who do you think you are that you can drink some carrot juice, pop vitamins, do coffee enemas, and get well when there are sophisticated technologies for cancer?" Except they aren't winning the cancer war with these supposed marvels."
</CENTER></H3><HR WIDTH=90%>
<P>
Sometimes I had doubts about it all. I would say to myself: "Who do you think you are that you can drink some carrot juice, pop vitamins, do coffee enemas, and get well when there are sophisticated technologies for cancer?" Except they aren't winning the cancer war with these supposed marvels.  
<P>
My doubts usually came when I wasn't feeling well or was over-tired. My husband was a strong supporter. "It's a done deal," he'd say whenever he saw me in these funks. He meant that as far as he was concerned, this was the best  and only way to whip cancer. That made me able to trudge on.
<P>
How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. The same applies to completing a
comprehensive regimen like this one. Just hit away at it one day at a time until
it becomes second-nature to you-which took me about 3 years, by the way.
Anyway, the alternative to the alternative doesn't really work. 
<P>
Looking back at the last 40 years of cancer research, it seems like digging in your pocket for a coin that's not there. They've been looking in the wrong place.
Somewhere in my healing journey I took on the attitude of this Chinese proverb: "Man who says it will not work, shouldn't disturb man who's making it work." And I thought: until God opens another door, this alternative treatment is the best  for me.
<P>
Perhaps my greatest discouragement comes from the fact that a program like this that works, even though it costs less than chemotherapy, is not covered by insurance. I paid for this all out of my own pocket. The supplements ran me about $400 a month and my 2 sessions with Dr. Gonzalez cost $1800. It was a huge financial burden, yet it was a price I was willing to pay to get well. Of course it meant I had to keep my full-time job as church secretary during this period even though Dr. Gonzalez generally recommends you concentrate your time on healing.
<P>
Today, after 3 years on Dr. Gonzalez' program, I am nearly cancer-free. According to a standardized blood test used by conventional cancer doctors, I do not have any cancer. But according to the more refined test that Dr. Gonzalez uses, I still have some cancer activity. So I will always have to keep up a nutritional maintenance program.
<P>
        Am I lucky? Yes, I am lucky-lucky to have taken control of my own
health care. Lucky to have been introduced to this form of treatment. Lucky not
to have burned up my body with chemotherapy and radiation.
<P>
        Let me tell you something a little grim. In the 3 years I've been on this
program, I have known many people with cancer who chose chemotherapy and
radiation. They are now either dead or on yet another chemo series for a
relapse. Yes, I am lucky!-By Cheryl Wilkens

<B>EDITOR'S NOTE:  No physician can successfully treat or cure all cancers. Be cautious when you consider a practitioner for cancer treatment. On the other hand, the clinical work of Dr. Gonzalez has been so impressive that the National Institutes of Health is now backing further research into his approach. We hope that when the results are announced, they will be presented fairly and accurately and not distorted by the cancer establishment.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>Making Dr. Gonzalez' Program Work For Me</CENTER></H2>

I began to figure out how best I could make Dr. Gonzalez' program work for me. It called for a daily regimen of, literally, 150 vitamins, minerals, and enzymes, starting at 3:30 a.m. I had to do 4 coffee enemas a day, starting at 2 a.m., to help rid my system of the toxins being released as the tumor dissolved.  This was to especially help my liver and gall bladder, which would respond quickly to the caffeine and contract vigorously, releasing stored wastes.
<P>
About once a month I did a special bowel clean-out (Dr. Gonzalez calls it the "clean sweep") using psyllium seed husks and a bentonite liquid. This scrubbed out my colon.  Along with this I did a liver flush (using olive oil, apple juice, ortho-phosphoric acid, and other ingredients) to help purify my liver. Both of these procedures took about a week.
<P>
There were other practices I didn't have to do but that Dr. Gonzalez often
prescribes to cancer patients. There is a detoxification program Dr. Gonzalez
calls the &quot;purge.&quot; You drink a mixture of citrus fruit juices and
Epsom salts. This is to aid in the rapid removal of metabolic wastes from my
body.  Dr. Gonzalez also has patients do skin rubs, salt and soda baths, mustard
foot soaks, and castor oil compresses-and again, all of this is to draw
the toxins out of the body.
<P>
I had to start eating organically grown foods and whole grains  and only meats
produced without hormones or antibiotics. Raw vegetables and fresh fruits, fresh
juices, especially 8 ounces of carrot juice every day, and no canned, processed,
or deep-fried  foods-these were also part of my program.
<P>
I figure that by the end of my first year on the Gonzalez program I had consumed the juice from over 2000 pounds of carrots and an untold amount of apples. I avoided refined sugar out of consideration for my pancreas; I avoided aluminum cooking utensils, as well as aluminum-containing deodorants and lotions. White flour, soybean products, and peanuts also had no place in my diet as part of this program.
<P>
