<b>Volume 2 --Phase I Budget and Financial Information</b>  
<p>
  <dl>I.   Financial Information<p>
Discuss the financial resources available to the consortium for 
completion of the proposed
Phase I project.  References available through Dun & Bradstreet or 
similar sources should
also be provided.  Following selection, DOE may request financial data on 
the Applicant, its contractors, and any consortium member providing cost 
sharing.
<p>
The Applicant should submit a list of current or recent (within the past 
2 years) Federal
Government contracts, grants, or Cooperative Agreements (if any) which 
either it or
consortium members have entered into that are relevant to the proposed 
project.  Include the name of the Federal Agency, instrument number, 
dollar amount, subject area, and the name and telephone number of the 
Federal Contracting Officer.
<p>
In order to qualify for a financial assistance award, the Applicant must 
demonstrate a financial management system that complies with 10 CFR 
600.121 and/or describe the ability to comply with 10 CFR 600.121 
requirements.  A brief description of the proposed system must beincluded 
for DOE to evaluate.  The Applicant is encouraged to provide a recent 
Federal or independent audit of the Applicant's financial management 
system.  Additionally, the Applicant must provide the names, if known, of 
the Applicant's Cognizant Federal Agency (CFA, i.e., the Federal agency, 
such as DOE, that provides the majority of the Applicant's Federal 
funding), and Cognizant Delegation Office (CDO, i.e., office within the 
CFA, such as the DOE Golden Field Office, providing most of the CFA 
funding).
<p>
<b>II.  Project Cost Budget Summary</b>
<p>
Provide accurate, complete, and well-documented cost estimates for that 
portion of the
project which DOE is funding and all committed cost sharing.  The 
information should
support the data provided in Volume 1.  The estimated project costs 
should be presented in
sufficient detail to allow evaluation of each cost element of the 
project.  If cost escalation
factors are used in determining cost estimates, these should be clearly 
defined with
justification.  Cost data for the proposed project should be submitted on 
the Budget
Information Form (DOE F 4600.4) and supported by completing the Budget 
Explanation
Form (GO-PF20).  Additional guidance is provided with the Budget 
Explanation Form. 
Applicants should provide all of the information requested on the Budget 
Explanation Form, but may do so by attaching table or spreadsheet 
information and referencing the attachment under the applicable item on 
the Budget Explanation Form.  Fee or profit for the Applicant is 
prohibited in financial assistance and may not be included in the 
application.
<p>
On the Budget Information Form, budget numbers and supporting information 
for
Personnel, Fringe Benefits, Travel, Equipment, Supplies, and Indirect 
Charges should be
provided for all entities contributing to the project.  The total amount 
of costs other than
those of the Applicant should be provided under the category 
"Contractual".  The "Other"
category is for cost items which do not specifically fit into any of the 
other budget
categories.  Information contained under "Contractual" must be supported 
on separate
Budget Information and Budget Explanation forms.
<p>
Both the DOE funding and the Applicant's cost share must be supported on 
the
Budget Explanation Form.  It is understood that costs included in the 
application will be
estimated.  However, the support on the Budget Explanation form must be 
sufficient to
show the basis for the estimates.
<p>
<b>III. Cost Sharing</b>
<p>
Identify the sources and dollar amounts of cost sharing for the proposed 
Phase I project. <p>
Provide evidence of firm funding commitments.
<p>
Provide an itemized estimate of the monetary value (basis of and the 
nature, e.g.,
equipment, labor, facilities, etc.) of any and all non-cash contributions 
to the project.  For
the purpose of this solicitation, the "cost sharing" definition is 
contained in 10 CFR
600.30, 600.123, 600.224, and OMB Circular A-110.  Foregone fee or profit 
shall not be
considered cost sharing under any resulting agreement with the Applicant.  
Payment of
actual costs in the final agreement will only include those costs that 
are allowable and
allocable to the program as determined in accordance with the applicable 
cost principles
prescribed in 10 CFR 600.127 and the Cooperative Agreement language.
<p>
 <b> IV. Other Information</b>
<p>
Provide any other relevant information, such as required forms which were 
not included in
the above sections (see the section of this solicitation titled 'Forms 
Which Must Be
Completed and Submitted With Phase I Applications').</dl>
<p>
<b>Volume 3 --Phase I Federal National Laboratory Involvement</b>     
<p>
This Volume will be removed from the application upon receipt and will 
not be considered in the technical evaluation.  It should be noted, 
however, that this Volume will be reviewed to ensure that the proper 
approvals for the work have or will be obtained and the work to be
performed by the laboratory is consistent with the objectives of the 
proposed Cooperative
Agreement.
<p>
Volume 3 should include a description, in detail, of the work proposed 
for performance by the Federal national laboratory in collaboration with 
the consortium.  The description must
include an identification of the laboratory, a detailed Statement of Work 
with explanations of the work tasks to be performed, budget and resource 
requirements, and the form of the
agreement with the consortium (such as a CRADA).  A letter from the 
cognizant DOE office for the laboratory must be included that approves 
the laboratory participation in the
arrangement.
