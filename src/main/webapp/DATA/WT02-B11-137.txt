<p>
Here is some more information on the Checkfree Wallet (tm) system. I've<br>
learn about it from some reporting I've been doing on it..<br>
<p>
1) Has there been any public review of this product?<br>
<p>
Here is the basic run down<br>
<p>
It uses a 768-bit key. They claim it is not escrow-ed with the US<br>
government. It is export able to most countries except for Sudan, Cuba,<br>
North Korea, Syria, Libya, Iraq ot Iran.<br>
<p>
It encrypts limited bits of information (like Credit Card Numbers)<br>
which is why they claim it was able to get export approval.<br>
<p>
User configures the Wallet(tm) by downloading and installing and<br>
configuring it. It works with Proxy servers which I have<br>
successfully tested.<br>
<p>
It generates a public and private key pair using RSA technology.<br>
<p>
It keeps the payer anonymous to the merchant via the internet. Merchants can<br>
learn the payer's name out of band (e.g., by phone).<br>
<p>
No credit card info is stored on a merchant's site.<br>
<p>
Payment is encrypted and signed buy the payer and sent to the merchant<br>
who add's there version of the transaction and their signature. It is<br>
forwarded to check free who then decrypt, compare the payers' and<br>
merchant's view of the transaction and if they agree process it.<br>
<p>
It use is very very quick and easy. It auto configures itself to<br>
Netscape. Payment information is sent to the Wallet (TM) from the<br>
merchant in a Mime segment, which triggers a launch of the Wallet, the<br>
payer binds in their credit card data (all ready at Checkfree (at<br>
installation) e.g., which card to use. Then the whole thing is sent to<br>
the merchant then the onto Checkfree for processing as indicated<br>
above.<br>
<p>
I was very impressed with the software and it's easy of use. Currently<br>
only works on Windows but soon on the Mac..<br>
