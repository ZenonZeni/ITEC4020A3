<H1><A NAME="HDRGLO" HREF="icsur007.html#PToC_74">Appendix C. Glossary</A></H1>
<P>
This glossary defines terms used by the Internet Connection Secure Server.
<DL>
<P><DT>accessory script
<DD>A CGI script program that processes SEARCH, POST, PUT, or DELETE
requests.
The accessory scripts process requests that are not explicitly
mapped to a CGI script program named on an EXEC directive.
<P><DT>address
<DD>The unique code assigned to each device or
workstation connected to a network.
A standard Internet address (or IP address) is a 32-bit address field.
This field contains two parts.
The first part is the network address;
the second part is the host number.
See also <I>IP address</I>.
<P><DT>agent
<DD>
In systems management, a user that, for a particular interaction,
has assumed an agent role.
<DD>
An entity that represents one or more managed objects by
(a) emitting notifications regarding the objects and
(b) handling requests from managers for management operations
to modify or query the objects.
<P><DT>alias
<DD>A name assigned to a server.
The alias makes the server independent of the name of its host machine.
The alias must be defined in the domain name server.
<P><DT>asymmetric keys
<DD>In secure communications, the two keys in a key pair.
The keys are called asymmetric because one key holds more of the
encryption pattern than the other does.
See <I>key pair</I>.
<P><DT>authentication
<DD>In secure communications, a means of verifying the identity
of a server or browser (client) with whom you wish to communicate.
A sender's authenticity is demonstrated
by the digital certificate issued to the sender.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>browser
<DD>A client program that initiates requests to a server
and displays the returned information.
<P><DT>cache
<DD>A special-purpose buffer storage, smaller and faster than main
storage, used to hold a copy of data that may be frequently accessed.
Use of a cache reduces access time,
but may increase memory requirements.
<P><DT>caching proxy server
<DD>A proxy server that can store the documents it retrieves
from other servers in a local cache.
The server can then respond to subsequent requests for the
same documents without having to retrieve them from other servers.
This can improve response time.
<P><DT>CERN
<DD>Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire (European Laboratory
for Particle Physics).
Located in Geneva, CERN initiated the World Wide Web,
and was the first to create a Web server.
The CERN Web server is the basis for many commercially
available servers, such as IBM's Internet Connection Secure Server.
<P><DT>certificate
<DD>In secure communications, a digital document that binds
an encryption key to the identity of the certificate owner,
so that the certificate owner can be authenticated.
A certificate is issued by a certification authority (CA).
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>certificate</I>, and
<I>certification authority (CA)</I>.
<P><DT>certification authority (CA)
<DD>In secure communications,
a trusted third party (such as VeriSign, Inc.)
or a designated internal authority who issues certificates.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>CGI (common gateway interface)
<DD>A standard interface between Web servers and external programs.
CGI scripts are programs that use this interface to perform tasks
not usually done by the server, such as form processing.
<P><DT>CGI program
<DD>A program that uses the common gateway interface (CGI)
to perform tasks not usually done by the server, such as form processing.
CGI programs can be written in any language supported by the operating
system on which the server is run.
The language can be a scripting language or a programming language.
<P><DT>client
<DD>A computer system or process that requests a service of
another computer system or process.
For example, a workstation or personal computer
requesting HTML documents from an IBM Internet Connection Secure Server
is a client of the IBM Internet Connection Secure Server it connects to.
<P><DT>configuration file
<DD>A file that describes the devices, optional features, communications
parameters, and programs installed on a workstation.
For Internet Connection Secure Server, the configuration file is named httpd.cnf
and by default is put in the path specified
on the SET ETC statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.
The configuration file contains directives
that define the various settings for the server.
<P><DT>cookie
<DD>A general mechanism that server-side connections, such as
CGI scripts, can use to store information on the
client side of the connection for later retrieval.
For example, a retail Web site can
store per-user preferences on the client, and have the client supply
those preferences every time that site is connected to.  A cookie
is introduced to the client in a Set-Cookie header, which is included
as part of an HTTP response.
<P><DT>default
<DD>A value, attribute, or option that is assumed
when none is explicitly specified.
<P><DT>directive
<DD>A statement used in the Internet Connection Secure Server configuration file
to define a particular setting for the server.
<P><DT>directory
<DD>A named grouping of files in a file system.
<P><DT>Distinguished Name
<DD>In secure communications, the name and address of the person
and organization to whom a certificate has been issued.
See also <I>certificate</I>.
<P><DT>document root directory
<DD>The primary directory where a Web server stores accessible documents.
When the server receives requests that do not point to a specific
directory, it tries to serve the request from this directory.
<P><DT>domain
<DD>In an internet, a part of the naming hierarchy.
A domain name consists of a sequence
of names (labels) separated by periods (dots).
<P><DT>domain name
<DD>A name of a host system in a network.
A domain name consists of a sequence
of names (labels) separated by periods (dots).
<P><DT>domain name server
<DD>A server program that supplies address-to-name
translation by mapping Internet addresses to domain names.
Use of a domain name server allows users
to request services of another computer using a symbolic name,
which is easier to remember than an Internet address.
<P><DT>dotted-decimal notation
<DD>The syntactical representation for a 32-bit integer that consists of
four 8-bit numbers, written in base 10 and separated by periods (dots).
It is used to represent IP addresses.

<DD>A file containing executable code and data bound to a program
at load time or run time.  The code and data in a dynamic link
library can be shared by several applications simultaneously.
<P><DT>encryption
<DD>In secure communications, a means of scrambling data
to prevent the data from being read by
anyone other than the intended recipient.
The sender uses a key to encrypt the message;
the recipient uses the decryption key.
See also <I>key</I> and <I>key pair</I>.
<P><DT>file extension
<DD>The last part of a file&#39;s name, following the period (dot).
For example, in the filename welcome.html, the file extension is html.

an algorithmic pattern used by a sender to encrypt messages,
and by a recipient to decrypt messages.
See also <I>encryption</I>, <I>key pair</I>, and
<I>key ring</I>.
<P><DT>key pair
<DD>In secure communications, a public key and a private key.
The sender uses the private key to encrypt the message;
the recipient uses the public key to decrypt the message.
Because the private key holds more of the encryption pattern
than the public key does, the key pair is called asymmetric.
See also <I>public key</I> and <I>private key</I>.
<P><DT>key ring

services can rate Web information.  Internet users can then request
the ratings as a way to preview and filter Web information for
acceptable content.
<P><DT>port
<DD>An end point for communication between applications,
generally referring to a logical connection.
A port provides queues for sending and receiving data.
Each port has a port number for identification.
When the port number is combined with an Internet address,
it is called a socket address.
<P><DT>private key
<DD>In secure communications, an algorithmic pattern used
to encrypt messages that can be decrypted only
by the corresponding public key.
A private key is also used to decrypt messages
that were encrypted by the corresponding public key.

in separate protection setup files, or by using the
Configuration and Administration forms.
<P><DT>protocol
<DD>The set of rules governing the operation of functional units of a
communication system if communication is to take place.
Protocols can determine low-level details of machine-to-machine
interfaces, such as the order in which bits from a byte are sent;
they can also determine high-level exchanges
between application programs, such as file transfer.
<P><DT>proxy gateway
<DD>A type of firewall that protects computers in a business network
from access by users outside that network.
See also <I>firewall</I>.
