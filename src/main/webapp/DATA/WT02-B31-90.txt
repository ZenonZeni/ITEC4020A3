<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>IRAs: Still One of the Best Ways to
Save</STRONG></FONT><P>


Most retirement experts agree that you will need about 70%-75% of your
working
income to maintain
your current lifestyle in retirement. Unfortunately, Social Security
will provide
only a portion of this
income. According to the Social Security Administration, the average
monthly Social
Security check in
1994 was just $674.  Factor in that most Americans are living longer
and it becomes
clear that you will
need additional sources of income if you hope to live comfortably in
retirement.
<P>
<STRONG>A Simple and Effective Retirement Planning Tool</STRONG><BR>
One of the easiest ways to start building wealth and saving for
retirement is
through an Individual
Retirement Account (IRA). An IRA is a tax-deferred vehicle that
provides you with
the opportunity to
invest in various instruments. These include: stocks, bonds,
money-market funds,
government
securities, unit investment trusts, and mutual funds.<P>
Since the IRA is a tax-deferred account, all of your contributions and
earnings
will compound and
accumulate quicker than money placed in a similar taxable account. Over
the long
haul, this tax
advantage will significantly increase your retirement nest egg.
<P>
<STRONG>Eligibility Requirements</STRONG><BR>
Anyone who receives compensation for working during the year (including
wages,
salaries,
commissions, and professional fees) can establish an IRA. The maximum
amount you
may contribute
per year is the lesser of $2,000 or 100% of your annual
compensation.<P>
If you have a non-working spouse, you may contribute an additional $250
into the
plan on your spouse's
behalf. This would increase the maximum contribution for the year to
$2,250. The
contribution would
have to be made into two separate accounts and may be divided in any
fashion as
long as no more
than $2,000 is contributed to either IRA. The extra account is called a
spousal
IRA.  
<P>
<STRONG>IRA Deductibility Limits</STRONG><BR>
If both you and your spouse are employed, but are not considered active
participants in your employer's
qualified retirement plans, your IRA contributions are fully
deductible. (Two
individual IRAs must be set
up.) If you and your spouse file a joint tax return, a maximum
deduction of $4,000
would be allowed.
This deduction will reduce your taxable income and your current income
tax bill.  
If both you and your spouse participate in your employer's qualified
retirement
plans, your deduction for
your contribution may be reduced or eliminated depending on your annual
adjusted
gross income.
Singles with adjusted gross incomes of $25,000 or less and married
couples with
adjusted gross
incomes of $40,000 or less can deduct their entire IRA contribution. As
your annual
income increases,
the amount you can deduct gradually decreases. Deductions are reduced
by $200 for
every $1,000 of
income over $40,000 ($25,000 for singles).  
<P>
<STRONG>The Power Of Tax Deferral</STRONG><BR>
Even if you cannot deduct your annual contribution, IRAs still offer a
powerful
advantage - tax-deferred
growth. All of the earnings on amounts contributed to an IRA are not
taxed until
they are withdrawn. For
example, if you were to invest $2,000 annually, assuming an 8% return
and a 33%
combined federal,
state, and local income tax bracket, after 30 years, a tax-deferred
account could
potentially grow to
$244,692.  Under this same scenario, a taxable account would have grown
to
$148,971. That is
$95,721, or 64%, more in the tax-deferred account than in the taxable
account.<SUP><FONT

<P>

<STRONG>Time Is Still Available</STRONG><BR>
An IRA should serve as the cornerstone for your retirement plan.
Whether retirement
is years away or
just around the corner, you owe it to yourself to prepare now for a
future that's
free of financial worry.
Implementing a disciplined approach to investing can put you on the
path toward
your retirement
dreams. You have until April 15, 1996 to make the maximum 1995
contribution of
$2,000. And instead
of waiting another full year, you could invest $4,000 today (for 1996
and 1997) and
let the power of tax
deferral start working toward your retirement dreams.

Withdrawals
from an
IRA are taxable and, if you are under age 59 1/2, you may be subject to
an IRS
penalty. This example is for illustrative purposes only and does not
reflect the
tax due on funds
withdrawn from the tax-deferred account. Withdrawals of funds from an
IRA must
begin by age 70 1/2 or
a penalty may be imposed.</FONT>
