The DRAGON Roars in Automotive Supply
</H1>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
The dragon is the national emblem of Wales. Apparently, no one really knows why. 
<P>But when it comes to the why and the how of developing an automotive manufacturing infrastructure for components, the people in Wales know that it is essential, so they are establishing world-class companies to do it.

<P>&quot;<B>Devastation&quot;</B> is a word that Dennis Turner, director, Source Wales, Welsh Development Agency (Cardiff), uses to describe the conditions that existed in Wales some 20 years ago. The coal mines and steel mills that had employed thousands of people in the small country (population: 2.89 million) had closed or downsized. For example, in 1980 there were 35 working coal mines. In 1995, just two pits were operating.

<P>Although this is not an unusual situation, as many industrialized places on the planet have undergone 
similar downturns, the Welsh response is extraordinary. A primary focus of the turnaround strategy has been to make Wales a better place for automotive supply firms to setup shop.

<P>One methodology that some regions and municipalities have used to attract such firms is to give tax incentives. Which is certainly helpful (although some economists question the usefulness).

<P>But what the Welsh Development Agency (WDA) is doing is certainly more compelling from the standpoint of manufacturing than simply reducing the cost of location (although there is that, too). Through its Source Wales initiative, there are extensive programs underway to establish firms as world-class suppliers in Wales. &quot;We are supply-chain oriented because we are a nation of suppliers,&quot; Turner says. And there is a thorough understanding that with the consolidation of suppliers on a global scale, the Wales-based operations--assuming that they are interested in survival--need to be among the best found anywhere.

<P>Wales? The land of Tom Jones, Richard Burton, Dylan Thomas, the Prince of, and that famous really long place name (Llanfair-pwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllanty-siliogogogoch)? Automotive suppliers?

<P>The country doesn't itself have any auto assembly plants. (Prof. Garel Rhys, director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research at the Cardiff Business School, University of Wales, comments about the lack of assembly plants: &quot;We've done better in some ways not to have one.&quot; He explains that car assembly plants tend to be more fixed as compared with component plants: should there be market changes, the component producer is in a better position to quickly respond.)

<P>But there are nearby facilities of companies such as Toyota and Rover (in the England part of the U.K.). Ford 
has a substantial engine plant in Bridgend, Wales, and a transmission plant in Swansea. A goal of Source Wales is to 
get business from these firms and others like them (Honda, Nissan, Vauxhall. . .) for the 150 or so automotive suppliers in Wales (indigenous and foreign-owned). Another goal is to attract, and to develop, new suppliers. Automotive is 
the single biggest manufacturing industry in Wales. And the list of companies that have located facilities in Wales 
contains extremely familiar names: Calsonic, Lucas, Borg-Warner, Rockwell, ITT Automotive, Trico, TRW, and many more.

<P>Consider this: When coal mines and steel mills are shut down, there are lots of pieces of real estate that are 
blighted. So the people at Source Wales buy up properties in that category, have its Land Reclamation outfit go at them, 
and not only make them usable, buildable sites, but actually construct buildings on them in some cases. These are then sold, leased or rented to manufacturing companies. This initiative garners about half of the organization's annual budget. The Welsh land reclamation people have become so good at what they do, they have established an international reputation and are now involved in projects for companies and governments around the world.

<P>The WDA isn't specifically involved in providing funding for companies to buy equipment (there are people in the Welsh Office, the central bureaucracy for Wales connected to the government in London who are involved in granting; the WDA people work directly with them). But it does work to leverage and improve a company's capabilities. Indeed, one interesting aspect is that Source Wales works with companies on a Japanese-developed methodology called &quot;<I>kyoryoku kai</I>.&quot; This has as its end the improvement of all of the suppliers that are working for a particular customer.

<P>Source Wales is keenly interested in making sure that if a supplier is recommended to a customer, it is a supplier who can and will meet the customer's requirements without fail. So there is extensive benchmarking performed of companies, based on metrics devised by Motorola. Once companies have information about themselves through self-audits, they can determine where their weaknesses are. Source Wales can then bring together some companies with similar problems and create what are called &quot;Manufacturing Improvement Networks,&quot; through which improvements in these weak areas can be realized.

<P>But it is the <I>kyoryoku kai</I>, or supplier association program, that really can mean a boon to customers as well as 
to suppliers. So far, they have organized two groups: one for Toyota consisting of nine Welsh suppliers; one for Rover consisting of 22 companies. What happens is that the companies work together on developing their capabilities 
with regard to such things as quality, cost, flexibility, productivity, lead time, and new product development. Each 
company is able to leverage itself through the consolidated efforts of the group; the customer is able to achieve a superior group of suppliers working for it. The customer picks the area of interest, then the vendors work toward developing themselves in that area. Generally there are two or three workshops, two management seminars, and visits to outstanding plants during the course of a year. So far, there have been measured improvements in quality by a factor of 10, with tier-one suppliers having a defect rate of just 5 ppm. Turner claims that there are more suppliers in Wales involved in <I>kyoryoku kai</I> than in any other country in the Western world.

<P>Another important consideration is to maintain a good supply base at the first tier, then work to develop 
companies at the second and third tiers. In a presentation made in London earlier this year, Garel Rhys noted, &quot;There is a sufficient core of major U.K. firms capable of being first-tier suppliers, to the benefit of U.K. firms whose destiny it is to be second tier <I>if they can make the transition to best-practice operations</I>.&quot; (Emphasis added).

<P>The emphasis at Source Wales <I>is</I> on best practices. Which are certainly valuable to companies whether they're operating in a country where the national food is laverbread (fried seaweed with a slice of bacon on top) or hot dogs.<BR>
<B>An Outstanding Mission</B>
<P>Certainly one of the best mission statements we've ever come across is from TRW Steering Systems Ltd., Resolven, Wales, which provides power and manual steering systems to Ford, Honda, Nissan, Rover, and Volvo:

<P>&quot;To be the manufacturer of Steering Systems cited as the role model by our competitors' employees.

<P><I>&quot;Acclaimed by our customers as the supplier which all other suppliers should strive to emulate.&quot;</I>

<P>When your competitors' people believe that your place is where the action is, then you've really got something. When your customers are using you as the benchmark for other customers, then it is hard to imagine that you'd lose their business.

<P>TRW Steering Systems Ltd., which employs approximately 900 people, celebrated its 50th anniversary in June. Chances are that the firm will remain a solid supplier as it is collaborating with the Welsh Development Agency and the Neath Borough Council in the development of an automotive supplier park on a 10-acre site adjacent to the TRW property. This park is expected to be able to support some 300 jobs in the area.

<P>Wanted: MORE VOLUME
<P>Professor Garel Rhys is the director of the Centre for Automotive Industry Research, Cardiff Business School, University of Wales, among other things. For example, he's also an OBE--just like the Beatles. And he assists the Welsh Development Agency.

<P>Speaking of the auto scene in western Europe, Rhys remarks, &quot;The pickup truck is used to carry 
rubble.&quot; Which is not a point to offend those millions of Americans who drive pickups as their ordinary mode of transportation. Rather, it is to make a point about the size of the European automarket which, by his reckoning, is actually larger than that in the U.S. In 1991-92, car sales in western Europe measured 13.5 million units. Rhys estimates that there is an upward trend right now that may peak in 1999 at 14.2 million units.
