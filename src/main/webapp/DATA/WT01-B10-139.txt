This year's Formula SAE Team, with Professor Albert R. George as advisor,
designed and built a formula race car for the national competition at the
Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan. Of the 84 cars entered from the US and
Canada, Cornell achieved third place overall in the &quot;Spirit of Excellence
Award,&quot; achieving 850 points out of a total of 1000. The Cornell entry
placed first in the acceleration race, first in safety-crashworthiness,
second in the endurance race, third is exhaust technology, third in static
events, and fourth in the design and presentation events. A total of $3,000
was collected in prize money. Gordon Day led the Chassis Team this year,
Chris Hult was the leader of the Business and Planning Group, and C. J.
Kalebjian led the Engine Team.<BR>

The Hybrid Electric Vehicle Team (HEV), under the guidance of Professors
Richard Warkentin of the Sibley School and Robert Thomas from Electrical
Engineering, participated in two national competitions this year. A hybrid
electric automobile was designed and constructed from the ground up, incorporating
a small internal combustion engine to charge the batteries in an otherwise
all-battery-powered vehicle. In March the team placed second overall in
the Department of Energy Advanced Student Hybrid (DASH) competition in Los
Angeles, California. The Cornell entry placed first for best use of materials,
first for consumer acceptance, and took second-place honors in the technical
report, acceleration, emission and fuel economy categories.<BR>

In May the team entered the Tour de Sol competition, a drive from Waterbury,
Connecticut to Portland, Maine. Fifty cars competed in the &quot;Production,
American Commuter, Hybrid and Open&quot; classes of the event. Tempest,
the Cornell entry, placed 9th overall and won 1st place in Fuel Efficiency
and 2nd place in Distance, both being awarded in the Hybrid Class. The Cornell
car traveled 433 miles during the rally, achieving a 93 mpg equivalency
rating on its best day, using a full battery charge and its CNG engine.<BR>

Co-Project Managers this year, J. P. O'Brien and Tara Wilson, both were
seniors in Mechanical Engineering. <BR>
