<body><h2>Message from the Director</h2>
<hr>
<strong>Background </strong><br>
In December of 1994, as the product of an extensive review of the Program, consultation with a
broad spectrum of stakeholders, and a comprehensive strategic planning cycle, we published the
<em>Civilian Radioactive Waste Management Program Plan</em>. That plan outlined an approach to
accomplish the principal objectives of the Program with reasonable target dates and at substantially
reduced cost compared to earlier estimates. It remained, however, within the statutory and regulatory
framework governing the site suitability process for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization
Project and preserved the programmatic expectations and definitions that had evolved from that
framework. 
<p>
The Administration proposed the new program approach in its Fiscal Year 1995 budget request and
the Congress approved the funding for the first year of the Program, a 37 percent increase over the
previous fiscal year. Utilizing the Fiscal Year 1995 funding, and drawing upon the extensive
scientific and analytical work already available, we have made a great deal of progress. 
<p>
The Yucca Mountain Project completed a total system performance assessment that provides
important insights into the critical factors that will affect the ability of the engineered and geologic
features of a repository to meet long-term standards of public health and safety. Guided by these
insights we are refining a waste containment and isolation strategy that, in turn, will focus the future
scientific and engineering work on the critical factors. We will emphasize the scientific data
collection and analyses required to confirm the hypotheses underlying the waste isolation strategy
and concentrate our near-term design effort on the critical technological requirements of the
engineered barriers. Finally, the exploratory tunnel has penetrated the repository formation itself and
is beginning to provide solid confirmation of the general theory of the site conditions that has been
developed from surface indications, drilling, and seismic work. 
<p>
With regard to the Program's waste acceptance responsibilities, any future scenario of at-reactor
storage, consolidated interim storage, and ultimate disposal will require an extensive transportation
effort to remove spent fuel from reactor sites. A new generation of storage and transportation casks
and canisters will have to be available to provide a comprehensive ability to service all fuel and all
sites, to enhance standardization of equipment and operations, and to improve system-wide
economics. In Fiscal Year 1995, the Program continued its work on transportation casks and initiated
a major contract intended to make the first high-capacity, comprehensive multi-purpose canister
system available to the marketplace by 1998. 
<p>
<strong>Fiscal Year 1996 Funding Impacts </strong><br>

The Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation to the Program did not support the continuation of that program
approach. Instead, the funding made available to the Program for expenditure is about 40 percent
below the Fiscal Year 1995 level. The Congressional guidance accompanying the appropriation was
to concentrate the work at Yucca Mountain on the most significant outstanding technical and
engineering issues and to defer licensing activities as required by the funding constraint. 
<p>
A portion of the appropriation was withheld from expenditure pending the enactment of new
authorizing legislation addressing interim storage. That legislation has not yet been enacted. 
<p>
The Program's first responsibility was to reduce its rate of expenditure to meet the restrictions of the
Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation. In doing so, the Congressional guidance was followed. To the extent
possible, the continuity of the core scientific work at Yucca Mountain, including progress on the
underground exploration, has been preserved. Outside of the Yucca Mountain Project, the Program
activities have been reduced to carrying out its responsibilities for oversight of the Nuclear Waste
Fund and of the contractual arrangements with nuclear utilities; limited coordination with
transportation-related organizations; and only the necessary program-wide planning, management
and administrative functions. Canister technology development activities have had to be terminated.
<p>
<strong>Proposed Future Program </strong>
<br>
Planning for the Administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request had been initiated prior to the
final 1996 appropriation action. In response to the new funding situation, the Program and the
Administration immediately had to decide upon a long-term program plan to support the Fiscal Year
1997 budget request for the Program. There were three potential directions that could be considered
for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project: 
<ul>
<li>     propose to return to the funding levels required to reestablish the previous program approach;
<li>    consistent with Congressional guidance and the Fiscal Year 1996 funding level, convert the
Project to a long-term research effort without firm targets for repository licensing; or 
<li>     prepare a new, more concentrated program plan that can regain a target for a license application within a reasonable time, but which requires only moderately increased funding in future years. 
</ul>
The Administration has chosen the third option and has incorporated it into the Fiscal Year 1997
budget proposal now pending before the Congress. The strong foundation of strategic planning that
we had already developed and the recent convergence of more than a decade of scientific and
engineering work at the site have made that option feasible. 
<p>
In accordance with the Secretary's objectives for re-engineering of the Department and greater
privatization, and consistent with the direction of the policy debate taking place in the Congress, we
have also revised our program approach for the waste acceptance, storage, and transportation
activities. We will place greater reliance upon the marketplace and utilize appropriately structured
contractual arrangements to acquire the needed technologies and the logistical capability to carry out
these responsibilities.  
<p>
The revision to our December 1994 Program Plan presented in this document outlines the revised
approach that is associated with the Administration's Fiscal Year 1997 budget request. The necessity
to respond quickly to the unanticipated Fiscal Year 1996 appropriation actions and to concurrently
develop a Fiscal Year 1997 budget proposal foreclosed the opportunity for an extensive consultative
process during the development of this plan. The new plan, however, flows naturally from previous
planning efforts. Its essential elements will be familiar to those who have closely followed our
strategic planning process and the implementation of the Program in Fiscal Years 1995 and 1996.
The major policy redirections have evolved out of the Congressional appropriations process in which
many of our stakeholders have actively participated. 
<p>
In this document we describe the work plan and schedule we propose to pursue. In a formal
rulemaking that will be initiated soon, we will propose, and consider comments on, the process for
completing the site suitability determination and the possible subsequent activities leading to a
license application for the Yucca Mountain Site Characterization Project. We also will soon be
initiating preliminary discussions with potential participants in the transportation service
procurement process. If the Congress approves our Fiscal Year 1997 budget request, we will
continue the Environmental Impact Statement process for the Yucca Mountain Project that has been
suspended in Fiscal Year 1996. These formal processes, together with the continuing regular
interactions with our oversight bodies and stakeholders, will provide the comment and advice we
need to further refine the plan. 
<p>
The program approach outlined in this document is consistent with the statutory basis for the
Program and with our organizational mission. It preserves the essential program objectives, and it
serves the needs of our customers within the authorities given us. It rests upon several key premises. 
<p>
The Yucca Mountain Project will strive to reach an early conclusion of the site investigation. We
will concentrate our resources on the most significant outstanding technical issues first. By 1998,
we will assemble the wealth of scientific data already available in a system performance assessment
to evaluate the behavior of a repository in the geologic setting. With focused design efforts we will
ascertain that the technologies exist to construct a repository in that setting. We will also assess the
technical, economic, and practical feasibility of the licensing and construction of the repository. If
the repository appears to be viable, we will complete the work and pursue the process required by
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to make a formal recommendation of the site to the President and to
present an acceptable license application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by the year 2002.
<p>
Concurrently, we will develop an approach and a capability to transport and store spent nuclear fuel
with the greatest possible reliance upon the marketplace. 
<p>
This approach is an appropriate modification of our Program to reflect the increased comprehension
of the Yucca Mountain site, the current outlook for Federal budgetary policy in general, and the
ongoing policy process concerning civilian radioactive waste management in particular.
