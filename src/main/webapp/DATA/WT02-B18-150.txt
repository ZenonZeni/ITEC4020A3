<img src="cytrx.gif" ><B><FONT SIZE=4 >CytRx Corporation --
Human Critical Care Pharmaceuticals</FONT></B><BR>

RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>  is
a unique, patented surfactant copolymer that significantly reduces
blood viscosity and inhibits platelet adhesion. In a Phase II
clinical trial, RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I> showed statistically
significant benefits in reducing the severe pain that patients
suffering from acute sickle cell crisis must endure. This trial
also indicated that RheothRx<I><SUB>pf</SUB></I>  may reduce the
duration of hospital stays. This is an important market for CytRx
as each year there are approximately 100,000 hospital admissions
for acute sickle cell crisis as well as a large number of patients
who suffer at home. Reducing the duration and severity of crisis
could provide significant health benefits as over time, organ
systems deteriorate due to damage caused by each sickle cell crisis.

Vaccine Delivery System</FONT></B><BR>

Vaxcel's Optivax is a novel
approach to improving vaccine effectiveness. Optivax offers the
potential to increase the potency of vaccines as well as to enable
single-dose formulations for vaccines that currently require multiple
injections. Optivax is being made available to vaccine companies
on an antigen by antigen basis. Vaxcel recently announced the
licensing of its Optivax&#174; vaccine delivery system to be used
to enhance the effectiveness of vaccines being developed by Corixa
Corporation. Connaught Laboratories and Medeva, Plc are also evaluating
Optivax with vaccines they are developing. A Phase I human clinical
trial studying Optivax in combination with a cancer vaccine was
begun in January. <A  HREF="vaxcel2.htm"><B>[MORE]</B></A><BR>
