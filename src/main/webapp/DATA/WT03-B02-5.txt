UNIV. OF PA DOCTORS SETTLE WITH GOVT. ON FALSE CLAIMS

     Without admitting wrongdoing, the approximately 600 doctors
of the University of Pennsylvania's medical faculty agreed to pay
$30 million to deflect further government action for false
Medicare claims revealed by auditors.  United States v.
University of Pennsylvania Health System (ED PA).

     According to published reports, audits of the Clinical
Practices of the University of Pennsylvania (CPUP), which
comprises Penn's faculty, revealed approximately $10 million in
false billing to Medicare from 1989 to mid-1994.  The false
claims were reported to be of two types: (1) "upcoding" " where
Medicare was billed for more expensive procedures or examinations
than those actually performed; and (2) billing by faculty doctors
for procedures actually performed by resident doctors in
training.  This latter category represents "double dipping,"
since Medicare already pays for teaching costs in its direct
reimbursement to hospitals.

     The settlement, entered into by the parties Dec. 12,
requires CPUP to pay the government $30,013,490 in reimbursement
for the false claims, with the remaining $20-odd million
constituting a monetary penalty.  In return, the government
releases CPUP from civil liability and potential exclusion from
participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

     CPUP is not released from liability under the Internal
Revenue Code nor from criminal prosecution by the settlement.  In
fact, the settlement specifies that CPUP may not label the
settlement as punitive for the purpose of invoking a double
jeopardy defense to any criminal charges.  The settlement also
does not preclude the government from pursuing civil actions
against individual doctors.

     The settlement binds CPUP to continue the implementation of
a compliance program.  According to the compliance program
summary, "CPUP is committed to providing the highest quality
medical care to all patients in full compliance with billing
requirements."  The compliance program includes: (1) the
centralization of billing functions beginning with centralized
inpatient chart abstraction; (2) annual external audits and
continuous internal audits through the creation of a new Office
of Billing Compliance; (3) the continuation of the mandatory
education and training of physicians and billing personnel begun
in mid-1994; and (4) the establishment of two telephone lines
dedicated to billing information and reporting.

     However, the settlement may not be the last word on CPUP's
billing practices.  According to Doug Smith, a spokesman for
Pennsylvania Blue Shield, Medicare's fiscal intermediary in
Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Blue Shield has begun its own
intensive investigation of CPUP.  Smith said that its
investigation arose out of its normal provider utilization
reviews simultaneous with the government's investigation.  He
indicated that Blue Shield and the federal government have been
working together on the matter following receipt of a letter from
an anonymous tipster describing CPUP's fraudulent billing
practices.

     There is no timeframe for the completion of the
investigation, says Smith, but he said Blue Shield will be
thorough in an effort to recoup any monies overbilled.  According
to published reports, Blue Shield sells "Medigap" insurance under
its "Security 65" plan to 800,000 Pennsylvanians over age 65.
Smith says that Blue Shield investigators will look at claims
filed under that plan as well as those under its regular and HMO
plans.

8TH CIR. MODIFIES STANCE ON INSURERS' OBLIGATION TO ASSURE
PAYMENT

     Health care insurers are not necessarily excused from
providing assurances of payment to plan participants under the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a panel of the Eighth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held recently.  Henderson et al. v.
Bodine Aluminum et al., No. 95-2469 (8th Cir.).

     The panel's amended opinion follows its earlier grant of a
preliminary injunction barring Bodine Aluminum, Inc. from
refusing to cover the high-dosage chemotherapy treatment (HDCT)
needed by breast cancer sufferer Karen E. Henderson, the wife of
a Bodine employee and beneficiary to its health care plan.  The
panel found the exclusion on HDCT for breast cancer contained in
Bodine's plan to be discriminatory because the HDCT was not
excluded for other cancers for which it is an accepted treatment.

     In its original Sept. 27 decision, the panel held, "We agree
with the appellees Healthy Alliance Life Insurance Company and
Alliance Blue Cross and Blue Shield that because they do not
employ Henderson's husband but merely provide insurance services
to Bodine Aluminum, Inc. and its health benefits program, they
are not responsible for giving the assurance of payment that [the
plaintiffs] seek.  The...appellees are not covered under the
ADA."

               However, the panel, in amending its opinion on Oct. 31,
backed off a clear conclusion on the insurers' responsibilities.
The amended opinion reads, "Appellees...argue that because they
do not employ Henderson's husband but merely provide insurance
services to Bodine Aluminum, Inc. and its health benefits
program, they are not responsible for giving the assurance of
payment that [the plaintiff] seeks.  We express no opinion on
this issue, leaving it instead to be decided in the first
instance by the district court."

     The panel went on to note that its findings of fact and
conclusions of law in granting a preliminary injunction to the
plaintiff were not binding on the district court "so that none of
the substantive issues discussed in this opinion are foreclosed
from being litigated on remand."

     When contacted by the Health Law , Henderson's attorney,
Sheldon Weinhaus of Weinhaus and Dobson in St. Louis, said he
moved for an amended opinion because he was "upset with the
exculpation of Blue Cross."

     "Insurers act far more than simply issuing an insurance
policy," said Weinhaus.  Weinhaus noted for example that insurers
often reserve the power to act as plan sponsors and change
benefit levels, making them de facto employers.

     Since Henderson's participation in the HDCT trials was
randomized, and she ultimately received only an "intensive"
regimen of chemotherapy that Blue Cross would have paid for,
Weinhaus advised that the district court asked the parties to
address why the action should not be dismissed as moot.  Weinhaus
said that the matter of damages remains at issue.  Also remaining
at issue is the question of what happens should the intensive
chemotherapy prove inadequate and Henderson needs the HDCT
treatment, said Weinhaus.

SC MAN ASKS 4TH CIR. TO REVIEW STATE HEALTH POOL'S HIV EXCLUSION

     A Columbia, SC, man with AIDS on Dec. 4 asked the Fourth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to review a federal judge's recent
ruling that the South Carolina Health Insurance Pool (SCHIP) does
not violate the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) by refusing
coverage for persons with HIV and AIDS.  Givens v. South Carolina
Health Insurance Pool et al., No. 95-2791 (4th Cir.).

     On July 14, U.S. District Judge Dennis Shedd said plaintiff
Samuel P. Givens Jr. could not challenge the SCHIP's restriction
under the ADA because ADA Section 501(c) bars the act from being
construed to prohibit "underwriting..., classifying..., and
administering...risks that are based on or not inconsistent with
State law."  The judge, who did not reach the Pool's claim that
it is not an ADA-covered entity, said the statutory decision to
exclude people with HIV and AIDS "is essentially an underwriting
decision," and that "HIV and AIDS are legitimate risk
classifications for underwriting purposes."

     In his appeal, Givens, who was substituted for now-deceased
original plaintiff John Doe in 1994, says the ruling is wrong
because HIV/AIDS is the only disease singled out by SCHIP.  He
adds that the ruling was entered despite the state's failure to
submit supporting actuarial data that persons with HIV/AIDS are
more costly to care for than those with cancer, heart disease or
other ailments.  He observes the irony that while he was denied
admittance, the Pool was created in 1989 by the South Carolina
General Assembly expressly to provide coverage "to all residents
of South Carolina denied insurance due to a preexisting health
condition."

     "Since it began operating, the Pool has followed the
statutory mandate to exclude people with HIV/AIDS from coverage
for medical care of any condition," said Givens' Fourth Circuit
petition.  "The Pool has no knowledge of any research undertaken
by the South Carolina General Assembly to estimate how many South
Carolina residents have HIV/AIDS and would qualify for Pool
coverage and the impact their inclusion on the Pool would have."
The petition said SCHIP has yet to conduct such research itself.

     "It is not surprising that the Pool offered no evidence to
justify the exclusion of people with HIV/AIDS alone because there
is no evidence that could ever support the exclusion," Givens
argued.  "Study after study has shown that the costs of treating
HIV/AIDS are comparable to, and oftentimes less than, the costs
of treating other medical conditions.  While not a substitute for
sound actuarial data, these studies are instructive and
demonstrate that there is no basis for excluding only people with
HIV/AIDS from the Pool."

     Givens estimated that although the lifetime costs of
treating HIV/AIDS averages in the "$60-80,000 range" and is not
covered by SCHIP, all other diseases are covered, including end
stage renal disease, "estimated at $175,000," multiple sclerosis,
"$207,000," and cancers, which he said "generally cost $114,000
for a lifetime of treatment."  He offered no comparison of the
rates of frequency between HIV/AIDS and the other ailments.

     He concluded by reiterating that the Pool is a covered
entity of the ADA by virtue of the ADA's self-stated application
to "public entit[ies]" including "any department, agency, ...or
other instrumentality of a state," 42 U.S.C. Section 12115(1)(B).

     Givens is represented by Peter Tepley of Turnipseed &
Associates, and Doak Wolfe, both of Columbia, SC; and by Marc
Elovitz, Matthew Coles and Ruth Harlow of the American Civil
Liberties Union Foundation in New York City.  SCHIP is
represented by Douglas McKay Jr. and Ruskin C. Foster of McKay,
McKay, Henry & Foster, also in Columbia.

SUP. CT. ASKED TO REVIEW PA'S CONDITIONS ON MEDICAID-FUNDED
ABORTIONS

     The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by petition for writ of
certiorari filed Nov. 22, seeks Supreme Court review of a Third
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision invalidating
Pennsylvania's reporting and physician certification requirements
for Medicaid-funded abortions.  Knoll et al. v. Elizabeth
Blackwell Health Center for Women et al., No. 95-820 (U.S.).

     The circuit panel had adjudged that the requirements were
preempted by the 1994 version of the Hyde Amendment, a rider to
appropriations legislation that has governed in various forms
Medicaid coverage of abortions since 1976.

     The petitioners assert that the Third Circuit panel "upset
the balance of federal-state relations in a way which justifies
the Court's review" by "extend[ing] an unwarranted deference to
the decisions of a sub-cabinet level official" and by "allow[ing]
those decisions to override an otherwise valid state statute."

     Citing the U.S. Supreme Court's opinion in Gregory v.
Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991), the petitioners maintain that if
Congress intended to alter the constitutional balance between the
federal government and the states, it must do so clearly and
unequivocally.  The petitioners note that the panel agreed that
the Hyde Amendment is silent with respect to the reporting
requirements at issue, but that the majority looked to
"bureaucratic fiat" to discern congressional intent.

     The petitioners also argue that the Third Circuit panel's
decision raised the ancillary issues of the deference due "an
agency position first asserted in litigation," and whether the
Secretary of Health and Human Services has any rulemaking
authority under the Hyde Amendment.

     In their Dec. 19 brief in opposition, the respondents argue
that the Third Circuit panel correctly affirmed the striking down
of Pennsylvania's reporting and certification requirements as
conflicting with its "obligation under federal law to fund all
abortions for which funding is not proscribed by Congress."  This
ruling is consistent with those of six other circuits and of
numerous district courts that have not been appealed or for which
appellate rulings have not yet come down, say the respondents,
the petitioners' "attempts to manufacture the appearance of a
circuit conflict" notwithstanding.

     The respondents also deny that the panel based its decision
on "an agency interpretation first asserted in litigation."
Instead, the petitioners argue that the decision was made "on the
basis of a long-standing, properly promulgated federal
regulation" that was entitled to deference.

               Finally, the respondents assert that "because this case
revolves in large part around the peculiarities of Pennsylvania
law, a decision by this Court on the merits will have an
extremely limited application outside of Pennsylvania."  As a
result, "it would be improvident for the Court to use its limited
resources at this time to decide this case, say the respondents.

     The instant litigation had its genesis when the Elizabeth
Blackwell Health Center, a provider of first trimester abortions,
and its two co-appellees, Greater Women's Medical Fund, a
provider of general health care services to the indigent, and
CHOICE, a health care information hot line, challenged those
portions of Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act that placed
reporting requirements on women seeking Medicaid-funded abortions
for pregnancies arising from rape or incest.  Also challenged
were those provisions of the Act which require that a physician
without a pecuniary interest in performing abortions verify that
carrying the pregnancy to term would place the woman's life in
danger.

     The district court had granted summary judgment in favor of
Blackwell, noting that the 1994 version of the Hyde Amendment
lacked the reporting and physician certification requirements of
the Pennsylvania statute. The district court interpreted the
omission to indicate Congress's intent to eliminate these
requirements.

     A majority of the Third Circuit panel agreed that the
provisions of the Act at issue were preempted by the Hyde
Amendment.  The majority rejected the district court's conclusion
that by omitting reporting and physician certification
requirements from the 1994 Hyde Amendment, Congress intended to
prohibit these types of requirements.  However, the majority
deferred to the Health Care Financing Administration's
interpretation of the Hyde Amendment " that any state law not
including a waiver of the rape or incest reporting requirement in
cases where the patient is unable to comply for physical or
psychological reasons " unlawfully restricted access to abortion
services.

     Also given deference by the panel was the HCFA's
interpretation that one " and only one " physician need attest
that a patient's life would be endangered by carrying a pregnancy
to term.

     Representing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is John G.
Knorr III, Chief Deputy Attorney General and Chief, Litigation
Section, Harrisburg, PA.  Representing the respondents are Linda
J. Wharton and Susan J. Frietsche of the Women's Law Project,
Philadelphia; Mary A. McLaughlin and Cynthia L. Randall of
Dechert Price & Rhoads, Philadelphia; Kathryn Kolbert and Eve C.
Gartner of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, New York
City; and Seth Kreimer of the University of Pennsylvania School
of Law, Philadelphia.

U.S. SUP. CT. DENIES REVIEW OF INJUNCTION ON NE'S COVERAGE LIMITS

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 16 denied the State of
Nebraska's petition for review of a lower court's decision
enjoining it from enforcing its abortion coverage limits.  Nelson
et al. v. Orr et al., No. 95-766 (U.S.).

     In his Dec. 7 brief in opposition to the state's petition,
Dr. G. William Orr, a Nebraska physician, pointed out that the
Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' decision "is in complete
accord with every standing decision of the federal appellate and
district courts" to decide the question of whether "state
Medicaid programs must cover abortions for which federal funding
is not proscribed."

     Among the cases cited by Orr were Elizabeth Blackwell Health
Ctr. for Women v. Knoll, 61 F.3d 170 (3rd Cir. 1995) and Hern v.
Beye, 57 F.3d 906 (10th Cir. 1995).

     Further, Orr argued that these federal court decisions are
"supported by the structure of the federal Medicaid Act"
(Title XIX) and the Court's decision in Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S.
297 (1980).  In McRae, the Court rejected the claim that a state
had the obligation to unilaterally cover medically necessary
abortions for which federal funding was being withheld.  Orr
argued that this decision implies "that Title XIX requires states
to cover those medically necessary abortions for which the
funding obligation is not unilateral...and for which federal
funding is available under the Hyde Amendment."

     Additionally, Orr pointed out that the Health Care Financing
Administration, the federal agency charged with overseeing the
Medicaid program, had issued a directive interpreting the change
in the Hyde Amendment in a manner consistent with the Eighth
Circuit panel's ruling.  That interpretation is "entitled to
substantial deference" by the Court, said Orr.

     Finally, Orr argued that the courts below correctly ruled
that Title XIX created a federal right for which 42 U.S.C.
Section 1983 provides a remedy.  Orr distinguished Suter v.
Artist M., 503 U.S. 347 (1992), where the court found no private
right of action attached to the Adoption Assistance and Child
Welfare Act of 1980, "because no such privately enforceable right
was 'unambiguously' conferred by Congress."  Orr said that Suter
is inapplicable here since "the obligation of participating
states to provide Medicaid coverage for those medically necessary
abortions for which federal funding is available is unambiguous."

     The state of Nebraska had filed suit in the name of Gov. E.
Benjamin Nelson, after receipt of a letter from HCFA announcing a
change in the Hyde Amendment, an annual appropriations bill rider
restricting federal reimbursement for abortions.  That letter
included HCFA's interpretation that the change mandated state
funding for abortions of pregnancies resulting from rape or
incest.  At the time of receipt of the letter, Nebraska's
Medicaid Manual limited state funding to abortions where the
woman's life was in danger.

     The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the
respondents on Nov. 4, 1994, and enjoined enforcement of the
Medicaid Manual's abortion coverage limits.  A panel of the
Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the district
court's decision on July 25, 1995, holding that Title XIX
mandated that the states fund all medically necessary procedures
for which federal funding is available.

     In their Nov. 14 petition for writ of certiorari, the
petitioners asserted that the Eighth Circuit failed to recognize
Nebraska's authority under Title XIX to create coverage plans
"which are reasonable and consistent with the objectives of the
Medicaid Act."  Quoting the court's decision in Beal v. Doe, 432
U.S. 438, 444 (1992), the petitioners maintained that "[n]othing
in Title XIX requires participating states to fund every
procedure that falls within the delineated categories of medical
care."

     The petitioners added that the Eighth Circuit decision is
irreconcilable with a line of cases, including Zbaraz v. Quern,
596 F.2d 196 (7th Cir. 1979) and Preterm, Inc. v. Dukakis, 591
F.2d 121 (1st Cir. 1979), which recognize a state's discretion to
construct Medicaid plans to suit their own circumstances.

     The petitioners also advanced the argument that the court in
Harris "implicitly rejected the contention that the Hyde
Amendment substantively amended Title XIX."

     Finally, the petitioners asserted that the supremacy clause
does not give the respondents the right, under 42 U.S.C. Section
1983, to nullify a state law.

     "Section 1983 was not intended to give a cause of action to
individuals where the only "wrong" committed by a state is
misapprehending the precise location of the boundaries between
state and federal power," the petitioners said.

     Representing Orr were Simon Heller and Janet Benshoof of the
Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, New York City, and
Lawrence I. Batt of Batt & Associates, Omaha, NE.

MAINE MEDICAID PROGRAM AGREES TO LOOSEN NUTRITION SUPPLEMENT
REQUIREMENTS

     Avoiding the progression of a legal battle to the First
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, the Maine Department of Human
Services on Nov. 14 agreed to expand its state Medicaid coverage
to include liquid dietary supplements for clinically malnourished
AIDS patients who do not yet use a feeding tube.  Fisher et al.
v. Sheehan (previously, Hines v. Sheehan), No. 94-326-P-H (D ME).

     In September, the attorney for now-deceased plaintiff
Raymond Hines filed a notice of appeal with the First Circuit,
challenging U.S. District Judge D. Brock Hornby's July ruling
affirming the Maine Medicaid rule governing supplement coverage.
Hines was previously denied Medicaid coverage for supplements he
was taking.

     The trial judge said that although the state failed "even to
articulate a plausible reason" for limiting liquid dietary
supplement coverage only to persons with end stage renal disease
while denying coverage for those diagnosed as clinically
malnourished, such a requirement could not be found to violate
the Americans With Disabilities Act, the federal Medicaid Statute
and regulations (42 U.S.C. Sections1396, 1396r-8; 42 C.F.R.
Section 440.230[c]), or the U.S. Constitution's equal protection
clause.

     Under a stipulation of dismissal filed with the First
Circuit by both parties, the Department has agreed to amend its
Maine Medical Assistance Manual to provide coverage of liquid
nutrition to Medicaid recipients who are: "A) Currently
malnourished...; and B) At significant risk for malnourishment
secondary to an underlying medical condition...."

     The Department was instructed to propose such amendments to
current rules by Dec. 31, 1995, and to "promptly identify any
current Medicaid recipients who have a request pending (including
any pending appeals) for coverage of liquid nutrition.  The
state, which did not admit to any liability in entering the
agreement, will pay $4,105 in legal costs and filing fees and pay
substitute plaintiff William Herbert Fisher $300.

     Hines was represented by Jack Comart of Pine Tree Legal
Assistance, Inc.  Andrew M. Gattine of the Maine Department of
the Attorney General represented the state.

9TH CIRCUIT REFUSES REHEARING ON ABORTION RECUSAL ISSUE

     The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Nov. 27 rejected
the suggestion for a rehearing en banc in the matter of a judge's
refusal to recuse himself from an appeal of two abortion protest
convictions.  Feminist Women's Health Center et al. v. Codispoti
et al., No. 90-35266 (9th Cir.)

     The panel members had polled all active judges of the
circuit, and none requested a vote on whether to rehear the
matter en banc.

     The plaintiffs, in their Nov. 21 motion for rehearing,
asserted the importance of the question of "whether a judge
should recuse himself in a case concerning the rights of those
who provide abortions, who has written that Catholic judges
should ignore controlling judicial precedent if following
precedent would support abortions and who has also expressed
hostility in his writings toward the providers of abortions."

     The plaintiffs said that in denying their earlier motion for
recusal, Judge John T. Noonan Jr. incorrectly construed the issue
to be his membership in the Catholic church.  Rather, the
plaintiffs contended that the issue was whether a judge, based on
his specific writings, "can follow his judicial oath rather than
his published views."

     The plaintiffs opened their clinic (the Center) in Everett,
WA, in 1983.  The named defendants began protesting at the site
before the opening of business and engaged in harassing tactics
during the eight months the center operated in Everett.

     Beyond pickets and harassing phone calls, the clinic was set
on fire on three separate occasions; after the last and most
severe fire, the plaintiffs opted not to reopen.  Co-defendant
Curtis Beseda was subsequently convicted for setting the fires.

     The plaintiffs had sued in state court to obtain an
injunction against the protesters.  (The third clinic fire had
been set in the midst of the April 1994 trial.)  The state trial
judge granted an injunction barring the defendants from engaging
in illegal conduct; the order proved ultimately unnecessary, as
the Center never reopened.

     In 1986, the plaintiffs then brought the instant suit under
Sections1962(c)-(d) in the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Washington, alleging predicate acts of arson and
Hobbs Act extortion.  The jury concluded that Beseda had violated
Section 1962(c), and that Beseda, Dottie Roberts and Sharon
Codispoti conspired to commit the substantive violation.  The
court divided the attorney's fees equally among the defendants.

     Roberts and Codispoti argued on appeal that the plaintiffs
could have raised the RICO allegations in their state court
action; the Ninth Circuit agreed in reversing the judgment.  "We
conclude that the RICO claims were ripe at the time the state
court judgment was filed, and therefore, the Center could have
brought them in the earlier trial," the panel wrote.

      The trial court had rejected the defense's res judicata
arguments, concluding that the RICO claims were based on
different infringements of the plaintiff's rights and sought
different redress, and that the RICO claims were not mature at
the time of the state trial because the plaintiffs had not yet
decided not to reopen.

     However, the Ninth Circuit panel, by decision dated Aug. 27,
held that the appellants satisfied the four requisite elements
for res judicata.  The panel ruled that both lawsuits concerned
identical subject matter, parties and "quality of the persons for
or against whom the claim is made."  The panel also determined
that the two suits concerned the same cause of action after
concluding, in an admittedly closer call, that the suits involved
infringement of the same right.

     "In essence, the Center is merely seeking remedies under a
new legal theory: treble damages under RICO for the same conduct
on behalf of appellants," the panel wrote.  "This does not
establish an independent cause of action."  The panel reversed
the decision of the district court on that basis.

     Judge Noonan, a member of the panel, denied the plaintiff's
motion for recusal Nov. 7, pointing to the provision of
Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, which holds that "no
religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any
Office or public trust under the United States."

     Representing the plaintiffs were Kristin Houser of
Schroeter, Goldmark & Bender and William J. Bender of Skellenger,
Bender, Mathias & Bender, both of Seattle.

PETITION SEEKS ANSWER ON STANDARD FOR CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES

     South Dakota's governor and attorney general on Nov. 29
filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme
Court, maintaining that the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
erred in striking down South Dakota's one-parent notification
requirement for minors seeking abortions.  Janklow et al. v.
Planned Parenthood et al., No. 95-856 (U.S.).

     The petitioners assert that granting the writ will resolve
the disagreement among the circuits on the precedent to follow in
challenges to the constitutionality of abortion statutes.

     In striking down South Dakota's parental notification
requirements, the Eighth Circuit panel applied the "undue burden"
standard for determining the facial constitutionality of an
abortion law set forth in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
Pennsylvania v. Casey, 112 S.Ct. 2791 (1992).  The court in Casey
held that an abortion law is unconstitutional if it operates as a
substantial obstacle to the choice to undergo an abortion "in a
large fraction of cases in which [it] is relevant, ...[i]t is an
undue burden, and is therefore invalid."

     Prior to Casey, the applicable precedent was the strict
burden placed on challengers to constitutionality enunciated in
United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1979) ("the challenger
must establish that no set of circumstances exist under which the
Act would be valid").

               The petitioners note that the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals, in Barnes v. Moore, 970 F.2d 12 (1992), explicitly
refused to interpret Casey as overruling Salerno.

     The petitioners also note that granting the writ would allow
the Supreme Court to decide the important question of whether a
judicial bypass is required in a single-parent notice statute.
The court, in Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497
U.S. 502, 510 (1990), said that the question of the need for
bypass procedures in parental notification statutes has not been
decided, noted the petitioners.  Answering this question, say the
petitioners, would allow state legislatures "[t]o function
properly in an area which touches on constitutional rights."

     The petitioners also argue that the Eighth Circuit panel's
decision disregards the "rational relationship" test for notice
statutes subscribed to by a court majority in Hodgson v.
Minnesota, 497 U.S. 417 (1990).  In Hodgson, the court examined a
two-parent notification statute in terms of its "rational
relationship" with legitimate state interests.

     Finally, even if the undue burden standard of Casey is
adjudged to be applicable, the petitioners maintain that the
notice requirement does not place an undue burden on minors
seeking abortions.  First, the statute gives no veto power to
parents, say the petitioners.

     Second, the petitioners argue that the Eighth Circuit panel
erred in (1) "treating South Dakota's one-parent notice statute
as equivalent to a two-parent statute"; and (2) "extend[ing] the
rationale of Casey for striking down spousal notice to the issue
of one-parent notice with regard to 'mature minors.'"

     Third, South Dakota's exception to the notice requirement
for minors who are abused by their parents "provides better
protections for abuse victims than are available in judicial
bypass states," argue the petitioners.

     Fourth, the petitioners take the stance that the struck-down
statute would "maintain the confidentiality of the abortion
requested."

     Last, there was no evidence before the Eighth Circuit panel
supporting "the existence of a large fraction of minors who would
be unduly burdened by [the] South Dakota parental notice
statute," the petitioners say.

     The instant controversy arose when the U.S. District Court
for the District of South Dakota ruled that the parental
notification provision of South Dakota's abortion law was
unconstitutional because it did not allow for mature minors or
for those immature minors whose "best interests" do not include
parental involvement to bypass the requirement.

               In affirming the district court's decision, the Eighth
Circuit panel held that the state had no legitimate interest in
"placing a substantial obstacle" in the path of these categories
of minors when they seek "pre-viability" abortions.  The law's
exception to the notification requirement for abused or neglected
minors did not adequately bypass the notification requirement
because it did not protect the minor's confidentiality, said the
panel.  Additionally, the panel observed that the exception did
not provide access to an independent decisionmaker for a
determination on the minor's maturity and on whether it was in
the minor's "best interests" to involve a parent.

     South Dakota's abortion law, enacted in 1993, prohibited,
with some exceptions, the performance of abortions on
unemancipated minors prior to 48 hours after written notice was
delivered to at least one parent.

     Representing the petitioners are Mark W. Barnett, Attorney
General, State of South Dakota; and John P. Guhin and Janine
Kern, Deputy Attorneys General, Pierre, SD.

6TH CIR. FINDS EXCESS INSURER LIABLE FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES

     An excess insurer is liable for $128,232 in medical expenses
incurred by a dependent covered by an employer's self-funded
medical benefit plan, the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
ruled Nov. 29, rejecting the insurer's interpretation of the
contract provision governing coverage for disabled beneficiaries.
Thorn Apple Valley Inc. v. Allianz Life Insurance Co. of North
America, No. 94-1841 (6th Cir.).

     Thorn Apple Valley sponsored and administered a self-funded
benefit plan for its employees.  Under an excess risk policy,
Allianz Life Insurance Co. was obligated to provide coverage
above a $200,000 deductible or attachment point for 1987 and a
$75,000 deductible for 1988.  An employee's husband, Ralph
Hoffer, was added as a dependent in 1981.  Their marriage
certificate described him as "unemployed-handicapped" because he
was blind due to insulin-dependent brittle diabetes mellitus.  He
enjoyed activities in and outside their home until late 1987,
when he was hospitalized for end-stage kidney disease.  Hoffer
died in 1988 in the hospital.

     Thorn Apple was billed about $650,000 for Hoffer's medical
expenses and notified Allianz it planned to file a claim under
the excess risk policy.  Thorn Apple then decided Hoffer was
ineligible for benefits because the plan excluded dependents who
are "in a disabled condition" when they initially become eligible
for coverage.  Thorn Apple then reversed its position, deciding
Hoffer was covered, but Allianz denied liability.

     A diversity-based complaint was filed in U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Michigan.  After a bench trial, Judge
Lawrence P. Zatkoff ruled that Hoffer was not disabled within the
meaning of the policy, ordered Allianz to reimburse $128,232 to
Thorn Apple and awarded post-judgment interest under federal and
state law.

     The Sixth Circuit affirmed the award but modified by
allowing only federal, not state, post-judgment interest in an
opinion by Judge James L. Ryan.  The panel found Hoffer eligible
for benefits because he was not in a "disabled condition" when
first covered by the plan, despite blindness and diabetes.  The
unambiguous language of the plan provides that a person is
disabled only if confined by illness or injury in a hospital,
institution or at home and if unable to carry on any substantial
part of customary activities for someone of a similar age and
gender.  Hoffer did not fit that definition, the panel held.

     Next, the panel found no error in admission of hospital
bills as business records.

     Finally, the panel held that Judge Zatkoff had improperly
awarded both federal and state post-judgment interest, thus
creating an impermissible double recovery.  Although it was a
diversity-based action, only the federal statutory interest
provision applies, the panel found.

4TH CIR.: INSURER MUST REVIEW DENIAL OF 'OUTSIDE SERVICE AREA'
COVERAGE

     A trial judge must have an adequate administrative record
when reviewing the discretion of a health plan administrator
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, even when the
plan gives the administrator sole authority to determine the
eligibility of beneficiaries under the plan, the Fourth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Dec. 4.  Bernstein v. CapitalCare
Inc., No. 94-2448 (4th Cir.).

     Philip Bernstein filed suit to recover the medical expenses
his late brother Jeffrey Bernstein incurred for treatment of AIDS
while the brother was in New York and outside the area covered by
CapitalCare, a health maintenance organization.  The plan said it
would not cover treatment outside the Washington, DC, area if the
need for such treatment was foreseeable.

     "Whether [the brother's] need for care was reasonably
foreseeable is a factual determination that must be supported by
competent medical evidence" that was not before the court when it
made its ruling, the panel said.  The panel said the
administrative record developed by CapitalCare before it
rejected the claim was so skimpy that the trial court had to rely
on facts not before it.

     Because the court had to review CapitalCare's decision under
an abuse of discretion standard since the plan gave it sole
discretion to determine eligibility for benefits, "the
administrative record must document the decision-making process.
If the evidence before the plan administrator is inadequate, the
district court should remand the case to the administrator to
receive additional evidence and to make a new determination."

     The panel further emphasized that the deference the trial
judge should accord the decision depends on how much of a
conflict the administrator has.  In this case, "Capital Care
operates under a conflict of interest when it makes benefit
determinations, because it both administers the plan and pays for
benefits received by its members.  In other words, if CapitalCare
denies health benefits to its members, it generally profits by
the amount of expenses avoided."

     Bernstein's estate is represented by Richard Carter and
Jacqueline Bennett of Hudgins Carter & Coleman in Alexandria, VA.
Charles Steele and Mary Atchley Jester of Foley & Lardner in
Washington, DC represent CapitalCare.

NEW ENGLAND INSURER TARGETED FOR UNLAWFUL DISCOUNTS

     A class action was filed against United Health Plans of New
England in U.S. District Court in Boston Dec. 5, alleging
deception in the secret negotiation of discounts with hospitals
and health care providers and the failure to pass those discounts
on to the insureds.  Powers et ux. v. United Health Plans of New
England, No. 95-12633 (D MA).

     The suit maintains that this practice caused insureds to
overpay their required copayment for medical procedures.

     Lead plaintiffs Lisa and Patrick Powers, who are insured by
United Health Plans of New England, brought suit on their behalf
and on behalf of class members insured from Jan. 1, 1990, through
Dec. 31, 1995.

     The Powerses purchased health care insurance from United for
the period from March 1993 through Oct. 1, 1994.  Lisa Powers
underwent a Caesarean section on Aug. 9, 1994, for which she was
billed $3,900 by her physician.  The insurance agreement with
United required that the insured pay 30% of the charges and the
Powerses paid the physician $1,170.  The plaintiffs were unaware
of the pre-existing fee arrangement United had negotiated with
the physician, whereby he had agreed to a total payment of
$2,100.  United paid the difference between what the plaintiffs
had paid and the secret fee schedule the physician had accepted,
resulting in United's paying $930 " 44% of the total rather than
the 70% provided for in the contract.

     The plaintiffs allege that as a result of United's unfair
and deceptive acts, they and the class paid more than the 30%
copayments they were obligated to pay according to their
contracts.  Plaintiffs allege violations of ERISA Section
502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. Section 1132(a)(1)(B), claims for
benefits; ERISA Section 409(a), 29 U.S.C. Sections1109(a) and
1106(b), breach of fiduciary duty; breach of contract; deceit and
misrepresentation; and unjust enrichment.  Plaintiffs also seek a
declaratory judgment and an accounting.

     The suit alleges that United breached its fiduciary duty to
class members by negotiating discounts with hospitals and health
care providers that applied only to United's portion of the
charges and did not benefit the class members.  Thus, class
members paid amounts in excess of what they were contractually
obligated to pay and United retained the difference, violating
the terms of its own agreements.

     The suit further claims that United has recorded payments
against certain class members' lifetime, annual or procedure
maximums, in excess of what United actually paid, resulting in
restriction of benefits to which certain class members should be
entitled.  In keeping the discounts secret, United allegedly
misled class members and hid the fact that it was using its
fiduciary position for its own exclusive benefit.  As a result of
United's breaches of fiduciary duty, class members ended up
paying millions of dollars more in health care costs than they
were contractually obligated to pay.

     The plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment, pursuant to
ERISA Section 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. Section 1132(a)(1)(B), as
to their entitlement to benefits of discounts negotiated and
obtained by United.  They also seek certification of class
status, an accounting for damages and economic harm allegedly
caused by United, award of damages for overpayment of insurance
copayments, award of prejudgment, and post-judgment interest, and
award of reasonable attorneys' fees.

     The plaintiffs are represented by Norman Berman, Glen
DeValerio and Jeffrey C. Block of Berman, DeValerio & Pease in
Boston.

AR BLUE CROSS ACCUSED OF CHEATING POLICYHOLDERS OUT OF DISCOUNTS

     Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield is cheating policy
holders by not passing along discounts it negotiates with
hospitals, clinics and other health care providers, contend two
policyholders in a class action filed Nov. 15 in federal court in
Little Rock.  Hause et al. v. Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue
Shield, No. LR-C-95-729 (ED AR).

     The suit contends that policyholders and others covered
under plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 are forced to pay disproportionate shares of hospital
costs because the mutual insurance company negotiates discounts
for itself but not for policyholders.  As a result, the suit
contends, policyholders pay their copayment share on the basis of
the full hospital bill while the company pays only a discounted
share of the bill.

     Among other allegations, the plaintiffs assert the company
violates the civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as ERISA and its fiduciary
duties.  The plaintiffs also contend the company was guilty of
misrepresentation to policyholders and concealed "its tortious,
contract-breaching, statutorily prohibited, inequitable conduct
from the class," which is defined as "all individuals who are or
were participants, insureds/certificate holders under sickness
and accident benefit plans maintained by an employer or employee
organization constituting employee welfare benefit plans covered
by ERISA (within the meaning of ERISA Section 3(1) and 4,
29 U.S.C. Sections 1002(1) and 1003), which plans were written,
underwritten or administered" by the company.

     The suit asserts that under a typical plan, the company
would cover 80% of the costs, and the policyholder would pay 20%.
The plaintiffs allege that the company would negotiate discounts
with hospitals and clinics but that the discounts would not apply
to the insureds' copayments, meaning that policyholders would pay
the full 20% of the total bill, but the company would pay only
80% of the negotiated, discounted portion it covered.  This had
the effect of increasing the burden on the policyholders beyond
the 20% they were obliged to pay, the suit contends.

     The plaintiffs allege that similar systems are used in at
least 13 other states and the District of Columbia.  However,
they are not seeking to represent possible class members.

     Arkansas Blue Cross breached its fiduciary duties, assert
the plaintiffs, because it negotiated discounts for itself but
not the beneficiaries; as a result, it paid less than the
proportion of the actual bill it contracted to pay.  The suit
also contends that the company kept the discounts secret from the
beneficiaries, and recorded the shares paid by beneficiaries
against their "lifetime maximums or procedure maximums in excess
of what Arkansas Blue Cross paid."

     The plaintiffs further allege that the company violated the
RICO Act by receiving "income derived directly or indirectly from
a pattern of racketeering activity."

     The suit asks the court to declare a class action as soon as
possible, award compensatory damages based on the alleged
overpayments by policyholders because of the discounts, triple
damages under the RICO allegation, prejudgment interest, a full
accounting of the unwarranted profits and disgorgement of those
profits, and an injunction requiring the company to disclose the
discounts and pass along the benefits to the beneficiaries.

     The plaintiffs are represented by David S. Mitchell of the
Little Rock firm of McHenry and Mitchell and by Jay Youngdahl of
the firm of Youngdahl and Sadin of Albuquerque.

U.S. SUP. CT. DENIES REVIEW OF HMO VICARIOUS LIABILITY CLAIM

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 4 denied the petition of a
health maintenance organization seeking preemption of the
vicarious malpractice claim filed against it by two of its
subscribers.  U.S. Healthcare, Inc. et al. v. Dukes et al.,
No. 95-442 (U.S.).

     In its Sept. 15 petition for writ of certiorari, U.S.
Healthcare, Inc. (USHC) asserted that a panel of the Third
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals erred in remanding the plaintiffs'
vicarious malpractice action against it to state court.  USHC
argued that removal to federal court was required under the
complete preemption doctrine of the Employee Retirement and
Income Security Act.

     In their Oct. 11 response brief, the respondents argued that
remand to state court was proper because their complaint was
based on only state law negligence, malpractice and agency
theories.

     The litigation arose after the deaths of two individuals
being cared for by USHC network providers.  One, Darryl Dukes,
died with a highly elevated blood sugar level that allegedly
could have been diagnosed with a timely blood test.  The other
was the stillborn infant daughter of USHC subscriber Linda
Visconti.  Visconti developed symptoms of preeclampsia during
pregnancy, but her obstetrician allegedly did not react to those
symptoms.

     Both plaintiffs brought medical malpractice suits against
the various providers involved.  They also alleged medical
malpractice against USHC under ostensible and/or actual agency
theory.  The actions were removed to federal district court in
Philadelphia on the motion of USHC.

     The district court subsequently dismissed both claims
against on the basis that they were "related to" an ERISA plan
and thus were preempted by ERISA.

     The Third Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of
the claims against USHC and remanded them to state court.  The
panel said that preemption hinged on whether the claims were
filed "to recover benefits due...under the terms of [the] plan,
to enforce...rights under the terms of the plan, or to
clarify...rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan."
The panel ruled that the claims were filed strictly over the
quality of the health care received under the plan and thus fell
into none of these categories.

               Dukes and Visconti were represented by Attarah B. Feenane
and Stephen C. Josel of Stephen C. Josel and Associates, P.C.,
Philadelphia.  U.S. Healthcare was represented by John T. Kelley
of Kelley, Wardel & Craig, Haddonfield, NJ, and David F. Simon of
its corporate legal staff.

PETITIONER SAYS ERISA AUTHORIZES INJUNCTIONS OF STATE COURT
ACTIONS

     An employee welfare plan fiduciary in a Nov. 27 petition for
writ of certiorari claimed that the courts below erred in
declining to enjoin the Commonwealth of Virginia from subjecting
the plan to its statutory and regulatory requirements.  Employers
Resource Management Co., Inc. et al. v. Shannon et al., No. 95-
823 (U.S.).

     In its brief in opposition filed Dec. 19, the Commonwealth
argued that the petitioners' stance "would place state insurance
regulations into turmoil, and would effectively jettison
fundamental principles of federalism and comity."

     Employers Resource Management Co. (ERM) provides "co-
employment" services to client employers in 13 states.  As part
of its agreements with the client employers, ERM assumes
responsibility for employee payroll and benefits in return for
control over employee training, performance, discipline and other
areas.  ERM maintains an employee benefit plan that provides
medical, dental, accidental death and dismemberment, and
occupational injury benefits and others for its "co-employees."

     The Commonwealth of Virginia, through its State Corporation
Commission and Commissioner of Insurance, notified ERM that it
intended to move to enjoin ERM from operating in Virginia on the
basis that ERM's benefit plan was a multiemployer welfare
arrangement (MEWA) subject to Virginia's insurance laws and
regulations.  ERM had apparently failed to obtain the license to
operate required by the Commonwealth.  ERM filed its own suit in
federal district court, seeking to enjoin the Commonwealth from
taking that action.  In its action, ERM argued that its plan was
an employee welfare benefit plan under ERISA and was not a MEWA.
ERM contended that the federal courts had the jurisdiction to
enjoin any state action in violation of ERISA.

     The Commonwealth responded to ERM's action with a motion to
dismiss, arguing that (1) the injunctive relief sought by ERM was
barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. Section 2283;
(2) the district court must abstain, pursuant to Younger v.
Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), from exercising its jurisdiction; and
(3) ERM's plan was a MEWA subject to its laws and regulations.

     On Nov. 22, 1994, the district court granted the
Commonwealth's motion to dismiss.  While it did not reach the
merits of ERM's argument that its employee benefit plan is an
ERISA plan, the district court did rule that ERM did not make a
"facially conclusive" ERISA preemption claim.  It also ruled that
ERM's claim for injunctive and declaratory relief was barred by
the Younger abstention doctrine.

     That decision was affirmed by a panel of the Fourth Circuit
U.S. Court of Appeals on Sept. 19, 1995.  The Fourth Circuit
panel said that "[w]hile we appreciate that Congress intended for
ERISA to operate primarily in the federal sphere, we do not
believe that ERISA created the type of 'unique' federal right or
remedy [that qualifies as an exception to the Anti-Injunction
Act]."  The panel also rejected ERM's claim that "extraordinary
circumstances" existed warranting bypass of the Younger
abstention doctrine.

     In its petition for writ of certiorari, ERM pointed to a
conflict among the circuits as to "whether ERISA is a statute in
which Congress has 'expressly authorized' the federal courts to
enjoin state court proceedings within the meaning of the Anti-
Injunction Act."  ERM cited as an example the decision in General
Motors Corp. v. Buha, 623 F.2d 455 (1980), wherein the Sixth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals concluded that federal courts were
not barred from enjoining state court proceedings violating
ERISA's preemption provisions.  U.S. Supreme Court review could
resolve this conflict, said ERM.

     Also subject to resolution, said ERM, is the apparent
conflict among earlier U.S. Supreme Court decisions on the
question of "whether federal courts have the power under the
Anti-Injunction Act to enjoin state court proceedings involving
matters over which Congress has conferred exclusive jurisdiction
upon the federal courts."  ERM cited to Capital Service, Inc. et
al. v. NLRB, 347 U.S. 501 (1954), as teaching that federal
agencies with exclusive jurisdiction over a class of claims may
enjoin state actions that tend to invade that jurisdiction.  On
the other side, ERM cited to the lead opinion in Vendo Co. v.
Lektro-Vend Corp., 433 U.S. 623 (1977), wherein exclusive
jurisdiction under the Clayton Act did not support a stay in
state court proceedings.

     Finally, ERM asserted that the district court erred in
finding abstention mandated under Younger.  In its petition, ERM
stated, "ERISA, among all of the federal statutes, makes one of
the most compelling cases for federal courts to refuse to abstain
on Younger grounds.  ERISA preemption is a class of 'field
preemption' which has been categorized as 'super preemption,'
displacing virtually all state laws from the field of employee
benefit plans, even state laws which are fully consonant with
ERISA.  Congress has coupled ERISA's expansive preemption with a
grant to the federal courts of exclusive jurisdiction over
equitable suits to enjoin violations of ERISA or enforce its
provisions, which, in effect, is a manifestation of Congress'
intention to have preemption claims resolved by federal courts
rather than the state courts."
               In its brief in opposition, the Commonwealth argued that the
petitioners incorrectly contended "that ERISA's preemptive effect
wholly deprives state courts of the ability to determine their
own jurisdiction in an area expressly left to the states by
Congress in the McCarran-Ferguson Act."

     The Commonwealth said that the federal courts "should not
interfere with the state enforcement proceedings pending in the
Virginia court, which [is] fully capable of determining, and
which should determine, both ERM's status as a MEWA under
Virginia law and whether such proceedings had been preempted by
Congress under ERISA."  As a result, it maintained that the
district court and the Fourth Circuit panel correctly ruled that
the Anti-Injunction Act and the Younger abstention principles
compelled them to avoid interfering with the state proceedings.

     Finally, the Commonwealth argued that ERISA does not meet
the two-prong test for an "expressly authorized" exception to the
Anti-Injunction Act as specified in Mitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S.
225, 238 (1972).  ERISA does not "create the type of uniquely
federal right considered in Mitchum," said the Commonwealth, nor
does it "expressly authorize or its legislative history
contemplate injunctions against state court proceedings."

6TH CIRCUIT: CARDIAC SURGEON FAILED TO SHOW CONCERTED ACTION

     The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in an unpublished
Nov. 22 decision upheld summary judgment against a cardiac
surgeon who filed a Sherman Act complaint against a hospital and
a number of cardiologists.  Schwartz et al. v. Aultman Health
Services Association d/b/a Aultman Hospital et al., No. 94-3967
(6th Cir.).

     The court found insufficient evidence to support claims of
conspiracy and monopoly stemming from the physicians' refusal to
refer patients to him for surgery.

     Richard Schwartz, a cardiothoracic surgeon, had privileges
at Aultman Hospital.  He failed the thoracic surgery board exam
three times, then stopped performing cardiac surgery from 1990 to
1992.  After he decided to resume surgery, Aultman Hospital
required him to undergo further training before granting
temporary privileges.  Even when his privileges were restored,
the defendant cardiologists allegedly did not refer patients to
him.

     Schwartz's Sherman Act complaint in the Northern District of
Ohio alleged a conspiracy among the cardiologists and hospital to
restrain trade and a monopoly or attempted monopoly of the
relevant market for cardiac surgery.  Judge Ann Aldrich granted a
defense motion for summary judgment.

     Affirming in a per curiam opinion, the Sixth Circuit stated
that there was no direct evidence of a conspiracy, nor was there
circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy in restraint of trade.
None of the defendants competed with Schwartz for cardiac surgery
cases, and Aultman Hospital, in fact, lost revenue when patients
were sent to surgeons elsewhere.  It also said the purported
conspiracy makes no practical sense and noted the cardiologists
received no referral fee and, therefore, had no financial reason
to prefer other surgeons over Schwartz.

     The court rejected the monopolization claim due to the lack
of evidence of concerted action.  It said there was no attempted
monopolization because the defendants were not Schwartz's
competitors and were not motivated by incentives that would show
an intent to monopolize or to destroy competition.  Nor was there
data defining a relevant geographic market to support his claim
for actual monopolization, it said.

DISCOVERY CONTINUES IN PRIVACY SUIT AGAINST INDIANA HOSPITAL

     A July 1996 trial date is set in an HIV-positive man's
confidentiality suit against an Evansville, IN, hospital where he
claims the failure of emergency room personnel to use universal
precautions in treating him resulted in the disclosure of his HIV
status to others and the loss of his job when his employer heard
the news.  Conway v. St. Mary's Medical Center et al., No. 82D03-
9503-CT-637 (IN Super. Ct., Vanderburgh Cty).

     Although an Americans With Disabilities Act-based suit over
plaintiff Larry Conway's firing from an Evansville restaurant
settled in October for $25,000, his personal suit against St.
Mary's Medical Center and two nurses there continues and is now
in discovery.

     Conway says that because of emergency room nurse Donna
Elder's failure to use proper precautions in treating the hand he
cut severely while at work in 1993, he warned her of his HIV
status and she refused to provide him with continued treatment.
His suit alleges that he was sent to a patient waiting room where
nursing supervisor Robin Zeibell soon told him, in earshot of
others, that he would have to submit to HIV and hepatitis B
testing before he could be treated.  Because of his need for
immediate medical attention, Conway says he submitted to the
tests.

               The suit says because Conway's HIV infection was noted on
his medical chart, "one or more" St. Mary's employees observed
the entry and told him that a copy of the record would be sent to
his employer, "The Pub" restaurant.  Upon learning of his HIV
status, the restaurant effectively terminated Conway by failing
to schedule him for work hours.

     Conway's suit says St. Mary's was negligent in the hiring,
training and retention of Elder and Zeibell, and that the
plaintiff's privacy rights were violated under the Indiana
Communicable Disease Confidentiality Law (IN Code 16-41-8-1).

     The hospital has denied violating Conway's privacy rights
and failed in an attempt to have the case reviewed by a medical
review panel under the claim that the complaint sounded in
medical malpractice.

     Conway is represented by Paul Chase and Sandra Gosling of
the Indiana HIV Advocacy Program and John Jay Boyce of Legal
Services Organization of Indiana's HIV/AIDS Legal Project.  All
are located in Indianapolis.  Patrick A. Shoulders of Ziemer,
Stayman, Weitzel & Shoulders in Evansville represents the
defendants.
