<h1>Frisco, Colorado Supports Medical Marijuana </h1>

<p> From a posting by NORML </p>

<p> On July 5, 1994 after hearing 2 hours of testimony from a
sympathetic and supportive crowd, the Frisco Town Council
unanimously passed a resolution urging the state of Colorado to
&quot;reactivate the research program on the use and dispensing
of marijuana for medical purposes.&quot; </p>

<p> </p>

<p> The resolution goes on to say, &quot;Whereas, upon the
legislative report of findings establishing the effective use of
marijuana as a therapeutic drug, the Town of Frisco strongly
encourages the State of Colorado and the federal government to
legalize the dispensing of marijuana for medical purposes
pursuant to federal and state guidelines.&quot; </p>

<p> </p>

<p> Frisco is the second town in Colorado to publicly address the
ban on medical access to marijuana. In April, residents of
Breckenridge voted 261-213 in favor of an ordinance ordering the
police chief and district attorney to make the arrest and
prosecution of those using or cultivating marijuana for medical
purposes their lowest priority. <br>
