Korea: Firms Select 9,044 Capital Goods Related Items for Localization

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Conglomerates Discuss Import Cutbacks With FKI

The 30 largest business groups (chaebol) and other large business
enterprises reportedly have decided to go ahead with a plan to
localize capital goods-related items.

The decision came at a meeting of the chairman and vice-chairmen of
the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), one of the largest
businessmen's association in Korea, on September 18.

Through repeated consultations and readjustments among business
circles and by the goods office of the federation, 78 subsidiary firms
of 24 business groups have selected a total of 9,044 capital
goods-related items for localization schedules.

Of the total items, components topped the list with 8,562, followed by
machinery and equipment with 373 and advanced raw materials with 109,
sources at the federation said.

If the localization schedules are carried out successfully, import
substitution would reach 8 trillion won by 2000, along with huge
tangible and intangible indirect effects, the sources predicted.

Under the implementation program worked out by the federation, the
localization projects are estimated to cost about 2.8 trillion won, of
which 1.5 trillion won will be covered with internal funds and the
rest with borrowings from banks and rights offerings, the sources
explained.

To help raise sufficient funds by private enterprises, the government
needs to allow private enterprises to induce foreign cash loans, the
sources said.

Moreover, the business community is calling on the government to
extend varied financial supporting measures and to ease its
restrictions in a bid to help facilitate localization projects of
private enterprises, the sources disclosed.

Despite worsening economic situations at home, largest business groups
and private enterprises are bent on localizing capital goods-related
items, the sources said.

For instance, the Samsung business group plans to pour 500 billion won
by 2000 into localization of eight items, including laser processing
devices and automatic equipment and systems.  If these items are
localized, the group would be able to conserve about 1.16 trillion won
between 1996 and 2000 by replacing imports, group sources said.

The Hyundai business group intends to develop 6,521 items, including
turbo chargers for diesel engines and knock-sensors for passenger
cars. For localization projects, the group will invest 660 billion won
for the next five years, and it wants to conserve about 3.9 billion
won by replacing imports.

The LG business group reportedly is trying to develop 73 items with
its investment reaching 23.4 billion won through 2000 to attain import
substitution totaling about 300 billion won.

The Daewoo business group hopes to undertake 10 research themes, with
its investments in the heavy industries sector reaching 60 billion
won, those in the automobile sector amounting to 103 billion won and
those in the communications sector with 34 billion won, all by 2000.

The Sunkyong group plans to develop 68 items, including 33 quality-
and function-improvement items, cooling towers, pressure gauges and
the like.

The Ssangyong group is expected to develop 65 items with a total
investment of 258.6 billion won in collaboration with its
subcontractor firms.

The Kia group will undertake research and development of 1,321
research themes by 2001, such as those concerning automatic
transmission gears, with a total investment of 623 billion won,
including 44.3 billion won in its own fund.   If these items are
developed, the group would be able to conserve about 700 billion won
by replacing imports.

POSCO (Pohang Iron & Steel Co.) reportedly is trying to develop 661
items, including those related to the manufacture of refractory
bricks, rolls and machinery components by 2000, with a total
investment of 52.3 billion won.

The Hanjin group is pushing ahead with a plan to develop 14 items,
including key items for shipbuilding and rolling stocks, with a total
investment of 8.4 billion won.

The Hanwha group is moving to develop six items, including hub units
and bearings, by 1998 with a total investment of 76 billion won, in
collaboration of its subcontractor firms.

Bank of Korea Reports Potential Growth Rate Drops to 6% Range

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Potential rate of growth has dipped to the six-percent level, sources
at the Bank of Korea said.

The central bank announced that potential rate of growth was 6.8
percent for three consecutive quarters from the fourth quarter of 1995
and the second quarter of 1996.

Potential rate of growth was 7.7-8.4 percent between 1980 and 1989,
7.2-7.8 percent between 1990 and 1993, and 7.1-7.2 percent between
1994 and the second quarter of 1995, all maintaining a level of more
than seven percent.

This was the first time that the potential rate of growth dropped to
the six-percent level, sources at the central bank said.

Consequently, it is inevitable for the government to readjust the
foundation for macroeconomic management such as growth, prices and
international balance-of-payments position, the sources said.

The declining trends of the potential rate of growth were ascribed
mainly to the diminishing contribution ratios of capital and labor to
the economic growth deriving from the slow growth rate of fixed
investment and slowdowns in the increase rate of the economically
active population, the sources analyzed.

The central bank's prediction for this year's growth rate is set at
7.2 percent, while the government forecast that the year's growth rate
will hover around 7.0 percent.

This indicates that the year's real growth would slightly surpass the
year's potential rate of growth, the sources explained.

The estimate results of the central bank showed that the potential
rate of growth between 1994 and the second quarter of 1996 was 6.9-7.1
percent.

In view of growing economic scales, the potential rate of growth will
slow gradually, the sources predicted.

As the general view that the business activities peaked in October of
1995, the central bank made its prediction on the potential rate of
growth beginning the fourth quarter of 1995, the sources said.

Amid such declining trends of the potential rate of growth, any
government's overheated business prop-up measures may bring about
adverse effects such as price hikes, the sources said.

Korea: MOTIE Asks for Lower Tariff Rates on Some Imports

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy has asked the Ministry of
Finance and Economy to apply lower import tariff rates for crude oil
and 10 other items in a bid to help exporters strengthen their
competitiveness.

The ministry calls for applying zero-percent tariff rates for three
items--central processing units for computer, raw wool and artificial
corundum--instead of the current 2-8 percent rates, sources at the
ministry said.

The ministry also recommended that the import quota tariff rate on
crude oil should be lowered from the current 5 percent to 3 percent,
for all crude oil imports during the second half of this year, the
sources said.

For the remaining six items, the ministry reportedly is asking that
the current tariff rates should be lowered to 2-4 percent levels, the
sources said.

Korea: MFE Works Out Guidelines for Commercial Loans

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

All small enterprises, including those engaged in business lines other
than manufacturing, will be allowed to induce commercial loans for the
import of plants and equipment, beginning in October this year.

At the same time, all private enterprises, small or large, may be
allowed to introduce foreign loans only for early repayment of foreign
loans they have already obtained, without limits, also beginning in
October this year.

Beginning in January next year, private enterprises participating in
the government-initiated projects such as huge infrastructure projects
to be financed with private capital will be permitted to induce cash
loans of up to $100 million per year for the projects only.

To this effect, a draft revision bill to the guideline for approvals
of commercial loan inducement, worked out by the Ministry of Finance
and Economy, will be put into force step by step, sources at the
ministry said.

Under the draft revision bill, foreign-invested firms which have
equity ownership of more than 50 percent will be allowed to induce
loans for the import of plants and equipment within the framework of
their invested amount here, effective from next year, the sources
said.

As for large enterprises, the introduction of commercial loans will be
allowed only for those big businesses engaged in the high-tech field
in principle, and amounts have yet to be fixed, which will be based on
the foreign exchange market situations during the first quarter of
1997, the sources said.

Until recently, only small enterprises engaged in the manufacturing
industry have been permitted to induce loans for the import of plants
and equipment.

From October this year, however, gas, communications and all other
business lines will be added to the permission list, and no annual
limits would be set if small firms comply with necessary terms and
conditions set by the government for the introduction of loans, the
sources said.

Private enterprises participating in huge infrastructure projects (the
first-grade facility projects such as roads, harbors, airports, etc.)
each involving more than 1 trillion won will be allowed to induce cash
loans each of up to 20 percent of the annual net project cost per
project or up to $100 million, for the projects only, the sources
added.

Korea: Financial Support for Industrial Estates to Greatly Expand

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The government's financial support for industrial estates in
provincial areas will be drastically expanded next year, sources at
the Ministry of Construction and Transportation said.

Beginning in 1997, the government will finance construction of roads
and water-supply systems leading to industrial estates each covering
more than 300,000 pyong (one pyong equals 3.3 square meters) in
provincial districts, the sources said.

At the same time, the loomable amount for the formation of an
industrial estate each covering less than 300,000 pyong in provincial
areas will also be expanded next year far more than this year's level,
the sources explained.

In 1997, a total of 42.5 billion won in the state budget will be
allocated for construction of roads leading to nine industrial estates
in provincial areas, including Chonan, Pyongdong and Naju, the sources
said.

The lending amount for industrial estates each covering less than
300,000 pyong in provincial districts will increase by 20 billion won
to 70 billion won next year, and the loans will be repayable over 10
years in installments after a grace period of five years at an annual
interest rate of 5 percent, the sources said.

These draft budget plans, worked out by the ministry, will be
submitted to the forthcoming National Assembly session after further
consultations with the pertinent ministries, the sources added.

Korea: Five Largest Groups Sell Significantly More Than Others

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

The gap between the nation's top five largest business groups and the
remaining 25 other large business groups reportedly is widening
steadily in terms of turnover.

In the nation's 30 largest business groups, turnover of the top five
business groups showed a whopping increase of 1.6 times over those of
the remaining 25 other business groups in 1994.

This indicates that the top five groups' concentration of economic power
has become more involved, an analysis report of the Korea Development
Institute disclosed.

The share of the 30 largest business groups in the nation's overall
turnover of the manufacturing and mining sector was 39.6 percent in
1994, the report showed.

The share was 34.1 percent in 1977, surpassed the 40-percent level during the
1982-1985 period, dipped to the 35-percent level during the 1987-1989
period and began rising again sharply at the outset of the 1990s, it
said.

In particular, the share of the top five  business groups has become
higher, thus widening the gap between the top-ranking groups and
others.

The share of the top five groups in the nation's overall
manufacturing-mining turnovers in 1977 was 15.7 percent, slightly
lower than 18.4 percent of the 25 other large business groups.

In 1994, the manufacturing-mining share of the top five groups stood
at 24.6 percent, greatly surpassing 15.0 percent of the 25 other
business groups.

The ratio of the top five groups' turnover to overall turnover of the 25
other groups was 22.6 against 17.8 in 1983, and the ratio changed to
21.9 against 14.1 in 1988 and 23.4 against 15.4 in 1991.

This means that the nation's economic power has been heavily
concentrated on the top five business groups, sources at the institute
said.

As a result, the gap between the top five groups' turnover and overall
turnover of the 25 other business groups was 85 percent in 1977, 1.2
times in 1983, 1.5 times in 1991 and 1.6 times in 1994.

In the overall turnover of the 30 largest business groups, the share
of the top five business groups' turnover rose from 46 percent in
1977 to 55.5 percent in 1982 and 62.1 percent in 1994, thus
symbolizing the deepening monopolistic trends of the top five business
groups, the sources said.

Korea: Farm Products Imports Rise by 21% for Several Months

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Imports of farm products in the first seven months of this year
totaled $3.86 billion, up 20.8 percent from a year earlier, sources at
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said.

Imports of farm products from the United States have been increasing
sharply, largely because of the government's import opening policy of
farm products.

Of the seven-month import total, imports from the United States
amounted to $1.76 billion, up 24.7 percent from a year before, taking
the lion's share of 44.7 percent in the seven-month imports, the
sources said.

During the seven-month period, imports of corn from the United States
reached $99.7 million, up 35.5 percent from a year ago, those of
potatoes from the United States showed a rise of 59.6 percent over a
year before, those of grapes rose by 89.6 percent, those of cigarettes
by 44.9 percent, those of tomatoes by 77.4 percent and those of
chocolate by 44.8 percent, the sources said.

Imports of farm products from China during the seven-month period
stood at $309.7 million, up only 13.3 percent from a year earlier, the
sources said.

Korea: Gov't Gives Port Constr. Firms Priority on Auxiliary Projects

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

Private enterprises taking part in private capital-financed new port
construction projects will have priority rights to undertake auxiliary
projects, including construction of a breakwater, dredging and others
to be funded by the government, on a negotiated contract basis.

To help facilitate new port construction projects, a set of various
supporting measures will be sought for local autonomous establishments
and organizations, sources at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and
Fisheries said.

Local residents who will lose fishing grounds due to construction of
new ports will be employed by newly created business lines there on a
priority basis, the sources said.

To this effect, a draft bill governing the promotion of new port
construction, worked out by the ministry, will be submitted to the
forthcoming National Assembly session in October after further
consultations with other government ministries, the sources said.

Under the draft bill, various approval and licensing procedures will
be drastically simplified, the sources said.

At the same time, a promotion council for new port construction,
headed by the deputy premier-finance and economy minister, will be
formed with the heads of provincial governments and local
establishments to deal with basic issues such as designation of
potential areas for new ports, key policy directives, fund supply
programs and the like, the sources said.

If so designated, construction of new ports will benefit from
supporting measures stipulated under the draft bill, and once the
draft bill passes through the National Assembly session, new steps
will be taken for designation of new ports, the sources added.

Korea: Life Insurers Asset Management Yields Drop to 10.7%

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

FINANCE

Life insurance companies' yield on asset management has been dropping
in recent months, affected by the continued bearishness of the local
stock market.

According to life insurance industry sources, for the four month
period from April to July, the nation's 33 life insurers' average
yield on asset management declined to 10.7 percent, a drop of 0.4
percentage point from the corresponding period of 11.1 percent.

In particular, six top life insurers -- Je Il, Samsung, Heungkuk,
Kyobo and Dongah -- saw their combined yield on asset management
scaled back to 10.7 percent during the period, down 0.5 percentage
point from a year earlier.

In contrast, newly established underwriters including Daishin
witnessed a rise in their combined yield on asset management by 0.3
percentage point to 10.7 percent during the April-July period,
outperforming existing larger ones in risky asset management.

Of the big three life insurers, Samsung Life Insurance ranked first on
the yield list for asset management with 11.1 percent involving 858
billion won.

Second was Kyobo Life Insurance with a yield of 11.0 percent, a drop
of 0.6 percentage point from 11.6 percent a year earlier ago. Kyobo
racked up 501.5 billion won in income from asset management.

Korea Life Insurance came in third with 10.5 percent involving 326.8
billion won.

Bank of Korea Reports Bank Lending-Deposit Spreads Increase

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

BANKING

Local banks are expanding lending spreads by raising lending rates
much more than deposit rates, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said.

In a survey on the nation's 30 commercial banks' weighted average
interest rates conducted in July, the central bank said that their
average lending spreads edged up to 2.39 percent, an increase of 0.11
percentage points from the previous month's 2.28 percent.

The reason for this is that commercial banks' average lending rate
surged 0.15 percentage point to annual 11.45 percent in July from the
11.30 percent a month earlier. In contrast, average deposit rates rose
by merely 0.04 percentage point to 9.06 percent from 9.02 percent
during the cited period.

A closer look at the deposit rates by each instrument shows that only
those for time & installment deposits with maturity of three to four
years inched up to 10.57 percent in July from 10.42 percent in June.
Those for free savings deposits rather dropped to 5.67 percent from
5.90 percent, and those for time deposits with maturity of one to two
years skidded to 9.83 percent from 9.85 percent.

When it comes to lending rates, those for overdraft loans rose to
16.13 percent from 14.70 percent on an annual basis during the period.
And those for household loans also edged up to 12.31 percent from
12.17 percent. However those for corporate loans were lowered to 10.85
percent from 11.15 percent.

Samsung Electronics Floats $150 Million in CBs in London

from THE KOREA ECONOMIC DAILY, September 20, 1996

FINANCE

Samsung Electronics Co. (SEC) successfully floated $150 million worth
of overseas convertible bonds (CBs) in London.

The nation's No.1 semiconductor manufacturer said that it had a
signing ceremony to issue $150 million worth of CBs in London on
September 20 with Samsung Securities Co. and SBC Warburg acting as
managing underwriters.

The CBs carry a coupon rate of 0.25 percent, and yield to put (YTP) of
5.8 percent.

Conversion premium was fixed at 25 percent. Given that most overseas
depository receipts (DRs) traded in the international markets have a
premium of 10 to 15 percent, SEC CBs' conversion premium is offered
under more favorable conditions.
