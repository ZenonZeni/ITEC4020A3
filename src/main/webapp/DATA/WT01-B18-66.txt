         <P>Corvallis Disposal is dedicated to the concept and
         practice of environmental preservation. We are constantly
         seeking new technologies and services which will not only
         preserve our environment, but provide more efficient and
         economical collection, recycling, and disposal of waste
         materials.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         By recycling, less energy is required than when using virgin
         resources, both in the initial extraction of resources and
         in manufacturing new products. Recycling conserves valuable
         natural resources and saves millions of dollars of valuable
         materials that would otherwise be buried in landfills. For
         the environment, processing recyclables into new goods
         produces far less air, water and land pollution.<BR>
         
         <BR>
         
         Recycling costs money, but it is still a good investment.
         The revenue derived by selling your recyclable materials
         offsets about 20% of the costs of offering the service.
         These short-termed costs are offset by long-term gains of
         saving resources, energy and landfill space. By changing our
         destructive habits we will begin to sustain a healthier
         environment and preserve our finite resources for future
         generations. This is why Corvallis Disposal has made a
         commitment to recycling. Please become a part of this
         growing endeavor. <NOBR></P>

<H3>Bottle and tub shaped rigid plastic containers only</H3>

<P>Why can we only recycle bottle &amp; tub shaped plastics? The
Garten Foundation in Salem (where we take our plastics), has a new
Plastics Recovery Facility (PRF) which is the first in the world able
to sort plastic bottles and tubs with all seven plastic resin code
numbers. Previously, the only way to recycle plastics was to keep
each resin code number separate from the time it's picked up to the
time it goes to market. This PRF can not only take all 7 resin code
numbers but can take them mingled together! But only if they are
bottle or tub shaped. The system that separates the plastics by resin
code can only "see" these shapes. Bags, trays, etc. are impossible
for this system to sort.</P>

<H3><HR></H3>

<H2><I>Why do I need to sort my recycling?</I></H2>

<H3><I>Separating each commodity in your bin is important because
each commodity needs to go into a separate compartment on our trucks.
When the truck is full, each compartment is emptied into large boxes
at our site and are then hauled to markets where they are recycled.
Our drivers cannot sort everyone's bin because that would require
spending extra time at each stop which would mean we would need to
quadruple (or more) the number of recycling drivers we have! And that
would mean higher rates for our customers.</I><BR>

Corvallis Disposal 's recycling program has experienced strong growth
during the past 5 years, as indicated by this graph:<BR>

<IMG SRC="../frames/images/chart.gif" WIDTH=246 HEIGHT=267
ALIGN=bottom><BR>

The large increase from 1992 to 1993 can be attributed to the start
of mixed paper recycling and curbside yard debris recycling.<HR>
