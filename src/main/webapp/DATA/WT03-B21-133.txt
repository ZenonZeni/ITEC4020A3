				<TD ALIGN=LEFT><B>During 1995, the Musselwhite project in northern Ontario was the subject of a feasibility study, underwent further exploration and was linked to provincial highway 808 by the construction of a 45-kilometre all-weather access road. This resulted in a decision in February 1996 to construct a new gold mine, at an estimated capital cost of $190 million, with production scheduled to commence in the second quarter of 1997. The mine will produce approximately 200,000 ounces of gold per year for 11 years, at an average cash cost of $200 per ounce.</B>

<P>The 9,100-hectare Musselwhite property is located at Opapimiskan Lake, 120 kilometres north of the town of Pickle Lake and 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay.
<P>Proven and probable reserves at Musselwhite are currently estimated to be 10.2 million tonnes averaging 6.9 grams of gold per tonne and containing 2.3 million ounces of gold. There is significant exploration potential to prolong mining beyond the currently planned 11 year mine life.
<P>Musselwhite's gold deposits occur within the Weagamow-North Caribou greenstone belt of the Superior geologic province of the Canadian Shield. Stratabound gold mineralization occurs primarily within a tightly folded iron formation in a volcanic sequence. The main deposits form a series of sub-vertical tabular bodies along the tightly-folded, northwesterly plunging, T-Antiform structure. Numerous exploration targets on the property include the down plunge of the T-Antiform structure and the south iron formation.
<P>The final feasibility study envisages a two stage mining plan for Musselwhite. In the first stage, a decline ramp will be developed to access the ore in the upper levels of the mine with trucks hauling ore to the mill. In later years, a shaft will provide access to the deeper levels and ore will be hoisted to surface. In addition, lower grade ore from a small open pit will be developed early to create an ore stockpile.
<P>The proposed mill will have an estimated capacity of 3,300 tonnes per day and employ conventional gravity separation, cyanide leach and carbon-in-pulp processes. Gold recoveries of 95% are anticipated. Environmental impact and reclamation plans have already been approved by the provincial and federal governments. When it starts operations, the new mine which will be a fly-in, fly-out operation will provide approximately 280 new jobs.
<P>TVX Gold's share of the $15 million 1995 program amounted to $4.8 million.
