EUROPE'S PENSIONS TIME BOMB IS STILL TICKING

RANIERO VANNI, Commissioner for Financial Services, has made good his
threat to withdraw the draft Pension Directive. Vanni had warned last
year that this might be necessary, after the June 1994 Internal Market
Council failed to make any progress towards adoption of the Directive
on Freedom of Management and Investment of Funds held by Institutions
for Retirement Provision.

Instead, the European Commission has issued a Communication on Freedom
of Management and Investment, stressing the "urgent need" to clarify
its intentions in the pensions field.

The Commission will ensure, it said, that any restrictions that apply
in particular Member States will be "fully justified on the prudential
and other grounds upon which such restricutions have been applied and
they are proportional to their objectives".

The Communication said that the Commission had to withdraw the proposal
because it"refused to make the text acceptable to a majority of member
states by inserting certain amendments which risk to completely change
the sense of the Directive".

The draft directive was dogged by conflict on the issues of scope,
localisation of assets and currency matching. The currency matching
provision - requiring that a minimum proportion of funds should be
invested in the currency in which pensions would be paid - was most
troublesome and was the main contributor to the downfall of the draft.

Most member states wanted to keep the power to require 80 percent
currency matching, ensuring consistency with the insurance Directives.
The Commission, backed by the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands, was
determined to give pension funds the ability to invest freely in
whatever markets they wanted - subject to prudent limits. Sixty
percent, the commission felt, was a reasonable limit - given that those
with complete freedom to invest rarely exceed 40 percent.

The Commission's move comes as European think tank, Federal Trust,
released a report The Pension Time Bomb in Europe, which predicts that,
without radical changes, maintaining level of benefits provided by Pay-
As-You-Go schemes in line with present expectations will impose an
unacceptable burden on future generations of taxpayers, will worsen the
competitiveness of industry and will harm the prospects for employment
and the economy.

The three original aims of the draft Pension Fund Directive - freedom
of cross-border membership, freedom to provide the service of managing
pension funds and freedom of cross-border investment of fund assets -
should not be abandoned, the report argues, but should be pursued by
other means.

Drastic cuts in benefits or rises in contribution, it maintains, can be
avoided by establishing a partnership between Pay-As-You- Go and
privately-funded pension schemes. Maximisation of benefits and the
minimisation of costs under private schemes requires that fund managers
have the maximum freedom to invest, subject to prudential safeguards.

THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES

The New Year may herald a new era in the UK life insurance business,
with onerous new disclosure requirements. Alison Jarman reports

AFTER A year which saw the UK life industry's reputation shredded by
the scandal of mis-sold pensions, 1995 is widely expected to bring big
changes as insurers begin providing full details of fees and charges
and the effect these have on the return to investors.

Prompted by consumer complaints that front-end loading of fees resulted
in minimal surrender values - almost non-existent generally during the
first five years of a 25 year policy - the Securities and Investments
Board (SIB) has finally put in place a disclosure regime which gives
the customer a clear idea of the return of a policy and the factors
affecting it.

January 1 saw the introduction of the long-awaited commission
disclosure rules, but while pundits have welcomed the greater
transparency, insurers are now waiting to see how the public reacts to
the latest rattling of skeletons from their closets. Aware that
brazenly admitting that in the case of many policies, the first two
years of premium is eaten up in commission and other charges would not
be wise, companies have been working hard to create a structure which
will make the new regime workable and limit the damage as far as
possible.

Under new SIB rules, before customers buy a life or pension product,
they must be presented with paperwork outlining the type of product,
its workings and, where appropriate, surrender values. A key feature of
this is to illustrate how commission charges and other fees affect the
policy, how much of the premium goes to the salesperson and return for
early surrender at certain dates. After July the information will have
to be even more specific, relating directly to the customers own
financial circumstances and lifestyle, rather than the insurers'
generic models.

Although easily explained, the process of introducing these features
has been taxing the industry throughout 1994, and has resulted in
revamping of products and restructuring of salesforces and the way
these and independent financial advisers are paid. With comparative
tables likely to become widely available, enabling customers to shop
around for competitive products, companies have been forced to address
not only the question of front-end loading but the nature of commission
payments themselves.

They have also been forced to take a hard look at the types of products
on offer. During the final months of 1994, Allied Dunbar, the
Prudential and Clerical Medical all launched flexible life and savings
schemes. Allied Dunbar, one of the country's leading pensions
suppliers, went so far as to withdraw its product range and replace it
with a smaller selection of new products. Other insurers are expected
to follow this shake-up as they struggle to cope with changing customer
needs.

New style policies reflect the changing labour market which
increasingly relies on short-term contracts. The concept of a job for
life is becoming rarer. Essentially the change means that, for the
industry, the standard sale now longer exists.

Potentially the greatest threat stemming from disclosure is that public
reaction to the charges will result in a switch entirely away from life
and pensions products. Research conducted by consultants National
Economic Research Associates (NERA) forecasts that sales will drop by
10 percent following the introduction of disclosure.

Last year's public reaction to concern over mis-selling was to stop
buying, a public vote of no confidence which hit profits and share
values. There is little to suggest that providing more information will
prevent the same thing happening again.

Within a smaller market, public awareness of costs will force companies
to cut costs further, with a resulting squeeze on profitability. But
these cuts are likely to be achieved through greater use of technology,
particularly EDI systems, and a squeezing out of less competitive
players on both sides of the selling line. Behind the factfinds and
reams of new customer- friendly information is the knowledge that
commission levels remain largely unchanged - only the way they are paid
has been altered.

Commissions paid during 1992 are estimated at #2.5 billion ($3.96
billion or half the total cost of winning new business in that year.
According to NERA, the disclosure shake-up will cut industry costs by
#800 million. Part of the commission bill will be cut by smaller
salesforces, but commission levels are not falling.

How commission is taken has become as flexible as the new-style
policies. How much a product will cost in future and how much it will
generate for company and salesperson will depend on the agreement
between the company and the seller. It will reflect the complexity of
the product and a willingness to buy add-ons.

At Standard Life, commission levels to Independent Financial Advisers
(IFAs) are being maintained, although surrender values are also being
increased. In this case, the company is financing the initial costs
itself, deducting them over the life of the entire policy. IFAs are
being allowed to pick and choose between level commission, indemnity
commission or any combination of the two. If they decide to rebate
commission this will not cause problems.

Clerical Medical, which distributes its products through IFAs, is
committed to protecting its salesforce, and has introduced a complete
range of flexible products and commission structures. "We believe that
our commission flexibility options meet the majority of IFA's
requirements," says Mike Elcock, Clerical Medical's disclosure product
manager.

"Once the new regime is in place and IFAs can measure the impact of
these changes on their business, we will need to review our initial
arrangements to ensure that IFAs get the help and service they need to
operate efficiently and effectively."

While the possible initial reaction may be to drive some customers away
from the market, the impact on the shape of that market in the long-
term is not limited to 10 percent of business. Bacon & Woodrow
forecasts that the number of companies operating in the market will
drop by 40 percent by the end of the decade, as price competition
forces them out. Changes in the IFA market are expected to arrive far
more quickly, as many move to become member of larger networks.

"We're likely to see growth in networks, with perhaps fewer, bigger
networks," predicts Geoff Show, life and pensions financial controller
at Norwich Union, which draws heavily on the IFA sector for its sales.
The advantage to the customer of larger networks will be that greater
size and income means that "they will be able to offer more talent,
research and skills", providing a competitive edge to smaller firms.
"IFAs will be able to decide how best to present commission charges,"
according to scales of commission previously registered with Norwich
Union, and ask for a quotation as they feel appropriate.

The IFA's key sales point - the independence to choose products from
across the entire market - should also provide them with an advantage,
providing the service matches the cost.

Switching to operating on a fee-only basis appears a strong
possibility, although customers are being warned that depending on the
complexity of the work accumulated hourly fees could outweigh
commission charges unless a substantial portfolio is involved. Tony
Shepherd, chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning (IFP),
comments: "Typically, most members of the IFP register charge between
#75 and #125. If any adviser is charging more than #150 per hour, there
needs to be a good reason for it."

The dilemma facing many IFAs as well as members of direct salesforces
therefore is not whether commissions will drop, because sufficient
structures have been put in place to protect this, but whether they
will see commissions at all. Pressure will fall this year on the IFA
sector where competition on pricing will force many into networks or
out of business altogether. Direct salesforces felt the first pain of
disclosure last year.

Banks, building societies and insurers forced to withdraw salesforces
for retraining took the opportunity to reduce them in size at the same
time and switch them from commission-only to salaried status.

In its annual survey of industry employment, the Life Insurance
Marketing and Research Association (LIMRA) reported that the industry
salesforce declined by one-sixth in the first nine months of 1994. For
every six salespeople at the beginning of the year, there were five by
October. Its findings suggest that the trend will continue downwards.

Leavers are not being replaced on a one-for-one basis and recruitment
is far more stringent. "What we are seeing is a steady upgrading of the
quality of the salesforce," comments Frank Fletcher, LIMRA Europe's
research director. "Companies are being increasingly selective in the
people they retain and even more selective in the quality of people
they take on."

Although it doesn't anticipate heavy job cuts, Midland Bank has taken
the decision to integrate its 850-strong life and pensions salesforce
into its branch network (see page 6), which will bring about economies
of scale.

It is impossible to judge how the public will react to the increased
amount of information which the industry has so assiduously provided,
but undoubtedly perceived value for money will be an important sales
factor.

Research undertaken for consulting group Merchants indicates that
consumers are increasingly proactive when it comes to purchasing
products, indicating that the industry adage that products are "sold
rather than bought" is a false one.

Up to two-thirds of customers approach companies to make a purchase, a
factor which demolishes many arguments that an established sales
relationship will generate more business. The highly stable market of
recent years has meant that "the nuances and foibles of consumers have
often been shielded from the life assurance companies by intermediary
salesforces", Merchants concludes.

In the survey, only 22 percent said that commission levels are a "very
important" factor when choosing a product, although overall value for
money is an important factor. As a result, consumers may use the new
disclosure information to take a longer-term view of their investment
choice, rather than leaping at the lowest commission figure. "The
companies which are most likely to suffer a consumer reaction . . . are
those with uncompetitive charges or return on investment record - not
those companies which operate high commission channels," says
Merchants. Soft factors, such as speed and accuracy of response, and a
complete answer to queries, also rate highly, indicating that attention
to pricing and good service will help companies build their competitive
advantage.

For the increasing numbers of customers familiar with purchasing
financial services over the telephone, direct sales of life and
pensions products will offer an attractive low-cost high-service
package. In addition to established direct writers such as Direct Line,
1995 has seen the news that entrepreneur Richard Branson's Virgin Group
will be launching a direct life and pensions company, Virgin Direct
(see page 5). A spokesman for Virgin said that the new company will
beat all traditional suppliers of pensions and life cover on price and
costs.

Norwich Union, which is joint, equal partner in the operation,
providing third-party administration and fund management expertise,
will in return benefit from connections with an organisation built on
strong service-led principles and affordable products. It should also
be borne in mind that Branson has assiduously avoided getting involved
in any business which would damage the Virgin brand, indicating that he
will avoid the structures which have hampered and harmed the rest of
the life industry.

Virgin's low-cost approach will be followed by that of another trusted
UK brand, Marks & Spencer. Its concept of reliable quality at slightly
above average pricing is likely to prove a success in this sector as it
has in others. It has an extensive network of shops in the UK, which is
also growing worldwide. Like Virgin, and perhaps unlike the industry,
it too is strong on brand protection.

Disclosure represents a major step change which will alter the face of
the industry. Its supposed new transparency which will be of such
benefit to the consumer is largely cosmetic compared with the knock-on
effect for the industry itself. For well-known new entrants, like Marks
& Spencer, disclosure offers an opportunity and a shock as it enters
the only industry which legally has to admit by how much a product is
marked-up between wholesale and retail price.

PRUDENTIAL MOVES INTO THAILAND

PRUDENTIAL CORPORATION of the UK has broken into Thailand, buying a
24.99 percent stake in a small local insurance company, Thai Sethakit
Life Assurance PLC (TS Life), at a cost of some #13 million ($20.2
million). Prudential is acting through a joint- venture company Staple,
set up with local businessman, Roan Asvinvichit and other affiliates.
It plans to bid for the remaining shares of TS Life in a tender offer
through Staple. Thai insurance law prohibits foreign entities from
owning more than 25 percent of a Thai insurance company.

Eventually, Asvinvichit will acquire between 15 percent and 20 percent
of TS Life, while the rest will go to minority shareholders, predicted
sources at advisers Peregrine and Morgan Grenfell. The tender offer,
priced at Baht 65 ($2.59) per share, will be made in February.

Prudential may give a new lease of life to languishing TS Life. It may
also provide competition for American International Assurance (AIA),
the only wholly-owned foreign entity of the 12 life companies operating
in the country.

Thailand has some 6 million life insurance policyholders, with total
premium for 1994 forecast to reach Baht 37 billion. Thai insurers have
teamed up to combat the threat posed by AIA, which has carved out a
market share estimated at 58 percent of the total life premiums and 20
percent of policyholders. Last year, AIA quit the Thai Life Assurance
Association, citing irreconcilable differences with the members.

Most recently, Thai insurers have charged that AIA infringed Thai
insurance law by opening offices outside Bangkok, the capital. Overseas
insurance companies are restricted from conducting their insurance
business outside the capital city, but AIA contends that the offices
have no relation to its insurance operations, are not connected to the
activities of the Bangkok head office and do not contribute financially
to it.

AIA has established a superior branding image, backed up by a more
efficient organisation and an aggressive salesforce.

To boost efficiency, domestic companies have agreed not to poach sales
staff from each other. The association is committed to spending up to
Baht 1 million in training and has roped in US- based Life Insurance
Management and Research Association (LIMRA) to assist.

Soontorn Boonsai, president of the association and Ayudhya Life
Assurance plc, said that all these measures cannot ensure that local
companies will be able to compete effectively with AIA.

POLAND:  TAX ON COMMISSION STARTS ROW

THE JANUARY 16 introduction of 22 percent VAT (value added tax) on
commissions of Polish insurance brokers and agents has stirred the
Association of Insurance Brokers to write a letter of protest to the
Ministry of Finance.

Chairman Leon Kozicki, objects to the tax largely because insurance
companies are exempt. It is too early for such a tax as brokers have
not yet reached full profitability," he said. Brokers have been
operating in Poland for two to three years. "This is a three-pronged
problem," argued Grace Zrodlowski-Kabat, managing director of Sedgwick
Poland."A new developing industry is being curbed; the move is
inconsistent with EC law on VAT registration; and it will stifle the
entire insurance market."

Polish insurance premiums are not subject to VAT, and the question
arises now as to whether they will have to go up to compensate.

CU GETS PAKISTAN PERMIT

COMMERCIAL UNION (CU), the UK's largest composite insurer, has been
granted permission to write life business in the newly- opened Pakistan
market.

CU is the largest non-life foreign insurer in Pakistan and has been
keen to get a life licence since the market, nationalised in 1972, was
opened up to local life insurers in 1991, Steve Corfield, life
development manager in CU's overseas division, told LII.

It is the second foreign life insurer to win entry - in May last year,
American International Group, the largest international US insurer, was
granted initial permission to set up a life company.

"We still have plenty of work to do as the penetration of life
insurance is very low," Corfield said. Only 2 million people, out of a
population of 120 million, have life insurance cover."We will now go
into a stage of developing our infrastructure for a life operation,
working on product development, systems and so on," he said.

Corfield said CU expects to build its own distribution network as the
state company has a substantial tied agency force .

The company also hopes to build on its non-life contacts - it has a 5
percent market share, with approximate net written premiums of 160
million rupees ($5.2 million) last year.

AIG WINS RUSSIAN LICENCE

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL Group (AIG), the US's leading international
insurer, has become the first American insurer to receive a licence to
operate a sizeable partnership business in Russia.

AIG's Russian partners are Moscow-based Stolichny Bank of Savings and
the recently-formed, joint-stock company Garant- Invest.

The new company, RUS AIG, will be managed by AIG, which capitalised the
$3 million venture. AIG's central European senior executive Bengt
Westergren, will chair the board. Russian insurance expert, Andrei
Saznov, will act as general manager in Moscow.

RUS AIG, which will open in St Petersburg later this year, will offer
individual health, travel and motor insurance, as well as commercial
insurance.

Russian partner, Garant-Invest, was formed in September 1992 to provide
financial and investment services. Stolichny Bank of Savings is one of
Russia's largest retail and commercial banks, with 30 branches - it
also has the Federation's largest network of automated cash dispensers.

VIRGIN CHALLENGES `NEANDERTHAL' INSURERS

AFTER REVOLUTIONISING the airline industry and taking Coca-Cola head-
on, entrepreneur Richard Branson is to tackle the UK's "Neanderthal"
financial services industry.

Virgin Direct, a joint venture between Virgin Group and Norwich Union,
will begin selling its first product, a no-fee Personal Equity Plan
(PEP), at the end of February.

Virgin aims to be a niche player in the life and pensions market, with
no intention of becoming "a mainstream direct banker", according to
spokesman Will Whitehorn. He stressed that the company would "like to
be a major player in a non- essential market".

Virgin targets niche markets for non-essential products, placing its
emphasis on bettering rival services at a lower price. Operating a
direct telesales service is an astute move on cost grounds and this,
combined with Virgin's service reputation and strong brand, will
attract custom - as will Richard Branson's image for challenging the
status quo. The group claims that there are 18 million Britons working
without pensions provisions.

Norwich Union is providing fund management and third-party
administration for the 50:50 joint venture, with the Virgin fund being
managed exclusive of Norwich Union business.

Speculation has surrounded Norwich Union's recent research into the
direct market - despite its widely stated commitment to the broker and
Independent Financial Adviser (IFA) market.

Before Christmas, the insurer said it was keeping up to date on
developments in the direct market. Once news of the Virgin joint
venture broke on January 1, a Norwich Union spokesman said that the
launch does not rule out further direct ventures, but at the same time
said the company remains "committed to the intermediary market".

Initially, telesales staff will operate from Norwich. The product
range, designed to Virgin's specifications, will roll out over the next
year to provide four or five cost-effective products, including a
single premium life and pensions product and a unit trust.

The inclusion of a flexible life and pension policy suggests that
Virgin has spotted this niche quicker than established insurers who are
only just beginning to design products which reflect today's flexible
employment market.

Virgin earlier rebuffed several approaches to bring its high- service,
low-cost approach to the financial services market, but a combination
of 1994's pensions scandal and the disclosure regime had suggested an
opening in the market for Virgin, Whitehorn said.

"This highlighted the expensive, Neanderthal selling structure of the
industry, while disclosure represents a major regulatory change which
breaks down barriers to entry. There was obviously an opportunity for a
`green field' operation to dramatically reduce costs across the
market."

LIFE COMPANIES EXPLOIT DIRECT LEADS

UK LIFE companies are using rival direct insurers to drum up sales
leads. Standard Life, which generates most of its life and pensions
business through independent financial advisers, has confirmed its
links with direct writer, Churchill Insurance.

Churchill, with 600,000 policyholders the UK's second-largest house and
motor direct writer after Direct Line, is acting as an introducer for
Standard Life. The direct insurer follows up sales leads from customers
who have requested further financial services information on publicity
and proposal forms. Telesales staff explain different products and
arrange an appointment with a Standard Life salesperson - although in
some cases they complete sales of products such as term assurance.

In addition to contributing towards the training of Churchill telesales
staff, Standard Life pays Churchill commission on sales generated.

The arrangement is not the only one of its kind. Sun Life uses
Prospero, the direct arm of Provincial insurance, to generate leads,
while Admiral, the Lloyd's of London direct insurer, was an appointed

A spokesman for the Scottish Life house said that Admiral had
investigated whether it was possible to"cold-sell term assurance
products". Admiral is now pressing ahead with its own direct life
insurer.

HALIFAX SETS DIRECT TARGET

HALIFAX BUILDING Society plans to move into direct life and general
insurance sales if a proposed direct personal banking service takes
off, according to general manager David Gilchrist. Both developments
partly depend on whether the planned merger between the UK's biggest
building society and Leeds Permanent goes ahead.

Gilchrist said that both societies are interested in telephone banking,
and providing this service as a merged operation would reduce the
expense. Developing this to offer classes of insurance is also a
possibility, he said.

The two societies announced merger plans in November 1994. Should they
gain the support of members, they would then convert to a PLC (public
limited company) to become the country's third- largest bank.

Failure would not preclude developing the service: both societies have
fledgling life insurance arms (Halifax launched its company on January
9), and, following changes to the Building Societies Act, are able to
write housing-related general business.

Bradford & Bingley has announced plans to launch a telephone mortgage
service in spring. It will target borrowers with substantial equity
with an exclusive discounted mortgage, unavailable through its branch
network.

ZURICH SCORES ALLFINANZ COUP IN ITALIAN MARKET

ZURICH INSURANCE'S Italian branch office is to establish a life company
in conjunction with Banco di Napoli, Italy's sixth- largest bank.

The new company will sell its products at over 800 Banco di Napoli
branches. It has yet to get a licence, but should be operational by
autumn, according to Peter Schenker, Zurich senior vice-president for
Southern Europe.

Zurich will sell simple life products through the bank branches, he
said."As there is still a legal barrier in Italy, preventing banks from
selling products for which advice is necessary, it is only possible to
sell standard products."

The insurer already had some local co-operation agreements in Italy but
was keen to develop a countrywide distribution network - Banco di
Napoli was the last of the top eight Italian banks without an allfinanz
link.

Zurich, with a network of about 600 agents, is a small player on the
Italian life market - last year's estimated premiums written of L260
billion ($159.6 million) represents a market share of about 1.5 percent
- and Schenker said the company hopes the new agreement will help it to
break into the top ten life insurers. The market leaders, Generali, RAS
and INA, have market shares of 10 percent-15 percent.

SWEDEN:  TRYGG-HANSA PLANS BANK

TRYGG-HANSA, the leading Swedish life insurer, has received a banking
licence and is to open a niche bank focusing on deposits and individual
pension-savings products. Trygg-Banken, which will open in the second
quarter of 1995, will target Trygg-Hansa's 1.7 million policyholders.

Lars Thunell, chief executive of Trygg-Hansa, noted that the move will
allow the company to operate on the same terms as other Swedish
insurers. Rival insurer Skandia, with 1.5 million policyholders,
launched SkandiaBanken on October 3 1994 (see LII 64).

Skandia created the bank both to expand its product range to include
deposit accounts and other standardised banking products and to allow
it to offer higher rates to its pensions customers.

AUSTRIA:  DIE ERSTE LAUNCHES FUND-LINKED PRODUCT

DIE ERSTE Osterreichische Sparkasse, the fourth-largest Austrian bank,
has become the first bank to introduce a fund-linked insurance product
on to the market. The launch in December, was in conjunction with
German insurer Nurnberger Lebensversicherung.

The bank's insurance subsidiary, Versicherungs Makler Gesellschaft,
will manage the product - the insurer already offers traditional life
insurance and some general insurance products and 99 percent of its
business is with individuals.

Die Erste's 240 outlets will be used as the distribution channel,
according to Anton Freitag, Die Erste's head of market segmentation.
The development of fund-linked insurance products in Austria will, he
predicts, be similar to that in Germany. Freitag envisages that it will
be a niche product.

Nurnberger Lebensversicherung AG is the biggest provider of fund-
linked insurance products on the German market.

UNITED KINGDOM:  MIDLAND REVAMPS SALESFORCE

MIDLAND BANK, the UK's third-largest, is integrating its 850- strong
life insurance and pensions salesforce into its network of 1,740 bank
branches.

Midland is retraining staff to meet the new rules on product and
commission disclosure which came into effect on January 1 (see pages 10-
11).

The bank recently revamped life, pension and investment business and
claims that it is going beyond the regulations by including commission
disclosure on life and non-life regulated products and client-specific
illustrations. Midland investors will be informed about surrender and
maturity values and the effect of charges.

Midland has also made unit trusts and PEPs more competitive, reducing
the initial charge from 6 percent to 4 percent, and halving the minimum
regular savings contribution from #100 to #150 ($155.35-$233).

At the same time, Midland has introduced a new payment structure for
its salesforce, based on a considerably higher salary compared with
commission.

POLAND:  WARTA AND PKO LINK UP

WARTA, POLAND'S second-largest insurer, is to create a life insurance
company with the state-owned bank PKO BP. Both will hold a 40 percent
stake in the new company, Warta-Vita.

Warta-Vita intends to compete with Panstowy Zaklad Ubezpiecen (PZU),
which controls 95 per cent of the market and concentrates on group
insurance.

Warta-Vita will emphasise"western-type" individual products, said
Warta's Olga Doan, who has been involved in planning the venture for
three years and will be on the board of directors of Warta- Vita. It
will also introduce one new group product.

Fund-linked insurance products are a definite consideration for the
future - Thomas Klaricki, director of banking investment at PKO BPK,
noted that the bank should have important input in fund management.

Klaricki believes the venture will influence product design to suit
customer needs. Allfinanz is not a new notion for PKO BP, which before
the war offered life insurance products to its customers.

Products will be distributed through Warta insurance agents and the 800
branch network of PKO BP. Warta-Vita has applied for its licence and
expects to start operating in April.

AIG LINKS WITH ITALIAN UNION

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL Group (AIG) has teamed up with an Italian trade
union, Cisi, to access the growing demand for private pensions and
insurance cover in the market. Unionvita, owned 51 percent by the trade
union and 49 percent by Alico, AIG's Italian life subsidiary, was
authorised at end-December - its management will come from the American
insurer.

Guido Laudini, Unionvita managing director, said the joint venture
should be highly beneficial to both parties. "Alico does not have a
sales network or any existing agreements so we were keen to fill the
gap," he said.

"In many ways the venture will be similar to a bancassurance link, with
upfront costs reduced to the minimum and a large captive market to
which the requisite products can be offered."

Cisi was keen to find an international partner, Laudini said. "They
preferred a foreign company because a similar link-up with an Italian
operator would find itself competing with the partners existing sales
network."

The union has 4 million members and already operates a consultancy
service for pensions, insurance and fiscal matters -
 also available to non-union members.

"Italy is significantly underinsured as a country," Laudini noted."In
1992, only 0.8 per cent of Italian GDP went on life insurance premiums
so the prospects for growth are very good. In addition, the range of
products is likely to expand because most life insurance is still used
as a saving instrument rather than as cover against a person's death."

BERLUSCONI GROUP SEEKS BANKING STATUS

PROGRAMME ITALIA, the Italian financial services group which owns one
of Italy's leading life operators, Mediolanum Vita, has decided to
restructure and seek banking status. The ownership of the group is also
under discussion.

Managing director, Ennio Doris, has expressed a desire to acquire a
majority stake from Fininvest and the outgoing Italian prime minister,
Silvio Berlusconi, with whom he started the company in 1982.

The decision to convert to a bank, according to Doris, is "a natural
evolutionary step to exploit the company's expertise in various sectors
of the Italian financial services market". As a bank, he pointed out,
Programme Italia will be in a better position to focus on core
businesses and to widen the range of products and services.

Programme Italia will not open banking branches for its clientele,
preferring to operate almost exclusively through its extensive sales
network - the current 2,000 consultants will be increased to 3,000 by
the time the bank is launched in 1996.

Mediolanum Vita, Italy's sixth-largest life company, saw its premium
income rise by more than 30 percent to L552 billion ($338.8 million) in
the first ten months of 1994. Sales of Programme Italia's 15 mutual
funds increased by more than 40 percent over the same period and the
group's total turnover grew by 27 percent to l,909 billion.

Doris said it is likely that there will be a reorganisation of the
group and this will affect the shareholding structure. "I am ready to
take the leading role in the company if that is the result," he
said."If necessary, I will look for partners to help finance an
eventual acquisition."

BELGIAN POST OFFICE SEEKS PARTNER

THE BELGIAN post office, De Postcheque, is planning to distribute
products such as insurance, mortgages and loans through its post office
network and has narrowed the choice of candidates down to the last few.

In late 1994, De Postcheque invited 260 financial companies in Belgium
to tender. Among the final contenders are Belgian insurer Royale Belge
and ING, the Dutch allfinanz group, which recently decided to develop
its international allfinanz operations (see LII 64), according to
Freddie Weyers, project manager at De Postcheque.

ING Group has a 100 percent-owned subsidiary, Postbank, which sells
products through the Dutch post office and "would like to apply this
experience elsewhere", according to a company spokesman. The
conglomerate already has a life office in Belgium, La Patriotique,
offering financial services including insurance.

De Postcheque is prohibited by law from acting as a bank,"so if we want
to offer more sophisticated products to our customers, we must enter
into a partnership", said Weyers.

De Postcheque has between 1,700 and 1,800 offices throughout Belgium.
If it enters into a co-operation with a financial group, such as ING,
it is only permitted by law to have that one partner. It can, however,
have as many insurance partners as it wants.

AMB AND AGF PULL CLOSER

AACHENER UND Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second largest
insurer, and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the second-largest
composite insurer in France, are pulling closer together.

AMB, which currently holds 2.57 percent of AGF's share capital, will
increase its holding to 5 percent on or before June 30 1995. In future,
a representative from AMB will be entitled to attend meetings of AGF's
administrative council. AGF must maintain its stake in AMB at 33.55
percent until December 31 1999. In the first half of 1994 this stake
contributed Fr106 million ($19.72 million) to AGF's net earnings,
almost twice the amount recorded the previous year.

A working group of experts from both companies is being formed to
define and develop areas of co-operation. AMB is keen to look at AGF's
experience with market segmentation, while AGF is interested in AMB's
direct selling knowledge, gained through its associate direct insurer
COSMOS.

On an international level, AMB and AGF will be formulating combined
strategies, although it is not yet clear what form these strategies
will take.

AMB has set up a building society in Strasburg and this is a business
area AGF may develop in France.

ALLIANZ, BERNER TO CO-OPERATE

ALLIANZ, EUROPE's largest insurer has sealed a co-operation agreement
with Berner Insurance of Switzerland, in which it bought a 31.5 percent
stake last year, giving it a sizeable foothold on the Swiss market.

The essence of the Berner agreement is exchange of information, Allianz
spokesman Emilio Galli-Zugaro told LII. Gerhardt Rupprecht, Allianz
board member, is in charge of know-how transfers within the group and
Berner will participate in working committees focused on the European
market.

"On the investment side, they can be part of our financial committees,
deciding where to allocate resources, investment etcetera," Galli-
Zugaro said. "International investment know-how is not as big at
Berner." Information exchange will extend across the board - in
electronic data processing, for example, the Allianz sales force in
Germany is equipped with lap- top computers and this could be a
possibility for Switzerland.

On the product side, Galli-Zugaro argued that the potential for
innovation may not be huge. Fund-linked products are already available
in Germany but are not popular, he pointed out.  "We would be ready to
launch them tomorrow - we have our own investment management, but we
don't want gimmicks." Information exchange on mortality and actuarial
tables will be important.

The companies will be looking at all processes. Berner has been
carrying out a cost-cutting programme in recent years and this will
continue.

NEW YORK AND ST. JAMES CAPITAL LINK

NEW YORK Life Worldwide Holding, a subsidiary of New York Life
Insurance Company, has announced the formation of a new company with UK-
based, St. James Place Capital (SJPC), to pursue its UK acquisition
strategy.

The company, Life Assurance Holding Corporation (LAHC), will be
capitalised at $100 million, with New York Life Worldwide and SJPC each
contributing $31.25 million.

Capital commitments have also been made by financial institutions such
as Chase Investment Bank, PosTel, Scottish Amicable, Invesco, and John
Rothschild Assurance Holdings. "LAHC is designed to help us participate
in the consolidation which is taking place in the UK life market," said
William Mowat, executive vice president and chief financial officer of
New York Life, who compared the new company to Conseco, a leading buy-
out firm in the US.

One of the largest life insurance companies in the US, New York Life's
previous UK acquisitions include Windsor Life Assurance Company, in
1989; Gresham Life, in 1992; and US Aetna's UK life business, which it
bought in 1993.

The Windsor Life Assurance Company, sold to LAHC by New York Life (UK)
as part of the transaction, will serve as the LAHC vehicle for life
acquisitions. Windsor's chairman, John Wybrew, will act as chief
executive; SJPC chairman, Sir Mark Weinberg, was appointed chairman;
and William Yelverton, chief executive officer of New York Life
Worldwide, is vice- chairman.

BRADESCO MOVES INTO ARGENTINA

BRAZIL'S LARGEST insurer, Bradesco, has bought a 70 percent stake in La
Rosario Companhia Argentina de Seguros, an inactive Argentinian
insurance company belonging to that country's Roberts allfinanz
conglomerate.

The move is part of a trend started by the economic integration of the
two countries into the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosul), which
came into formal existence on January 1 and also includes Uruguay and
Paraguay.

Already, other major Brazilian players, such as Bamerindus and Sul
America, have set up operations in Buenos Aires, as have multinational
insurance groups, such as AGF and Mapfre, with their Brazilian
subsidiaries managing the operations.

Bradesco's move into Argentina is noteworthy, given the size of the
Brazilian insurer. It has a net worth of $1.5 billion, more than double
the collective net worth of all the 220 companies operating in
Argentina.

Even in Brazil, Bradesco dwarfs the competition - its annual premiums
amount to over $300 million, twice that of the number two on the
market. The Argentinian market had total premiums of about 4.5 billion
in June 1994, some 64 percent the size of the Brazilian market.

The new company will be headquartered in Buenos Aires, with the
operational side run by La Buenos Aires, the largest insurer in the
Roberts Group.

CZECHS SLATE NEW PENSION PROPOSALS

CZECH TRADE unions staged a 15-minute national strike on December 21,
the first since the 1989 revolution, protesting against a pensions
reform bill recently submitted to Parliament.

Pension fund management has become a boom industry in the Czech
Republic, especially for banks, but it's a bone of contention for
unions and pensioners opposed to reforms which also affect the health
industry.

Unions and pensioners are concerned that the bill gives the government
powers to alter pension rates without indexation and to raise the
pensionable age for men to 65 years. Men currently retire at age 60 and
women from age 54 to 57, depending on the number of their children.

The basic pension is around half of the worker's previous salary, but
with monthly salaries averaging only CK7,000 ($200), 62 percent of all
pensioners complain they cannot cope, according to a poll by the
Chamber of Trade Unions. Of these, more than half supplement their
pensions from their savings, according to the poll.

The debate has helped boost the profile of newly-formed private
pensions and fund managers claim demand has been strong among the few
workers to be offered the schemes to date. Most schemes are run by
Czech banks and other institutions with large employee or client bases.
Since October, when private pension funds were first allowed to
operate, 21 licences have been granted and a further 23 applications
are pending.

Many leading funds are run as joint ventures, often between a bank and
one or more financial specialists such as insurance companies, although
notable stand-alone operations include those of Komercni Banka and
Winterthur Life (see LII 65).

Among the largest non-financial firms offering pensions are a group of
construction firms based in Prague (Stavebni penzijni fond) and a joint-
venture between trading companies in Northeast Moravia (Bansky a hutni
penzijni fond Trinec).

Minimum capital is CK20 million, but Penzijni fond Ceske Pojistovna,
run by the Czech Insurance Company, has the largest base capital at
CK90 million. Pension funds can offer products including standard
retirement incomes, disability and inheritable pensions and lump-sum
contributions.

Employees select their own fund and manage their own contributions.
Employers may supplement payments, but are not required to. The
government is offering supplementary payments, depending on the
employee contribution.

All pension funds must be open to all Czech citizens and are restricted
to conservative investments, including government securities, property
and blue chip shares listed on the Prague Stock Exchange. The law also
requires 85 per cent of funds to be distributed and a further 5 per
cent to be held as reserves.

Some funds are offering rates of return of up to 10 percent - recalling
the feverish competition between investment privatisation funds which
bid one another up until they were offering rates of return which
failed to materialise.

BRITISH GOVERNMENT MAKES FRESH PENSIONS MOVE

PROMPTED BY recent high-profile cases of plundering of company pension
schemes, the UK government has placed new pensions legislation before
Parliament.

It proposes a new regulatory authority far larger than that anticipated
in an earlier White Paper. With 200 staff and a seven-member
controlling panel, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority
(OPRA) will be bigger than the financial services watchdog, the
Securities and Investments Board (SIB).

The bill includes many of the findings of the Goode Committee, which
recommended widespread change to pensions legislation to prevent cases
such as that of the Maxwell Pension Fund, which was raided by chairman
Robert Maxwell prior to his death three years ago (see LII 64). It also
equalises pensions ages for men and women at 65.

Among the changes are index-linking of pensions fund benefits to the
Retail Price Index (RPI) or 5 percent a year - whichever is smaller -
and a requirement for minimum solvency standards for pension funds.

The latter has already generated debate. The bill contains no actual
figures and some MPs are concerned that some companies may keep their
funds to the bare minimum and avoid the build-up of large surpluses.

Overall, the cost to the pensions industry of index-linking benefits,
meeting solvency requirements (still to be decided), plus establishing
OPRA has been estimated at #165 million ($256.3 million) a year, plus a
#400 million one-off charge.

UNION TO SUE OVER UK PENSIONS SCANDAL

A UNION representing members who were mis-sold pensions during the
1980s has said that it will not wait for official investigations to be
completed before taking legal action against life and pensions
companies.

Bill Day, National Pensions Officer for the GMB union, which represents
general and municipal employees including teachers and health workers,
said that the union had identified more than 100 cases where
individuals were wrongly advised to opt out of union or company schemes
into personal pensions.

Although the entire UK life and pensions industry is reviewing
potential mis-selling, following the Securities and Investments Board's
(SIB) report that more than 250,000 pensions customers were wrongly
advised, GMB has said that it will not wait until the end of the 18-
month review. "We're not happy with the level of compensation that the
SIB recommends in the review and there is no suggestion of damages,"
said Day. "We want to test it in court."

When the action reaches court, expected to be in several months time,
it will test SIB's approach to the mis-selling scandal and increase the
bad publicity surrounding the industry.

Concerns were expressed in October 1994 that SIB's schedule might
prevent some individuals from taking legal action due to the statute of
limitations. The GMB move may result from such concerns, although a
spokesman would not confirm this.

VITAL REQUESTS SHARE SUSPENSION

VITAL, NORWAY'S second-largest insurer, saw some turbulence in early
January. On January 4, the company, which has a 20 percent market
share, asked the Oslo stock exchange to suspend trading in its shares
after the share price was hit by rumours that it was in negotiations
with international insurers.

Vital, which reported a loss of NKr97 million ($14.27 million) for the
third quarter of 1994, compared with a profit of NKr2.3 billion the
previous year, admitted that it was "considering various structural
alternatives, including international options". This is motivated, the
company said, by the internationalisation expected as a result of the
European Economic Area (EEA) and the termination of its co-operation
with Den norske Bank in October last year.

Last year's losses were largely as a result of rising interest rates,
which hit the value of Vital's bond portfolio. Premium income at the
end of the third quarter stood at NKr2.8 billion, up from NKr2.3
billion.

Trading resumed on January 11 - Vital has said that discussions are
closed for the moment and that it will initiate no new talks, although
a spokesman said it would "give all approaches consideration".

PRUDENTIAL MAKES FRAUD PROVISION

PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE Company, the US's biggest life insurer, is
injecting its securities division with $365 million to help buoy it
against the spiralling expense of fraud settlements.

Prudential Securities has cost its parent company $1.6 billion since
1981 through settlements with defrauded investors, many of whom bought
limited partnerships presented as being "safe" but actually high-risk.
So far, Prudential Securities has paid over $650 million to a
restitution fund established by the Justice Department and the
Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC). To date, a relatively small
percentage of 56,000 claimants have received total settlements of $397
million. However, reports from law firm Storch & Brenner indicate that
claims total about 152,000 - and growing.

The firm, selected to assist with fund administration, said claims
filed against Pru Securities doubled to almost 3,000 a week, as the
January 10 filing deadline approached.

IRISH LIFE FINED BY LAUTRO

IRISH LIFE has been fined #300,000 by Lautro, the UK life insurance
disciplinary authority, and ordered to pay Lautro's #85,000 costs. The
fine related to charges of: failure to deal satisfactorily with
complaints; failure to adhere to Lautro recruitment requirements for
some appointed sales representatives; inadequate monitoring of company
representatives; and failure to keep proper records. Up to April 1994,
Irish Life UK had also failed to implement a satisfactory training and
competence scheme.

Lautro conceded that Irish Life, Ireland's top life insurer, remedied
these breaches quickly and fully - the life company said it was
disappointed by the reprimand, given this acknowledgement and the fact
that most of the offences were more than 12 months ago.

Of Irish Life's total premium income of more than #800 million, about
#100 million is generated in the UK.

profits for 1994 of more than 25 percent. The group's life subsidiary,
Mapfre Vida, was the main contributor to profit growth, contributing
about Pta6 billion ($4.48 million).

Mapfre Vida was listed on the Spanish exchange on December 23 1994,
after 1.2 million of its shares - 7.5 percent of share capital - were
placed at a price of Pta4,750 in a public offer exclusive to
shareholders of Corporacion Mapfre, Spain's leading insurer. The issue
was oversubscribed 4.8 times. The proceeds will be used to strengthen
Mapfre's international activities.

TRAVELERS GROUP SPREADING ITS NET

TRAVELERS GROUP has been spreading its net, recruiting the head of a
failed US investment house to two senior positions. Michael Carpenter,
who resigned his chief executive post at the faltering securities firm
of Kidder, Peabody in June, has been named an executive vice president
of business development and strategic planning at Travelers Group. He
will also take responsibility for the life and annuity businesses of
Travelers Insurance.

Carpenter left Kidder, Peabody in the wake of rising interest rates
which were deflating the bond market and an inside trading scandal
which forced Kidder's parent company, General Electric (GE), to reduce
its after-tax earnings by $210 million. Kidder Peabody went on the
auction block earlier this year and will reportedly sell most of its
business to another Wall Street securities firm, PaineWebber.

Carpenter is an interesting choice for the Travelers life post. While
he has no direct experience in insurance, he managed several company
acquisitions and buy-out deals when working for Kidders' parent
company, GE. Travelers does not currently admit to acquisition plans,
but Travelers Group president James Dimon, said the company's life
business is"expected to grow" and Carpenter said he expects "new
opportunities" from industry consolidation.

In his new positions, Carpenter will report to Robert Lipp, chief
executive of the company's insurance division, and to Sanford Weill,
Travelers Group chairman.

Based in New York, Travelers Group is the parent of the Primerica
Financial Services term insurance network, and Travelers Insurance, the
company which recently made headlines when it merged its group health
care business with Metropolitan Life's, creating MetraHealth Companies,
the largest commercial managed health care network in the US, with a
customer base of about 13 million customers (see LII 61).

IMPERIO ALLIES WITH BCP TO BID FOR BPA

IMPERIO, PORTUGAL'S largest insurer, has allied with Banco Commercial
Portugues (BCP), in a bid for the country's second- biggest bank, Banco
Portugues do Atlantico (BPA). BCP made a failed takeover bid for a 34.5
percent stake in the bank last summer.

Imperio already owns the small Banco Mello and sells the bank's
products through its network - a spokesman said that the BPA bid could
be useful in developing the insurer's allfinanz strategy, but no
details were available.

Under the terms of the tender, approved by the Ministry of Finance on
January 12, BCP is offering Esc300 billion ($1.87 billion) for BPA, or
Esc2,730 per share, considerably lower than the Esc3,000 it offered
last year.

BCP would acquire just over 50 percent of BPA's capital and Imperio the
rest of the shares sold off.

With BPA go two smaller banks it controls - Banco Commercial de Macau
and Uniao de Bancos Portugueses - as well as BPA's life insurer, BPA
Vida.

INSURERS SANGUINE ON EU

If Austria's EU membership as of January 1 means tougher competition
for the life insurance market, domestic companies seem unperturbed.
George Hamilton reports from Vienna

AUSTRIA HAS technically been open to outsiders for the past year, under
the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement, but no sweeping changes
have occurred. Over two years ago, Austrian life insurers showed no
anxiety over possible competition and nothing has happened to support a
reversal in their laid-back attitude.

Insurance regulations were redrawn last summer to conform to EEA/EU
practice, greatly liberalising the market. Any insurer registered in an
EEA/EU country may offer products in Austria, regardless of whether the
firm has an Austrian subsidiary.

Non-Austrian firms must be approved by the finance ministry's insurance
supervisory authorities before products may be sold. Nor may Austrian
agents legally offer products of non-approved insurers.

If an insurer is not approved, "please don't ask me what happens in the
case of a claim", says one Austrian insurance broker. The registration
is no problem to serious companies and is intended mainly to protect
policy purchasers and proscribe money laundering. About 30 companies
registered outside Austria have filed their intent to sell insurance
within the country - how many of these might offer life policies is not
clear.

While conditions indicate opportunities for companies new to the
Austrian life insurance market, other factors work towards maintaining
the status quo. The market is dominated by a handful of domestic
insurers or the long-established subsidiaries of Italian and German
concerns.

Helping to maintain the situation is a Sch40,000 ($3,600) "special
expense" personal tax deduction, available only against premiums paid
to Austrian insurers. Life policies, whether bought in Austria from a
domestic insurer or purchased outside the country, are subject to a 4
percent insurance tax.

Furthermore, policies written in currencies other than schilling or
Deutschmark carry an exchange rate risk - sterling and even the Ecu,
for example, have plunged against the schilling in recent years.

The threat of competition has resulted in gradual lowering of premiums
and greater policy flexibility on the part of domestic life insurers.
Policyholders in some cases may cancel policies or switch without
penalty between different life types.

New policyholders are able at any point to shift their life insurance
from annual premiums to a paid-up policy, subject to a limit placed on
the minimum paid-in premium under which this option is available.
Policy language has been greatly simplified and footnotes eliminated.

Rates by domestic insurers have been reduced gradually to more closely
meet those of potential competitors and to conform to updated actuarial
tables. Indeed, earlier last year, Wiener Allianz, member of the German
Allianz group, estimated that rates for life policies could drop by as
much as 20 per cent.

The single main factor which continues to reserve the market to
domestic insurers is the conservatism of the public, coupled with the
assumption that the generous government retirement pensions will
continue. The well-established vast network of company-tied local
agents is also a help. Few life insurers could afford to build up the
agent networks which the top half-dozen life insurers operate, each
with some 3,500-4,000 agent-employees.

This cost element admittedly contributes to higher premiums, but the
direct personal service is expected by the insured public. The agents'
cost can be spread over a number of products and services such as
claims adjustment, helping to justify the expense while supporting an
unusually high level of service.

"Austrians have a curious fascination with the subject of death, but
don't talk about it in a direct personal way," contends one observer
writing about the Austrian personality. The observation is verified by
experience of the life insurance industry, which finds it considerably
easier to sell annuities or single-premium term policies than pure life
policies with pay-out upon death.

This fact has led to considerable creativity on the part of insurers in
packaging the more traditional policies as investments rather than
insurance and in developing new products. Single-premium term
insurance, for example, was the industry sales hit last year.

On a direct basis, the local company agent can often sell life policies
in conjunction with other insurance coverage. A term life policy is a
relatively easy add-on for banks when providing personal or home loans -
 this accounts for the high life market share of Wustenrot building
society, for example, where insurance is a secondary but hardly
unimportant product.

Indeed, Austrian insurers are finding banks increasingly important
beyond their own sales networks in selling life policies. There is
cross-ownership between the number one life insurer Wiener Stadtische
Versicherung and the number one bank, Bank Austria.

The same is true of the number two in each category, Generali Leben and
Creditanstalt-Bankverein. The latter not only sells Erste Allgemeine-
Generali products but shares a joint company, CA- Generali, with the
insurer.

The CA tie has become so important to EA-Generali that it worries over
current moves to privatise the bank. German competitor Allianz is
amongst those considering a bid for a shareholding in CA - such a move
presumably would preclude further links between CA and Generali.
Generali has given notice that it would be prepared to increase its
stake in Creditanstalt before going to the expense of recreating the
sales capacity which the present bank connection offers.

Appearances would suggest considerable market potential for life
insurance. Each Austrian allegedly has about $73,000 in savings set
aside in investments of one form or another, generally in savings
accounts, often at minimal interest rates. By tapping some of this
potential, total life insurance written has been growing at an average
cumulative rate of 9 percent-10 percent, with premiums reaching $3.6
billion in 1993. Nonetheless, Gregor Kozak, spokesman for the insurance
industry, notes that "Austrians are not a particularly insurance-
friendly people. Internationally, Austria lies well behind."

No great invasion of new insurers is expected as a result of EEA/EU-
inspired entry liberalisation. As Dietrich Karner, general director of
EA-Generali observes:"The prominent insurance groups are long since
present in Austria and have carved out their market share".

Karner contends that Austria is oversupplied, relative to the number of
insurers already in the market, and that lower rates can be achieved
only at the expense of services which the Austrian policyholder
expects. Given these conditions, market entry is clearly no casual
affair. Even entry via direct mail- order, probably the least expensive
approach, offers limited opportunities.

Well-established leader in health and hospitalisation, Austria-
Collegialitat, tried a broad-brush mail-order sales programme for
health insurance several years ago with only modest success; even at
that, the firm had follow-up capabilities via its rank of agents.
Currently only the German mail-order house, Quelle, offers life
insurance by mail.

The relative complacency of the current group of 35 domestic and
international subsidiary firms offering life insurance in Austria may
be exaggerated - but the market has been fought over long enough and
hard enough that the existing insurers will not yield territory to
newcomers without a good fight.

GATEWAY TO ASIA

Australian life insurers face new challenges of stiffening regulation
and emerging Asian markets. Tess Critzer reports on the issues
preoccupying the industry

THE AUSTRALIAN life insurance market enjoys the singular distinction of
being the only European model market in its region. Ranked eleventh in
the world, it is the third-largest market in the Asia Pacific region,
surpassed in size only by Japan and South Korea.

Companies entering the Australian market, or any of the emerging Asian
markets, must be prepared to look deep and make market and cultural
allowances, argues James Cochrane, managing director of Oceanic
Holdings.

"The British designed the Australian market, and have grown with it,
and Europeans in general are used to adapting to different markets.
American companies, however, have not fared as well here. I think the
reason is that while Australia appears to be very similar to the US,
there are actually important subtle differences, and we have very
entrenched notions of how we go about doing business."

Cochrane points out that the Australian life industry is dominated by
Europeans. "It is a western economy with a consumption per capita
almost identical to the US and it has 17 million consumers. Any
overseas companies moving into the market must first recognise what
those consumers want."

Unlike in the US, both the life and non-life industries are regulated
federally. Currently, there are 41 direct insurers, employing 20,000
people, and five reinsurers, according to the Life Insurance Federation
of Australia (LIFA). About 80 percent of the life business is currently
written by ten of those 41 insurers, 22 of which are Australian-owned.

The three largest direct insurers are mutuals - Australian Mutual
Provident (AMP), the leading company, National Mutual and Colonial
Mutual. Seven of the 41 insurers are bank-owned, and three are
government-owned. Of the foreign insurers, eight are from the US and
six are of UK origin. There is one company each from the Netherlands,
Switzerland and New Zealand, as well as one Belgo-Dutch company and one
UK/Dutch venture.

As of September 1993, Australian life offices held $96 billion in
assets, up 11 percent on the previous year, more than half of which are
controlled by the three large mutuals. Indeed, the ten biggest
companies control more than 80 percent of overall assets. Overseas,
Australian life offices, located primarily in Asia and Europe, hold
assets of about $16 billion.

Career agents have traditionally been used for the distribution of
personal lines, with the industry employing an estimated 8,000 agents.
Many direct insurers, particularly the three market leaders, employ
independent or multi-agents, who sell the products of more than one
company, resulting in a strong, independent market of self-employed
agents.

The industry is facing new regulatory and operating hurdles, Cochrane
points out:

Allfinanz:"In general now in the Australian market, banks are the
winners, particularly since distribution has developed in investment
markets. The largest of these, Bankers Trust, sells investment products
and annuities, and it has the greatest share of retail funds management
in the country.

"Four years ago the three big mutual companies had about 70 percent of
premium income. That's changed now. They still have a good share of the
risk business, but bank-owned companies have undercut them on other
products.

"Banks came into their own in the Australian industry in the late
1970s, then they got into the pension fund market in the 1980s. The
banks did not replicate traditional insurance companies. Rather, they
sought to deliver life products at lower costs, and they found they
could sell insurance investment products, which enjoy preferential tax
treatment.

"Banks have the advantage of generating business through their branch
networks, and they also have access to a great deal of customer
information, so that when a customer walks into a bank and deposits a
cheque, the bank representative can cross- sell that individual,
convincing them to invest their savings in annuities or insurance
bonds.

"Australian banks have very high security, with almost no failures
whatsoever in the country's banking history. However, banks do not
guarantee their insurance products, and customers can lose a percentage
of their money without realising it. I also believe that banks should
issue disclosures of how they're managing their administrative costs.

"We've also seen the emergence of a broker market. Until recently, life
brokers were non-existent in Australia, but certain regulatory changes
have made brokerage attractive. The brokers control the group life
market in our industry, but I don't believe that commercial-strength
groups like brokers will branch out into individual products."

Regulatory Change: "The genesis of Australia's latest round of
regulations stems from the inability of the current regulations to
accommodate the needs of the country's current life products, because
in fact, 60 percent of these products did not exist when the old
regulations were written. For example, the old laws didn't even require
profit/loss statements.

"Within the next two months, a whole new raft of regulations will be
enacted in Australia, affecting company conduct as well as agent and
consumer issues. The regulations for company conduct will be fairly
standard, allowing for the establishment of an actuarial standards
board to oversee corporate control. The big difference is that
directors of life companies will owe primary allegiance to
policyholders, rather than shareholders.

"The regulations relating to agents and consumer issues are more
dynamic. The new rules will revolve around `Needs Analysis', very
similar to the British system. In other words, an insurer will not be
able to sell a policy without a complete analysis of the customer's
needs (unless a customer refuses to give out the information and
thereby signs a release).

"There will of course be a raft of regulation in regard to controlling
sales methodology. Many regulations have been introduced over the past
year and we have rules that prescribe complete illustration of fees,
charges and earnings (the regulator prescribes rates for earnings and
inflation purposes).

"Agent commissions have also been cut back significantly in recent
years, and the general requirement is to move to a flatter commission
scale and thereby lower the front-end load, although no one has yet
devised a method for making up the inevitable income loss.

"New laws will help consumers know what they're buying. For example,
the disclosure laws will help consumers recognise levels of agent bias.
Agent bias usually takes the form of commission, or other methods of
payments and benefits, and this naturally renders the agent biased in
favour of certain products. Now, agents must show their commission
bias, and the company also issues a report in conjunction with policy
issuance, informing the customer how much commission or what benefits
that agent got for selling him the product.

"Another aspect of the new regulatory proposals concerns agent quality.
At the moment, there are no qualifications other than industry
experience. However, some of the current proposals relate to agent
licensing, and movement toward greater education and improved
competency through training. In fact, steps are being taken to
establish a nationwide standard, enforced by training centres, at an
estimated cost of about A$300 (US$229.88 million) per agent.

"A much feared aspect of the new regulations relates to joint and
several liability, designed to make companies responsible for an
agent's underwriting actions. This provision would relate most
specifically to multi-agents - those who represent several companies.
It would require such agents to notify all their employer companies
when applying for a new agency, or when one of their agencies are
cancelled. This law is designed to better protect consumers from
unsuccessful or unscrupulous agents."

Costs and Profitability: "The costs of regulation are variable,
stemming from the nature of the regulation. However, it is often
difficult to balance off consumer interests against production costs.

"For example, the law now prescribes that an insurer's board of
directors must set up a compliance committee comprised of a majority of
outside, non-aligned directors who will certify that the company's
approved materials for market release comply with regulations.
Legislation prescribes that consumers can directly sue the members of
the compliance committee, so those external directors will seek to
protect themselves during their preparation and review of documents.
The result is that everything done today must be checked by a team of
lawyers. So, we turned things like advertising and promotion into
activities which need to be checked by lawyers.

"Likewise, new requirements for customer brochures have made it
virtually impossible to print out total disclosure and illustration
tables on less than 30 pages, which is driving up the costs of
advertising.

"Reduced agent commissions and other agent-related provisions have
resulted in a nearly double-digit reduction of agent numbers, industry-
wide. Many agents saw the market contracting and they got out. The more
experienced agents found renewed enthusiasm for selling risk products,
because there is no commission disclosure on a risk product unless it
has an investment element."

New Markets: Cochrane, like many other Australian life insurers, is
hopeful that Australia may become a regional centre for the
Asia/Pacific countries, along with Singapore and Hong Kong. Australia
offers a viable alternative to Asian bases because it is politically
non-aligned, he argues.

Australia has more than a century-old history of doing business in Asia
- one hundred years ago, four Asian insurers were also operating in
Australia: North China Insurance Company, Shanghai; China Traders
Insurance Company and the Canton Insurance Office, Hong Kong; and The
Straits Insurance Company, Singapore.

Today, only eight non-life Japanese companies represent Asia in
Australia. The tide is flowing the other way, with Asia the chosen area
of expansion for today's Australian insurers, according to Michael
Wansley, chairman of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu's National Insurance
Industry Group.

"Every year sees Australian insurers opening more offices in Asian
countries," says Wansley. The big three mutuals already have
capabilities in countries like Indonesia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and
the Philippines, he points out. Already 17 direct insurers based in
Australia have offices in the Asian/Pacific countries: two are in
China; eight in Hong Kong; three in Indonesia; six in Japan; two in
Malaysia; twelve in New Zealand; one in Pakistan; four in the
Philippines; eight in Singapore; two in South Korea; and three in
Taiwan.

The increasingly profitable Asian markets have"scarcely been tapped",
argues a report by LIFA, compiled by specialist writer, Florence Chong.
Australian life insurers have just begun establishing long-term,
mutually profitable relationships throughout the region.

Virtually all the Asian markets are experiencing double-digit growth
and Chong predicts that Asia will become a significant contributor to
Australia's total life revenue by the year 2000.

AMP offers a good illustration of the trend. Although it was the last
Australian company to venture into Asia, AMP estimates that about 80
percent of its income will originate in offshore European and Asian
markets by the end of the decade, as opposed to the current proportion
of 55 percent.

The strongest future growth in Asia will stem from Australia's life
sector, rather than non-life insurance, Chong forecasts. In 1992, for
example, total life insurance premiums (US$283.7 billion) were more
than double those of non-life premiums (US$110.4 billion).

Most Australian insurers in Asia seek long-term ventures with local
partners - a recent example was the agreement between Australia's MLC
Group and PT Asuransi Jiwa Simas Life, a subsidiary of the Indonesian
mega-conglomerate, Sinar Mas.

Asian companies are seeking out foreign partners in order to protect
their market share against other joint venture companies, Chong notes,
arguing that long-term thinking and market adaptation are the key
requirements for achieving success in the region.

The greatest growth potential lies in the Thai, Indonesian and Indian
markets, according to LIFA research. A ten-year growth period for Hong
Kong is predicted, and an ever-increasing demand for investment
products is forecast in Singapore. LIFA warns, however, that the China
market will not be ready for foreign entry for three years, because of
the inadequate legal framework, currently under revision by a drafting
committee.

FRENCH BANKS TURN TRADITIONAL

Allfinanz has transformed the French life market. Jean-Pierre Daniel
international development manager of French research body CREP (Centre
de Recherche sur l'Epargne et le Patrimoine) traces the stages of
development

TWENTY YEARS ago, France was from the insurance point of view a very
"continental" country - very traditional, with few innovations in
products, a widespread front-end commission system and under the firm
control of the state. Most of this has changed in the last few years
and the growing role played by banks in distribution of insurance
personal lines explains many of the changes.

We had an old tradition of bancassurance with the Assurances du Credit
Mutuel (ACM), a subsidiary of the powerful co- operative bank, which
started in 1971 to sell general insurance products through the bank
branches. It started in the Eastern part of France, close to the German
border and gradually extended its network.

Today, ACM is very strong in Alsace and present in most of the
provinces. But strangely, probably because in the first years they
limited their influence to some regions, the Credit Mutuel has not been
considered as a danger - or an example - by the other actors in the
French market.

The origin: Apart from the ACM, bancassurance started in France in the
1960s when banks decided to sell insurance products as add-ons to
banking services. They had three objectives: to improve their relations
with their customers; to protect themselves, for instance in the case
of the borrower's death; and, of course, to earn extra commission.

The most typical product of this period is a death insurance guarantee
which covers a possible deficit on the bank account and is paid to the
surviving spouse if the account is in credit. The premiums are very
small, directly debited from the bank account each month, and the
results are excellent for the bank.

The tax factor: A second phase started in the 1970s when banks decided
to sell financial products under the insurance tax system. The typical
product is a deferred-capital contract, with a duration calculated to
optimise the tax treatment. Today, this is eight years.

Often, the product is a single premium or a scheme where the customer
is totally free to pay additional premiums when he wants to. Of course,
if it's a regular premium contract, premiums are debited monthly from
the bank account.

The offer is based only on: profitability, or rate of interest paid on
the invested capital; flexibility, or freedom to pay additional
premiums or to make withdrawals; and tax advantages under French law.
Nowhere does advertising refer to classical insurance objectives, to
the protection of the family or to pension plans.

These products still exist and, indeed, represent the huge majority of
contracts at present sold by banks - the turnover of French
bancassurers is made up 90 percent of products of this generation.

From a marketing point of view, these products can be classified
according to their target market. For lower-income customers, banks
sell very simple monthly premium contracts, emphasising tax relief and
a guaranteed rate of interest. For medium-range customers, they offer
single premiums or non- compulsory premiums. And, for top-level
customers, they offer very sophisticated financial products, with an
interest rate linked to a stock exchange index, or multi-fund contracts
or contracts with guaranteed results which are very high in comparison
to what the market offers.

Changing traditions: The third stage of bancassurance started in the
1990s. It is not a substitution of one stage by another one - it's an
addition. Banks are still widely distributing deferred- capital
policies but are also selling other products.

On the life side, some subsidiaries of banks have started to sell death
insurance. Individual term insurance is under-developed in France,
mainly because the French over-estimate the protection provided by
Social Security and by the group contracts which result from collective
agreements between workers' unions and employers.

Entering this market, banks have what I would call an accounting
approach. While traditional insurers explained that a good husband and
father had to provide security for his widow and orphans, banks analyse
for the customer the financial consequences of death, aim to minimise
the effects - and remain on the financial field where they have their
legitimacy.

At the same time, banks have reduced medical requirements as much as
possible, trying to avoid delay between the time when the customer
agrees the contract and the point when the medical and administrative
department of the company officially accepts the risk. Often the sums
insured are relatively small and the acceptance of risk is made at a
very low level in the hierarchy of the bank.

The rewards: For the French banks, bancassurance is a very successful
diversification. They are selling new products and they have learned a
new business. They have earned more commission and strengthened their
relations with their customers. They have kept most of their staff -
otherwise technological evolution would have forced them to reduce the
number of employees. Indeed, the French banking industry was foreseen
as "the steel industry of tomorrow".

In France, there has been a serious debate on the profitability of
bancassurance, centring on "cannibalisation". As most of the money
invested by customers in life products was previously held in a bank
account in the same bank, the argument is that bancassurance is non-
productive for the bank.

It's a very interesting theory but it doesn't have any practical
meaning. In truth, a bank had no choice. Because of the mobility of
customers, if a bank had not adopted a bancassurance policy, its
customers would have moved to a competitor.

The market impact: Traditional insurers have not really lost anything
with the emergence of bancassurance. The products banks have sold were
not sold - at least to any great degree - by agents, brokers and direct
salesforces.

And since many customers have not realised that in purchasing one of
the investments offered by banks they have bought an insurance product,
traditional insurers still have an opportunity in the field of pension
plans, for example, where people look more to insurers.

The impact of bancassurance on products has been very important.
Changes in product design largely explain the success of this new form
of distribution: banks were forced to sell very simple contracts
because they had to convince and train their commercial networks before
convincing their customers. Where insurers were at that time selling
endowment policies, mixing savings and family protection, banks have
sold deferred capital and adopted a definitely savings-oriented
attitude.

Even today, although they sell term insurance, they separate protection
and savings. As a consequence of the banks' attitude, endowment
policies have almost disappeared from the French market.

Another effect of bancassurance on new products is that they are now
much cheaper for the buyer. As newcomers to a market, banks had to be
in some way "better" than traditional insurers. At that time the
consumer press, which is very powerful in France, carried a lot of
criticism of the front-end commission system.

The banks, to be different and because it was more suited to their
culture, offered contracts with a low cost for the customer - for
instance a 5 percent charge on each premium, with almost no additional
charges. They have also improved the transparency of the contracts. The
client can very easily see how much of the premium is really invested
in his or her name and how much is eaten up by the company in costs.

A third impact on the product results from banks' use of more financial
technology in insurance products. They have reached a very high level
of sophistication and now the French market offers all the products a
consumer might dream of.

The sale of financial products by banks under the life insurance tax
system has been very successful. Life insurance is now the most popular
investment in France - more than 50 percent of French households'
savings are invested in life products.

An interesting point may be underlined here. The surveys we carry out
at CREP show that the number of French consumers who declare that they
have bought a life insurance policy is relatively flat, at around 34
percent of households. In spite of the tremendous growth of life
insurance turnover - Fr378 billion ($70.3 billion) in 1993, up from
Fr59 billion in 1983 - this figure increases very slowly. Many of the
consumers who buy a life insurance contract in a bank are convinced
that they have made "an investment with tax advantages", but not they
have purchased a life policy.

The reason consumers are so fond of life insurance is that products are
much better and much cheaper than they were 20 years ago. There are
still"bad contracts" on the French market but as a whole quality has
improved.

In 1980, commissions and administrative costs represented 30 percent of
life insurance premiums; in 1993, they represented no more than 11
percent. This reduction is attributable to the entry of banks on to the
market. The banks' costs were lower but, most importantly, traditional
insurers have had to follow the move started by the banks, which acted
then as challengers.

The future: I would suggest two issues which French banks and their
life insurance subsidiaries are facing or may face in the near future.

In an environment of decreasing interest rates, newcomers which have a
more recent portfolio of stocks and shares, are disadvantaged. This is
the position of life insurance subsidiaries compared with traditional
insurers, which have very old and diversified portfolios of financial
assets. This will impact on the profitability of life policies. One may
ask whether the consumer will still prefer the convenience of the bank
network to a better return on investment offered by a traditional
company?

The other question arises from the fact that many consumers have
realised only that they have bought a tax-relief financial product, not
that they have agreed a life insurance policy. What will happen if the
tax system changes? The billions which have so easily switched from a
bank account to a life contract could very easily swing the other way,
switching to another product offered by the bank and leaving the life
insurance subsidiary a skeleton.

This danger explains to a certain extent the desire of some life
subsidiaries to sell products such as term insurance or general
insurance. It is the one way that these subsidiaries can have their
