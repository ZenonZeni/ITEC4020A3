RISKs of trusting e-mail <p>

From: tmplee@tis.com (Theodore M.P. Lee) <p>

Until such time as either the general population learns what to expect or
digital authentication (such as PEM) becomes widespread, I suspect we will
hear more of this kind of incident. This academic year the University of
Wisconsin started providing e-mail accounts to all students at its Madison
campus. (6,000?, maybe) The students, both technical and non-technical, are
being encouraged to use e-mail as a way of interacting with their instructors.
They access the accounts either through University-supplied machines scattered
throughout the campus or through dial-up Serial Link Protocol (SLIP)
connections. A mix of Macintosh's, PC's and other assorted workstations are
involved. <p>

Last week (note how early in the school year) a group of five students,
several from the Honors floor of one of the freshman dorms, were caught having
forged several pieces of e-mail. Most potentially damaging was a note saying
it was from the Director of Housing, to the Chancellor of the University,
David Ward; note that the previous Chancellor is now Pres.  Clinton's
Secretary of HHS, so the present Chancellor is new to the job.  The forged
message was a submission of resignation. Ward's secretary had just returned
from vacation and apparently assumed the proferred resignation was legitimate.
The secretary accepted it and started to act upon it -- it was only during the
course of that that it was discovered to be a fake. <p>

The students also sent messages purporting to be from the Chancellor to
other students asking them to pay their tuition. They also forged a message
from the Chancellor (my information doesn't say who it went to) saying he
was going to "come out of the closet" and announce it Sept. 25. <p>

The students were only caught through a combination of circumstances.  First,
since they used one of the dial-in connections there were logs of who dialed
in when. Secondly, during the course of their experiments they botched some
addresses which caused enough traffic to go to the dead-letter office that the
investigation could narrow what was happening. (It should be pointed out that
the forgery was fairly easy to accomplish using the Eudora mail client on a
Macintosh: the user has complete choice over the "from:" field of a message.) <p>

The FBI is investigating whether any federal crime was involved and,
needless-to-say, the students are likely to be expelled at the least. <p>
