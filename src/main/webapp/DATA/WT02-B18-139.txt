<h2>Clerk Division Conference </h2>
<p>The Third Biennial Clerk Division Conference will convene in
Las Vegas, Nevada, Tuesday, November 11 through Thursday,
November 13, 1997. General Session is November 11 with workshops
on November 12 and 13. Conference registration will begin Monday,
November 10. </p>
<h2>Pre-conference Workshops </h2>
<p>Pre-Conference activities will consist of a REC Site meeting
on Saturday, November 8, and the Presidents' Conference Sunday,
November 9 and Monday, November 10. </p>
<h2>Saved Grade </h2>
<p>On Friday, December 6, 1996 the APWU arbitrated for employees'
right to both saved grade and protected rate. This would be
beneficial to employees who lose saved grade by failing to bid.
This was the first case before new National Arbitrator Shyan Das. </p>
<h2>National RI 399 </h2>
<p>Jurisdictional disputes are again moving through the system.
The National RI 399 Committee met December 5, 1996. Arbitration
dates are set for February and March. </p>
<h2>Step 4 Decision; Saved Grade and 90-day Bid Restrictions: </h2>
<p>The issue in this grievance is whether employees under a 90
day bid restriction lose saved grade if the restriction prevents
them from bidding on posted assignments. </p>
<p>As full settlement, the Postal Service agrees to establish a
waiver from bidding for an employee who is in a restrictive
period. Therefore, if an employee is legitimately entitled to
saved grade and is in a bid restriction period as called for in
the collective bargaining agreement, he/she will not lose the
saved grade because of being unable to bid. (Q94C-4Q-C-96042416)

<h2>Appeal to Arbitration: </h2>
<p>On January 2, 1997, the American Postal Workers Union,
appealed the creation and subcontracting of Corporate Call
Management (CCM) to Arbitration (Q94C-4Q-C-970006472). </p>
<p>The Clerk Craft is seeking information in these areas: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Finance Clerk-Finance Station--It has been reported that
        the United States Postal Service is using the Finance
        Clerk, Level 6, to lead more than three (3) clerks. This
        is in violation of the Memo Of Understanding that created
        the position. </li>
    <li>During the Christmas season, the Postal Service allowed
        the presort houses to distribute and process mail. If any
        cities other than Denver, Salt Lake City and Phoenix have
        experienced this contract violation, please contact Bob
        Tunstall at (202) 842-4220. </li>
    <li>Automated Bidding System--Automated Bidding System is
        strictly optional to the employee. Any attempt by
        Management to unilaterally implement an Automated Bidding
        System without options to the manual system has not been
        agreed to.</li>
