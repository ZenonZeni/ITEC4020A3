<I>Will Federal Devolution Set the Stage for a State and Local
Privatization Boom in the Next U.S. Recession? (continued)</I><BR>

<P><BR>
As Congressman Gephardt has ambitions to run for president in the year 2000, it
is doubtful that the next Congress will be as left wing as the markets might
fear this autumn.  But Wall Street is apprehensive because it was surprised by
the upsurge of support for Patrick Buchanan in the Republican primaries during
early 1996.  With the unemployment rate so low, it was not prepared for such a
rapidly protectionist candidate to win the New Hampshire primary.<p>
<p>
Congressman Gephardt himself said after the early primaries that the politics
of the deficit was about to be replaced by the politics of income.  He
suggested that the Democratic Party would attempt to revive itself by focusing
on the economic insecurities and concerns about income inequality which had
helped to produce the Buchanan primary victories.  If the Democrats regain
control of Congress, they are likely to emphasize such themes in their
legislative agenda for 1997.<p>
<p>
The critics of the U.S. economy have three major complaints.  First, real wages
have been stagnant for several years.  Secondly, there is growing income
inequality on the basis of differentials in education.  Thirdly, corporations
provide excessive compensation for a few senior executives at the same time
that they are demanding pay cuts or other sacrifices from low and middle income
workers.  <p>
<p>
There is no doubt that real wage growth has slowed dramatically compared to the
growth rates which prevailed before the oil crises of the 1970's.  But it is
far from clear that hourly wages deflated by the consumer price index are a
good proxy for what is happening to total U.S. compensation.  There is
considerable evidence that the CPI now overstates inflation.  If we adjust
wages with the new measures of the CPI being developing to measure inflation
more accurately or deflators of prices being charged by U.S. companies, there
has been modest growth of real wages during the past decade, not a decline.
Many firms also offer their workers generous non-wage compensation in order to
avoid taxes, including pensions and health care.  Such benefits are now equal
to about 18% of total compensation compared to 5% in the late 1940's.<p>
<p>
There is growing income inequality based on education because new developments
in technology are forcing firms to bid up the price of educated workers
compared to people with fewer skills.  With the economy now close to full
employment, it is likely that unskilled workers will now have an opportunity to
improve their wage negotiating power because of labor scarcity in many regions.
The unemployment rate is now below 5.0% in states accounting for almost one
half of the national labor market and such a low level of unemployment has
always encouraged faster wage growth in the past.<p>
<p>
Corporations have been able to justify large compensation programs for their
executives during the 1990's because profits have boomed and share prices have
risen sharply.   The problem with the corporate sector is that only about 13%
of U.S. workers qualify for profit sharing plans while only another 3% belong
to ESOP programs (Employee Stock Ownership).  As a result, there is a weak link
in the U.S. corporate sector between employment and share ownership.  About 51
million Americans have exposure to the stock market through mutual funds,
defined contribution pension plans, and other forms of share ownership but they
do not enjoy the same preferential access to shares as senior executives in
most corporations. The perceived unfairness of this imbalance also has been
magnified  in the public mind by the fact that it is the large Fortune 500
companies which have done the most aggressive restructuring since 1980.  During
the past fifteen years, the old Fortune 500 companies have reduced their
employment from 16.5 million jobs to 11.5 million jobs despite the fact that
total U.S. employment has expanded by almost 28 million.  The high visibility
of the Fortune 500 layoffs in the media has produced a far greater sense of
insecurity among American workers than than can be justified by the economy's
overall employment performance.<p>
<p>
While the American corporate sector can be faulted for narrow stock option
programs and insensitive public relations in the way it conducts
restructurings, the fact remains that the U.S. has the most successful labor
market for job creation in the industrial world.<p>
<p>
Since 1980, the U.S. economy has created 28 million new jobs for a labor force
of 134 million and in the process absorbed 95% of all the new labor force
entrants.  About 20 million American also change their job every years.  Since
1980, the European Union has created about 14 new million jobs for a labor
force of 194 million and absorbed only about one half of the new labor force
entrants.  As a result, unemployment in continental Europe is at doubt digit
levels for the population as a whole and much higher for young people.<p>
<p>
The U.S. also enjoys great social mobility.  Among those in the bottom income
quintile twenty years ago, 29% have gone to the top income quintile, 30% to the
second and 21% have moved to the third.  The number of American households
earning over $100,000 per annum in 1994 dollars has risen from 1.0 million in
1967 and 2.7 million in 1980to over 6 million today.<p>
<p>
Most other industrial countries are deeply envious of the U.S. labor market.
In April, a German business magazine published a cover story about how Germany
should regard the U.S. economy as a role model for labor market reform.  The
cover showed a picture of Chancellor Kohl (a man who weighs well over 200
pounds) trying to squeeze into an Uncle Sam costume.  Shortly after the article
appeared, Chancellor Kohl announced several measures to encourage job creation,
including reduced payroll taxes and a proposal to abolish many expensive
government regulations on firms which employ ten workers or less.  Under the
previous law, such rules applied to firms  employing more than 5 people.  In
the U.S., by contrast, firms are not subject to many federal labor laws until
their total employment exceeds 50 workers.<p>
<p>
However envious Europe may be of the U.S. labor market, though one of the risks
poised by this autumn's election is that the voters will believe politicians
who say that it is malfunctioning.  In politics, perceptions are reality and
many Americans perceive that the U.S. economy is producing unfair outcomes by
redistributing income from the poor to the rich.<p>
<p>
The Democratic congressional leadership has announced a variety of proposals to
promote "stakeholder capitalism" and protect employment through new corporate
subsides and labor market regulations.  While such proposals are well
intentioned, the experience of Europe suggests that they would be highly
counter productive over the long-term.  They would produce a more rigid labor
market and discourage hiring without necessarily reducing wage inequality.<p>
<p>
While politicians in Washington have dominated the debate about income
inequality and social fairness, the politicians who actually have the greatest
capacity to promote a more just society in the U.S. are state and local
government politicians.  They have a major role to play because they are
responsible for the nation's educational system.  The U.S. spends about 6.5% of
its GDP on education and Washington is responsible for only about $40 billion
of the expenditures.  The only effective way to reduce income inequality in an
era rapid of technological change is to ensure that everyone has effective
access to a good education.  Yet, real education spending has been stagnant and
even declining in some states despite the growing public concern about income
inequality.  Attempts to promote more effective use of education dollars
through vouchers and other forms of school choice also have been stymied by
opposition from teachers unions.<p>
