STUDY SHOWS WEALTH MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN ATTITUDES TOWARD
RELIGION

With the exception of the poorest groups, socioeconomic status
seems to make little difference in how Europeans view the
importance of God in their lives.

A Eurobarometer study among a representative sample of the
population in the 12 countries that were members of the European
Union at the end of 1994 finds that among groups A through E1,
about one-third of respondents say God is important to them. An
equal share say God is not important in their lives. The rest are
somewhere in between.

As we have seen in earlier polls, God seems more important in the
lives of women over age 55 who are less well educated and poorer
than the rest of the population.

Among respondents whose education ended before they were age 16,
48 percent say God is very important in their lives. Among
respondents in the E3--the poorest--socioeconomic group, 56
percent say God is very important in their lives. The younger the
age group, the less likely they are to say that God is important
in their lives.

Catholicism prevails
Roman Catholicism, various Protestant religions, and Greek
Orthodox are still the main religions in Europe among those who
say they "belong" to a religion. Fundamental Muslims constitute
less than 1 percent of the total population.

In France, the United Kingdom, and Luxembourg one percent of
respondents say they belong to the Muslim religion; in the other
nine countries that were part of the European Union at the end of
1994, fewer than one percent make that claim.

One-half of those polled say they belong to the Roman Catholic
religion, with the highest shares in Portugal and Ireland (91
percent), Luxembourg (89 percent), Italy (88 percent), Spain (79
percent), Belgium (67 percent), and France (63 percent).

Nineteen percent of respondents say they belong to a Protestant
religion, with the highest rates in Denmark (72 percent), and the
United Kingdom (44 percent).

The least religious countries are The Netherlands and the eastern
part of Germany. Forty-eight percent of the Dutch say they belong
to no religion, and 69 percent of those living in east Germany
give that response. There is an even split among Catholics and
Protestants in the western part of Germany, with 40 percent saying
they are Catholic and 43 percent saying they are Protestant.
Thirteen percent do not claim a religion.

Greece is the one country which claims a religion not shared by
many others. Ninety-eight percent of respondents say they are
Greek Orthodox. Seven percent of respondents in the Netherlands
also claim that religion.

Does "belonging" mean
being "religious"?
In some countries, there is a strong correlation between belonging
to a particular religion and "seeing oneself as religious."  These
are probably the countries where religion has the most influence
over behavior.

More than 80 percent of respondents in Greece, Italy, and Portugal
say they are religious, compared with 59 percent of respondents in
the 12 countries surveyed. The highest share of those who say they
are religious is in Greece (93 percent).

In the Netherlands, where 48 percent of respondents claim no
religion, 50 percent of respondents say they see themselves are
"religious."

Atheism is highest in France, where 19 percent of respondents say
they are  atheists. Despite the fact that 63 percent of the French
say they belong to the Roman Catholic Church, only 46 percent say
they are religious.

Except for Ireland and Italy, where 12 and 7 percent of
respondents, respectively, say they attend religious services
several times a week, overall about 4 percent of Europeans say
they attend religious services several times a week.

Twenty-two percent overall say they attend once a week, with 64
percent of Irish and 35 percent of Italians saying they attend
services once a week. A recent poll by Gallup found that 42
percent of U.S. respondents said they attended services in the
previous seven days.

Thirteen percent of Europeans overall say they never attend
religious services, with the highest shares in France (21
percent), Belgium (17 percent), and the UK (16 percent.) Fully 15
percent of respondents in Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands
say they never attend religious services.

Despite the fact that 30 percent of eastern Germans say they are
atheist and 33 percent say they are nonreligious, only 9 percent
say they never attend religious services.

CZECHS ARE EUROPE'S CHAMPION BEER DRINKERS

If they gave out gold medals for beer consumption, the Czechs
would win.

In 1994, Czech breweries produced 38.34 million hectoliters of
beer. In the last quarter of 1995, production was running about 1
to 1.5 percent behind production in 1994. The 1995 estimated
annual per capita domestic consumption was 160 liters per person,
ahead of the Germans. In 1994, it was 161 liters per person.

The president of the Czech Association of Breweries, Antonin
Kratochvile, believes that the reasons for the decline in sales
this year were a cooler summer, Slovak government barriers against
the sale of Czech beer, as well as some decline in exports to the
former allies in East and Central Europe. He does not foresee
major changes in the near future and thinks that in the next three
years, domestic beer consumption should remain stable. This means
that growth in beer production and profits will depend on exports.
Kratochvile sees the most promising export potential to the
countries of East and Central Europe as well as to Russia.

In 1995, the Czech beer exports did well in the German, United
Kingdom, and U.S. markets; exports to Russia also grew.  The total
beer exports reached 1.8 million hectoliters. Foreign producers
have made little impact in the Czech market, capturing less than
one-tenth of one percent so far. This apparently has little do to
with prices. The Austrian brewery, Zwettel, offers its beer at the
price of the Czech premium beer, but well-known global brands--
such as HeinekenQ-are up to three times more expensive than local
beers.

Kratochvile does not think that domestic newcomers in the category
of larger breweries have a chance to succeed on the Czech market.
Their numbers have decreased steadily from 104 breweries in 1970
to 79 in 1980, and 71 currently. If foreign brewers want to
participate in the Czech market, he believes they will best do so
in mergers with medium-sized breweries or joint ventures.

Besides the large Czech companies there are also 14
"minibreweries," but their market share taken together is
relatively small. The ten largest breweries together claim a 49.4
percent market share.

GERMANY CONTINUES AS A STRONG CAR MARKET

Among the five largest markets in Europe, Germany was the only one
where sales value of medium-sized passenger cars grew between 1989
and 1994, according to a new report from MarketLine International.
The other growth market worldwide was the United States, which is
the world's largest market for medium passenger cars.

On the basis of a constant 1994 foreign exchange rate, the global
value of medium-sized passenger car sales declined from $194
billion in 1989 to $173.9 billion in 1994, providing an indication
of how tough the auto market has become.

The definition of medium-sized cars is different in Europe and
Japan than in the United States. In the lower-medium group in
Europe and Japan are models such as Rover 200, Renault 19, Ford
Escort, VW Golf, and Toyota Corolla.  Upper-medium cars include
Ford Mondeo, Opel Vectra, Renault Laguna, Peugeot 405, and the BMW
3 series.

In the United States the lower-medium category includes Pontiac
Grand Am, Dodge Spirit, Ford Contour, and Honda Civic. In the
upper-medium category are Honda Accord, Ford Taurus, Nissan
Maxima, and Toyota Camry.

In 1994 nearly 10.4 million medium-sized cars were registered/sold
globally, up 2.8 percent over 1993. Medium-sized car registrations
peaked in 1989 at about 11.9 million. Globally, sales of medium
cars are split almost equally between lower-medium and upper-
medium cars. The table at left shows the number of
registrations/sales of new medium-sized passenger cars in 1994, by
country.

General Motors led the market in 1994 with a 19.5 percent share of
the medium-sized passenger car market. Ford and Toyota took 11.8
percent, and 11.7 percent respectively.  The leading eight
companies account for 76.3 percent of all medium-sized car
registrations globally.

In 1994, the United States had the largest number of dealers
selling medium passenger cars (35,136) and hence the lowest number
of medium car registrations per dealer at 101. Spain has the
fewest dealers selling this size car and the highest registrations
per dealer at 227. MarketLine says this indicates the highly
focused distribution network in Spain.

The medium-car market is forecast to rise 8.7 percent globally
between 1994 and 2000, with Germany expected to overtake Japan as
the second-largest market globally. By 2000, first-time
registrations in Germany are expected to rise to 2.1 million
compared with 1.9 million for Japan. The prediction is based on a
forecast of stronger economic growth in Germany during the period.

RESIDENTS OF PRAGUE MOVE FROM BUSES TO CARS

In the first nine months of 1995, car sales in the Czech Republic
grew nearly 40 percent compared with the same time period in 1994.
In those nine months, 77,985 new cars were sold. In addition,
81,497 used cars were also sold. Both figures include new and used
cars imported from Western Europe.

The most successful car manufacturer was SEAT (the Spanish VW-
owned concern). Ford sold the most small trucks and vans. The
table on page 5 shows the top-ten manufacturers in sales in the
first nine months of 1995.

The penetration of cars in the Czech Republic has grown from 241
cars per 1,000 persons in 1991 to 287 per 1,000 in 1994. In Prague
the growth has been especially dramatic: from 283 per 1,000 in
1991 to 418 per 1,000 in 1994.

The number of people using public transport declined from 4.9
million passengers in 1991 to 4.3 million passengers in 1994, a
decrease of about 12 percent. In some other post-Communist
markets, this drop has been even more dramatic: in Hungary, 25
percent; Poland, 33 percent; and in the former East Germany, 55
percent.

EUROPEANS BELIEVE IN EATING THEIR FRUITS AND VEGGIES

Europeans are getting the message that eating habits may have
something to do with the risk of cancer. A survey by Eurobarometer
(see source, pg. 2) underscores the importance of structuring
messages for foods in a way that is compatible with cultural
context. For example, it is probably easier to promote high-fiber
products as contributing to good health in Ireland, Denmark, the
Netherlands, and Belgium than it is in other markets because
people there believe that high fiber has a good effect on cancer.

When asked the question, "For each of the following, do you think
that eating more of it increases the risk of getting cancer,
decreases it, or has no effect?," responses varied by country.

The Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Belgians are most likely to
believe that alcohol increases the risk of cancer, while the
British, Dutch, Danes, and Irish believe that the consumption of
alcoholic drinks has no effect on the risk of cancer.

Greeks, Italians, and Irish think red meat will increase the risk
of cancer, while the French, Dutch, Danes, and British do not
think it will.

Consumption of salt seems to be the most uniformly agreed-upon
risk factor, with about one-third of citizens of the European
Union seeing salt as increasing the risk of cancer. Twenty-eight
percent of people overall say sugar can increase the risk of
cancer, but 63 percent of the French and Dutch, 62 percent of
Danes, and 59 percent of the British believe it has no effect.

Green vegetables are highly rated by respondents, with 45 percent
overall believing that consumption of them will decrease the risk
of cancer. That view is most prevalent in Ireland, Denmark, and
Spain. Fresh fruit gets similarly high marks.

SIZZLE SLOWS IN THE BRITISH FAST-FOOD MARKET

In 1995, the fast-food market in the United Kingdom increased by 4
percent to GBP5.37 billion, representing about 16 percent of the
total catering market. Market Strategies for Industry (MSI)
forecasts the market to grow by 3 percent in real terms in 1996.
Increase in consumer spending and continued penetration into new
markets are the two main reasons behind the growth forecast.

MSI projects that the UK market for prepared sandwiches will reach
GBP1.92 billion when final turnovers are tallied for 1995. The
sandwich sector is expected to be one of the strongest for the
rest of the decade.  Hamburgers, however, are expected to lose
some of their sizzle for the rest of the decade; that sector's
growth is projected to decline, after about 5 percent growth
between 1994 and 1995.

Pizza and pasta were expected to grow about 3 percent each during
1995.  In the UK, these two sectors have been widely marketed with
discounts, and MSI says the value of the pizza and pasta market is
being restricted because of this marketing strategy.

Fish and chips, the British tradition, was projected to grow only
2 percent during 1995, apparently being put under pressure by the
increased choice in the fast-food market. This sector is expected
to peak in 1997 and then begin a slow decline.  The market for
fried chicken, on the other hand, increased 5 percent to about
GBP347 million in 1995, and is expected to grow at least 2 percent
in 1996.

Chinese and Indian takeaway foods are becoming slightly less
popular, according to the MSI study, increasing in real terms by
only 1 and 2 percent, respectively, which MSI says reflects an
actual decline in sales.  The market for these items is expected
to remain flat in the next year or two and to decline towards the
end of the decade.

DIRECT MARKETING SHOW FINALLY GETS A EUROPEAN CHARACTER

Database marketing and the use of electronic media are the two hot
topics in direct marketing today, not only in the United States,
but in the rest of the world as well.

International Direct Marketing Week, to be held January 24 to 26
in Paris, will give you the European perspective on these issues.

Speakers from Europe, including the managing director and the
marketing director of Germany's Bertelsmann Online, which recently
invested in America Online, will comment on topics such as
"integrating the electronic media into a commercial strategy" and
how to create business relationships via on-line.

A session on the legalities of selling and creating other
transactions on-line will also assist companies that want to sell
via new technologies but also want to respect the laws of the
countries in which they sell.

In the past, this conference and others on direct marketing have
often featured many of the speakers you would hear if you attended
a similar event in the United States. A review of the program for
this year's French event shows virtually no American speakers.
This means a better learning environment for those who are truly
trying to understand the European viewpoint. The event offers the
additional benefit of a large and active trade show, which will
quickly bring you up-to-date on direct-marketing services-Q
including listsQ-in Europe.

Fully 89 percent of U.S. corporate travel managers surveyed by
Runzheimer International say that Western Europe is a primary
business destination for their companies. Seventy-nine percent
said Canada and 75 percent said Asia. Eastern Europe was mentioned
by 57 percent.

The average cost of an international trip is about $3,485,
Runzheimer says, with airline tickets (obviously business class)
accounting for about one-half of that amount.  Hotel rooms average
$170 a night, and car rentals $56 per day.

DIRECTORY OF E. EUROPE AND CIS BUSINESSES HELPS FILL A VOID

So you want to find wholesalers for sporting goods and toys in the
Baltic countries and Eastern Europe? Other than contacting your
competitors to learn the names of their distributors, where can
you start?

One possibility is a directory that covers a wide range of SIC
codes. It's called Major Business Organizations of Eastern Europe
and the Commonwealth of Independent States 1995/96, published in
the United Kingdom by Graham and Whiteside and distributed in the
United States by Gale Research.

Turning to the index based on business activities, by country, you
will find three wholesalers of sporting and recreational goods and
toys and hobby goods in Bulgaria, one in Russia, two in Hungary,
three in Poland, and one each in Romania and Slovakia.

Turning to the actual listing for a company, you find full contact
information, bank references, the number of employees, activities,
and the names of directors and senior managers. In many cases, the
most-recent information on total sales is provided, along with the
date the business was established and the number of its employees,
two indicators of stability. If you already know the name of a
company and need additional information to find out whether it is
a legitimate business, the directory is also an excellent place to
start.

Graham and Whiteside's company directories for many regions of the
world are also available on-line through the Company Intelligence
services of Information Access Company as well as on CD-ROM.

INSURERS LIKE TO KEEP THEIR BRANDS' NAMES IN PUBLIC VIEW

One of five insurance companies in the United Kingdom says that it
would not advertise if its competitors did not do so. Yet,
companies recognize that advertising is their most important
promotional tool in a market that is growing very little and is
highly competitive.

These are some of the findings of new research on the ways that
financial companies in the United Kingdom spend their marketing
dollars.

In auto and homeowners' insurance, direct writers such as
Churchill and Direct Line are battling to attract a larger share
of a finite market. They must advertise continuously to encourage
new customers to contact them. In the life and pensions market,
150 companies are vying for the same customers and are suffering
from consumer distrust following scandals in the sales of personal
pension policies.

A survey of advertising managers in financial services by
Datamonitor found that advertising is their most important
promotional tool, but direct marketing use is expected to increase
by the year 2000. Financial services companies already account for
about 25 percent of the direct mail sent in the UK.

Datamonitor analyst Brian Evans-Jones says that even if direct
marketing increases, advertising would not die out. "Companies
still need to attract new customers before they can hit them with
mailshots. What we will see in the future is advertising and
direct marketing working in harmony: one attracting new customers,
the other dealing with them afterwards."

EDUCATION LEVELS OF EUROPEAN PRINT MEDIA READERS ARE RISING

Results of the sixth Pan-European Survey (PES6) of print media
readers in 14 European countries are in and find that one-third of
print readers now have post-graduate qualifications. The survey,
carried out by Research Services, involves more than 7,000 face-
to-face interviews in 14 countries.

Other general findings of the survey, which monitors readership
for a host of newspapers, newsmagazines, and in-flight magazines
across Europe, are that English-language use is becoming more
prevalent, that educational levels are up among readers, and that
the share of readers who work for multinational organizations is
on the decline.

Specifically, the European Union now has about 125 million
English-speakers. Among PES6 survey respondents, 68 percent use
English and 40 percent use it regularly at work. The survey also
found that 73 percent of respondents now have at least a college
degree, compared with 68 percent in the last survey.

Analysis of PES6 reported in the November issue of Media &
Marketing Europe comments on the differences between the last
survey and this one, as well as some of the problems inherent in
the survey.

BRITISH WOMEN FACE BALANCING ACT

More women are breaking through the "glass ceiling" in the United
Kingdom. At the same time, three-quarters of women still cook the
evening meal in their households. And overall, women suffer higher
levels of stress than 10 years ago.

About 15 percent of women now experience "a lot" or a "great deal"
of stress, with those aged 35 to 54 the most likely to be under
duress, according to a government study, Social Focus on Women.

The study also shows a pattern of growing financial independence
and spending power among British women, accompanied by increased
social status. Despite the positives, women in the UK are
struggling to balance their traditional family roles with growing
opportunities in the outside world.

An explosion of part-time employment has brought increased numbers
of women into the labor force. In 1994, 12 million female
residents of the UK were working. The proportion of economically
active women rose from 37 percent in 1971 to 44 percent last year.
The share of part-time work increased 19 percentage points over
the last decade, to 45 percent of the women who work. About 80
percent of women with part-time work say they do not want a full-
time job, mainly because of family commitments.

About one-half of women believe that a mother should not work
while her children are younger than school age, but about 30
percent consider part-time jobs acceptable for women with pre-
school children, and over 60 percent think they are acceptable for
women with school-age children.

Despite shifts in favor of women in the workplace, women still
have traditional roles in the UK, notwithstanding opinion polls
which show a widespread belief among both sexes that domestic
tasks should be shared.

A 1991 opinion survey cited in the report indicated that both men
and women think cooking the evening meal should be shared equally.
But when asked who actually cooks, 20 percent said that meal
preparation was jointly shared. In 9 percent of households, the
evening meal was prepared by the man. In 70 percent, the woman was
responsible.

With traditional male activities such as repairing household
equipment, 31 percent thought they should be shared equally. In
reality, 82 percent of these tasks were done by men.

Women are waiting longer to get married and to have children,
often because of increased career opportunities. The average age
for a first birth within a marriage rose from 24.8 years in 1971
to 28 years in 1993.

Having children can, however, still have a negative impact on a
woman's career. Many women who have children have less opportunity
for advancement than women who do not take career breaks to bring
up children.

THE EARNINGS GAP
Many women continue to earn less than men in comparable jobs. In
April 1994, for example, one-third of female employees earned
GBP190 (about $300) or less per week compared with 13 percent of
male employees. Conversely, three-quarters of males earned over
GBP230 per week, compared with only one-half of females.

Even so, women now have more money of their own. Almost 75 percent
carried some form of "plastic money" in 1993, with one-third
having a charge credit card.

More are taking on long-term financial responsibilities as well.
The proportion of women holding a mortgage in their own name more
than doubled between 1983 and 1994, to 17 percent, while the share
of men with their own mortgage went up only three percentage
points, to 20 percent, during the same period.

After food and housing, women are most likely to spend their money
on household goods. Compared with men, women spend more on
clothing and considerably less on motoring.

In their leisure time, women are abandoning traditional
activities. Dressmaking, knitting, and needlework, practiced by 48
percent of women 10 years ago, have declined in favor of
participation in the audio-visual revolution. Listening to
records, tapes, and CDs has increased among women from 62 percent
to 75 percent in 10 years.

Virtually all womenQ-99 percentQ-watch television at least once a
month. Satellite television is watched most by women aged 25 to
34. Soap operas, followed closely by drama series, are the most
popular TV programs among women.

Despite television's popularity, women still find time to read.
The share of women who read regularly rose from 61 percent in 1983
to 71 percent in 1994. However, women are less likely than men to
read a national newspaper--54 percent compared with 66 percent.
Instead, magazines enjoy tremendous popularity. Four of five of
the most popular weekly magazines are for women.

Women  also read men's magazines. About 200,000 read the pop music
magazine, The Face, which is aimed mainly at young men, and 30,000
women read Penthouse, which is aimed at the adult male.

About two-thirds of women went to the cinema last year. Young
women are the most regular cinema goers, with 87 percent of those
aged 15 to 24 attending once a year or more.

Alcohol plays an increasing role in women's lives. The share of
heavy drinkers has gone up, with 11 percent drinking more than the
government-set "sensible" level of 14 units of alcohol per week.
Young women aged 16 to 24 drink on average just over seven units
per week--three times more than those aged 65 and over.

Women spend, on average, more of their income on tobacco, and have
been slower to quit smoking than men.

THE ROLE OF MARRIAGE SHIFTS

Inequality among women in the United Kingdom has increased as a
result of greater access to jobs and wealth. The gap between rich
and poor women has been widened by a significant rise in numbers
of "dual earner" couples, according to two studies on incomes and
families by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

A growing number of working women now enjoy prosperity and social
status on a par with their male counterparts. On the other hand,
there is an expanding pool of single and unemployed females unable
to break into the job market. Women who maintain a household with
children are most likely to be in the lowest income bracket, while
two-earner couples are over-represented in the top brackets.

In 1981, male earnings accounted for nearly three-quarters of
total household income. By 1991, this had fallen to two-thirds. In
dual-earner families, the difference is even more marked, with
women who worked full time in 1991 bringing in an average of 42
percent of family income.

THE ROLE OF MARRIAGE CHANGES
The growth in female employment, together with the greater
availability of contraception, has brought couples closer
together, according to the Rowntree Foundation. Yet paradoxically,
there has been a substantial increase in divorce.

There is now  a greater acceptance of premarital sex and
cohabitation. Marriage is seen as a means of enshrining a
relationship rather than as a legal nicety preceding and
legitimizing parenthood.

Far from being the death knell of a traditional institution, this
shift in attitude indicates how much more is expected of marriage,
the Foundation says.

"Marriage is increasingly regarded as an evolving institution," it
concludes. "[Its] modern role is to confer public recognition on
the relationship between two adults whose parenthood may be
neither imminent nor assured."

The Foundation cites a survey which found that people in the
United Kingdom were more likely than in other European Union
countries to regard the primary role of family as "providing love
and affection," rather than "bringing up and educating children."

Marriage, however, is no longer a source of stability. Four out of
ten marriages now end in divorce in the United Kingdom, and the
number of marriages is at its lowest level in 150 years.

GERMANS SHOP FOR FRESHNESS

This is the second part of a two-part series on consumers in
Germany. The first part appeared in the December issue of
Market:Europe and included basic demographic data about the states
in Germany as well as economic, employment, and education
information. To obtain a copy of Part I, call W-Two Publications
at (607) 277-0934.

Germany's retail trade totaled DM 685 billion in 1992. Almost 90
percent of this money was spent in stores, but some DM 78 billion
were not. One out of five retail businesses was not store-based;
these businesses employed almost 10 percent of the 388,000 retail
employees.

Mail-order firms, of which there were 10,000 with about 100,000
employees, accounted for DM 40 billionQ-slightly more than one-
half of this nonstore turnover. The rest flowed through kiosks and
"nonstationary" sales locations.

One of the latter channels is open-air markets, which still play a
significant role in the life of the ever-freshness-conscious
German consumer, who goes shopping almost daily. In the large
cities, these markets are assembled at the crack of dawn on
parking lots or town squares, then moved to another location in
the early afternoon. They travel from borough to borough on a
weekly schedule and typically offer a wide variety of produce,
baked goods, meats, fish, eggs, cheeses, and the all-important
cold cuts, as well as flowers, some clothes, and perhaps baskets
or jewelry.

Another source of competition for Germany's grocery chains is an
increased number of food cooperatives. More than 2,000 are now
operating in the country. Members use their group purchasing power
to buy directly from farmers. Members sometimes work in the
business or pay a membership fee, but they get the advantage of
lower prices and fresher, often organically grown, food.

The market for organic food in Germany is about $2.1 billion, less
than 2 percent of the $176 billion that consumers spent in 1994
for food. Co-ops have a 3 to 5 percent share of the organic
market, according to data published by The Week in Germany.

Germany continues to suffer under the severely restrictive shop
closing time law which, with few exceptions, prohibits
storekeepers from keeping stores open on Saturday afternoons, all
day Sundays, and past 6:30 p.m. during the week. Consumer
dissatisfaction with this tired statute appears finally to have
reached critical mass, however, and changes are discussed ever
more forthrightly in the media and some political circles.

For the time being, the trade unions--the main proponents of
keeping the law as is--still have the upper hand, but their reign
is eroding. Methods used to dodge the regulations include
greengrocers who forget to close on time and bakers who on Sundays
sell only to club members. (As we went to press, the government
had just introduced a legislative initiative that would permit
stores to stay open till 8 p.m. on weekdays as well as on Saturday
afternoons.)

Gas stations, which are for the most part exempt from the law
because they cater to the traveling public, long ago turned into
minimarkets, with the result that, just to pay for gas, one
frequently has to stand in line behind grocery shoppers.

"Airports and train stations have turned into shopping centers
with travel opportunities," writes Stern, Germany's biggest mass
market magazine. In a representative poll, the magazine found that
30 percent of the population want the shop closing time law
stricken entirely, and another 30 percent were in favor of
liberalization. Almost two-thirds were against keeping on the
books the law that prohibits bakers from making fresh rolls on
Sundays.

Bakeries may serve as the perfect example of the unreasonableness
of the trade unions' position. Whereas they oppose a
liberalization of the closing time law ostensibly in part to
safeguard the existence of small and medium-sized enterprises,
three small bakeries go out of business every day. Apparently the
law does little to help them fight the regional superbakeries'
success. The big bakeries are also in favor of liberalization in
order to be able to compete with competitors from neighboring
countries who operate under less-restrictive conditions.

Germans are, by the way, European champions in bread consumption.
Statistically, each German eats 81 kg (178 pounds) bread per year.
Whole grain and rye breads are still predominant, but varieties of
white bread have above-average growth rates.

The recent flat retail sales climate (see Market:Europe June 1995)
shows few signs of improvement. In the first half of 1995, in
nominal terms, retail trade remained stable; in real terms, it
declined by 2 percent.

The retail woes have begun to affect store rents. Except for the
very best addresses, rents for retail space in the downtown areas
of big cities have eroded up to 5 percent, and for the first time
in years, interesting spaces are relatively freely available.

The average store rental in fine downtown locations is about DM
120 per square meter for small locales and DM 83 for large ones.
But there are regional differences and, in general, one can expect
substantially lower rents in eastern and southern towns.

Commercial rentals are, of course, most expensive in the biggest
cities. For a small store expect to pay DM 220 per square meter in
Bremen and Stuttgart, DM 300+ in Dortmund and Essen, and up to DM
400 in the best locations in (West) Berlin, Hamburg, Koln, and
Munchen. Larger storefronts rent for between DM 60 and DM 120 per
square meter less than smaller storefronts.

THE GREEN CONNECTION
Whatever you sell, the green angle is important in Germany, it
seems. Ikea, for example, advertises cups made from recycled
glass. A company called memo, "the supply house for the
environmentally conscious," provocatively asks in one of its print
ads whether the reader is an armchair culprit and offers office
supplies and furnishings "that are good for humans and nature."

Tengelmann-Qa supermarket chain which in 1984 banned turtle soup
and frog's legs from its shelves and now boycotts products from
Norway because of that country's record regarding whales-Q
pioneered the ban on detergents containing phosphates (now
nationally accepted) and declines to stock PVC beverage
containers, chlorine-bleached paper products, and one-way pens and
tableware, among other environmentally questionable products.

Pioneer Tengelmann is by no means alone. "The traditional
shopkeeper's credo, according to which trade just offers the goods
and the customer alone decides [what to buy], is losing
importance," wrote Die Zeit, Germany's most respected liberal
weekly. "Merchants want to pursue actively their role as
gatekeeper between producer and consumer."

Hertie, one of the biggest department store chains in the country
and another forerunner of green thinking, removed many nongreen
products from its salesfloor and introduced more environmentally
conscientious packaging. In cooperation with BUND, a respected
environmental organization which tested more than 300 cleaners for
this project, the retail giant introduced a collection of 38
especially environment-friendly household cleaners. Mail-order
giant Otto sells "affordable and environmentally friendly" washing
machines and television sets; competitor Neckermann offers an eco-
fridgeQin conjunction with Greenpeace.

The polling institute Emnid found that 69 percent of shoppers paid
attention to environmental issues. One in five households told the
Federal Office for the Environment that it made substantial
changes to address environmental realities. The Office found that
80 percent of the population think of themselves as
environmentally conscious, and that about two-thirds are willing
to act that wayQ-unless buying green hits the pocketbook too hard.
One in two consumers was not willing to pay more for green
products; most of the rest tolerated a premium of no more than 10
percent.

Ten years after the beginning of the eco-boom, it is no longer
that easy to differentiate a product simply by its greenness. On
the one hand, the driving forces, the consumers, are a bit weary
in face of conflicting claims and an inflation of eco-this and
eco-that, and on the other, German advertising law, which
prohibits comparisons, can make it difficult to position a product
in context. Furthermore, customers expect concrete, understandable
benefits, not fuzzy promises. To that end it is also important
that ecology-mindedness not be confined to a single product;
rather, the entire company must be credibly engaged.

Consumer Credit and Payment Methods
Seven of eight Germans do not have a credit card. One reason for
this low penetration may be that credit cards' usefulness is
limited because they are not nearly as widely accepted as they are
in some other countries. Germans also are a bit wary of the very
concept of disposable credit.

Every-day monetary transactions are made almost exclusively in
cash, and Germans pay bills usually by transfers among financial
institutions. For the payment of recurrent bills, most Germans
have placed orders for automatic deduction from their giro
transfer accounts. Besides regular banks, Postbank AG, one of the
three institutions that emerged from the breakup and privatization
of the government's monolithic Deutsche Bundespost, is a major
player in the giro transfer market.

Meanwhile, the number of bankruptcies continues its three-year
climb. The Federal Statistics Office reported 11,542 insolvencies
in the first five months of 1995, up 15.9 percent from a year
earlier. About one quarter of the total of 2,305 May 1995
bankruptcies were filed in the new Lander; the 1,725 cases in the
west meant an increase of 9.9 percent as compared with May 1994.

Similarly, the number of individuals with overdue debts has risen
by 1 million in the last three years to well over 8 million.
Delinquent debtors do not come exclusively from the socially
weaker stratum of society, but more and more doctors and
pharmacists are unable to meet their obligations, too.

TRAVEL
Are recession, high unemployment, and ever-higher paycheck
deductions finally taking a bite out of German travel habits? It
is too early to tell. Whereas a steadily growing percentage (39
percent in 1992, 40 percent in 1993, and 41 percent in 1994) of
west Germans remain at home, their eastern cousins pick up the
slack and ever-more-frequently use their still relatively new
freedom to see the world.

In 1994, 54 percent of Germans vacationed for five days or more
(1993, 55 percent), and 45 percent (46 percent in 1993) were away
from home for two weeks or more, found a B*A*T Freizeit-
Forschungsinstitut study. East Germans travel for an average of
12.9 days, and west Germans for an average 16.4 days.

One in four vacationers remained in Germany. Fifty-eight percent
of these national tourists were aged 65 and older, and 27 percent
of them were aged 14 to 29.

As always in the last 20 or so years, Spain (11 percent), Italy (8
percent), and Austria (8 percent) were the top-three international
destinations for German vacationers, together drawing more German
travelers than all national tourist destinations together.

The trend to one-person households benefits the tourist business
as, according to the B*A*T study, money that otherwise would be
spent on children, flows into travel. Fifty-six percent of
traveling families, 69 percent of vacationing couples, and 82
percent of singles with Wanderlust could afford an international
trip in 1994.

When asked about their dream destinations, almost one in two
Germans named the Caribbean. Other tropical island paradises such
as the South Sea, Bali, Java, the Maldives, and Hawaii received
frequent mentions. Australia (+12 percentage points in 1994 as
compared with 1991), the Dominican Republic (+9), and South Africa
(+6) are the newest trendy destinations, whereas Florida, Egypt,
and Russia led the pack of destinations rapidly losing attraction.
No doubt the attacks on tourists in each of these markets have
helped to dull their luster for Germans.

In the first half of 1995, overnight stays in German hotels,
motels, and guesthouses with nine or more beds were up 4 percent
as compared with the first six months of 1994. The new Lander and
east Berlin registered a hefty growth rate of 16 percent, whereas
the west saw only a 2 percent increase.

The number of overnights of national guests grew 3 percent to
123.1 million, and the number of overnights of foreigners
rebounded 5 percent to 14.7 million.

Italians (+110,000 overnights/+16 percent), Japanese (+67,000/+13
percent), and citizens of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
(+61,000/+5 percent) led all other nationals with respect to
growth rates. With +38,000/+3 percent, U.S. citizens were in sixth
position. Overnights by visitors from The Netherlands, however,
who constitute the single-largest group of visitors to Germany by
country of origin, declined by 6,500, or 0.3 percent.

Media and Advertising
Newspapers are Germany' most important advertising medium; they
attracted 31 percent (slightly more than DM 10 billion) of all
advertising spending in 1994. The 420 daily newspapers publishing
in the fourth quarter of 1994 sold over 30 million copies per
issue, two-thirds of them to subscribers. The 32 weeklies sold
more than 2 million copies each week, but saw their advertising
revenue shrink to DM 416 million (minus 7.7 percent) as compared
with 1993. Advertising spending on supplements decreased 4.8
percent to just under DM 270 million.

Magazines, which garnered 3.3 billion advertising deutschmarks in
1994 (+2.8 percent compared with a weak 1993), numbered just over
700 and sold a cumulative 123 million copies per issue in the
fourth quarter of 1994; the 963 journals sold 17.3 million copies
per issue and earned DM 2.2 billion (+1.0 percent) through
advertising. (All figures take into account only titles that are
accredited with IVW, an industry watchdog that verifies print
media distribution and, since 1994, radio and TV advertising spot
broadcasts.)

Television is the second-largest advertising medium, commanding 17
percent of the entire advertising pie. Its 1994 advertising income
was DM 5.6 billion, an increase of 16.6 percent compared with 1993
and four times as much as 10 years ago. Almost 90 percent of these
advertising deutschmarks (up from 70 percent in 1992 and 14
percent in 1988) flowed in the coffers of private TV stations.

Presently home-shopping programs are limited by law to a maximum
of one hour per channel per day, but the industry hopes that the
1996 broadcast treaty will eliminate this barrier. Home Order
Television (H.O.T.), a joint venture of a television channel and a
mail order company, began a pilot project in October, and QVC and
the Swedish Kinnevik are reportedly poised to beam their programs
into German homes.

In 1994, Germans registered 32.3 million television sets and 36.2
million radios. The fee attached to this household-based mandatory
registration finances the "public-legal" media, which until 10
years ago were the only players on German airwaves.

Of the 37.4 million reception points (households, workplaces, and
lodgings), 23.2 million (62.0 percent) were wired for cable in
1994, and 14.6 million (39.2 percent of total) were actually
hooked up to cable reception. Cable penetration was highest in the
three city Lander (Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen), where it was 55
percent and higher. Other western states averaged around 40
percent of cable hookup, while eastern Lander fell between 12 and
25 percent of reception points actually being hooked up.
(Anecdotally, it seems that everyone not hooked up has a satellite
dish on the balcony.)

One television channel's study showed that people in east and west
differed markedly in their TV-viewing habits. People aged 14 and
older in the east spent 212 minutes daily in front of the
television set compared with 183 minutes in the west. This
imbalance reverses itself as late in the day as 10:30 p.m., when
west Germans become more likely to watch than east Germans. West
Germans find information, variety and entertainment shows, and
domestic police dramas more interesting than do their eastern
cousins, whereas the latter are especially fond of game shows,
infotainment, and U.S.-made police dramas.

With DM 1.1 billion (+12.9 percent) in 1994, radio earns three
percent of the advertising deutschmark. 1994 was the first year
that private radio stations pulled in more advertising money than
the 'public-legal' stations, whose advertising income shrank 10.4
percent from a year earlier to DM 492 million (43 percent of total
advertising spending on radio). Private radio's income jumped 41
percent to DM 643 million.

Advertisers spent DM 276 million in the 3,718 movie houses in
1994, up 5.9 percent compared with 1993. Even though 1993 was a
banner year with movie ticket sales surpassing all expectations
(+23.2 percent over 1992), the number of tickets sold in 1994 was
up again to 132.8 million (+1.8 percent). Multiplex theaters are
relatively new in Germany and they are doing well at drawing
advertising. Even though there were only 13 such centers in
Germany in 1994 (another 15 to 20 are in the concrete planning
phase), they had a 13 percent share of movie house advertising
expenditures.

The age distribution of the movie-going public is as follows: 24
percent are aged 14 to 19, 47 percent are aged 20 to 29, 16
percent aged 30 to 39, and 13 percent aged 40 or older. There are
slightly more female than male moviegoers in the age groups 14 to
19 and 40 and older. The group aged 14 to 19 represents 6.9
percent of the population but constitutes 15.2 percent of
moviegoers. They are the only age group that is overrepresented.

Total investment into direct-mail advertising was estimated at DM
11.2 billion for 1994; postage alone accumulated to DM 4.5
billion. In that year Deutsche Post AG, the private successor of
the erstwhile Deutsche Bundespost, which also included what became
Deutsche Telekom AG and the aforementioned Postbank AG, delivered
4.6 billion pieces of "infomail" (mass advertising addressed to
specific patrons) and 1.9 billion pieces of "mail drop shipments"
(unaddressed material delivered to every household on the route).

Closing
Five years after unification people still have to come to grips
with the costs. For westerners these costs are real and
immediately reflected in their monetary and job security concerns;
for easterners costs include widespread unemployment and a
lingering second-class citizen status.

Enthusiasm for unification has been steadily waning in polls;
perhaps it is being replaced by acceptance of and arrangement with
reality, however.

The rugged German economy seems to weather the giant sucking sound
of the eastern vacuum, and polls consistently show that the
present federal government enjoys broad popular support. To this
reporter such voter confidence would seem to indicate that,
despite all the pains and hardships unification has brought, the
German people in the final analysis say, "We can live with thisQ
somehow." The continued strength of the deutschmark seems to
indicate that indeed they can.
