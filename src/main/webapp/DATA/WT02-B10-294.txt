<center><strong>"What do O.J., the President, Howdy Doody and Apple Computer have in common ?"
</strong></center><p>

Lately, I’m just finding it difficult to generate much enthusiasm over the news. The press seems to be covering the same subjects in boiler plate fashion, Court TV is turning into “Hard Copy” with it’s new Lawyer Vs Lawyer format (is too, is not, is too, is not.....you’re a baby, no - you’re a baby....), and “Men Behaving Badly” is giving me factual content, but no current events. I even tried to jump start a thought process by reading  “National Review” and “National Geographic” on alternate days for the past week. Flat line, get the paddles.<p>
The local Mercury News led off yesterday with 4” high headlines, “O.J. Must Pay”. I don’t care, I mean I reallllllly don’t care.  This story remains what it always has been, a story of interest for polite racists on both sides of the coin. Outside of the principles, what is the other significance? Perhaps the multi-million dollar peripheral industry that spawned as a result of a routine homicide. I didn’t know who Nicole Brown or Ron Goldman were before the murder, and I am sure I have learned nothing of factual content since. I always just thought of O.J. Simpson as a one time good running back, with a career buried under a really bad Buffalo Bill’s team. Not sure how rental car commercials and sports commentaries elevated him to the pre-murder status of a national hero or celebrity. Don’t care.<p>
The President gave his State of the Union Address - “Internet access and free money for everyone. Balance the budget, but no binding constitutional amendment. Huge tax breaks, as long as you live in poverty. Internet 2 is needed so sick children can get their homework. Minor problem of more corporations ordered to give away their products so Bill can meet his campaign promises.”. Fortunately the address was preempted by almost everything, including the WB’s sitcoms. <p>

Steve Wozniak has rejoined Apple in the role of a non-participating hood ornament, on the heels of (or in the slipstream of) Steve Jobs. Didn’t Wozniak leave Apple not long after the company’s initial climb to fame? Wasn’t Wozniak squeezed into a box, left with nothing to do by Steve Jobs, until Wozniak lost interest and left the company? Wasn’t Jobs squeezed out by Scully when Apple crossed the billion dollar threshold and the company outgrew its founders? Maybe this whole revival effort is more a function of Gil Amelio’s early basic training at Fairchild Semiconductor, where building buffer management committees was standard CYA practice.<p>

I think that Apple is suffering from “Howdy Doody” syndrome. A few years after Buffalo Bob was removed from the airwaves, there was a huge public outcry from baby boomers who were still  mourning the loss of their childhood keepsake.  One by one, the players were recalled to network duty, or Howdy Duty; Buffalo Bob, Howdy and Clarabelle. After two shows, and a lack of viewer momentum, the show’s producers went on to call back: Princes Summer Fall Winter Spring, Mr. Bluster, and Flubadub.  Two or three more shows and the network canceled. The ingredients in the original show that could not be recalled were: the innocence of the ‘50s, the lack of alternative viewing, and an audience with enough imagination to block out Howdy’s strings without the aid of special effects.<p>

Outside of the investors and employees of Apple, I believe the question of revival is “why?”.  People don't drive around in new Packards, or carry portable Osborn Computers onto airplanes, or have much of a need for another type of hardware platform. Peter Drucker, a long, long time ago, said that strategic decisions a company  made today, may not show the results of those decisions for 20 years. Apple is showing the results of several strategic decisions in a more compressed time frame. The first was when they put the lid on the original Apple and introduced the closed platform Apple III and Lisa systems, while IBM went out with the easy open IBM PC. <p>

The next point was IBM’s willingness to support clone manufacturers, while Apple sued anybody that came close to making a piece of hardware that could run Apple software. Remember the Ace ? Maybe it was just a moment of indecisiveness, when Apple couldn’t choose between evolving as a hardware company or a software company, and concluded by trying to be both. The result was they couldn’t establish market mass in hardware, or provide continual support and opportunity that software developers need to make the Apple system more useful and progressive.<p>

Then it seems like it got worse. Scully, a guy with a background in distribution and channel management, who was doing a commendable job in those respective areas, decided he would take a shot at ego product marketing, which resulted in the Scootin’ Newton. Apple planned “Newtons for everyone”.  Unfortunately, while the troops were off trying to figure out how to perfect character recognition for their little phone number keeper, they forgot to develop the MAC. Not sure how the organization didn’t hear/see the MS based system steamroller running rampant through the market place.<p>
Today the market is left with some Apple system related questions that, after a year of reorganization, are still not being addressed, and none have anything to do with price. Is an Apple faster? Is it cheaper? What can it do that an MS based system can’t do? Nostalgia will only carry a company so far, and I believe Apple is about to join Howdy Doody. <p>
