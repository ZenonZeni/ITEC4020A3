<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Major new academic study concludes that arguments in favour
of physician assisted suicide outweigh those against</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Medics supporting a change in the law outnumber those
against</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Public would prefer doctors to take the final action at
the patient's request, but doctors favour the patient taking the final
action</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>New surveys support a change in the law - a Bill proposed</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Cautious Bill with extensive safeguards</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Chris Docker of the Scottish Voluntary Euthanasia Society
said: &quot;This is the first time the subject has been examined in such
depth in the UK. We are very heartened by the results. It provides politicians
with the ammunition they need to approach such issues responsibly, and
reach a compassionate response when all palliative options have been exhausted.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>***********************************************</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Glasgow University: Glasgow University's Institute of
Law &amp; Ethics in Medicine today released the results of its year-long
intensive study into the pros and cons of the physician-assisted suicide
debate. The Report, called Sometimes a Small Victory, which is over 200
pages long, includes a thorough examination of the relevant legal, medical
and ethical dilemmas, together with two surveys that reveal current feelings
of the public at large and also within the medical profession.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Concluding that people wish to see the issues debated
and many would welcome legal change, the report includes a draft Bill which
the researchers call a &quot;legislative template&quot; for moving forward.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Highlights: The Report disagrees with the House of Lords
Select Committee on Medical Ethics, and says: &quot;...the arguments against
legislation are not of sufficient weight to tip the scales against the
arguments in favour, but they must be accorded consideration in the drafting
of any legislation which would produce change. This is no easy task, but
one which must be undertaken.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Surveys: When asked about preferred methods, 42% preferred
voluntary euthanasia and 28% assisted suicide (22% had no preference).
In a separate, postal survey of UK medical practitioners and pharmacists,
54% were in favour of a change in the law to allow physician-assisted suicide
to take place in specific circumstances, with only 36% against. 60% of
the 1000 practitioners who responded had treated a patient who was considering
suicide, 12% personally knew another health professional who had assisted
a patient to kill themselves and 4% had themselves provided the means (such
as drugs or information about lethal acts) to assist a patient to kill
themselves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One interesting finding of the second study was that most
medical practitioners found physician-assisted suicide preferable to voluntary
euthanasia (43% in comparison to 19%), especially in view of the findings
in the first study which showed the public's preference for voluntary euthanasia.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was little by way of differences in the percentages
of hospital physicians, medical GPs, surgeons or psychiatrists favouring
a change in the law - approximately 48% were in favour. This was in stark
contrast to the percentage of pharmacists in favour (72%) and anaesthetists
(56%). Pharmacists were twice as likely as medical GPs to endorse the view
that &quot;if a patient has decided to end their own life then doctors
should be allowed in law to assist.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Definitions: Assisted suicide: this is where the person
who wants to die takes their own life with the help of a doctor who provides
the means of death: i.e., a prescription for drugs. It is the action of
the person himself or herself which leads to their own death, at the time
and place of their choice. Voluntary euthanasia: this is where the person
decides they want to die and is helped to die by someone such as a doctor
or other medical staff, friends or family. It is the actions of the other
person that lead to death.</FONT></P>
