<p align="center"><b>Alaska Court Rules Roadside Marijuana Search
To Be Illegal</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 27, 1995, Anchorage, AK:</b>&nbsp;
In a ruling that could cast doubt upon the legality of many
roadside searches, Alaska District Court Judge William Fuld has
dismissed charges against a man who was arrested after a state
trooper reportedly smelled marijuana and then demanded that the
defendant &quot;hand it over.&quot;&nbsp; In the court's view,
the officer's phrase: &quot;hand it over&quot; was not a choice,
but a demand to search the defendant's vehicle.&nbsp; Therefore,
the court ruled that the roadside search was improper because no
valid consent was ever given by the defendant. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;The trooper was in uniform and the defendant testified that
he felt he had to respond to the officer's command,&quot;
summarized Fuld in his court opinion.&nbsp; &quot;The demand to
'hand it over' admitted to by the trooper was an illegal search
of the defendant.&nbsp; While the trooper smelled marijuana, he had
no right to search the passenger. ... <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">... The state argues that there was a valid consent to a
search.&nbsp; I don't think so.&nbsp; No choice was offered [to
the defendant.]&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>California Activists File Medical Marijuana
Initiative For 1996 State Ballot</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 29, 1995, Sacramento, CA:</b>&nbsp;
A coalition of AIDS activists, cancer survivors, seniors, nurses,
and medical experts have filed a medical marijuana initiative
with the California Attorney General's Office.&nbsp; The
initiative was filed in response to Governor Pete Wilson's
expected veto of bill AB 1529.&nbsp; (This legislation would
provide for the controlled compassionate use of marijuana for
those individuals diagnosed by a physician to be suffering from
the diseases of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and multiple
sclerosis.)&nbsp; Wilson previously vetoed similar bills in both
1993 and 1994. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">The initiative maintains that those patients who possess a valid
doctor's recommendation should be allowed to use marijuana as a
therapeutic without fear or risk of criminal prosecution.&nbsp;
The initiative also allows citizens to cultivate their own
marijuana for personal use and encourages state and federal
government to establish a program that will provide for a safe
and affordable method of distribution.&nbsp; This coalition has
150 days to collect 600,000 signatures. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Marijuana activist and head of Californians for Compassionate
Use, Dennis Peron, will be directing the initiative drive.&nbsp;
&quot;If Governor Wilson had not vetoed, two years in a row, two
separate medical marijuana bills--one that would have allowed
doctors to prescribe, and one to allow patients not be prosecuted
for personal use of marijuana--this would not be necessary,&quot;
he stated. <br>

<p align="center"><b>10th Circuit Appeals Court Rules Warrantless
Use Of Heat Sensing Equipment<br>
To Be Unconstitutional</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 4, 1995, Denver, CO:</b> The following
is an excerpt from a Reuters news brief: </p>

<blockquote>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    It is unconstitutional for police and drug enforcement agents
    to scan homes with heat-sensing equipment to detect criminal
    activity without a warrant, the federal appeals court in
    Denver ruled Wednesday. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The decision came in a case which law enforcement officers in
    Wyoming obtained a search warrant, and later a conviction,
    after using a thermal imager to gather evidence that
    marijuana was being grown in a home. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from a
    six state region [Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico,
    Kansas, and Oklahoma], ruled 3-0 that police must obtain a
    search warrant before using such equipment. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    &quot;We reject the government's contention that its
    technical wizardry should free it from the restraints
    mandated by the Fourth Amendment,&quot; the court said.&nbsp;
    It noted that the government denies thermal imagers intrude
    upon privacy. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">    The court said four federal appeals courts in other circuits
    have ruled the opposite way, that warrants are not needed
    before police use thermal imagers.

York Times Editorial Lashes Out At The Drug War</b> 

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>October 7, 1995, New York, NY:</b> Citing
statistics from a recently released Sentencing Project report,
The New York Times denounced the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; in a
Saturday editorial. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Noting that current data indicates that one in three black men
between the ages of 20 and 29 are involved somewhere in the
criminal justice system (either prison, pre-trial detention, on probation
or on parole), the Op-ed argues that the &quot;War on Drugs&quot;
is rounding up a &quot;disproportionate&quot; number of black
Americans.&nbsp; In support of this notion, the editorial noted
that &quot;during the early 1990's, at a time when
African-Americans accounted for only 13 percent of monthly drug
users, African-Americans were involved in 35 percent of the
arrests for drug possession, 55 percent of the convictions and 74
percent of the prison sentences. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Although the editorial never spoke out in favor of legalization,
it did assert that America &quot;need[s] to rethink both drug and
punishment policies.&quot;&nbsp; These latest figures, the Times
concluded, &quot;should set off alarm bells from the White House
to city halls--and help reverse the notion that we can
incarcerate our way out of fundamental social problems. <br>

<p align="center"><b>County Sheriff, Undercover Agents Threaten
Sandusky County NORML<br>
With Indictments</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>September 30, 1995, Fremont, OH:</b> A
September 22 weekend rally put on by the Sandusky County Chapter
of NORML has stirred up more than just controversy following an
announcement by Sheriff David Gangwer that he had undercover
agents infiltrate the event. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;I am disappointed with the actions of this sheriff,&quot;
said Sandusky County NORML Chapter President, Tomas
Salazar.&nbsp; &quot;This is a direct attack on NORML and we are
being targeted for our beliefs.&nbsp; This is a violation of our
Constitutional right to assemble.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Gangwer claims that the information and evidence gathered by his
agents will eventually be turned over to the Sandusky County
Prosecutor and state officials.&nbsp; The evidence could warrant the
need for a special grand jury to seek criminal indictments
against NORML, he added.&nbsp; Gangwer would not discuss what
charges were being considered. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;At the very least we hope the information we gathered will
prevent this from ever happening in this county or in this state
again,&quot; he said. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Don't bet on it, claims Salazar, who is already preparing to
organize another Harvest Festival next year.&nbsp; &quot;I can't
see anything that they can charge NORML with,&quot; he
contends.&nbsp; &quot;NORML has always acted responsibly in all
of their events ... and I expect there will be no
indictments.&nbsp; This is harassment.&quot;&nbsp; Salazar added
that organizers required all attendees to sign a release
affirming that they would not engage in any illegal activities
during the course of the festival.&nbsp; The release also required
attendees to indicate that they were not an undercover law
enforcement official. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We have a right to socialize and that's what we did,&quot;
Salazar concluded. &quot;We never expected the big brouhaha that
was made out of it.&quot; <br>
