<h4>October 1994<hr></h4>

<h2><a name="au">AUSTRALIA</a></h2>
<h4>New superannuation regime delayed </h4>

<p>The introduction of the superannuation industry regulatory regime has been temporarily deferred for most superannuation funds. The 28 July deadline for superannuation funds to be regulated under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act (SIS) (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9404.html#au">April 1994</a>) has caused so much difficulty that the Australian Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) has granted an extension. Funds with five or more members now have until 31 October in which to make their election to be regulated by SIS. Smaller funds have until 31 March 1995.

<p>Changes concerning three other components of the new regime have also been announced:

<p><b>Eligible roll-over funds (ERFs):</b> The benefits of members who are no longer contactable by a fund ('lost members') are to be rolled-over (or transferred) to an approved ERF. These lost member benefits are held and invested in the ERF, with the amount invested being guaranteed, until claimed by the lost member. Owing to delays in approving ERFs, private sector superannuation funds that have already elected to be regulated by SIS now have until 30 September 1994 to nominate their preferred ERF.

<p><b>Small benefit amounts protection:</b> New measures to ensure small benefit amounts (ie those under A$ 1,000) are not subject to erosion by administrative charges in excess of investment earnings have been proposed. Essentially, these will not take effect before 1 July 1995, although certain transitional provisions will come into force immediately. Relevant legislation has yet to be released.

<p><b>Superannuation Complaints Tribunal:</b> The jurisdiction of the new independent non-judicial tribunal— the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal (SCT)— has been modified. The SCT is an independent and administrative tribunal designed to resolve disputes between fund members and trustees in a fair, economical and timely manner. Its jurisdiction is, however, subject to limitation by regulations.

<p>Initially, these regulations excluded all cases involving the interpretation of medical evidence. Typically, such cases involve claims for a total and permanent disability benefit, where a trustee has determined, on the available medical evidence, that a member is not entitled to such a benefit. The Senate has recently disallowed exclusion of these cases.

<p>This issue is currently causing much debate in the industry, with ASFA(the superannuation industry fund association) lobbying the Government to seek a re-introduction of the exclusion.

<h2><a name="be">BELGIUM</a></h2> 
<h4>Part-time early retirement pension introduced</h4>

<p>This measure was formally introduced by a Royal Decree of 10 August 1994. Its purpose is to enable more people to share in the available work without companies losing the valuable experience and knowledge of long-serving employees.

<p>Full-time employees in the private sector can gain access to a part-time early retirement pension voluntarily, provided that a collective agreement exists and that they meet the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>they are aged 55 or over
<li>they have at least 25 years' service as a salaried worker, and
<li>they are entitled to unemployment allowances for their full-time occupation.
</ul>

<p>Employees who have not yet reached age 60 must be replaced by an unemployed worker. Early retirees are entitled to an unemployment allowance of BF 11,362 per month in addition to their part-time salary. They also receive an additional allowance from their employer. The combination of apart-time salary and the part-time early retirement pension means that the early retirees preserve (at least) 80% of their net earnings based on gross earnings currently capped at BF 95,575 per month.

<p>Male employees can benefit from a part-time early retirement pension until age 65, female employees until age 60. This provision is clearly sex discriminatory and is therefore in conflict with European regulations.

<h4>Ontario health insurance decision reversed</h4>

<p>The decision to exclude foreign workers and their families from health insurance coverage (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9406.html#ca">June 1994</a>) has been reversed. Foreign workers will remain eligible for provincially funded health care coverage provided that their employment documents state that they will be working in Ontario for a continuous period of at least six months. In addition, the coverage will be extended to the families (spouses and dependent children under the age of 19) of such workers, if:
<ul>
<li>the Ministry of Health receives a letter from the worker's employer confirming that the employment period is at least three years, and
<li>the worker's family is resident in Ontario.
</ul>

<p>Coverage will be backdated to 31 March 1994 (the date of the original exclusion announcement) for those foreign workers and their families who were insured before that date. A three-month waiting period without health coverage will operate for those who are working in Ontario for the first time or are returning to begin a subsequent period of employment.

<h2><a name="eu">EUROPEAN UNION</a></h2>
<h4>New 'atypicals' draft issued</h4>

<p>A revised proposal for a Directive to protect 'atypical' workers (ie part-timers and temporary staff)has been drawn up. Its main aim is to promote equal treatment between these workers and full-time, permanent staff in areas such as pay, holiday entitlement and training. The proposal is to be discussed at the next Social Affairs Council meeting in September; unanimity will be necessary if the proposal is to be adopted.

<h2><a name="it">ITALY</a></h2>

<p>The situation regarding pensions in Italy changes daily. The latest news at the time of compiling this issue of Headlines is reported below.

<h4>Details of State pension cuts due shortly</h4>

<p>Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini has repeatedly called for a rigorous re-appraisal of Italy's over-generous State pension system, whereas Labour Minister Clemente Mastella has said the Government may fall, if it tries to implement drastic cuts in pension spending in the 1995 Budget, details of which are to be announced shortly. Regardless of Minister Mastella's comments, the axe is expected to fall on pension benefits.

<p>In the meantime, the committee set up to investigate possible areas of pension cuts and methods to encourage private pension schemes is set to report soon. Further, it appears that all forthcoming renewals of collective bargaining agreements in all major sectors will include negotiation of private supplementary pension benefits.

<h4><a name="it2">15% withholding tax— go or no go?</a></h4>

<p>The 15% withholding tax on all contributions to private pension schemes became payable with effect from 1 July 1994, with the first levy due by 20 August 1994. This was accompanied by justifiable confusion, as most plan sponsors expected the effective date to be delayed until 1 January 1995. However, preliminary indications are that, using a variety of excuses, most existing schemes have temporarily delayed payment. The hope is clearly that this levy will be scrapped in order to encourage the development of private pension schemes.

<p>At the time of going to press, the latest news is that the 15% withholding tax will be further delayed to February 1995. Amidst the confusion, the question remains: '15% withholding tax— go or no go?'

<h2><a name="jp">JAPAN</a></h2>
<h4>Turtle against crane</h4>

<p>Japan Airlines— JAL, whose logo is a crane— recently announced a plan to hire several hundred flight stewardesses on one-year contracts, renewable for up to three years. These would have replaced natural attrition leavers, employed on regular permanent terms, and would have provided a lead to other major firms looking for ways to ease their burgeoning labour costs under Japan's seniority-based, expensive employment system.

<p>But JAL scrapped its plan almost immediately after Mr Kamei— whose name means turtle, and who is the new Minister of Transportation— objected, and threatened adverse consequences if his warning was ignored.

<p>Clearly, this is a case of unwarranted Government interference in the private sector, and has left many industrial leaders concerned about the true intentions on deregulation and reduction in administrative 'guidance'. If the private sector is not free to develop innovative and creative solutions to the current economic recession, what chance for recovery?

<h4><a name="jp2">Restructuring under way</a></h4>

<p>A Tokyo Shoko Research survey of 825 manufacturing firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange revealed that 54.6% (451 firms) had reduced their labour costs in the 12-month period from April 1993 to March 1994. The annual savings of US$ 3.8 billion were obtained from a variety of measures, including plant closures, natural attrition, expense reduction, pay restraint and so on.

<p>Car manufacturers led the field with five in the top ten. Nissan was first, reducing costs by US$ 259 million, followed by Mazda with US$ 219 million in savings.

<p>Of the other 45.4% whose labour costs did not reduce, the main reason was mergers and acquisitions pushing up their total labour costs (but not necessarily the per unit cost of sales or output).

<h4>Social security changes proposed</h4>

<p>The new left-right coalition cabinet of Labour PvdA, Liberal VVD and centre-left D66 parties has announced drastic changes to the social security system:
<ul>
<li>workers' disability and sickness insurance schemes are to be privatised with premiums varying from company to company.
<li>workers will only qualify for full unemployment benefit if they have worked for four of the five years prior to losing their job.
<li>the State pension benefits (AOW and AWW) will only be adjusted to 50% of the increase in wages. 
<li>the eligibility of the general Survivor's Pension Act will be restricted by the introduction of a means test.
</ul>

<p>These proposals would save Dfl 5.8 billion from the social security budget over the next four years. Relevant legislation will be submitted to Parliament for approval.

<h2><a name="nd">NORDIC COUNTRIES</a></h2>
<h4>EU referendums ahead</h4>

<p>Having applied for membership of the European Union, the Nordic countries (Finland, Norway and Sweden) will now hold non-mandatory referendums in which all citizens will have the opportunity to vote for or against membership. The referendums are scheduled as follows:
<ul>
<li>Finland— 16 October
<li>Sweden— 13 November
<li>Norway— 28 November.
</ul>

<p>The Nordic countries have been bound by EU legislation and Directives, including those relating to pay and benefits, since the formation of the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1993 but, if they achieve full membership of the EU, the consequences will go far beyond the EEA agreement. For example, the Nordic tradition of regulating a number of remuneration and benefit issues by means of nationwide collective agreements could come under pressure; conversely, the strong Nordic labour law regulations could exert an influence on existing EU members.

<h2><a name="se">SWEDEN</a></h2>
<h4>Pay-for-performance gains ground</h4>

<p>The Swedish tradition of paying blue-collar workers a fixed hourly wage together with, in some cases, profit-share may have begun to change. Collective agreements have opened the way for companies or entire industry sectors to design new pay systems that include an element of pay-for-performance. A new agreement signed by the Employers' Association of Swedish Earth Moving Contractors identifies four components that may be included in future pay systems for such workers:
<ul>
<li>basic (based on formal education etc)
<li>competence (professional skills, additional responsibilities)
<li>performance (how well the job is done),and
<li>profit-sharing (a group-based annual incentive plan).
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, individual companies are also beginning to introduce an element of performance-based pay for their blue-collar workers. For example, the Swedish subsidiary of Nestlé has recently reviewed its pay arrangements in order to create a link between salary and individual performance.

<h2><a name="uk">UNITED KINGDOM</a></h2>
<h4>Maternity rights improved further</h4>

<p>Two new pieces of legislation that improve maternity rights have been introduced. Employers should therefore:
<ul>
<li>check the circumstances of employees currently on maternity leave or about to start maternity leave for new rights and leave provisions.
<li>review retirement plan documents for maternity provisions.
<li>review administration procedures to ensure that the correct retirement plan rights accrue during periods of paid maternity leave.
<li>ensure employee contributions are deducted at the correct amounts.
<li>ensure that insurance policies cover the 14 weeks of statutory maternity leave and periods of paid maternity leave and that other contractual benefits are continued.
<li>review current practices and policies to ensure that these are achieving their objectives.
The two pieces of legislation are:
<li>Schedule 5 to the Social Security Act 1989 (SSA89) which introduces new maternity leave provisions from 23 June 1994, and
<li>the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 (TURERA) which implements the relevant EU Directive (see <i>Headlines</i> of <a href="9406.html#uk">June 1994</a>) and grants additional maternity rights to women expecting a baby on or after 16 October 1994.
</ul>
<p>The interaction between these two pieces of legislation is unclear and creates many areas of uncertainty. However, in summary, the legislation means that:
<ul>
<li>all women expecting babies on or after 16 October 1994 must be provided with 14 weeks' statutory maternity leave.
<li>with few exceptions, retirement benefit cover must continue during all periods of maternity leave based on the pay the employee would have received had she been at work in her normal job.
<li>cover is not required for periods of maternity leave outside the 14 weeks' statutory leave where the woman is not receiving any 'pay'(although neither Act gives a clear definition of this).
<li>during paid maternity leave, employee contributions to the retirement plan can be collected in accordance with plan rules but based on the pay actually received. 
<li>other benefits such as life cover, PHI and medical benefits must be maintained during maternity leave.

<h2><a name="us">UNITED STATES</a></h2>
<h4>Merit budgets dip to 20-year lows</h4>

<p>Reflecting employers' continuing cautiousness about the prospects for economic growth, budgets for 1994 merit pay increases in US companies dropped below the 4% level for the first time in approximately 20 years, a new Towers Perrin survey shows. Other trends noted in the survey— such as the growing use of lump sum payments in lieu of merit increases and the continuing move to variable pay programmes— also point to employers' focus on managing remuneration costs. More than 1,500 employers participated in the survey, representing 50 industry groups with sales ranging from less than US$ 100 million to more than US$ 100 billion.

<p>The survey confirms that US employers are increasingly using performance-based variable pay programmes for employees below the executive level. More than a third (35%) of the respondents offer variable pay opportunities to non-executive employees, and just over half of these companies extend such opportunities to all non-executive employees. Group and team incentives are the most common variable pay approaches among the organisations surveyed, followed by gain-sharing, non-qualified profit-sharing and broad-based stock option programmes.

<h4><a name="us2">Proposal would require added pension disclosures</a></h4>

<p>Pension funds that hold derivative financial instruments (eg futures, forward, swap or options contracts) would face added disclosure requirements under a new accounting rule proposed recently by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The proposal would require disclosures about the amount, nature and terms of derivatives held during the year.

<p>The required disclosures would be more extensive for derivatives held for trading purposes than for those used as a hedging mechanism. Since pension funds' use of derivatives in many cases would fall under the FASB's definition of instruments held for trading purposes, many plans could face added disclosure and audit burdens— and possibly added administrative costs— under the proposed rule. If adopted by the FASB later this year, the new rule would take effect for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 1994 (one year later for entities with less than US$ 150 million in assets).
