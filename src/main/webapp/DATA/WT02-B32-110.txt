Richard Worzel is a Canadian futurist whose recently published book, "Facing the Future", charts a course to a future that is both exciting and scary.  He will answer these questions, and many others that have to do with Canada's future.  An expert futurist's forecasts are not guesses - they are based on hard facts and years of research.  And Richard Worzel is an expert.  Twenty years ago, he predicted that the economy in the 90's would be a global one.  He wrote about the enormous impact that the baby boomers would have on the economy.  He predicted the widespread use of voice-activated mechanisms and pen-operated computers.  Worzel answers the questions that will be crucial to your future.  There are seven principal forces at work in the world that are shaping our lives and futures:  the global economy;  population;  technology;  environmentalism and the earth's ecology;  greater human longevity; the decline of the nation - state;  and the shattering of society, and the isolation of the individual.<p>

The near future is going to be very different from the recent past, and those who are unprepared for it are courting disaster.  In this keynote presentation, Richard Worzel outlines the major forces that are shaping your world, your job, and your daily life.  He knows what the future holds in store for Canadians.  And by keeping up with this information, you will gain the edge needed to thrive in the new century.<p>
