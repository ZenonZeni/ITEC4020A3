<B>Hydrogen Use in Internal Combustion Engines;<br>

<P>

Our approach is to combine an experimental effort at SNL with the 
computational work 

of our collaborators in a first-principles approach to maximizing 
thermal efficiency.  Initially, we 

will use an indicated thermal efficiency to determine our progress.  
Later, our work will focus on 

maximizing brake thermal efficiency in collaboration with an industrial 
partner.

<P>

To reduce NO<sub>x</sub> emissions, we are operating at a low 
equivalence ratio (0.4 or less).  

To maximize efficiency at these conditions, the cylinder inlet flow 
conditions and combustion 

chamber shape will be designed to minimize heat transfer while 
maintaining robust and rapid 

combustion.  We will also examine the effect of the number of ignition 
points.

The Perkins engine is producing data.  We measured the indicated

thermal efficiency for MBT operation at various speeds with an

equivalence ratio of about 0.4.  We also compiled data for the

Onan engine for similar operating conditions.  The results indicate

that the Perkins configuration has improved the indicated efficiency,

as expected.  Of interest is the fact that the Perkins dependence

on speed is less than that for the Onan.  The broad speed range

may allow operation of the engine at various power levels with

little efficiency penalty.  There may be an advantage, with respect

to friction reduction, to a slower turning engine, and there may

be room for improvement in the absolute efficiency by adjusting

the inlet flow generated turbulence.  The burn durations of the

Perkins data are shorter than those of the Onan, in spite of the

larger displacement and single spark plug.  This suggests that

the swirl level in the Perkins may be higher than optimum

<P>

The experimental results obtained at Sandia for the Onan engine

have been used to generate an engine performance map.  Fuel octane

ratings for hydrogen, methane and a mixture of hydrogen/methane

have been predicted using a chemical kinetic model and compared

to experimental data.  The Perkins engine is producing

high-quality data.  And the modeling of the turbulent hydrogen

combustion is continuing.  Results indicate that a modification

of a standard simplified hydrocarbon turbulent combustion model

may be successful.
