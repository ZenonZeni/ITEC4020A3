This monograph explains who moves, why people cross national borders,

and how migration flows are likely to evolve in the decades ahead.

 We then look at international migration through two prisms: 

first by region, examining, in turn, migration issues in North

America, Europe, and Asia, and then by type of migrant--refugees

and asylum seekers, guest workers, and illegal aliens.

<P>

Instead of building ever-higher walls to keep migrants out, many

rich countries would like to stop immigration by accelerating

economic growth and reducing wars and human rights violations

so that people would not want to cross national borders.  We explore

the migration-reducing potential of trade, aid and intervention

policies, and ask whether industrial nations can and should coordinate

their immigration and assistance policies.

Migration Challenge</A></H1>


<P>

Migration is the movement of people from one place to another.

 Migration is as old as humankind wandering in search of food,

but international migration is a relatively recent development--it

was only in the 20th century that the system of nation-states,

passports, and visas developed to regulate the flow of people

across borders. 

<P>

Today, there are 185 members of the United Nations, and each has

a system of passports to distinguish citizens and foreigners,

border controls, and policies toward the immigration and integration

of foreigners.  Most migration policies discourage immigration--most

countries do not anticipate the arrival of foreigners who wish

to settle and become naturalized citizens.  Many nations also

discourage emigration--the Communist nations until 1989 did their

best to prevent citizens from leaving the former USSR, East Germany,

and Romania.

<P>

Migration is a result of differences --differences in resources

and jobs, in demographic growth, and in security and human rights.

 These differences are widening, thus increasing potential migration.

 For example, according to World Bank calculations, the gap between

average incomes in the richest and poorest countries was about

11 to 1 in 1870, 38 to 1 in 1960, and 52 to 1 in 1985 (World Bank,

1995, 9), but today there is no country that will accept practically

all migrants who arrive, as North and South America did a century

ago.

<P>

Given these large and growing differences, how many people migrate

across borders?  The best estimates are that there are about 125

million persons living outside their country of citizenship, meaning

that about two percent of the world's population are legal or

illegal immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers, or migrant workers.

<P>

This nation of migrants was estimated to be about 100 million

strong in the late 1980s.  It rose by 25 percent in the 1990s

both because people moved across borders--migration--and because

borders moved across people, as occurred when the Soviet Union

broke up, and Russians found themselves in a &quot;foreign country,&quot;

even though they did not move.  It is important to remember that

some individuals become &quot;foreigners&quot; even though they

do not move. 

<P>

There are several ways to think about this &quot;nation of migrants.&quot;

 First, the nation of migrants is equivalent in size to the world's

eighth most populous nation, Japan, and is growing faster than

world population growth..  In several Middle Eastern nations,

foreigners are over half of the population or labor force, and

many nations formed from the ex-USSR have more than 25 percent

non-nationals.  Some countries, including Canada, Switzerland,

and Australia, have 15 to 25 percent foreign-born persons in their

populations. 

<P>

Second, many of the world's migrants are moving from relatively

fast-growing and therefore &quot;young&quot; developing nations

to aging societies that may resist the changes that accompany

immigration.   A society's &quot;demographic need&quot; for immigrants

may be the opposite of its willingness to accept them.

<P>

Third, there is no &quot;natural&quot; end in sight to the current

wave of migrants.  Uneven population growth, economic disparities,

and war and persecution are likely to continue to produce migrants

and refugees for the foreseeable future, and most observers believe

that the number of opportunity- and refugee-seeking migrants will

increase rather than decrease in the 21st century.  Paul Kennedy,

the Yale historian, flatly predicts that &quot;enhanced efforts

to control immigration... are unlikely to succeed...(Kennedy,

1993, 45).

<P>

On the other hand, those who emphasize that migration is a manageable

challenge for the industrial democracies begin with the observation

that the world's &quot;nation of migrants&quot; involves two percent,

not 20 percent, of the world's population, <I>despite </I>demographic,

economic, and other differences that might be expected to produce

a world on the move.  In other words, most people stay in their

country of birth, despite more borders to cross, and more incentives

to cross them.  

<P>

For example, the world's major country of emigration, Mexico,

has about 100 million people currently alive born within its borders,

and over 90 percent of them still live in their country of birth

despite massive legal and illegal Mexican migration to the United

States.  The world's second leading country of emigration, the

Philippines, includes over 90 percent of the 70 million persons

born within its borders.

<P>

Furthermore, countries can implement policies that control immigration.

 Germany's 1993 asylum reforms were apparently able to reduce

by two-thirds the number of asylum applicants in that country

without offsetting increases in illegal immigration.

<P>

But there is uncertainty and skepticism about the long-term effectiveness

of such control measures as the differences that motivate migration

widen.  The US, for example, thought in the late 1980s that illegal

immigration was under control, and that the economic boom that

was creating millions of jobs would persist, so the US increased

the number of immigration slots both to unify families and to

fill vacant jobs.  These assumptions have proven false, prompting

another round of immigration reforms in 1995 aimed at reducing

legal and illegal immigration.

<P>

The migration challenge in the world&#146;s immigration nations

has two faces, one external and one internal.  The external challenge

is how to deal with the millions of people who would like to immigrate

to take advantage of the opportunities offered for economic betterment

and political freedom.  The internal or integration challenge

is how to help immigrants and their children who are living in

immigration countries to be accepted as fellow citizens and future

leaders.

INTRODUCTION

<P>

The United States is engaged in a historic experiment:  more foreigners

are arriving to settle than ever before&#151;about 3,000 per day--and

the world's major country of immigration is unsure about how to

respond.  There are two extreme positions.  Organizations such

as Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) argue that

too many people are coming in, and they call for a moratorium

on immigration to allow recent arrivals and Americans to adjust

to each other.  At the other extreme, the Wall Street Journal

advocates a constitutional amendment that would state that &quot;there

shall be  open borders.&quot;  Immigration promises to be a major

demographic, economic, and political issue in the United States

at the end of the 20th century, as it was at its beginning.

<P>

This is not the first time that the world's &quot;huddled masses&quot;

have arrived on American shores, nor is it the first time that

there has been a controversy about whether to pull up the gangplank

or to open the immigration door wider.  Americans have always

been of two minds about immigration.  On the one hand, the United

States is proud to be a &quot;nation of immigrants&quot;, celebrating

the theme of national renewal and rebirth embodied in the story

of newcomers starting over in the land of opportunity.  On the

other hand, Americans have worried since the days of the founding

fathers about the economic, political, and cultural effects of

newcomers.  These concerns have been reflected in legislation

that limits the annual entry of immigrants, and by a preference

for those who have relatives here or possess needed skills.

<P>

The debate between restrictionists&#151;who want to reduce immigration&#151;and

admissionists&#151;who want to maintain or increase current immigration

flows&#151;promises to heat up in the 1990s for three reasons.

 First, the number of immigrants is rising. Immigration has once

again become a major contributor to population growth:  about

40 percent of U.S. population growth is now due to the immigration

of about a million newcomers per year; they represent the equivalent

of adding a Dallas or Detroit annually.

<P>

Second, today's immigrants are differ from  the American citizenry

in their ethnic origins and in their education and skills.  While

earlier waves of immigrants were mostly Europeans, today&#146;s

immigrants are primarily from Latin American and Asian countries.

 Most people of the United States (and most other industrial countries)

are  in the middle class, resulting in a diamond-shaped pattern

of skills and incomes.  Today's immigrants, by contrast, tend

to be  bunched near the extremes of the education and income spectrum:

whether professionals <I>or</I>  unskilled workers, they tend

to reinforce other factors promoting economic inequality.

<P>

Third, there is no consensus among politicians, researchers, or

Americans on whether the immigrants arriving today will be social

and economic assets or liabilities tomorrow.  The tendency of

immigrants who arrived in the 1950s and 1960s to earn more than

similar Americans within two decades, and the remarkable success

of some immigrants in business and education, can be read to suggest

that the nation will reap a windfall from today's immigration,

while other income, employment, and public assistance data can

be interpreted to suggest that through immigration the United

States may be adding directly and indirectly to its underclass.


<P>

Economic issues are not the only area in which the effects of

immigrants are disputed.  Should immigrants be allowed to vote

before they become U.S. citizens?  Does immigration result in

a melting pot amalgam of American and immigrant values, or is

America a salad bowl in which ethnic identity is be maintained?

 Many immigrants do not speak English.  Are they learning the

common language fast enough?

<P>

Immigration raises three fundamental questions:  how many, from

where, and in what status should newcomers be admitted to the

United States?  Until after World War I, the United States took

in almost all the immigrants who could get to American shores.

 It remains the nation most open to immigrants--accepting about

half of the world&#146;s immigrants--but immigration is now restricted

through a complex system that favors foreigners who have relatives

here or special skills.  

<P>

This monograph explains U.S. immigration patterns and policies.

 After summarizing trends in the 1980s, we turn to explanations

for why people migrate, and outline what can be done to reduce

migratory pressures.  The four waves of immigrants that comprise

U.S. immigration history are reviewed, as are U.S. legislative

responses to immigrant numbers and characteristics.  Immigration

raises both economic and socio-political issues, and some of the

major ones debated today are examined.  We then turn to other

countries:  why are immigrants streaming into Western Europe?

 Will Japan and other Asian nations also become destinations for

immigrants?  

<P>

 Immigration promises to be one of the most important issues for

the United Sates as the 21st Century approaches.  Newcomers raise

difficult questions.  Who are we?  What kind of a society have

we built, and whom shall we welcome to it?  What should we do

to integrate newcomers and how should we deal with those who arrive

uninvited?
