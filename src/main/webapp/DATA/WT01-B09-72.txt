<B>Project Title: Project Sunrise<p>
Performing Organization: Solectria</B>

<P><B>Project Goals and Technologies</B></P>

<P>Solectria Corporation is a small electric vehicle and component manufacturer based near Boston, MA.
The company has sold over 200 electric vehicles, both 4 passenger sedans called the Force and light duty
pick up trucks called E­10's. The company in its t year history has produced drive systems with proven
reliability for solar and electric racing vehicles, for OEM electric vehicle programs, and for its ground up
design vehicle called the Sunrise. All Solectria vehicles including the Sunrise feature Solectria drive
systems which collectively have logged well over l ,000,000 miles of on­road experience.</P> 

<P>Sunrisc is a sleek. all composite, monocoque electric vehicle It is a ground up design based on the
premise of creating a safe, affordable, high efficiency, lightweight electric sedan. Its roomy interior offers
passenger space close to the of a Ford Taurus. Its exterior utilizes a very aerodynamic tear drop shape
with a low coefficient of drag. Rite Sunrise's lightweight/cight design and advanced drive system will offer a
fleet and family electric vehicle with exceptional range at a reasonable cost. </P>

<P>Solectria designed the vehicle from initial concepts to working sketches to computer models to clay
models and then mock­ups before the first body was made. over the first year of the program, master
shapes were developed and initial tooling was made followed by a rolling and then a drivable prototype.
The vehicle wave first unveiled at the EVS-12 show at Disneyland in Los Angeles, CA on December It,
1994. Since EVS­ l 2* more bodies and prototype vehicles have been produced. </P>

<P>The Sunrise development teats has selected and tested specific composite materials to achieve both
structural requirements and cost effective manufacturing in low volumes. This proprietary mix of materials
and processes is the core of the body development area of the Sunrise program.</P>

<P>Advanced vehicle systems designed specifically for EVs have also been incorporated into the Sunrise
design. A low cost­air cooled AC induction drive system, a flexible battery tunnel design, passenger and
battery ventilation systems, and an advanced battery thermal management system are just some of the
innovations that are featured m the vehicle.</P>

<P>The Sunrise has proven itself by demonstrating exceptional range both on the road and in dynamometer
testing. At the 1995 American Tour de Sol race, the Sunrise equipped with Ovonic Nickel Metal Hydride
batteries traveled over 238 miles on a single charge in mixed city ant highway driving. And in recent SAE 1634 profile testing, the Sunrise with Ovonic Nickel Metal Hydride batteries traveled 199.5 miles on a single charge.</P>

<P>The Sunrise safety program has also achieved numerous milestones. Extensive modeling and actual front
end testing has shown consistent, predictable results. In late 1995, an engineering prototype vehicle was
subjected to a full vehicle 30 mph frontal impact test at an accredited facility. All passenger injury scores
were extremely low­­ significantly less than 50% of the maximum guidelines.</P>

<P>Funding for the development of Sunrisc has come through the US Department of Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (ARPA) coordinated by the Northeast Alternative Vehicle Consortium (NAVC).
Sunrise is being developed with the assistance of many key industry and academic partners including
TPI, Textron, Boston Edison Company and the University of Massachusetts-Lowell. </P>

<P>The development program is continuing with the current design for manufacturing phase along with
continuation of the FMVSS test program. Systems are being refined to meet the manufacturable Cost
goals while still maintaining aggressive weight targets. Limited production is targeted for 1998­1999.</P>

<P><B>Solectria Electronics</B></P>

<P>Solectria has been developing advanced, high efficiency, lightweight electric vehicle
drive systems and components since 1989. These components have been placed in actual
on­road applications for well over 1,000,000 miles in over 200 vehicles built by Solectria. In
addtion, vehicles built by other large and small companies, as well as university teams etc.
have successfully put electric and hybrid electric vehicles on the road almost exclusively
using Solectria components.
</P>

<P>
ARPA's support has allowed Solectria to concentrate on innovative, low cost driven EV
electronics and drive system products to the point where they are ready for
commercialization. These component projects have been selected and executed because
they represent a significant contribution to Me technological and economic feasibility of
electnc and hybrid electric vehicles.
