<h1>THE OPIUM MONOPOLY </h1>

<p><b>BY ELLEN N. LA MOTTE</b> </p>

<h2>VI --OPIUM IN SIAM</h2>

<hr>

<p>BANGKOK, Siam, January, 1917- Siam, an independent kingdom. As
a matter of fact, &quot;protected&quot; very sternly and
thoroughly by Great Britain and France, so that its
&quot;independence&quot; would about cover an oyster cracker.
However, it is doubtless protected &quot;benevolently&quot; for
what protectorate is anything but benevolent? The more rigorous
the protectorate, the more benevolent its character. The Peace
Conference seems to have given us a new word in
&quot;mandatory.&quot; We do not know as yet what adjective will
be found to qualify mandatory, but it will doubtless be fitting
and indicative of idealism-of sorts. Therefore, all will be well.
Our suspicions will be lulled. It is high time that a substitute
was found for &quot;benevolent protectorate.&quot; </p>

<p>The particular form of benevolence noted in Siam was the total
inability of the Siamese to exclude British opium. They are
allowed, by the benevolent powers, to impose an import duty on
all commodities imported except opium. That is free. The treaty
between Siam and Great Britain in 1856 says so. We rather fancy
that Great Britain had more to say about this in 1856 than Siam
but maybe not. Anyway poor old Siam, an independent kingdom, is
bound to receive as much opium as may be imported, and is quite
powerless, by the terms of this treaty, to enact laws to exclude
it. In the last year or two, the Government of Siam has been
obliged to put the opium traffic under government control, in
order to minimize the worst evils in connection with it, although
to restrict and regulate an evil is a poor substitute for the
ability to abolish it. </p>

<p>All this, you will see, is rather tough on the Siamese, but
good business for the British Empire. </p>

<p>However, opium is not bad for one. There are plenty of people
to testify to that. We Americans have a curious notion to the
contrary, but then, we Americans are so hysterical and gullible.
An Englishman whom we met in Bangkok told me that opium was not
only harmless, but actually beneficial. He said once that he was
traveling through the jungle, into the interior somewhere. He had
quite a train of coolies with him, carrying himself and his
baggage through the dense forests. By nightfall, he found his
coolies terribly exhausted with the long march. But he was in a
hurry to press on, so, as he expressed it, he gave each of them a
&quot;shot&quot; of morphia, whereupon all traces of fatigue
vanished. They forgot the pain of their weary arms and legs and
were thus enabled to walk all night. He said that morphia
certainly knocked a lot of work out of men-you might say, doubled
their capacity for endurance. </p>

<p>The night we left Bangkok, we got aboard the boat at about
nine in the evening. The hatch was open, and we looked into the
hold upon a crowd of coolies who had been loading sacks of rice
aboard the ship. There they lay upon the rice sacks, two or three
dozen of them, all smoking opium. Two coolies to a lamp. I rather
wondered that a lamp did not upset and set the boat on fire, but
they are made of heavy glass, with wide bottoms, so that the
chances of overturning them are slight. So we leaned over the
open hatch, looking down at these little fellows, resting and
recuperating themselves after their work, refreshing themselves
for the labor of the morrow. </p>

<p>Opium is wonderful, come to think of it. But why, since it is
so beneficial and so profitable, confine it to the downtrodden
races of the world? Why limit it to the despised races, who have
not sense enough to govern themselves anyway? </p>

<p>The following figures are taken from the Statistical Year
Books for the Kingdom of Siam: </p>

<p>Foreign trade and navigation of the port of Bangkok, imports
of opium: </p>

<p>1911-12 1,270 chests of opium </p>

<p>1912-13 1,775 </p>

<p>1913-14 1,186 </p>

<p>1 914-15 2,000 Imported from India and Singapore. </p>

<p>1915-16 2,000 </p>

<p>1916-17 1,100 </p>

<p>1917-18 1,850 </p>

<p>Also, from the same source, we find the number of retail opium
shops: </p>

<p>1912-13 2,985 </p>

<p>1913-14 3,075 </p>

<p>1914-15 3,132 </p>

<p>1915-16 3,104 </p>

<p>1916-17 3,111<br>
