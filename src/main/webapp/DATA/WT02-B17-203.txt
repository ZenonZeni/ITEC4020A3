<H3><a name="transformer">Transformer Project Team Will Test Unit in 
1996</a></H3>

<P>

The next generation of advanced power transformers is being developed by 
a 

vertically-integrated research and development team.  The team members 
include:  

Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC), Waukesha Electric Systems 
(WES, 

formerly the transformer division of MagneTek), Rochester Gas and 
Electric 

(RG&ampE), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL).  The team plans to 
begin 

testing a 1-MVA single phase demonstration unit in late 1996. 

<P>

The HTS transformer will provide lower operating losses and potentially 
lower 

total owning cost than today's equipment and will provide the nation's 

electric utilities and their customers with power transformers with 
reduced 

environmental hazards, enhanced fire safety, smaller size, and reduced 
noise 

and weight.  Because electricity typically passes through four to five 

transformers between the generating station and the consumer, the energy 


savings impact of these advanced transformers can be multiplied several 
times 

when the technology becomes widespread.

<P>

Success of the program depends on the availability of low-cost, 

high-temperature superconducting wires. IGC and ORNL have been 
developing 

several families of HTS wires for electric power applications.  

The overall project is being led by IGC. IGC is responsible for 
producing all 

of the superconducting tapes and for winding the coils, and is leading 
the 

cryogenic integration tasking for the 1-MVA demonstration transformer. 
IGC 

also leads technical and economic feasibility analyses for the 10-MVA 
and 

larger class of superconducting transformer.  They will perform detailed 


design, fabrication, and testing of the 1-MVA conductor and coil and 
have the 

lead responsibility for cryomagnetic technology and manufacturing in 

partnership with WES.

<P>

ORNL is a team leader for the project and has the majority of the 

responsibility for the development and testing of components during the 
second 

year of the project.   ORNL will analyze fault tolerance of the proposed 
winding 

concepts and will measure and analyze alternating current losses as a 
function 

of normal and fault transfer operation.  ORNL also will design the basic 


conductor winding systems and will design and test certain cryogenic 

components as well as assemble and perform the first cryogenic tests on 
the 

1-MVA demonstration unit. 

<P>

WES has the technical lead responsibility for transformer design, 
technical 

and economic feasibility analyses, manufacturing, and testing.  They 
will 

conduct technical and market analysis of 10-MVA and larger HTS 
transformers.  

They also will perform strategic analyses and experiments relative to 
voltage 

breakdown. WES will lead the construction of the 1-MVA demonstration 
unit and 

will perform detailed design and fabrication of core, bushings, 
insulation, 

and mechanical structure of the 1-MVA demonstration unit.  They will 
perform 

systems-level testing at their facilities in Waukesha, Wisconsin. 

<P>

RG&ampE assists Waukesha Electric Systems in scoping, cost, and market 
analysis 

and conceptual design of the 10-MVA and larger HTS transformers.  
RG&ampE also 

applies experience gained in substation operation to assure that the 
next 

generation transformer will meet customer expectations for performance, 
total 

owning cost, reliability, and maintainability.  For more information on 
this 

project, contact Bob Hawsey of ORNL, 423-574-8057.
