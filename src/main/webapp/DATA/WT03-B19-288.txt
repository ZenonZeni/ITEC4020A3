Wangaratta is the service centre of North-East Victoria. The
city is the location of diverse manufacturing, processing and
agribusiness.  It is an important commercial centre and houses
many offices of the three levels of government.  Tourism is important
to the regional economy, and is based on spectacular attractions.
<P>
Wine production is the single most significant food processing
industry in the district.  Thousands of hectares are devoted to it, 
and contract grape growing benefits
other regions.  The sector is supported by strong chemical and
farm machinery businesses.

<H2>Quality</H2>

<P>
<img src="gifs2/wang1.gif" align=right>
The district's culture of quality management stems from loyal
corporate citizens such as IBM Australia, Bruck Textiles, Australian
Country Spinners, Brown Brothers Wines and Stanley Tools.  Wangaratta
quietly claims it is the quality capital of Australia for service,
product and efficiency.
<P>
This work ethos has not been lost on Australian Defence Industries
(ADI), which has constructed a $160m ammunition plant near Benalla.
<P>
Local government supports and drives economic development in the
district. From world class services to Australia's leading Jazz
Festival, Wangaratta displays strong commitment to future growth.
The Wangaratta Regional Development Corporation's mission is to
maximise economic development by the creation and retention of
employment'.
<H2>Companies are corporate assets</H2>

<P>
Put simply, jobs mean growth, and the district regards its companies
as corporate assets to be nurtured and developed.  Providing quality
water supply, gas, electricity, trade waste treatment and an efficient
transport network have been strong ongoing commitments by local
authorities.
<P>
The Wangaratta Airport is the largest regional airport in Victoria.
It is owned, operated and maintained by the City of Wangaratta.
Corporate jets use the tarmac and terminal frequently.  This
illustrates the positive cooperative approach to assisting corporations
to simply do business.
<P>
Serviced industrial estates have been developed in Wangaratta
by Council and private investors.  Land for any enterprise can
be arranged.  Offensive trade-zoned land is appropriately located
away from the urban area, two kilometres north of Wangaratta City
near the main gas line and waste treatment processes.
<P>
Current market price for serviced industrial land ranges between
$15 and $18 per square metre.  Municipal rates within the district
are among the lowest in Victoria.
<H2>Good living</H2>

<P>
Liveability is the catch cry of urban populations in the 1990s.
 Wangaratta offers a lifestyle that cannot be surpassed in Victoria.
 Low unemployment can be attributed in part to a strong community
spirit unmatched in capital cities.
<P>
The community supports employment and training programs, and service
organisations improve the quality of their citizens' lives.  Public
amenities and sporting and medical facilities are excellent in
Wangaratta.
<H2>Education</H2>

<P>
Education is well provided from primary school to Bachelor's Degree
level at the La Trobe University and Wangaratta College of TAFE.
Secondary and Further Education is equal to anywhere in Australia.
The district has twenty-seven primary schools, three secondary
colleges, a College of Adult Education and a Group Training Organisation
for apprenticeships and traineeships.
<H2>Retail and commercial centre</H2>

<P>
The Wangaratta City business precinct has been completely renovated
and redeveloped.  Streetscape works ensure that Wangaratta
remains the retail and commercial centre of the district into
the 21st century.The Wangaratta and District Base Hospital and
Healthscope Private Hospital provide 230 acute-care beds and ancillary
medical services to the district.  Specialist care is available
locally, across all disciplines, including rehabilitation and invalid
care.
<P>
Future directions for the district go beyond conventional business
attraction.  Much development is expected to evolve around existing
industry sectors.  Computer
manufacture (IBM), food processing (Mackay Casings), wool processing
(Australian Country Spinners), fabric and clothing (Bruck Textiles
and Yakka), and horticulture (tobacco, fruit and vegetables) are
among the local growth industries of the future.
<H2>Export focus</H2>

<P>
Processing and value adding of regional produce is targeted at
export markets.  Links have been established intemationally, especially
with South-east Asia, by existing local enterprises.  These are
being further expanded by the Wangaratta Regional Development
Corporation and Business Victoria.
<P>
A good example of a company capitalising on Wangaratta's advantages
is Dominance Timber Industries' plans
to establish a $60 million manufacturing plant.  The plant
will produce medium density fibreboard for the furniture industry,
the majority of which will be exported.  With factory construction
underway, production is expected to begin
in 1996.  Approximately 200 employees are required in
the construction phase, and 100 will be employed in operating
the factory.
<P>
Wangaratta's transport links provide a conduit for exports.  Several
major international tourist developments are currently being undertaken,
and inbound tourism will increase substantially.  The developments
include hotels, conference centres and the National Sport Aviation
Centre.  Wangaratta Airport is the site for the annual Australian
Sport Aviation Competition and other world championship events.
<P>
Established annual major events such as the Jazz Festival, Country
Music Festival, jet-sprint boat racing, arts and crafts festivals
and many sporting events greatly benefit the regional economy.
<P>
Wangaratta and District is a leader in economic development initiatives
in Australia, widely recognised for innovation and commitment
to future growth over the long term.
