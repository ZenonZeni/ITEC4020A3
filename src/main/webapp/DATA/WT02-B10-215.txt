During 1994, department members provided more than 86 hours of weekly activity group programming to improve individual patients' ability to function more independently in their various life roles.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The department added three new staff members during the year. Elaine Toskos, M.A., O.T.R./L and Ana Maria Loaiza, B.S., O.T./L joined the staff of the Intensive Care Unit, bringing the number of Occupational Therapy staff members on the unit to three. Lauren Roth, B.S., O.T.R./L, a Senior Occupational Therapist, joined the staff of the Audubon Clinic Continuing Treatment Program. Ms. Roth initiated a therapeutic community outreach activity in which several of her clients taught table games to clients of a nearby geriatric center. The program was successful in promoting the development of social skills in both populations and in increasing the self esteem of the psychiatric clients.

On the Schizophrenia Research Unit, Jodi Carlson, M.S., O.T.R./L initiated data collection for her clinical research study, "Effectiveness of Social Skills Training of Schizophrenic Patients." She also developed a second research study, "Sensory Integration Treatment of Schizophrenia," with Scott Clark, M.D. Ms. Carlson began two new groups, Power Walking, which provides patients with low impact exercise to improve physical health and expand leisure interests, and Let's Move!, a sensorimotor group which is designed to improve patients' ability to attend to their surroundings and increase adaptive motor responses.

Elaine Mullen, M.S., O.T.R./L continued to coordinate expansion of the activities program on the Intensive Care Unit, increasing the number of groups to more than 40 per week, with all disciplines assisting in group leadership. Bette Gifford, A.S., C.O.T.A./L added two new groups on the ICU-Sewing, a group designed to improve patients' task skills and to enhance their creative expression through structured sewing projects, and Memory Group, a group which utilized games requiring attention, memory, concentration, and decision making to improve patients' cognitive functioning. Jose Ortiz, A.S., C.O.T.A./L, led Shopping and Cooking groups to promote the development of independent shopping and meal preparation skills in patients of the ICU. His Shopping group included instruction in unit pricing and reading of food labels in order to improve patients' budgeting skills and compliance with special diets after discharge.

On the General Clinical Research Service, Barbara Bouley, M.A., O.T.R./L, C.S.W. began a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Group based on Dr. Marsha Linehan's model of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. This group provided psychoeducation in four skill areas-mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance-to help patients with borderline personality disorder improve their behavioral coping skills.
