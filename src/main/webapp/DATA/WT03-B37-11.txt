PARENTAL CELL DAMAGE MAY BE LINKED TO ALPHA RADIATION
EXPOSURE

The possibility that exposure to ionizing alpha radiation may damage
descendent human cells could help explain the "Gardner Phenomena,"
in which cases of children's leukemia are believed to have been
caused by father's employment at a British nuclear facility.
Scientists now have some reason to believe alpha radiation emitted
by radon and plutonium may be responsible for those chromosomal
abberations.

These findings, however, are extremely controversial because they
challenge traditional knowledge and involve scientists leaping from
one biological principle to another in order to make their case.

The scientists examining alpha radiation and its effects linked
leukemia among children to their fathers, who worked at a nuclear
fuel reprocessing plant. Research data indicate increased risk of
leukemia (six to eight times) in the offspring of fathers receiving
total radiation does of 100 millisieverts or greater prior to
conception.

From examining the results of laboratory tests, the researchers
believe they have found an unexpected mechanism associated with
alpha radiation -- chromosomal abberations which occur in an
apparently random fashion -- in descendent cells. The chromosomal
abberations shed new light on the potential damage alpha radiation
may cause.

"If a comparable phenomena could be demonstrated in spermatogonial
(sperm forming) stem cells," says researcher Eric Wright, "then it
is possible that a similar abberation could arise in sperm.

"Whilst our experiments don't actually address the Gardner
Phenomena," Wright says, "they do offer a biological mechanism
worth thinking about if you are going to take the alleged paternal
transmission of radiation damage seriously."  Wright is research
leader at the British Medical Research Council's Radiobiology Unit.

ADVISORY BOARD CRITICIZES EPA WATER GUIDELINES

Guidelines created by the U.S. EPA to assist public water utilities
dispose of wastes created during the radionuclide removal process
need more work, according to EPA's own Science Advisory Board
(SAB). The SAB Radiation Advisory Committee says it's worried
EPA's non-binding guidelines will "by default ... become the
standard."

According to committeeman Richard G. Sextro, in the absence of
"specific" federal regulations, EPA's guidelines for removing
radioactive wastes from treated drinking water will be viewed as a
standard and cause states to spend billions of dollars to comply.
Greg Helms of EPA's Office of Ground Water says the agency doesn't
have authority to "require" anything specific regarding disposal of
treated ground water waste.

A 27-member California congressional delegation says it disagrees
with EPA's proposed radon in water rule. In a letter to President
Bush, the group called EPA's proposed rule "very stringent and
costly," adding that the $3.7 billion compliance price tag will only
reduce "on average, about one percent of the public's total exposure
to radon according to EPA's Science Advisory Board." California
representatives asked Bush to direct EPA Administrator William
Reilly to conduct a full multi-media risk assessment in order to
produce a comprehensive cost effective radon reduction program for
the U.S.

The delegates also asked Bush to direct EPA to adopt a radon in
drinking water standard consistent with the goals of the Indoor
Radon Abatement Act of 1988.

ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT RADON TESTING AND MITIGATION

Recently I spoke at a radon meeting sponsored by the National Civic
League. A number of county health officials and neighborhood housing
groups were in attendance. The meetingTs purpose was to develop a
radon action plan designed to reach local communities. But, it
became clear early in the meeting that neither of these groups had a
very good grasp of basic radon fundamentals, nor were they
convinced there was a radon problem in their area.

I'm sure they aren't much different than any average American. Yes,
they've heard of radon, but radon is a problem in someone else's
home or neighborhood, not in their's.

EPA has been trying since 1988 to convince the public radon is a
serious health threat. Their efforts have probably made them feel
much like the "boy who cried wolf" because nobody seems to be
paying attention. Government officials have known the danger of
radon exposure for many years. In fact, in the early 1940's the U.S.
Public Health Service warned the Atomic Energy Commission about
radon and its threat to uranium miners. Unfortunately, the
Commission chose to ignore the warnings, and as taxpayers, we are
now compensating the miners' families for their exposure.

As you may know, radon didn't make headlines until it became a
"crisis" in the home of Stanley Watras. He and his family were
forced to vacate their house until their radon problem could be
corrected. When you stop to think about it, radon is still that way in
the majority of homes. Until someone moves, there is no radon
crisis, even if they know it is there!

My company has tested thousands of homes for radon. But more-
often-than-not, when home owners learn they have elevated levels
they usually don't take any action to lower their exposure. Initially
they might be concerned enough to start calling local "experts" until
they find someone who will calm their fears and tell them not to
worry. It seems the only time radon indeed becomes a crisis which
leads to action is when it comes time to sell a home. When sellers
become buyers, however, they are far more likely to insist on low
radon levels. Ironic? Perhaps. But, it's not such a bad situation,
because two houses get fixed as a result of the original transaction.

Radon isn't really much different than other health-related issues.
We generally don't do anything until we are forced to do so. Doctors
tell us we must lower our cholesterol, quit smoking, loose weight,
etc. or we may face the possibility of premature death. Look at the
change AIDS has brought to our society due to the tremendous fear
generated by public information. EPA took a lot of heat last year
over their public service ad campaign. The sad thing is the most
severe criticism of the campaign was due to a set of billboards
declaring "Radon is a Severe Risk in this Area" showing an X-Ray of
a pair of lungs. Some who saw the ads said they were "scared" the
visability of the ads would lower their property values. They could
care less, it seems, about the health risk radon poses.

I'm not a health physicist, but I do review a lot of scientific
information about radon that seems to validate the old adage "where
there is smoke, there is fire." Some researchers now believe radon
exposure may cause damage to genes that prevent tumors. Others
report possible links to leukemia, cancer of the liver, breast and
brain. I know there are those who will read these words and respond
with "show me the bodies." Although that evidence may be provided
in the future, until it is, we will just have to "smell the smoke."

When I was a small child, I can remember seeing ads with doctors
advertising Lucky Strikes and Chesterfields. When scientists began
raising the possibility that cigarette smoking might cause lung
cancer, other experts derided their research saying "prove it." But I
ask, where are those critics now?

The funny thing about radon is that the actions of one lawyer may be
saving more lives than the efforts of all health professionals
combined. Several years ago, Dick Mansfield, chief attorney for the
Employee Relocation Council, began evaluating environmental
pollutants. He issued a white paper in the late 1980's advising all
members of the relocation industry to test homes for radon before
taking them into inventory. He has since been criticized for that
decision but remains resolute in his position. Even though his
direction was designed to protect corporations against future
liability, the end result is that he may be responsible for saving
thousands of lives over the next decade or two. Ironic, isn't it, but
then again, pioneers always seem to get arrows in their backs.

NEW LANDAUER RELO PROGRAM RAISES MANY QUESTIONS

Despite less than favorable sales of radon detectors over the past
several years, Glenwood, Illinois-based Landauer, Inc. has reason to
be excited about radon. The AMEX-listed corporation recently rolled
out a new testing and mitigation program designed to help relocation
companies reduce administrative costs while increasing Landauer's
share of the radon detector market. According to company brochures,
the program would take the "corporation, relocation company,
transferee and real estate agent out of the testing and mitigation
process."

Landauer calls their new relocation marketing scheme the Home
Buyer's Preferred Radon Protection Program. It is a novel idea with
potential. In fact, at first glance, I'm sure it sounds very attractive
to relocation administrators, many of which are already
overburdened by increasing environmental concerns.

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS

The Landauer plan is sold as a service agreement provided by the
corporation or relocation company to the buyer at closing. After
closing is completed, Landauer sends the buyer a RADTRAK( alpha
track detector (manufactured by Landauer), which the buyer deploys
in the home, removing and returning it to Landauer after 120 days.
Landauer analyzes the device and provides results to the buyer, now
the owner of the home.

If levels of radon gas of 4 pCi/l or higher are detected by Landauer,
the home will be mitigated by a Landauer selected mitigator at no
cost to the buyer or relocation company. Landauer provides for post-
mitigation testing "to confirm the radon concentration has been
reduced to below 4 pCi/l."

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

Company brochures tout Landauer's RADTRAK long-term  alpha track
detector as the type of test kit "recommended by the EPA," adding
that short-term tests "may produce a false positive or negative
resulting in unneccessary mitigation, or worse, an undetected health
hazard."

Landauer ought to know a lot about "false" test results. Remember
the Landauer Quick Screen( detector? That device, also touted by
the company as reliable, was sold all over the United States to an
unknown number of consumers and yet never managed to pass EPA
proficiency tests. In fact, according to officials with the company,
Landauer never bothered to alert those consumers who relied on the
Quick Screen that their test results might not be accurate. Some
states, like Pennsylvania, ordered the device off retail shelves and
out of the state.

In addition, Landauer's ability to provide accurate results have been
called into question once again. According to the EPA, the company's
most recent attempt to pass their alpha track detector through the
RMP failed. According to EPA staffers, Landauer has been "delisted"
from the U.S. EPA's RMP program for failing to pass the latest round
of blind tests. Will Landauer fail to notify recent RADTRAK
customers as well?

SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE

Although Landauer's program seems to be a great potential money-
maker for the company and its stockholders, it deserves scrutiny by
the radon and relocation industries.

For starters, it is commonly believed that the soon-to-be-released
"Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon" will not "recommend"
long-term test devices, but rather, short-term tests, when testing
is performed as a result of a real property transfer. As a major
player in the industry, Landauer  should have planned their marketing
materials to reflect this.

Second, Landauer shouldn't be in the radon business if they can't
meet EPA proficiency standards. That's just asking for trouble. And
not just for the company, but for the entire radon and relocation
industries. Negative media coverage of radon service companies like
Landauer, who fail to meet EPA criteria, yet continue to offer
services to the public, can damage the credibility of the entire radon
industry, giving the public another reason not to test or mitigate.

Third, Landauer's plan, although perfectly legal, leaves its
customers open to intense scrutiny, and perhaps, liability. Although
Landauer's Brett Ladda describes the program as "no different than
going to the doctor" (Landauer provides the test, analyzes it,
remediates if necessary and then provides a confirmatory test and
results, similar to physicians who both examine patients and
prescribe treatment), the plan does not provide enough details to be
attractive to the relocation industry. For instance, who will audit
the test results? How can homeowners be assured that Landauer
devices will detect radon without a confirmatory reading from an
independent firm of their choice? What does Landauer know about
mitigation? What experience do they have mitigating homes? How
will they ensure their "network" of mitigation contractors will
actually do the job right -- and that their work will meet EPA
standards? And, perhaps more importantly, do they guarantee their
work?

A GOOD IDEA, BUT POORLY PLANNED

Although the concept of the Landauer plan is not such a bad idea
from a consumer savings point of view, choosing Landauer for
anything radon-related could be a mistake for a corporation or
relocation company. It's a public relations disaster waiting to
happen. For instance, if one of Landauer's RADTRAK detectors were
discovered to have performed poorly, the media would first point to
Landauer as "the fox guarding the henhouse," comparing the
company's service agreements with those currently under fire
between physicians, insurance companies and home health care
providers.

Good reporters would then do a "history" of Landauer, pointing out
the company's size, revenues, other business dealings,  the Quick
Screen fiasco and the company's current delisting. Landauer and its
clients would be portrayed in a negative light.

The way I see it, Landauer has two options. One -- Landauer could
stop pretending to be a radon service company.  After passing EPA
proficiency tests, Landauer could begin making improvements to its
plan to make it more marketable.

Two -- Landauer could drop out of the radon testing and mitigation
industry altogether.  The companyTs error-ladden radon efforts are
nothing but a liability. Its past record speaks for itself. Today,
Landauer is still attempting to sell its new testing and mitigation
plan to a fictional corporate America . They call the plan "the no
hassles solution to radon" -- as if hassles top the corporate
relocation gripe list. In the real world of radon and relocation,
liability is of more concern. And, liability concerns can only be put
to rest when all environmental defects have been disclosed. Without
addressing disclosure, the Landauer plan falls short of "preferred"
and offers little "protection" to anyone.

DOW CORNING HALTS SALE OF "FIRE STOP"

Dow Corning recently withdrew its "Fire Stop Intumescent Wrap
Strip 2002" from the market. Recent testing of the wrap strip
revealed what the company calls "some performance limitations"
which develop as the product ages.

Dow Corning says it will no longer sell the product and advises
contractors and suppliers to return all unused wrap strip for
replacement. The company is looking into whether or not retrofits
will be necessary "in homes where Dow Corning Wrap Strip
previously had been installed."

BOWSER-MORNER OPENS NEW CALIBRATION FACILITY

Bowser-Morner, Inc., an independent, accredited testing facility in
Dayton, Ohio, has opened a commercial radon calibration laboratory
the company says is identical to the chambers used by the U.S. EPA
in size, air flow, temperature, humidity controls, radon source,
monitoring methods and equipment.

The lab's quality assurance program features periodic data
comparisons with both EPA environmental laboratories in
Montgomery, Alabama and Las Vegas, Nevada; and the Department of
Energy's Environmental Measurements Laboratory in New York.

Editor's Note: Commercialcalibration facilities calibrate
measurement devices for radon service providers. The quality of
calibrations conducted for radon service providers affects the
accuracy of radon measurement results provided to consumers

ATTORNEYS SAY IAQ LITIGATION GROWING FAST

According to attorneys interviewed by Indoor Air Quality Update
(IAQU), the courts have seen a tremendous increase in indoor air
quality (IAQ) lawsuits. The attorneys say as plaintiffs' interest in
IAQ lawsuits rise, so too will the interest and attention of the
design and construction industries.

Attorneys interviewed by the monthly trade journal say that
although many past lawsuits have centered around residential
pollutants, the focus is now shifting. In the future, they predict,
more and more IAQ lawsuits will center on commerical, industrial
and multi-family residential properties.

Building designers, construction contractors and building operators,
attorneys say, should ensure the safety of their tenants by testing
for the presence of all possible known contaminants and routinely
inspecting HVAC systems for problems.

Frank Cross, author of "Legal Responses to Indoor Air Pollution"
says, "Most building managers are hesitant to do this, in part,
because they may not want to know, and in part because they don't
want to unnecessarily alarm their tenants. "But if they want to
avoid future litigation," Cross told IAQU, "this (testing and HVAC
inspections) could make a big difference."

FAMILY PET MAY BE "WATCH DOG" FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

Man's best friend might also be his best doctor. "The family dog and
other pets can be ideal sentinels of health hazards in your
environment," says researcher Dr. Lawrence T. Glickman of Purdue
University's School of Veternary Medicine. "Now, for the first time,
a state health department is considering using animals to help
identify human diseases caused by environmental factors, in hopes
of spotting health problems before they happen or diagnosing them
when they do."

North Carolina is considering such a system, following a May
conference at which Glickman and other public-health experts
explored the possibility.

Glickman and Dr. Ralph C. Richardson, also of the Purdue School of
Veternary Medicine, say using animals as health sentinels has
several advantages.

"Pets are ideal health sentinels because they intimately share the
same environment as their owners and often eat the same things,"
says Glickman, an epidemiologist and head of the Department of
Veternary Pathobiology.

Richardson, professor of small animal medicine and oncology and
head of Purdue's Department of Veternary Clinical Sciences, says,
"Dogs acquire diseases sooner because of their shorter lifespans.
This gives us a chance to perhaps figure out why a disease develops,
thereby allowing owners to take preventative measures for
themselves and for the other animals in the environment."

Two years ago Glickman chaired the National Academy of Sciences'
Committee on   Animals as Monitors of Environmental Hazards,
which reviewed and evaluated the usefulness of animal studies in
assessing health risks for people.

The committee found that although many scientists view animal
sentinels as valuable indicators of environmental hazards, the
approach has not been widely accepted. Part of the reason, Glickman
says, is that such studies rely on epidemiology as the basic tool, and
that the science is relatively new. Epidemiology is the study of how
disease develops and spreads into a population.

Another reason, Glickman says, is that many government funding
agencies are unaware of the value of such animal studies. "But I
hope that the report might help legitimize this approach," he says.

The committee published its report last summer. One of the group's
recommendations was to require the reporting of environmentally
caused animal diseases to appropriate state or federal agencies,
which would allow the data collected to be shared with public health
officials.

"It's done for infectious diseases like rabies, so it just makes sense
to do it for something like bladder cancer, which can affect people,
too," Glickman notes.

The report also recommended making the best use of animal-
exposure and disease record systems via computer not only for
companion animals and livestock, but also fish and wildlife. In
addition, the report noted more and more veternary and biological
sciences schools are offering courses and graduate programs in
epidemiology, with an  emphasis on environmental health.

Glickman has done several animal-sentinel studies, including one on
breast cancer and diet in dogs. Another study linked bladder cancer
in dogs to owners' using flea and tick dips on the animals and living
near areas sprayed with insecticides.

Glickman also is part of a Purdue study of dogs to assess their
owners' exposure to radon gas in the home. The first phase of the
research involved attaching radon detection collars to about 30 pet
dogs in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, to measure home radon levels.
Phase one has been completed and researchers hope to obtain funding
for phase two, which will compare radon levels in homes of dogs
with lung cancer and a control group without cancer from the same
neighborhood.

Purdue's Comparative Oncology Program, which seeks novel and
effective ways to treat animals afflicated with cancer, includes a
tumorregistry of tissue samples suspected of being cancerous.
The programTs most recent work on animals as human health
sentinels found owners of dogs with cancer used 2, 4-D herbicide on
their lawns and/or used a lawn-care company about one-third more
often than did owners of dogs without the disease. Maligant
lymphoma in dogs is very similar to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in
people. 2, 4-D also is one of the components in Agent Orange, the
defoliant used during the Vietnam War.

"We definitely want to help animals with better diagnosis and
treatment," says Richardson. "But the dream is to use animals that
may have been exposed to environmental hazards as sentinels for
how cancer develops in people."

CARBON MONOXIDE, BACKDRAFTING ISSUES ADDRESSED

There is a risk of carbon monoxide poisoning in any building with
fuel burning equipment. In some buildings this risk is essentially nil,
such as houses that use electricity for home and water heating,
clothes drying, and cooking and that do not have attached garages
where gasoline engines may be operated. In other buildings, the risk
of carbon monoxide poisoning is also very low, such as houses with
newer, high-efficiency, closed-combustion furnaces, boilers, or
water heaters. However, the overwhelming majority of houses have
boilers, fireplaces, furnaces and water heaters that use house air to
support combustion and depend upon traditional chimneys or flues to
vent combustion products to the outdoors. When combustion products
spill into the house (backdraft), the potential for carbon monoxide
poisoning is established.

Unfortunately, many conventional boilers, fireplaces, furnaces and
water heaters spill combustion products into the home. Spillage
commonly occurs during the first minute or two of ignition until the
chimney is sufficiently warm to draw combustion products to the
top. The longer the spillage occurs, the greater the risk. Complete
spillage may result from several causes: a blocked chimney, a
disconected flue, a cracked heat exchanger, or an insufficient
amount of air to support the draft up the chimney. The latter
condition occurs when the combustion appliance is located in a
space that is under negative pressure (depressurized) relative to the
outdoors. The amount of depressurization depends on the air-
tightness of the space containing the combustion appliance and the
capacity of other exhaust devices as well as duct design and leakage
in forced-air heating/cooling systems.

Fortunately, carbon monoxide is usually found in very small
concentrations in combustion gases from properly maintained
furnaces, boilers and water heaters. However, when combustion is
starved for oxygen, an atom of oxygen is stripped from carbon
dioxide (CO2, a common combustion byproduct) and carbon monoxide
(CO) is produced.

WHAT'S THE RISK OF CO POISONING?

Several hundred people die from carbon monoxide produced by
combustion appliances in the home each year. Several thousand
additional people have less dramatic symptoms of carbon monoxide
poisoning (headaches, nausea, shortness of breath) although not all
the symptoms may be attributed to carbon monoxide.

WHO SHOULD BE CONCERNED?

Any contractor, tradesperson, inspector, or sponsor who makes
modification of ventilation rates in houses should be concerned
about combustion spillage. This includes those who: install exhaust
fans and devices, modify HVAC systems, and/or modify airtightness
of buildings or install mitigation systems. Mitigation contractors
have been alerted to this concern since 1986 by the New York State
Energy Office (NYSEO) and, since 1988 by the U.S. EPA. These alerts
cited previous guidance directed to low-income weatherization
providers and other contractors by the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE). Portions of DOE's guidance reflect tests required by building codes.

WHICH TEST IS BEST?

First, any of the described tests is better than none. Second, each
test is like a tool -- one may fit a specific radon mitigator in a
situation better than another contractor in another situation. Select
the test that best fits your situation (understanding limitations),
conduct it, document and report it.

WHY NOT PROVIDE CLIENT WITH A DETECTOR?

Passive carbon monoxide detectors are available for about $3.
However, there are several concerns about such detectors: first, the
minimum sensitivity of such detectors may be above the threshold
of health effects; second, the detectors must periodically be
replaced (for example, every month); and third, the detector requires
a significant CO exposure that may not be discovered by the occupant
in time.

WHAT ABOUT HEAT-SENSITIVE DETECTORS?

These devices are probably fine as a back-up but are not a substitute
for spillage testing when working on a house. Such detectors require
the client to monitor the detector.

WHY NOT MEASURE CARBON DIOXIDE NEAR COMBUSTION APPLIANCES
TO DETECT SPILLAGE?

If you have a carbon dioxide monitor (several hundred to several
thousand dollars) or hand pump and detector tubes (several hundred
dollars), you can measure for it. For most radon mitigation, an
inexpensive smoke bottle will be adequate to test for spillage associated with
depressurization (conditions may be related to radon mitigation). Of course, a
carbon dioxide test may reflect other defects (e.g. cracked heat exchanger) not
related to radon.

WHY NOT USE A BLOWER DOOR TO CHECK SPILLAGE?

A blower door is a great diagnostic tool in the hands of a skilled
operator, especially for advanced indoor air quality work. If you use
a blower door and understand interzonal analysis, use your blower
door in your spillage checks. However, a blower door is not a
requirement for testing for backdrafting.

WHO HAS DIED FROM CO DUE TO RADON MITIGATION?

The best available evidence suggests about 10 percent of houses
with conventional combustion appliances have unacceptable spillage
due to depressurization. Most radon mitigation increases
depressurization. A brief test for spillage, requiring several minutes
by an EPA-approved conractor, is not unreasonable. No EPA-approved
contractor should reduce one environmental health risk while increasing
another.

GIVE ME A SIMPLE CHECKLIST SO I CAN GUARANTEE I'LL NEVER HAVE
A PROBLEM.

There are simple procedures and checklists to help you test for
spillage, as previously identified. However, there is not any one test
that will ensure future maintenance and use of combustion
appliances. Thus, it is unclear how a reasonable person could expect
or offer an
unconditional guarantee.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES FOR BACKDRAFTING INFORMATION

* National Fuel Gas Code, Appendix H (pages 2223.1-89), 1988,
"Recommended Procedures for Safety Inspection of an Existing
Appliance Installation." This procedure includes a combustion
appliance spillage test (at the draft hood using smoke) while
exterior windows and doors, fireplace dampers, and the door
between the combustion appliance and the remainder of the house
are closed and exhaust fans and devices are operated.

* American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
Engineers, ASHRE Standard 62-1989, Appendix B, "Positive
Combustion Air Supply." This procedure includes combustion spillage
testing involving measuring the ratio of dilution air in the stack
above the draft hood (40 percent minimum) under "closed house"
conditions and with all commonly used exhaust fans and devices
operated. This test should not be performed when the inside-outside
temperature difference is more the 30 degrees farenheit (18 degrees
celsius) or wind velocity is more than 5 mph (2.2 m/s).

* "Procedure for Determining the Safety of Residential Chimneys"
in Chimney Safety Test User's Manual (Second Edition) prepared for
the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CHMC) by Scanada -
Sheltair Consortium (January 12, 1988). This document outlines a
two-step procedure: the first step involves a simple paper
excercise; and, if necessary, a more rigorous "worst case
simulation" test using pressure measurement in spaces containing
combustion devices as well as spillage tests.

* "Worst Case Draft Test"  required by the Minnesota Department of
Jobs and Training, St. Paul, MN., for all weatherization contractors
using state administered federal funds. This procedure outlines a
simple pressure measurement in flues under "closed house"
conditions and with all commonly used exhaust fans and devices
operating.

* "Retrofit Ventilation System Guide," 1991 (November), Energy
Conservatory, Minneapolis, MN., for blower door operators. This
procedure outlines an indoor air quality strategy involving
combustion spillage tests using simple equipment and procedures.
Radon mitigation contractors may wish to check with local HVAC
inspectors, HVAC contractors, or low-income weatherization
providers about these or similar procedures. Each procedure has
advantages and disadvantages that should be considered.

FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS HALT BOGUS AIR FILTER CLAIMS

"Phototron" indoor greenhouse claimed to remove everything,
including radon and pet odors.

Phototron indoor greenhouse isn't all it's cracked up to be. At least,
that's the opinion of investigators at the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), who charge that San Diego-based Pyraponic Industries II, Inc.
and it's owner, Jeffery Julian DeMarco, made false and
unsubstantiated claims that their "Phototron" indoor air cleaner
would remove all indoor air contaminants.

According to the FTC, Pyraponic ran advertisements in a variety of
national magazines claiming it's "Phototron natural home air
purifier" would remove "radon, formaldehyde, pet odors, kitchen and
bathroom smells, cigarette smoke" and, at the same time,
"replentish oxygen 33 times, along with the fresh scent of the
plants of your choice." Furthermore, the ads claimed a Phototron
could eliminate all pollutants in a 1,000 square foot area.

FTC staffers agreed to a consent decree to settle the charges with
Pryaponic, which prohibits the firm from representing in the future
that its products remove all indoor air contaminants.

The decree also requires the company's future ads be based on
"competent and reliable scientific evidence supporting its claims
that Phototron is a viable substitute, or is superior to, any other air
cleaning products, or is effective within a specific size area."

A January 1992 General Accounting Office report makes it clear
misrepresentation and public manipulation in the air and water
filtration and treatment industries is occuring. The report warns
consumers that disjointed regulation of these emerging industries
has left the door open for unscrupulous businesspersons.

Policing air and water cleaning systems is something the FTC does
under its "Green Claims" category. FTC staffers say complaints that
focus on a company's attempt to take advantage of public concern
about the environment are becoming more common.  Several claims
have been made to date by the FTC against water and air purification
companies.

Editor's Note: Consent agreements (decrees) are for
settlement purposes only and are not an admission of
participation in an unlawful act. Consent orders carry the force of
law, once finalized by the agency, with respect to future
actions. Violations can result in fines as high as $10,000.

RADON HAS ITS DAY IN MARYLAND COURT

In the Spring 1992 issue of RND, we reported the story of a
Baltimore, Maryland tenant who broke her lease after discovering
her rental home had an indoor radon level of 9 pCi/l.

The renter, Nina Bingham, moved out of the home immediately after
discovering the elevated radon level and was sued by the owner of
the rental unit for past rent, damages and legal fees.

Unfortunately for Bingham, her lease agreement did not include a
provision (relating to radon or other indoor air pollutants) for
breaking the lease, the judge reluctantly sided with the property
owner, ruling that Bingham did not follow proper protocol for
breaking a lease in the State of Maryland.

Cindy Scott Hibert, a producer at WMAR TV Channel 2 in Baltimore,
the station which originally reported on the  story, told RND "the
problem with Nina was that she didn't follow the proper steps. If she
just would have followed our county statutes -- which require
proper return of keys, notification, and  the establishment of an
escrow account for rent payments -- the judge would have ruled in
her favor."

Hilbert, a licensed attorney, says  the most  interesting twist to
this emotional story is that the realtor who arranged the lease
produced a document releasing Bingham from it.

"Unfortunately, Nina didn't want to sign it," Hilbert says. "She
should have."

Hilbert says although the judge determined an elevated radon level
does pose a health risk to Bingham and her children, he had no legal
grounds to support his personal feeling that Bingham had done the
right thing.

"I'm just praying that a tenant (with an elevated radon level in a
leased property) will come forward and follow the law as it regards
breaking leases.

"Breaking a lease for reasons of elevated radon is possible (in
Maryland, or elsewhere) if it is done so by the books," Hilbert says.

"I can't wait," she added. "Then we'll really see some changes."

Editor's Note: Our original story was based, in part, on an article
reported in the Midwest AARST Radon Reporter. The  article reported
Bingham had won the case, which she did, until a motion by the
plaintiff's attorney forced the judge to rule against Bingham for
improperly breaking her lease.

CERCLA: EPA ISSUES RULE ON LENDER LIABILITY

The U.S. EPA's long-awaited rule on lender liability was published in
the Federal Register, April 29, 1992 (57 Fed Reg 18344). The rule
provides protections to lenders from  contamination they are
innocent of causing.

The rule was issued to clarify statutory phrases in the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Liability and Compensation
Act (CERCLA), pertaining to property ownership and liability for
pollution cleanup.

The "security interest exemption," as defined by EPA, specifies the
range of activities which may be conducted by an entity/person who
maintains  "indicia" ownership of a facility for security interests -
- without such activities being deemed "participation" in managing
the secured  property.

The resulting EPA final rule adopts a new test for "participation." In
brief, a lender participates in property management only if the
lender either exercises decision-making control over environmental
compliance issues on the property, or, where the actions of the
lender create or assume responsibility for the day-to-day operations
of the property. The agency also determined that a government
lender, receiver or conservator  which involuntarily aquires a
contaminated property is entitled to "innocent landowner" third-
party defense provided under CERCLA Section 101 (35)(a)(ii) and
(107)(B)(3).

According to environmental attorneys interviewed by RND, a
government entity, not-for-profit organization or university, for
example, which acquired a property as a gift, would qualify for the
innocent landowner defense. Under CERCLA there are three defenses
under which a property holder may be absolved of liability. If the
pollution was caused by 1) an act of a third-party with whom the
property holder has no contractual relationship; 2) an act of God; or
3) an act of War.

Although radon gas is listed  in the Hazardous Waste Regulations (40
CFR 302.4)(Appendix B), environmental attorneys say they aren't
clear whether or not radon is actually a CERCLA issue.
"Theoretically," one attorney  says,"itTs a CERCLA issue. But, a
lender making a residential loan probably wouldn't be concerned
about radon.

Nevertheless, lenders should be concerned about radon. They'll want
to do their environmental due dilligence upfront, whether they are
required to do so by law or not."

Editor's Note: EPA has classified radon as a "Class A" carcinogen.

HOME BUYER'S AND SELLER'S GUIDE TO RADON: REVIEW

Draft copy yields variety of responses; comments shed light on
concerns.

There has been much speculation as to what the soon-to-be-released
EPA "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon" will advise. The
purpose of the guide, according to EPA, is to help both home buyer's
and seller's become informed about radon and its dangers, learn how
to test a home and, should it be necessary, determine the best way
to remediate.

A draft copy of the "Real Estate Guide" (October 1991) along with
interviews with EPA officials reveals some of the agency's possible
recommendations for radon testing during a real property transfer.
EPA advises buyers of homes that have already been tested for radon
to "select your own professional radon contractor." In addition, the
agency instructs buyers to find out: 1) The results of the previous
test, 2) Who conducted it, and, 3) Where in the house the test was
performed.

Buyers of homes that have not previously been tested for radon are
advised to: 1) Make sure a radon test is done as soon as possible, 2)
"Work with the seller to arrange testing," 3) Make sure the test is
conducted on the lowest level in which the buyer intends to use.
In addition, the draft includes sections on test results and what they
mean, radon in water, remediation, selecting a mitigator, EPA's RMP
program, radon myths and a copy of the risk chart from the"Citizen's
Guide".

INDUSTRY COMMENTS

As usual, many radon industry members submitted comments to EPA
expressing their concerns about the contents of the draft "Real
Estate Guide". Many of these concerns were expressed in the review
comments submitted by the radon industry via the American
Association of Radon Scientists and Technologists (AARST). Some of
these concerns are detailed in the following

AARST COMMENTS.

AARST recommends that EPA change the words "lowest living area"
to "lowest liveable area" before finalizing the document. AARST
reviewers say the "lowest living area" instruction (contained in the
draft) does not provide enough direction for the buyer of a real
property, which may result in a "grey area" in need of
interpretation. In many cases, AARST reviewers say, a buyer of a
home relies on a real estate agent to interpret these unclear issues.

Real estate agents, the reviewers say, have a vested interest in
making certain that radon results are low and that his/her
interpretation of what constitutes the "lowest living area" may not
be in the best interest of the buyer.

Instead of following EPA's lead, AARST reviewers offer several
"good" reasons for continuing the "lowest liveable area" approach.
The basement, according to one EPA  contractor, can be easily and
consistently maintained under closed house conditions. This
measurement location gives the most consistent readings in both
summer and winter. Confirmation of results, he says, is more
consistent, thus avoiding the confusion of the larger measurement
variations found during first floor testing.

As an interesting twist, results of an informal survey of AARST
members also was provided to EPA. The survey found that most radon
industry leaders believe the "lowest liveable area" of a home should
be tested at a minimum. A majority of those surveyed said they
believe that both the "lowest liveable area" and "lowest living
area" should be tested simultaneously.

Sixty-seven percent of those polled said they support a single
measurement period with duplicate measurements versus 36 percent
who said they would support a recommended follow-up test.

According to EPA's Rita Hoyt, the draft guide currently is undergoing
an internal review. The agency hopes to release the final version of
the "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon" this fall.

DRAFT EPA RADON TESTING PROTOCOLS

The following is taken from a draft version of EPA's "Buyer's and
Seller's Guide to Radon." These are NOT the finalized radon testing
protocols for real estate transactions. Draft documents are
presented here for your review. Please be sure to check with the EPA
before making decisions based on information contained in any
government document draft. EPA says it expects to release the final
document later this fall.

TESTING PROTOCOL ONE

Protocol 1(a). Take a short-term test.
Protocol 1(b). If your results are 4 pCi/l or higher, take a follow-up
short-term test to be sure.

MITIGATION OPTIONS

Under protocol 1 (a) or (b): Fix the home if the average of the first
and second tests is 4 pCi/l or more.

TESTING PROTOCOL TWO

Protocol 2. Take two short-term tests at the same time.

MITIGATION OPTIONS

Under protocol 2: Fix the home if the average of the two tests is 4
pCi/l or more.

TESTING PROTOCOL THREE

Protocol 3. Test the home with a continuous monitor for at least 48
hours -- preferably longer.

MITIGATION OPTIONS

Under protocol 3: Fix the home if the average radon level is 4 pCi/l
or more.

RADON TEST DEVICE PLACEMENT

According to a recent EPA draft, the testing device(s) should be
placed in the lowest level of the home suitable for occupancy. For
example, the basement, if it is used frequently. If you are the seller,
and currently not using the basement, you may still want to test the
basement if it could be used by a buyer without renovations. The test
should be conducted in a room used regularly (like a living room, play
room, den or bedroom, but not a kitchen or bath).

In selecting a testing option, you may want to consider factors such
as cost, accuracy, availability of tamper-resistant features, and
how soon you can get test results. Your State Radon Office can help
you decide which option is best for you.

EPA "GEOLOGICAL PROBABILITY OF ELEVATED INDOOR RADON" MAP
DISTRIBUTED, CRITICIZED

Attendees of the National Association of Counties annual meeting in
Minneapolis, Minnesota this past July, received  draft copies of the
U.S. EPA's "Geological Probability of Elevated Indoor Radon" map.

The map is designed to reflect NURE data, as well as radon testing
data from both EPA and U.S. Geologic Surveys.

The map, still in draft form, is a political football, some government
insiders say, because it is highly generalized and fails to provide
enough specific data.

Several state radon program directors say they agree. "The
usefulness of the map (to the public), is not very great," says one
program director whose opinion seems to be shared by several
others interviewed by RND. Program directors who have seen the
draft, say the map is better than nothing, but needs some improvement before
being released to the public.

Local and state government representatives say they have made
their concerns about the map known to EPA, but says one, "we're not
sure they'll do anything to address our concerns."

Mike Hanson of the Ohio Geologic Survey says the map leaves
something to be desired. For instance, Hanson says, in some areas,
where we know 60 percent of the homes are likely to have elevated
radon levels of 4-20 pCi/l, the map says otherwise.

Another problem is that the map is based on "lowest liveable space"
readings. States are concerned their test databases would become
obsolete because of new protocols in the Citizen's Guide.

RADON LEGISLATION AND RELOCATION PROPERTY TRANSFERS

National, state and local radon legislation reviewed

As the downturn in the U.S. economy continues, every corporate
department is under pressure to reduce costs and relocation is no
exception. Some companies are reducing relocation costs by
transferring fewer employees and all are carefully scrutinizing
their relocation policy for cost-cutting opportunities. In the past
several months, I have been asked whether there have been any
recent events that would justify saving money by eliminating radon
tests. The answer to the question is an uncategorical "no." In fact,
there has been a spate of recent state and federal legislation
designed to encourage radon testing and awareness.

STATE LEGISLATION

The following is a list of radon legislation compiled by the
Conference of Radiation Control, an association of state and local
radiation control programmers showing both proposed and enacted
legislation in the 18 states in which the issue has come before the
legislature (as of February 1992).

California -- AB765, Chapter 1.5. Establishes requirements for the
certification of radon measurement laboratories, radon testing and
consulting specialists, and radon mitigation contractors.

Connecticut -- Sec. 19a-14b, General Statutes. Requires any
company that performs testing or mitigation to be certified by the
state, and mandates publication of a list of these companies.
S.234. Addresses radon hazards in schools.

District of Columbia -- Proposed "Indoor Safe Air Act." Would
establish procedures for testing and abatement of radon gas and
radon progeny in District of Columbia buildings.

Illinois -- HB1611, The Radon Testing Act.
Authorizes the Department of Environment to establish a
registration program for individuals and companies that test for
radon.

HB 2709, The Radon Mitigation Act. This is basically an omnibus act,
authorizing the Department of Environment to conduct a wide range
of activities including surveys, public education programs, and other
radon-related activities.

Indiana -- IC 13-1-14. Authorizes rules to establish and operate
programs for the certification of individuals engaged in testing for
radon gas in buildings and in soil, and the abatement of radon gas in
buildings.

Iowa -- Chapter 136B of the Iowa Code. Mandates that persons who
do testing and mitigation be certified by the state. Establishes
requirements for reporting test results on non-public buildings, and
outlines department spot-check validity measurements and
reporting procedures.

Kansas -- Proposed HB 2408. Would require state certification of
persons providing devices or services related to radon testing and
mitigation.

Maine -- Chapter 165 Revised Statutes Annotated, Title 22, sec. 771
et seq. Establishes a program to register firms and individuals
involved with radon testing, consulting, or other remedial services
to ensure accurate radon testing, to encourage safe and effective
mitigation of dangerous radon levels, and to protect property
owners from unqualified or unscrupulous vendors.

Massachusetts -- Proposed HB 548. Would establish requirements
for persons testing and mitigating radon. Would require that a
radon test be done by the seller of any residential dwelling and
would require pertinent information about the test be made
available to a prospective buyer.

Proposed HB 2099. Would require any peron who tests for and
mitigates radon to be certified by the state and to file timely
reports.

Proposed HB 3160. Would provide a tax credit for testing and
abatement of radon gas.

New Hampshire -- RSA 125:9. States that the director of the
Division of Public Health Services shall conduct inspections of all
buildings and dwellings, upon request, for the presence of radon or
other health hazards present in indoor air. Provides education,
technical consultation, and recommendations for abatement of such
health hazards in conjunction with the University of New Hampsire
cooperative extension service.

RSA 477:4a. States that, prior to the execution of any contract for
the purchase and sale of any interest in real propoerty that includes
a building, the seller or the seller's agent shall provide notice to the
buyer that radon may be found in some areas of New Hampshire.

New Jersey -- PL 1985, Chapter 408. Establishes a state radon
program.

Building Code Council.

Wisconsin -- Act 399. Authorizes the development and
dissemination of radon information, and the coordination of a
program to measure radon gas, perform home surveys, develop
training materials, and conduct training classes.

Most of the aforementioned legislation concerns certification or
licensing of companies engaged in testing for, or mitigation of,
radon. It is likely that the majority of states will have this type of
legislation in place within the next few years. Licensing and
registration of testers and mitigators is a positive change for
relocation because it upgrades the overall quality of testers and
remediators and identifies a pool of qualified companies available to
the relocation administrator.

It is more difficult to predict whether more states will enact
mandatory testing and/or disclosure statutes. However, given the
increasingly broad court interpretations of the duty to disclose, the
National Association of Realtors' recommendation that its state
members propose and lobby for state disclosure laws, and current
federal legislation (discussed below), it is likely that a substantial
number of states will enact radon testing and disclosure legislation
in the coming years.

The significance of state laws to the relocation administrator is
that such legislation may conflict with a company's relocation
policies in some way. In all cases to date, state requirements with
respect to testing and disclosure are minimum standards, and there
is nothing wrong in exceeding them. For example, a company may
decide to require mitigation as well as disclosure of test results.
However, varying state laws necessitate that a company's radon
policy also vary according to the state from which the employee is
transferred.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION

For the past several years, I have been reporting on bills
introduced before the U.S. House and Senate on the subject of radon.
Few have been voted on. On March 10 of this year, the Senate passed
S. 792, a reauthorization of the Indoor Radon Abatement Act of
1988, known as the Indoor Radon Abatement Reauthorization Act of
1991. This very comprehensive bill is likely to be modified in
conference, should the House pass its radon bill, H.R. 3258, the
"Radon Awareness and Disclosure Act." The House bill has not come
up for a vote as of the date this article was written, but is expected
to pass if the House is able to vote on it in this an election year.

Among the provision of S. 792 of interest to relocation:

1) Federally mandates the EPA's development of a "Home Buyer's and
Seller's Guide to Radon," a document specifically aimed at the real
estate process. As with the "Citizen's Guide to Radon," E-R-C and
other organizations have been working with and advising EPA on the
content of this document for more than a year. The current draft
presently is undergoing review by the administrator of EPA. (Editor's
Note: EPA staffers say the document should be released sometime
this fall.)

2) The "CitizenTs Guide to Radon" is described in the legislation.
This guide already has been completed.

3) The bill requires that "every original mortgage institution"
provide the "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon" to each
person "from whom it receives or for whom it prepares a written
application for an applicable mortgage loan." In addition, it bars
federally chartered secondary mortgage institutions from
purchasing any loans in which this requirement has not been met.
The application for a mortgage usually is made after the contract of
sale is signed by the buyer. In order to reduce pressure to amend
contracts based on the warnings in this brochure, it is likely that
real estate agents will begin making the booklets available at or
before the signing of the contracts, should this part of the bill be
adopted into law.

4) The bill also provides for federal radon disclosure. Any
residential dwelling or multi-unit structure owned by the federal
government or any government corporation located in a high priority
radon area (as defined below) will have to be tested prior to the
contract of sale, and the results of that test disclosed to the
potential buyer.

5) The bill requires EPA to come up with a list of high priority radon
areas, based on indoor radon test results and geology. The country
would be divided into three such zones, each ranking the likelihood
of finding indoor radon. However, EPA will not change its
recommendation that all homes, regardless of their location, be
tested. See Radon Map page 11.

6) EPA, in conjunction with other agencies, will be required to
devise model construction standards for radon resistant housing. All
federally assisted housing, and federal office and other structures
are to be built using this technology in high priority radon areas.

The remainder of the bill contains outreach, research, and disclosure
provisions, all of which are designed to increase radon awareness
among the general public and encourage testing and disclosure.

EPA ACTIVITIES

Regardless of whether any federal legislation is passed this year,
EPA will continue to carry out its mandate under the 1988 Act to
provide information to the public on the dangers of indoor radon
pollution and its elimination. EPA's Radon Division currently has a
number of projects underway. The ones most directly affecting
relocation are the publication of the previously mentioned "Citizen's
Guide to Radon" and the "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon."

In addition, it has begun programs to provide information and grants
to state radiation control departments, to perform research on radon
testing and mitigation, to perform research and devise recommended
model building codes for radon-resistant construction, to administer
the Radon Contractor Proficiency (RCP) program, and to devise and
implement public information campaigns aimed at persuading the
public to test for and mitigate indoor radon. EPA already has
produced the first draft of a national radon potential map that
divides the U.S. into three radon zones, similar to the requirements
of S. 792.

Acting on the advice of E-R-C and other real estate groups, EPA has
committed to producing the "Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to
Radon" as a supplement to the "CitizenTs Guide," aimed strictly at
the real estate transaction. Besides being a more concise document
than the "Citizen's Guide," the "Real Estate Guide" will recommend
short-term testing protocol that is not as time consuming and,
hopefully, not as expensive as the two-test recommendation in the
"Citizen's Guide."

After months of consulting with outside groups and scientists, EPA
narrowed the possible testing methodologies to eight, and asked for
an opinion from its Science Advisory Board as to the efficacy of
each. Although the board has yet to return its recommendations, it
appears likely that the "Real Estate Guide" will recommend either
one short-term test in the lowest liveable area of the house, or two
short-term simultaneous tests in the lowest living area.

WHAT THIS MEANS TO RELOCATION

The relocation industry took an early, pro-active stance concerning
indoor radon. Because of the policies that were enacted years ago, it
has been argued that a potential spate of claims and lawsuits has
been avoided.

When EPA began to reconsider its recommended testing procedures,
the scope of the testing and remediation required to limit liability
became unclear. When released in the "Citizen's Guide" and the "Real
Estate Guide", these recommendations essentially will form the
minimum standard for any relocation policy.

Absent any federal or state law to the contrary, relocation
administrators will be free to reevaluate their radon policies,
bringing them into compliance with the recommendations of EPA
publications, making judgements about, for example, whether it is
necessary, from a liability point of view, to remediate homes with
levels moderately above 4 pCi/l, or whether simple disclosure will
adequately protect against liability.

All of these decisions will be made in an environment in which, if
EPA is sucessful, all home buyers will be better informed about
indoor radon potentials.

HR 3258 REVIEWERS MAKE COMMENTS, SHARE CONCERNS

As radon-related bills develop and mature on Capitol Hill, both
private and public sector lobbyists spend considerable effort
organizing letter writing campaigns, telephone trees and
encouraging industry members to make known their concerns. During
the formulation and development of House Bill 3258, and its
companion, Senate Bill 792, the radon industry showed it is no
exception to the rule.

On March 10 of this year, the Senate passed S. 792, a reauthorization
of the Indoor Radon Abatement Act of 1988, known as the Indoor
Radon Abatement Reauthorization Act of 1991. This very
comprehensive bill is likely to be modified in conference, should the
House pass its radon bill, H.R. 3258, the "Radon Awareness and
Disclosure Act."

The comment period for H.R. 3258 drew a variety of responses,
including comments providing insight into organizations and their
concern for the radon issue. Of particular interest to our readers are
comments submitted by Richard Martin (AARST), Dr. Jill Lipoti (New
Jersey, Department of Environmental Protection), Bob Chase
(National Education Association and the National Parents and
Teachers Association), and representatives for the National
Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and the Consumer Association
of America.

NAHB

NAHB comments indicate the organization supports "prescriptive
construction techniques only in areas where radon is a problem."
NAHB says its members might need an "incentive" to cooperate
volunarily, such as a limitation on liability for builders who build to
EPA construction standards or state equivalents.

As has been the case in the past, NAHB says it "does not believe
tying radon testing to the home sales transaction is the answer."
The primary objection, short-term test reliance. As a justification
for their objection to testing new homes as a condition of sale,
NAHB says its members believe testing should only be done while the
homeowner is actually living in the home. In addition, they say, "new
homes take up to a year to settle" so testing a brand new house that
has not fully settled "is likely" to produce a false reading.

The association says its members already are complaining that
banks are refusing to make loans for homes where testing is
required as a condition of sale -- "out of fear for future legal
liability."

CONSUMER FEDERATION

The Consumer Federation for America, in conjunction with the
American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, the
American Public Health Association and the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, made their feelings about H.R. 3258 known to
legislators as well.

Representatives from these organizations say they believe the
public can no longer rely on realtors, builders, salespersons or the
radon industry to inform them about radon. The reason: ignorance.
These organizations say they believe the American public is in need
of an education when it comes to radon, especially if they are to
make decisions about testing and mitigation voluntarily.

According to a national survey conducted by the Federation, few
Americans are prepared to make such decisions by themselves. When
survey respondants were asked "Why is radon a problem?", 17
percent replied because it can cause high blood pressure, 15 percent
believed the gas caused unpleasant odors, and an additional six
percent said they believed it discolored walls and furniture.

As far as testing is concerned, nearly half of all respondants knew
next to nothing about radon testing.

According to the Federation survey, 45 percent of Americans
surveyed answered the question "How do you detect radon?"
incorrectly. Twenty-two percent of the respondants said radon could
be detected by smell, 12 percent by stains on walls and 11 percent
by using a Geiger counter.

The Federation says its supports H.R. 3258 because "it addresses
two fundamental issues for consumers: saving lives and protecting
consumers in radon-related transactions. Protection? From what?
According to the Federation, consumers need protections from
potentially unscrupulous radon contractors and test device
manufacturers who fail to participate and pass proficiency exams.
Civil penalties should be put in place, the Federation says, "to act as
a deterrent."

PARENTS AND TEACHERS

The NEA and PTA, both organizations specifically concerned about
radon in schools, say a two-tiered approach is needed to address the
issue in America's schools. First, they say, schools in high radon
priority areas should be tested as soon as possible. Schools not
located in high radon priority areas should be allowed four years
from the date of enactment to test.

In determining compliance, NEA says it believes the legislation
should specify waivers to school districts which have already tested
and/or mitigated -- providing all EPA protocol, including parent and
teacher notification of testing and mitigation results, were
followed.

NEA also says it supports an "ongoing annual notification rule"
requiring schools to keep parents notified of the mitigation process
progress until completed.

NEW JERSEY DEP

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection says it
supports the continuation of grant assistance to state programs
found in H.R. 3258, however, the agency says, "more" state
assistance is needed. The agency says it believes the feds must kick
in additional support, including 75 percent program costs, in order
for most states to continue existing and planned radon programs.

They cite a recent Conference of Radiation Control Program
Directors survey which indicates state radon programs are in danger
of being cut back. The survey found that if State Indoor Radon Grants
are not extended beyond fiscal year 1991, 84 percent of the
responding state radon program leaders said they "would be forced
to reduce their radon program, drastically."

Thirty-four percent said they would eliminate staff, while six
percent would have to abandon their programs entirely.

NJDEP, no doubt echoing the opinions of other states with existing
radon programs and legislation, suggests exempting persons
participating in state programs from mandatory participation in a
federal program, in order to "avoid placing undue burden on regulated
individuals in states which already have a state certification
program, the requirements of which, in most cases, far exceed those
listed in H.R. 3258."

AARST

Representing the radon industry, Rich Martin, president of DMA-
RADTECH, said H.R. 3258 would help reduce cancer risk by
providing increased industry professionalism by mandating
participation in testing and mitigation programs. Mandatory
participation in RMP/RCP programs, the association says, will help
"elevate the quality" of radon related services to a minimum
competence level acceptable to a federal agency.

Not unlike the Consumer Federation, AARST also supports the civil
penalties contained in the bill.  those contractors who choose not to
follow the laws regarding certification and participation.

The radon industry association says if H.R. 3258 is enacted it will
help reduce cancers risk by: 1) providing financial assistance to
schools which need to test and/or mitigate but cannot afford to do
so, 2) requiring schools that test or mitigate to utilize approved
firms or individuals who have satisfactorily passed certification
programs, and, 3) forming a Presidential Commission on Radon
Awareness designed to assure radon public outreach programs reach
their specific goals.

EPA RADON PROGRAM REVIEW: GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE SECTOR
RESPONSES ARE VARIED

Last fall, radon industry professionals participated in an intra-
agency review of EPA's Radon Program. Comprised of members of
government and the private sector, the agency's Radon Program
Review Panel was charged with assessing the program's past
efforts, current progress and future direction. Their efforts
produced a draft report, sent to reviewers earlier this year, which
assessed the costs and effectiveness of a range of radon control
strategies and contained the Panel's findings and recommendations
for improving the radon program.

EPA REVIEWERS

EPA says it is looking for "opportunities for pursuing new
directions" in an effort to increase radon reduction in the U.S. The
agency says the review was conducted with three objectives in
mind:

1) to examine the appropriateness of program goals and EPA's
progress in achieving them;

2) to evaluate the effectiveness of the current approach; and

3) to identify alternative approaches and determine what they might
enable EPA to accomplish.

EPA representatives on the panel included senior managers who were
responsible for recommending actions which would improve the
radon program and determine the appropriate role government should
play in reducing public risk. Four major recommendations were
issued.

1) EPA should focus on the greatest risks first. In the near-term,
EPA should target its efforts and resources on high radon potenital
areas and smoking-related risk. EPA survey data indicate about half
of the homes over the action level are located in areas comprising
(as a group) about one-fifth of the country. This same area is
estimated to contain a significant portion of the lives projected to
be saved if all U.S. homes above the current 4 pCi/l action level were
tested and mitigated. Current epidemiological data indicate both
smokers and former smokers face over 90 percent of radon risk.
While EPA should not abandon its efforts in other areas, these
factors must shape EPA's policy.

2) EPA should work now to support the long-term strategies of
promoting radon-resistant new construction and testing and
mitigation in connection with real estate transfers. Beginning in
targeted areas, EPA should encourage and support pilot projects at
the State and local level and explore new approaches to implement
these strategies. EPA experience to date indicate the vast majority
of radon risk reduction occurs in the context of real estate
transactions and adoption of new construction standards has the
potential for very cost-effective risk reduction -- in some cases
saving both lives and dollars. While the risk reductions offered by
these strategies are modest at first, over the long-term, they offer
the possibility of very large risk reductions. Only through these
strategies can EPA aspire to its ultimate statutory goal of
approaching ambient levels in all U.S. homes.

3) A new strategy for public information. As a health risk controlled
primarily by individual citizens, EPA has properly set for itself a
central and independent goal of informing the public about radon
risk. The public's generally weak response suggests EPA must move
beyond a program of nationwide public information efforts such as
the "Citizen's Guide" and the Advertising Council's public service
announcement campaign. In the short-term, EPA's public information
efforts should focus on high radon potential areas and populations. In
the long-term, efforts should be directed toward construction of
radon-resistant new homes and testing and mitigation of existing
homes when they are sold.

4) EPA should develop a coordinated research plan. EPA has
successfully supported a wide range of radon testing, mitigation,
and characterization research. With basic technologies established,
EPA must develop a long-term plan to prioritize and coordinate
potential future research in areas such as health effects,
measurement, mitigation technology, geographic targeting, and risk
communication approaches.

THE PRIVATE SECTOR

Private sector reviewers developed recommendations addressing
several dozen issues which affect the radon industry. Of
significance are three of the panel's findings relating to radon and
public information, resistant building techniques and radon testing
at point of sale.

1) Reducing Risk by Radon Resistant Construction. The panel
determined "if all new homes built in designated areas" were built
with radon-resistant features, an estimated 30-50 lung cancers
deaths would be averted each year. The panel noted the rate of lives
saved would increase each year.

"Radon resistant new homes," the panel says, "are also specially
sealed and weatherized, which, in addition to retarding radon entry,
can make the home substantially more energy efficient. This
increaseed efficiency is estimated to yield a substantial energy
credit."

2) Reducing radon risk at real estate transactions. Because most
radon testing and mitigation currently occurs during real estate
transactions, the panel says "testing and mitigation of all homes
sold would yield steadily increasing risk reduction each year."

According to the panel, nationwide testing and mitigation of all
home sold (when necessary) would avert an estimated 110 lung
cancer deaths at a cost of $700,000 per life saved. The panel noted
requiring distribution of radon information when homes are
purchased with federal-guaranteed mortgages would offer only
moderate risk reduction -- averting an estimated 10-15 lung cancer
deaths each year.

Editor's Note: It would take approximately 10 years of information
distribution in federal-related mortgages to produce lung cancer
death reductions equal to or greater than one year of requiring radon
testing and mitigation during all real property transfers.

3) Public Information. The reviewers determined that state and local
public information and incentive programs have yielded "limited
responses." EPA's experience to date suggests, the panel says,
"public information alone is not enough to contribute significantly
to future risk reduction."

Public information may make its most significant risk reduction
contribution by providing support for long-term institutional
changes encouraging both actions to reduce radon risk when homes
are sold and the adoption of radon resistant new construction codes.

Other key issues examined by the panel include:

What role should government play in dealing with radon in homes?

The panel says it believes government bears a special responsibility
to inform the public about radon. Success in fulfilling this role
should be measured by the quality of information provided and the
extent of improvement in public understanding -- not necesarily the
amount of testing and mitigation it triggers.

When public protection cannot be achieved with stronger action,
government should move beyond providing information. The panel
determined government's role should be shaped by level of risk. And,
it's role in informing the public should be stronger in areas with
higher levels of risk. Both federal and state, as well as local
governments, health and consumer organizations, should play a
critical role.

What should be the ultimate goals of the radon program?

The reviewers make five suggestions, first of which is radon
reduction. Informing the public and building a private sector radon
testing and mitigation industry also is critical, the panel says.
Moving beyond solely providing information to achieve reduction is
next on the list with recommendations to establish "separate but
complementary" short- and long-term goals by which to judge
success. Improving and maintaining credibility, ranked fourth and
fifth.

To what extent should special efforts be made to reach smokers and
former smokers?

Because of substantial risk differentials between smokers, former
smokers and non-smokers, EPA should make a strong effort to target
smokers and former smokers.

The panel recommends EPA urge organizations and agencies
providing anti-smoking programs to warn smokers radon is a serious
hazard to their health  even if they stop. Exploring specific ways to
target current and former smokers is a must, they say.

How can EPA most effectively increase testing and mitigation at the
time of real estate transfers?

Voluntary testing in connection with real estate transactions is
currently too infrequent to result in significant risk reductions, the
panel says. Such voluntary testing will not increase significantly
until action is taken to remove or reduce some of the obstacles (e.g.
workable testing protocols.

The panel also says the agency should seriously examine radon
escrow accounts and dissemination of radon information at the time
of a real estate property transfer.

Is there a need for additional radon-related research?

EPA's radon-related research efforts have been successful, the panel
says, however, they are in need of greater coordination. EPA needs a
comprehensive, prioritized and coordinated plan to guide its future
research activities. Further research topics include health effects
and risk to smokers, former smokers and never smokers,
measurement device accuracy, correlations between short- and
long-term measurements, new testing devices, tamper resistant
measurement techniques, ambient radon levels in high radon
potential areas, mitigation technology, geographic targeting
research and risk communication.

Editor's Note: It will interesting to see how these recommendations
affect future EPA activities.

THE CHANGING FACE OF RISK ASSESMENT

As a young industry with many critics, professional risk
assessors say they are re-examining the way in which they
determine environmental risks. The industry is searching for the
best methods of determining risk by making swift strides away from
defining risk by "maximum worst case exposure" standards and
moving toward a "reasonable maximum exposure" unit of measure.

According to industry news articles, changing the way assessors
measure risk will make a big difference in how a site is evaluated
and treated. Risk assessors say they are ready to move toward
evaluating environmental hazards by using the "weight of evidence"
approach, which if adopted by the industry, would put radon higher
up on the EPA priority list.

Under the "weight of evidence approach," assessors would compile
all relevant data, including animal and human toxicology studies,
extrapolated estimates of risk and all additional information
available on a potential hazard, to help make a determination of risk.
Estimates of risk would then be made by examining all data
available and formulating a "reasonable maximum exposure."

The risk assessment industry is not alone in seeking change. Two
Nuclear Regulatory Committees are examining risk assessment
methods; the interagency Federa; Coordinating Council on Science,
Engineering and Technology is attempting to standardize the U.S.
government's health and environmental risk assessment methods.

Vice President Danforth Quayle's Council on Competitiveness is
evaluating biotechnology risk assessment policy. The U.S. Congress
and the White House have agreed to set up the Risk Assessment and
Management Commission. And, EPA Chief William Reilly is
prioritizing environmental hazards so EPA can perform bureaucratic
triage.

Should the EPA and risk assessors adopt the "weight of evidence"
approach, and bureuacrats begin funding environmental cleanup
program based on risk to the public, funding for the radon issue
should get a significant boost.

READER'S VIEWS

Dear Editor:

I would appreciate it very much if you would publish this letter. The
so-called "radon experts" in the Ohio Department of Health have
argued with me that radon companies that utilize continuous
monitors are not primarly laboratories and for that reason their
handlers need not be licensed as primary labs, nor need they pay the
$600 license fee required by the state.

As a result of their false interpretation of our State law
(3701-69-08), there are testers using continuous monitors who have
not paid their State registration fee and are not licensed to operate
primary laboratories according to EPA definitions.

A continuous monitor has been defined by EPA as a primary lab. It is
not fair to those of us who have paid their laboratory license fees to
allow these people to compete with us in the radon testing market
without having paid the $600 license fee. Some of these people are
in further violation of the law since they are not maintaining their
current listing in the EPA RMP Round. This fact again gives these
people a further advantage to offer cheaper radon testing services.

I had to fly to Las Vegas to the EPA Radon facility on order to
maintain my current listing for continuous monitors. Flight, hotel,
cab fare, etc., cost me $650, which I now have to pass on to the
consumer.

Therefore, I am asking that the DOH immediately enforce the law by
ordering non-licensed and non-EPA listed primary labs to cease
radon testing using continuous monitors.

The success of the newly-enacted State Radon Licensure Program
depends on its fair and equitable enforcement for all.

Editor's note: We contacted the Ohio radon program and were told
that the state "as of now" does not require continuous monitor
operators to meet the requirements of a primary radon laboratory.
State officials told RND that continuous monitors are considered "a
tool" and for that reason operators of those devices need not meet
primary lab requirements.

We also contacted EPA and they seem to be in agreement with Mr.
Dollwet, although at presstime, we were unable to get through to
those "in the know" at the agency. We will follow-up on this issue
and report our findings in a future issue.

Mr. Dollwet, meanwhile, has found his own solution. He says, if the
State of Ohio won't make the situation right he will refuse to pay
future State licensing fees.

Dear Editor:

I just received the enclosed bulletin from Mr. Cris Collie of the
Employee Relocation Council. (The bulletin alerts those concerned
with real estate property transfers that H.R. 11, a House bill
containing a proposal to place a cap of $5,000 on allowable moving
expense deductions, needs an immediate response from radon
industry members.)

With the consumer deficient awareness of the radon hazard and the
apathetic attitude of many in the federal and state governments,
radon testing where it is not mandatory will be an expense that will
not be considered. It is addressed at the lattermost orientation of
the employee's move and close to the cumulative dollar total.

To be perfectly frank, my past experience as an executive with a
large Fortune 200 company leads me to believe that expenses which
have tangible value will be considered as foremost. The family will
forego the expense of radon testing and other "nuisance" expenses.
They do this so as to escape the burden of taxes.

Since we are so directly Involved, we point out the dangers of this
bill, H.R. 11. I believe we as the representatives of an industry, must
point out the detrimental health effects of this bill. Though the
profit motive is important, the paramount motive is to save lives.

Editor's Note: We contacted Mr. Collie, who told RND that the House
has already passed the bill, although, the Senate is considering
another, more favorable version. Contact Mr. Collie at 202-857-0857
for information on how you can help make sure radon-related issues
are not left out.

Dear Editor:

The United States Code of Federal Regulations includes an entire
section (10 CFR 20) devoted to both occupational and non-
occupational exposure to many forms of radiation. However, there is
not one mention of indoor radon exposure despite the fact that
radon-related research has produced the most complete body of
evidence that radon exposure causes lung cancer.

For miners, radiation is an occupational hazard. In an attempt to
minimize exposure, miners are restricted to a total yearly dose of 4
WLM and must wear respirators if the concentration of radon in the
mine reaches 16 pCi/l.

Although it is quite common for indoor radon levels to reach 16
pCi/l in many U.S. homes, government regulations offer more
protection from radiation exposure in mines than they do in our
homes.

Why is it that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission believes
occupational radiation exposure should be limited to 500 MREM per
year in nuclear facilities while residents of homes with a 4 pCi/l
radon level are allowed to receive over 650 MREM of exposure (12
hours per day in the home, 340 days per year)?

If regulations governing radiation exposure at nuclear power
facilities were applied to residential radon exposure the NRC policy
would make better sense. We must treat radon as the health hazard
that it is. And, according to the U.S. EPA, radon is a Group A
carcinogen with solid human data directly linking it to cancer.
