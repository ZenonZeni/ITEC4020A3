<p align="center"><b>Federal Representative Continues Probe Into
Potential Misuse Of Federal Power At Anti-NORML Demonstration</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, Washington, D.C.:</b>&nbsp; Rep.
Barney Frank (D-Mass.) continues to make federal waves in
response to a December 1995 rally held outside the offices of
Boston radio station WBCN to protest the airplay of the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD, Hempilation. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Having previously written to Attorney General Janet Reno this
winter both condemning the actions of rally organizers, the
Governors Alliance Against Drugs, and requesting an inquiry into whether
federal law enforcement officials were involved, Frank is again
pressuring the Attorney General to take action.&nbsp; &quot;I'm
writing to express my severe disappointment in the response I received
[from DEA Administrator Thomas Constantine] to a letter I sent
you in December about the conduct of the Drug Enforcement
Administration in an effort by officials of the state and federal government
to put inappropriate pressure on a radio station, and to do so in
an inappropriate manner,&quot; Frank asserts.&nbsp; &quot;The
response confirmed my fear that the Drng Enforcement Administration
does not have the respect for free expression which ought to
exist in the federal government, especially the Department of
Justice, charged as it is with the protection of constitutional
rights.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">According to eye-witness accounts, the Massachusetts based
anti-drug group, in cooperation with representatives from the DEA
and local law enforcement, organized and participated in a protest
outside the offices of WBCN Boston to voice their disapproval of
the station &quot;giving airtime&quot; to the <b>NORML</b>
benefit CD, Hempilation.&nbsp; Witnesses note that protesters
arrived in state vehicles, attendees were encouraged to
&quot;bring their squad cars,&quot; and that an individual
identified as the Boston liaison to the DEA accompanied Georgette
Watson, Executive Director of the G.A.A.D, as she entered the
station.&nbsp; This action prompted Bill Downing, president of
Mass Cann NORML, to charge that &quot;Th[is] sort of [behavior],
when performed by government agents, [is] specifically
[prohibited] by law. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It is one thing for government officials to express their
opinions as to what is appropriate behavior by radio
stations,&quot; writes Frank in his follow-up letter to Ms.
Reno.&nbsp; &quot;It is quite another for a law enforcement
official to arrive in these circumstances and participate in what
is clearly an effort to pressure them on the spot. ...&nbsp; We
are talking here about a situation where a law enforcement
officer - I assume armed with both a weapon and with the power of
arrest -- enters a radio station in the company of a state
official who has organized a demonstration and joins with her --
indeed at her specific request -- in trying to persuade people at
the station to stop playing certain music. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;My impression is that we do not have enough law enforcement
officials available to do actual law enforcement.&nbsp; Diverting
one of them to spend his time seeking to pressure radio stations
into changing their selections is it seems to me both a misuse of
scarce resources as well as a misuse of the authority of law
enforcement officials where people's first amendment rights are
involved.&nbsp; I therefore must ask that you promulgate policies
which prohibit law enforcement officials from engaging in this
sort of activity.&quot; <br>

<p align="center"><b>Modified Hemp Measure Becomes Law In Vermont</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 14, 1996, Montpelier, VT:</b>&nbsp; A bill
(H. 783) that could signal the first step in the establishment of
a domestic hemp industry in Vermont became law without the
signature of Gov. Howard Dean.&nbsp; However, hemp proponents
maintain that the approved measure falls short of the bill's
initial expectations and acknowledge that any chance for local
industrial hemp cultivation still remains far away. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Similar to a resolution recentiy approved in Hawaii, the revised
Vermont legislation allows for research to be conducted into the
feasibility of industrial hemp production, but removed language that
would have authorized the state university to grow test plots in
order to assess optimum soils and other growing conditions.&nbsp;
The bill is a &quot;compromise,&quot; admits Rep. Fred Maslack (R-Poultney),
one of the chief backers of the original bill.&nbsp; Maslack
notes that Gov. Dean would have vetoed any legislation that
allowed for the growing of hemp. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;It's a start,&quot; stated <b>NORML</b> Deputy Director
Allen St. Pierre.&nbsp; &quot;But it's also an indicator of just
how far we have to go.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">In sum, the approved measure maintains that: &quot;The commission
of agriculture, food and markets and the University of Vermont
are requested to undertake research, of a minimum of two years in duration,
of industrial hemp production in the state.&nbsp; [This research]
shall include: (1) Analysis of market economic conditions
affecting the development of an industrial hemp industry in the
state of Vermont; (2) Analysis of whether Vermont soils and
growing conditions are appropriate for economic levels of
industrial hemp production; (3) Analysis of research undertaken
elsewhere in the world regarding minimum THC levels of industrial
hemp production; and (4) Analysis of possible law enforcement
aspects of industrial hemp production in Vermont.&quot; <br>

Initiative Project (CO-HIP) @ (303) 784-5632 or Rep. Fred Maslack
@ (802) 287-9298.&nbsp; For more information on state efforts to
initiate domestic hemp cultivation, please contact either Allen St.
Pierre or Paul Armentano of NORML @ (202) 483-5500.</i></p>

<p align="center"><b>South Australia's Director Of Public
Prosecutions Recommends The State Grow Cannabis</b> </p>

<p align="left"><SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50"><b>May 1996, South Australia, Australia:</b>&nbsp;
The Director of Public Prosecutions in South Australia wants the
State government to grow and regulate the sale of cannabis,
according to statements he recently made in an exclusive
interview with the Australian publication, The Advertiser. <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">&quot;We never really had a chance [in trying to stop drug
use],&quot; Director Paul Rofe, QC, stated.&nbsp; &quot;We've
just got to do something drastic.&quot; <br>
<SPACER TYPE="HORIZONTAL" SIZE="50">Rofe maintains that criminal involvement in the cannabis trade
would be cut dramatically if the government were to either begin
growing the drug or issue licenses for its manufacture.&nbsp;
Rofe suggested implementing a regulatory system similar to those
already in place for the sale of alcohol and tobacco whereby
individuals could purchase marijuana over the counter.&nbsp; Such
a move would both eliminate illegal profits from the black-market
sale of the drug and would cut down on the &quot;underground&quot;
attraction of smoking cannabis, Rofe remarked. <br>
