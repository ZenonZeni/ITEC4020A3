MEDICUS administrators, Managed Care Consultants Ltd., negotiate procedural price limits with leading Private Hospitals throughout the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. These hospitals are selected on the basis of the quality of their medical facilities, accommodation and their geographical suitability. A MEDICUS client will normally be within easy reach of a Preferred Hospital. This pricing co-operation from the hospitals concerned greatly assists in controlling premium levels.
<p>
Under normal circumstances a client will attend one of these "Preferred Hospitals", which number over 100 but this will not be mandatory if the client has genuine medical reasons for needing to attend another hospital not on our list, providing that authorisation has been obtained from Managed Care Consultants Ltd. Apart from reducing premium levels, the use of Preferred Hospitals allows our client the benefit of direct billing and the assurance of quality accommodation and medical services. 
<p>
The use of Preferred Hospitals ensures our clients receive both the highest levels of comfort associated with private care, together with access to specialised medical centres when medical circumstances make this necessary. It enables us to give our clients better value for money today and help to control costs in the future.
<p>
<i>This system also allows access, without inpatient limits, 
to any hospital in the country on the basis of medical necessity.</i>
