bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <h1>Programs Available and Financial
Arrangements</h1> <p> Hospital Meridian provides a variety of
programs to accommodate individual needs.  These include 3-5 day
visits for rejuvenation or follow-up maintenance, as well as 3-6 week
programs of intensive therapy for more serious conditions.  All
hospital charges listed below are considered to be deposits against
reimbursement by useful private health insurance programs.<p>

Hospital Meridian charges include all standard therapies, normal lab
work, and most adjunctive therapies.  Some other hospitals may charge
a lower daily rate, but your billing for additional tests, adjunctive
therapies, and other services can often reach $1,000 per week.  At
Hospital Meridian, any extra charges are for extraordinary, high-cost
services such as Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation, Live Cell Therapy,
Surgical Procedures, or similar non-standard services.<p>

Our charges are $4,500 per week, or $700 per day for stays of less
than one week. We strongly encourage patients to bring a companion,
as it is very important to have a friend or family member learn
the therapy so that it may be continued at home. Patients who are
very ill or non-ambulatory may require an additional assistant, as
private nursing care is not provided.  The charge for a companion is
$44.00 per day, which includes a bed in the patient's room, 3 meals
and 3 juices.<p>

Payment may be made by cash, cashiers check, traveler's check,
American Express, Visa or MasterCard. A cash deposit of the first
week's charges will be required upon admission to the hospital.
Additional charges (if any) will be collected weekly in advance.<p>

<h3>Insurance Reimbursement:</h3>

Although Hospital Meridian does not accept insurance assignment,
Meridian Health Systems can process your health insurance claim to
assist you in receiving the maximum benefits allowable. For details,
contact the hospital administrator.  Hospital Meridian is located
just 30 minutes from downtown San Diego, California.<p>
