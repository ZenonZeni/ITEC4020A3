<h2>
<a name="RTFToC2">Clinton's
Budget Targets </a></a></a>Illegal
Immigration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>President Clinton's proposed federal budget for 1996, released February 6,
1995, includes a $1 billion increase in immigration-related spending, raising
it from $2.6 billion in FY 95 to $3.6 billion in 1996.  Most of the additional
funds would go to the INS, which would see its budget rise 27 percent to $2.6
billion, to prevent illegal entries and to detect and deport unauthorized
aliens in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>There were an estimated four million illegal aliens in the US in October
1994, and their number is believed to be increasing by 300,000 each year, or
25,000 per month.  About 40 percent of these settled illegal aliens are
Mexicans.  An average 2,000 to 2,500 aliens are apprehended daily along the
US-Mexican border.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton's budget would add 700 Border Patrol agents to the current 5,000
and provide $300 million to states to cover their costs of incarcerating
criminal aliens, $100 million to reimburse states for the costs of educating
illegal alien children, and $150 million to reimburse states for the costs of
providing emergency medical services to unauthorized aliens.  California alone
is requesting $3 billion from the federal government, and other states are
demanding $5 billion more.</tt><p>
<tt>The administration is also proposing steps to speed up the deportation of
aliens who have been convicted of crimes in the US.  There were 37,000 criminal
aliens deported in 1993, 22,000 in 1994, and the administration is expected to
increase criminal deportations to 58,000 in 1996. </tt><p>
<tt>There are an estimated 77,000 criminal illegal aliens in federal and state
prisons.  If they are released before being deported, many fail to leave the
US--about 20 percent of those ordered deported are released before receiving a
final deportation order.  There are believed to be about 100,000 illegal aliens
who have been convicted of crimes in the US, served their sentences in the US,
been ordered deported, but are nonetheless here.</tt><p>
<tt>Senator Simpson's immigration control bill (S269) gives the president eight
years to establish a system to verify the eligibility of every new worker hired
and every applicant for public benefits.  Simpson's bill directs the attorney
general to establish a data base that could be used to establish eligibility.
The cost of establishing such a registry has been estimated at $3 to $6
billion, primarily to clean up the Social Security and INS data bases.</tt><p>
<tt>Under Clinton's original proposal, some of the additional immigration
control funds would have been raised by a $3 per car and $1.50 per pedestrian
border entry fee at the 169 border crossings between the US and Canada and
Mexico.  There were 409 million legal land entries into the US in 1993, and the
fees were expected to raise $200 million in 1996, and then $400 million per
year.  </tt><p>
<tt>The border crossing fee had supporters and detractors in Congress.  Over 20
border-area Congressmembers<b> </b>released a letter asserting that a border
crossing fee would in fact be a tax that would slow traffic and hurt border
businesses, contrary to the spirit of NAFTA.  According to San Diego critics,
Mexicans in the Tijuana area, many of whom now make trips to the US every two
to four days, would find it too costly and time consuming to enter.  Opponents
also assert that traffic congestion at ports of entry could worsen air
pollution there.  </tt><p>
<tt>Opposition from Canada and Mexico, as well as border state politicians, led
Clinton to withdraw the border crossing fee proposal on February 22.  States
will be given the option of adopting the border crossing fee and, if they do,
they will share the funds raised to do additional immigration control and
border infrastructure projects.</tt><p>
<tt>A representative for California Governor Pete Wilson said that Clinton's
proposals offer only a "Band-Aid solution" that ignores the passage of Prop.
187 in California.  An attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund criticized the Clinton proposals for failing to provide funds
to promote of the naturalization of immigrants. </tt><p>
<tt>The House of Representatives, on February 10, 1995, approved by a vote of
380-20 revisions to the 1994 crime bill that expands the list of crimes for
which illegal immigrants can be deported, and speeds up their deportation.  The
Criminal Alien Deportation Improvements Act also includes provisions that raise
penalties for smuggling aliens into the US from today's average 18 months
imprisonment and $5,000 fine to up to 20 years in prison and triple<b>
</b>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) damages, which could
total millions.</tt><p>
<tt>On February 25, the US Drug Czar announced that Operation Hard Line would
immediately prompt INS and US Customs to more frequently inspect cars entering
the US for drugs.  Some 80 US Customs inspectors will be transferred to the
US-Mexican border, and US helicopters will be permitted to take Mexican police
to places inside Mexico where drugs are loaded onto trucks headed into the
US.</tt><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC3">Budget
Bolsters Interior Enforcement</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Clinton's FY 96 budget requests $93 million, a 29 percent increase, in
additional funds for interior enforcement.  Under a proposal to target
enforcement on industries and employers likely to violate labor and immigration
laws, Clinton's budget proposal calls for 365 additional INS inspectors to
double checks for illegal aliens in US workplaces, and 202 additional DOL wage
and hour inspectors to increase by 65 percent inspections in workplaces likely
to employ unauthorized workers, such as garment makers, construction firms,
agriculture and food services.  </tt><p>
<tt>These additional inspectors would be concentrated in the seven states with
the most illegal aliens--California, Texas, Arizona, New Jersey, New York,
Florida, and Illinois.  If the budget increase is approved by Congress, the
number of illegal aliens detected in the workplace is expected to double.
</tt><p>
<tt>In 1994, 1,400 of the 2,200 employers investigated by INS for hiring
illegal aliens were issued fines totaling $11 million; 4,400 investigations are
planned for 1996.  In 1993, when the INS had 318 sanctions enforcement agents,
it completed nearly 1,800 cases against employers that resulted in fines.
There was a backlog of 36,000 leads of employers possibly employing illegal
aliens in September 1994. </tt><p>
<tt>INS and DOL data report different levels of employer compliance with
checking on the legal status of all new hires and refusing to hire illegal
aliens.  The INS reports that 90 percent of all employers inspected are in
compliance, and DOL reports about 50 percent employer compliance.  INS data
reflect violations only after an employer has been given a chance to correct
mistakes, while DOL data do not.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton's budget proposal would also permit a significant expansion of the
telephone verification system, whereby 200 employers in 1995 call in the Social
Security and immigration numbers of their new hires to INS.  The number of
employers using this system is expected to increase to 700 in 1996.</tt><p>
<tt>Clinton's proposal would also provide $28 million for a pilot worker
verification system.  The pilot worker registry would permit a test of several
ways to combine INS and Social Security data in major immigration states so
that employers could quickly verify a worker's legal status.</tt><p>
<tt>The INS is planning to reduce from the current 29 documents to 16 the
documents that workers can present to employers to establish their legal right
to work in the US.  An estimated 50 percent of all illegal aliens working in
the US present fraudulent documents to employers.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">Calls
for Guest Workers
Mount</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></h2>
<tt>On February 6, 1995, California Attorney General Dan Lungren called for a
guest worker (companero) program that would permit Mexican workers to be "free
agent" workers in the US.  The workers would be protected in the US, according
to Lungren, by the right to change employers, and induced to return by having
10 to 25 percent of their US earnings deducted in a manner that they could
re-claim only upon their return to Mexico.  </tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles Times editorial page manager Frank del Olmo argued in a January
31, 1995 Op-Ed in the newspaper that a guest worker program is the "least bad"
means to control illegal immigration.  He too called for withholding part of
the alien workers' pay to induce their return, and argued that the increased
sophistication of the workers and media attention would prevent abuses.</tt><p>
<tt>INS Commissioner Doris Meissner argued strongly against a guest worker
program, calling it a short-term fix that produces long-term problems and
distortions.  Meissner argued that guest workers are inherently exploitable,
and that the notion that a country can add workers to its labor force and not
residents to its population is fundamentally flawed.</tt><p>
<tt>However, agricultural interests in February 1995 made the rounds in
Congress, laying the groundwork for a proposal to introduce a non-H2A foreign
farm worker program.  Their success in securing an alternative to the then H-2
program in the early 1980s has led to speculation that farmers may be even more
successful in today's Congress.</tt><p>
<tt>A decade ago, when the ample supply of unskilled farm labor was threatened
by employer sanctions, the debate over guest workers centered on how to
determine whether there was a "need" for foreign workers, meaning that issues
such as how soon before workers were needed must the US employer request help
from the US Employment Service to find US workers, what wages and benefits had
to be offered to them, and how to handle complaints that US employers find
American workers unqualified.  The 1995 calls for guest workers, by contrast,
downplays whether foreigners are needed, and focuses on measures to assure that
any foreign workers admitted will in fact return to their countries of origin.
</tt><p>
<tt>Programs that aim to add workers to the labor force without adding
permanent residents to the population have produced one of the few "principles
of migration"--there is nothing more permanent than temporary foreign workers.
Countries initiate guest worker programs for four major reasons: to alleviate
labor shortages, to better manage inevitable migration, to provide
work-and-learn opportunities, and to promote socio-economic integration.  Guest
worker programs generate economic, migration management, and development
benefits, but they also create distortion costs in the labor importing
country's economy and labor market, as well as creating a dependency that leads
everywhere to some leakage from temporary to permanent settlement.</tt><p>
<tt>Past guest worker programs attempted to use rules and regulations to manage
economically-motivated migration that, in turn, changed the economies of
sending and receiving areas.  Asian countries are pioneering economic
instruments to manage migration, such as levying a tax on employers who hire
guest workers and requiring the guest workers to deposit 30 to 50 percent of
their earnings in savings accounts that they can reclaim only in their country
of origin.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC5">Evaluating
Stepped-Up Border
Controls</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported in January 1995 that INS
efforts to deter the entry of illegal aliens at the border rather than
apprehend them in the US seem to be working.  Beginning with Operation Hold the
Line in El Paso, followed by Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego and Operation
Safeguard in Arizona, the INS has installed steel fences along the border and
massed agents there to discourage attempted entries.  </tt><p>
<tt>In El Paso, there were 8,000 to 10,000 Mexicans entering El Paso daily in
December 1993, when the INS launched Operation Hold the Line by moving 400
agents to the border to try to prevent illegal entries.  Apprehensions have
since fallen by 73 percent, and the fence has been repaired and fortified to
become a formidable obstacle.  </tt><p>
<tt>In San Diego, by contrast, Operation Gatekeeper on October 1, 1994 sought
to push aliens attempting illegal entry from the western six miles of border to
the eastern 60 miles, where mountains and desert make detection and
apprehension easier.  Aliens were deterred at the western border by a fence,
lights, and then three tiers of Border Patrol agents.  Apprehensions first
fell, but rose by 18 percent in January 1995 versus January 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Five Republican California congressman called for the Border Patrol to
abandon its three-tier strategy in San Diego and move all the agents to the
border, similar to the El Paso blockade.  The Border Patrol has begun moving
agents closer to the border as a visible deterrent, but Border Patrol officials
say their "push them east" strategy remains intact.  The Border Patrol argues
that a saturate-the-line approach would not work in San Diego because of the
terrain differences and the desperation of the crossers.  There is also concern
that this desperateness might lead to violence against Border Patrol agents.
</tt><p>
<tt>The GAO concluded that the prevention strategy reduced apprehensions,
crime, and Border Patrol-alien confrontations, and enjoyed strong public
support in the areas where it was tried.  In addition, INS believes that some
Mexicans in the interior of the country are deterred by reports of more agents
on the border.</tt><p>
<tt>However, there is also evidence that aliens attempting illegal entries may
have shifted from e.g., El Paso and San Diego to Arizona, where apprehensions
doubled between January 1994 and 1995.  There is also limited evidence that the
price of being smuggled into the US--often the most reliable indicator of
supply and demand in illegal markets--has risen, but not as much as might have
been expected--from $200 to $300 to be smuggled to Los Angeles to $250 to
$400.</tt><p>
<tt>There were 1.3 million apprehensions by the Border Patrol in FY93, and one
million in 1994.  The number of enforcement hours was stable at about 8.8
million. </tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican border crimes task force expects an average of 30,000 crossing
attempts per month.  Smugglers sometimes lead aliens on "banzai runs" up
Interstate 5 south of San Diego; 120 people have been killed since 1985 running
on or near border freeways in the San Diego area.</tt><p>
<tt>Along Mexico's southern border, a special operation will target the
smuggling of US-bound non-Mexicans. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC6">Legal
Immigration and Naturalization in 1994</a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Legal immigration fell about 10 percent in FY 94, to 800,000 from 880,000
(excluding aliens legalized under IRCA).  There were 24,000 fewer
employment-based immigrants admitted, 15,000 fewer unmarried sons and daughters
of US citizens, and 21,000 fewer dependents of legalized aliens.  </tt><p>
<tt>Citizenship applications have increased dramatically, especially in the
five-county area around Los Angeles.  Government officials believe that a
combination of fear, convenience and increased political awareness are
responsible for the rise. There were 423,000 naturalizations in 1994, compared
to 314,681 in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>In California, more than 110,000 aliens became naturalized US citizens in
FY94, twice the usual number.  In Los Angeles alone, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service approved 13,259 applications for citizenship in October
and November 1994.  During the same two months of 1993, the Los Angeles
district, which includes Orange, Ventura, and Riverside counties, approved only
5,510 applications for naturalization.  </tt><p>
<tt>INS officials can interview no more than 600 naturalization applicants
daily,  which means that there is an average six month wait between filing
papers and participating in a naturalization ceremony.  Anyone who has been in
the US legally for five years is eligible to apply for US citizenship. Most of
the three million aliens who were legalized in 1987-88 under IRCA's
legalization programs now qualify to apply for US citizenship.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC7">Peso
Devaluation, US and Mexican Jobs, and
Migration</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The Mexican peso fell from $1=5.4&nbsp;pesos on February 1 to $1=6 pesos on
February 28.  Many businesses in Mexico came to a near standstill because of
foreign-exchange losses, sales declines, and a loss of confidence.  By one
estimate, as many as 250,000 jobs, equivalent to 1 percent of Mexico's
employment, and 2.5 percent of formal sector employment, have been lost since
December.  Most of the auto companies in Mexico, for example, closed their
assembly lines temporarily because of expected sales declines of 30 to 50
percent in 1995; consumer durables sales are down as a result of consumer
interest rates of 60 to 70 percent.  </tt><p>
<tt>Many Mexican companies are expected to go bankrupt and lay off their
workers as the Mexican economy shrinks by perhaps two or three percent in 1995.
Some foreign investors that had announced expansions or new facilities in
Mexico put their plans on hold; total foreign investment in Mexico fell 22
percent in 1994, with most of the decline in the last 10 days of the year,
although direct foreign investment in factories and equipment rose over 60
percent.</tt><p>
<tt>Under the US  aid plan withdrawn on January 31, Mexico would have deposited
the roughly $7 billion per year it earns from oil exports in the US Federal
Reserve Bank, so that the US could keep the money if Mexico defaulted on the
loans that Clinton proposed.  However, Congress proved unwilling to approve the
$40 billion loan guarantee plan because it would allegedly also be bailing out
US and foreign investors who had pumped billions of dollars into Mexico.
Private capital flows to developing countries world wide have quadrupled since
1989, from about $40 billion to $160 billion in 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Dallas Federal Reserve Bank estimated that a 40 percent peso
devaluation would result in 20,000 to 30,000 lost US jobs, due both to lower US
exports to Mexico and increased illegal Mexican immigration.  The US exported
goods worth about $49 billion to Mexico in 1994 and, since each $50,000 in
exports is assumed to support one US job, this implies that about one million
US workers had jobs in 1994 that depended on exports to Mexico.  If exports to
Mexico fall by $10 billion in 1995, there would be 100,000 lost US jobs--actual
job losses would be less because some of the goods not exported to Mexico could
be exported elsewhere.</tt><p>
<tt>Some 36,000 US workers have filed claims with the US Department of Labor
asserting that they lost their jobs because of NAFTA-inspired trade increases.
In January, 24 members of the US House of Representatives sponsored a bill that
calls on the US to withdraw from NAFTA.</tt><p>
<tt>As apprehensions of illegal aliens increased, there continued to be
second-guessing on how much illegal immigration will be prevented by US aid for
Mexico.  Apprehensions were up in January in Texas and Arizona, and down in San
Diego.  Commentators such as Patrick Buchanan argued that adding just $1
billion of the aid to the US Border Patrol budget would do far more to prevent
illegal immigration than providing loans and loan guarantees.</tt><p>
<tt>Many in Congress had demanded that, as a condition of receiving US aid,
Mexico must "cooperate" with the US to reduce drug trafficking and illegal
immigration.  At the second meeting of the Bilateral Commission on February 13
and 14, 1995 in Zacatecas, Mexico pledged to double the Grupo Beta border
police unit that fights smuggling and drug trafficking on the Mexican side of
the border.  </tt><p>
<tt>Mexico also agreed to begin a joint pilot program to repatriate illegal
immigrants from San Diego to the Mexican interior.  In Texas, two new Grupo
Beta units will be formed and a struggling Grupo Beta unit in Arizona will be
reorganized.  Mexico also reorganized its National Migration Institute, and
announced that its migration policies would be based on the three principles of
border enforcement; immigration that benefits Mexico; and protecting the human
rights of all persons in Mexico regardless of their legal status.</tt><p>
<tt>Mexico strongly denied that it would block its side of the border to
prevent illegal migration to the US in exchange for aid.  Despite a provision
of the Mexican constitution that permits Mexicans to leave the country only at
authorized ports of exit, a Mexican official asserted that Mexican law
prohibits police from stopping persons leaving the country.<b></b></tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>The General Accounting Office on February 2, 1995 released a report that
concluded that immigrants are twice as likely as US citizens received benefits
from the Supplemental Security Income and Aid to Families with Dependent
Children programs  in 1993.  Half of the immigrant recipients of SSI and AFDC
are in California, which had 38 percent of all immigrants in the March 1994
Current Population Survey (CPS).  Immigrants received an estimated $3.3 billion
of the $24 billion in SSI benefits in 1993, and $1.2 billion of the $22 billion
in AFDC payments.</tt><p>
<tt>Both the Clinton Administration and the Republicans "Contract with America"
would reduce the eligibility of aliens for these benefit programs.  Currently,
legal immigrants, refugees, asylum applicants, and certain other PRUCOL
(persons residing under color of law) aliens are eligible to apply for these
benefits.  However, US immigration law permits aliens seeking entry to be
excluded if they are likely to become a public charge.  An alien can pledge to
be self-sufficient by providing proof of sufficient personal resources, a job
offer that offers a sufficient wage, post a bond, and/or have a US resident
sponsor sign an affidavit that promises to support the alien if necessary.
</tt><p>
<tt>It is estimated that 90 percent or more of the family-sponsored immigrants
admitted to the US obtain bonds from US residents in which the US sponsor
promises to support the immigrant if he/she cannot support him/her self.
Several courts have ruled that these affidavits of support are not binding on
the US resident.  For this reason, sponsorship rules were changed to require
that, if a sponsored immigrant applies for SSI or AFDC benefits after arrival,
a portion of the sponsor's income and other resources will be "deemed" to be
available to the immigrant as part of their income in determining whether the
immigrant is eligible for benefits.  This deeming period is three years after
arrival for sponsored immigrants applying for AFDC, and five years for
immigrants applying for SSI.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration's proposal would extend the deeming period for
both SSI and AFDC to five years, and maintain the eligibility for cash
assistance of current recipients.  The House Republicans proposal would, one
year after enactment, make all aliens ineligible for AFDC and SSI for six years
after their arrival, except for refugees and aliens 75 and older who have lived
in the US at least five years.</tt><p>
<tt>If access to benefits were restricted as proposed by the Clinton
Administration, program savings may be $1 to $5 billion annually; the House
proposal might result in program savings of $2.5 billion annually.  Savings
estimates are difficult to make because aliens denied federal benefits may turn
to state and local government programs, naturalize, turn to sponsors for
support, or not immigrate.</tt><p>
<tt>The IRS is checking the validity of claims for refunds that low-earners can
receive under the Earned Income Tax Credit.  The EITC is a negative income tax,
paying up to $306 to single workers, and $2,528 to a family with two or more
children.  About 15 million people in 1994 received $20 billion EITC on their
1993 earnings, including 2.2 million receiving $2.3 billion in California.  The
average payment nationwide is about $1200.</tt><p>
<tt>There has been a sharp growth in the number of Hispanic-surnamed persons
filing for EITC in California, prompting speculation that immigrants are
applying. Nancy Bolton of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project obtained data
on tax returns in 1989 and 1992, and found that there was a 12 percent increase
in the number of Hispanic households filing California tax returns, and that
their mean income fell by 13 percent to $20,629 in 1992.  Mean Asian household
incomes in California, by contrast, were $33,266 in 1992, and mean non-Hispanic
white incomes were $40,443.</tt><p>

<tt>California state attorneys on February 3, 1995 asked Federal Judge Pfaelzer
to dismiss the challenge to the constitutionality of Prop. 187 or to stop
federal consideration of Prop. 187 until state courts rule on its
validity.</tt><p>
<tt>On February 8, 1995, a California state court issued an injunction that
prevents California colleges and universities from inquiring about the legal
status of the estimated 13,600 illegal alien students, most attending
California community colleges, until a full trial on Prop. 187's provisions is
held in June 1995. </tt><p>
<tt>On February 13, 1995, a<b> </b>U.S. District judge dismissed California's
lawsuit demanding $2.4 billion per year from the federal government for the
cost of providing services to illegal aliens.  California's $56 billion annual
budget for FY95-96 assumes that the federal government will provide $732
million to reimburse it for the costs of services provided to unauthorized
immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>In Florida, where an estimated seven percent of the state's 14 million
people are unauthorized aliens, two groups are gathering signatures for a Prop.

not expected in Texas because the state does not have an initiative process.

<tt>The 28,000 Cubans who left their island nation during the summer of 1994
and remain in US custody are now housed in tent cities at the US base in
Guantanamo, Cuba.  Under a September 9, 1994 agreement, Cuba halted the exodus
of migrants, and the US promised to admit at least 20,000 Cuban immigrants
annually, but only from among those who applied to immigrate to the US in Cuba.
Over 200,000 Cubans have applied to migrate to the US in Havana.</tt><p>
<tt>The Clinton Administration says it will allow family members to visit the

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC12">British
Uproar over </a></a></a></a></a>Abolition of EU Border Controls</a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>On March 26, 1995, the seven signatories of the Schengen Agreement
(Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemboug, Spain and Portugal) will
abolish border controls between their countries.  Jacques Santer, president of
the EU Executive Commission, said that the EU continues to remain committed to
the free moment of people.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain heads the EU nations seeking to preserve national border controls,
for historic reasons that it traces to its island mentality and its tradition
of independence.  A junior minister in charge of British immigration affairs
brought the issue to a head in mid-February, when he resigned to protest the
possible loss of Britain's right to control entry over its borders. British
government lawyers reportedly asserted that the opt-out of no borders
negotiated by former Prime Minister Thatcher would not prevail if the European
Commission were to take Britain to the European Court of Justice.</tt><p>
<tt>Other government officials and Prime Minister John Major asserted that
Britain has the right to maintain border controls.  Major was particularity
upset that the junior minister raised the specter of millions of immigrants
flooding into the country.  European officials say that Germany, the richest EU
nation, is the real magnet for immigrants, not Britain.</tt><p>
<tt>Britain has seen the proportionately largest outflow of population to the
rest of the EU in the past 20 years.  British citizens are the largest
expatriate communities in Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece. The British
expatriate community in  France  has doubled since 1973,  from 25,000 to
50,000, and in Germany there are 100,000 Britons, more than ever despite a
declining military presence.</tt><p>
<tt>In part to offset fears of being swamped by immigrants, the British Home
Secretary announced on February 16 that an extra 12,000 asylum seekers per year
would be expelled from Britain, and that measures would be taken to streamline
the asylum process.  Eighty percent of the asylum applications are rejected,
five percent are granted refugee status, and 15 percent are granted exceptional
leave to stay on compassionate grounds.  The main countries of origin of
applicants in 1994 were Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Ghana.  Most of those
who received asylum were from Iraq, Iran and Turkey.</tt><p>
<tt>The British Immigration Office disagrees with the number of immigrants
reported by the Home Office.  The Home Office says that the total number of
immigrants in 1993 was 55,640, only a slight increase over the 52,790 in 1992
and 53,900 in 1990. The number of immigrants who have been removed, either by
deportation or after formal warnings, also remained stable at about 6,000 each
year in the 1990s.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Immigration Office believes that these data understate illegal
immigration.  The Immigration Service Union believes that, including illegal
entrants would triple immigration to 150,000 per year. </tt><p>
<tt>Concern has been raised that the opening of the Eurotunnel has also opened
a new door for illegal immigrants into Britain.  Police have caught 120 illegal
immigrants since limited service began a few months ago; they are prepared for
a massive influx as service increases.</tt><p>
<tt>An important part of the Schengen agreement was the establishment of a
computerized database that will contain information on asylum, illegal
immigrants, and persons with criminal records.  Agreements that permit police
to pursue illegals across borders, and to request surveillance on suspects in
other countries, is scheduled to become effective in 1995.</tt><p>
<tt>With the implementation of the Schengen agreement, the German government
will supply an additional 500 border police to the southwestern state of
Baden-Wurttemberg.  According to the Baden-Wurttemberg Interior Ministry, 1,665
people were apprehended trying to enter Germany illegally from France in the
first eight months of 1994.  Most of the illegal immigrants  are Albanians from
Kosovo.  These numbers are expected to rise dramatically after March 26, when
border controls are abolished.  German officials are also concerned that
Islamic activists, in trouble in France, will seek shelter in Germany.  Some
Algerian fundamentalists already have a base near Cologne.</tt><p>
<tt>The IOM estimates that there are 1.5 to 3 million illegal or clandestine
workers in Western Europe, including 300,000 to 500,000 Albanians in Greece and
Italy, or 10 percent of Albania's labor force.  Most find jobs, sometimes with
the help of labor smugglers, in construction, agriculture, non-durables
manufacturing such as garments, and hotels and restaurants.</tt><p>
<tt>A report released on February 22 by the European Council on Refugees and
Exiles, "Safe Third Country, Myths and Realities," reports that EU member
countries are violating the Geneva Convention principle of "non refoulement."
The report claims that thousands of refugees are being expelled from the EU
every month without any attempt to hear their asylum case. </tt><p>
<tt>The ERCE General Secretary asserted that EU member-nations should not have
signed the London Convention in 1992 because it declares that asylum seekers
who travel through "safe" countries can be deported.  This may result in a
deportation chain, in which the asylum seeker is sent back to the country from
which he or she fled persecution. </tt><p>
<tt>According to the ERCE, in one six Somali nationals who arrived in Belgium
on May 29, 1994 were deported to the Czech Republic, then to Slovakia, and then
to the Ukraine, the first nation they transited.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC13">Dual
Citizenship Initiative Fails in Germany</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Green party in Germany's Bundestag introduced a bill to permit dual
citizenship, but they were unable to secure sufficient support to have it
considered seriously.  The bill would have granted German citizenship to
children born of settled foreigners in Germany, a position advocated by
government's commissioner for foreigners, Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen, who wants
naturalization laws now based on descent to be changed.</tt><p>
<tt>Currently, foreign children may apply for citizenship if one parent has
German citizenship. Otherwise, they may gain German citizenship by satisfying
residence and other requirements and by renouncing their citizenship of
birth.</tt><p>
<tt>Every year tens of thousands of people try to cross the Oder River
illegally that separates Poland and Germany.  About 60 percent of those who
cross the Oder are Romanians.  Most rely on smugglers (Schleppers) to sneak
them across the river. If the would-be immigrants are not detected by German
radar, hunting dogs, and helicopters, they will usually be led by a Schlepper
12 miles along a dirt road to Eisenhuettenstadt, and then to Berlin to find
work on building sites or in hotels and restaurants. </tt><p>
<tt>Being smuggled to Germany typically costs DM1,500 ($1,000), of which DM300
must be paid in advance, and the rest during the first few months of the
immigrant's stay in Germany, according to the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS).  The BGS
is more concerned about a wave of immigrants from Russia, where passports to
travel abroad will be freely available after June, 1995, than the end of border
controls with Schengen.  Fewer than one per cent of the illegal  immigrants
apprehended apply for asylum.</tt><p>
<tt>For the second time, the German Interior Minister has extended its freeze
on the deportation of Kurdish refugees to allow a parliamentary committee
hearing on the issue.  Bonn would like to speed up deportations to discourage
asylum seekers, but it wants to ensure the safety of the Kurds in Turkey.  A
Turkish court recently imposed jail terms on eight Kurdish deputies for
comments they made in support of Kurd's in Turkey's  Parliament. </tt><p>
<tt>Norway continues to return Turkish refugees who have been denied asylum to
Turkey.  In 1994, 30 Turkish nationals, mostly Kurdish, requested asylum in
Norway.  Only one was granted asylum.  </tt><p>
<tt>Norway rejects most of those western Turkey, while those from southeast
Turkey -- where Kurdish separatists are fighting the Turkish army -- are most
often granted asylum.  There are large numbers of Kurdish refugees living in
makeshift camps around Istanbul and Ankara.  Human rights organizations do not
agree that Kurds are safe in around these Turkish cities. </tt><p>
<tt>In a ruling by the Court of the Justice of the European Union on February
14, 1995, Germany was ordered to change its method of taxing border commuters
and immigrants.  A Belgian national named Schumacker commuted to a job in
Germany, and Germany required him to pay taxes there as a single worker, even
though he was married and his wife was unemployed.  If he were considered a
German resident, his wife's status would have been recognized, and he would
have been able to deduct certain work-related expenses from his income.</tt><p>
<tt>The Germans argued that the discrimination against Schumacker was based on
residence and not on nationality, so that Schumacker could not challenge it
under Regulation 1612/68 of the October 15, 1968 on free movement of workers,
which stipulates in Article 7 that workers in one Member States who are
nationals of another are eligible for the same tax advantages as national
workers.  The Court found that "non-residents are usually non-nationals," so
that Germany's failure to take into account Schumacker's family situation in
levying taxes was a form of discrimination based on national origin.</tt><p>

<tt></tt><p>
<tt>On February 21, 1995, supporters of the National Front, while posting
campaign signs, killed in unclear circumstances a 17-year old son of an African
immigrant in Marseilles.  National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen deplored but
did not condemn the killing, possibly hurting his chances in France's
presidential balloting this spring.  The first election is April 23, and the
run-off May 7.  According to La Pen, his supporters are instructed not to put
up signs at night, and not to carry arms.</tt><p>
<tt>Interior Minister Charles Pasqua warned that the world faced a campaign of
destabilization by Muslim.  Pasqua called on "democrats" in Algeria to hold
firm.</tt><p>
<tt>French officials fear that the fall of the Algerian government might
produce a mass exodus to France.  The populations of Algeria, Morocco and
Tunisia are young--more than half their population are below the age of 25--and
have high  unemployment rates-- 50 percent in Algeria. <b></b></tt><p>
<tt><b></b>Income gaps between Europe and North Africa are widening.  In 1992,
per capita GDP in France was $22,260, versus $1840 in Algeria, $1030 in
Morocco, and $$1720 in Tunisia.  The populations of the Maghreb are projected
to grow from 60 million in 1992, about the same as France's 57 million, to 83
to 86 million in 2010. </tt><p>
<tt>French officials report that the number of people deported from France in
1994 rose 53 percent to 11,400; another 566 were expelled, at a total cost to
the French taxpayer $18 million.  According to the head of French immigration,
illegal immigrants, once mainly from the France's former colonies in Africa, in
1994 included nationals of Turkey, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and even
China and Sri Lanka.  Increased illegal immigration is blamed on smugglers,
especially Asians, who supply illegal labor for leather and construction
industries. </tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC15">Immigration
in Austria</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Freedom Party (FPO) leader Joerg Haider announced plans for a "Citizens 98"
movement to break the postwar grip of Austria's two mainstream parties.  The
Freedom Party, which got 23 percent of the vote in the October 1994 election,
wants to end immigration to Austria.  Haider has said that stopping illegal
immigration will be the central platform in his party's campaign to take power
in 1998, the next scheduled general election. </tt><p>
<tt>According to Haider, there are 250,000 illegal aliens in Austria, and "The
safety of our streets is directly linked to the problem of illegal aliens in
Austria."</tt><p>
<tt>Austria's immigration control problem stems primarily from its geography;
it has an easily crossed and unpatrolled border with Slovenia.  Austria joined
the EU January 1, 1995, and when Austria abolishes border controls with Germany
and Italy as part of the Schengen agreement, border controls with non-Schengen
nations will be increased.</tt><p>
<tt>Gypsies in Austria are the latest victims of racial terrorism in Austria.
On February 5, four of the 117 Gypsies in the small village of Oberwert, 75
miles south of Vienna, were killed by a pipe bomb hidden by a sign that read
"Gypsies Go Back to India." One day later, another bomb with the sign "Go back
to Dalmatia (a reference to a Croatian region) was found near a school. </tt><p>
<tt>A neo-Nazi group has taken responsibility for both bombs.  In 1993, the
Austrian government recognized about 5,000 of the estimated 20,000 gypsies in
the country as an official minority.  There are an estimated six million
gypsies in Europe. </tt><p>
<tt>The Austrian government has changed its quota of foreign workers from nine
percent to eight percent of a firm's employees.  An initiative was proposed in
the Austrian parliament in late January guaranteeing work permits to Bosnian
refugees and the foreign children of international managers, although the quota
of such permits for 1995 is already exceeded. At the same time, the number of
guest workers from the EU has already increased by 20,000; EU workers do not
need a permit in order to work in Austria. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of foreigners (workers, self-employed, family members,
pensioners) entering Austria is limited to 17,000 in 1995 (14,900 in 1994).

Mass Migration From
Russia</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></></a></a></h2>
<tt>When the USSR broke up, about 75 million citizens of ex-USSR nations lived
outside their republic of birth.  Some Russian leaders used the threat of mass
emigration as a means to induce Western nations to provide aid in the early
1990s.</tt><p>
<tt>However, the threat of mass migration from a region that had very high
rates of labor force participation and very low population growth was never
credible, according to some experts.  There is a steady emigration from Russia
of about 100,000 ethnic Germans, Jews, and Greeks each month, but Russia is a
net immigration area.  For example, so-called "shabai" are illegal Ukrainian
workers in Russia who work at Moscow construction jobs for up to $200 per
month, even though the prevailing local wage is just $50 per month.  However,
these illegal aliens in Russia have no residence permits and thus no access to
government housing or benefits such as health care.  </tt><p>
<tt>About three million of the estimated 25 million Russians outside Russia
have returned within the past three years.  For example, Kazakhs are only 40
percent of Kazakhstan's 17 million people, but with salaries only $25 per
month, and priority for "good" state jobs going to Kazakhs, many Russian
professionals think that their only hope is to emigrate. </tt><p>
<tt>The Ukraine and Russia dropped the issue of dual citizenship when they
signed a friendship treaty on February 8.  The Ukraine strongly objects to
Russian proposals that the Ukraine grant dual citizenship on demand, fearing
that a large Russian minority could gain political power.</tt><p>

Refugees To Be Repatriated</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>Vietnam agreed during a February 23, 1995 meeting of  31 nations in Kuala
Lumpur to permit the repatriation of up to 3,600 Vietnamese boat people each
month.  The delegates also decided to maintain the December, 1995 deadline by
which all Vietnamese asylum seekers throughout Asia should be repatriated.  An
exception, until early 1996, was made for Hong Kong, which has more than half
of the 45,000 boat people in the Southeast Asia.  The plan must still be
approved at the Comprehensive Plan of Action Steering Committee meeting in
Geneva on March 16. </tt><p>
<tt>Voluntary repatriation is the goal for the 23,000 Vietnamese still in Hong
Kong, though over 1,000 boat people have been forced onto flights to Vietnam
since 1991, according the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The US
has been reluctant to support forced repatriation.  Forced repatriation
agreements have been signed with all first asylum countries expect Thailand.
Vietnamese asylum seekers in the Philippines have threatened to commit suicide
rather than be sent back to Vietnam.</tt><p>
<tt>At the meeting, China announced that the Hong Kong will be not serve as the
port of first asylum after 1997.  No asylum seekers have ever been turned away
from Hong Kong.</tt><p>
<tt>There are 80,000 Vietnamese in Germany, about half of whom have essentially
an immigrant status in the former West Germany.  There were also about 11,000
Vietnamese in the former Eastern Germany.  Some 20,000 Vietnamese have applied
for asylum in Germany, but only about 200 have been granted refugee status.
</tt><p>
<tt>In January 1995, Germany and Vietnam reached an agreement under which
Germany will provide DM 100 million per year and Vietnam will agree to accept
its repatriated citizens.  The agreement does not rule out forcible
repatriation.</tt><p>
<tt>During a three-day visit to Vietnam on January 18, Cambodia's First Prime
Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, promised Vietnam that there would be not
mass expulsions of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia.  Cambodia also agreed to
begin talks in February on what to do about Vietnamese residents in Cambodia.
</tt><p>
<tt>Vietnam estimates that 150,000 Vietnamese live in Cambodia--some have lived
there for generations. The Cambodian government says up to one million
Vietnamese live in the country, and many are illegal economic migrants. </tt><p>
<tt>Ethnic Vietnamese who left the Cambodian-Vietnamese border in 1993 cannot
return to Cambodia unless they have pre-1970 Cambodian papers.  Those with
post-1970 papers will be accepted on a case-by-case basis.  Those without any
legal identification papers will not be allowed to into Vietnam or Cambodia.
</tt><p>
<tt>The 3,705 ethnic Vietnamese who fled to Chrey Thom in 1993 are waiting
there to return to Cambodia.  The refugees traveled to the border under the
protection of the United Nations, after fleeing massacres of ethnic Vietnamese
by the Khmer Rouge.  Some 100 ethnic Vietnamese were reported to have been
killed by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in 1993. </tt><p>

Worker Rights in South Korea</a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>After a protest by Nepalese workers in Seoul last month, the South Korean
government announced reforms to protect the rights of foreign workers.  The
government will replace its foreign trainee program with a work permit system
that grants more rights to foreign workers.  The Nepalese workers claimed that
the trainee program was tantamount to slavery. </tt><p>
<tt>There are between 33,600 to 84,000 foreigners legally employed in  Korea,
and 19,000 to 32,000 of them are industrial trainees.</tt><p>
<tt>The new labor policy announced by the government promises easier entry for
foreign workers if small companies improve labor conditions. The government
next year will introduce a 'work permit' system, similar to ones used in
Singapore and Germany, to ensure a steady supply of imported labor.  Under the
work permit system, foreign workers will receive that same wages and legal
protections available to Korean workers. </tt><p>
<tt>There is some confusion in press reports about which program will be
terminated.  It is not clear if the work permit system will replace a recently
adopted training program for skilled workers, or only the unskilled "industrial
trainee" program that began in 1993.  </tt><p>
<tt>The Korean Federation of Small Businesses is offering 50,000 won (about
$63) for information on "runaway" foreign workers.  About 20 percent of the
industrial trainees admitted to Korea in the last half of 1994 left their
employers--who offer them less-than-minimum training wages--for higher wage
jobs elsewhere.</tt><p>
<tt>Beginning in March 1995, legal foreign workers will be eligible for workers
compensation coverage after paying a premium of $3.80 per month.  Under this
optional plan, employers will also pay $3.80 per month.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>Hong Kong officials worry that there will be a flood of Chinese immigrants
after the colony reverts to Chinese rule after 1997.  Although Hong Kong will
be a Special Administrative Region with its own immigration  laws, there is a
misconception among millions of Chinese that the gates will open for them.
</tt><p>
<tt>A delegation from Hong Kong was told in Beijing last December that a
massive publicity campaign would be launched six months before the change of
sovereignty to explain that the rules for traveling to Hong Kong will not
change.</tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong legislators are asking the government to review its immigration
policy on Chinese mainland spouses and the children of Hong Kong residents.
Current law permits the entry of children of Hong Kong residents, but not
necessarily their mothers.  There is concern that this ambiguity in the law
could lead to a large influx of unaccompanied illegal child immigrants.</tt><p>
<tt>The daily quota for mainlanders is 105 one-way entry permits.  Fifteen of
these are for the wives of Hong Kong men and another 15 are for mainland-born
children of permanent residents.  The remaining 70 are allocated by local
Chinese officials.  </tt><p>
<tt>Hong Kong officials estimate that of the 300,000 mainland-born children of
Hong Kong residents in China, about 64,000 legitimate children will be eligible
for permanent residency.  About 55,000 mainland-born children with residency
rights are projected to be in China in 1997. The number of children under 15
who came to settle in Hong Kong on one-way permits in 1992, 1993 and 1994 was
7,853, 8,396 and 11,156, respectively. </tt><p>
<tt>In Hong Kong, up to 10 maids had their contracts terminated every day at
the end of 1994, as families went on holiday, and chose not to take along or
pay their maids, according to the chairman of the Asian Domestic Workers'
Union.  Maids whose contracts are terminated have two weeks to find another job
before they are required to leave Hong Kong.</tt><p>

</a></h2>
<tt>China has a labor force of about 600 million, with 440 million peasants,
109 million in the state sector, 36 million in the collective sector, and 15
million in the private sector.  The official unemployment rate is 2.8 percent,
but the real unemployment rate may be 15 to 17 percent, or the highest in
decades.</tt><p>
<tt>Workers are moving from rural to urban areas in response to higher wages,
but once there, they are competing with redundant urban workers for jobs.
Annual average incomes for farmers are $106, $262 for rural factory workers,
and $419 for urban factory workers.  Many urban workers are "xia gang" or off
post, meaning that they remain attached to their work unit, but they receive
only a portion of their wages and do not report to work.</tt><p>
<tt>Competition between "xia gang" and rural-urban migrants has led to tension,
especially in southeastern provinces such as Guangdong near Hong Kong, where
there are at least 13 million rural migrants looking for jobs.  Chinese and
Hong Kong officials are especially concerned with the increase of illegal
immigration from the northern provinces of China.  These immigrants are blamed
for an increase in crime. </tt><p>
<tt>Most cities and provinces try to protect local residents.  In Shanghai, an
official asserted that the four million migrants in that city should do its
"dirty work."  Only about 500,000 of Shanghai's migrant workers are officially
registered, which allows migrants to work legally in factories. </tt><p>
<tt>Some predict that social tensions and emigration pressures will rise
because of China's one-child policy.  Chinese parents prefer boys to girls, and
in 1990, there were 114 boy babies born for each 100 girl babies, far higher
than the usual 105 boys to 100 girl ratio.  This means that there are likely to
be one million more 20 year old boys than girls in 2010 and, since emigration
streams are often led by solo males, some predict rising emigration
pressures.</tt><p>
<tt>Despite China's one-child policy, the population is growing by 1.1 percent
per year, and reached 1.2 billion in February 1995.  In 1994, there were about
21 million births and seven million deaths.  Food production is stable or
declining, as China, with 22 percent of the world's population, tries to feed
itself with seven percent or 235 million acres of the world's arable land.

</a></h2>
<tt>The January 17, 1995 Kobe earthquake that killed 5,300 people and left
300,000 homeless also prompted more than 350 illegal aliens to seek exit visas
to leave Japan at their own expense.  There are an estimated 293,000 illegal
aliens in Japan, and the government is simply repatriating, rather than
detaining or fining, those who lost their homes and jobs in the earthquake.
Illegal aliens are not entitled to housing or most other assistance that is
being made available to quake victims.</tt><p>
<tt>As Japan struggles to build replacement housing for those left homeless,
the government came under pressure to permit foreign carpenters to enter to
build the 2x4 wooden homes common in the western US, but rare in Japan.  These
homes withstood the quake far better than traditional Japanese homes, but Japan
is reluctant to permit US builders to bring to Japan the carpenters skilled in
2x4 construction.  Japan classifies carpenters as simple labor, and one
official asserted that, "Even in an emergency, we don't desire letting in
simple[foreign] laborers."</tt><p>
<tt>Some 2,365 illegal foreigners were deported from Japan following a major
crackdown in September, 1994.  More than 90 percent of those caught were
working illegally, usually in small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly
at construction sites and in metal goods manufacturing.  About one-fourth (509)
were Koreans, followed by 363 Thais and 292 Chinese.  In 1993 Japan repatriated
177,904 illegal  immigrants, up from 169,443 in the previous year.</tt><p>
<tt>The Kochi Prefectural Government announced that it would begin to accept
applications from and hire foreigners for certain city jobs, despite a 1953 law
that requires all public servants to be Japanese citizens.  About 1.3 million
foreigners were registered as residing in Japan in January 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>The Japanese deep-sea fishing labor management council has approved the use
of more foreign workers on fishing vessels because of a shortage of Japanese
workers.  The council will raise the current ceiling of 25 percent foreign
fisherman to 40 percent of the crew.  About 3,400 foreign fisherman worked on
the 1,700 Japanese deep-sea fishing boats in 1994.  About 70 percent of the
foreign fisherman were Indonesians, followed by Filipinos and Peruvians.  Wages
for foreign fisherman are about one-tenth of the wages of Japanese fishermen.

RM50,000 ($20,000) on employers for each illegal alien hired under a proposed
Recruitment of Foreign Workers Act.  There are, by some estimates, one million

<tt>The Malaysian government on January 7, 1994 imposed a ban on the
importation of unskilled foreign workers.  There were several calls in
February, 1995, for Malaysia to review its foreign worker policies.  The

permanent feature of the Malaysian labor market unless the government takes
action.  It recommends that a committee of union, employer, and government
officials review employer requests for foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The Association of  Foreign Workers  Agencies argues that foreign workers
must be legal and better regulated.  They complain that, even with the
government's one-stop offices, there is a three to four month lag between an
employer's application and the arrival of the foreign workers.  There are 168
employment agencies that bring foreign workers into Malaysia, and 101 are
members of the Association.  Each agency must post a RM 100,000 or $40,000 bond
with the immigration department.</tt><p>
<tt>The Malaysian Prime Minister told members of the private sector, that
instead of importing new recruits from overseas, they should hire workers who
have already entered the country illegally.  The presence of foreign workers is
taxing the country's infrastructure, he said, especially in housing, health and
education, said the prime minister.  Malaysia is calling for the private sector
to develop industries which are not labor intensive. </tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia issued 200,000 three-year work permits in 1992, and there are
fears that the government will not renew some of them in 1995.  Developers in
Johor Bahru worry the their construction projects will come to a halt if the
foreign workers permits are not renewed.  About 90,000 of the passes were given
to foreign workers in Johor.  The passes are not automatically renewed and
workers are required to return to their native land to renew the passes or they
can be renewed by the employer in Kuala Lumpur.</tt><p>
<tt>Malaysia announced that illegal foreigners who marry aboriginal Orang Asli
will be deported if apprehended.  Some 241  foreigners, mostly men, reportedly
married Orang Asli women.</tt><p>

Expelled from
Gabon</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a</a></a></h2>
<tt>Gabon, a West African country of 1.1 million with a 1992 per capita income
of $4,450, in September 1994 enacted laws that required foreigners to pay
residence fees or leave the country by February 15, 1995.  Gabon, a once rich
oil producer in recession, has between 75,000 to 100,000 foreign workers,
primarily from Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Mali, Cameroon, France and Senegal.
Since the September, 1994 announcement of the February 15, 1995 deadline,
55,000 foreign nationals left the country, and 15,000 legalized their
residency.</tt><p>
<tt>There was criticism of the Gabonese government because of the fees on
migrants wishing to remain in the country.  The fees varied by country of
origin, with critics contending that migrants from the richest countries were
being charged the least.  French citizens, for example, were required to pay
only about $100 for a new residence card, while immigrants from many of West
Africa's poorest countries were charged as much as $1,200.</tt><p>
<tt>Criticism of the Gabon government increased as the February 15 deadline
approached.  Many immigrants could not afford the air fare and used trucks and
ships to return home. The Beninese government authorized hiring a ship to
evacuate Beninese living illegally in Gabon prior to the February 15 deadline.
</tt><p>
<tt>About 1,000 people, mostly Nigerians, Ghanians and nationals of neighboring
Equatorial Guinea, have been detained by a special unit to hunt illegal
immigrants since February 15. Those detained are being held in a camp and will
be repatriated.  Hundreds of people were reported to have fled into the
rainforest around the oil town of Port-Gentil to escape the police.   </tt><p>
<tt>The twin-island nations of Sao Tome and Principe have set up an emergency
commission and requested help from the United Nations to assist with the influx
of returnees. There are over 20,000 Sao Tomeans in Gabon forming Sao Tome's
second largest emigrant community.  About 25,000 Sao Tomeans live in Angola and
a further 10,000 live in Portugal.</tt><p>
<tt>The Gabonese government warned that any violence against foreigners would
be dealt with severely.  In 1992, violence followed the expulsion of thousands
of illegal Nigerian workers.  During an anti- immigrant campaign in late 1993,
many West Africans were rounded up and jailed in poorly maintained prisons.
About 60 of them, mostly Nigerians and Ghanaians, died in custody.</tt><p>
<tt>The Ivory Coast, also a magnet for foreign workers, enacted laws recently
that barred foreigners from voting.  The Ivory Coast recently passed laws that
bar foreigners from voting and require that presidential candidates be of pure
Ivorian parentage.</tt><p>

<tt>Israel on February 5, 1995 rejected, but on February 16 accepted, PLO
demands that Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza be permitted to work in
Israel. .  However, Israeli Prime Minister Rabin continues to called for up to
25,000 foreign workers to be brought into Israel to eliminate the need for
Palestinian commuters. </tt><p>
<tt>The number of Palestinian workers in Israel peaked 110,000 in 1987, and
there were about 60,000 before the ban.  The mid-February agreement permits up
to 15,000 Palestinians daily to enter Israel, far less than the  number
entering in January.  Israel has been replacing Palestinians shut out of Israel
with Romanian and Thai guest workers. </tt><p>
<tt>A week after the Beit Lid bombing in early February, the Israeli cabinet
authorized the importation of 6,000 foreign workers.  Most of the workers post
a bond and surrender their passport to their employer to ensure that they will
remain on the job during the contract.</tt><p>
<tt>In early February, several hundred Romanian and Thai workers demonstrated
near a construction site in Hod Hasaron.  The workers were demanding two
months'  back pay from a construction company that went bankrupt, stopping all
work on the site.  The workers complained that the construction company still
had their passports.</tt><p>
<tt>Thais are employed primarily in agriculture and construction and remit
about $700 million to Thailand each year.  Non-Palestinian guestworkers
allegedly accept lower pay and longer hours than other foreign workers.</tt><p>
<tt>The average per capita GDP in Israel was $12,300 in 1993, versus $1500 in
the West Bank and Gaza and $1200 in Jordan.  Israel has a population of 5.4

</a></h2>
<tt>Black South Africans have recently begun to march to protest that illegal
immigrants are stealing jobs--they reportedly will work for $15 per week or
less--and for committing crimes and hawking goods in competition with
established businesses.  The major countries of origin are Mozambique, where
the government is barely functioning; Angola, ravaged by civil war; Malawi,
emerging from a decades-long dictatorship; and Zimbabwe, where a restructuring
of the economy has left many workers jobless.</tt><p>
<tt>The South African government would like promote economic development in the
countries of origin so that if does not have to deport aliens back to countries
that sheltered the ANC.  Migrant worker movements were halted in January 1995
in an effort to curb violence in South Africa.</tt><p>
<tt>Xenophobia is growing in South African townships that are housing migrants.
There are an estimated two to 8 million illegal aliens in South Africa, with
most experts agreeing that the two million figure is most realistic.  In
January, 1995, the Concerned Alexandra Residents' Association was created, and
it has led thousands of people on marches calling for illegal aliens to go
home.</tt><p>
<tt>The African nation of Malawi is carefully screening foreign workers to
ensure that they have work permits and do not replace native workers.  The
newly democratic government claims that the previous government gave work
permits to all foreign whites, even though qualified local workers were
available. Companies investing in Malawi often want to bring in foreign
managers. </tt><p>
<tt>The Malawi government also announced on February 14 that it has given
80,000 Mozambican refugees notice that they must return home by May or face a
cut-off in food and transportation.  More than one million Mozambicans have
already been repatriated.  The southern districts of Malawi is home to
Mozambican refugees fleeing a 16-year civil war.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC32">Benefits
and Costs of Immigrants</a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a></a> 
</a></h2>
<tt>The Rand Corporation held a one-day workshop on January 26, 1995 to review
studies of the taxes paid and the costs of benefits provided to
immigrants--legal and illegal.  Two background points were emphasized.  First,
all studies are forced to use snapshots to try to construct a motion picture
account of immigrants' lives.  Second, there are a number of legitimate
conceptual issues that are obscured rather than highlighted in many
studies.</tt><p>
<tt>For example, a snapshot study of the taxes paid by, and the tax-paid
services received by, high school or college students would show that most cost
more than they pay.  Yet such findings cause little concern, because we assume
that those who complete school will eventually earn more and pay higher taxes.
</tt><p>
<tt>There are dozens of conceptual issues.  These include what costs to use.
For example, should one include only costs attributable to illegal aliens, or
also costs attributable to their US citizen children who would not be here if
their parents were not?  Should the costs attributed to immigrants, legal or
illegal, be the generally minimal marginal costs of providing park or
transportation services to one more person, or the typically higher average
cost calculated by taking the total cost of education or health care and
dividing by the number of residents?</tt><p>
<tt>Most studies of the taxes paid by and the costs of providing services to
illegal aliens use as a benchmark a 1992 Los Angeles county study.  Los Angeles
county has about nine million residents, including an estimated one million
unauthorized aliens, or one-fourth of the unauthorized aliens in the US.
Immigrants at the extremes of the education distribution--with college degrees
and without high-school diplomas--continued to move into Los Angeles despite a
severe recession that encouraged high-school educated US citizens to leave.
</tt><p>
<tt>Los Angeles began to lose jobs in 1989.  Nonfarm wage and salary employment
in Los Angeles county fell by 500,000, from  a peak 4.2 million in October 1989
to a 3.7 million in October 1994.  All studies agree that the taxes paid by
generally youngish and lower-than-average-earning immigrants go primarily to
the federal government, while the costs of public services used by immigrants
and their families are provided mainly by state and local governments.
Furthermore, most studies conclude that illegal immigrants do not generate as
much in revenues to cover the costs of the public services they consume.
</tt><p>
<tt>The result was a budget squeeze, and a reaction against especially illegal
immigration as exemplified by Prop 187 in November 1994.</tt><p>
<tt>Rand reviewed the taxes paid and costs of services provided and concluded
that the national studies were not comparable because all included different
amounts of costs and revenues.  According to Rand estimates, the amount of
revenues included ranged from 45 to 75 percent of actual revenues collected
directly and indirectly from immigrants, and the percentage of costs included
ranged from 40 to 80 percent.  Thus, one reason why there is disagreement on
whether all immigrants, or subgroups of immigrants, "pay their way" is that
different studies include different percentages of the universe of possible
costs and revenues.</tt><p>
<tt>All studies agree that US-born citizens have more favorable revenue-cost
ratios than recent immigrants, and that legal immigrants have more favorable
revenue-cost ratios than illegal immigrants.  These differences are due
primarily to assumptions about earnings and taxes paid.  </tt><p>
<tt>According to Rand, lack of adequate data on actual service usage and tax
payments by immigrants have led the studies to make potentially erroneous
assumptions.  For instance, many of the studies assume that illegal immigrants
have a high incidence of payroll deductions and tax payments.  But RAND found
that less than 40 percent of a sample of illegal Salvadorans in Los Angeles had
payroll taxes deducted from their average $10,000 incomes in the early
1990s.</tt><p>

<a name="RTFToC33">Characteristics
of US Farm Workers</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
<tt>Gabbard, Susan, Richard Mines, and Beatiz Boccalandro.  1994.  Migrant
Farmworkers:  Pursuing Security in an Unstable Labor Market.  Washington DC:
US Department of Labor , ASP Research Report 5, May.</tt><p>
<tt>This report is based on interviews with workers employed on US crop farms
in the early 1990s.  Migrant farmworkers are defined as those who moved at
least 75 miles from their usual residences to do farmwork, and 42 percent of
the sample workers were migrants under this definition.  </tt><p>
<tt>There is no firm estimate of the number of US farmworkers, and there is no
uniform definition of migrant farm worker.  <b>If</b> there are 2.5 million US
farmworkers, and <b>if</b> the sample covered 1.6 million workers employed on
crop farms, then there would be 670,000 migrant farmworkers on crop farms.
Note that if 10 percent of the remaining 900,000 workers were migrants, the
overall migrant percentage would be 30 percent of the US hired farm workforce
(90 + 670/2500=30).</tt><p>
<tt>Most migrant farmworkers are immigrants--85 percent--and another 10 percent
are US-born Hispanics.  Their mean age was 30, they had an average seven years
US farm work experience, they had an average 6.5 years of schooling, and they
averaged fewer than three US farm employers per year.  Migrants averaged 25
weeks of farm work annually, and earned about $5.60 hourly.</tt><p>
<tt>Two major types of migrants are distinguishable in the data:  follow the
crop migrants who move from one US farm to another, and shuttle migrants who
move back and forth between Mexican homes and US farm jobs.  A few migrants
shuttle into the US and then follow the crops.  About one in three migrant
workers follows the crops, five in six shuttle back and forth, and one in six
do both.</tt><p>
<tt>Follow the crop migrants were the predominant type of migrants in the
1960s, and the notion that migrant workers follow the sun from south to north
is the image that still comes to mind when migrants are discussed today.
However, only 13 percent of crop workers--an estimated 210,000--and less than
10 percent of all farmworkers--had at least two US farm jobs at least 75 miles
apart within in one year.  </tt><p>
<tt>There has been a major change in the "base state" or usual residence of
migrant farmworkers--Mexico has replaced Florida, Texas, and California.  Most
migrant farmworkers shuttle back and forth between homes in Mexico and jobs in
the US, i.e., they maintain homes at least 75 miles from the place where they
do farm work for wages.  Most of these shuttle migrants--83 percent--have homes
in Mexico, and commute to US farm jobs.  One in six migrants live in one US
location, such as South Texas, and commute to another US location to do farm
work, such as California or Michigan.  </tt><p>
<tt>Migrants prefer to settle in one location.  By arraying workers by their
years of US farm work experience, it appears that men with less than six years
of US farm work experience shuttle or back and forth without their families,
and sometimes follow the crops within the US, but later they shuttle into the
US for farm jobs in one area, and then settle in the US.  </tt><p>
<tt>Since migration, especially follow the crop migration, is associated with
younger immigrant workers who travel without their families, these data call
into question some of the premises upon which the $600 million in federal farm
worker assistance programs are based.  These programs assume that there are
significant numbers of migrant farm worker families who follow the crops, and
that their children will be unable to escape the migrant stream without
assistance.  The NAWS  data, however, indicate that, when migrant workers gain
experience, they "naturally" tend to settle in one area.

RFPs Invited</a>
</a></h2>
<tt>The Demographic and Behavioral Sciences Branch (DBSB), Center for
Population Research, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) invites qualified researchers to submit applications for research on
immigration to the United States.  For the purposes of this PA, an immigrant
refers to a foreign-born person who enters the United States without U.S.
citizenship.  The large number of immigrants in the past two decades may have
already had a major impact on the social and economic structure of the United
States.  </tt><p>
<tt>American immigration policies have been shaped by a duality of economic and
humanitarian concerns.  Humanitarian concerns are reflected in the preferential
treatment of refugees as well as the importance of </tt><p>
<tt>family reunification as a selection criterion for immigrant status.
Especially in recent times, public policy and scientific debates about
immigration have focused on the estimation methods used to count the numbers of
immigrants and emigrants, and the effectiveness of public policies in dealing
with the impact of immigrants, particularly their contributions and costs to
society.</tt><p>
<tt>The purpose of this Program Announcement is to encourage: 1) development of
methodological research tools for measurement and analysis of immigration and
emigration; 2) descriptive and analytical study of immigrant populations,
particularly immigrant children and families; 3) maximum use of existing data
on immigrants or the foreign born for analyses, and the linking of such data to
administrative records on, for example, program and welfare use to obtain a
more accurate profile of immigrant experiences; and 4) the collection of new
longitudinal and panel data to examine issues such as the health, socioeconomic
status, and resilience of immigrants, as well as intergenerational transmission
of skills and resources.</tt><p>
<tt>For further information contact:  Inquiries are encouraged.  The
opportunity to clarify any issues or questions from potential applicants is
welcome.  Direct inquiries regarding programmatic issues to:</tt><p>
