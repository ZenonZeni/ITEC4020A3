Jenner Technologies Inc., named after small pox vaccine pioneer Edward Jenner, is trying to emulate his success in solid tumors. And the company is trying to do so without spending hundreds of millions of dollars. <p>
In its three years of existence, Jenner has spent only $1.7 million of $2.3 million raised, while reaching the clinic with two therapeutic cancer vaccines based on whole tumor antigen. Each vaccine cost about $700,000, and Jenner is spending only $100,000 a year on overhead. <p>
The first vaccine, OncoVax P for prostate cancer, began a Phase I/II trial in October, and a second, OncoVax CL for colorectal and lung (small cell and non-small cell) cancers, is expected to begin Phase I/II testing in1996. <p>
The company was founded in 1992 by Lynn Spitler, formerly with Xoma Corp., where she oversaw the development and first clinical trial of an anti-melanoma immunotoxin. Spitler believed that to be effective, therapeutic tumor vaccines, or immunotherapies, must be efficiently recognized by the immune system. In addition, such vaccines must be able to target metastatic as well as visible disease. <p>
Spitler's experience with monoclonal antibodies led her to conclude that tumor antigens, not antibodies, were the key to creating a strong immune response. Because humans have many HLA (human leukocyte antigen) types, Spitler theorized that presenting the patient's immune system with whole antigens rather than single epitopes would allow an individual's immune system to select its own proper epitope to which to respond.<p>
<b><center>Delivery vehicles</b></center><p>
As delivery vehicles, Spitler chose liposomes, which are naturally taken up by the reticuloendothelium. That system rids the body of toxins and as such is a direct channel to the immune system's key cells and sites. As it turns out, liposomal formulation of a vaccine enhances the production of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. <p>
Adding an adjuvant capable of inducing a CTL response should enhance efficacy as well. Ultimately, combining more than one antigen into a vaccine "cocktail" may improve its performance, said CEO Anthony Maida III.<p>
Spitler and Maida are co-holders of a patent application for Jenner's prostate cancer vaccine, based on recombinant prostate-specific antigen (PSA). PSA is found on normal and cancerous prostate tissue, but nowhere else in the body, making it an ideal target. <p>
Jenner exclusively licensed its second antigen, KSA, from Eli Lilly and Co. In addition to being present in colorectal and lung tumors, KSA is found on pancreatic and ovarian tumors, which the company may choose to target in the future.<p>
Maida and Spitler believe their targets and their technology are superior to other immunotherapies. For example, use of peptides as antigens represent only one epitope of an antigen, while the use of anti-idiotypic antibodies as antigens represents a single B cell epitope unlikely to elicit a CTL response. According to Jenner, antigens cause the body to mount a broader immune response than antibodies, including production of CTLs.<p>
<b><center>'Off the shelf'</b><center><p>
The company also believes that gene therapies probably will be expensive compared to Jenner's "off the shelf" products. <p>
Jenner has kept its burn rate low by spending money on science rather than infrastructure. In the company's virtual, or "leveraged resource management" model, as much as risk possible is contracted out. Crucial research has been done under a CRADA with Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which formulated the PSA antigen. <p>
A second institution is responsible for cloning and expressing of antigen, while Northview Labs in Emeryville, Calif., does the toxicology, and purification is done in Rockville, Md.<p>
Maida believes that out-sourcing gives him more, rather than less, control over the execution of Jenner's science than the in-house alternative. And it saves money by taking advantage of existing facilities and personnel. "I can afford the best -- I have access to $20-$50 million of facilities with this approach," he said.<p>
Jenner has recently begun raising a planned $5 million round of financing. A first round of $1.7 million was raised through a private placement in May 1993; a $600,000 round completed last March.<p>
