	 NEW YORK (Reuter) - International Business Machines Corp. <br>
unveiled a new service Tuesday to secure publishers' rights on <br>
the Internet, joining a flurry of small companies who are also <br>
trying to become toll takers on the global computer network.  <br>
	 IBM signed up 29 information and technology providers for <br>
the service, called the IBM infoMarket, including the Associated <br>
Press, States News Service, and ESPN Sports Ticker.  <br>
	 At the same time, a small, privately-held company, <br>
Electronic Publishing Resources Inc., based in Sunnyvale, <br>
Calif., also unveiled an electronic rights system, called <br>
NetTrust, to protect the rights of content creators, developers <br>
and distributors.  <br>
	 Both companies unveiled their products at the Internet World <br>
conference in Boston on Tuesday.  <br>
	 Publishers are worried that Internet users will be able to <br>
access their material, download it, print it out and then <br>
distribute it without paying any fees to the owners of the <br>
copyrighted material.  <br>
	 ``Rights management and security have been two inhibitors to <br>
electronic commerce,'' said Sam Albert, a Scarsdale, N.Y.-based <br>
consultant. He said that IBM's clout and commitment to the <br>
Internet could induce other publishers to join IBM.  <br>
	 Both IBM's service and the NetTrust system work by putting <br>
material, such as articles or other copyrighted information, in <br>
a sealed ``container'' at a World Wide Web site, a portion of <br>
the Internet. Users could browse but not access the material in <br>
its entirety without paying a fee.  <br>
	 On IBM's system, a user receives a private, electronic key, <br>
to unlock the package in its sealed container and then it can be <br>
be downloaded, printed or read. On Electronic Publishing's <br>
NetTrust, a user accesses a ``DigiBox'' protecting the content.  <br>
	 Once the material is accessed by the user, they will have to <br>
pay a fee that is then passed on to the publisher.  <br>
	 An IBM spokesman said the company has not yet announced any <br>
pricing structure for its service, which is expected to be <br>
available in the first quarter of 1996.  <br>
	 ``I'm not sure how the market is playing out,'' said Jerry <br>
Michalski, an editor at the Release 1.0 newsletter. ``There is a <br>
gaping hole in the marketplace to comply with copyright law. <br>
There is a clear, clear need for someone to do this right.''  <br>
	 IBM, Electronic Publishing, another small company called <br>
Wave Systems Corp. in New York and others are all hoping to cash <br>
in on protecting the rights of publishers of the growing volumes <br>
of information published on the Internet, now available for <br>
free.  <br>
	 As part of its announcement, IBM also unveiled a technology <br>
called Cryptolopes, which will enable owners of copyrighted <br>
information to securely distribute it and receive payment for <br>
its use over the Internet.  <br>
	 IBM also set up a clearinghouse to assist the content <br>
providers in managing content access and payment processing.  <br>
	 Other content providers include I/B/E/S International Inc., <br>
which tracks financial data and Wall Street analysts' estimates <br>
of company earnings, and legal publishers West Publishing Inc.  <br>
