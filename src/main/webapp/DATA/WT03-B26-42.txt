A round-up of other national and international news 
<H3>Spaceworks 96</H3>
From 25&shyp;29 March, Canberra hosted Spaceworks 96, a large and well-attended
event combining: the 4th Australian Space Development Conference; the 8th
Australian Remote Sensing Conference and Workshops; and the 10th Space Engineering
Symposium, and Workshops. SpIN's next issue will include reports on conferences
and international visitors, plus workshop descriptions.<BR>
Student space science club<BR>
<BR>
If your kids are excited about space, consider Galactic Circle, an Australian
children's space science club. Galactic Circle inspires students about space
science, illustrating the benefits of space technology. With support from
professional science organisations, members can participate in space camps,
excursions, lectures and more. Members receive Galactic Gazette, the club
newsletter, and other material. Galactic Circle can also assist teachers
with educational resources and materials for school chapters. Membership
costs $20. <BR>

<H3>&quot;Looking Around&quot; CD available</H3>
The CD &quot;Looking Around&quot;, an electronic version of Biodiversity
Series, Paper No. 7, &quot;Landcover Disturbance Over the Australian Continent:
A contemporary assessment&quot;, is now available from COSSA. <BR>
<BR>
The CD extends the printed report, which uses satellite images from 1990&shyp;92
to document Australian landcover change and examine its effect on biodiversity.
The CD text is more comprehensive, though written for non-scientists in
an accessible and personal style. The CD images are also more numerous,
and clicking them reveals larger versions.<BR>
<BR>
In an uncommon move for scientific publications, the CD contains all data
underlying the conclusions, to encourage comparison and evaluation. And
as with many electronic documents, the text is cross-referenced with hypertext
links, and pages can be turned using the forward/back buttons, just like
a book.<BR>

<H3>Electronic maps aid Bosnian peace</H3>
Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian delegates to the recent peace conference
in Dayton, Ohio, were able to negotiate border changes quickly, thanks to
the Imagine software from ERDAS.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine, a sophisticated Geographic Information System, allowed delegates
to visualise how proposed border changes would affect roads, towns, and
use of natural resources. <BR>
<BR>
Delegates drew boundaries on acetate maps, and technicians from the US Defence
Mapping Agency applied the changes to maps already loaded in the US Army
Multispectral Imagery Production System (MSIP). MSIP is a terrain visualisation
tool, using ERDAS Imagine for image analysis and map updating.<BR>
<BR>
Changing the borders took minutes, requiring only drawing lines on a screen,
then printing the new maps. Maps were printed using the DMA's Remote Replication
System (RRS), a mapping package also based on Imagine. <BR>
<BR>
During the three-week negotiations, the Imagine systems created, revised
and printed over 3000 maps. The final Bosnian peace agreement included over
100 computer-produced maps, initialled and officially sealed by the Presidents
of the three countries.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine technology, having aided in negotiating the agreement, is also helping
in its maintenance. US pilots and troops rehearse and plan for missions
long before they arrive in the region.<BR>
Early in the NATO operation, few maps were available for even the simplest
navigations. But within days, field troops could make their own maps using
MSIP computers equipped with Imagine. <BR>

<H3>Global Positioning Systems Summit</H3>
The Global Positioning Systems Asia '96 Summit and Exhibition will be held
in Singapore's Marina Mandarin Hotel, 18&shyp;21 June 1996.<BR>
<BR>
The conference organisers have brought together a senior panel of experts
from leading GPS organisations, to illustrate regional uses of Global Positioning
Systems. The conference consists of two tracks, offering attendees information
more focused to their needs: Land and Vehicular Applications, and Civil
and Aviation Applications.<BR>
<BR>
An exhibition of the latest GPS products will run throughout the event,
and the following workshops will be available: Fundamentals of GPS; and
Differential GPS Engineering &amp; Design, for advanced users.<BR>
