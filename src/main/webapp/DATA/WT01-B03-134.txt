<p><img src="../images/Mar_961.gif" alt="Platinum vs Gold Ratio"
width="640" height="437"> </p>

<p>Last month we discussed the ratio of Gold vs. Bonds. As we
saw, the ratio is often a better indicator of the true value of a
commodity than its price in dollars.Last month we discussed the
ratio of Gold versus Bonds As we saw the ratio is often a better
indicator of the true value of a commodity than its price in
dollars. This month I woulde like towill take a look at the ratio
of Gold to Platinum. Since 1990 the ratio has stayed in a
elativelynarrow range&#151; primarily between .95 and 1.15. As we
can see from the following chart there have been two instances
(circled) in the last five years where Platinum has actually sold
for less than Gold. . On January 1, 1992, Platinum reached a low
of 95.7% of the price of Gold and on July 1, 1993, the ratio
reached a low of 98%.On January 1 1992 Platinum reached a low of
95.7% of the price of Gold and on July 1,1993 the ratio reached a
low of 98%. </p>

<p>In the first instance, it tookin less than nine months for the
ratio to reached above 110% (point &#147;A&#148;) and in the
second it only took one month! (point &#147;B&#148;) There are
several ways to profit from this ratio. The first assumes that
you will always be holding either Gold or Platinum. This is an
excellent strategy for multiplying our emergency Gold holdings. </p>

<p>As I have said many times, we should be holding a portion of
our total assets in precious metals as a hedge against crisis.
These include those created by governments such as war,
inflation, and bond defaults. It also includes those created by
terrorists, oil companies, etc. </p>

<p>Our first method of profiting is to watch the ratio and to
switching a portion of our assets from Gold to Platinum whenever
the ratio crosses below 105%. Should the ratio go below 100% we
would add to our Platinum position. We would then switch back
into Gold whenever the ratio crossed above 110%. Should the ratio
go below 100% we would add to our platinum position. A good
guideline would be to switch half50% of our gGold to pPlatinum
below 105% and the other half50% below 100%. If the ratio moves
significantly above 110% we could use options to increase our
profit (seesee method #2). </p>

<p>Let's suppose we followed this strategy in January of 1992
with Gold at $353, Platinum at $338 and the ratio at 95.7%.Let's
suppose we had followed this strategy in January of 1992 with
Gold at 353, Platinum at 338 and the ratio at 95.7%. We could
have sold 10 ounces of Gold for $3530. With that we could
purchase 10.44 ounces of Platinum. On August 1, just eight months
later, the price of gGold had fallen to $342 but Platinum had
risen to $384.50. At this point our 10.44 ounces is worth
$4014.18 and we can exchange it for 11.74 ounces of gGold. In
dollar terms we would have made 13.7%. As I have said before,
even if Platinum had fallen in price it is the ratio that
countsbecause since we increased the ounces of Gold we held.
Incidentally, in this instance we would have increased our Gold
holdings by 17.4% instead of &#147;just&#148; 13.7%. </p>

<p>If we followed this strategy in July, 1993, we could have sold
our 10 ounces of Gold for $3920. and bought 10.18 ounces of
Platinum. oOne month later Gold had fallen to $375 and Platinum
had risen to $416. iIf we cashed in at that point we would have
received $4235 which we could have exchanged for 11.29 ounces of
Gold. wWith perfect hindsight we can see that at that point we
should have sold the Platinum for cash and held it a month and
bought gGold at $355! However, foresight is never quite as good
as hindsight. If we ignore the one month exchange and wait until
the two month point, we have a good example of why we need to
watch the ratio and not the price.However, had we missed the one
month exchange and waited until the two month point we have a
good example of why we need to watch the ratio and not the price.
At this point Gold is selling for $355 and pPlatinum is $360. so
Thethe ratio is still 107% and falling so we should still switch
to gGold at this point. oOur 10.18 ounces of Platinum is worth
$3664.80 or 10.32 ounces of Gold. sSo even though the Platinum we
were holding fell in price, we still increased our holdings! </p>

<p>By December the ratio was once again at 95.8%&#151; with Gold
at $382 and Platinum at $366 &#151;so we could exchange our 10.32
ounces of Gold for 10.77 oz.unces of Platinum. tThis we would
have held for a year and a half until May, 1995, when the ratio
was 114% with Gold up a mere $7 and Platinum at $446. aAtt this
point our 10.77 ounces of Platinum was worth 12.35 ounces of
Gold! </p>

<p>In this way rather than our Gold &#147;insurance policy&#148;
resulting in a loss of interest it is earning us interest. </p>

<p>The second method of using the ratio is using futures or
options. WheneverWhen ever the ratio is trending down you would
be long Gold and short Platinum. This can be done several ways, <i>e.g.,</i>
by buying a Gold Call or contract and selling a Platinum Call or
Contract or by buying a Gold Call and Buying a Platinum Put.This
can be done several ways i.e. by buying a Gold Call or contract
and sell a Platinum call or contract or by buying a Gold Call and
Buying a Platinum Put. These are called covered Contracts or
Spreads. They involve a lot less risk than &#147;Naked&#148;
Contracts and require a much smaller outlay (or margin). The
reason for the minimized risk (and cost) is that they tend to
travel in the same direction so your losses on one are covered by
the gains on the other. In our case where our Platinum fell in
price our gGold Contract would have increased in value. </p>

<p>The final use for the Platinum Gold Ratio is in deciding what
to buy. If we are buying additional metals for our insurance
position or if we are buying metals stock in our MIP strategy we
can use the ratio to decide which is preferable.If we are
planning on buying additional metals for our insurance position
or if we are buying metals stock in our MIP strategy we can use
the ratio to decide which is preferable. If the ratio is rising
we would buy Platinum or Platinum Stocks and if it is falling we
would buy Gold or Gold Stocks. </p>

<p>As of March 22, 1996, the ratio had just crossed below 105%
and looked as iflike it might be turning up. So if we follow the
plan outlined in our first method we should be switching a
portion (perhaps half) of our holdings into Platinum. </p>

<p>Should the ratio resume it's downward motion below 100% we
would switch the remainder of our Gold into Platinum. When the
ratio moves above 110% we should switch back to Gold. I will be
adding this ratio chart to our regular features. </p>

<p><b><i>Caution</i></b>: A key factor in profiting from this
ratio is to not pay too high a premium to the dealer. You should
always compare prices and shop dealers. Often one will have a
surplus while the other has a shortage. This can result in price
differences of as much as 10% (either doubling or eliminating
your profit). </p>

<p>Silver and Gold Report (SGR), P.O. Box 109665, Palm Beach, FL
33410, regularly publishes a listing of price comparisons of
various dealers. In addition they warn of unscrupulous practices
and vendors. Their newsletter is highly recommended. </p>

Predictor (MIP)</a></h2>

<p><img src="../images/Mar_962.gif" alt="March, 1996:MIP"
width="640" height="437"> </p>

<p>Our Moore Inflation Predictor looks very much different from
last month for several reasons. The first reason is that during
the month of March the Bureau of Labor Statistics released two
sets of Consumer Price Data.The first reason is that during the
month of march two sets of Consumer Price Data were released. The
January data was released in early -in March rather than
mid-February due to the second government shutdown. Then tTwo
weeks later they released the February data was released. sSo
this chart actually combines changes that normally would be
spread over two charts. But even that does not completely explain
the major differences that exist between the two charts. </p>

<p>During normal periods we could skip a month and never notice
it, because the chart is so accurate over a 6 month time frame.
During this period, however, the December index showed a
deflation while January showed double growth. </p>

<p>This is what may have happened: Due toBecause of the
government shutdown some pencil pushers at the Bureau of Labor
statistics got behind in their work so they fudged some of the
numbers. This resulted in a false deflation in the December
numbers. When the actual index was calculated for the month of
January, it revealed that the index had not fallen at all, but
now was two months higher than at the end of November (see index
numbers on last page).When the actual index was calculated for
the month of January it revealed that the index had not fallen at
all but now was two months higher than at the end of November. </p>

<p>This is similar to what happens occasionally when our electric
meters are read only every other month. During the estimated
month our bill may appear extremely high or low but the following
month when the company reads the actual numbers our bill is once
again correct.During the estimated month our bill may appear
extremely high or low but the following month when the actual
numbers are read our bill is corrected. </p>

<p>In the case of the CPI, though, the market participants are so
short-sighted, they forget that the previous month was down. They
seem to think that since the monthly inflation is reading twice
as high as before that inflation has risen dramatically.In the
case of the CPI though- The market participants are so short
sighted, they forget that last month was down and think that
since the monthly inflation is reading twice as high as last
month that inflation has risen dramatically. Consequently, the
market has bid up Gold and trashed bBonds. </p>

<p>I believe that the market was a bit premature in signaling the
death of bBonds. Unfortunately, this unique twist of the numbers
combined with the uncertainty surrounding the budget process has
really done a number on Bondsbonds. The CPI has registered a
single down month so far and we are expecting at least two more
which ought to pull Bondsbonds out of their slump. After that the
current MIP chart is projecting a fairly steep rise. If the rise
in the CPI materializes as depicted by the median line (which is
usually the most likely) we would see a very steep rise in Gold
prices later this year. </p>

<p><img src="../images/Mar_963.gif" alt="Gold vs Bonds Ratio"
width="640" height="340"> </p>

<p>Normally, I put a great deal of faith in the MIP's
projections., hHowever, due to the skewing of the recent numbers
I am not so sure that the rise will be as steep as currently
projected. However, even if the actual CPI only follows the
bottom line we are still in for a fairly steep rise in Gold
prices due to the October- January climb. When we allow for the
usual lag this ought to result in a steep climb in Gold prices
beginning November- December and ending around next March. </p>

<p>As it appears right now the window of opportunity for Bonds
should be ending around June or July. Hopefully cCongress and the
President will get their act together before then. From that
point on we may stick with Gold for the remainder of the year or
try to play the decline from August through October.From there on
we may stick with Gold for the remainder of the year or try to
play the decline from August through October. But we will
definitely need to wait for more data before making any firm
commitments. </p>

name="The Budget and Government">The Budget and Government</a></h2>

<p>As of this writing the congress is proposing a one week
extension of the temporary funding. Which would extend it until
March 29th. It appears that the extensions are getting shorter
and Clinton has threatened not to accept any more short term
extensions. I really don't see how he has much choice. What can
he say? Close down the Government again, I'm not taking the money
you're giving me. I think he may have realized what I have been
saying all along. The temporary extensions are really the same as
a budget cut since they use lower numbers than would probably
appear in a &#147;real&#148; budget. So as far as the Republicans
are concerned no budget is as good as the budget cuts they are
after. They just budget the money one month at a time and they
have strict control over what they fund and what they don't! </p>

<p>Interestingly enough, now they are talking about giving up
some of that control to the President. The Presidential line item
veto which has languished in both the Senate and House for months
suddenly found new life when Dole essentially clinched the
Republican nomination. The reason of course is that now Dole
wants it, previously the Republicans did not want to give it to
Clinton and the Democrats fought it for years. It appears that it
actually stands a chance of passing and Clinton wants it, so it
will not be Vetoed. I think it is a good thing, it does not let
the President change matters of policy but it does let him reduce
or eliminate (but not raise) funding for individual programs. It
could go a long way toward reducing the budget deficit and pork
barrel projects. It could face Constitutional challenges but 43
of the 50 states have similar provisions for their Governor and
these have withstood the challenge. Incidentally the Republicans
may attach it to their budget proposal as a carrot to get the
President to agree! </p>

<p>As we can see from the current Ratio Chart the ratio has
leveled off, i.e., points &#147;A&#148; and &#147;B&#148; are
virtually equal. At this point this looks like a topping
formation. My only concern on a technical basis is the fact that
point &#147;B&#148; was higher than point &#147;A&#148;, even
though it was very marginal. The pattern would be much clearer if
it was marginally lower rather than higher. </p>

<p>Point &#147;C&#148; actually crossed below the moving average
giving us a buy signal which only lasted two days as it crossed
back above the average. This is a classical &#147;whip-saw&#148;
as discussed last month. Point &#147;D&#148; came to rest on the
average but bounced back above. </p>

<p>Due to the importance to the overall market and all our

upon the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the overall New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index. We choose the NYSE because it is
a broad based index giving us a much better indication of the
overall market than an index like the Dow. </p>

<p>Even though the index itself has stayed in the same range for
the last month it is developing a very weak pattern. The three
peaks over the last month appear almost level but they are
actually volatile lower highs. The first was at 351.70 (the all

the relative strength drops drastically. </p>

<h3>Reading The MIP Chart</h3>

<p>The Moore Inflation Predictor (MIP) Chart is a predictor of
the inflation rate for the coming 12 months. It is extremely
accurate over a six month time frame and accurately forecasts
turning points out to the 1 year mark. </p>

<p>The vertical axis is the inflation rate in percent while the
horizontal axis is the date. </p>

<p>The left side of the chart is the actual historical Consumer
Price Index (CPI-U). While the right side is the predicted CPI-U. </p>

<p>The right side consists of several diverging lines starting at
a &quot;You are here&quot; arrow. The median line is the most
likely prediction for the future CPI-U with likely highs and lows
diverging from it and extreme highs and lows further out. </p>

<p><b>By focusing on the median line you can easily see future
turning points in the CPI-U index.</b> </p>

<p>An increase in this index usually translates into an increase
in the price of Gold, Gold stocks and other precious metals and
commodities. </p>

<p>A decrease in the CPI-U index usually indicates a decrease in
inflation hedges and an increase in Bonds, Utilities and other
interest sensitive instruments. </p>

<p><b>CPI UP = GOLD UP </b></p>

<p><b>CPI DOWN. = BONDS UP</b> </p>

<h3>CPI Data-</h3>

<p>By annualizing the CPI-U Data from various time spans we can
get an idea of the likely range over the next year's time frame.
Keep in mind that 1 and 2 month rates have very little long-term
significance. </p>

<h3>The Basic Portfolio- </h3>

<p>For the simplest portfolio stay with the Benham Family. We
have chosen Benham for three reasons. </p>

<ol>
    <li>It has a good Gold Fund. </li>
    <li>It has a long term Bond Fund that is usually the most
        volatile (i.e. provides the greatest upside potential
        during up moves) </li>
    <li>It has several alternatives for parking funds during
        periods of uncertainty. </li>
</ol>

<p>Use Benham 2020 when we recommend a Bond Fund and Benham Gold
Equity Index Fund for periods when Gold Funds are recommended. </p>

<h3>New Money</h3>

<p>Any funds recently freed up should follow the &quot;New
Money&quot; indicator. </p>

<h3>Volatility</h3>

<p>Our greatest ally and biggest foe is volatility. We rely upon
large changes in the prices of our funds during relatively short
periods of time. This can result in short term losses if we
switch directions too early. This is referred to as &quot;draw
down&quot; i.e. in the long run we made money but in the mean
time, our account showed a temporary paper loss. Some investors
have difficulty handling large draw downs. They should follow the
conservative approach. </p>

<h3>Diversification</h3>

<p>All investors should diversify by investing a portion of their
portfolio using several other investment approaches including-
well selected individual securities, mutual funds and other
appropriate investments. Our goal is to maximize overall
portfolio performance with a minimum of risk. </p>

<h3>Insurance Gold</h3>

<p>Every investor should have a portion (usually 10-15% or 1yrs
living expenses) of their assets in physical Gold and/or Silver
(coins and/or bullion). This should be considered insurance
against market chaos and is not an investment. The cost of this
insurance is the missed interest. </p>

<h3>Relative Strength</h3>

<p>Relative Strength Indices (RSI) provide advance warning of
prices that are either very overbought (too high) or very
oversold (too low). Certain patterns also indicate a coming
increase or decrease in prices. Relative Strength is very
sensitive and often provides very early signals (sometimes too
early). </p>
