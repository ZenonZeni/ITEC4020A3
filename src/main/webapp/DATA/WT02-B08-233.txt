<H1>Summary of the Peri-Antarctic Islands</H1>

</CENTER>
<hr>




Compiled by R.K. Headland<p>

These are the 19 islands and archipelagos around Antarctica.  
The peri-Antarctic islands  include  the  sub-Antarctic  ones and several 
others with associated features.  The positions given are approximately the 
middle point for smaller islands and their limits for larger ones and groups.  
The other figures are from the best sources available:  not all are equally
reliable.<p>

Names are given in the forms recommended  by  the  Union G&eacuteographique 
International.  Sightings, landings, and winterings are, 
in all cases, the first recorded,  there  may have  been  previous ones for some 
islands.  The <i>italic</i> number after the coordinates is the Universal Decimal 
Classification (for  use in Polar Libraries) reference.  
<p>

and the first landing was probably in  1821 by sealers.  The first men to winter on the 
continent did so in 1899 (although at least three other  parties  had  previously wintered  at  
comparable latitudes: two on the South Shetland Islands and one aboard a vessel  south  of  
Peter  I &oslashy).  Scientific stations have been open continuously since 1943.</dl>
