<H3>Safe for Now:  Senate to Vote on Revised Counter-Terrorism Bill in September</H3>
On Friday August 2, the House of Representatives passed a revised counter-terrorism bill by a margin of 389 to 22.  The bill does not contain provisions relating to encryption or expanded wiretapping authority.  
<P>
However, the Senate did not vote on the bill before they recessed for the month.  The Senate will take up consideration of the bill when Congress returns in September.  So while the current version of the bill does not contain the privacy-threatening provisions that were previously discussed, they will likely resurface when the Senate considers the bill.
<P>
In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
<P>
Thanks to everyone who called Congress to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill!
