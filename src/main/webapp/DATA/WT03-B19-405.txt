<H1>Egypt and climate change</H1>
<HR>
<B>Egypt's large and tightly-packed population makes the country highly 
vulnerable to climate change.</B> The population is expected to rise from 47.6 million 
in 1985 to 66.7 million by the year 2000, making Egypt the fifteenth most populated 
country in the world. This expanding population will remain concentrated in a narrow strip 
along the fertile banks of the Nile river and delta. The increasing population density of this 
area will reduce Egypt's flexibility and options for responding to climate change impacts. 
<P>
<B>Egypt does not grow enough food to feed its current population. </B>Although 
the Nile River valley contains fertile land, most of Egypt is arid. The government is 
attempting to convert some of the desert to agriculture, but this new farmland is relatively 
inefficient and water-intensive. Meanwhile, the country's prime farmland is under intense 
pressure from the housing needs of an expanding population; this has led to an annual loss 
of 30-50 thousand feddan over the last 20 years. The net result is that the annual increase 
in population (2.8%) exceeds the annual increase in agricultural production (2.6%). 
Egypt's imports of food absorb most of its foreign currency, which is therefore not 
available for development. If climate change makes Egypt drier or warmer, <A HREF = 
"fs101.html">pressure on agriculture</A> - much of which is 
dependent on irrigation - would intensify.<P>
<B>The country's <A HREF = "fs104.html">water 
resources</A> are limited.</B> Egypt relies on the Nile for 90% of its water needs, but 
it cannot control the quantity and quality of this water, which depend on activities 
upstream. Although it is one of the world's major rivers, the Nile's average annual 
discharge into the sea is just 86 billion cubic metres, while the Zaire, for example, 
discharges some 1,400 billion cubic metres. The Nile loses a considerable amount of water 
to swamp areas and to evaporation during its 3000-kilometre course through the arid 
lands of Northern Sudan and southern Egypt. When the remaining water reaches its 
territory, Egypt consumes 48 billion cubic metres of the Nile annually, but, as with 
Ethiopia and Sudan - the other large-scale users of the Nile and its tributaries - its 
demand will increase along with population and development. <A HREF = 
"fs114.html">Competition among these states for water could 
escalate</A> even without climate change. If climate change results in increased warming, 
droughts, and evaporation, reduced flow in the Nile would further exacerbate Egypt's 
problems, and the country could face an explosive situation.<P>
<B>Egypt's Mediterranean Coast and the Nile Delta may be vulnerable to sea-level 
rise.</B> The most likely result of climate change is a rise in global average temperature, 
which would in turn cause sea-levels to rise by up to one metre by the year 2100, 
inundating coastlines (fact sheet 102). Scientists are unsure how a general sea-level rise 
would impact Egypt's coastline. Some argue that the Nile Delta would "float" upwards 
with rising sea-levels, while others suggest that the Mediterranean may or may not share in 
a global sea-level rise. What is clear, though, is that if sea-water inundation did occur, 
densely-inhabited areas of the Delta would be affected, leading to the displacement of 
people and the loss of fertile land. If instead the delta "rises" with the sea, new problems 
with water flow may occur; already, the Aswan High Dam and other river control schemes 
along the Nile have reduced the flow of water and sediments to coastal areas, depriving 
them of material to mitigate coastal erosion.<P>
<B>While Egypt is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts, it contributes just a 
fraction of 1% of mankind's total greenhouse gas emissions.</B> According to the 
World Meteorological Organization (WMO), in 1988 Egypt emitted 18,617,000 tons of 
carbon dioxide (mankind's leading greenhouse gas) by burning fossil fuels, representing 
0.34% of total worldwide fossil-fuel emissions. Per-capita carbon dioxide emissions were 
0.36 tons, compared with 5.44 for the US and 2.13 for Japan. National figures for other 
greenhouse gases are more difficult to calculate, but Egypt also emits small quantities of 
methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases. <P>
<B>National environmental policies are coordinated by the Environmental Affairs 
Agency. </B>The Agency was established ten years ago and has a small budget of some 
E£8.4 million (US$3.5 million). The Agency pursues a variety of policies of relevance to 
climate change. For example, it has supported research into gasoline and diesel engine 
motors to determine the best parameters for CO2 and other emissions. The agency is also 
seeking Egypt's compliance with the provisions of the Montreal Protocol on Substances 
That Deplete the Ozone Layer (ozone-depleting CFCs are also greenhouse gases - see 
fact sheet 224); by 1989, the national consumption of CFCs had been reduced from 8,000 
tonnes annually to 5,000. The Agency is also helping to increase carbon "sinks" by 
promoting the creation of new public parks, planting more trees along the main roads, and 
establishing green belts around all of the big cities.<P>
<B>Egyptian society is increasingly aware of environmental issues, including 
climate change.</B> Serious research work and projects on climatic issues are being 
pursued by Egyptian universities and institutes, most notably Cairo University. Seminars, 
workshops, and meetings on climate change and other environmental issues are also held 
regularly. For example, in January 1992 the US Environment Protection Agency, the 
University of Colorado, and Cairo University held a climate change workshop, and Cairo 
University held a seminar on the Nile Delta. Meanwhile, a number of non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) are investing their energies in environmental issues. In the political 
arena, the parliament has debated environmental issues and promulgated several 
environment-related laws, and a Green political party has been formed.     <P>
<B>The Egyptian media is paying more and more attention to environmental issues 
such as climate change.</B> The most important example is probably the Weekly 
Environment Page published every Sunday in Al Ahram Daily, but other daily and weekly 
newspapers also feature regular articles and interviews on environmental subjects. A 
weekly programme on environment is broadcast on an Egyptian radio network, and a new 
weekly television programme called "Environmental and the People" is being planned by 
the editor of the Al Ahram Daily' Weekly Environment Page. In addition, religious 
television programmes often deal with environmental issues and the emphasis that the 
Koran places on environmental balance.<P>
