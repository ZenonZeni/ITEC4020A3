FEDERAL CIRCUIT FINDS
PTO ERRED IN REJECTING
PATENT FOR OBVIOUSNESS.TEXT

     Both a Patent and Trademark Office patent examiner and the
PTO's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences erred when they
ruled that "similar" elements of a chemical compound are
"identical" elements and, therefore, that a patent application
should be rejected as being obvious in light of the prior art,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Dec. 11.
In re Ochiai et al., No. 92-1446 (Fed. Cir.).

     In 1992, the Patent and Trademark Office's Board of Patent
Appeals and Interferences upheld a patent examiner's rejection of
claims 6-10 of Michihiko Ochiai's patent application Serial
No. 07/462,492 for a method of making "a cephem compound having
antibiotic properties" for obviousness in view of the combined
teachings of six prior art references.

     The principal claim, claim 6, describes the use of a new,
non-obvious acid to make a new, non-obvious cephem, but the
examiner ruled that it actually describes a "standard,
conventional" process starting with an acylation agent (amino
acid) that is only "slightly different" from the prior art to
result in a final product that is only "slightly different."

     On appeal, the board upheld the rejection, agreeing with the
examiner that there was nothing non-obvious in the particular
process chosen and claimed by the appellants.

     The Federal Circuit reversed that finding, however, finding
that the PTO failed to apply the required statutory test of
obviousness under federal patent law, 35 U.S.C. sec. 103, which
requires that one compare the claim's subject matter as a whole
with the prior art to which it pertains.

     In this case, the process that Ochiai recites in claim 6
requires the use of a new, non-obvious acid as one of the
starting materials and, therefore, that claim cannot be obvious,
the circuit court ruled.

     "One having no knowledge of this acid could hardly find it
obvious to make any cephem using this acid as an acylating agent,
much less the particular cephem recited in claim 6.  In other
words, it would not have been obvious to those of ordinary skill
in the art to choose the particular acid of claim 6 as the
acylating agent for the known amine for the simple reason that
the particular acid was unknown but for Ochiai's disclosure in
the 429 application," the court said.

     The examiner incorrectly drew from case law a general
obviousness rule, that a process claim is obvious if the prior
art references disclose the same general process using similar
starting materials, the Federal Circuit found.  However, the
court said, "similarity is...not necessarily obviousness," and
the PTO cannot make up any such per se rules of obviousness for
its own convenience in violation of the fact-intensive
requirement of sec. 103 of the federal patent law.

     "Per se rules that eliminate the need for fact-specific
analysis of claims and prior art may be administratively
convenient for PTO examiners and the Board.  Indeed, they have
been sanctioned by the Board as well.  But reliance on per se
rules of obviousness is legally incorrect and must cease," the
appellate panel declared.

     Ochiai was represented by Harold C. Wegner, Herbert I.
Cantor and Douglas P. Mueller of Foley & Lardner, Washington, DC.
The PTO was represented by Fred E. McKelvey, Nancy J. Linck, Lee
E. Barrett, John W. Dewhirst, Albin F. Drost and Richard E.
Schafer of the Solicitor's Office of the PTO, Arlington, VA.

CLASS ACTION FILED
AGAINST AHF MAKERS BY
COLORADO HEMOPHILIACS.TEXT

     A multi-count Colorado District Court negligence and breach
of warranty class action was filed Oct. 5 by a seven-member group
seeking to represent individuals with " or survivors of persons
who contracted " HIV through tainted antihemophilic factor (AHF)
concentrate in the early 1980s.  Morabito et al. v. Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer et al., No. 95-CV-4409 (CO Dist. Ct., Denver Cty.).

     Targeting Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc., Armour Pharmaceutical
Co, Inc., Miles Inc., Baxter Healthcare Corp., Alpha Therapeutic
Corp., and the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF), the suit
alleges that the defendants failed to warn hemophiliacs of the
risk of using AHF or employ available processing measures that
would have reduced the incidence of tainted blood.  It also
accuses the pharmaceutical companies of distributing knowingly
HIV-tainted AHF while working to enact infection control measures
and telling hemophiliacs the products were safe.

     The NHF, according to the suit, acted in a "willful and
malicious" manner by presenting itself as an impartial watchdog
for the welfare of hemophiliacs while failing to disclose to its
membership that it was funded "almost entirely from contributions
and other financial support given by the defendant manufacturers
and other affiliated organizations."  NHF's Medical and
Scientific Advisory Committee, according to the suit, was stacked
with physicians who "had received and were continuing to receive
monetary payments from the defendant manufacturers to carry out
their scientific research and, in some cases, to fund clinical
trials for the testing of products manufactured by the defendant
manufacturers."

     The suit asserts claims of negligence, strict liability,
breach of implied warranty, and outrageous conduct against the
pharmaceutical companies and includes a separate liability claim
against NHF.

     "By December 1982, the manufacturers were belatedly
developing new manufacturing techniques to reduce the viral
contamination of AHF products but, in the interim, continued to
aggressively promote and sell their existing AHF products knowing
or having reason to know that said products were defective and
harmful," says the suit.  "Notwithstanding the mounting body of
medical and scientific information in 1982, that AIDS was likely
of viral etiology and the certain knowledge at that stage that it
was blood-borne, the defendants, without any serious basis on
which to dispute such inferences, represented or caused to be
represented that the risk to persons with hemophilia associated
with the use of AHF products was remote and that the likelihood
of a person with hemophilia developing AIDS as a result of AHF
use was insignificant."

     Further, the complaint says, "[d]uring the time frame that
such information was given and produced, it was known that the
hemophilia community and their medical treaters would reasonably
rely on such information and representations coming as they did
from organizations they supposed were in a position of a higher
level of knowledge on the subject matter.  The hemophilia
community supposed that defendants would be acting in accordance
with the best and most conservative state of the medical and
scientific art and be faithful to their legal, ethical and moral
obligations to the thousands of persons with hemophilia."

     The suit was filed by Denver attorneys William E. Brayshaw
and Larry F. Hobbs.

U.S. SUP. CT. LETS STAND
FINDING NIH SCIENTISTS
ARE NOT CO-INVENTORS

     The U.S. Supreme Court on Jan. 16 let stand a ruling by the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that two
National Institutes of Health scientists merely helped Burroughs
Wellcome Co. reduce its patented invention of the AIDS drug AZT
to practice and are not its co-inventors.  Barr Laboratories Inc.
v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., No. 94-1527 (U.S.); Novopharm Inc. et
al v. Burroughs Wellcome Co., No. 94-1531 (U.S.); see
Pharmaceutical LR, May 1995.

     The Federal Circuit ruling affirmed that Burroughs Wellcome
(BW) is the sole owner of five of six patents for the drug and
that two companies seeking to market generic versions of it are
liable for infringement.  The issue involved hundreds of millions
of dollars in revenues for the rival companies because AZT is one
of the few drugs approved for treatment of AIDS and is prescribed
to nearly all AIDS patients.

     BW began experimenting with different compounds to determine
their effectiveness for treating AIDS in the early 1980s.  At the
same time, scientists at the NIH had developed a test that could
demonstrate a compound's effectiveness against HIV, the
retrovirus that causes AIDS.

     On Feb. 6, 1985, BW's five inventors had prepared a draft
patent application for filing in the United Kingdom.  Two days
earlier, it had sent samples of AZT and other compounds to NIH
for blind testing against its HIV cell line.  When the NIH tests
showed that the compound was active against HIV, BW filed its
patent application in the United Kingdom on March 16, 1985.

     BW subsequently applied for and received the six U.S.
patents for AZT.  After receiving Food and Drug Administration
approval, it began marketing the drug in 1987 under the trademark
Retrovir.

     Barr Laboratories, and then Novopharm Ltd. of Canada, sought
to manufacture generic versions of AZT.  BW filed complaints of
patent infringement against the two companies in the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina.  Both
companies admitted that their generic versions would infringe on
BW's patents, but they claimed BW's patents are invalid and
unenforceable for inequitable conduct because BW failed to name
the two NIH researchers, Drs. Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya,
as co-inventors.

     In July 1993, more than three weeks into what appeared would
be a lengthy trial, U.S. District Judge Malcolm J. Howard issued
a directed verdict for BW, finding the company the sole inventor
of the six patents.

     Barr and Novopharm then appealed to the Federal Circuit,
which affirmed Judge Howard's ruling for five of the patents but
found a significant material fact in dispute on the sixth patent.
According to the circuit court opinion, the central issue of the
case was the question of when the BW inventors conceived their
invention.

     Barr and Novopharm had contended that an inventor's idea
must include a reasonable expectation that an invention will work
for its intended purpose before conception is complete.  In this
case, they argued, conception was not completed until the two NIH
scientists proved that AZT is effective against HIV.  Therefore,
they said, the NIH researchers should have been named as co-
inventors.

     However, the Federal Circuit found that an inventor does not
need to prove that his invention will work for its conception to
be complete.  It is enough for the inventor to prove that he had
a definite and permanent idea that someone skilled in the art
could understand, the panel said.  In this case, BW had in fact
fully conceived the AZT invention by the time it prepared the
draft application for the United Kingdom patent, which was
prepared before the NIH test results were known, the panel found.

     Barr was represented by Dan Webb, Eric L. Hirschhorn, George
C. Lombardi, James F. Hurst and Monique M. Vasilchik of Winston &
Strawn in Chicago.  Novopharm was represented by Robert F. Green,
Bruce M. Gagala and Jeffrey S. Ward of Leydig, Voit & Mayer, also
in Chicago.

     Burroughs Wellcome was represented by E. Anthony Figg of
Rothwell, Figg, Ernst & Kurz, Washington, DC; and Thomas F.
Curnin, Laura Mezey, Daniel L. Cantor and Michael B. Weiss of
Cahill, Gorgon & Reindel of New York City.

BRIEF FILED SUPPORTING
MERRELL'S APPLICATION
FOR WRIT OF ERROR

     Amici curiae The Chemical Manufacturers Association, The
Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America and The Texas
Chemical Council on Dec. 14 filed with the Texas Supreme Court a
brief in support of Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s
application for writ of error in Ernest and Marilyn Havner's suit
alleging that the drug Bendectin caused their daughter's
limb-reduction defect.  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.
Havner, No. 95-1036 (TX Sup. Ct.); see Pharmaceutical LR, October
1995.

     Merrell contended in its application for writ of error that
the appellate court's decision in this case not only does
injustice between the parties, it eviscerates the standard of the
admissibility of scientific expert testimony that the Texas
Supreme Court recently articulated in E.I. duPont de Nemours and
Co., Inc. v. Robinson, 38 Sup.Ct.J. 852 (June 15, 1995).

     "Indeed, the expert testimony in this case amounts to no
more than guesswork and surmise disguised in a deceptive mantle
of scientific certainty.  As this Court held in Robinson, such
unreliable evidence is inadmissible under Rule 702, and as this
Court concluded in Parker [v. Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co.
of Wisconsin, 440 S.W.2d 43,47 (Tex, 1969)], evidence of a mere
possibility, even if properly admitted, is insufficient to
sustain a jury verdict," Merrell claimed.
               Merrell's Nov. 16 application pointed to three specific
points of error:

     " "The court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court's
     submission to the jury of unreliable and irrelevant
     causation evidence";

     " "The Havners' expert testimony was legally insufficient to
     establish causation"; and

     " "Merrell was denied due process of law as guaranteed by
     the United States and Texas Constitutions."

     Merrell asked the state's high court to grant writ of error,
reverse the appellate court and render judgment that the Havners
take nothing.

     In their brief in support, the amici offered three central
arguments:

     " "The en banc opinion accepts expert testimony contrary to
     the scientific consensus that Bendectin does not cause birth
     defects";

     " "The en banc opinion contradicts overwhelming precedent
     rejecting respondents' expert testimony"; and

     " "The en banc opinion ignores Robinson's requirement that
     expert scientific testimony be derived by scientific methods
     and reflect 'scientific knowledge.'"

     The brief concluded, "In Robinson, this Court reiterated
that expert testimony must satisfy a threshold standard of
reliability and relevancy before reaching a jury.  Regardless of
how that threshold is articulated, the expert testimony offered
by Respondents cannot pass muster.  This is particularly true
given the uniform body of case law reaching the same conclusion
in other Bendectin cases.  For these reasons, the Court should
grant Petitioner's application for writ of error and reverse the
judgment of the trial court."

     In their suit, the Havners alleged that the prescription
anti-nausea medicine Bendectin, used by Mrs. Havner during her
pregnancy, caused a limb-reduction defect of their daughter's
right hand.  On Oct. 4, 1991, a state court jury in Corpus
Christi, TX, awarded the Havners $30 million in punitive damages
and $3.75 million in compensatory damages; punitive damages were
later reduced to $20 million.  In March 1994, the court threw out
the jury verdict in favor of the Havners, finding that they had
failed to present anything more than suspicion on the essential
element of causation.  The court then granted rehearing en banc,
heard oral argument before the entire court and, in August 1995,
affirmed the judgment below with regard to liability and actual
damages, but reversed that part of the jury verdict awarding
punitive damages.

     The court held that, in reviewing the factual sufficiency of
evidence, a court could only exercise its jurisdiction over
factual sufficiency to prevent a manifestly unjust result; it
could not reweigh the evidence and set aside a jury verdict
merely because the judges feel that a different result is more
reasonable.  It said a jury is the sole judge of the credibility
of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony.
Here, it said, each of the witnesses was extensively cross-
examined; flaws in their credentials, methodological
disagreements and errors of omission in their testimony were
explored by opposing counsel; and each of the experts' work was
criticized by an expert for the opposing party.  After reweighing
the evidence to determine if the jury's verdict is so contrary to
the greater weight of the evidence so as to be manifestly unjust,
the court concluded that the verdict as to causation is supported
by sufficient evidence.

     As for punitive damages, the court concluded that the
evidence "is too weak to support the conclusion that Merrell Dow
was consciously indifferent to an extreme risk that Bendectin
could cause limb reduction defects if taken during the critical
period of pregnancy."

     Merrell's application for writ of error was filed by Robert
L. Dickson, Hall R. Marston and George E. Berry with Dickson,
Carlson & Campillo of Santa Monica, CA; by John L. Hill Jr., Rob
L. Wiley and James E. Essig with Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill &
LaBoon, L.L.P. of Houston; by Steven Goode of Austin, TX; and by
Gene M. Williams with Mehaffy & Weber of Beaumont, TX.

     The amici brief was filed by Clifton T. Hutchinson and Danny
S. Ashby of Hughes & Luce, L.L.P. in Dallas; with Bert Black of
Weinberg & Green LLC in Baltimore; David F. Zoll and Donald D.
Evans of The Chemical Manufacturers Association in Washington,
DC; and Stephen A. Bokat and Robin S. Conrad of the National
Chamber Litigation Center, Inc. in Washington, DC, of counsel.

     The Havners are represented by Barry J. Nace with Paulson,
Nace & Norwind of Washington, DC; by Guy H. Allison and Rebecca
E. Hamilton with Allison & Huerta of Corpus Christi, TX; and by
Robert C. Hilliard and Kevin W. Grillo with Hilliard & Grillo of

MI CT. GRANTS SUMMARY
JUDGMENT TO MERRELL
IN BENDECTIN SUIT

     Finding that the testimony of the plaintiffs' experts was
inadmissible because their methodology was not generally accepted
by teratologists, the Wayne County, MI, Circuit Court on Nov. 27
granted summary judgment to Bendectin manufacturer Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  DePyper et al. v. Navarro et al., No. 83-
303467-NM (MI Cir. Ct., Wayne Cty.).

     "Given the otherwise unexplained incidence of birth defects,
scientific uncertainty as to their origin, and widespread
scientific recognition that Bendectin is not a human teratogen,
it is necessary that there be expert scientific testimony which
demonstrates that more probably than not Bendectin is a human
teratogen and a cause of the injury, and further, that such an
opinion be grounded in generally accepted scientific
methodology," the court said.  The court conducted a Davis/Frye
inquiry, and said it was not concerned with what plaintiffs'
experts finally concluded, but rather the methodology or process
or basis for their conclusions, and whether it is generally
accepted or recognized.

     In determining whether the methodology used by plaintiffs'
experts to establish causation is generally recognized by
teratologists, the court made note of factors established by
Michigan case law, including:  Have the results been published?
Has there been independent or objective verification?  Has there
been independent testing and what are the rates of error?  And
has there been criticism of the method or technique within the
scientific community?

     The court said that, among other factors, "at least two high
quality epidemiological studies showing a strong association
between the substance and the occurrence of a birth defect" are
required to show that a substance is a human teratogen.  In
reaching this conclusion, the court did not reject out of hand
the assertion that in vitro studies, animal studies or structure
activity data have a role in determining whether a substance is a
human teratogen.  But it said these types of data have their own
limitations that inherently limit their usefulness or
applicability, and reliance on such data to form an opinion on
human teratogenicity would basically amount to no more than
speculation.

     "Given the lack of any epidemiological studies that show any
meaningful statistical positive association, this Court finds
that teratologists using generally accepted methodology, could
not conclude that Bendectin can more probably than not cause limb
reduction birth defects in any given case," the court said.  It
accordingly found that the opinions of the plaintiffs' experts
are not supported by a methodology generally accepted by
teratologists, so the opinions of those experts that Bendectin is
a human teratogen are inadmissible because they fail the
Davis/Frye test.  In a footnote, the court said its conclusion
would be the same under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993) (see Pharmaceutical LR, November
1995, P. 10,790), another Bendectin case.  The Daubert test has
not been adopted in Michigan; the Davis/Frye rule is Michigan's
standard governing the admissibility of scientific evidence.  The
court, therefore, granted Merrell's summary judgment motion.
               Lawrence R. DePyper Sr. and Jane N. DePyper filed suit on
behalf of their son and themselves, claiming that Lawrence R.
DePyper Jr.'s limb reduction birth defects were caused by in
utero exposure to Bendectin, which Jane DePyper ingested while
pregnant.  The court granted Merrell's summary judgment motion,
citing two earlier published federal cases.

     However, on appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals reversed
and remanded, stating it was satisfied that the evidentiary rule
in those cases did not comport with Michigan jurisprudence.  The
appellate court said the trial court should conduct a Davis/Frye
inquiry into the question:  "Do impartial and disinterested
experts in the field of teratology generally accept the
methodology employed by plaintiffs' expert in assessing the
impact of in vivo, in vitro, chemical structure and animal
studies in determining teratogenicity?"

     The DePypers were represented by Barry J. Nace with Paulson,
Nace, Norwind & Sellinger of Washington, DC; and by Robert A.
Tyler with Sommers, Schwartz, Silver & Schwartz of Southfield,
MI.  Merrell was represented by Frank C. Woodside III and Fred
Erny with Dinsmore & Shohl of Cincinnati; and by Lamont E.
Buffington with Garan, Lucow, Miller, Seward, Cooper & Becker,
P.C. of Detroit.

$1.5 MILLION AWARDED IN
NEGLIGENCE SUIT AGAINST
NEW YORK BLOOD CENTER

     A New York Supreme Court jury in Manhattan on Dec. 19
awarded $1.5 million to a 16-year-old Staten Island resident who
said New York Blood Center's (NYBC) failure to employ surrogate
marker or Hepatitis B-core antibody tests led to his receipt of
HIV-tainted blood during a 1984 heart operation.  DiPaolo et al.
v. Greater New York Blood Center et al., No. 2751/91, (NY Sup.
Ct., New York Cty.); see Pharmaceutical LR, January 1996.

     Attorneys for both sides disagree, however, whether the
amount will be set off by settlements already obtained by
plaintiff Joseph "Joey" DiPaolo.

     Capping six days of deliberation, the panel, however, ruled
for co-defendant Dr. Richard Golinko, the pediatric cardiologist
who recommended that DiPaolo undergo surgery.  DiPaolo said the
doctor failed to obtain informed consent before allowing the
operation to proceed and accused him of failing to reveal the
existence of a then-pending test to identify HIV antibodies.
Dr. Golinko said such duties were those of DiPaolo's surgeons.

     DiPaolo was operated on at Downstate Medical Center in
Brooklyn, NY, on May 23, 1984.  During the procedure to correct
an atrial septal heart defect, he received some 16 units of NYBC-
supplied blood components.  One of those units was tainted with
the AIDS virus.

     DiPaolo, who tested HIV-positive at age eight, alleged in
his suit that NYBC neglected to "aggressively institute" a
directed donations policy, educate doctors about the risk of
transmitting HIV via blood and blood components, or directly
interrogate donors about any high-risk behaviors.

     In 1993, the surgeons settled with DiPaolo and his family
for $1.2 million.  The hospital entered a separate $400,000
settlement.

     Both sides are expected to file various post-trial motions
before the end of January, including a plaintiff's request for a
new trial on the damages issue.  Plaintiff co-counsel Robert
Jenner says he expects to appeal the jury's charge on the
standard of care question and to ask the court whether the
aggregate $1.6 million settlement DiPaolo received from the
surgeons and hospital is considered, under New York law, a set-
off against the $1.5 million jury verdict.

     NYBC attorney Roger K. Solymosy of Brody & Fabiani in New
York City expressed little concern over the jury's award, saying
that under a recent state appellate court ruling, there is
clearly a set-off against the amounts the plaintiff already
received.  Solymosy says he expects to file several pro forma
post-trial motions on behalf of his client before expiration of a
30-day deadline.

     Jenner says although the jury entered a "very compromised
verdict on damages," DiPaolo is "very pleased that NYBC was held
responsible after avoiding such responsibility in so many cases
to date.  My client, however, still has AIDS whether the award

WIDOW TELLS IL SUP. CT.
$2.14 MILLION NEGLIGENCE
RULING SHOULD BE AFFIRMED

     The widow of a man who died of AIDS as the result of
receiving HIV-tainted blood during a February 1984 heart
operation urged the Illinois Supreme Court on Dec. 11 to second a
state Appellate Court's affirmation of a $2.14 million jury
verdict against United Blood Services (UBS), the supplier of the
bad blood.  Advincula v. United Blood Services, No. 79653 (IL
Sup. Ct.); see Pharmaceutical LR, January 1996.

     Marietta Advincula told the high court the rulings below
should stand and that it should reject the blood bank's assertion
that the trial court misapplied the Illinois Blood Shield Law
(745 ILCS 40/3 [1994]) in judging the case under a "due care"
rather than a "professional liability" standard based on
adherence to industry practice.  The 75-page brief says that even
if UBS were judged under the latter test, the verdict would stand
by virtue of its failure to follow internal procedures at the
1984 blood drive during which the implicated "John Donor"
provided the tainted blood.  UBS barred him from giving blood
once a 1986 donation proved HIV-positive.

     "UBS' fundamental position is that 'only a failure to adhere
to [professional] standards can give rise to liability' [emphasis
added]," says the Advincula brief.  "Both the circuit court and
the appellate court were correct in rejecting this
argument...because it conflicts with the plain language of the
Blood Shield Law and violates fundamental principles of statutory
interpretation....  The Blood Shield Law states that a blood bank
warrants that it has 'exercised due care and followed
professional standards of care in providing the service according
to the current state of the medical arts [emphasis added].  This
language, and in particular, the conjunctive 'and,' plainly
imposes two requirements " a blood bank must exercise due care
and follow professional standards of care."

     Advincula says the court should reject the asserted UBS
interpretation of sec. 40/3, that blood banks are "to exercise
due care in following professional standards of care."  Because
neither that interpretation, nor those offered in amicus
petitions by the American Red Cross, the American Association of
Blood Banks and Abbott Laboratories, says the plaintiff, "adheres
to the language the Legislature did adopt, they all should be
rejected."

     Adds Advincula, "[T]he phrases 'exercised due care' and
'followed professional standard of care' describes the means by
which a blood bank is to fulfill this responsibility.
Accordingly, compliance with professional standards of care is
not necessarily conclusive evidence that a blood bank has
satisfied its duty of care.  If such standards do not incorporate
currently known and available safeguards at the time of the blood
donation at issue, then compliance with them is not enough."

     The brief says that despite knowledge held by UBS in early
1983 that homosexual men should be barred from donating blood and
that any of several surrogate marker tests would have almost
eliminated the threat of HIV in the blood supply, UBS took no
such action.  Surrogate tests, it adds, were rejected on a
business basis because of their cost.  The suit over the AIDS
death of Ronaldo Advincula, says the brief, is not grounded on
medical malpractice claims as intimated by UBS, because the final
authority over whether to implement surrogate tests rested with
then-UBS Chief Executive Officer Hayle Rudolph.

     Responding to the claim UBS made in its Illinois Supreme
Court brief, Advincula says she is not required to show that her
late husband would have avoided HIV infection if any of five
discussed surrogate tests were in effect in February 1984.
Testimony from her experts, she says, indicated that any of the
tests would have been effective in disqualifying HIV-positive
donors.  The Hepatitis B Core Antibody test, said plaintiff
expert Dr. Thomas Asher, was the most thorough test available,
while another plaintiff expert estimated there was a 100%
probability that the test would have excluded John Donor's blood
in 1984.

     The Advincula brief states that even if UBS were to be
judged under a professional standard, as it wishes, the jury's
verdict would still stand, based on the blood bank's failure to
adhere to its own operating procedures.  "UBS argues that nothing
UBS could have done would have kept John Donor from donating
because he did not think he was at risk for AIDS," argues the
plaintiff.  "The evidence, however, showed that John Donor was a
gay man...; that gay men were at highest risk for AIDS...; and
that UBS did not adequately educate John Donor before and during
the blood drive about those who were at risk for AIDS and should
not donate blood....  The evidence also showed that had UBS used
proper screening methods at a properly conducted blood drive,
John Donor would have excluded himself or been deferred.  It was
undisputed that UBS did nothing to educate John Donor before or
after he arrived at the blood drive."

     Concluded the brief, "Additionally, contrary to UBS' claim,
John Donor testified that he never received any 'disqualifying
information' in any of the years he donated blood from 1983 to
1986....  Thus, UBS' argument that better screening in 1984 would
have made no difference because John Donor donated in 1985 and
1986 when UBS gave more specific information to donors...is
without merit.  Further, the jury could well have concluded that
had UBS educated John Donor properly in 1984, he would not have
donated then."  Because UBS failed to obtain written
acknowledgment from the donor in 1984 that he had read and
understood the blood bank's "Important Message" notice on AIDS,
adds Advincula, "UBS' negligence in this regard violated the
industry practices and UBS' own policy."

     Advincula is represented by Judith Fors and Margaret Byrne
of Chicago; and by Maureen Witt, Elizabeth Phelan and Carlos
Samour of Holland & Hart in Denver.  UBS is represented by

ARIZONA JUDGE CERTIFIES
PARTIAL HIV/BLOOD CLASS
ACTION ON TIME ISSUE.TEXT

     Although rejecting class proceedings on negligence,
liability and failure to warn claims, a U.S. District Court judge
in Tucson on Dec. 4 granted partial class action status to all
Arizonans infected with HIV via blood transfusions between July
1982 and March 1985.  Doe et al. v. American Red Cross et al.,
No. CV 94-521 TUC RMB (D AZ).

     Judge Richard M. Bilby ruled that lead plaintiff Jane Doe,
the widow of an AIDS-infected blood recipient, failed to show the
case met the class certification requirements of FRCP 23(b)(1)(A)
because there are too many individual variables for class
members, including time and medical factors.  A  partial class
action, however, is appropriate for class determination of
another issue under FRCP 23(b)(3), said the judge.  That issue
is:

     At that point in time, if ever, between 1982 and 1985
     was sufficient information available to cause a reasonable
     blood components provider to adopt screening and testing
     procedures to protect Arizona transfusion recipients from
     the transmission of HIV.

     Because "individual questions of fact predominate over
common questions of law or fact," said Judge Bilby, the class
action device is not a "superior means of adjudicating this
entire controversy."  Even if a class were certified on the
liability, negligence and failure to warn claims, the judge noted
that "a great deal of time and expense would be involved in the
conduct of individual trials necessary to determine liability as
to each potential member, creating great difficulties in the
management of the litigation."

     On the certified issue, however, the order held, "What a
jury will determine on a class-wide basis is whether, and if so
when, the defendants had the knowledge needed to eliminate or
reduce the risk of HIV-tainted blood being used for transfusion."
The jury, noted Judge Bilby, "will not reach the question of
ultimate liability of any defendant to any particular plaintiff."

     The judge said class certification of the time issue
satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) because it aids in
efficient case management.  "The time that the knowledge was
available is the same in each individual case although each
plaintiff may have been affected differently," said the
certification order.  "The class issue of available knowledge at
a particular time is much more narrow than negligence.  If the
jury determines a date at which time sufficient knowledge was
available that a reasonable blood provider would have implemented
donor screening and blood testing measures, that date serves to
include and exclude plaintiffs.  This will greatly aid in the
fair and speedy adjudication of this controversy by deciding a
key issue that is common to each claim and will not need to be
relitigated."

     Added Judge Bilby, "...[T]his is not the type of issue that
an individual plaintiff would have a strong interest in
controlling.  The availability of knowledge at a certain point in
time is not particular to any plaintiff and does not require a
venture into her lifestyle and personal circumstances.  The
determination of knowledge availability is distinct from its
impact on any one person."

     In addition to lead defendant American Red Cross, other
named defendants include United Blood Services (UBS), a division
of Blood Systems, Inc., the American Association of Blood Banks
(AABB), Council of Community Blood Centers (CCBC), and the
University of Arizona.

     In an Oct. 16 opposition brief, the Red Cross said there are
no common issues which would lend to class resolution and that
Doe's suit fails to meet the requirements of either FRCP
23(b)(1)(A) or 23(b)(3).  "[E]ven if plaintiff's issues were
certified for class action treatment, not only damages, but even
the defendants' liability to each individual class member would
still have to be litigated separately," said the Red Cross.
"Thus, the class certification plaintiff requests will result in
mere advisory opinions on certain abstract issues.  Moreover,
those advisory will not meaningfully advance the litigation, or
even save time in the individual class member trials that must
follow the class issue trial, because the bulk of the evidence
will have to be presented and considered again in the individual
class member trials."

     The plaintiffs are represented by Rose Marie Ibanez of
Ibanez and Wilkinson, and J. Patrick Butler of Dickerson, Butler,
Rabb & Rodriguez, P.C., both in Tucson.  The Red Cross is
represented by Joseph E. Mais and Samuel A. Thumma of Brown &
Bain in Phoenix; and Tracy L. Merritt, William H. Forman and
Jacqueline R. Denning (of counsel) of Arnold & Porter in
Washington, DC.  Foster Robberson of Lewis & Roca in Phoenix
represents UBS.  CCBC is represented by Ellen Wheeler of Tucson.
The AABB is represented by Tom Manning of O'Connor, Cohn, Dillon
& Barr in San Francisco.  Michael W. Capp of Weyl, Guyer, MacBan
& Olson in Tucson represents the University of Arizona.

CIBA ARGUES THAT NEGLIGENCE
CLAIMS BY CA WOMAN ARE
PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW.TEXT

     Approved labels and warnings on medical devices are
"specific requirements" of federal law that preempt causes of
action brought under state law, respondent Ciba Vision Corp.
argued in its answer to a petition filed by a California woman
asking the state Supreme Court to overturn a lower court's ruling
that all of her claims against Ciba are preempted by the Medical
Devices Amendments (MDA).  Scott v. Ciba Vision Corp.,
No. S049608 (CA Sup. Ct.); see Pharmaceutical LR, January 1996.

     In its Nov. 15 answer, Ciba contended that the California
Court of Appeal, Sixth District, was aligned with a majority of
jurisdictions that have held that federal law preempts causes of
action brought under state law.

     Appellant Leslie Scott brought suit in California state
court against Ciba, alleging claims of strict liability,
negligence, failure to provide adequate warnings and breach of
implied warranty.  Scott claimed she had difficulty in
distinguishing Ciba's AOSEPT solution, which contains hydrogen
peroxide, from its saline solution.  She claimed that as a result
of her failure to distinguish between the bottles, she suffered
chemical burns to her eyes when she rinsed her contacts in the
AOSEPT solution instead of the saline solution.

     Scott argued that, around the time of her injury, Ciba had
begun to market its AOSEPT solution with a red cap, but also
continued to market it in the old bottle, knowing that persons
not wearing their contacts would have difficulty in
distinguishing the two.

     The Santa Clara County Superior Court granted Ciba's motion
for summary judgment, finding Scott's claims preempted by the
MDA.  On appeal, the California Court of Appeal, Sixth District,
affirmed the trial court.

     The Court of Appeal cited to Evraets v. Intermedics
Intraocular, Inc., 29 Cal.App.4th 786, and 21 C.F.R. sec.
808.1(b), in holding that the "requirement" the Food and Drug
Administration refers to in sec. 360k includes "any requirement
having the force and effect of law 'whether established by
statute, ordinance, regulation, or court decision.'"

     Examining Scott's argument that the MDA contains no specific
counterpart regulations regarding AOSEPT, the Court of Appeal
held that all Class III medical devices are subject to the
requirements of the MDA, which include the FDA's stringent
premarket approval (PMA) process.

     In her petition to the California Supreme Court, Scott
argued that the only other state Supreme Court that has addressed
the issue of federal preemption concerning Class III devices
found that the plaintiff's claims were not preempted (Larsen v.
Pacesetter Systems, Inc. [Hawaii 1992], 837 P.2d 1273, 1281).

     Some of the leading cases that have expounded on the issue
of preemption have recently been criticized, Scott said.  For
example, the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' 1984 ruling in
Martello v. Ciba Vision Corp. gave sec. 360k(a), the MDA's
preemption provision, an expansive reading, but was criticized in
the Ninth Circuit's ruling in Kennedy, Scott said.  "The...Ninth
Circuit in Kennedy...stated that the language of [sec.] 360k(a)
does not create the broad, sweeping preemption found by the
'strained reading of the statute' by the court in Martello,"
Scott argued.

     And, Scott said, state actions that attempt to enforce
federal standards are not preempted.  Citing to Evraets, the
appellant said, regarding a claim of negligence per se, since the
state requirements are equal to the federal requirements because
they adopt the federal standards, they are not preempted.

     On the other hand, Ciba argued in its answer that a
consistent line of cases holds that state law tort and warranty
causes of action are preempted because the pre-market approval
process envelopes the approved product in specific requirements
of federal law.

     "Scott makes no claim of any defect in the design or
manufacture of AOSEPT," Ciba said.  "Rather, she contends that
California tort and warranty law required that Ciba Vision
package and label AOSEPT differently in order to warn users
against accidental placement of deneutralized solution in the
eye."

     Ciba argued that this is a "strong case for MDA preemption"
because of AOSEPT's premarket approval and Scott's singular focus
on warning deficiencies in the product.

     The respondent said that the court's decision in Evraets,
which Scott cited in her petition, does not warrant review by the
state Supreme Court.  Ciba said Evraets does not deal with a
device that received FDA premarket approval.

     "Evraets contains a discussion of the preemption of state
law claims for breach of warranty that is consistent with the
decision in Scott," Ciba said.  "Evraets only reaches the issue
of preemption in relation to a claim of breach of an express
warranty."

     Ciba concluded that by enacting the MDA, Congress interposed
the FDA as an expert watchdog and preempted certain state law
causes of action.  A jury ought not be allowed to rethink the
sufficiency of labels and packaging that the FDA endorsed, said
Ciba.

     Scott is represented by Jonathan D. Gordon of the Law
Offices of Jonathan D. Gordon in Denver.  Ciba is represented by
