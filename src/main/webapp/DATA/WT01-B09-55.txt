<B>Project Title: Design Optimization and Proof Testing of
Safety Containment Systems for Flywheel
Energy Storage Systems (FESS)  <p>

Performing Organization: Tribology Systems, Inc.  <p></B>

<B>Project Summary:</B><p>

The TSIproprietary FESS safety containment design consists of a computer
coordinated system of several simple, lowcost, yet powerful devices, combined in a unique manner,
for the safe dissipation of all the flywheel kinetic energy at full FESS design speed. The initial design
analyses are now completed, and the first proof test will be conducted with WFC s commercial
stationary FESS containment system using an intentionally defective, 500Wh gross energy, 30,000rpm
maximum design speed flywheel, to simulate the highly unlikely event of a catastrophic composite ring
failure in service. Second and third proof tests are planned on the current project, with design
modifications based on the results of the first test, and including lightweight containment materials. A
key characteristic of our system is a simple, lightweight device that absorbs flywheel energy at an initial
computed rate greater than a megawatt and is designed to activate in 0.2 millisecond after the ruptured
flywheel friction torque on its crash ring starts to rotate the containment housing in its own bearings,
designed to survive 1.8 million pounds shock load, twice the maximum possible impact of a ruptured
flywheel fragment. 
<p>
The entire FESS for stationary applications is mounted inside a square cabinet on the floor, with a
special design to provide immediate self centering of the flywheel fragments while they still have
significant kinetic energy. In this way, the initial impact unbalance will last no more than a millisecond or
two, and will have no more serious effect on the assembled unit than a Design Optimization and Proof
Testing of Safety Containment Systems for Flywheel Energy Storage Systems (FESS) washing
machine walking across the floor in its spindry mode. The contact surfaces of the flywheel on the crash
ring will have a TSIpatented, zerooutgassing, solidlubrication system to prevent excessive damage and
heating of the interface, and to minimize flywheel disintegration. 
<p>
After the flywheel disintegrates into a fluidlike slurry, its maximum possible residual kinetic energy has
been computed and converted into a centrifugal pressure inside the containment housing and the
resulting loads on the housing capscrews. Analysis shows that the computed maximum stress in the
housing is a factor of four below the ASME boiler code allowable stress and the capscrew loads are a
factor of five below their rated breaking strength. Testing will be performed at Oak Ridge National
Laboratories and will include highresponse recording and highspeed photography of all critical
parameters in the testing of our complete systems, so that we can improve the accuracy of our
analyses and learn how to simplify and reduce the weight and cost of our system for EV and HEV
applications. <p>

<B>Project Deliverables:</B> <p> Final report giving all the results of the analyses and tests, including generic
engineering rules for FESS containment designs for both stationary and lightweight vehicular
applications.  <p>

<B>Project Schedule:</B> <p><ul><li> The first test will be performed June 1996, the second in September 1996, and
the third test and final report will be completed during December 1996.</ul>
