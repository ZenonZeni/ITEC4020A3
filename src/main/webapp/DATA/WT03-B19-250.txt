In addition to the wage or salary, a number of employee benefits and on-costs 
are paid by employers. These include:

<P>
<DD>Four weeks paid annual leave per annum.</DD>

<P>
<DT><I>Superannuation</I></DT>
<P>
<DD>About four-fifths of Australias employees are now covered by some form 
of occupational superannuation. A range of schemes exist. Most provide 
for the employer to make a contribution, and many provide for 
employee contributions also. 
<P>
Since 1 July 1992, a Commonwealth Superannuation 
Guarantee Charge (SGC) has been in operation, under which employers who do 
not provide the minimum levels of contribution for their employees are 
required to pay a charge to the Australian Taxation Office. The charge is 
equivalent to any shortfall in the prescribed minimum superannuation 
contributions plus an additional administration charge and a proxy for 
fund earnings, none of which are tax deductible. The minimum levels of 
superannuation increase annually as shown in the following table. </DD>

<P>
<DL>
<DD>About 70% of employees are covered by industrial awards which require 
employers to contribute an amount of superannuation equivalent to at least 5% 
of the workers salary.
<P>
Employer superannuation contributions made under industrial awards contribute 
to wards meeting the SGC minimum contribution levels. All employer 
contributions to an eligible superannuation fund and income derived 
from the fund are taxed at the concessional rate of 15%.</DD>
<P>

<DT><I>WorkCover - Victoria's workers compensation scheme</I></DT>
<P>
<DD>Victorian workers who sustain a workplace injury are covered under 
WorkCover. A major emphasis of the scheme is on returning injured employees 
to work. Basic rates of premium payable by employers vary between 0.4% 
and 7.0% of gross salary paid to employees, depending upon the degree of 
risk attached to the industrial activity at each workplace. These basic 
rates are adjusted up or down depending upon the employers claims experience. 
The standard rates of premium payable by employers in several industries are 
shown below.
