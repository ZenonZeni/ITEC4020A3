</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=4 valign=top>Reading</td>
<td valign=top>1.</td>
<td>Listen to "good readers" read age-appropriate (not "skill" level) material while eyeing the printed page; avoid listening to poor readers reading.</td>
</tr>

<tr> 
<td>2.</td>
<td valign=top>Use talking books, listen to tapes, and view films and filmstrips for information; if necessary, read salient material using well-prepared course handouts and worksheets. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top>3.</td>
<td>Read silently for meaning, but never read aloud.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top>4.</td>
<td>Test orally and provide a reader and recorder for necessary written 
tests (such as the college entrance examinations and group 
achievement tests).<br><br></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td rowspan=2 valign=top>Word finding<br>
Vocabulary<br>
Reading comprehension<br>
Picture-word association&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td valign=top>1.
<td>Use picture-to-word matching tasks (including associating names and faces) for vocabulary development.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top> 2.</td>
<td>Test both orally and in writing using multiple-choice, true-false, yes-no, or circle-the-correct-answer formats; avoid both oral and written "fill-in the blank" testing situations. <br><br></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top rowspan=4>Spelling</td>
<td valign=top>1.</td>
<td>Look at word while simultaneously hearing the word spoken.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >2.</td>
<td>Test spelling by multiple-choice format using age-appropriate (not 
"skill" level) words.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top >3.</td>
<td>Use The Bad Speller's Dictionary (New York, Random House, 1974). 
</td>
</tr>
<td valign=top >4.</td>
<td>Use a good speller as a secretary or write using computer word 
processor with appropriate spell-checking software. <br><br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top rowspan=4>Writing</td>
<td valign=top >1.</td>
<td>Encourage oral expression or demonstration instead of written tasks.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >2.</tr>
<td>Allow the child to dictate information or answers into a tape recorder 
or directly to a secretary. 
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >3.</td>
<td>Use a circle-the-correct-answer written text format.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >4.</td>
<td>Provide computer with word-processing software that contains a built-in dictionary and thesaurus. <br><br></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top rowspan=4>Computation<br>
Arithmetic<br>
 Mathematics</td>
<td valign=top >1.</td>
<td>Pursue instruction of age-appropriate (not "skill level") 
mathematical  concepts and principles, avoiding specific 
calculations.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >2</td>
<td>For instruction of computation, teach by example showing both 
correct and incorrect responses.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >3.</td>
<td>Provide calculators and/or computers with appropriate software to 
perform the necessary computations at age-appropriate (not skill") 
level.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >4.</td>
<td>Utilize pick-the-correct-answer testing formats. <br><br> </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top rowspan=5>Organization</td>
<td valign=top >1.</td>
<td>Offer one small task at a time, or divide larger tasks into several mini-tasks.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >2.</td>
<td>As necessary, provide reminders to child of tasks; avoid nagging and 
avoid checklists.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >3.</td>
<td>Avoid punishment for "forgetting," not finishing, or being late with 
assignments or tasks.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign=top >4.</td>
<td>Provide the child with a pictorial system for self-reminding of tasks, chores, and events.</td>
</tr>
