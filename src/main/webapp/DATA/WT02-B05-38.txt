<CENTER>  <H3>Clinton Terrorism Legislation Threatens Constitutional Rights</H3></CENTER>
<p>
<p>   
On February 10, 1995, a counterterrorism bill drafted by the
Clinton Administration was introduced in the Senate as S. 390 and
in the House of Representatives as H.R. 896.
<p>
The Clinton bill is a mixture of: provisions eroding
constitutional and statutory due process protections, selective
federalization -- on political grounds -- of state crimes (minus
state due process rules), discredited ideas from the Reagan and
Bush Administrations, and the extension of some of the worst
elements of crime bills of the recent past.
<p>
The legislation would:
<p>
<ol>
<li>authorize the Justice Department to pick and choose
crimes to investigate and prosecute based on political beliefs
and associations;
<p>
<li>repeal the ancient provision barring the U.S. military
from civilian law enforcement;
<p>
<li>expand a pre-trial detention scheme that puts the burden
of proof on the accused;
<p>
<li>loosen the carefully-crafted rules governing federal
wiretaps, in violation of the Fourth Amendment;
<p>
<li>establish special courts that would use secret evidence
to order the deportation of persons convicted of no crimes, in
violation of basic principles of due process;
<p>
<li>permit permanent detention by the Attorney General of
aliens convicted of no crimes, with no judicial review;
<p>
<li>give the President unreviewable power to criminalize
fund-raising for lawful activities associated with unpopular
causes;
<p>
<li>renege on the Administration's approval in the last
Congress of a provision to insure that the FBI would not
investigate based on First Amendment activities; and
  <p>   
<li>resurrect the discredited ideological visa denial
provisions of the McCarran Walter Act to bar foreign speakers.
<p></ol>
Once again, the impatience of those charged with upholding
the Constitution has led them to seek authority to circumvent it.
<p>
The U.S. has not been a fertile breeding ground for
terrorism.  Part of the reason lies in the values at the core of
our unique system of governance -- diversity, religious and
ethnic tolerance, acceptance of change, openness to new ideas,
constitutional limits on government discretion, reliance on legal
proceedings open to public scrutiny.  These values make it hard
to nurture in the U.S. the ethnic or religious hatred that fuels
much terrorism.  Unfortunately, these values would be undermined
by this legislation. 
<p>
<b><ul>1. Use of Secret Evidence to Deport Aliens Not Charged with Criminal Activity</ul></b>
<p>
Title II is a slightly modified version of a proposal first
made during the Bush Administration, which Congress twice refused
to enact.  The changes made by the Clinton Administration do not
cure the essence of the proposal: it would create a special court
to hear secret evidence against aliens whom the government wishes
to deport.
<p>
It is important to recognize at the outset that the
provision applies only to aliens who are not charged with any
crime.  If any person found in this country was suspected of
committing a crime, especially a terrorist crime, that person
would be arrested and put on trial here or extradited to a
country where he could stand trial.  This provision is designed
to allow the government to deport persons who are deemed
undesirable because of their political associations and beliefs.
<p>
For the government to take adverse action against an
individual based on secret evidence is the antithesis of American
jurisprudence and a fundamental due process violation.
<p>
Aside from the Star Chamber concept that is at the core of
this provision, it has many other extraordinary features, among
them the following:  
<p>
<B>Use of Illegally Obtained Evidence. </B> The provision states:
"Nor shall such alien have the right to seek suppression of
evidence."  Repealing the exclusionary rule eviscerates the
Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and
seizure.
<p>
<B>Exemption from FISA Standards.</B>  The Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act has a meticulously crafted set of procedures
intended to balance the rights of individuals against the
national security.  Those procedures include a requirement that
the government give the defendant notice when it intends to use
information from a FISA wiretap and allow the defendant to move
to suppress the evidence if it was obtained illegally.  The bill
would make such provisions, which have worked fine in the most
serious espionage cases, inapplicable in alien deportation cases. 
<p>     
<B>Permanent detention</B>.  If no country is willing to receive an
alien ordered deported under the new provisions, the bill states
that "the Attorney General may, notwithstanding any other
provision of law, retain the alien in custody. ... Any alien in
custody pursuant to this subsection shall be released from
custody solely at the discretion of the Attorney General."
<p>
<B>Appeals only in D.C.. </B> In what appears to be either forum-
shopping or an effort to impose additional costs on aliens
fighting deportation, the bill would allow appeals from
deportation proceedings only to the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, forcing attorneys
from all over the country to come to Washington.
<p>
<B>Guilt by Association.  </B>The legislation subtly but critically
rewrites the definition of engaging in terrorist activity in the
Immigration and Nationality Act, which serves as the basis for
the exclusion of aliens seeking entry and the deportation of
aliens already in this country.
<p>
The current law defines "to engage in terrorist activity" to
cover someone who "affords material support to any individual,
organization, or government in conducting a terrorist activity."
The revised definition would read: "affords material support to
an individual, organization, or government which the actor knows
or reasonably should know has committed or plans to commit
terrorist activity."  The change would remove the current law's
requirement that there be a nexus between the material support
and the terrorist activity, thereby allowing exclusion and
deportation of any alien who had supported the peaceful, legal
activities of a group that engaged, or had subgroups that
engaged, in illegal acts.  The "has committed" language would
even seem to sweep in those who support groups that once
committed but have now foresworn terrorism.  
<p>
<B>Guilt by Association, Part II. </B> The bill would resurrect the
discredited ideological tests of the McCarran Walter Act for
denying foreign visitors visas to come to speak in the U.S. 
While the Immigration Act of 1990 authorized the denial of visas
to persons who had engaged in terrorist activities, this bill
would deny visas to all representatives or spokespersons for
groups labeled terrorist, even if the representative or
spokesperson had never engaged in any illegal activity.  This
test would have allowed the exclusion of representatives of the
African National Congress or the IRA or many other political
groups, even if they were seeking to enter the U.S. to talk about
prospects for peace.  
<p>     
<B>Continued Exclusion of PLO Representatives.</B>  Even after
Yassar Arafat has been received at the White House, where he
signed a peace accord with Israel, he and every other alien who
is a representative of the PLO is "considered, for purposes of
this Act, to be engaged in a terrorism activity." 
<p>
<B>Son of Star Chamber.</B>  Section 202(d) of the bill seems to
authorize a mini-Star Chamber proceeding, allowing the use of
classified information in any deportation case, even those where
the complex provisions of the alien terrorist removal section are
not invoked.
<p>
<b><ul>2.   Terrorist Fund-Raising Is Whatever the President
                 Decides It Is and Nobody Can Question His Decision</ul></b>
<p>
Title III of the bill creates a new federal crime of
"terrorist fund-raising."  The provision would allow the
President to define the crime by designating certain groups as
terrorist organizations.  The President can also designate
individual persons who are raising funds for, or acting for or on
behalf of, any organization he designates.  From then on, it is a
crime for "any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States anywhere, to directly or indirectly, raise, receive or
collect on behalf of, or furnish, give, transmit, transfer or
provide funds to or for an organization or person" so designated,
unless a license has been granted by the Secretary of the
Treasury. 
<p>
In an attempt to avoid judicial review of designations that
are either arbitrary or politically motivated, the legislation
states that the President's designation of a group or individual
would be final.  "Any finding made in any designation pursuant to
[this section] shall be conclusive.  No question concerning the
validity of the issuance of such designation may be raised by the
defendant in a criminal prosecution as a defense or as an
objection to any trial or hearing."  Introducing a further
opportunity for biased or inconsistent decisions, the legislation
allows the President to take an organization or person off the
list whenever he decides that "the national security, foreign
relations, or economic interests of the United States so
warrant," even though the organization is still involved in
terrorist activity.  
<p>
The new crime adopts by reference the definition of
terrorist activity in the Immigration and Nationality Act.  That
definition states that a terrorist organization means any
organization engaged, or which has a significant subgroup which
engages, in terrorism activity, regardless of any legitimate
activities conducted by the organization or its subgroups. 
<p>
The fundraising provisions are unconstitutional because they
violate the fundamental principle of our constitutional law that
"a blanket prohibition of association with a group having both
legal and illegal aims," without a showing of specific intent to
further the unlawful aims of the group, is an unconstitutional
infringement on "the cherished freedom of association protected
by the First Amendment."  Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11
(1966).  As the Supreme Court emphasized in Noto v. United
States, 364 U.S. 290, 299-300 (1961), "There is a danger that one
in sympathy with the legitimate aims of . . . an organization,
but not specifically intending to accomplish them by resort to
violence, might be punished for his adherence to lawful and
constitutionally protected purposes, because of other and
unprotected purposes which he does not necessarily share."   
<p>
     <ul><b>3.   A New Federal Crime of Terrorism to Be Applied
          Selectively Based on the Political Motivation of the
          Offender </ul></b>
<p>
Section 101 of the bill creates a new federal crime of
international terrorism in the United States.  Terrorist activity
should be a crime.  It already is a crime.  Section 101 does not
criminalize anything that is not already a crime.  The new
offense is defined as any killing, kidnapping, maiming, assault
resulting in serious bodily injury, or assault with a deadly
weapon, and any damage to any real or personal property "in
violation of the laws of any State or the United States," so long
as one of 9 jurisdictional bases is met.
<p>
Since the new offense does not cover anything that is not
already a crime, the main purpose of the proposal seems to be to
avoid certain constitutional and statutory protections that would
otherwise apply.  Investigations of, and prosecutions for, the
new crime would be subject to the following special rules:   
<p>
<B>Suspension of posse comitatus. </B> The new subsection (f)
provides a wholesale exemption from one of the oldest protections
in American law, the separation between military and police
functions.  At a time when there is growing public concern about
the militarization of law enforcement, subsection (f) provides
that "Assistance may be requested from any Federal ... agency,
including the Army, Navy and Air Force, any statute, rule or
regulation to the contrary notwithstanding."
<p>
<B>Avoiding state due process protections. </B> The federal rules
of criminal procedure are in certain respects outdated compared
to state court rules.  For example, many states have rejected the
concept of trial by surprise, adopting instead rules that require
the prosecution to disclose its evidence to the defense in
advance of trial, and vice versa.  This facilitates plea
bargaining and ensures that both sides are better prepared so the
trial, if there is one, runs more smoothly.  By contrast, under
federal law, a defense lawyer is entitled to see prior statements
made to police by a witness against his client only after the
witness testifies at trial.  There is increasing discussion of
modernizing this federal rule.  
<p>
In contrast to this trend, the draft adopts a tactic that
state and federal prosecutors have jointly pursued to circumvent
state procedural rules.  Subsection (g) provides that in any
prosecution under the section, "only the elements of state law,
and not any provisions pertaining to criminal procedure, are
adopted."  This allows state prosecutors, dissatisfied with the
rules of their own state, to take certain cases to federal
prosecutors in order to obtain the benefit of rules that make it
harder to mount an effective defense.   
<P>
<B>Chipping away at the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. </B> In
derogation of the Fifth Amendment's presumption of innocence and
the Sixth Amendment right to bail, Subsection 101(d) of this bill
provides that anyone accused of committing a crime thereunder is
presumed to be ineligible for bail and may be detained pretrial. 
The accused bears the burden of rebutting the presumption.  (This
is a significant expansion of a provision that first appeared in
1984, when Congress adopted 18 USC 3142(e), shifting to the
defendant in certain drug cases the burden of proving pretrial
that he is eligible for the constitutional right to bail.)   
<P>
<B> Loosening the rules on wiretaps.</B>  Subsection (e) would
exempt terrorism cases from the carefully crafted and balanced
standards developed in 1986 for so-called "roving taps."  When
Congress adopted the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of
1986, it struck a careful balance between privacy and law
enforcement.  Because of the Fourth Amendment's specificity
requirement, federal law has always required applicants for
wiretap orders to specify the location to be tapped.  Some
criminals were attempting to evade surveillance by using pay
phones, the location of which could not always be anticipated for
inclusion in the wiretap application.  Therefore, Congress in
1986 created a limited exception to the specificity requirement
where the target of an investigation has been taking steps to
thwart interception by changing facilities.  This bill would
dispense with that standard, allowing roving taps to be used
anytime a person is suspected of being involved in a terrorist
crime, regardless of the law's requirement that there be a basis
for the roving tap authority.  
<p>
<B>Mandatory jail sentence. </B> The new subsection 2332b(d) would
provide that no person convicted of a violation under the new
crime could be placed on probation.  While it is reasonable that
persons who commit violent crimes would be incarcerated, the new
section is not limited to violent offenses.  Someone who
intentionally scratches the car of a foreign diplomat would go to
jail if charged and convicted under this provision.  This gives
prosecutors, who decide whether to charge under this section or
another section, a tremendous club to hold over the heads of
minor offenders.
<p>
<B>Threats</B>   Under the proposed statute, threatening to do
anything violent is a crime itself.  There are numerous federal
threat statutes already on the books (bomb threats, threats
against the President), but there is no general threat statute. 
Under this bill, threatening to hit a tourist would be a federal
crime, which could be investigated and prosecuted without
adherence to constitutional and statutory protections.
<P>
<B>First Amendment dangers.</B>  It is unlikely, of course, that
ordinary crimes against tourists would be prosecuted under this
section.  The question of how cases will be selected for
investigation and prosecution under such a broad statute brings
us to the nub of the threat it poses.  Proposed new section
2332b(e) provides that no indictment could be brought unless the
Justice Department certifies that the offense appeared to have
been intended to intimidate or retaliate against a government or
population.  So the cases will be chosen based on the offender's
political motives, known or suspected.   
<P>
Selecting offenders for prosecution based on their politics
is fraught with danger to the First Amendment, especially where
ordinary constitutional and statutory guarantees are
circumvented.  The problem is further exacerbated here, where
motive is not an element of the crime to be proved at trial but
an unreviewable prosecutorial determination. 
<P>
Worse than the prosecutorial concerns are the investigative
implications of the legislation.  Encompassing as it does
attempts, threats and conspiracies, and read in conjunction with
the extraterritorial provisions in sections 102 and 103 and the
fund-raising provisions in Title III, this legislation is a
general charter for the FBI to investigate political groups and
causes at will.  
<p>
Indeed, the Administration is quite explicit about its
intention to investigate based on First Amendment activities.  In
section 601 of the bill, it seeks to repeal a seemingly modest
provision (the "Edwards amendment") agreed to by the
Administration only 6 months ago and enacted in last year's crime
bill that prohibited investigations of "material support" based
on activities protected by the First Amendment.  The
Administration now claims that this provision imposes "an
unprecedented and impractical burden on law enforcement
concerning the initiation and continuation of criminal
investigations" and asks for its repeal.  The amendment in fact
was intended to merely codify the criminal standard in the Smith
guidelines.
<p>  
<B>Equal protection violation. </B> One of the jurisdictional bases
set forth in the new provision is that any alleged offender is an
alien.  While the federal government has broader discretion than
the states in making distinctions between citizens and aliens,
providing different crimes for aliens and citizens would surely
seem to violate the Constitution.
