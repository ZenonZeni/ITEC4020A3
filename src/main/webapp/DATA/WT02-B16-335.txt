<h2>EVALUATION OF APPLICATIONS</h2>
<p>
<b>Initial Screening</b>
<p>
After receiving the application, a preliminary review will be performed 
by DOE to check for completeness.  Applications that are clearly 
non-responsive, e.g., do not address all of the evaluation criteria, or 
are substantially deficient in detail to permit a complete evaluation, 
will not be comprehensively evaluated or considered for award.
<p>
<b>Comprehensive Evaluation</b>
<p>
Evaluation of applications will be performed using the evaluation 
criteria indicated below.  In evaluating applications, DOE reserves the 
right to use any assistance deemed advisable, in accordance with 
applicable regulations, including qualified personnel from other Federal 
agencies, other government entities, universities, industry, and DOE 
contractors.  These individuals will be required to protect the 
confidentiality of any specifically identified trade secrets and/or 
privileged or confidential commercial or financial information obtained 
as a result of their participation in this evaluation.  Submittal of an 
application under this solicitation constitutes consent to use outside 
evaluators.  Information contained in the application shall be treated in 
accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in 10 CFR Part 
600.15.
<p>
In addition to the evaluation criteria, DOE will also consider other 
factors in making selections for awards as discussed in the section of 
this solicitation titled "Program Policy Factors."
