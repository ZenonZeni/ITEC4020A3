<H2>Trade Wind</H2>
<br>
A steady wind that blows westward and toward the equator from the 
<br>
high pressure belts near 30 degrees North and South Latitude.
<br>
The winds were named by crews of sailing ships that depended on them
<br>
during westward ocean crossings.

The trade winds are controlled by ties between the atmosphere and the ocean, especially sea surface temperature.  During an El Nino year, the winds that usually blow steadily towards the west weaken and even reverse direction.  The figure below shows how winds in the western Pacific Ocean, near the island of New Guinea, reversed their direction between April and October, 1994.  With weakened trade winds, the huge mass of warm water usually found in the western Pacific moves eastward.  As it does so, it sends a pulse called a <a href=kel_ross.html>Kelvin wave</a> along the equator.  This long wave moves eastward toward the west coast of South America, where it thickens the warm, upper ocean layer and causes sea level to rise.  The thickened warm water layer prevents upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water that fish thrive upon.
