<font SIZE=+2>INDOOR AIR QUALITY CONCERNS</font> 
<p>All of us face a variety of risks to our health as we go about our day-to-day
lives. Driving in cars, flying in planes, engaging in recreational activities,
and being exposed to environmental pollutants all pose varying degrees
of risk. Some risks are simply unavoidable. Some we choose to accept because
to do otherwise would restrict our ability to lead our lives the way we
want. And some are risks we might decide to avoid if we had the opportunity
to make informed choices. Indoor air pollution is one risk that you can
do something about.</p>

<p>In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has
indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously
polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized
cities. Other research indicates that people spend approximately 90 percent
of their time indoors. Thus, for many people, the risks to health may be
greater due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors. In addition,
people who may be exposed to indoor air pollutants for the longest periods
of time are often those most susceptible to the effects of indoor air pollution.
Such groups include the young, the elderly, and the chronically ill, especially
those suffering from respiratory or cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>

<p>WHY A BOOKLET ON INDOOR AIR?</p>

<p>While pollutant levels from in-dividual sour-ces may not pose a significant
health risk by themselves, most homes have more than one source that contributes
to indoor air pollution. There can be a serious risk from the cumulative
effects of these sources. Fortunately, there are steps that most people
can take both to reduce the risk from existing sources and to prevent new
problems from occurring. This booklet was prepared by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC) to help you decide whether to take actions that can reduce the level
of indoor air pollution in your own home. Because so many Americans spend
a lot of time in offices with mechanical heating, cooling, and ventilation
systems, there is also a short section on the causes of poor air quality
in offices and what you can do if you suspect that your office may have
a problem. A glossary and a list of organizations where you can get additional
information are listed at the back of this booklet.</p>

<p>WHAT CAUSES INDOOR AIR PROBLEMS?</p>

<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air
are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate
ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough
outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying
indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels
can also increase concentrations of some pollutants.</p>

<p>Pollutant Sources</p>

<p>There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home. These include
combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, wood, and tobacco
products; building materials and furnishings as diverse as deteriorated,
asbestos-containing insulation, wet or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furniture
made of certain pressed wood products; products for household cleaning
and maintenance, personal care, or hobbies; central heating and cooling
systems and humidification devices; and outdoor sources such as radon,
pesticides, and outdoor air pollution. The relative importance of any single
source depends on how much of a given pollutant it emits and how hazardous
those emissions are. In some cases, factors such as how old the source
is and whether it is properly maintained are significant. For example,
an improperly adjusted gas stove can emit significantly more carbon monoxide
than one that is properly adjusted. Some sources, such as building materials,
furnishings, and household products like air fresh-eners, release pollutants
more or less continuously. Other sources, related to activities carried
out in the home, release pollutants intermittently. These include smoking,
the use of unvented or malfunctioning stoves, furnaces, or space heaters,
the use of solvents in cleaning and hobby activities, the use of paint
strippers in redecorating activities, and the use of cleaning products
and pesticides in house-keeping. High pollutant concentrations can remain
in the air for long periods after some of these activities.</p>

<p>Amount of Ventilation </p>

<p>If too little outdoor air enters a home, pollutants can accumulate to
levels that can pose health and comfort problems. Unless they are built
with special mechanical means of ventilation, homes that are designed and
constructed to minimize the amount of outdoor air that can leaky.</p>

<p>HOW DOES OUTDOOR AIR ENTER A HOUSE?</p>

<p>Outdoor air enters and leaves a house by: infiltration, natural ventilation,
and mechanical ventilation. In a process known as infiltration, outdoor
air flows into the house through openings, joints, and cracks in walls,
floors, and ceilings, and around windows and doors. In natural ventilation,
air moves through opened windows and doors. Air movement associated with
infiltration and natural ventilation is caused by air temperature differences
between indoors and outdoors and by wind. Finally, there are a number of
mechanical ventilation devices, from outdoor-vented fans that intermittently
remove air from a single room, such as bathrooms and kitchen, to air handling
systems that use fans and duct work to continuously remove indoor air and
distribute filtered and conditioned outdoor air to strategic points throughout
the house. The rate at which outdoor air replaces indoor air is described
as the air exchange rate. When there is little infiltration, natural ventilation,
or mechanical ventilation, the air exchange rate is low and pollutant levels
can increase.</p>

<p>WHAT IF YOU LIVE IN AN APARTMENT?</p>

<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air problems as single-family homes
because many of the pollution sources, such as the interior building materials,
furnishings, and household products, are similar. Indoor air problems similar
to those in offices are caused by such sources as contaminated ventilation
systems, improperly placed outdoor air intakes, or maintenance activities.
Solutions to air quality problems in apartments, as in homes and offices,
involve such actions as: eliminating or controlling the sources of pollution,
increasing ventilation, and installing air cleaning devices. Often a resident
can take the appropriate action to improve the indoor air quality by removing
a source, altering an activity, unblocking an air supply vent, or opening
a window to temporarily increase the ventilation; in other cases, however,
only the building owner or manager is in a position to remedy the problem.
(See the section &quot;What to Do If You Suspect a Problem&quot; on page
30.) You can encourage building management to follow guidance in EPA and
NIOSH's Building Air Quality: A Guide for Building Owners and Facility
Managers. It is available for $24 from the Superintendent of Documents,

<p>INDOOR AIR AND YOUR HEALTH</p>

<p>Health effects from indoor air pollutants may be experienced soon after
exposure or, possibly, years later. Immediate effects may show up after
a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include irritation of the
eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. Such immediate
effects are usually short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is
simply eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution,
if it can be identified. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, may also show up soon after exposure
to some indoor air pollutants. The likelihood of immediate reactions to
indoor air pollutants depends on several factors. Age and preexisting medical
conditions are two important influences. In other cases, whether a person
reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity, which varies tremendous-ly
from person to person. Some people can become sensitized to biological
pollutants after repeated exposures, and it appears that some people can
become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well. Certain immediate effects
are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often
difficult to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor
air pollution. For this reason, it is important to pay attention to the
time and place the symptoms occur. If the symptoms fade or go away when
a person is away from the home and return when the person returns, an effort
should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes.
Some effects may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or
from the heating, cooling, or humidity conditions prevalent in the home.
Other health effects may show up either years after exposure has occurred
or only after long or repeated periods of exposure. These effects, which
include some respiratory diseases, heart disease, and cancer, can be severely
debilitating or fatal. It is prudent to try to improve the indoor air quality
in your home even if symptoms are not noticeable. More information on potential
health effects from particular indoor air pollutants is provided in the
section, &quot;A Look at Source-Specific Controls.&quot; While pollutants
commonly found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful effects,
there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods
of exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems. People also
react very differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Further research
is needed to better understand which health effects occur after exposure
to the average pollutant concentrations found in homes and which occur
from the higher concentrations that occur for short periods of time. The
health effects associated with some indoor air pollutants are summarized
in the chart in the middle of this booklet titled &quot;Reference Guide
to Major Indoor Air Pollutants in the Home.&quot; </p>

<p>IDENTIFYING AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS</p>

<p>Some health effects can be useful indicators of an indoor air quality
problem, especially if they appear after a person moves to a new residence,
remodels or refurnishes a home, or treats a home with pesticides. If you
think that you have symptoms that may be related to your home environment,
discuss them with your doctor or your local health department to see if
they could be caused by indoor air pollution. You may also want to consult
a board-certified allergist or an occupational medicine specialist for
answers to your questions. Another way to judge whether your home has or
could develop indoor air problems is to identify potential sources of indoor
air pollution. Although the presence of such sources (see illustration
at the beginning of this booklet) does not necessarily mean that you have
an indoor air quality problem, being aware of the type and number of potential
sources is an important step toward assessing the air quality in your home.
A third way to decide whether your home may have poor indoor air quality
is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be significant
sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, look for signs of problems with
the ventilation in your home. Signs that can indicate your home may not
have enough ventilation include moisture condensation on windows or walls,
smelly or stuffy air, dirty central heating and air cooling equipment,
and areas where books, shoes, or other items become moldy. To detect odors
in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and then upon reentering
your home, note whether odors are noticeable.</p>

<p>MEASURING POLLUTANT LEVELS</p>

<p>T he federal government recommends that you measure the level of radon
in your home. Without measurements there is no way to tell whether radon
is present because it is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Inexpensive
devices are available for measuring radon. EPA provides guidance as to
risks associated with different levels of exposure and when the public
should consider corrective action. There are specific mitigation techniques
that have proven effective in reducing levels of radon in the home. (See
&quot;Radon&quot; section on p. 11 of this booklet for additional information
about testing and controlling radon in homes.) For pollutants other than
radon, measurements are most appropriate when there are either health symptoms
or signs of poor ventilation and specific sources or pollutants have been
identified as possible causes of indoor air quality problems. Testing for
many pollutants can be expensive. Before monitoring your home for pollutants
besides radon, consult your state or local health department or professionals
who have experience in solving indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial
buildings.</p>

<p>WEATHERIZING YOUR HOME</p>

<p>The federal government recommends that homes be weatherized in order
to reduce the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization
is underway, however, steps should also be taken to minimize pollution
from sources inside the home. (See &quot;Improving the Air Quality in Your
Home&quot; for recommended actions.) In addition, residents should be alert
to the emergence of signs of inadequate ventilation, such as stuffy air,
moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew growth. Additional
weatherization measures should not be undertaken until these problems have
been corrected. Weatherization generally does not cause indoor air problems
by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such
as caulking, that can sometimes emit pollutants.) However, measures such
as installing storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in
wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into
a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air
pollutants from sources inside the home can increase. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>THREE BASIC STRATEGIES</p>

<p>1) Source Control</p>

<p>Usually the most effective way to improve indoor air quality is to eliminate
individual sources of pollution or to reduce their emissions. Some sources,
like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like
gas stoves, can be adjusted to decrease the amount of emissions. In many
cases, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to protecting
indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation
can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in
your home are listed later in this section.</p>

<p>2) Ventilation Improvements</p>

<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants
in your home is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Most
home heating and cooling systems, including forced air heating systems,
do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening windows and
doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running
a window air conditioner with the vent control open increases the outdoor
ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors
remove contaminants directly from the room where the fan is located and
also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate. It is particularly important
to take as many of these steps as possible while you are involved in short-term
activities that can generate high levels of pollutants--for example, painting,
paint stripping, heating with kerosene heaters, cooking, or engaging in
maintenance and hobby activities such as welding, soldering, or sanding.
You might also choose to do some of these activities outdoors, if you can
and if weather permits. Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature
mechanical systems that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these
designs include energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (also known
as air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat
exchangers, contact the Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral
Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.</p>

<p>3) Air Cleaners</p>

<p>There are many types and sizes of air cleaners on the market, ranging
from relatively inexpensive table-top models to sophisticated and expensive
whole-house systems. Some air cleaners are highly effective at particle
removal, while others, including most table-top models, are much less so.
Air cleaners are generally not designed to remove gaseous pollutants. The
effectiveness of an air cleaner depends on how well it collects pollutants
from indoor air (expressed as a percentage efficiency rate) and how much
air it draws through the cleaning or filtering element (expressed in cubic
feet per minute). A very efficient collector with a low air-circulation
rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation
rate but a less efficient collector. </p>

<p>The long-term performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining
it according to the manufacturer's directions. Another important factor
in determining the effectiveness of an air cleaner is the strength of the
pollutant source. Table-top air cleaners, in particular, may not remove
satisfactory amounts of pollutants from strong nearby sources. People with
a sensitivity to particular sources may find that air cleaners are helpful
only in conjunction with concerted efforts to remove the source. </p>

<p>Over the past few years, there has been some publicity suggesting that
houseplants have been shown to reduce levels of some chemicals in laboratory
experiments. There is currently no evidence, however, that a reasonable
number of houseplants remove significant quantities of pollutants in homes
and offices. Indoor houseplants should not be over-watered because overly
damp soil may promote the growth of microorganisms which can affect allergic
individuals. </p>

<p>At present, EPA does not recommend using air cleaners to reduce levels
of <b>radon</b> and its decay products. The effectiveness of these devices
is uncertain because they only partially remove the radon decay products
and do not diminish the amount of radon entering the home. EPA plans to
do additional research on whether air cleaners are, or could become, a
reliable means of reducing the health risk from radon. EPA's booklet, Residential
Air-Cleaning Devices, provides further information on air-cleaning devices
to reduce indoor air pollutants. For most indoor air quality problems in
the home, source control is the most effective solution. This section takes
a source-by-source look at the most common indoor air pollutants, their
potential health effects, and ways to reduce levels in the home. (For a
summary of the points made in this section, see the chart in the middle
of this booklet titled &quot;Reference Guide to Major Indoor Air Pollutants
in the Home.&quot;)</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>RADON</p>

<p>The most common source of indoor radon is uranium in the soil or rock
on which homes are built. As uran-ium naturally breaks down, it releases
radon gas which is a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas. Radon gas enters
homes through dirt floors, cracks in concrete walls and floors, floor drains,
and sumps. When radon be-comes trapped in buildings and concentrations
build up indoors, exposure to radon becomes a concern. Any home may have
a radon problem. This means new and old homes, well-sealed and drafty homes,
and homes with or without basements. Sometimes radon enters the home through
well water. In a small number of homes, the building materials can give
off radon, too. However, building materials rarely cause radon problems
by themselves.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Radon</p>

<p>The predominant health effect associated with exposure to elevated levels
of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high
radon levels may pose risks, too, although these are believed to be much
lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health organizations
(like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Lung
Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates
that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year.
EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United
States--however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per
year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your risk of lung
cancer is especially high. Reducing Exposure to Radon in Homes Measure
levels of radon in your home. You can't see radon, but it's not hard to
find out if you have a radon problem in your home. Testing is easy and
should only take a little of your time. There are many kinds of inexpensive,
do-it-yourself radon test kits you can get through the mail and in hardware
stores and other retail outlets. Make sure you buy a test kit that has
passed EPA's testing program or is state-certified. These kits will usually
display the phrase &quot;Meets EPA Requirements.&quot; If you prefer, or
if you are buying or selling a home, you can hire a trained contractor
to do the testing for you. The EPA Radon Measurement Proficiency (RMP)
Program evaluates testing contractors. A contractor who has met EPA's requirements
will carry a special RMP identification card. EPA provides a list of companies
and indivi-dual contractors to state radon offices. You can call your state
radon office to obtain a list of qualified contractors in your area (call
800-SOS RADON for a list of state radon offices). </p>

<p>1) Refer to the EPA guidelines on how to test and interpret your test
results.</p>

<p>You can learn more about radon through EPA's publications, A Citizen's
Guide to Radon: The Guide to Protecting Yourself and Your Family From Radon
and Home Buyer's and Seller's Guide to Radon, which are available from
state radon offices.</p>

<p>2) Learn about radon reduction methods.</p>

<p>Ways to reduce radon in your home are discussed in EPA's Consumer's
Guide to Radon Reduction. You can get a copy from your state radon office.
There are simple solutions to radon problems in homes. Thousands of homeowners
have already fixed radon problems. Lowering high radon levels requires
technical knowledge and special skills. You should use a contractor who
is trained to fix radon problems. The EPA Radon Contractor Proficiency
(RCP) Program tests these contractors. EPA provides a list of RCP contractors
to state radon offices. A contractor who is listed by EPA will carry a
special RCP identification card. A trained RCP contractor can study the
problem in your home and help you pick the correct treatment method. Check
with your state radon office for names of qualified or state-certified
radon-reduction contractors in your area. </p>

<p>3) Stop smoking and discourage smoking in your home.</p>

<p>Scientific evidence indicates that smoking combined with radon is an
especially serious health risk. Stop smoking and lower your radon level
to reduce lung cancer risk</p>

<p>4) Treat radon-contaminated well water.</p>

<p>While radon in water is not a problem in homes served by most public
water supplies, it has been found in well water. If you've tested the air
in your home and found a radon problem, and you have a well, contact a
lab certified to measure radiation in water to have your water tested.
Radon problems in water can be readily fixed. Call your state radon office
or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.</p>

<p>ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE</p>

<p>Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is the mixture of smoke that comes
from the burning end of a cigarette, pipe, or cigar, and smoke exhaled
by the smoker. It is a complex mixture of over 4,000 compounds, more than
40 of which are known to cause cancer in humans or animals and many of
which are strong irritants. ETS is often referred to as &quot;secondhand
smoke&quot; and exposure to ETS is often called &quot;passive smoking.&quot;
</p>

<p>Health Effects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke</p>

<p>In 1992, EPA completed a major assessment of the respiratory health
risks of ETS (Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking: Lung Cancer
and Other Disorders EPA/600/6-90/006F). The report concludes that exposure
to ETS is responsible for approximately 3,000 lung cancer deaths each year
in nonsmoking adults and impairs the respiratory health of hundreds of
thousands of children. Infants and young children whose parents smoke in
their presence are at increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections
(pneumonia and bronchitis) and are more likely to have symptoms of respiratory
irritation like cough, excess phlegm, and wheeze. EPA estimates that passive
smoking annually causes between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract
infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in
between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year. These children may
also have a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, which can lead to ear
infections. Older children who have been exposed to secondhand smoke may
have slightly reduced lung function. Asthmatic children are especially
at risk. EPA estimates that exposure to secondhand smoke increases the
number of episodes and severity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of
asthmatic children, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic children to
develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000
asthmatic children have their condition made worse by exposure to secondhand
smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke causes eye, nose, and throat
irritation. It may affect the cardiovascular system and some studies have
linked exposure to secondhand smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications
about ETS, contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Information Clearinghouse (IAQ
INFO), 800-438-4318 or (202) 484-1307.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke</p>

<p>1) Don't smoke at home or permit others to do so.</p>

<p>Ask smokers to smoke outdoors. The 1986 Surgeon General's report concluded
that physical separation of smokers and nonsmokers in a common air space,
such as different rooms within the same house, may reduce_but will not
eliminate_non-smokers' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>2) If smoking indoors cannot be avoided, increase ventilation in the
area where smoking takes place. </p>

<p>Open windows or use exhaust fans. Ventilation, a common method of reducing
exposure to indoor air pollutants, also will reduce but not eliminate exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke. Because smoking produces such large amounts
of pollutants, natural or mechanical ventilation techniques do not remove
them from the air in your home as quickly as they build up. In addition,
the large increases in ventilation it takes to significantly reduce exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs substantially.
Consequently, the most effective way to reduce exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke in the home is to eliminate smoking there. </p>

<p>3) Do not smoke if children are present, particularly infants and toddlers.</p>

<p>Children are particularly susceptible to the effects of passive smoking.
Do not allow baby-sitters or others who work in your home to smoke indoors.
Discourage others from smoking around children. Find out about the smoking
policies of the day care center providers, schools, and other care givers
for your children. The policy should protect children from exposure to
ETS.</p>

<p>BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS</p>

<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal
dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There
are many sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; viruses
are transmitted by people and animals; bacteria are carried by people,
animals, and soil and plant debris; and household pets are sources of saliva
and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent
allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Contaminated central air
handling systems can become breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other
sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these contaminants
through the home. By controlling the relative humidity level in a home,
the growth of some sources of biologicals can be minimized. A relative
humidity of 30-50 percent is generally recommended for homes. Standing
water, water-damaged materials, or wet surfaces also serve as a breeding
ground for molds, mildews, bacteria, and insects. House dust mites, the
source of one of the most powerful biological allergens, grow in damp,
warm environments.</p>

<p>Health Effects From Biological Contaminants</p>

<p>Some biological contaminants trigger allergic reactions, including hypersensitivity
pneumonitis, allergic rhinitis, and some types of asthma. Infectious illnesses,
such as influenza, measles, and chicken pox are transmitted through the
air. Molds and mildews release disease-causing toxins. Symptoms of health
problems caused by biological pollutants include sneezing, watery eyes,
coughing, shortness of breath, dizziness, lethargy, fever, and digestive
problems. Allergic reactions occur only after repeated exposure to a specific
biological allergen. However, that reaction may occur immediately upon
re-exposure or after multiple exposures over time. As a result, people
who have noticed only mild allergic reactions, or no reactions at all,
may suddenly find themselves very sensitive to particular allergens. Some
diseases, like humidifier fever, are associated with exposure to toxins
from microorganisms that can grow in large building ventilation systems.
However, these diseases can also be traced to microorganisms that grow
in home heating and cooling systems and humidifiers. Children, elderly
people, and people with breathing problems, allergies, and lung diseases
are particularly susceptible to disease-causing biological agents in the
indoor air.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Biological Contaminants</p>

<p>1) Install and use exhaust fans that are vented to the outdoors in kitchens
and bathrooms and vent clothes dryers outdoors.</p>

<p>These actions can eliminate much of the moisture that builds up from
everyday activities. There are exhaust fans on the market that produce
little noise, an important consideration for some people. Another benefit
to using kitchen and bathroom exhaust fans is that they can reduce levels
of organic pollutants that vaporize from hot water used in showers and
dishwashers.</p>

<p>2) Ventilate the attic and crawl spaces to prevent moisture build-up.</p>

<p>Keeping humidity levels in these areas below 50 percent can prevent
water condensation on building materials.</p>

<p>3) If using cool mist or ultrasonic humidifiers, clean appliances according
to manufacturer's instructions and refill with fresh water daily.</p>

<p>Because these humidifiers can become breeding grounds for biological
contaminants, they have the potential for causing diseases such as hypersensitivity
pneumonitis and humidifier fever. Evaporation trays in air conditioners,
dehumidifiers, and refrigera- tors should also be cleaned frequently.</p>

<p>4) Thoroughly clean and dry water-damaged carpets and building materials
(within 24 hours if possible) or consider removal and replacement.</p>

<p>Water-damaged carpets and building materials can harbor mold and bacteria.
It is very difficult to completely rid such materials of biological contaminants.</p>

<p>5) Keep the house clean.</p>

<p>House dust mites, pollens, animal dander, and other allergy-causing
agents can be reduced, although not eliminated, through regular cleaning.
People who are allergic to these pollutants should use allergen-proof mattress
encasements, wash bedding in hot (130_F) water, and avoid room furnishings
that accumulate dust, especially if they cannot be washed in hot water.
Allergic individuals should also leave the house while it is being vacuumed
because vacuuming can actually increase airborne levels of mite allergens
and other biological contaminants. Using central vacuum systems that are
vented to the outdoors or vacuums with high efficiency filters may also
be of help.</p>

<p>6) Take steps to minimize biological pollutants in basements.</p>

<p>Clean and disinfect the basement floor drain regularly. Do not finish
a basement below ground level unless all water leaks are patched and outdoor
ventilation and adequate heat to prevent condensation are provided. Operate
a dehumidifier in the basement if needed to keep relative humidity levels
between 30_50 percent. To learn more about biological pollutants, read
Biological Pollutants in Your Home issued by the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission and the American Lung Assoc-iation. For contact information,
see the section, &quot;Where to Go For Additional Information.&quot;</p>

<p>STOVES, HEATERS, FIREPLACES, AND CHIMNEYS</p>

<p>In addition to environmental tobacco smoke, other sources of combustion
products are unvented kerosene and gas space heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces,
and gas stoves. The major pollutants released are carbon monoxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and particles. Unvented kerosene heaters may also generate acid
aerosols. Combustion gases and particles also come from chimneys and flues
that are improperly installed or maintained and cracked furnace heat exchangers.
Pollutants from fireplaces and woodstoves with no dedicated outdoor air
supply can be &quot;back-drafted&quot; from the chimney into the living
space, particularly in weatherized homes.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Combustion Products</p>

<p>Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that interferes with the
delivery of oxygen throughout the body. At high concentrations it can cause
unconsciousness and death. Lower concentrations can cause a range of symptoms
from headaches, dizziness, weakness, nausea, confusion, and disorientation,
to fatigue in healthy people and episodes of increased chest pain in people
with chronic heart disease. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are
sometimes confused with the flu or food poisoning. Fetuses, infants, elderly
people, and people with anemia or with a history of heart or respiratory
disease can be especially sensitive to carbon monoxide exposures. Nitrogen
dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes
in the eye, nose, and throat and causes shortness of breath after exposure
to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued
exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of respiratory
infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated exposures
to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development
of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular risk from exposure
to nitrogen dioxide include children and individuals with asthma and other
respiratory diseases. Particles, released when fuels are incompletely burned,
can lodge in the lungs and irritate or damage lung tissue. A number of
pollutants, including radon and benzo(a)py-rene, both of which can cause
cancer, attach to small particles that are inhaled and then carried deep
into the lung.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Combustion Products in Homes</p>

<p>1) Take special precautions when operating fuel-burning unvented space
heaters. </p>

<p>Consider potential effects of indoor air pollution if you use an unvented
kerosene or gas space heater. Follow the manufacturer's directions, especially
instructions on the proper fuel and keeping the heater properly adjusted.
A persistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment
and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heater is in use, open
a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the house
and open a window slightly. </p>

<p>2) Install and use exhaust fans over gas cooking stoves and ranges and
keep the burners properly adjusted.</p>

<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors greatly reduces
exposure to pollutants during cooking. Improper adjustment, often indicated
by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, causes increased pollutant emissions.
Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue.
If you purchase a new gas stove or range, consider buying one with pilotless
ignition because it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously.
Never use a gas stove to heat your home. Always make certain the flue in
your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.</p>

<p>3) Keep woodstove emissions to a minimum.</p>

<p>Choose properly sized new stoves that are certified as meeting EPA emission
standards. Make certain that doors in old woodstoves are tight-fitting.
Use aged or cured (dried) wood only and follow the manufacturer's directions
for starting, stoking, and putting out the fire in woodstoves. Chemicals
are used to pressure-treat wood; such wood should never be burned indoors.
(Because some old gaskets in woodstove doors contain asbestos, when replacing
gaskets refer to the instructions in the CPSC, ALA, and EPA booklet, Asbestos
in Your Home, to avoid creating an asbestos problem. New gaskets are made
of fiberglass.) </p>

<p>4) Have central air handling systems, including furnaces, flues, and
chimneys, inspected annually and promptly repair cracks or damaged parts.
</p>

<p>Blocked, leaking, or damaged chimneys or flues release harmful combustion
gases and particles and even fatal concentrations of carbon monoxide. Strictly
follow all service and maintenance procedures recommended by the manufacturer,
including those that tell you how frequently to change the filter. If manufacturer's
instructions are not readily available, change filters once every month
or two during periods of use. Proper maintenance is important even for
new furnaces because they can also corrode and leak combustion gases, including
carbon monoxide. Read the booklet What You Should Know About Combustion
Appliances and Indoor Air Pollution to learn more about combustion pollutants.
The booklet is available by contacting CPSC, EPA's IAQ INFO Clearinghouse,
or your local ALA. (See &quot;Where to Go for Additional Information&quot;
for contact information.) </p>

<p>HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS</p>

<p>Organic chemicals are widely used as ingredients in household products.
Paints, varnishes, and wax all contain organic solvents, as do many cleaning,
disinfecting, cosmetic, degreasing, and hobby products. Fuels are made
up of organic chemicals. All of these products can release organic compounds
while you are using them, and, to some degree, when they are stored. EPA's
Total Exposure Assessment Methodology (TEAM) studies found levels of about
a dozen common organic pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes
than outside, regardless of whether the homes were located in rural or
highly industrial areas. Additional TEAM studies indicate that while people
are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves
and others to very high pollutant levels, and elevated concentrations can
persist in the air long after the activity is completed.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Household Chemicals</p>

<p>The ability of organic chemicals to cause health effects varies greatly
from those that are highly toxic, to those with no known health effect.
As with other pollutants, the extent and nature of the health effect will
depend on many factors including level of exposure and length of time exposed.
Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders,
and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some people
have experienced soon after exposure to some organics. At present, not
much is known about what health effects occur from the levels of organics
usually found in homes. Many organic compounds are known to cause cancer
in animals; some are suspected of causing, or are known to cause, cancer
in humans. </p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Household Chemicals </p>

<p>1) Follow label instructions carefully.</p>

<p>Potentially hazardous products often have warnings aimed at reducing
exposure of the user. For example, if a label says to use the product in
a well-ventilated area, go outdoors or in areas equipped with an exhaust
fan to use it. Otherwise, open up windows to provide the maximum amount
of outdoor air possible.</p>

<p>2) Throw away partially full containers of old or unneeded chemicals
safely. </p>

<p>Because gases can leak even from closed containers, this single step
could help lower concentrations of organic chemicals in your home. (Be
sure that materials you decide to keep are stored not only in a well-ventilated
area but are also safely out of reach of children.) Do not simply toss
these unwanted products in the garbage can. Find out if your local government
or any organization in your community sponsors special days for the collection
of toxic household wastes. If such days are available, use them to dispose
of the unwanted containers safely. If no such collection days are available,
think about organizing one.</p>

<p>3) Buy limited quantities.</p>

<p>If you use products only occasionally or seasonally, such as paints,
paint strippers, and kerosene for space heaters or gasoline for lawn mowers,
buy only as much as you will use right away.</p>

<p>4) Keep exposure to emissions from products containing methylene chloride
to a minimum.</p>

<p>Consumer products that contain methylene chloride include paint strippers,
adhesive removers, and aerosol spray paints. Methylene chloride is known
to cause cancer in animals. Also, methylene chloride is converted to carbon
monoxide in the body and can cause symptoms associated with exposure to
carbon monoxide. Carefully read the labels containing health hazard information
and cautions on the proper use of these products. Use products that contain
methylene chloride outdoors when possible; use indoors only if the area
is well ventilated.</p>

<p>5) Keep exposure to benzene to a minimum. </p>

<p>Benzene is a known human carcinogen. The main indoor sources of this
chemical are environmental tobacco smoke, stored fuels and paint supplies,
and automobile emissions in attached garages. Actions that will reduce
benzene exposure include eliminating smoking within the home, providing
for maximum ventilation during painting, and discarding paint supplies
and special fuels that will not be used immediately.</p>

<p>6) Keep exposure to perchloroethylene emissions from newly dry-cleaned
materials to a minimum. </p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely used in dry cleaning.
In laboratory studies, it has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Recent
studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in
homes where dry-cleaned goods are stored and as they wear dry-cleaned clothing.
Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process
so they can save money by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical
during the pressing and finishing processes. Some dry cleaners, however,
do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking
steps to minimize your exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned
goods have a strong chemical odor when you pick them up, do not accept
them until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor
are returned to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.
</p>

<p>FORMALDEHYDE</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is an important chemical used widely by industry to manufacture
building materials and numerous household products. It is also a by-product
of combustion and certain other natural processes. Thus, it may be present
in substantial concentrations both indoors and outdoors. Sources of formaldehyde
in the home include building materials, smoking, household products, and
the use of unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene
space heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals,
serves a number of purposes in manufactured products. For example, it is
used to add permanent-press qualities to clothing and draperies, as a component
of glues and adhesives, and as a preservative in some paints and coating
products. In homes, the most significant sources of formaldehyde are likely
to be pressed wood products made using adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde
(UF) resins. Pressed wood products made for indoor use include: particleboard
(used as subflooring and shelving and in cabinetry and furniture); hardwood
plywood paneling (used for decorative wall covering and used in cabinets
and furniture); and medium density fiberboard (used for drawer fronts,
cabinets, and furniture tops). Medium density fiberboard contains a higher
resin-to-wood ratio than any other UF pressed wood product and is generally
recognized as being the highest formaldehyde-emitting pressed wood product.
Other pressed wood products, such as softwood plywood and flake or oriented
strandboard, are produced for exterior construction use and contain the
dark, or red/black-colored phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resin. Although formaldehyde
is present in both types of resins, pressed woods that contain PF resin
generally emit formaldehyde at considerably lower rates than those containing
UF resin.</p>

<p>Since 1985, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has
permitted only the use of plywood and particleboard that conform to specified
formaldehyde emission limits in the construction of prefabricated and mobile
homes. In the past, some of these homes had elevated levels of formaldehyde
because of the large amount of high-emitting pressed wood products used
in their construction and because of their relatively small interior space.
The rate at which products like pressed wood or textiles release formaldehyde
can change. Formaldehyde emissions will generally decrease as products
age. When the products are new, high indoor temperatures or humidity can
cause increased release of formaldehyde from these products. During the
1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed
in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation measure.
However, many of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor
concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few homes
are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde
emissions from UFFI decline with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was
installed many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde
now.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Formaldehyde</p>

<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can cause watery eyes,
burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing
in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million).
High concentrations may trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is
evidence that some people can develop a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It
has also been shown to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in
humans. Reducing Exposure to Formaldehyde in Homes Ask about the formaldehyde
content of pressed wood products, including building materials, cabinetry,
and furniture before you purchase them. If you experience adverse reactions
to formaldehyde, you may want to avoid the use of pressed wood products
and other formaldehyde-emitting goods. Even if you do not experience such
reactions, you may wish to reduce your exposure as much as possible by
purchasing exterior-grade products, which emit less formaldehyde. For further
information on formaldehyde and consumer products, call the EPA Toxic Substance
Control Act (TSCA) assistance line (202-554-1404).</p>

<p>Some studies suggest that coating pressed wood products with polyurethane
may reduce formaldehyde emissions for some period of time. To be effective,
any such coating must cover all surfaces and edges and remain intact. Increase
the ventilation and carefully follow the manufacturernstructions while
applying these coatings. (If you are sensitive to formaldehyde, check the
label contents before purchasing coating products to avoid buying products
that contain formaldehyde, as they will emit the chemical for a short time
after application.) Maintain moderate temperature and humidity levels and
provide adequate ventilation. The rate at which formaldehyde is released
is accelerated by heat and may also depend somewhat on the humidity level.
Therefore, the use of dehumidifiers and air conditioning to control humidity
and to maintain a moderate temperature can help reduce formaldehyde emissions.
(Drain and clean dehumidifier collection trays frequently so that they
do not become a breeding ground for microorganisms.) Increasing the rate
of ventilation in your home will also help in reducing formaldehyde levels.
</p>

<p>PESTICIDES </p>

<p>According to a recent survey, 75 percent of U.S. households used at
least one pesticide product indoors during the past year. Products used
most often are insecticides and disinfectants. Another study suggests that
80 percent of most people's exposure to pesticides occurs indoors and that
measurable levels of up to a dozen pesticides have been found in the air
inside homes. The amount of pesticides found in homes appears to be greater
than can be explained by recent pesticide use in those households; other
possible sources include contaminated soil or dust that floats or is tracked
in from outside, stored pesticide containers, and household surfaces that
collect and then release the pesticides. Pesticides used in and around
the home include products to control insects (insecticides), termites (termiticides),
rodents (rodenticides), fungi (fungicides), and microbes (disinfectants).
They are sold as sprays, liquids, sticks, powders, crystals, balls, and
foggers.</p>

<p>In 1990, the American Association of Poison Control Centers reported
that some 79,000 children were involved in common household pesticide poisonings
or exposures. In households with children under five years old, almost
one-half stored at least one pesticide product within reach of children.
EPA registers pesticides for use and requires manufacturers to put information
on the label about when and how to use the pesticide. It is important to
remember that the to kill.ese products can be dangerous if not used properly.
In addition to the active ingredient, pesticides are also made up of ingredients
that are used to carry the active agent. These carrier agents are called
Household Products. However, as with other household products, there is
insufficient understanding at present about what pesticide concentrations
are necessary to produce these effects. Exposure to high levels of cyclodiene
pesticides, commonly associated with misapplication, has produced various
symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, muscle twitching, weakness, tingling
sensations, and nausea. In addition, EPA is concerned that cyclodienes
might cause long-term damage to the liver and the central nervous system,
as well as an increased risk of cancer. There is no further sale or commercial
use permitted for the following cyclodiene or related pesticides: chlordane,
aldrin, dieldrin, and heptachlor. The only exception is the use of heptachlor
by utility companies to control fire ants in underground cable boxes.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Pesticides in Homes</p>

<p>1) Read the label and follow the directions.</p>

<p>It is illegal to use any pesticide in any manner inconsistent with the
directions on its label. Unless you have had special training and are certified,
never use a pesticide that is restricted to use by state-certified pest
control operators. Such pesticides are simply too dangerous for application
by a noncertified person.</p>

<p>2) Use only the pesticides approved for use by the general public and
then only in recommended amounts; increasing the amount does not offer
more protection against pests and can be harmful to you and your plants
and pets. </p>

<p>3) Ventilate the area well after pesticide use.</p>

<p>Mix or dilute pesticides outdoors or in a well-ventilated area and only
in the amounts that will be immediately needed. If possible, take plants
and pets outside when applying pesticides to them. </p>

<p>4) Use nonchemical methods of pest control when possible.</p>

<p>Since pesticides can be found far from the site of their original application,
it is prudent to reduce the use of chemical pesticides outdoors as well
as indoors. Depending on the site and pest to be controlled, one or more
of the following steps can be effective: use of biological pesticides,
such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; selection
of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and
pets. Termite damage can be reduced or prevented by making certain that
wooden building materials do not come into direct contact with the soil
and by storing firewood away from the home. By appropriately fertilizing,
watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatments
of lawns can be dramatically reduced.</p>

<p>5) If you decide to use a pest control company, choose one carefully.
</p>

<p>Ask for an inspection of your home and get a written control program
for evaluation before you sign a contract. The control program should list
specific names of pests to be controlled and chemicals to be used; it should
also reflect any of your safety concerns. Insist on a proven record of
competence and customer satisfaction. </p>

<p>6) Dispose of unwanted pesticides safely.</p>

<p>If you have unused or partially used pesticide containers you want to
get rid of, dispose of them according to the directions on the label or
on special household hazardous waste collection days. If there are no such
collection days in your community, work with others to organize them.</p>

<p>7) Keep exposure to moth repellents to a minimum. </p>

<p>One pesticide often found in the home is paradichlorobenzene, a commonly
used active ingredient in moth repellents. This chemical is known to cause
cancer in animals, but substantial scientific uncertainty exists over the
effects, if any, of long-term human exposure to paradichlorobenzene. EPA
requires that products containing paradichlorobenzene bear warnings such
as &quot;avoid breathing vapors&quot; to warn users of potential short-term
toxic effects. Where possible, paradichlorobenzene, and items to be protected
against moths, should be placed in trunks or other containers that can
be stored in areas that are separately ventilated from the home, such as
attics and detached garages. Paradichlorobenzene is also the key active
ingredient in many air fresheners (in fact, some labels for moth repellents
recommend that these same products be used as air fresheners or deodorants).
Proper ventilation and basic household cleanliness will go a long way toward
preventing unpleasant odors. </p>

<p>8) Call the National Pesticide Telecommunications Network (NPTN).</p>

<p>EPA sponsors the NPTN (800-858-PEST) to answer your questions about
pesticides and to provide selected EPA publications on pesticides. </p>

<p>ASBESTOS </p>

<p>Asbestos is a mineral fiber that has been used commonly in a variety
of building construction materials for insulation and as a fire-retardant.
EPA and CPSC have banned several asbestos products. Manufacturers have
also voluntarily limited uses of asbestos. Today, asbestos is most commonly
found in older homes, in pipe and furnace insulation materials, asbestos
shingles, millboard, textured paints and other coating materials, and floor
tiles. Elevated concentrations of airborne asbestos can occur after asbestos-containing
materials are disturbed by cutting, sanding or other remodeling activities.
Improper attempts to remove these materials can release asbestos fibers
into the air in homes, increasing asbestos levels and endangering people
living in those homes. </p>

<p>Health Effects of Asbestos</p>

<p>The most dangerous asbestos fibers are too small to be visible. After
they are inhaled, they can remain and accumulate in the lungs. Asbestos
can cause lung cancer, meso-thelioma (a cancer of the chest and abdominal
linings), and asbestosis (irreversible lung scarring that can be fatal).
Symptoms of these diseases do not show up until many years after exposure
began. Most people with asbestos-related diseases were exposed to elevated
concentrations on the job; some developed disease from exposure to clothing
and equipment brought home from job sites.</p>

<p>Reducing Exposure to Asbestos in Homes</p>

<p>1) Learn how asbestos problems are created in homes. </p>

<p>Read the booklet, Asbestos in Your Home, issued by CPSC, the ALA, and
EPA. To contact these organizations, see the section, &quot;Where to Go
For More Information.</p>

<p>2) If you think your home may have asbestos, dont panic! </p>

<p>Usually it is best to leave asbestos material that is in good condition
alone. Generally, material in good condition will not release asbestos
fiber. There is no danger unless fibers are released and inhaled into the
lungs. Do not cut, rip, or sand asbestos-containing materials. Leave undamaged
materials alone and, to the extent possible, prevent them from being damaged,
disturbed, or touched. Periodically inspect for damage or deterioration.</p>

<p>3) Discard damaged or worn asbestos gloves, stove-top pads, or ironing
board covers.</p>

<p>Check with local health, environmental, or other appropriate officials
to find out about proper handling and disposal procedures. If asbestos
material is more than slightly damaged, or if you are going to make changes
in your home that might disturb it, repair or removal by a professional
is needed.</p>

<p>4) Before you have your house remodeled, find out whether asbestos materials
are present. </p>

<p>5) When you need to remove or clean up asbestos, use a professionally
trained contractor. </p>

<p>Select a contractor only after careful discussion of the problems in
your home and the steps the contractor will take to clean up or remove
them. Consider the option of sealing off the materials instead of removing
them. </p>

<p>Call EPASCA assistance line (202-554-1404) to find out whether your
state has a training and certification program for asbestos removal contractors
and for information on EPAsbestos programs.</p>

<p>LEAD</p>

<p>Lead has long been recognized as a harmful environmental pollutant.
In late 1991, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
called lead the &quot;number one environmental threat to the health of
children in the United States.&quot; There are many ways in which humans
are exposed to lead: through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil,
deteriorating paint, and dust. Airborne lead enters the body when an individual
breathes or swallows lead particles or dust once it has settled. Before
it was known how harmful lead could be, it was used in paint, gasoline,
water pipes, and many other products. Old lead-based paint is the most
significant source of lead exposure in the U.S. today. Harmful exposures
to lead can be created when lead-based paint is improperly removed from
surfaces by dry scraping, sanding, or open-flame burning. High concentrations
of airborne lead particles in homes can also result from lead dust from
outdoor sources, including contaminated soil tracked inside, and use of
lead in certain indoor activities such as soldering and stained-glass making.</p>

<p>Health Effects of Exposure to Lead</p>

<p>Lead affects practically all systems within the body. At high levels
it can cause convulsions, coma, and even death. Lower levels of lead can
adversely affect the brain, central nervous system, blood cells, and kidneys.
The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe.
They include delays in physical and mental development, lower IQ levels,
shortened attention spans, and increased behavioral problems. Fetuses,
infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead exposure than adults
since lead is more easily absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues
of small children are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Children
may have higher exposures since they are more likely to get lead dust on
their hands and then put their fingers or other lead-contaminated objects
into their mouths. Get your child tested for lead exposure. To find out
where to do this, call your doctor or local health clinic. For more information
on health effects, get a copy of the Centers for Disease Control's, Preventing
Lead Poisoning in Young Children (October 1991). </p>

<p>Ways to Reduce Exposure to Lead</p>

<p>1) Keep areas where children play as dust-free and clean as possible.
</p>

<p>Mop floors and wipe window ledges and chewable surfaces such as cribs
with a solution of powdered automatic dishwasher detergent in warm water.
(Dishwasher detergents are recommended because of their high content of
phosphate.) Most multi-purpose cleaners will not remove lead in ordinary
dust. Wash toys and stuffed animals regularly. Make sure that children
wash their hands before meals, nap time, and bedtime. </p>

<p>2) Reduce the risk from lead-based paint. </p>

<p>Most homes built before 1960 contain heavily leaded paint. Some homes
built as recently as 1978 may also contain lead paint. This paint could
be on window frames, walls, the outside of homes, or other surfaces. Do
not burn painted wood since it may contain lead.</p>

<p>3) Leave lead-based paint undisturbed if it is in good condition; do
not sand or burn off paint that may contain lead.</p>

<p>Lead paint in good condition is usually not a problem except in places
where painted surfaces rub against each other and create dust (for example,
opening a window).</p>

<p>4) Do not remove lead paint yourself.</p>

<p>Individuals have been poisoned by scraping or sanding lead paint because
these activities generate large amounts of lead dust. Consult your state
health or housing department for suggestions on which private laboratories
or public agencies may be able to help test your home for lead in paint.
Home test kits cannot detect small amounts of lead under some conditions.
Hire a person with special training for correcting lead paint problems
to remove lead-based paint. Occupants, especially children and pregnant
women, should leave the building until all work is finished and clean-up
is done. </p>

<p>For additional information dealing with lead-based paint abatement contact
the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the following two documents:
Comprehensive and Workable Plan for the Abatement of Lead-Based Paint in
Privately Owned Housing: Report to Congress (December 7, 1990) and Lead-Based
Paint: Interim Guidelines for Hazard Identification and Abatement in Public
and Indian Housing (September 1990).</p>

<p>5) Do not bring lead dust into the home. </p>

<p>If you work in construction, demolition, painting, with batteries, in
a radiator repair shop or lead factory, or your hobby involves lead, you
may unknowingly bring lead into your home on your hands or clothes. You
may also be tracking in lead from soil around your home. Soil very close
to homes may be contaminated from lead paint on the outside of the building.
Soil by roads and highways may be contaminated from years of exhaust fumes
from cars and trucks that used leaded gas. Use door mats to wipe your feet
before entering the home. If you work with lead in your job or a hobby,
change your clothes before you go home and wash these clothes separately.
Encourage your children to play in sand and grassy areas instead of dirt
which sticks to fingers and toys. Try to keep your children from eating
dirt, and make sure they wash their hands when they come inside. </p>

<p>6) Find out about lead in drinking water. </p>

<p>Most well and city water does not usually contain lead. Water usually
picks up lead inside the home from household plumbing that is made with
lead materials. The only way to know if there is lead in drinking water
is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water
supplier to find out how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA pamphlet,
Lead and Your Drinking Water, for more information about what you can do
if you have lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water
Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.</p>

<p>7) Eat right. </p>

<p>A child who gets enough iron and calcium will absorb less lead. Foods
rich in iron include eggs, red meats, and beans. Dairy products are high
in calcium. Do not store food or liquid in lead crystal glassware or imported
or old pottery. If you reuse old plastic bags to store or carry food, keep
the printing on the outside of the bag. You can get a brochure, Lead Poisoning
and Your Children, and more information by calling the National Lead Information
Center, 800-LEAD-FYI. </p>

<p>WHEN BUILDING A NEW HOME </p>

<p>Building a new home provides the opportunity for preventing indoor air
problems. However, it can result in exposure to higher levels of indoor
air contaminants if careful attention is not given to potential pollution
sources and the air exchange rate. Express your concerns about indoor air
quality to your architect or builder and enlist his or her cooperation
in taking measures to provide good indoor air quality. Talk both about
purchasing building materials and furnishings that are low-emitting and
about providing an adequate amount of ventilation. The American Society
of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers recommends a
ventilation rate of 0.35 ach (air changes per hour) for new homes, and
some new homes are built to even tighter specifications. Particular care
should be given in such homes to preventing the build-up of indoor air
pollutants to high levels.</p>

<p>Here are a few important actions that can make a difference:</p>

<p>1) Use radon-resistant construction techniques.</p>

<p>Obtain a copy of the EPA booklet, Radon-Resistant Construction Techniques
for Residential Construction, from your state radon office or health agency,
your state homebuilders' association, or your EPA regional office.</p>

<p>2) Choose building materials and furnishings that will keep indoor air
pollution to a minimum.</p>

<p>There are many actions a homeowner can take to select products that
will prevent indoor air problems from occurring; a couple of them are mentioned
here. First, use exterior-grade pressed wood products made with phenol-formaldehyde
resin in floors, cabinetry, and wall surfaces. Or, as an alternative, consider
using solid wood products. Secondly, if you plan to install wall-to-wall
carpet on concrete in contact with the ground, especially concrete in basements,
make sure that an effective moisture barrier is installed prior to installing
the carpet. Do not per- manently adhere carpet to concrete with adhesives
so that the carpet can be removed if it becomes wet.</p>

<p>3) Provide proper drainage and seal foundations in new construction.</p>

<p>Air that enters the home through the foundation can contain more moisture
than is generated from all occupant activities. </p>

<p>4) Become familiar with mechanical ventilation systems and consider
installing one.</p>

<p>Advanced designs of new homes are starting to feature mechanical systems
that bring outdoor air into the home. Some of these designs include energy-efficient
heat recovery ventilators (also known as air-to-air heat exchangers).</p>

<p>5) Ensure that combustion appliances, including furnaces, fireplaces,
woodstoves, and heaters, are properly vented and receive enough supply
air. </p>

<p>Combustion gases, including carbon monoxide, and particles can be back-drafted
from the chimney or flue into the living space if the combustion appliance
is not properly vented or does not receive enough supply air. Back-drafting
can be a particular problem in weatherized or tightly constructed homes.
Installing a dedicated outdoor air supply for the combustion appliance
can help prevent backdrafting.</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>DO YOU SUSPECT YOUR OFFICE HAS AN INDOOR AIR PROBLEM?</p>

<p>Indoor air quality problems are not limited to homes. In fact, many
office buildings have significant air pollution sources. Some of these
buildings may be inadequately ventilated. For example, mechanical ventilation
systems may not be designed or operated to provide adequate amounts of
outdoor air. Finally, people generally have less control over the indoor
environment in their offices than they do in their homes. As a result,
there has been an increase in the incidence of reported health problems.</p>

<p>HEALTH EFFECTS</p>

<p>A number of well-identified illnesses, such as Legionnaire's disease,
asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, have been directly
traced to specific building problems. These are called building-related
illnesses. Most of these diseases can be treated; nevertheless, some pose
serious risks. Sometimes, however, building occupants experience symptoms
that do not fit the pattern of any particular illness and are difficult
to trace to any specific source. This phenomenon has been labeled sick
building syndrome. People may complain of one or more of the following
symptoms: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat;
sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; fatigue or lethargy; headache; dizziness;
nausea; irritability and forgetfulness. Poor lighting, noise, vibration,
thermal discomfort, and psychological stress may also cause, or contribute
to, these symptoms. There is no single manner in which these health problems
appear. In some cases, problems begin as workers enter their offices and
diminish as workers leave; other times, symptoms continue until the illness
is treated. Sometimes there are outbreaks of illness among many workers
in a single building; in other cases, health symptoms show up only in individual
workers. In the opinion of some World Health Organization experts, up to
30 percent of new or remodeled commercial buildings may have unusually
high rates of health and comfort complaints from occupants that may potentially
be related to indoor air quality.</p>

<p>WHAT CAUSES PROBLEMS?</p>

<p>Three major reasons for poor indoor air quality in office buildings
are the presence of indoor air pollution sources; poorly designed, maintained,
or operated ventilation systems; and uses of the building that were unanticipated
or poorly planned for when the building was designed or renovated. Sources
of Office Air Pollution As with homes, the most important factor influencing
indoor air quality is the presence of pollutant sources. Commonly found
office pollutants and their sources include environmental tobacco smoke;
asbestos from insulating and fire-retardant building supplies; formaldehyde
from pressed wood products; other organics from building materials, carpet,
and other office furnishings, cleaning materials and activities, restroom
air fresheners, paints, adhesives, copying machines, and photography and
print shops; biological contaminants from dirty ventilation systems or
water-damaged walls, ceilings, and carpets; and pesticides from pest management
practices. Ventilation Systems Mechanical ventilation systems in large
buildings are designed and operated not only to heat and cool the air,
but also to draw in and circulate outdoor air. If they are poorly designed,
operated, or maintained, however, ventilation systems can contribute to
indoor air problems in several ways. For example, problems arise when,
in an effort to save energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring
in adequate amounts of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also occurs
if the air supply and return vents within each room are blocked or placed
in such a way that outdoor air does not actually reach the breathing zone
of building occupants. Improperly located outdoor air intake vents can
also bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler
emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms. Finally,
ventilation systems can be a source of in door pollution themselves by
spreading biological contaminants that have multiplied in cooling towers,
humidifiers, dehumidifiers, air conditioners, or the inside surfaces of
ventilation duct work.</p>

<p>Use of the Building Indoor air pollutants can be circulated from portions
of the building used for specialized purposes, such as restaurants, print
shops, and dry-cleaning stores, into offices in the same building. Carbon
monoxide and other components of automobile exhaust can be drawn from underground
parking garages through stairwells and elevator shafts into office spaces.
In addition, buildings originally designed for one purpose may end up being
converted to use as office space. If not properly modified during building
renovations, the room partitions and ventilation system can contribute
to indoor air quality problems by restricting air recirculation or by providing
an inadequate supply of outdoor air. </p>

<p>WHAT TO DO IF YOU SUSPECT A PROBLEM</p>

<p>If you or others at your office are experiencing health or comfort problems
that you suspect may be caused by indoor air pollution, you can do the
following: </p>

<p>1) Talk with other workers, your supervisor, and union representatives
to see if the problems are being experienced by others and urge that a
record of reported health complaints be kept by management, if one has
not already been established.</p>

<p>2) Talk with your own physician and report your problems to the company
physician, nurse, or health and safety officer. </p>

<p>3) Call your state or local health department or air pollution control
agency to talk over the symptoms and possible causes.</p>

<p>4) Encourage building management to obtain a copy of Building Air Quality:
A Guide for Building Owners and Facility Managers. Building Air Quality
(BAQ) is simply written, yet provides comprehensive information for identifying,
correcting, and preventing indoor air quality problems. BAQ also provides
supporting information such as when and how to select outside technical
assistance, how to communicate with others regarding indoor air issues,
and where to find additional sources of information. BAQ is available for
$24 from U.S. GPO, Superintendent of Documents, P.O. Box 371954, Pittsburgh,
PA 15250-7954; stock #055-000-00390-4 or call (202) 783-3238.</p>

<p>5) Frequently, indoor air quality problems in large commercial buildings
cannot be effectively identified or remedied without a comprehensive building
investigation. These investigations may start with written questionnaires
and telephone consultations in which building investigators assess the
history of occupant symptoms and building operation procedures. In some
cases, these inquiries may quickly uncover the problem and on-site visits
are unnecessary.</p>

<p>6) More often, however, investigators will need to come to the building
to conduct personal interviews with occupants, to look for possible sources
of the problems, and to inspect the design and operation of the ventilation
system and other building features. Because taking measurements of pollutants
at the very low levels often found in office buildings is expensive and
may not yield information readily useful in identifying problem sources,
investigators may not take many measurements. The process of solving indoor
air quality problems that result in health and comfort complaints can be
a slow one, involving several trial solutions before successful remedial
actions are identified. </p>

<p>7) If a professional company is hired to conduct a building investigation,
select a company on the basis of its experience in identifying and solving
indoor air quality problems in nonindustrial buildings. </p>

<p>8) Work with others to establish a smoking policy that eliminates involuntary
nonsmoker exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>9) Call the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
for information on obtaining a health hazard evaluation of your office
(800-35NIOSH), or contact the Occupational Safety and Health Administration,
(202) 219-8151.</p>

<p>COMMON ALLERGEN</p>

<p>Dust mites, microscopic animals found in household dust, produce a common
allergen. Exposure to house dust mites, animal-related allergens (animal
dander and cat saliva), and mold have been estimated to cause 200,000 or
more emergency room visits a year by asthma patients. Humid or damp conditions
usually lead to greater numbers of dust mites.</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<p>WHAT ABOUT CARPET?</p>

<p>In recent years, a number of consumers have associated a variety of
symptoms with the installation of new carpet. Scientists have not been
able to determine whether the chemicals emitted by new carpets are responsible.
If you are installing new carpet, you may wish to take the following steps:</p>

<p>1) Talk to your carpet retailer. Ask for information on emissions from
carpet.</p>

<p>2) Ask the retailer to unroll and air out the carpet in a well-ventilated
area before installation. </p>

<p>3) Ask for low-emitting adhesives if adhesives are needed.</p>

<p>4) Consider leaving the premises during and immediately after carpet
installation. You may wish to schedule the installation when most family
members or office workers are out.</p>

<p>5) Be sure the retailer requires the installer to follow the Carpet
and Rug Institute's installation guidelines.</p>

<p>6) Open doors and windows. Increasing the amount of fresh air in the
home will reduce exposure to most chemicals released from carpet. During
and after installation, use window fans, room air conditioners, or other
mechanical ventilation equipment you may have installed in your house,
to exhaust fumes to the outdoors. Keep them running for 48 to 72 hours
after the new carpet is installed.</p>

<p>7) Contact your carpet retailer if objectionable odors persist.</p>

<p>8) Follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper carpet maintenance.</p>

<p><b>REFERENCE GUIDE TO MAJOR INDOOR AIR POLLUTANTS IN THE HOME</b></p>

<p>The pollutants listed in this guide have been shown to cause the health
effects mentioned. However, it is not necessarily true that the effects
noted occur at the pollutant concentration levels typically found in the
home. In many cases, our understanding of the pollutants and their health
effects is too limited to determine the levels at which the listed effects
could occur. </p>

<p><b>RADON</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Earth and rock beneath home; well water; building materials.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: No immediate symptoms. Estimated to contribute
to between 7,000 and 30,000 lung cancer deaths each year. Smokers are at
higher risk of developing radon-induced lung cancer.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Based on a national residential radon survey
completed in 1991, the average indoor radon level is 1.3 picocuries per
liter (pCi/L). The average outdoor level is about 0.4 pCi/L.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1)Test your home for radon_it's easy and inexpensive.</p>

<p>2)Fix your home if your radon level is 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L)
or higher.</p>

<p>3)Radon levels less than 4 pCi/L still pose a risk, and in many cases
may be reduced.</p>

<p>4) If you want more information on radon, contact your state radon office,
or call 800-SOS RADON.</p>

<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO SMOKE </b></p>

<p><b>Source</b>: Cigarette, pipe, and cigar smoking.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches;
lung cancer; may contribute to heart disease. Specifically for children,
increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis
and pneumonia, and ear infections; build-up of fluid in the middle ear;
increased severity and frequency of asthma episodes; decreased lung function.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Particle levels in homes without smokers or
other strong particle sources are the same as, or lower than, those outdoors.
Homes with one or more smokers may have particle levels several times higher
than outdoor levels.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure:</b></p>

<p>1) Do not smoke in your home or permit others to do so.</p>

<p>2) Do not smoke if children are present, particularly infants and toddlers.</p>

<p>3) If smoking indoors cannot be avoided, increase ventilation in the
area where smoking takes place. Open windows or use exhaust fans.</p>

<p><b>BIOLOGICALS</b> </p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Wet or moist walls, ceilings, carpets, and furniture;
poorly maintained humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioners; bedding;
household pets. </p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; shortness of
breath; dizziness; lethargy; fever; digestive problems. Can cause asthma;
humidifier fever; influenza and other infectious diseases.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Indoor levels of pollen and fungi are lower
than outdoor levels (except where indoor sources of fungi are present).
Indoor levels of dust mites are higher than outdoor levels.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>: </p>

<p>1) Install and use fans vented to outdoors in kitchens and bathrooms.</p>

<p>2) Vent clothes dryers to outdoors.</p>

<p>3) Clean cool mist and ultrasonic humidifiers in accordance with manufacturer's
instructions and refill with clean water daily.</p>

<p>4) Empty water trays in air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and refrigerators
frequently. </p>

<p>5) Clean and dry or remove water-damaged carpets. </p>

<p>6) Use basements as living areas only if they are leakproof and have
adequate ventilation. Use dehumidifiers, if necessary, to maintain humidity
between 30_50 percent. </p>

<p><b>CARBON MONOXIDE </b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Unvented kerosene and gas space heaters; leaking chimneys
and furnaces; back-drafting from furnaces, gas water heaters, woodstoves,
and fireplaces; gas stoves. Automobile exhaust from attached garages. Environmental
tobacco smoke.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: At low concentrations, fatigue in healthy people
and chest pain in people with heart disease. At higher concentrations,
impaired vision and coordination; headaches; dizziness; confusion; nausea.
Can cause flu-like symptoms that clear up after leaving home. Fatal at
very high concentrations.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Average levels in homes without gas stoves vary
from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm). Levels near properly adjusted gas
stoves are often 5 to 15 ppm and those near poorly adjusted stoves may
be 30 ppm or higher.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>: </p>

<p>1) Keep gas appliances properly adjusted.</p>

<p>2) Consider purchasing a vented space heater when replacing an unvented
one.</p>

<p>3) Use proper fuel in kerosene space heaters.</p>

<p>4) Install and use an exhaust fan vented to outdoors over gas stoves.</p>

<p>5) Open flues when fireplaces are in use. </p>

<p>6) Choose properly sized woodstoves that are certified to meet EPA emission
standards. Make certain that doors on all woodstoves fit tightly. </p>

<p>7) Have a trained professional inspect, clean, and tune-up central heating
system (furnaces, flues, and chimneys) annually. Repair any leaks promptly.</p>

<p>8) Do not idle the car inside garage. </p>

<p><b>NITROGEN DIOXIDE</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Kerosene heaters, unvented gas stoves and heaters. Environmental
tobacco smoke.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation. May cause impaired
lung function and increased respiratory infections in young children.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Average level in homes without combustion appliances
is about half that of outdoors. In homes with gas stoves, kerosene heaters,
or unvented gas space heaters, indoor levels often exceed outdoor levels.
</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>: See steps under carbon monoxide. </p>

<p><b>ORGANIC GASES</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Household products including: paints, paint strippers,
and other solvents; wood preservatives; aerosol sprays; cleansers and disinfectants;
moth repellents and air fresheners; stored fuels and automotive products;
hobby supplies; dry-cleaned clothing. </p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; headaches,
loss of coordination, nausea; damage to liver, kidney, and central nervous
system. Some organics can cause cancer in animals; some are suspected or
known to cause cancer in humans. </p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Studies have found that levels of several organics
average 2 to 5 times higher indoors than outdoors. During and for several
hours immediately after certain activities, such as paint stripping, levels
may be 1,000 times background outdoor levels.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) Use household products according to manufacturer's directions.</p>

<p>2) Make sure you provide plenty of fresh air when using these products.</p>

<p>3) Throw away unused or little-used containers safely; buy in quantities
that you will use soon.</p>

<p>4) Keep out of reach of children and pets.</p>

<p>5) Never mix household care products unless directed on the label.</p>

<p><b>RESPIRABLE PARTICLES</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Fireplaces, woodstoves, and kerosene heaters. Environmental
tobacco smoke.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; respiratory
infections and bronchitis; lung cancer. (Effects attributable to environmental
tobacco smoke are listed elsewhere.)</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Particle levels in homes without smoking or
other strong particle sources are the same as, or lower than, outdoor levels.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) Vent all furnaces to outdoors; keep doors to rest of house open when
using unvented space heaters.</p>

<p>2) Choose properly sized woodstoves, certified to meet EPA emission
standards; make certain that doors on all woodstoves fit tightly. </p>

<p>3) Have a trained professional inspect, clean, and tune-up central heating
system (furnace, flues, and chimneys) annually. Repair any leaks promptly.
</p>

<p>4) Change filters on central heating and cooling systems and air cleaners
according to manufac-turer's directions.</p>

<p><b>FORMALDEHYDE</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Pressed wood products (hardwood plywood wall paneling,
particleboard, fiberboard) and furniture made with these pressed wood products.
Urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI). Combustion sources and environmental
tobacco smoke. Durable press drapes, other textiles, and glues. </p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Eye, nose, and throat irritation; wheezing and
coughing; fatigue; skin rash; severe allergic reactions. May cause cancer.
May also cause other effects listed under &quot;organic gases.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Average concentrations in older homes without
UFFI are generally well below 0.1 (ppm). In homes with significant amounts
of new pressed wood products, levels can be greater than 0.3 ppm.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>: </p>

<p>1) Use &quot;exterior-grade&quot; pressed wood products (lower-emitting
because they contain phenol resins, not urea resins).</p>

<p>2) Use air conditioning and dehumidifiers to maintain moderate temperature
and reduce humidity levels.</p>

<p>3) Increase ventilation, particularly after bringing new sources of
formaldehyde into the home.</p>

<p><b>PESTICIDES</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Products used to kill household pests (insecticides,
termiticides, and disinfectants). Also, products used on lawns and gardens
that drift or are tracked inside the house.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Irritation to eye, nose, and throat; damage to
central nervous system and kidney; increased risk of cancer. </p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes</b>: Preliminary research shows widespread presence
of pesticide residues in homes.</p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) Use strictly according to manufacturer's directions.</p>

<p>2) Mix or dilute outdoors.</p>

<p>3) Apply only in recommended quantities. </p>

<p>4) Increase ventilation when using indoors. Take plants or pets outdoors
when applying pesticides to them.</p>

<p>5) Use nonchemical methods of pest control where possible. </p>

<p>6) If you use a pest control company, select it carefully.</p>

<p>7) Do not store unneeded pesticides inside home; dispose of unwanted
containers safely. </p>

<p>8) Store clothes with moth repellents in separately ventilated areas,
if possible. </p>

<p>9) Keep indoor spaces clean, dry, and well ventilated to avoid pest
and odor problems. </p>

<p><b>ASBESTOS</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Deteriorating, damaged, or disturbed insulation, fireproofing,
acoustical materials, and floor tiles.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: No immediate symptoms, but long-term risk of
chest and abdominal cancers and lung diseases. Smokers are at higher risk
of developing asbestos-induced lung cancer.</p>

<p><b>Levels in Homes:</b> Elevated levels can occur in homes where asbestos-containing
materials are damaged or disturbed. </p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) It is best to leave undamaged asbestos material alone if it is not
likely to be disturbed. </p>

<p>2) Use trained and qualified contractors for control measures that may
disturb asbestos and for cleanup.</p>

<p>3)Follow proper procedures in replacing woodstove door gaskets that
may contain asbestos.</p>

<p><b>LEAD</b></p>

<p><b>Sources</b>: Lead-based paint, contaminated soil, dust, and drinking
water.</p>

<p><b>Health Effects</b>: Lead affects practically all systems within the
body. Lead at high levels (lead levels at or above 80 micrograms per deciliter
(80 _g/dl) of blood) can cause convulsions, coma, and even death. Lower
levels of lead can cause adverse health effects on the central nervous
system, kidney, and blood cells. Blood lead levels as low as 10 _g/dl can
impair mental and physical development. </p>

<p><b>Steps to Reduce Exposure</b>:</p>

<p>1) Keep areas where children play as dust-free and clean as possible.</p>

<p>2) Leave lead-based paint undisturbed if it is in good condition; do
not sand or burn off paint that may contain lead.</p>

<p>3) Do not remove lead paint yourself. </p>

<p>4) Do not bring lead dust into the home. </p>

<p>5) If your work or hobby involves lead, change clothes and use doormats
before entering your home. </p>

<p>6) Eat a balanced diet, rich in calcium and iron. </p>

<p><b>PESTS</b></p>

<p>There are simple steps people can take to prevent, reduce, or control
pest infestations. Such techniques can become part of an overall pest management
program (sometimes called &quot;integrated&quot; pest management) that
relies on many techniques, not just chemicals.</p>
