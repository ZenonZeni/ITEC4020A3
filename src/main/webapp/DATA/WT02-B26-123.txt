Most readers pick up magazines with passing interest. Our readers pick up Barron's with passionate interest. Because they know information and ideas of value are on every page, and they don't want to miss a thing. <P>

Every week, Barron's  covers money and markets -- how they come together, what results, and why that's important. Which is why important people read it with absorption...page-after-page, cover-to-cover. And that's the audience, in exactly the right editorial environment, that most advertisers are looking for.
<P>

<a name="C"><H3>Professional Investing</H3></a><P>

Every Friday afternoon, it's the same. The roar of trading fades, and institutional investors start readying themselves for Monday morning's bell. Their preparation starts on Saturday morning, in the reflective calm home offers, with Barron's.<P>

Why do they read Barron's? Because Barron's covers what and how much money is going into which markets, sectors, industries and companies...and also tells them why. The result? The edge they need to succeed in the complex, fast-paced financial markets of today.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>


<a name="D"><H3>Personal Investments</H3></a><P>

Desire is what the markets are all about. The desire to discover value overlooked by others and to convert value over time to profit. Smart readers come to Barron's to find value...and to arm themselves against the predations and pitfalls of the marketplace. And it seems to have worked. The numbers tell the story of Barron's readers' affluence and success.<P>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><a href="#top">Back to the top of the page.</a><hr></BLOCKQUOTE>



<a name="E"><H3>Computer Use</H3></a><P>

Daily, the world gets more complex as technology changes the face of business and finance. But Barron's readers are on the leading edge of that change. They are connected to the global information network, both at home on their own personal computers and at work, where they spend an average of 18 hours a week in front of their computer screens. They access on-line services, surveying all there is to offer from this new frontier. And they use the latest and most sophisticated financial software available.<P>

Here are some compelling reasons why the Barron's audience is attractive to high-tech advertisers:<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 69.5% have a personal computer at home.<P>

<a name="F"><H3>Travel</H3></a><P>

Affluent individuals and important corporate executives are the two most valuable targets of the travel industry. The former's wealth allows them lavish vacations, while the latter's jobs necessitate frequent travel. Barron's offers a high concentration of both groups, making it a superlative medium for travel advertisers. <P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 83.2% of readers traveled domestically in the past year. <P>
<img src="../IMAGES/pixel.gif"> 52.9% of domestic travelers flew for business reasons, and 73.1% flew for vacation/personal reasons. <P>

It's this knowledge that propels our readers up the economic ladder, into the boardroom and the executive suite...and to travel destinations domestic and abroad.

<a name="G"><H3>Purchasing Patterns and Power</H3></a><P>

Accumulated wealth allows Barron's readers to spend as they wish. And spend they do. These affluentials purchase all of the finer things in life -- furs, jewelry, artwork and collectibles -- as well as the items necessary to the business professional -- suits, dress shoes and accessories.<P>

As athletes train to achieve peak performance, so must market players work to achieve real value. At Barron's, our mission is to keep investors on their toes to assure competitive performance in the markets. But they keep themselves physically active, while actively shaping public opinion.
