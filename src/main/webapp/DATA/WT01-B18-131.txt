<H1>Build Better Cars</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3><I><hr>Analysts argue that a complete reinvention of the
automobile is in order -- which would result in a 100
mpg "hypercar."<hr></I></H3></BLOCKQUOTE>

During the 1973 oil crisis, policy-makers took a hard
look at the nation's energy appetite and found that
transportation consumed more than half the nation's oil.
New cars averaged only 13 miles per gallon. Despite
protests from automakers, Congress passed the Corporate
Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which required
automakers to improve that figure to 27.5 miles per
gallon by 1988. This policy--which doubled new car-fuel
economy--ultimately resulted in less industry
dislocation than Detroit assumed; indeed, it is credited
in many quarters with spurring the technological
revitalization of the U.S. auto industry. The CAFE law
also marks the only  success so far in addressing energy
use in U.S. automobiles.
<P>
What is the potential for extending CAFE standards
again, to 55 mpg by 2005? Many independent engineers
point to cars on the road that get 50 mpg, and indeed
most automakers have built prototype cars that get more
than 100 mpg, without sacrificing performance. Doubling
the fuel economy of the nation's fleet would halve its
consumption of oil, all but eliminating the need for oil
imports.
<P>
Automakers have vigorously, and so far successfully,
resisted such legislation. They argue that customers
want larger cars with more powerful engines, and,
barring a boost in gasoline prices, fuel efficiency is
just not what customers are looking for. Because
legislators are sensitive to the economic importance of
the auto industry and wary of interventions in the
market, it is probably fair to say that in the absence
of another oil crisis, auto fuel-efficiency standards
will stagnate. CAFE worked once, but there is little
chance it will be tried again in the near future.
<P>
One team of analysts, Amory and Hunter Lovins of Rocky
Mountain Institute, argues that a complete reinvention
of the automobile is in order, and that only such a
thorough redesign can push us beyond the CAFE debate <A
HREF = "hypercar.html" name="hyp">(see "Moving toward the
'hypercar'")</A>. Their concepts should lead to cars
that get more than 100 mpg, with drastically reduced
pollution, noise, and required maintenance. If such
"hypercars" were developed, their non-fuel
attributes--safety, reliability, nimbleness, and lower
cost--could induce customer demand. The fuel savings
would be a free byproduct.
