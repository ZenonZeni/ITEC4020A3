<P>
Graduate study in the Department of Marine Science requires course work at
Austin and Port Aransas and a research project at Austin or Port Aransas. The
exact program will be determined by the student's interest, the research field
of his supervisor and the required courses. At present, faculty work in the
basic and applied aspects of the four marine science subdisciplines: <I><B>marine
biology/ecology, marine chemistry, marine geology and physical oceanography</B></I>.
Marine science is the study of the marine environment including marine
organisms, processes, and systems so each student's program will involve direct
contact with the sea, its plants and animals and/or the physical and chemical
forces which drive it.
</P>
<P>
Facilities for graduate work in marine science are based in Austin and at the
shore-side laboratory of the Marine Science Institute in Port Aransas, Texas.
The Institute is located on the Aransas Pass ship channel among the dunes at the
tip of Mustang Island, with easy access to bays, beaches, and the Gulf of
Mexico. Environmental systems nearby include the hypersaline Laguna Madre,
seagrass meadows, fresh and salt water marshes, and the continental shelf. The
Port Aransas facility offers research vessels, a specialized library,
classrooms, laboratories, and flowing seawater system.
</P>
<P>
Course work taken in Austin often includes supporting work in other natural
science departments. At least one academic year is normally spent on the main
campus. Most students then reside in Port Aransas while they undertake thesis or
dissertation research at the Marine Science Institute. These students also take
additional courses there, including the majority of their core courses, other
organized courses, seminars, and training cruises. Graduate student apartments
are available at the Institute.
</P>
<P>
Admission requirements: The student's undergraduate training should include
twenty four semester hours in one of the life or physical sciences. At least
twelve of these hours must be in upper-division work. Adequate preparation in
mathematics is expected of all students.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="MA_Degree">Master of Arts Degree Program</A></H2> 
<P>
Approximately three years of graduate study, which will include original
research and practical experience as a Teaching Assistant, are required to
complete the Masters degree in Marine Science. Students must complete at least
thirty semester hours of acceptable graduate work in marine science and related
natural sciences. A maximum of nine hours of upper-division undergraduate
courses, no more than six of which may be in either the major or the minor, may
be counted. The student's program must include at least one core course in three
of the marine science subdisciplines mentioned above. Core courses are listed in
the Graduate Catalog and in the list attached to this document. A minor, which
is obligatory in every Masters degree program, consists of a minimum of six
hours in supporting work outside the major program. The relative number of hours
in the major or minor fields, as well as the nature of the supporting work, is
determined in consultation with the graduate advisor. A thesis is required and
will account for six hours of the total program. The Masters thesis shall be the
product of original research.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="PhD_Degree">Doctor of Philosophy Degree Program</A>
</H2> 
<P>
Four to six years of graduate study, which will include original research and
practical experience as a Teaching Assistant, are required to complete the Ph.D.
in Marine Science. The Doctoral program should contain no fewer than 18 hours of
acceptable graduate work in marine science and no less than 9 hours in
supporting areas, in addition to dissertation and supervised teaching. Of this
minimal requirement of 18 hours, 12 hours of core courses must be completed,
including at least one core course in each of the marine science subdisciplines
mentioned above. Core courses are listed in the Graduate Catalog and in the list
attached to this document. Supporting work from outside the major program (are
of specialty) may include courses taken at another institution. To be eligible
for admission to candidacy, all doctoral students must complete their core
courses and pass a qualifying examination in their area of specialization. This
examination will also confirm that students are competent in the other three
subdisciplines. Candidacy requirements should be completed by February of the
second year of a student's program if they hold a Master's degree and by
February of the third year if they entered the program with a Bachelor's degree.
All doctoral candidates write a dissertation based on the results of their
original research, and make a formal oral defense of the document to complete
the degree requirements.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="Area_Specialty">Area of Speciality</A></H2> 
<P>
Each graduate student will normally select one of the four subdisciplines as an
area of specialization. Based on the present faculty potential, marine biology,
marine chemistry, and marine geology would be the Department's strongest areas
of specialization for students. As an example, a doctoral student might base the
majority of his/her corse work and dissertation topic in marine biology. The
dissertation research would frequently integrate one or more of the other
subdisciplines studied. Students opting for a major thrust in marine chemistry
or marine geology would follow a similar program with chemistry or geology
forming the major part of their curriculum. Similarly, masters students would
specialize in one subdiscipline.
