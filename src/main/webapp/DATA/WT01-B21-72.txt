<h1>Chronic Migraine Headache: </h1>

<h2>five cases successfully treated with Marinol and/or illicit
cannabis. </h2>

<p><b>Tod H. Mikuriya, M.D.</b> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<hr>

<h2>Case 1 </h2>

<p>A thirty eight year old white female stock broker supervisor
with a twenty-six year history of unilateral vascular headaches
escalating to generalized headache with tension headache overlay.
The severity and frequency of episodes responded only to
parenteral dihydroergotamine, meperidine, and trimethobenzamide
HCl with sedation and further immobilization. </p>

<p>Marinol (delta 1-9 tetrahydrocannabinol dissolved in sesame
oil) was begun with gradual upward titration dropwise to avoid
undesirable mental side effects. She experienced a significant
decrease in the frequency of attacks except when she ran out of
medication. </p>

<p>She tolerated 40 mg daily (10 mg QID) without side effects but
experienced an attack after running out of the THC capsules.
Because of financial straits secondary to her disability status
and the high expense of Marinol she has partially substituted
illicitly obtained marijuana which she has ingested orally with
similar relief. </p>

<p>Over the past four years she has maintained better control
over the attacks with only one trip to the emergency room for a
meperidine treatment in the past two years. She continues to
utilize illicit cannabis because of the high cost of Marinol but
has difficulty with irregular dosage with either too little or
too much. </p>

<h2>Case 2 </h2>

<p>Her mother, a 58 year old hospital ward clerk who has
experienced migraine headaches with similar symptoms but less
profoundly debilitating than those of her daughter.Likewise, she
was treated with a gradually increasing dosageof Marinol with
stabilization at a 10 mg daily dose (5 mg BID).Notwithstanding
her undergoing stressful conditions on the job she experienced
successful stopping of episodes in prodromal stage. </p>

<p>Left neck numbness, anorexia, water retention and left
diplopia were reversed with normalization of gastric motility,
diuresis,and peripheral vasodilation. She subjectively felt a
relief of affectual pressure. She experienced no debilitating
side effects as with other antimigraine agents and sedatives.
Perceptually she described a &quot;shift of vision&quot;-
slightly out of focus. This effect was transient. </p>

<h2>Case 3 </h2>

<p>A 44 year old female teacher has a thirty year history of
familial unilateral severe vascular headaches with antecedent
visual scotomata. She switched to self-medication with marijuana
after 9 years of </p>

<p>meperidine/sedative treatments with their impairing effects. </p>

<h2>Cases 4 &amp; 5 </h2>

<p>She taught her daughters ages 21 and 17 to self-medicate with
marijuana with similar success in aborting migraine headaches in
the prodromal phase with scotomata. </p>

<h2>Discussion </h2>

<p>While hemp drugs (cannabis) were introduced to western
medicine by O'Shaughnessy in 1839 and attained wide usage until
the turn of the century with the development of synthetic and
semisynthetic analgesics.Their use declined though maintaining
mention in medical texts until removal from the formulary in
1940. Reclassified as a schedule I drug in 1970 alleged to having
no medicinal redeeming importance, the synthetic THC created by
government sponsored research contractors was downscheduled to II
in 1986, the same as non-combination opiates requiring triplicate
prescription. </p>

<p>Grinspoon has recently described use of cannabinoids
therapeutically for migraine. </p>

<p>It would appear that further clinical trial of both Marinol
and cannabis for the treatment of migraine headache would be
desirable. </p>
