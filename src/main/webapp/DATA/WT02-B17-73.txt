<H2> Appliance and Lighting Efficiency Standards in the U.S.</H2>

<P>
In 1978 the Department of Energy (DOE) was authorized to set mandatory
energy efficiency standards for 13 household appliances and products
under the National Energy Conservation and Policy Act (NECPA). In 1987
the NECPA was amended and updated by the National Appliance Energy
Conservation Act (NAECA). NAECA superseded existing state requirements
and actually set the first national efficiency standards for home
appliances, as well as a schedule for regular updates, currently
specified to 2012.  Today, NAECA, its updates, and the Energy Policy Act
of 1992 (EPAct), are at the heart of energy efficiency advances in
residential appliances and lighting. Office equipment, plumbing
products, and small electric motors are also now covered under EPAct.
These Federally mandated efficiency standards not only benefit consumers
and the environment by saving energy, they also help make American
appliance manufacturers more competitive in the global market place.  
</P>

<P>Currently, <B>products covered</B> under NAECA, its updates,
and EPAct include: dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers,
refrigerators and freezers, central air conditioners and heat pumps,
room air conditioners, water heaters, swimming pool heaters, direct
heating equipment, furnaces, mobile home furnaces, kitchen ranges and
ovens, fluorescent lamp ballasts, fluorescent and incandescent lamps,
small electric motors, showerheads, faucets, urinals, and water closets.
