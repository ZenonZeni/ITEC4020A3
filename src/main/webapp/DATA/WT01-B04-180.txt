ILL<BR>
PEOPLE TO GET THEIR POT - HNN EDITORIAL<BR>

The Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Fransisco is the Californian version of
the Dutch coffee shop topped with bogus-scientific auspices. The results
of the recent bust of the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Fransisco clearly
revealed how junkies and their allied so-called 'scientists' are trying
to promote the idea of &quot;medicinal marijuana&quot; to promote marijuana.
Without any scientific proof whatsoever these harm productive groups claim
the beneficial results from using marijuana. Without referring to any of
the results of thousands of scientific reports on the damaging effects of
marijuana, even newspapers have bought the arguments. In a 'USA Today' recent
debate article, the headline of 'Our View' reads 'Anti-drug focus keeps
marijuana from the ill'. Among some of the 'arguments' in the article we
find &quot;Marijuana is one of the least toxical compunds in the world.
It poses far fewer pulmonary risks than tobacco and is less addictive than
alcohol. It is even less deadly than aspirin which causes at least 1,000
deaths a year.&quot; The arguments are so bad and show such a lack of knowledge,
one might think the author of the piece was advised by Philip Morris, the
tobacco company which recently, in a European advertising campaign, claimed
it was more dangerous to eat biscuits than being exposed to second-hand
smoking.<BR>
<BR>
Is this science? - NO. It is sheer campaigning. The advocates of Medicinal
marijuana&quot; are campaigning for it as if it was just a matter of launching
a new product - like Pepsi - the choice of a new generation&quot; - Marijuana
- the choice of a terminally ill generation&quot;. The tragedy is that the
advocates take advantage of ill people to support their claims for &quot;medicinal
marijuana&quot;, which obviously makes the whole issue somewhat difficult
for some people as being against medication for ill people might seem a
bit odd. In that respect the strategy of the junkies and their allied so-called
'scientists' is superficially clever. Very much in the same way as those
promoting so-called harm reduction have managed to shut up some of their
critics by asking &quot;Are you against harm reduction?&quot; It is most
advisable to reject so-called 'harm reduction' when it includes legalization
of marijuana, legal distribution of opiates, injection rooms, low threshold
methadone programmes etc. In the same way it is most advisable to reject
manjuana as the choice of a terminally ill generation.<BR>
<BR>
The following fact sheet information about the Cannabis Buyers' Club in
San Fransisco ought to make it very clear that what is going on there has
nothing to do with &quot;medicinal use&quot; based on science.<BR>
<BR>
CANNABIS BUYERS' CLUB FACT SHEET<BR>
<BR>
While claiming to be for the benefit of people who are terminally ill, the
Cannabis Buyers' Club was in fact a major drug distribution center for the
city of San Fransisco. The Club regularly sold marijuana to children, allowed
children and even infants to breathe second-hand marijuana smoke in its
'smoking areas', often sold marijuana without a doctors note or accepted
obviously forged doctor s notes for marijuana sales, and large multi-pound
marijuana deals with undercover agents without asking any medical reason
for the usage.<BR>
<BR>
At the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Fransisco, officials seized<BR>
<BR>
* More than 150 pounds of marijuana valued from $750,000 to over $1 million<BR>
* More than $60,000 in cash<BR>
* More than 400 growing marijuana plants<BR>
* Undercover surveillance films show dozens of infants and small children
(many under the age of 10) inhaling large amounts of marijuana smoke in
the Club. Undercover videos also show the Club selling marijuana to teenagers
and persons who have not provided any medical excuse.<BR>
<BR>
* The Cannabis Buyers' Club claims to serve more than 10,000 members. The
members are purportedly only able to purchase marijuana for Personal use.'
The Club's own rules state remembers cannot buy more than is required for
personal use - &quot;usually not more than 1/4 ounce&quot;. All of the members
are supposed to have a letter from their doctor claiming they suffer from
one or more specific illnesses such as: <BR>
<BR>
HIV<BR>
Cancer<BR>
Multiple sclerosis<BR>
Glaucoma<BR>
Intractable pain<BR>
<BR>
* Undercover agents made a number of buys inside the Cannabis Buyers' Club
and were able to purchase as much as two pounds at a time. In one videotaped
case, the sale was made to an agent who clearly was not sick and who was
never asked by the Club's President for any kind of medical excuse. Undercover
agents alse seized several deliveries of marijuana headed for the Club.<BR>
<BR>
* Drug seizures from street delaers in other areas of San Fransisco have
included a number of baggies with marijuana apparently being re-sold from
the Cannabis Buyers' Club. Some street dealers would even state to their
customers the marijuana must be good since it has the Cannabis Buyers' Club
sticker on the bag.<BR>
<BR>
* Some of the &quot;doctors' notes&quot; used by undercover agents gave
phony doctors' names and addresses which the Cannabis Buyers' Club never
verified. Other notes were even written on scrap paper, without any type
of letterhead. Undercover agents from several law enforcement agencies were
able to purchase marijuana for such&quot;medical uses&quot; as:<BR>
<BR>
vaginal yeast infections <BR>
sore backs <BR>
insomnia <BR>
&quot;low back syndrome&quot; <BR>
colitis<BR>
sciatica<BR>
<BR>
* The Cannabis Buyers' Club is estimated to have sold up to a hundred pounds
of marijuana a week, based on former employee interviews and undercover
surveillance.<BR>
<BR>
* The estimated street value of one pound of marijuana is from $3,900 to
over $10,000 depending upon the grade.<BR>
<BR>
* Health and Safety Code Section 11359 dearly states that &quot;Every person
who possesses for sale any marijuana, except otherwise provided by law,
shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It is important to infomm the general public about the pro-legalizers~ attempt
to legalize the sale of marijuana to critically ill people, as that initiative,
called Proposition 215 or the 'Medical Marijuana Initiative' is on California's
november ballot.<BR>
<BR>
Hassela Nordic Network would like to know since when the practice of approving
a substance for Medicinal use&quot; was transferred to a referendum which
could be the consequence if the Medicinal use&quot; of marijuana is approved
in California's November ballot. Before any other drug can be put on the
market, it must undergo rigorous development and testing to prove that it
is effective and safe, a procedure under the responsibility of the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). Usually laboratories of phammaceutical companies
synthesize new chemicals thought to be effective. The drugs are then screened
using nonhumans to detemmine whether they are toxic and then whether they
have effects similar to known therapeutically useful drugs. When, and if,
the new drug appears to be safe, it goes to phase 1 of human testing, which
should assess the toxicity and side effects of the drug on healthy human
volunteers. Phase 2 involves testing on patients under very carefully supervised
conditions. If these two phases show that the drug has minimal toxic effects
AND a therapeutic effect, it goes to phase 3 with expanded clinical trials.
If phase 3 turns out to be successful the drug is licensed and marketed.<BR>
<BR>
The process does not stop here though. In phase 4 data are accumulated on
the success, or lack of success, of the drug as used in the clinic and attempts
to identify adverse effects not apparent in the short-term testing in earlier
phases. The above procedure has not been applied.to the distribution of
marijuana at the Cannabis Buyers' Club in San Fransisco. The Californian
Club is just another version of the Dutch coffee shop topped with bogus-scientific
auspices. We are pleased to note that action has been taken against this
hamm productive establishment.<BR>
