<P>
The Fed's decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged at its
meeting on September 24th has left many unresolved questions for
the financial markets to ponder.  Was the focus of the FOMC meeting
the outlook for the U.S. economy or the breach of security which
produced a Reuters story about several district banks seeking
a discount rate hike the week before the meeting?  Did the FOMC
renew its previous directive with a bias towards tightening and
thus leave open the possibility of raising interest rates in response
to economic reports during October, or has it closed the door
on possible tightening until November?  How far will the chairman
go in attempting to assert his authority over FOMC dissidents
who have attempted to campaign for a rate hike through conversations
with the media?
<P>
There is no way of telling whether the Reuters story about the
district banks altered the outcome of the FOMC meeting.  <I>If
the retail sales and inflation data published in mid-September
had showed clear signs of accelerating inflation and robust growth
in final demand, there is little doubt that the FOMC would have
hiked interest rates.</I>  But because the data suggested that
growth may be moderating and that inflation is still under control,
the Chairman was able to persuade the FOMC to defer any proposal
for tightening in order to demonstrate that he is still firmly
in control of the Federal Reserve.  It is doubtful, though, that
the FOMC abandoned its bias in favor of tightening.  On the contrary,
if the employment report scheduled to appear on October 4th shows
signs of strong growth in the U.S. economy, the Fed could move
to hike interest rates immediately.  Almost 90% of the upward
move in U.S. bond yields this year has occurred in the minutes
after three employment reports showing large monthly job gains.
 If the October 4th report produces evidence of large job gains
(over 250,000) and the unemployment rate drops below 5.0%, there
will probably be another upward spike in bond yields so large
that the Fed will feel compelled to show that it has not become
totally passive.  The rally in the bond market after the Fed decision
to leave interest rates unchanged demonstrates that investors
are as uncertain about the U.S. economic outlook as the FOMC.
 But since the preconditions for an acceleration of wage growth
and a revival of inflation clearly exist, the Fed cannot afford
to procrastinate for long when new data appears confirming that
the economy is still expanding at a growth rate well above 2.0%.
<P>
<I>There is little disagreement at the Federal Reserve that the
preconditions for a revival of inflation are appearing.</I>  <I>The
dissension about policy centers on three questions.</I>  First,
is the third quarter slowdown in domestic final sales growth to
1.5-2.0% from 4.8% during the second quarter temporary or the
start of a prolonged trend?  Secondly, is government data understating
productivity growth and thus causing policy makers to be overly
pessimistic about the economy's optimal non-inflationary growth
rate?  Thirdly, if wages do accelerate further, will corporations
be able to pass on the cost hikes to consumers or will they simply
erode profit margins?
<P>
The answer to the first question will be provided by forthcoming
retail sales and capital goods orders data for September and October.
 The growth of consumer spending did slow sharply during the third
quarter (it appears to be 1.2% compared to 3.4% during the first
half) but it should not remain subdued if employment continues
to expand at a steady rate and consumers remain confident.  The
September Conference Board survey of consumer confidence is positive
on both counts.  It shows that confidence remained close to 112
for a second consecutive month during September compared to 100
in June.  Household perceptions of the job market also were very
positive.  About 27.0% said that jobs were plentiful compared
to 24.8% during June while only 20.8% said jobs were hard to get
compared to 22.0-23.6% during the second quarter.  <I>If resilient
consumer confidence produces a rebound in retail sales during
the autumn, real GDP growth will probably accelerate to the 3.0-3.5%
range during the fourth quarter from 2.0-2.5% during the third
quarter.</I>  Business fixed investment also should expand at
a 5.0-6.0% annual rate during the second half compared to 4.0%
during the second quarter and 11.6% during the first quarter.
 While the computer sector is experiencing a slowdown, the high
level of manufacturing capacity utilization rates, the 10-12%
profit growth now occurring in the corporate sector, and the high
value of American share prices in relation to asset replacement
costs should encourage other sectors to expand their investment
outlays.
<P>
<I>The current financial environment in the U.S. today is probably
more supportive of business expansion than any other in recent
years.</I>  The number of equity I.P.O.'s was 428 during the first
half of 1996 compared to 573 during all of 1995, 571 during 1994,
and a peak of 665 during 1993.  These I.P.O.'s raised about $27.2
billion during the first half of 1996 compared to $28.9 billion
last year, $22.9 billion during 1994 and $34.0 billion during
1993.   As a result of the stock market boom, the U.S. venture
capital industry will be able to provide entrepreneurs with almost
$4 billion of new capital this year or the highest level since
1987.  According to a recent survey by the National Federation
of Independent Business, entrepreneurs established  nearly 3.5
million new businesses in the U.S. last year.  While many of these
new businesses may employ only one person, the rate of new business
formation suggests that demand for labor will persist at high
levels if firms can actually find new workers.  If rising wages
and faltering productivity starts to depress profit margins, the
business sector could turn more cautious about new hiring and
investment.  But it is difficult to find such signs of caution
in either business surveys or the financial markets at present.
<P>
The major business risk in the outlook is the rising delinquency
rates on consumer debt and the pressure it is putting on banks
to impose tougher quality  standards on people being screened
for credit cards.  But as Fed Governor Larry Lindsey explained
in recent congressional testimony, it would be imprudent to over-generalize
about the dangers poised by consumer debt until the economy starts
to experience increasing unemployment.  Lindsey reported to the
Congress,
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>&quot;Consumer delinquencies on nonmortgage debt have increased
in recent periods and bankruptcy filing could well exceed one
million in 1996.  These developments have begun to affect profit
margins at some financial institutions and the Federal Reserve
has been closely monitoring these conditions and discussing their
implications with individual banking organizations and industry
groups.  In our view, given the generally strong financial condition
of the institutions most affected by these developments and that
the U.S. banking system, these adverse trends do not currently
present a material threat either to individual banking organizations
 to the overall banking system.&quot;</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
