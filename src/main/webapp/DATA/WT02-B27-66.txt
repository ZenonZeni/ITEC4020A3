<A NAME="Description"><HR></A> 
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Course Description</H3>

<P>This course will examine the literature concerned with research on teaching.  The main emphasis will be on understanding the problems and issues associated with conducting and interpreting this research, including its relevance to the improvement of educational practices.  The topics will be approached primarily from a psychological perspective with a heavy emphasis on how teaching relates to the psychology of human learning.   A general <A HREF="572Overview">overview</A> of the course will be distributed during the first class.  The course is designed for doctoral students in all departments who wish to study various issues related to theory and research on teaching -- master's students may enroll with permission of the instructor.  A basic knowledge of the psychology of human learning is assumed -- e.g., CEP 560 <B>or</B>  CEP 563 <B>or</B>  CEP 564 <B>or</B> equivalent.</P>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="Format"><HR></A>
<BR>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Course Format</H3>
<P>
The format of the course will consist primarily of seminar-type discussion.  Since the field has changes so dramatically during the past few years, an effort will be made to identify and define the theoretical, empirical, and practical issues associated with effective teaching.  Thus, the class will work jointly to identify issues involved in understanding the nature of teaching and its relationship to student learning, locate relevant articles, discuss the extent to which current knowledge of teaching and learning is capable of improving educational practices, and discuss ways in which future research on teaching might increase our understanding of effective teaching and learning from instruction.
<P>
The instructor will prepare five to ten <A HREF="http:572Questions">questions</A> each week to stimulate student thinking as they prepare for that week's class.  Students are expected to use these questions in preparing for the class discussion, but written responses to the questions are <B>not</B> expected.  Rather, they are designed for students to use in thinking about the readings and topic, and possibly in preparing their own questions for class, as described in the next paragraph.
<P>
Students are expected to prepare for each class meeting by reading the articles indicated for that day, reviewing the <A HREF="http:572Questions">instructors questions</A> for the week, and preparing their own questions on the assigned readings and/or the  topic being discussed.  Each student should write out at least five questions and bring them to class.  The main purpose of these questions is to facilitate class discussion by having students identify questions they would like to see answered during the discussion.  In order for me to adequately prepare for each class, I would like to receive a copy of the questions ahead of time; you either can send them to me via e-mail or see that I get a hard copy <B>before noon on Wednesday</B>.  In addition, a semester paper or project will be required.
</P>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<A NAME="Paper"><HR></A>
<BR>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Semester Paper</A></H3>
<P>
One of the major requirements for this course will be a paper or project to be completed by each student by the end of the semester.  Several alternatives are possible, although the paper/project must relate, in some defensible manner, to the issues and ideas contained in this course.
<P>
One possibility, to be discussed further in class, would be for a number of students (or the whole class) to create a Web page on the topic.  More traditional possibilities include a literature review and critique of the theory and/or research associated with a topic related to the course or a proposal for an empirical study that possibly could be carried out either this semester or next spring (although data collection is not necessarily part of the requirement for the paper).  Finally, you may have another idea in mind that would be appropriate for the assignment.  If so, be sure to discuss it with me early in the semester.
<P>
In fact, all students are encouraged to discuss their papers with me early enough in the semester so that my feedback will be available in sufficient time to take it into account in working on the paper.
</P>

<A NAME="Grading"><HR></A>
<BR>
<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Grading</H3>
<P>
Students may receive either a letter grade or be evaluated on an "S/U" basis.  You will be asked to indicate which system you prefer some time during the first half of the semester.  Grading will be based on the quality of the semester paper and other written assignments, as well as on the quality of class participation.
<P>
A grade of Incomplete ("I") will be assigned <B>only</B> if the student is making regular and reasonable progress toward mastering the appropriate criteria for a grade <B>and</B> if advance arrangements have been made with one of us for completing the course requirements within a reasonable and specified period of time.
</P>
