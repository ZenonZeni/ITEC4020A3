<H3><A NAME = "Storing">Storing Textbooks, Workbooks, and Other Materials</H3><P>

For books that must be easily available, teachers have found it helpful to
arrange areas on bookshelves.  By placing dividers about every 12 inches, books
can be easily put into the "cubbyholes."  Use plastic colored tape to code the
books by level or by subject area, so that matching their storage locations is
easy.  This same coding system could be used in other ways, perhaps to identify
materials for individual students.<P>
 
Workbooks with soft covers will survive longer if placed in plastic report
covers or if their covers are laminated.  Some report folders have a clear
front and solid back with a three-ring holder.  Have three holes drilled in the
workbooks so that they can be inserted in the folders easily.<P>

Books that are not currently needed are best stored out of the classroom.  It
may be possible to find a colleague who needs them.

<h3><A NAME = "Filing Worksheets">Filing Worksheets</A></h3><P>

Having access to a variety of worksheets can save the VE teacher a lot
of time.  But the key time-saver is having a system for filing so that the
worksheets can easily be retrieved.<br>
<i>Here's a system that works!  </i><br>
<br>
<p>Collect all loose worksheets and place all duplicate copies together in
individual files.  Take the original or best copy of each and number it
sequentially, so that each unique worksheet has a different number and there is
a numbered corresponding file folder with the duplicates.  <br>
<br>
<p>The originals can then be sorted by topic or skill and placed in three ring
notebooks.   You will have notebooks of worksheets for math skills, spelling
practice lessons, science concepts, etc. that you can scan easily to find just
the right one.  With the numbering system, you can go to your files and, by
matching the number, locate enough copies of the worksheets for your
students.<br>
<br>
<p>If you find that a worksheet fits in more than one category, just make enough
"originals" to place it in all appropriate notebooks.  If you are concerned
about putting holes in your originals to place them in the notebooks, put them
in the plastic sleeves that can be put in notebooks.</h3><P>

<h3><A NAME = "Learning Centers">Learning Centers</A></h3><P>

<p>Most teachers think of learning centers for elementary schools, but many
secondary teachers also find the concept very useful.  Learning centers are
used primarily to provide independent activities for students.  They can
provide a structured exploration of a specific subject, topic, skill, or
interest area.  The following are characteristics of a learning center:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A learning center is self-instructional.  When designed properly, no direct
supervision of a teacher is required.<br>
<li>A learning center can present activities on a variety of levels of
difficulty.<br>
<li>A learning center should have clear objectives.<br>
<li>A learning center must include some method of record keeping for student
participation and accomplishment.<br>
<li>Students need to be taught how to use a learning center.<br>
<li>A learning center should be considered as a place where learning occurs, not
as a place for recreation.  <br>

<h3><A NAME = "Managing Behavior">Managing Behavior</A></h3><P>

<p>The VE teacher must be able to manage the behavior of the diverse group of
students in the class.  <i>Behavior management is a system, method or technique
that enables students to understand and respond appropriately to school and
teacher expectations</i>.  A behavior management plan also helps students
become aware of their own need to belong by choosing appropriate behaviors to
achieve a special place in the classroom.<br>
<br>
<p>The purpose of establishing a sound behavior management plan in the classroom
is to enable students to be successful intellectually, socially and
emotionally.  Guiding and nurturing students in these areas enable children to
grow up to become independent, creative, problem-solving citizens.<P>

<h3><A NAME = "Behavior Management System">Behavior Management System</A></h3><P>


<i>How do you develop a behavior management system?</i><br>
<br>
<p>To develop a successful behavior management system, several steps should be
followed.  They include the establishment of a set of classroom rules,
guidelines for implementation, and, if needed, a well-defined set of rewards
and consequences.<P>

<h3><A NAME = "Establishing Classroom Rules">Establishing Classroom Rules</A></h3><P>

<i>How to Establish Classroom Rules</i><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Develop a maximum of five rules for your classroom.  Be sure they
correlate with school and district codes of conduct.<br>
<li>State the classroom rules positively.<br>
<li>Post the classroom rules in all four corners of the room on the first day of
school.<br>
<li>Include the classroom rules in a letter to parents and have parents sign and
return it to indicate their understanding and full cooperation for their
child's success.<br>
<li>Teach the classroom rules directly and review them for seven days, stating
the rationale and life value of each.<br>
<p>Some instructional activities that can be used include role playing or
dramatization, drawing pictures to illustrate the classroom rules, or
teacher-directed instruction to make sure that students can recognize and
demonstrate behaviors that follow the rules.  You may also find it helpful to
make sure that students recognize behaviors that do <i>not</i> follow the
rules.<br>
<li>Here are some examples of classroom rules:  <br>
</ol>
<pre>
	Give your best effort daily.
	Listen when the teacher or someone is talking.
	Raise your hand if you have something to say or to ask.
	Cooperate and get along with others.
	Complete all of your work. </pre><P>

<i>How to Implement Classroom Rules</i><br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Be consistent.  Set standards and expectations and follow them.<br>
<li>Follow through with rewards and consequences that are realistic and
appropriate.<br>
<li>Provide both positive and corrective feedback to students and parents.<br>
<li>Provide ongoing parent/teacher communication on a daily or regular basis
depending on the severity of problems and needs of individual students. <br>
<li>As needed, go back to "square one."  Reteach the classroom rules directly
and review them for several days stating the rationale and life value of
each.</OL><P>

<h3><A NAME = "Maintain the Momentum">Maintain the Momentum</A></h3><P>

<i>How to Maintain the Momentum (or How do I survive in this classroom?)</i><br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Whenever a student breaks a rule, use <i>verbal correction</i>.<P>
Example:  "Carol, I see you talking.  What's the rule about talking?"  Wait
for response.  "What will you do in the future if you want to talk?  Repeat
that one more time." (Student verbalizes rule three times.)  If student says
she forgot, child should read rule from the chart and write that rule three
times.  <br>
<li>Whenever a student breaks a rule and refuses to comply with your directions,
use the <i>broken record</i> technique.  The teacher repeats the rule concisely
until student cooperates. <br>
<li>Whenever the "broken record" technique doesn't work, use the <i>choice
technique</i>.  Offer the student a choice of two things he may do, both of
which are acceptable to the teacher. It's recommended that one of the choices
be obviously more appealing to the student.<br>
<li>Whenever choice does not work, remove the student from the group until he or
she can act appropriately.  This is a form of <i>time out</i> that keeps the
student in the classroom.  Advance the student through the steps only as
necessary.<br>
	Step 1: Move chair away from the group, but facing the group so the student
can observe appropriate behavior.<br>
<br>
	Step 2: Leave the student where he or she is but turn the chair facing away
from the group.<br>
<br>
	Step 3: Isolate the student from the group but within view of adult.<br>
	Step 4: Have student draw or write responses to three questions:<br>
<br>
<i>		What did I do that put me in time out?</i><br>
<br>
<i>		What am I going to do in the future so this won't happen again?</i><br>
<br>
<i>		What did I miss as a result of being in time out?</i><br>
<li>Assess the student's needs, interests, and behavior patterns and
jointly construct a behavioral contract that specifically states what is
expected of the student.<br>
<li>Contact the parents and get them to sign and support contract agreement.<br>
<li>As a last resort, send student to the office where another alternative may be
considered. <br><P>

<h3><A NAME = "RR for Students">R&amp; R for Students</A></h3><P>

To ensure a safe learning environment for all students, you may wish to
institute R&amp;R for students.  An area of the classroom is designated as
R&amp;R -- Rest and Return -- and is available to any students who feel the
need to cool down and collect their thoughts when their behavior has gotten out
of control.  Generally a two-minute stay in R&amp;R is sufficient for this
purpose.<br>
<br>
<p>If the student won't voluntarily go to the R&amp;R area, he or she is asked by
the teacher to put his head down on the desk for a specified time (e.g., three,
five, or ten minutes). <br>
<br>
<p>If the behavior persists or worsens, the student may be asked to leave the
classroom for a brief time and return when ready to participate.  If this is
required, it is recommended that someone, an aide or responsible student,
accompany the student to the alternative area.  Make sure that arrangements
have been made ahead of time for this type of crisis intervention.<P>

<h3><A NAME = "Keeping Track of the Students">Keeping Track of the Students</A></h3><P>

<p>On a paper attached to a magnetic board, the names of class members are listed.
When a student leaves the classroom, he or she places a single magnet next to
his/her name to indicate the reason for being out of the classroom for a short
period. These reasons may include restroom, mainstream class, therapy, etc.
When the child returns, the magnet is placed at the bottom of the list
indicating re-entry to the classroom.  This places the responsibility on the
students to manage their own coming and going in the classroom.  Additional
contingencies could be set up: for example, limiting the number of students
going out to the restroom at one time.<P>

<h3><A NAME = "Silent Signals">Silent Signals</A></h3><P>

Sign language can be used for general requests in the classroom.  There is a
signal students may use to sharpen their pencils, get a drink of water, or go
to the bathroom.  This decreases the problem of being interrupted while
conducting a lesson.  You can signal to the child to go ahead without stopping
your lesson with the individual group.  If you don't know sign language,
contact your district coordinator for hearing-impaired programs or your local
FDLRS Center.<P>

<h3><A NAME = "Rewards Consequences">Rewards &amp; Consequences</A></h3><P>

A <i>level system</i> can be used for behavior management.  The system must be
developed in conjunction with the classroom rules and behavioral expectations
for the students.  Positive reinforcement is provided for behavior that follows
the rules and meets the expectations.  <br>
<p>In most level systems, a <i>point system</i> is developed to provide concrete
indicators to students.  Points are awarded to students on a regularly
scheduled basis throughout the day or week.  For example, the classroom day may
be divided into 30-minute intervals and a timer set to notify the teacher and
students.  In secondary schools, regular class periods serve as convenient
intervals.  <P>

<p>Points may be awarded for each classroom rule a student follows, and
percentages may be calculated to determine how well the student is doing.  For
some students, the percentages may be calculated to show what percent of time
the student is following each rule.  For other students, the percentages may be
calculated to show what percent of the rules are being followed.   The rewards
are based on the percentages: the higher the percentage, or the higher the
number of days the percentage was reached, the higher the level of reward.
Generally, the levels and rewards are determined once a week, although a daily
schedule may be needed for some students.<br>
<br>
<p>Most teachers identify several behavioral levels for reinforcement.  The levels
are defined in terms of privileges that the student earns.  Privileges can be
adjusted according to the student's interests.  <br>
<br>
Level 1.  Student's behavior is appropriate less than 80 percent of the time.
<br>
	No privileges.  Student has no choice in activity or free time.  Student may
not attend outside activities or field trips.<br>
	<br>
Level 2.  Student maintains appropriate behavior 80 percent of the time.<br>
	Student may select art or music centers, manipulatives, computers, or other
free-time activity.  Student may attend outside activities and field trips.<br>
<br>
Level 3.  Student maintains appropriate behavior 90 percent of the time.<br>
	Privileges are the same as for Level 2, plus student may go to media center,
run errands, or be a peer tutor. <P>

<h3><A NAME = "Another Level System">Another Level System</A></h3><P>

Students "make their day" by earning a certain percentage of points.  Once they
make ten days, students earn a reward (snack out of classroom school store).
Students advance to the next level after earning ten days on the current level.
They are also able to earn pro-social points for appropriate pro-social
behaviors.  Each pro-social point is worth $.05 which can be spent in the
classroom store.  <br>
<br>
<p>Individual point sheets are developed for each student with targeted short term
objectives from student's IEP.  These sheets are updated every two months.
This helps the teachers, aides, parents, and students stay focused on the
instructional objectives.  Points are posted daily and discussed. Points are
tallied daily and recorded on a point sheet that is sent home for parent
signature and returned the next day.  <P>

<h3><A NAME = "Token Economies">Token Economies</A></h3><P>

<p>Token economies are often used in connection with level systems for behavior
management.  However, they can stand alone.  Here are some examples of
economies that have worked in VE classes.<br>
<br>
<p>Students <i>earn play money for following classroom rules</i>,
<i>participation, completing assignments, etc</i>.  Students may also be fined
when rules are broken.  If they don't have enough money to pay their fines,
they receive chips from the teacher.  The chips serve as an IOU.  A red chip
equals $1.00.  A black chip equals $5.00.  As students earn money later in the
day or the week, a student must first pay off his/her fines.  The classroom
bank is displayed on one bulletin board.  "Baggies" are kept on this bulletin
board with students' names on them to hold deposits and IOU chips.   Money can
be used to purchase items from classroom store which is displayed on another
bulletin board.  Money could also be used for classroom or department auctions,
McDonald's Certificates, or earning privileges.<P>

<h3><A NAME = "More Reward Systems">More Reward Systems</A></h3><P>


<b>More Reward Systems</b><P>
<p>Students earn $20 of<i> "good behavior money"</i> for every 10 minutes they
stay on task within the hour in the classroom.  An activity period is allotted
on Friday for good behavior money earned.  Good behavior dollars are produced
in neon colors in different currencies and bear the school logo. <br>
<br>
(from <i>Nanette Standfast, Pinellas County</i>)<P>
<p>To promote a positive behavior management system, students are given an<i>
A,B,C certificate</i> for good academics, behavior, or citizenship on which
they write their names.  At the end of class, students fold their awards in
half and place them in a box.  At least once a week a name is drawn from the
box.  This lucky student can exchange the A,B,C certificate for a tangible
award such as a small game, juice box, etc.  The A,B,C certificates reinforce
specific behaviors immediately and give students an opportunity to be drawn as
a chosen ticket.  The more A,B,C certificates earned, the better the student's
chances in the ticket drawing.  <br>
<br>
(from <i>Terri Partlow, Orange County</i>)<P>
<p><i>"Kind Acts and Good Deeds Jar" </i> Students have 10 - 15 name cards in an
envelope at their desk.  Whenever they do a kind act or good deed, they are
allowed to place their name in the jar.   This can also be used to reward
appropriate responses to bad situations.  Whenever they do their best to
respond to a negative situation in a positive manner, they whisper the
situation to the teacher and explain how they have tried to handle the
situation positively.  Examples:  ignoring rude comment, not hitting back after
being hit first, etc.  The teacher then asks students to place their names in
the jar for positive behavior responses.  Each Friday 3-5 names are selected
from the can for special recognition or reward.<P>
