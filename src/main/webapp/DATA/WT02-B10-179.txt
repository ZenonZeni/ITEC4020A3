In September, 1987, the National Institute of Mental Health in conjunction with the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) awarded a five-year research grant to establish the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies at the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (CPMC) in New York City. In 1992, the Center underwent a successful renewal process and was awarded another research grant from the National Institute of Mental Health for the next five years-February 1, 1993 to January 31, 1998.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The mission of the first phase of the HIV Center was to study all aspects of HIV infection in order to develop appropriate treatment and intervention strategies. In its second five years, the HIV Center continues to be dedicated to interdisciplinary studies on the prevention of sexual transmission of HIV, with efforts focused within the thematic context-Determinants of Sexual Risk Behavior and Model Interventions for Behavior Change-and targeting heterosexual women and men, gay men, children, and adolescents. Sexual-risk behavior and behavior change are tackled from many different perspectives: with both genders (exploring the gender-specificity of behavioral determinants), at different developmental points (childhood, adolescence, and adulthood), in various social contexts (the individual level, the couple level, the parent/child dyad, and social networks), with infected people and people at risk, among ethnically diverse populations, for special populations (depressed adolescent girls, homeless mentally ill men and women), and for different sexual orientations.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The studies on behavior focus on the elucidation of determinants that can be modified to increase safer sex. The intervention studies are clinical trials with relatively small samples, allowing detailed examination of a large number of determinants and identification of components critical to the success of larger programmatic interventions. Thus, the goal is to isolate key elements of behavior change that can subsequently be used by programs in local communities, nationwide, and internationally.

<B>HIV Center Cores</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The core and project concept that worked effectively during the first five years of the HIV Center has been retained.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Cores of the HIV Center are:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Psychosocial/Qualitative Assessment Core (Principal Investigator, Susan Tross, Ph.D.) </B>guides and advises HIV Center projects and assures that psychological and social theory and methods are kept sharply in focus in the design, implementation, and evaluation of research assessment. Issues of acculturation and transculturation are given special attention. The core played a major role in the development and leadership of several successful grant proposals that were developed and/or funded in 1994. Dr. Tross is a Co-investigator on the NIMH-funded HIV Risk in NYC's Homosexually Active Latin American Men, with Dr. Alex Carballo-Di&eacute;guez as Principal Investigator. A SAMHSA grant, Mental Health Services for Families Affected by HIV, is directed by Dr. Jennifer Havens as Principal Investigator. And the NIMH has also funded the AIDS Prevention Behavioral Consortium
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Psychosexual Assessment Core (Principal Investigator, Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, Ph.D.) </B>develops and provides instruments for the assessment of sexual risk behavior, oversees the quality control of assessments, and trains and monitors sex interviewers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Statistics, Epidemiology, and Data Management Core (Principal Investigator, Zena Stein, M.D.)</B> advises in the solution of design problems and analysis of project data, maintains an overview of multidisciplinary data, provides statistical review of manuscripts, conducts regularly scheduled clinics, workshops, and seminars, and oversees data entry applications, project management procedures, and quality control procedures. The core includes the Data Bank, coordinated and managed by Dr. Meyer-Bahlburg, resulting from the studies of disease progression among gay men and injection-drug using men and women that was begun during the first five years of the HIV Center.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Information Exchange Core (Principal Investigator, Patricia A. Warne, Ph.D.)</B> provides a mechanism for bidirectional communication between the HIV Center and professional and general communities locally, nationally, and internationally. The core comprises the Community Liaison Program, led by Joyce Hunter, the Media-Based Intervention/Education Program, the International Program, and the Professional Education/Information Dissemination Program. In 1994, the Media-Based Intervention/Education Program produced two AIDS-prevention public service announcements, one for adolescent/young adult women, and the other for adolescent/young adult men. Both will be aired on WNYC-TV and on Time Warner Cable of New York City in Spring 1995. Also underway is a project to develop and air AIDS-prevention/education radio spots for heterosexually active young African-American adults. The AIDS-prevention video, Breaking the Silence, developed with Latinas and taped in Washington Heights, premiered in 1994 at a reception for the community at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. The latest HIV Center video, Working It Out: Scenes from the Lives of Lesbian and Gay Youth, was produced this year and is being used by service providers working with lesbian and gay adolescents to effect HIV risk reduction behaviors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Ethics, Policy, and Legal Core (Principal Investigator, Ronald Bayer, Ph.D.)</B> collaborates with the Columbia University School of Public Health to bring together ethicists, <BR>
public policy experts, clinicians, philosophers, lawyers, and economists to serve the HIV Center by providing consultation to the research projects, initiating empirical studies on questions with an ethical or policy dimension, and providing an institutional context in which core members present their own ongoing HIV-related research on ethical, legal, and policy issues for critical review at monthly meetings.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>HIV Center Projects</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Determinants of Sexual Problem Behaviors in Childhood (Principal Investigator, Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, Ph.D.)</B> studies the emergence of sexual problem behaviors in children who are at increased risk for disruptive behavior/conduct disorders. The project adds onto a longitudinal project in the Lowenstein Center of the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry on determinants of disruptive behavior/conduct disorders among elementary school-aged boys who are the younger brothers of juveniles adjudicated in New York Family Court for personal or property offenses. Developing methods for the study of childhood sexual problem behaviors among both boys and girls, HIV Center investigators aim to identify predictors of sexual problem behaviors and to explore whether or not those factors also predict disruptive behavior/conduct disorders. Thus far, they have found that parent-child communication about sex seems largely limited to negative statements, and that many parents, uncertain about how to talk to their children about sex, express great need for assistance in this area. Results from this study will contribute to the development of programs to prevent sexual problem behaviors in childhood and early adolescence.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>HIV Risk and Coming-Out Among Gay and Lesbian Adolescents (Principal Investigator, Margaret Rosario, Ph.D.) </B>examines the developmental process of establishing one's sexual identity, the effect of that coming-out process on HIV-related and non-HIV-related risk behaviors, and the social norms and socially competent responses for negotiating safer sex and coming-out among adolescents who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. The first <BR>
data from the study indicate that these adolescents are at risk for HIV and that their coming-out experiences contribute to HIV risk behaviors. For example, over 40% of the adolescents self-identifying as lesbian reported having had at least one male sexual partner who injected drugs, had a sexually-transmitted disease (STD), was HIV-positive or had AIDS, or was gay or bisexual. Lesbians reporting at least one lifetime male sexual partner who was gay or bisexual were likely to have been rejected by their mothers or fathers for being lesbian. Thus, HIV prevention programs must target lesbian girls. This study will provide guidelines for tailoring HIV prevention programs to adolescents who are struggling with issues of establishing their sexual identity.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>AIDS Prevention for Girls in Therapy for Depression (Principal Investigator, Donna Moreau, M.D.)</B> has developed and will implement and evaluate a prevention program to delay the initiation of sexual activity and to eliminate or reduce HIV-related risk behaviors among high-risk adolescents-depressed Latino adolescent girls living in New York City. A central question in the AIDS prevention program is whether mothers can play a role in preventing sexual risk behaviors in their daughters, who are recruited from the Child Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In order to reduce the incidence of sexual behaviors that place women and men at risk for HIV and other STDs, the project <B>Sexual Risk Behavior Change in Heterosexual Women and Men (Principal Investigator, Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D.)</B> has developed and is testing an HIV/STD prevention program for heterosexual African-American, Latino, and Caucasian women who do not currently use drugs and who are of unknown or negative HIV serostatus. The women's study assesses barriers and facilitators of safer sex with an emphasis on issues of sexuality and gender, analyzing specific determinants of sexual risk behavior in the context of women's actual lives. Working with women recruited from a family planning clinic in Brooklyn, investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of eight- and four-session versions of a culturally sensitive intervention program. The study thus can test the validity and relevance of a theoretical model of HIV risk reduction. A qualitative, exploratory investigation has also been initiated with heterosexual men recruited from an STD clinic to identify gender-specific barriers to sexual behavior change and potential strategies for developing interventions for heterosexual men.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Primary Prevention for Male HIV-Serodiscordant Couples (Principal Investigator, Robert H. Remien, Ph.D.)</B> is a three-year study of 90 male couples having Puerto Rican and /or Anglo members who are of known discordant HIV serostatus. The investigators assess the contextual and psychological determinants of sexual risk behavior for both the couple and the individual in order to provide the foundation for a theory-driven intervention to reduce high-risk sexual behavior in this population.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
More than half the participating couples are discrepant in reporting risk behavior, and one-third disagree about what is risky. There are also ethnic differences in sexual behavior of Anglo and Puerto Rican men. In addition to reducing sexual risk behavior, the intervention under development will aim to increase and sustain mutual support and <BR>
care-giving and decrease adverse reactions to HIV in the relationship.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Having studied the determinants of HIV risk behaviors among psychiatric patients in the Fort Washington shelter for men in New York City, investigators of the <B>Critical Time Intervention to Reduce HIV Risk Behaviors Among Homeless Mentally Ill Individuals Project (Principal Investigator, Ezra Susser, M.D., Dr.P.H.)</B> have now proceeded with the development and testing of an intervention to reduce the frequency of unprotected sex among minority homeless mentally ill men. This population is mainly African-American and Latino, chronically ill, socially disadvantaged, and often afflicted by cognitive impairments that impede social learning. Thus, the culturally appropriate intervention is highly focused on one or two outcomes, uses skills training methods that have proven effective in schizophrenia, targets critical barriers to behavior change, takes account of the patterns of sexual relationships among these patients, and addresses the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and risky sexual behaviors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The past year has also seen the completion of an elicitation study among homeless mentally ill women and the development of a grant application to support an intervention trial in this vulnerable population.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Cohort Studies: Progression Of HIV Infection</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In addition to the cores and current projects of the HIV Center, several independently funded studies have arisen at CPMC that follow the cohorts of gay men and injection drug-using men and women assembled and studied by the HIV Center during its first five years. These include a program project on oral findings in HIV infection at the Columbia University School of Dental and Oral Surgery (Principal Investigator, Ira B. Lamster, D.D.S.) and a Dana Foundation drug trial consortium to study the treatment of HIV dementia and related cognitive disorders (Principal Investigator, Richard Mayeux, M.D.). Both of these programs are connected to the HIV Center with subcontracts (Principal Investigator, Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D.) to utilize the Center's Data Bank. Through these collaborations, the Center has maintained its links with clinical and basic science colleagues and has continued to address issues of disease progression, treatment, and care.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Training Activities</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Behavioral Sciences Research Training Program in HIV Infection (Program Director, Zena Stein, M.D.; Training Director, Robert Kertzner, M.D.) provides postdoctoral fellowship training for research on behavioral, mental health, and public health issues in HIV infection. The HIV Center is also the training site for four Aaron Diamond Foundation Postdoctoral Fellows, the most recent being Blanca Ortiz-Torres, Ph.D., who was awarded a fellowship to study gender scripts and safer sex among Latinas, under the mentorship of Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Stein directs an international training program in the epidemiology of AIDS in South Africa, supported by a training grant from the Fogarty International Center.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Conferences</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In July, 1994, HIV Center investigators attended the Second International Conference on the Biopsychosocial Impact of HIV Infection in Brighton, England, where they made 10 oral and eight poster presentations. In addition, Dr. Ehrhardt delivered a plenary address, Gender Risk Behavior and Intervention Programs For Women. At the Tenth International Conference on AIDS in Yokohama, Japan in August, 1994, Dr. Stein delivered a plenary address on methods women can use for HIV prevention, and Joyce Hunter moderated a panel, Reproductive Health and HIV/AIDS, and was an organizer of the Women's Satellite Conference for the International AIDS Society.
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B>Other Grant Support</B>
</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
HIV Center investigators have played a key role in the following grants:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Ezra S. Susser, M.D., Dr.P.H., is Principal Investigator and Heino Meyer-Bahlburg, Ph.D., Co-Investigator of a NIMH grant to study HIV risk behavior among homeless mentally ill men.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Francine Cournos, M.D., is Principal Investigator of a training grant from SAMHSA, HIV Training for Providers to the Severely Mentally Ill.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Susan Tross, Ph.D. is Principal Investigator of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-funded Lower East Side Health Project assessing the efficacy of a peer outreach/media distribution program for HIV-related condom use attitudes, intentions, and behavior in inner city women who are sexual partners of injection drug users. She is Co-Investigator of a grant from SAMHSA to develop and evaluate mental health services for families affected by HIV (Principal Investigator, Jennifer Havens, M.D.). Dr. Tross is also Clinical Director of the Comprehensive Care Center for Addicted Mothers and Infants supported by NIDA at <BR>
St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Dr. Alex Carballo-Di&eacute;guez was awarded a grant from NIMH to explore interethnic variations in factors associated with sexual risk behavior among Latin American men in New York City who have sex with men.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Current recipients of Aaron Diamond Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowships from the HIV Center are Claude A. Mellins, Ph.D (Mentor, Anke A. Ehrhardt, Ph.D.) to study stress, social support, and psychosocial functioning of HIV-infected mothers and children; Robert Klitzman, M.D. (Mentor, Mervyn Susser, M.D.) to study self-disclosure of HIV serostatus; and Paul Colson, Ph.D. (Mentor, Ezra Susser, M.D., Dr. P.H.) to study adherence to TB chemoprophylaxis among the homeless mentally ill.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Overall, the HIV Center strives to stay at the forefront of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, conducting research on heterosexual transmission, on ways women can protect themselves, on young people, on gay men who are at particularly high risk, and on populations with special mental health needs. The Center continues to serve as a resource for exchange with communities in New York, the United States, and many parts of the world.
