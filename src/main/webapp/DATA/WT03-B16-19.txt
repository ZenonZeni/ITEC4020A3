<H4>Reward strategy</H4>
<P>As the millennium approaches, so too does the political, monetary and legislative union of Europe. Companies that operate across European borders have long recognised the broad benefits of greater harmonisation, but how should they be shaping their reward programmes to make the most of the opportunities that integration brings? What should be the future direction of European people policy?
<P>To answer these questions, Towers Perrin is sponsoring a research programme that consists of:
<UL>
<LI>a two-day conference -- 'Reward 2000' -- to be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 6 and 7 March 1997
<LI>a major survey of reward practices among large European companies, the results of which will be presented at the conference.
</UL>
<P>'Reward 2000' will examine the theoretical, practical, cultural, organisational and business implications of European reward practices post-millennium. As such, it will be of particular interest to HR directors and managers, and compensation and benefits managers of European multinational companies and European subsidiaries.

<H4>Global pension assets</H4>
<P>As globalisation continues, foreign pension plan assets represent a growing share of total pension assets. For some multinationals, those assets can be comparable with the capital employed in the businesses, while their worldwide pension obligations often represent the largest liability on the balance sheet. And these foreign pension liabilities and costs are projected to grow dramatically in the future, fueled by:
<UL>
<LI>the ageing of the workforce
<LI>the privatisation of social security systems in many parts of the world
<LI>the growing number of countries enacting legislation that requires companies to provide a minimum level of retirement benefits or improve existing benefits.
</UL>
<P>A recent Towers Perrin survey of 30 major multinational organisations headquartered in the US examines how they are responding to the challenge of managing a rapidly expanding pool of capital that's certain to assume growing importance to their financial performance in the years ahead. Some of the survey's key findings are listed below.
<P><STRONG>Centralised co-ordination</STRONG>. While more than three-quarters of the companies studied have begun taking a co-ordinated approach and another 10% plan to begin centralised co-ordination very soon, a handful (about 13%) follow a decentralised approach with no headquarters involvement in managing pension assets outside the home country. Even in companies that are currently taking a co-ordinated approach, the drive to centralise global asset supervision is of relatively recent vintage. For example, more than a quarter of these companies (26%) have been focusing on their global pension assets for a year or less, and over half (52%) have adopted a co-ordinated approach within the last two to five years.
<P>Level of headquarters involvement. Headquarters staff are most directly and actively involved in three areas:
<UL>
<LI>asset allocation and asset/liability studies
<LI>investment manager selection
<LI>ongoing performance evaluation.
</UL>
<P>However, the level of involvement varies considerably from minimum to advanced. Taking asset allocation and asset/liability studies as an example, under a minimum approach, headquarters would require that local subsidiaries develop policies; under an advanced approach, headquarters would develop broad asset allocation guidelines and require local operations to adhere to them, unless they can demonstrate a need for variance.
<P>Degree of cross-border consolidation. One of the more promising areas of co-ordinated pension asset management lies in the potential efficiencies that can be gained from consolidating the custody of plan assets or the management of a company's global asset portfolio in a limited number of preferred global vendors. Interestingly, one-third of the companies studied are now considering multi-country custodial arrangements and conducting exploratory discussions with leading providers.
<P>In contrast, the movement towards consolidated investment management is already well established. Almost 80% of participants have either already consolidated all or part of their global investment management work with one or more firms or are currently in the process of considering or negotiating consolidated arrangements.
<P><STRONG>Looking ahead</STRONG>. A growing number of multinational organisations are now taking a more proactive approach in working with their foreign subsidiaries to manage their worldwide pension assets more efficiently. At the same time, however, headquarters staff are well aware of the barriers they face: cultural differences and resistance, tax and regulatory impediments, the lack of consistent information and poor communications with their subsidiaries in other countries. Over and above these, they cite the single biggest barrier as the lack of a clear mandate from senior management.
<P>Ultimately, the study suggests that those companies that are most successful in managing their global pension assets are those that have succeeded in establishing an open dialogue between corporate headquarters and local operations -- and have invested considerable time and effort in building cross-border partnerships and mutual trust within the organisation.

<H4>Superannuation industry reacts negatively to contributions tax surcharge</H4>
<P>The superannuation industry has reacted negatively to the tax surcharge on contributions to Australian retirement plans announced in the federal budget of 20 August 1996 (see Headlines of October 1996). The surcharge applies to employer contributions to a superannuation fund where an individual's total income (including superannuation contributions) exceeds A$70,000. It reaches its full 15% when income reaches A$85,000. This is in addition to existing contributions and benefits taxes.
<P>The concern is mainly because of the administrative burden the surcharge places on both funds and employers. The proposed collection mechanism for the surcharge involves a complex series of exchanges of information between the superannuation fund and the Australian Tax Office. The information will need to be exchanged for every member of every fund, even though the surcharge will not apply to the vast majority of members. It is therefore likely to increase administration costs.
<P>An alternative collection mechanism has already been proposed by the industry (represented by ASFA -- the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia), but was rejected by the government on various grounds.
<P>ASFA, the Institute of Actuaries of Australia and the two main accounting bodies are continuing to lobby the government for a revision of the proposed mechanism. Meanwhile, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the surcharge because, although it became effective from the date of the budget, the legislation is yet to be passed. Furthermore, its application to defined benefit funds is yet to be determined.

<H4>Salary management becomes a reality</H4>
<P>After decades of salary management in Brazil being driven by inflation and legislation, the environment seems to be moving more towards market practice and performance as drivers. This is demonstrated by a recent collective agreement covering banking staff that was concluded in September this year.
<P>Historically, salary increases in Brazil consisted of three elements: CPI, productivity and merit. The first two of these were guaranteed either by legislation or by union agreements. Although a presidential decree in July 1995 stipulated that prices and wages could no longer be index-linked (eg to CPI, the dollar exchange rate), most union agreements between then and the first half of 1996 still granted CPI-related increases based on the accumulated official inflation rate over the past 12 months.
<P>Many companies suffered economically in this period, as tough global competition did not allow them to increase their profits accordingly.
<P>The banking agreement, one of the two most important collective agreements, now bases salary increases on expected inflation over the next 12 months, instead of over the past 12. As well as representing significant savings to employers, not only on payroll but also on social and labour costs, this agreement indicates a change in the relationship between unions and employers' federations, and thus a trend to more focused salary management.

<H4>'Equal pay for equal work' ruling challenges individual approaches to remuneration</H4>
<P>A ruling made by la chambre sociale de la Cour de Cassation, the highest French court of appeal with jurisdiction over employment and social affairs, poses a serious challenge to employers' right to reward their employees on an individual basis. The ruling has the force of law and means that, in future, employers must be able to prove, by reference to objective data, that any differences in remuneration between employees 'in identical situations' are justified.
<P>In its 29 October 1996 ruling, the court stated that 'an employer must ensure equality of remuneration between all employees whose situations are identical'. In this context, remuneration is defined as all cash remuneration and perquisites, whether or not they are performance related. This is the first time that the court has used such a wide interpretation of the principle of 'equal pay for equal work'; previously, it has only been applied to issues of equality between male and female employees.
<P>Furthermore, the court has removed from employees the responsibility for proving 'unjustified discrimination' and has given employers the responsibility of proving that any differences in remuneration are justified. Before this ruling, employees had to prove that they were subject to unjustified discrimination if their remuneration was lower than that of their colleagues in identical situations. Providing that unjustified discrimination could not be proved, employers were allowed to award individual increases. In future, the ruling means that the existence of differences in remuneration will be taken as proof that employees are subject to unjustified discrimination, and employers will then have to prove that any differences are justified.
<P>The ruling was given in the case of Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Delzongle v Ponsolle. Madame Ponsolle, an executive secretary at Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Delzongle, based her claim on the fact that she received less remuneration for performing the same tasks than a colleague with the same job grading and a lesser qualification. The court ruled that the lower remuneration was unjustified and discriminatory.
<P>To override the ruling, parliament will need to enact legislation; this is unlikely to happen in the current session. Until the situation is clarified, employers should ensure that they are in a position to demonstrate that any differences in remuneration can be justified. The best way of doing this is by ensuring that their human resource management systems (job evaluation, competency-based pay, performance management, appraisals, bonuses) are well organised, clearly communicated and effectively implemented. Any of these systems can be put forward as justification for differences in remuneration provided that the employer can demonstrate that they are objective. Employees' job titles and collective agreement classifications should also be reviewed for consistency.

<H4>Proposed tax changes for cars and loans</H4>
<P>Employers will need to review their policies in the light of recently issued draft legislation on the taxation of company cars and employee loans. The employees concerned may well be subject to higher overall tax.
<P>The taxation of benefits in kind has historically been relatively unregulated in Italy. Consequently, companies have often adopted a variety of ad hoc approaches.
<P>Assuming the proposed rules are approved by parliament, which is likely to happen before the end of 1996, the effect will be to introduce a much needed uniformity of taxation methods.
<P><STRONG>Company cars</STRONG>. Under the new system, annual taxable income will be calculated as 30% of the value of a car according to published (ACI) rates, assuming the individual drives 15,000 km a year. Any contributions made by the employee towards the costs of the car will be deducted from the taxable amount.
<P><STRONG>Company loans</STRONG>. According to the draft legislation, taxable income will be equal to 50% of the difference between the interest that would accrue under the official interest rate (currently 10%) and the interest accruing under the terms of the loan.

<H4>Employment law amended</H4>
<P>Transfers of businesses must automatically be accompanied by transfers of all former employees, according to the Employment (Amendment) Act that came into force on 1 March 1996. The employees must also be given the same terms and conditions of service, including a retirement provision (if any) in addition to Central Provident Fund (CPF); and their period of employment with the previous employer must be treated as continuous with their service with the new employer. In addition, transferring employers must, in advance of the transfer, notify all affected employees and their trade unions so that there is time for full consultation.

<H4>Regulations governing foreign workers changed</H4>
<P>Foreign workers earning more than S$2,000 a month must now apply for an employment pass; an amendment to the Foreign Workers Act passed on 1 May 1996 has raised the previous threshold from S$1,500. The threshold excludes contributions to pension or provident funds; travel, food or housing allowances; overtime, bonuses and commission; and termination or retirement payments.

<H4>Trustee deadline moves closer</H4>
<P>Employers have until 5 May 1997 to notify trustees that they are putting forward their own proposals for the composition of pension plan trustee bodies. If any employer misses this deadline, the existing trustees must make their own arrangements for implementing 'member-nominated trustees' by 6 October 1997.
<P>Employers should take this opportunity to put forward arrangements that are appropriate to their business needs and can take account of existing arrangements with employee representatives. Failure to act means that the employer will be 'locked out' from putting forward its own trustee arrangements until 6 April 2003.
<P>The member-nominated trustee requirements under the Pensions Act 1995 mean that, whichever route employers decide to take, it is likely that there will be increased employee participation in the management of the pension plans. In addition, employees who are trustees must:
<UL>
<LI>be given 'reasonable' time off work to perform their duties as trustees and to receive training in respect of these duties
<LI>be paid during such time off at normal (or average hourly) rates
<LI>not be dismissed or adversely treated by their employer for performing their duties as trustees.
</UL>
<P>Complaints in connection with any of these matters may be taken to an Industrial Tribunal and, if considered unfair, employers may be required to pay compensation.

<H4>New unit trusts offer cross-border investment opportunities</H4>
<P>The Inland Revenue has taken the concept of cross-border pension funds one step nearer to reality by the introduction of a new form of unauthorized unit trust (pension fund pooling vehicles -- PFPVs) that may be established in the UK.
<P>PFPVs may be established by both investment management firms and multinational companies. Potential benefits of PFPVs include:
<UL>
<LI>Multinational companies may be able to consolidate their pension fund assets worldwide.
<LI>UK stamp duty is not payable within a PFPV or on transfers in or out of a PFPV.
<LI>Life assurance and non-life assurance fund management companies should now be able to compete on a level playing field, particularly in the area of index fund management.
</UL>
<P>The legislation is intended to allow participants in a PFPV who hold units to be treated for UK tax purposes as if they held assets directly. As such, PFPVs are intended to be 'tax transparent'. Participants in PFPVs can include:
<UL>
<LI>UK exempt approved schemes
<LI>overseas pension schemes that are locally tax approved and are accepted by the Inland Revenue.
</UL>
<P>Although, in principle, PFPVs represent a significant opportunity for both fund managers and multinational companies, as yet, none has been established. The investment management industry is currently waiting for a number of issues to be resolved before deciding to go ahead with the PFPV initiative. These include:
<UL>
<LI>Administration: many investment managers have commented that administering a PFPV is potentially very complicated. For example, when investors in different countries (with differing tax treaties) invest in a PFPV, it is difficult to apportion the correct (different) tax relief to each investor.
<LI>Acceptance of PFPVs by overseas tax and pension authorities: efforts are being made to convince local tax authorities of PFPVs' tax acceptability.
<LI>New international activity: similar pooled vehicles may possibly be established by overseas authorities to rival UK PFPVs.

<H4>IRS proposes to tax overfunded foreign pension trusts</H4>
<P>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed regulations that, in effect, would tax US multinationals on a portion of the earnings of the pension funds maintained by their foreign operations. The regulations would apply to all foreign plans providing deferred compensation (ie any compensation that is not paid immediately) that have assets in excess of the plan's liabilities (determined in a manner similar -- but not identical -- to that used in determining the projected benefit obligation [PBO] under FAS 87), as long as the plan is maintained by a foreign branch of a US parent company or by a foreign corporation at least 50% owned by a US parent. Plans maintained by foreign organisations without US parents are not affected -- unless they're maintained by partnerships that include a US partner.
<P>Specifically, the proposed regulations would require the US company to include in its taxable income the earnings on the portion of the assets in the foreign trust in excess of the plan's liabilities. The tax would apply even where the plan has received foreign tax approval and covers only foreign nationals. It would apply even though the company cannot get the use of excess assets.
<P>Foreign subsidiaries of US companies normally pay US income tax only when earnings are repatriated. However, passive income -- such as interest and dividends earned by the subsidiary -- is an exception to this rule. Passive investment income is deemed to be distributed annually to the parent, and the US tax is due even if those earnings are not actually repatriated. According to the IRS, the earnings on surplus assets in a pension trust normally would be considered such passive investment income and, thus, should be taxed currently to the parent of the foreign subsidiary.
<P>The IRS regulations do provide one exemption from this proposed tax treatment. That exemption would apply if the employer can demonstrate that the surplus is due to favourable investment experience and that all prior funding assumptions are reasonable. However, this exemption would be available only if it's claimed annually on a report filed with the IRS. The burden would be on the employer to establish that all of the plan's funding assumptions are reasonable.
<P>The IRS proposal, if adopted as is, calls for the regulations to take effect immediately -- that is, for taxable years ending after the date the proposal was issued (27 September 1996). For plans that have a surplus as of the valuation date immediately preceding 27 September 1996, the new tax treatment would be phased in over ten years, with one-tenth of the earnings on that surplus taxable in the first year beginning after 27 September 1996, two-tenths in the second year and so on. The IRS plans to conduct hearings on the proposal in January.
<P>In view of the IRS proposal, US multinationals with foreign pension plans should conduct a careful assessment of their tax risk. As part of this assessment, companies will need to take inventory of their foreign plans and determine whether the assets in each foreign plan exceed the PBO -- and, if so, by how much. Finally, companies will need to allocate the earnings of the overfunded plans between the full-funding liability and surplus portions to determine what would need to be included in their US taxable income and what the tax effect would be.
<P>For US multinationals that have already examined their foreign plans to determine whether they qualify for favourable tax treatment under Section 404A of the tax code (see Headlines of June 1995), it should be relatively simple to identify which plans pose possible tax liabilities due to surplus assets (since these will be the plans that typically don't qualify for 404A treatment). For companies that haven't taken a careful look at 404A's impact, this may be a good time to do so.
