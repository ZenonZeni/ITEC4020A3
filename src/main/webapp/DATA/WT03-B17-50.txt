<title>Resolutions</title>
<H1><center>I Resolve....</center></H1>
<p>	
The New Year is that time of year when we all set those unrealistic goals that we know we won't obtain, 
but which we feel obligated to set anyway.  Many people say they will lose weight, others say they will quit smoking, still others vow to give up a certain vice -- caffeine, alcohol, or sugar, for instance.  While we might attain these goals short-term, in the long run we usually fall back to our same old habits.  Why do we put ourselves through this?  Wouldn't it make more sense to set one, maybe two, realistic goals that we want to attain over the course of the year?  Some realistic goals might be:  to bring last semester's Spanish grade from a C to a B, to lose 5 pounds over the next 3 months (warning: this is only for those who are truly overweight, not for those who think being a little thinner would help), to cut back from 20 cigarettes per day to 15 in the next 3 weeks, with total withdrawal from nicotine a process that takes several months.  Get the idea?  The resolution solution is to not try to give it all up right away, but to work toward something attainable over time.<p>

<H2><center>Attainable Weight Loss</center></H2>
<p>
Weight loss is a funny thing.  So many people want it, yet so few people truly need it.  Ideal body weight differs from person to person, and depends upon such factors as bone structure, muscle mass, height, and genetic disposition.  Two people who weigh 140 pounds can look totally different depending upon their body make-up.  The trick is to objectively understand what is the most healthy body size, not weight necessarily, for yourself.  Many of us have trouble being objective about our body size, so ask a health care professional what would be healthy for you.  Chances are, if you need to do anything for yourself at all, it's tone up your body, not lose weight!<P>
If you do decide to lose some weight, plan to do it in a heathy manner.  Don't just stop eating!  Eat more fruits and vegetables; choose an orange instead of a cookie.  Also, drink 5 to 7 glasses of water per day.  The water will help you feel more full and will also help wash toxins from your system.  Plan for gradual weight loss, no more than 1 or 2 pounds per week initially, and then maybe 1 pound per 2 weeks.  Consider consulting a professional about how to best structure your food and activity choices to obtain the optimal weight loss program for yourself!<P>
Some "do nots" and "dos" in the weight loss arena:
<ul>
<li>Don't give up your favorite foods completely; just cut back a little!
<li>Don't skip meals.
<li>Don't eat and then take diuretics or laxatives to lose weight.
<li>Don't plan to lose too much weight.
<li>Don't lose weight that you don't need to lose!
<li>Don't fast with weight loss being the goal.
<li>Do plan body toning activities in addition to dietary changes.
<li>Do reward yourself for working toward goals.
</ul>

<H2><center>Making the Grade</center></H2>
<p>
Perhaps your desired goal for the New Year is a 4.0 grade point average.  Well, we can't say that won't happen, but we wonder if that's the best goal for you.  Yes, some people will get a 4.0, but not everyone.  The question is:  what is a realistic academic goal for you?<p>
Academic success is achievable. First, you must make a commitment to your studies.  Second, you must plan time to devote to those studies.  Third, you must know how to study for each course.  Fourth, you must vary your activities so study time is valued.  "What?" you ask.  Vary your activities?  Yes.  Participation in extracurricular activities can help you apply what you learn in the classroom, thus helping you understand more comprehensively.  Also, extracurricular activities help you stay focused...they give you an outlet so your mind can process what you learn in study time.<p>
<B><U>One:  Make a commitment to your studies.</U></B> That doesn't mean study all of the time.  That does mean making yourself accountable for your study time and class attendance.  Set your academic success as a priority.  Don't let other activities take precedence over your academics; rather, let other activities complement your academics.<p>
<B><U>Two:  Plan time to devote to your studies.</U></B>  Decide now when your study hours will be and don't let things interfere with study time unless absolutely necessary.  Devote enough time to studying.  Some professors suggest 3 hours studying per hour of class time.  Make sure you realistically look at your work and activity schedules.  Do you have enough time for your studies?  Can you block out study time each day?  Can you plan to study between classes and work?  Plan refresher sessions each week to highlight what you have done in study sessions for each course for each week.  Get the picture?<p>
<B><U>Three:  Know how to study for each course.</U></B>  Different disciplines require different study techniques.  For example, if you are accustomed to studying literature and are taking an applied science course, ask your professor the best means to study for the course.  You will need to change your study techniques!  Ask people majoring in the area how to study.  Check with the Counseling Center for study tips.  Think about tutoring or SI time to enhance your study skills. 
<B><U>Four:  Vary your activities.</U></B>  Exercise, work, socializing, and participation in organizations can help your studies.  These activities help you "round out" your life and realize success in many areas.  The trick is to not let these things over-ride your study time.  Enjoy your roller-blading for an hour, then settle in for study time.  Perhaps you have 2 meetings in an evening.  Can you study in between meetings?  Can you apply anything in any of your studies to the meeting?  Can you be okay with going to the meetings and participating, but then making sure you get back to your academics?
