<p><strong>International Applications</strong>
<P>
Most of this fast-growing market for PV is made up of people who lack a reliable source of
electricity&#151;about 40% of the world's population. Often, these people require only small amounts
of power for such applications as indoor lighting or pumping water, applications for which PV
electricity is often the least expensive and most reliable power alternative. 
<P>
To take advantage of this huge market, we must find ways to finance the purchase of PV
systems and establish reliable installation and maintenance services. In-country structures for
financing, installation, and maintenance usually have to be worked out country by country.
International lending agencies require assurances of a technology's performance before they will
grant a loan.

<font color="#F79D00">This member of the Vietnam Women's Union (VWU) is making her down
payment for a home PV system. In a joint venture with the Solar Electric Light Fund (SELF), the
VWU set up a revolving credit fund that enabled 100 homeowners in southern Vietnam to
purchase solar lighting systems in 1995. Over 80% of Vietnam's population is without
electricity.  (Photo: SELF)</font>

<BR CLEAR=all>
Over the next few years, we will address these issues by helping to conduct demonstrations and
to secure development loans from lending institutions. <a href="mexico.html">PV systems in Mexico</a> and Brazil are already demonstrating the benefits of <a href="hybridcase.html">small and village systems</a> for rural areas. Additional pilot projects are planned for India, China, South
Africa, Russia, and other developing countries.
