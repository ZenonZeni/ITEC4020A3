Benchmarking: How It Is At Deere
</H1>
<FONT SIZE="-1">
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>
I've been to John Deere headquarters in Moline, IL, perhaps half  a  dozen times, and frankly speaking there's really not much reason to go to the Quad Cities (outside of riverboat gambling, if one is thus inclined) except to visit John Deere. (I know, I'll get angry letters, calls, faxes from incensed Quadarians. But let's face it: The vast majority of them work for John Deere, in one fashion or another. A further testament: There are over 50,000 visitors to John Deere from around the world every year, and it's not because of riverboat gambling.)

<P>Benchmarking is what I've come to talk about--process benchmarking. How Deere does this. What they benchmark. Who they benchmark. What they look for. What they do with the information. And what can be passed along to those thinking about doing benchmarking, or perhaps doing it now, based on Deere's experience.

<P><I>This is why I'm in East Moline. There's a lot to learn. But what one takes away is less than one might have thought. As in plan, collect, analyze, and implement. Which requires some explanation...</I>

<P>But first this story: There's an interesting anecdote about the original John Deere, making plows in his primitive forge shop/plant, and taking them around to customers, asking them what he could do to make them better.

<P>According to the tale, a colleague asked him, &quot;Why bother, John? These folks are going to buy the plows whether you ask their opinion or not?&quot;

<P>It's not recorded exactly what John Deere said in reply, but what's fashionably now called &quot;continuous improvement&quot; and &quot;listening to the voice of the customer,&quot; apparently continued.

<P>And it does yet today. On this you can bet, well, the farm.

<P>It's not rocket science. Which is true. Benchmarking is not something mystical. It's not something you need to call in a consultant to get going (although there are plenty of those willing). It's really quite simple. But it does require considerable discipline. Including internal self-discipline.

<P>Okay, what does that mean? It means this: If you want to do benchmarking, you must know precisely what it is that you want to know--and you cannot know this without knowing--intimately and in detail--your own processes, those you hope to improve via benchmarking.

<P>That sounds pretty commonsensical, right? The thing is, it is. What's problematic is that most companies (1) don't have a good grasp of their processes (manufacturing processes, perhaps notwithstanding, as they by their very nature are and must be disciplined [which is not to say that these processes don't need attention]--how else do products go forward to the market?), and (2) without total understanding of one's processes, there is no hope for improving them. Further, this can only be done by process owners, the ones immersed in the process, the ones who are best in place to communicate the process, the ones best in place to make process changes and improvements.

<P>Think of it like this. You want to learn to ride a bike. But instead of mounting the cycle yourself, you hire a consultant. He learns the bike-riding process and hands the bike back, after riding around and around in front of you, and says, &quot;Here's the bike. That's how to ride it. Just do it like I did and you'll be fine.&quot; And off he goes. Now, can <I>you</I> ride the bike? Yeah, sure.

<P>The same is true of understanding processes. You want to improve one? Get those involved in the process directly 
involved in the process improvement.

<P>Finding the Best. &quot;How do I know who's best?&quot; That's a fair question, when thinking about benchmarking. You want to benchmark against the best there is--best in class, world class, whatever.

<P>You probably know who does what better than you in your own backyard--your own industry, segment, division, region. 
But how do you know who's best beyond that?

<P>Some common characteristics of world-class competitors: They know their processes better than their competitors do. 
They know the industry competitors better than their competitors know them. They know their customers better than their competitors know their customers. They respond more rapidly to customer behavior than do their competitors. They use employees more effectively than their competitors do. And they compete for market share on a customer-by-customer basis.

<P>So that's one way to identify who's best. Another is to look at who's winning awards, getting results. The Baldrige, for example. If you look at the 14 companies that have won the Baldrige as a division of a larger company, they've out-performed the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 by 4:1. And if you look at the five whole companies that have won, they've out-performed the S&amp;P's 500 better than 
by 5:1. There's something in this. It's called getting results--which is who you want to look to as targets for benchmarking partners. Companies bent on establishing themselves in global leadership positions--they're generally the best.

<P>Other ways to find out who's best: contact trade associations, other divisions within your organization, your own senior management. Or, you can contact organizations like the International Benchmarking Clearing-house through the American Productivity &amp; Quality Center (Houston, TX). The Clearinghouse is made up of 486 companies and it can assist in organizing and executing benchmark studiesincluding holding your hand (all for a price, of course) through the benchmarking process.

<P>Remember this, however: regardless how you search out with whom to benchmark, the process will only work if you keep two things in mind: that of being humble, on the one hand, and that of being wise, on the other. Humble--yes, humble enough to admit that someone (perhaps many someones) is better at what they do than you. And wise--yes, wise enough to watch closely, learn from what you see, so that you can do as well, and ultimately surpass what you see. 

<P>Part I: Plan. Don't do anything without a plan. Start by identifying what process you want to improve. Most of the time this will come from those doing the process (benchmarking at the process level rarely is initiated on high). Analyze the process as it now stands. And don't simply do a &quot;White Paper&quot; on the process. Because the Paper then becomes the goal, and when the Paper 
is finished (the research and analysis of the process all neatly documented and bound), it goes on the shelf and stays there, collecting dust, and everyone goes off, thinking, &quot;Gee, I'm glad that's done.&quot; When, in fact, nothing has been done (as improved). Nothing has changed. In fact, such an exercise adds no discernible value. Do not do this.

<P>When you've identified the process to be benchmarked, select the benchmarking team. As stated above, these team 
members must be process owners. They must intimately know the process, for when the team goes out (if it does), it must be able to articulate, as quickly and directly and clearly as possible, its own process and what it wants to improve to the benchmarking partner. Think: apples-to-apples. How do I know if I'm comparing comparable processes? Self-analysis and clear articulation--the two keys to getting oranges out of the equation.

<P>Note: It's at this point, the planning stage, where some benchmarking teams decide <I>not</I> to benchmark. Doing the analysis, the team may find that it doesn't know enough about its own process to begin to benchmark it. It may be premature. There may be more work needed internally before attempting to improve through outside comparison. Which is okay. Which is what the process is all about: Change. Implementation. Improvement.

<P>Another aspect of the planning phase can be internal benchmarking--sending the team to other divisions of the 
company with similar processes and talking to them about what they do. Two things are learned in this process: One, what the other division is doing around a similar process. Two, it gets the team into the &quot;inquiry mode.&quot; Keep in mind that most benchmarking teams are not permanent teams--they're put together of process people for a single purpose, the improvement of a process, and they can use the &quot;practice&quot; of asking process questions of others not familiar with the process they have ownership of. In other words, such internal benchmarking can serve as a dress rehearsal for the actual benchmarking activity. And in this it becomes a confidence-builder for the team.

<P>Part II: Collect. After you've gathered intelligence on your own processes, then start developing a survey designed to initially elicit from your partner what you need to do to improve your process and to gauge his willingness to participate. Keep this down to 5-10 initial questions (multiple-page surveys are daunting to those receiving them, are too time consuming [add no value to those responding], and tend to be not well focused.

<P>Once this is drawn up, get a list of prospective benchmarking partners and call them. Tell them what you'd like to do. Be specific. Ask if they'd be willing to fill out a survey (&quot;just 5-10 questions, nothing very time-consuming, really&quot;). If the answer is yes, they're hooked. Ask if you can fax the survey, and will they fax it back? This is how strategic linking begins.

<P>But wait. What's in it for the other guy? Let's say you've selected 25 top companies to survey. <I>You</I> know that you're going to winnow this to five to eventually benchmark with. What the other participants get is a summary of the 10-question survey filled out by all 25 companies. You don't have to analyze the summary. You only need to identify what your responses were, what their responses were, and let them do with and digest as they see fit the information from the remaining 24 companies (who are <I>never</I> identified--this is strictly <I>verboten</I> ethically).

<P>Once this has been done, you can now expand and broaden the number and nature of the questions. At this point, too, you can determine whether site visits are in order, or whether the actual benchmark can be handled in other ways (conference calling, for example. Benchmarking doesn't always mean plane tickets and bad food.). Site visits are typical when the process is a machine-type process, for example, something where actually seeing your partners' process is a real part of the value.

<P>Keep this in mind as well: Whether there's an actual visit or some other means employed, <I>both</I> parties expect to receive value in the process. Benchmarking, if nothing else, is a two-way street named <I>Information Way</I>. You have to give and share, honestly, openly, if you expect to receive in return the same honesty and openness--and ultimately process improvement. 

<P>Part III: Analyze. So you've harvested the data. You've made the site visit(s). You've watched your partners' 
processes. You've determined the nature of the process &quot;enablers&quot;--those things that give your partners' processes an edge.

<P>Now you've come home. Now you begin to analyze what you've got. You write it up. You pass it around. You discuss what you've seen. You dissect it. You make recommendations for change.

<P>But in the back of your mind think this: processes across an industry, or across diverse industries, for that matter, may, indeed, be similar, and thus adaptable. Cultures, however, are not. Benchmarking, unlike reengineering, does not start with a &quot;clean sheet.&quot; There are cultural issues to consider when doing an analysis for change. There are environmental factors. Is the organization unionized? Are there organizational or structural issues that may serves as barriers to new processes enablers? These issues must all be resolved during the analysis phase.

<P>At bottom here is taking what you've learned and finding a way of &quot;fitting&quot; it to the existing culture. And this is a process of adaptation. After all, one doesn't benchmark processes to effect cultural change (which is what reengineering is all about). Which is not to say, however, that the implementation of a sleeker process won't impact the culture. It will. Positively.

<P>Part IV: Implement (Improve). Without this, it's all academic. If you research, go out, gather, come back, and then don't act, you've wasted your time--plus the time of your partner. At this point you must take the results of your analysis, your collected recommendations, and implement the process improvement enablers. Then set goals (realistic and stretch), and track progress.

<P>But you don't do this in a vacuum. Return to your partner to verify your progress and to absorb any process evolution there. After all, since the initial benchmarking took place, perhaps six months may have passed. And if you're benchmarking a true leader, they've not been standing still, either. Their processes have continued to evolve, and in this sense, the benchmarking never ends.

<P>Little Boxes. Little- (or big for that matter) box thinking will kill you--even if you're already 
<I>doing</I> bench-marking. What do I mean by that? I mean that, sure, it makes sense to benchmark against the best valve manufacturers if you manufacture valves. But does that mean that the best valve manufacturers--because they are the best--have the best processes--in say, order fulfillment? Or in service? Or in accounting? Or in distribution?

<P>An example: The airlines wanted to find out how to more quickly &quot;turn&quot; an aircraft (the time between when a plane lands, is emptied of passengers and baggage, is cleaned, refueled, boarded with new passengers, and is again, ready to fly). This generally takes 45 minutes to an hour or so, and to shave five or 10 minutes off this would make an incredible difference--in terms of on-time arrivals and departures and customer satisfaction.

<P>To whom did the airlines turn for benchmarking? To Indy car pit crews. The processes, albeit different in scale, 
have remarkable similarities.

<P>The message: If you make valves, and you want to benchmark the order fulfillment process, don't be confined by your own little (or big) box. Look outside, to whomever is best at order fulfillment, even if that should be Frito Lay or PepsiCo.

<P>Codes of Conduct. Yes, there is a code of conduct in benchmarking. And if you violate it, the word gets around pretty fast. Actually, it's what you'd expect of good neighbors or partners. For example, you don't talk about competitive issues. You don't try to form monopolies. You don't try to steal one another's employees. Be honest. Up-front. Open. Tell no lie.

<P>Bleeding Edge vs. Leading Edge. The difference here is that bench-marking allows you to be part of the latter and not the former. You want to learn from a company that's already done what you now want to do, only you want to take it further and do it better.

<P>And this is a fact: If you benchmark against just one company, you can improve by the degree of what you've learned in this single instance. But if you benchmark against three or five companies, you can take those three or five different process enablers, combine the best, tailor them for your culture, and end up with a better process better than any of those you benchmarked against.

<P>Which is the way it's supposed to work. Which is why others will want to benchmark with you.
