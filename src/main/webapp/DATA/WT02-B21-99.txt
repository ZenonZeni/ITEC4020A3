"I cannot imagine a more knowledgeable nor more pleasant staff than that which Zegrahm Expeditions provided.  I anticipate joining you again soon and have already convinced my husband, among other "recruits," that there is simply nothing on this planet that compare to what you have to offer.  Be sure to mail me results of your "recci" trip to Norway as it sounds intriguing."<BR>

"My ‘Safari of a Lifetime’ in Madagascar was an excellent adventure - the fascinating and exotic lemurs, the unusual birds and chameleons, and the friendly people!  The exploration of the island with Pete and Renee was exciting and fantastic...."<BR>
B.G. - California<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"What an amazing (Asmat) adventure we all had, my mind is still flooded with memories of the people and places - single threads interwoven into a rich tapestry.  A kaleidoscope of vivid impressions, textures, colors, sights, sounds, scents, tastes and feelings.  Such an educational and enriching experience, that will be with me for a long while to come."<BR>
L.B. - California<BR>

"The wonder and beauty of this adventure may best be measured as four to seven rolls of film per day, but the care and planning by Zegrahm staff goes beyond all rules of measure.  P.S.  Puffins are reported to eat fish, but they gobble up photo film!"<BR>

"The Ultimate Antarctica trip was that and more because of the very fine service given by your staff and the Russian staff and crew.  Your choice of the ship (and helicopters) was a pleasant surprise.  Zegrahm’s thoughtfulness from the very beginning was beyond my expectations.  From now on my travels are with Zegrahm."<BR>

"(Seychelles, Madagascar, Comoros & Zanzibar) was a most excellent voyage!  We had unforgettable experiences!  All, really all of the great staff deserve a "AAA" - Mike and Sonja, Jack Grove, Peter Harrison and Shirley Metz, Pete Oxford and Reneé Bish....The crew and the captain were excellent, the ship was very good.  All excursions - on sea (snorkeling!) and on land - were fabulous, and Lynne was most efficient too, when we met her in Dar es Salaam."<BR>

"Having just returned from your Antarctic expedition I have nothing but praise and commendation for the way the entire trip was handled.  The landings and shore trips were expertly and efficiently planned and executed - the staff members were superb and the lectures excellent.  It was a delightful adventure and thank you!"<BR>

"Back in New York after an incredible adventure in Indonesia.  The boat, the crew, Sonja, Mike... and of course Tobias enriched the trip tremendously.  Bravo!  Next time.... Antarctica!"<BR>
C.S. - New York<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"Norway, Franz Josef Land and Spitsbergen I will never forget.  An experience far beyond my expectations.  I made it a point to really "take it in" - every phase, every single day.  Nature as I have never seen or experienced before.  The wonderful polar bears, seals, walruses and the multitude of birds.  The sea, the ice, the superb leadership, the lecturers disseminating so much information and knowledge.  Every member of the organization giving her or his best.  Very impressive."<BR>

"I have to tell you that my (Galapagos) expedition exceeded all my expectations.  The Galapagos Islands are indeed "enchanted" but our leaders and guides made the trip the marvelous experience it was....Now I’m preparing to depart for ‘Round Britain and can’t wait to see my dear friends, Peter and Reneé, Peter and Shirley, and Mike and Sonja.  What a wonderful world of shared experiences Zegrahm is creating!"<BR>

"Jeanne and I feel that Zegrahm has a WINNER in the Kimberley Expedition, and want to thank you for your effort in making our expedition a truly wonderful experience..  The scenery  from the air, sea and the land was truly outstanding.  We continue to marvel at the waterfalls and the rock formations and colors.  It was greater than we had expected and the various wildlife  we viewed (turtle nesting in the daytime) was a big plus.  The adventure of getting to the various places made it even more of a thrill!  We loved the trip and the Zegrahm and Coral Princess crew and staff made it one that we will always remember.  You keep establishing expeditions like this and we will keep coming!!!!"<BR>

"Thank you for a wonderful adventure to the Antarctic this past January.  It could not have been any better or more educational.  Your staff was terrific.  Peter and Shirley, Sonja and Mike, Conrad and Carmen, and John Splettstoesser....you have a group of people one can be proud of!  We felt very well cared for not just on the ship but with our air connections and luggage.  In the future we will travel with Zegrahm when we really want to learn and experience.  Thank you much!"<BR>
