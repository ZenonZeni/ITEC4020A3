<p><font size="4">Cops view of the 'drug war'</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>San Francisco Examiner - April 9, 1995</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">Even from a purely Political viewpoint, you'd
think the Clinton administration's insistence on prosecuting most
of its &quot;war on drugs&quot; through law enforcement rather
than prevention and treatment was a bow to police chiefs and
other defenders of the criminal justice system.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">That's why research undertaken by Joseph
McNamara, former police chief of San Jose, is especially
startling.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">McNamara, now a research fellow at the
conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University, surveyed
nearly 500 police chiefs, police officers, district attorneys,
public defenders, lawyers, judges and Stanford students. Except
for the police, who hail from across the country, they live in
Northern California.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">He found that 95 percent of the police officers
believed the United States was losing the war on drugs, and 98
percent thought drug abuse was not primarily a police problem.
Just over 90 percent of the cops said increased prevention and
treatment could control drugs more effectively. More than 30
percent of the cops said that legalization or decriminalization
would cause a decrease in drug use or else not affect it.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A majority of a those surveyed said the answer
was not more military intervention, prisons, police or
prosecutors.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">This newspaper has long urged a change in
national drug priorities. More money needs to be spent on
prevention and treatment. Less money should be blown on exotic
enforcement boondoggles. Harsh prison sentences for minor drug
offenses waste private lives and public money.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">So, what gives with President Clinton and Lee
Brown, his drug czar?</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">During the 1992 campaign, Clinton promised to
reverse the emphasis of President George Bush's 'war on drugs,'
which waged battles using law enforcement &quot;soldiers&quot;
with two of every three drug-fighting dollars. Included
were-costly but inept crop eradication programs in foreign
countries and high-tech drug interdiction along U.S. borders.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">As president, however, Clinton tapped his $14
billion-a-year drug war chest for about the same small portion
for prevention and treatment.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Drug czar Brown has been nearly invisible. He
claims drug use in America has declined markedly, but other
evidence just says no. One in five state prisoners across the
country has been convicted of a drug offense. Crack cocaine is
smoked openly on some city streets. One-quarter of U.S. high
school students said they had been offered, sold or given drugs
on campus.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">With a tin ear to the real solutions, the
government pursues its outdated, expensive and ineffectual drug
war. &quot;Elected officials think it's political suicide to be
'soft on drugs,'&quot; says McNamara.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">A taste of the climate: &quot;If social
spending prevents crime,&quot; says Phil Gramm, senator and GOP
presidential aspirant, &quot;why is America not the safest nation
on Earth?&quot;</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Perhaps Gramm should ask some cops, then share
the news with Clinton.<br>
