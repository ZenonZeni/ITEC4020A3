<h1><font size="3">FED PANEL SAYS VALUE OF WORKPLACE DRUG TESTING
UNPROVEN</font></h1>

<p><font size="3">Forensic Drug Abuse Advisor Vo. 7 (1) January
1995, p.6</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Subcommittees of the National Research Council
and the Institute of Medicine have completed a study assessing
the extent of drug use in the workplace, and the impact of drug
abuse on job performance. Drug testers may be a little upset by
some of its conclusions, since the study raises important
questions about the scientific rationale for workplace drug
testing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Workplace drug testing is a very big business.
The study group estimates that the United States is spending at
least 1.2 billion dollars per year on drug testing (24 million
tests per year at an estimated total cost of $50 each), not
counting any money spent on time lost from work attributable to
the testing process. Statistical evidence from a variety of
sources suggest that, except for alcohol, drug use in the
workplace has been steadily decreasing for the last 15 years (the
percentage of heavy drinkers in the population appears to be
unchanged). In 1990, the overall rate for workers admitting to
having used an illicit drug some time during the preceding month
was 7%. However, today in some areas, such as the air transport
and nuclear industry, the rate is well below 1%.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">No study has ever demonstrated that this
decrease is due to the work testing program, nor has it been
demonstrated with any certainty that, in commonly used doses, any
of the widely abused drugs significantly impacts on job
performance. There is, however, good evidence that drug users are
more likely to be absent from work, and there is also good
evidence that alcohol abuse is associated with increased
occupational injuries.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The committee felt that much of the data
reviewed for its report was flawed, or at least of dubious
statistical power, and they concluded that &quot;the preventive
effects of drug-testing programs have never been adequately
demonstrated.&quot; As Craig Zwerling pointed out in a recent
issue of JAMA, Journal of the American Medical Association (272
[18] 1467-1468), the conclusion reached by the study group was
the same as that reached in a 1992 study, namely that there was
&quot;almost no credible warrant of effectiveness.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Zwerling also went on to note that &quot;a
large industry of drug testers has arisen with a financial stake
in expanding the market for workplace drug tests. The industry
includes the companies that manufacture the equipment and
chemicals used in drug testing, the laboratories that carry out
the test, the companies that collect the urine specimens, the
medical review officers (MRO's) who review the test results, and
the consultants who advise companies on drug testing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The study was sponsored by NIDA (National
Institute on Drug Abuse) and the results have been published in
book form by the National Academy Press. The full title is
&quot;Under the Influence? Drugs and the American Work
Force,&quot; Normand, J, Lempert, R, and O'Brien, C eds.
(Committee on Drug Use in the Workplace, National Research
Council / Institute of Medicine). 321 pp $39.95, ISBN
0-309-04885-0</font></p>

<p><font size="3">COMMENT: This book should be required reading.
Somebody has to do the studies to prove that the whole process
works. But who is going to put up the money to do the studies?
NIDA has just as big a vested interest in maintaining the status
quo as the drug testing companies, and the reagent manufacturers.
In fact, it may be too late to ever do the studies that would
justify the money and effort being spent on these programs. </font></p>
