<CENTER><H1> Some RCE Vehicle Production and Sales Numbers </H1></CENTER>

<P> In 1973, Mazda sold 104,960 cars in the US, twice the previous
year's total.  More than 92 percent had rotary engines.


<P> A total of 474,565 first generation RX-7 were produced (from X605
through P132) from 1978 through July 1985.  Almost 80 % or 377,878 were
exported to the US.  By 1990, a million RX-7s had been produced.

<P> If anyone has how many of each model was produced for ANY year, that 
would be interesting.  I only know they made 1500 10th Anniv. models and 
I think only 500 Yellow '93 R1's.

<P> I spoke with someone at Mazda last year and was given the total 
production #'s for the 93 intro year of approx. 20,000 worldwide.
Of the 20,000 93 RX7's 1,800 R1 packages were produced worldwide.

<P> Is the figure that was posted accurate only 5,000 odd rx7's sold in the 
U.S. of the 93 model year. WOW, that means approximately 550 R1's in the 
US. cool that could make it worth some money in the not too distant future.
I don't remember which one but some magazine recently published a list of 
cars likely to be collectors items in the future. The 93 RX7 was one of 
them, one of the only Japanese cars to potentialy increase in value, the 
numbers explain why.

The Japan Times reported on Feb. 20, 1996 that production of the RX-7
totaled 5,200 units in 1995, and an additional 330 rotary Eunos Cosmos
were produced.
