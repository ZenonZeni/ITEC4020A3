Hitachi to Market Wide Angle TFT LCDs


   Hitachi, Ltd. <6501> has produced a television and personal
computer monitor application prototype 13.3in TFT type LCD
featuring an angle of visibility of 140 degrees, both
horizontally and vertically. Sales are to begin from mid-1996.
The new display has a depth of 21.5cm, half that of a comparable
CRT, and provides high-precision video images with no line
flicker. The price has yet to be announced.

Profit Increases for March Term at 2 Bearing Manufacturers


   For 2 manufacturers of steel balls for bearings the outlook
for the March 1996 term is for profit and income increases due
to increased demand from makers of household appliances and
small PC peripherals.  Current profits for Amatsuji Steel Ball
<6475> are expected to show a 30% increase over the previous
term to 3.4 billion yen while Tsubakimoto Precision Products
<6477> is expected to show a 26% increase to 2.7 billion yen.
The two companies, due to their no debt management style, will
show financial income with decreased profit margins due to the
reduction in interest rates while securing profit increases as a
result of rises in operating rates and rationalized
manufacturing processes.  For Amatsuji, there will be increases
in shipments of steel balls for industrial arts equipment as
well as export increases to SE Asia in addition to its PC
shipments.  Gross sales are expected to increase 9% to 20.8
billion yen while sales profits are expected to expand 43% to
3.2 billion yen.  For Tsubakimoto Precision Products, exports to
Europe and ball screws for industrial arts machines are expected
to increase.  With gross sales increasing 10% to 14.5 billion
yen sales profits are expected to show a 31% increase to 2.4
billion yen.

NEC Consigns Sparc Production


   NEC <6701> will produce Sun Microsystem's Sparc, the RISC MPU
hearts of such items as workstations.  This consignment is
linked to increased orders of ASICs for Sparc.  NEC will acquire
Sparc design data and manufacturing technology from Sparc
Technology Business, Sun's semiconductor division.  The company
plans to start production of low- cost, 64b RISC MPUs for Sparc
WSs at its Kumamoto facility in 1996.  Monthly output will be
several thousand, 8-inch silicon wafer conversions.  NEC hopes
that with the consigned technology the company will accumulate
the necessary capabilities to fabricate peripheral ICs and
expand ASIC operations.

Hitachi to Enter Full Production of Semiconductors in SE Asia


   Hitachi <6501> is getting into Malaysia with a South Korean
semiconductor maker, the first time Japanese and Korean
companies are doing so, and into Singapore with Nippon Steel
<5401>, that company's first overseas semiconductor venture.
Total investment, including construction of pre-assembly
factories for semiconductor fabrication, hovers at the 230
billion yen mark.  Production of 16Mb  and 64Mb DRAMs will begin
in 1998.  The facility in Malaysia will give Hitachi integrated
production capacity there, since the company already operates a
local plant for pre- assembly processes, and will reinforce the
company's supply capabilities in the rapidly growing
semiconductor markets of Southeast Asia.

New Line for Nikon Film Scanners


   Nikon <7731> has embarked on increased production of film
scanners, which transfer images from film to PCs.  A new line at
the company's Ibaraki-based lens subsidiary will help boost
monthly output to the 3,000- unit level in January.  Nikon is
faced with a hollowing out of camera operations, as camera sales
falter and the company shifts production overseas, but
skyrocketing growth in PCs and peripheral equipment has
reinvigorated domestic operations.  The Ibaraki plant, with
about 1,000 employees, had transferred lens operations to a Thai
facility, but the investment of several tens of millions of yen
has allowed the subsidiary to branch out into not only scanner
production to complement new, semiconductor stepper activities.

Apple's New Production Line Just for Japan


   To stop the drain on profitability in Japan because of cost
competition, Apple Computer is about to totally revamp its PC
supply structure for the Japanese market.  The company will
introduce Japanese staff into the head office R&D unit, in
addition to a special production line at the Asian production
locus, in Singapore.  Japan is Apple's biggest market outside of
North America, but the company has been experiencing increased
competition since Microsoft's debut of Windows 95.  The
revitalized R&D and production structures, supported by people
who know the Japanese market, should facilitate quicker Apple
response to market needs and thereby buoy profits.
