<h2 align=center>Routine Fertility Workup</h2>

The following is a listing of tests generally included in a routine 
fertility work-up.  Please note that every reproductive endocrinologist 
(RE) has his or her own standard protocol, and the following is intended 
to be a basic guideline. <p>
 If you are not seeing an RE and your OB/GYN does not have the 
facilities to conduct these routine tests, you should seriously consider 
switching to a doctor who does.  Minimally, a doctor treating fertility 
patients should have the following:<p>
1. <b> Availability of staff and technicians seven days per week.</b>  If your 
doctor or clinic does not offer weekend and holiday hours, you are 
clearly not in the hands of someone whose priority is helping you get 
pregnant.  <p>
2.  <b>Transvaginal ultrasound equipment.</b>  You should not undergo clomid, 
metrodin or pergonal treatment unless this equipment is available for 
routine monitoring.  Though many OBs prescribe Clomid without doing this 
monitoring, it is in your best interest to have periodic ultrasounds to 
ensure that the Clomid is indeed stimulating ovulation and that the 
follicles are releasing the eggs. Under no circumstances should a patient 
undergo metrodin or pergonal treatment without ultrasound monitoring. If 
you are using intra-uterine insemination (IUIs), ultrasounds are required 
for accurately timing insemination with ovulation.     <p>
3.  <b>An on-site, certified lab</b> to do semen testing and prep for IUIs and 
post coital tests, as well as facilities to do E-2, blood HCG beta and 
progesterone tests.<p>

<b>YOUR FIRST APPOINTMENT: </b>  Try to schedule your first appointment with 
your RE during the first week of your cycle.  This will enable him/her to 
take baseline levels of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH 
(lutenizing hormone).  Most REs also do routine screening of both 
partners---AIDS, hepatitis, etc.  Medical histories for both partners 
will be taken.  Try to keep track of the length of your menstrual cycles 
for several months beforehand.  Charting Basal Body Temps (BBTs) for 
several months will also give your doctor some insights---as will using 
home Ovulation Predictor Kits and recording the results.<p>

<b>YOUR SECOND APPOINTMENT:</b>  This appointment should be scheduled on the day 
of LH surge---BEFORE ovulation.  In most cases, you will be directed to 
use home ovulation test kits and call for an appointment on the day you 
detect a surge.  Included in this exam will be:<p>
<b><a name="mucus">CERVICAL MUCUS TESTS:</a></b> including a post-coital test (PCT) to see that 
sperm can penetrate and survive in the cervical mucus, and a bacterial 
screening.  It is important to note that the appropriate time to do PCTs 
is just before ovulation when mucus is the most "fertile." PCTs at other 
times may give false results.  <p>
<a name="ultrasound"><b>ULTRASOUND EXAM(S):</a></b> On the day of LH surge are used to assess the 
thickness of the endometrium (lining of the uterus), monitor follicle 
development and assess the condition of the uterus and ovaries.  If the 
lining is thin, it indicates a hormonal problem. Fibroid tumors can often 
be detected via ultrasound, as well as abnormalities of the shape of the 
uterus and ovarian cysts. In some cases, endometriosis can also be 
detected.  Many doctors order a second ultrasound two or three days after the first.  This second 
ultrasound confirms that the follicle actually did release and can rule 
out lutenized unruptured follicle (LUF) syndrome---a situation in which 
eggs ripen but do not release from the follicle.<p>       
<a name="hormonetest"><b>HORMONE TESTS:</b></a> if the blood test at your first appointment indicated 
a high LH to FSH ratio, an indication of polycystic ovarian disease 
(PCOD), your doctor will order an "Androgen Panel" to check levels of 
free testosterone and dihydroeprandrostone (DHEAS).  Other tests tests that should be conducted on the day of LH surge include LH, FSH, Estradiol and Progesterone.  
Tests which can be done at any time (and therefore done at the second 
appointment) include:  Prolactin, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Free 
T3, Free Thyroxine (T4), Total Testosterone, Free Testosterone, DHEAS and 
Androstenedione.  <p>

The normal hormone levels for each of these during specific parts of your 
cycle are as follows:<p>

Lutenizing Hormone (LH)  <br>
    <dd> Follicular Phase (day two or three): <7mIU/ml
    <dd> Day of LH Surge:  >15mIU/ml<br>
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)<br>
    <dd> Follicular Phase: <13mIU/ml
    <dd> Day of LH Surge:  >15 mIU/ml<br>
Estradiol<br>
     <dd>Day of LH Surge:  >100 pg/ml
    <dd> Mid Luteal Phase (seven days after O): >60 pg/ml<br>
Progesterone<br>
     <dd>Day of LH Surge:  <1.5 ng/ml
     <dd>Mid Luteal Phase  >15 ng/ml<br>
Prolactin: <25 ng/ml<br>
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH): 0.4 to 3.8 uIU/ml<br>
Free T3: 1.4 to 4.4 pg/ml<br>
Free Thyroxine (T4):  0.8 to 2.0 ng/dl<br>
Total Testosterone:  6.0 to 89 ng/dl<br>
Free Testosterone:  0.7 to 3.6 pg/ml<br>
DHEAS:  35 TO 430 UG/DL<br>
Androstenedione:  0.7 to 3.1 ng/ml <p>
   <= less than; >= greater than; mIU=milli International Units;
ml=milliliter; pg=picograms; ng=nanograms; uIU=micro
International Units; dl=deciliter; ug=micrograms<p> 

<b>NOTE: </b> These levels are 
those used at the Chapel Hill Fertility Center laboratory, and have been 
excerpted from "The Couple's Guide to Fertility" by Berger, Goldstein and 
Fuerst, published by Doubleday.<p>

<b>ADDITIONAL TESTING:</b> After the initial workup, many doctors continue with 
some of the following tests.<p>
<b><a name="hsg">HYSTEROSALPINOGRAM (HSG):</a></b>  This test is used to examine a woman's 
uterus and fallopian tubes.  It is essentially an x-ray procedure in 
which a radio-opaque dye is injected through the cervix into the uterus 
and fallopian tubes.  This "dye" appears white on the x-ray, and allows 
the radiologist and your doctor to see if there are any abnormalities, 
such as an unusually shaped uterus, tumors, scar tissue or blockages in 
the fallopian tubes.  If you are trying to get pregnant in the same cycle 
as an HSG, make sure to schedule the test PRIOR to ovulation so that 
there is no danger of "flushing out" a released egg or developing embryo.<p>

Although most women report only minor cramping and short-term discomfort 
during this procedure, some women, especially those who DO have blockages,
 report intense pain.  Speak to your doctor about taking a pain 
medication about 30 minutes prior to the actual procedure.<p>
<b>HYSTEROSCOPY:</b>  If a uterine abnormality is suspected after the HSG, 
your doctor may opt for this procedure, performed with a thin telescope 
mounted with a fiber optic light, called a hysteroscope.  The 
hysteroscope is inserted through the cervix into the uterus and enables 
the doctor to see any uterine abnormalities or growths.  "Photos" are taken for future reference.  This 
procedure is usually performed in the early half of a woman's cycle so 
that the build-up of the endometrium does not obscure the doctor's view.  
However, if the doctor is planning to do an endometrial biopsy at the 
same time, it is done near the end of the cycle.  <p>
<b>LAPAROSCOPY</b>: A narrow fiber optic telescope is inserted through a 
woman's abdomen to look at the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries and 
to discern endometriosis or pelvic adhesions, and is the best diagnostic 
tool for evaluating the ovaries.  This test us usually done two or three 
days before menstruation is expected, and only after an HCG beta blood 
test ensures the woman is not pregnant. <p>
<b>ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY:</b>This procedure involves a scraping a small amount 
of tissue from the endometrium shortly before menstruation is due---
between 11 and 13 days from LH surge.  It should ONLY be performed after 
an HCG blood test shows the woman is not pregnant.  This test is used to 
determine if a woman has a luteal phase defect, a hormonal imbalance 
which prevents a woman from sustaining a pregnancy because not enough 
progesterone is produced.  <p>
