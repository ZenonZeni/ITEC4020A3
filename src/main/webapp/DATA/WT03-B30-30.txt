US FY96 DEFENSE BUDGET
FEATURES, CONTROVERSIES, AND A VETO THAT STANDS

     Some aspects of the new $275 billion FY96 defense
budget include:
  *  $159 million for six F-16C/Ds and $311 million for six
F-15Es (planes President Clinton did not want) to keep the
assembly lines open and provide spare aircraft to replace
those expected to be lost in accidents through 2005.
  *  New supercomputers, engines for new LPD-17 amphibious
ships, and auxiliary power units for New Attack Submarines
can only be purchased from US manufacturers.
  *  60 more UH60 Blackhawk helicopters (the Army needs 700)
over 5 years and the upgrade of AH64 helicopters and M1A2
tanks.
  *  $100 million to modify 20 Navy EA-6B jammer aircraft to
support Air Force operations.
  *  $827 million to start building a third Seawolf, half of
what President Clinton asked for. However, it provided $1.3
billion for an LHD-7 and $974 million for an LPD-17,
amphibious ships Clinton did not want.
  *  Development of a missile defense system by 2003.
President Clinton is concerned that the Russian parliament
might consider the mere plan an "anticipatory breech" of the
ABM treaty.
     The House approved the bill 267-149 on 15 Dec. The
Senate approved it 51-43 on 19 Dec and sent it to the White
House. President Clinton vetoed the bill on 28 Dec, citing
the missile defense provisions and a new rule that would
have required Congressional approval to keep troops deployed
for 45 days. President Clinton did not mention the B-2
bomber funding in his veto message, but did note that the
bill would force the discharge of HIV-positive soldiers and
block access to abortions overseas. The House tried (and
failed) to override the veto on 3 Jan.

FIFTH FRENCH NUCLEAR TEST SPARKS OUTRAGE
COURT REFUSES TO RETURN CONFISCATED GREENPEACE SHIPS

     France set off its fifth nuclear test on Mururoa Atoll
at 0930 local time on 28 Dec. The blast was equal to 30KT.
This touched off another round of world-wide condemnation,
which France dismissed.
     A French court on Tahiti ruled on 5 Dec that the
confiscated ships Rainbow Warrior II and Greenpeace (along
with a helicopter and several small boats) had been seized
legally and would not be returned to their owner
(Greenpeace). Greenpeace said it would appeal. France
announced on 6 Dec that it would cut the series short at six
tests to be completed by February. Greenpeace, Australia,
and New Zealand demanded that the halt be imposed effective
immediately. The UN voted 85-18 on 12 Dec to condemn the
French and Chinese nuclear tests and demand the immediate
end to all testing. Another 43 nations abstained and 31 did
not vote.
     Panama demanded an explanation of two French military
airlift flights which landed in Panama to refuel on 19 July
and 2 Aug en route to Mururoa. As this was just before the
tests began, Panama is concerned that the planes might have
carried nuclear weapons in violation of the 1977 accords
with the US.

RIFLES OVER BENGAL:
A MYSTERIOUS ARMS SHIPMENT FALLS INTO THE INDIAN NIGHT

     A mysterious aircraft dropped at least three packages
of weapons over the Purulia district of West Bengal (in
eastern India) on 17 Dec. Troops fanned out to search local
villages and recovered 231 Russian AK-47 assault rifles (and
Chinese AK-56 copies), 17,000 rounds of ammunition, ten
rocket launchers, 80 anti-tank rockets, eight 9mm pistols
with holsters, manuals, and hundreds of rifle cleaning kits.
There are radical guerrilla groups in several surrounding
areas, but none are known to operate in Purulia. (One
radical group, the Ananda Margis or Pleasure Seekers, have
an estate nearby, but their last armed resistance was 30
years ago. Police arrested 11 members of that group.) The
crates were addressed to the commander of a Bangladeshi
military base across the border, but this was thought to be
a deception effort. Curiously, India's air defense radar
system was not operating on the night of the air drop, and
the Indian government ordered a review of air security.
     Indian fighters forced an An-26 air transport
registered in Hong Kong with a crew of five Latvians and one
Briton to land in Bombay on 23 Dec (after Indian
intelligence identified it). Police said the crew had
confessed to deliberately dropping the weapons. A New
Zealander originally part of the crew, Kim Davy, was being
sought after he eluded Indian police. Two New Delhi
businessmen were arrested in the case.
     Another air transport was forced to land in New Delhi
on 24 Dec, and its crew of nine was arrested as India
increased its monitoring of civilian air traffic. India said
that Pakistan had been involved in the episode, but the
Pakistanis said this charge was a smokescreen.

AND NOW, THE MiG-1.42 MULTI-FUNCTION INTERCEPTOR

     The first flight of the new MiG-1.42 MFI
(multi-function interceptor) is to take place early this
year at Ramenskoye. The twin-engine aircraft is thought to
be unusually maneuverable as it has fly-by-wire and 16
control surfaces (including canards and a twin tail). It is
designed to compete (both in combat and the export market)
with the F-22, Eurofighter-2000, and Dassault Rafale (three
fighters that are not in the same class by any means). The
MiG-1.42 has supersonic cruise capability and is partly
stealthy. Even if flight tests are successful, it will not
enter service until sometime after 2000.

1995: A BETTER YEAR FOR JOURNALISTS

     A total of 50 reporters, editors, and journalists were
killed in the line of duty during 1995, less than half of
the total of 103 who died on duty in 1994 and the lowest
since 1988. Of the 50, 22 were killed in Algeria (almost all
by the radical Islamic fundamentalists), five in Russia
(including Chechnya), four in Brazil, three in ethnic strife
in Burundi, and three in Sri Lanka (in combat or terrorist
assassinations). Two were killed in Tadjikhistan and two in
Colombia. One reporter was killed in each of the following:
Angola, Somalia, Tunisia, Croatia, Azerbaijan, Britain,
Mexico, Canada, and India.

THE ITALIAN ARMORED CORPS IS REORGANIZED FOR NEW VEHICLES

     Italy plans to reorganize its Army. The new structure
will include two tank and three mechanized brigades as the
only "all tracked vehicles" brigades. These units will share
120 refitted Leopard-1A5 and 200 new Ariete tanks. (The
first Ariete was delivered on 1 Dec.) About 500 new Dardo
VCC-80 infantry fighting vehicles armed with a 25mm cannon
and two TOW missiles each are to be purchased to outfit
these units. (The first 150 of these were ordered this
year.)
     The Ariete Tank Brigade will be assigned to the British
3rd Division, while the new Italian 3rd Division will
include the Legnano and Friuli mechanized brigades and a
Portuguese parachute brigade. The Garibaldi mechanized
brigade will be formed as an all-volunteer unit for "out of
area" missions. The Italians have also ordered 250 Puma 4x4
armored cars for use by the Folgore parachute brigade and
some cavalry regiments; the other cavalry units will make do
with the Veltro armored truck.

FOUR STEPS TO EFFECTIVE LEADERSHIP

     Four steps to becoming an effective leader:
  *  Exemplify professionalism and ethics, including
integrity, devotion to duty, and selfless service. Undertake
every mission with enthusiasm.
  *  Communicate with soldiers. This includes developing the
skills to tell soldiers what is expected of them and
learning to listen to what soldiers are telling you. Reading
body language to determine if the soldier actually
understands and will perform the task he says he understands
and will perform is a key tool.
  *  Build cohesive teams. It is easier to control a group
of teams trained to work together than to control a horde of
individuals. Teams must be built horizontally so that team
members can take care of each other and solve many small
problems without bothering their commanders. But teams must
also be built vertically so that they trust their commanders
and believe they will take care of and support them.
  *  Provide purpose and direction by first creating a
vision of what the unit is to be, then by establishing goals
that will bring about that vision. A series of objectives
must be established leading the unit to each goal.

O'GRADY RESCUE WAS ONE MISSILE AWAY FROM DISASTER
IF "JOINTNESS" IS GOING TO WORK,
IT NEEDS TRAINING NOT LIP SERVICE

     According to an analysis in Armed Forces Journal
International, the Marine effort to rescue downed pilot
Scott O'Grady was not performed with the best equipment for
the mission and the personnel did not have the best training
available. Some key points:
  *  The CH-53E helicopters used for over-water rescue were
inadequate to the mission over Bosnia because their flare
systems could only distract the oldest versions of the SA-7.
(Fortunately, the two missiles fired at the rescue aircraft
were of this ancient type.) The Air Force MH-60K Pave Hawk
rescue helicopters have more extensive jamming and decoy
systems and could have evaded shots by SA-16s or Stingers.
If there had been one modern shoulder-fired missile along
the flight path, the US would have been dealing with the
death or capture of 30 Marines. The MH-60K is fitted with
jungle-penetrating rescue gear that the CH-53E (expected to
operate over the ocean) does not have.
  *  The rescue force could have been fitted with Ranger
Body Armor able to stop 7.62mm AK47 rounds. Instead, they
wore flak jackets able to stop only grenade fragments. One
concealed Serbian rifleman willing to take his chances with
the Cobras could have caused many casualties with one burst.
  *  The Marines had night vision devices in case the rescue
lasted into the hours of darkness, but did not have night
weapons sights. This equipment is in the US inventory but is
not issued to rescue teams.
  *  The Marines on the rescue team could have been issued
Tactical Load-Bearing Vests which double as a rescue
harness, allowing a few soldiers left behind to be quickly
rescued by dropping them a rope. Instead, they relied on
being dropped rescue harnesses they would have had to take
time to put on before they could be lifted out.
  *  The Army insists on training at least one man in ten
(and strives to do better than that) in emergency medical
procedures that could save the life of a gravely-wounded
man. The Marines do not have a parallel training program and
rely on the one medic in every 40-man platoon, although all
Marines (indeed all US service personnel) get at least
rudimentary first aid training.
  *  The Marine rescue team relied on stretchers to carry
wounded men (these were not actually needed) instead of more
efficient collapsible litters used by the Army Special
Forces.
  *  Few if any Marines (other than pilots) take the
Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape class taught at
Fort Bragg, NC. Army and Air Force rescue teams are given
this training. (The Marines assume that their Force Recon
training adequately covers this specialized subject, and
could be partly right.)
     [The O'Grady rescue might be regarded as the final
endorsement -- or condemnation -- of the concept of
"jointness". The Marine unit was given pilot rescue as an
additional duty because there were not enough specialized
Air Force rescue units in the theater, clearly what
"jointness" is all about. The Marines had never been
provided the specialized equipment, aircraft, and training
for the rescue mission, and the fact that it worked was due
as much to their attempts to make up this training on their
own as it was to their good fortune in the actual event.
Jointness is going to require dollars for tools and
training, not just lip service, if it is going to work.]

MILITARY SPACE: TITAN-4, ISRAELI ASTRONAUTS, SKIPPER

     A TITAN-4 booster carried a spy satellite from
Vandenburg into a polar orbit on 5 Dec. It was the fourth
Titan-4 launch of 1995 and the first from Vandenburg in two
years.
     ISRAEL: The US agreed to train Israeli astronauts for a
future space shuttle mission.
     SKIPPER is a 550-pound US satellite launched by a
Russian SL-6 booster on 28 Dec, which also carried the
Indian IRS-C spy satellite. Skipper is to be used by the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization to test aerobraking
and the performance of reentry vehicles.

ADVANCED AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS: SUPER STEALTH, PREDATOR DRONES
DELAYED IN RETURN TO BOSNIAN SKIES, TUAV, MIG-AT TRAINER

     SUPER STEALTH: The Air Force plans to ask for a series
of improvements to its F-117 stealth strike fighters to
improve their jamming and communications gear and allow them
to carry more types of weapons (small bombs, stand-off
weapons, adverse-weather-guided weapons, JDAM, JSOW). The
final design was tested (in computer simulations) against a
2010 Syria air defense network including SA-10s,
Mirage-2000s, MiG-29s, and Su-27s.
     PREDATOR drones will begin operating from a base in
Hungary to fly over Bosnia in mid-March. (The Army wanted
them in operation on 1 Jan.) The drones will be operated by
the Air Force.
     TUAV: The Pentagon has accelerated plans to field a
smaller "Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle" with a range of
120 miles and an endurance of 3-4 hours, operating from land
bases or ships. The Pentagon wants 32 drones (to start with)
at a third of a million dollars each.
     MiG-AT: The new Advanced Trainer by MiG is to start
flight tests on 20 Jan at Ramenskoye. Russia plans to buy
250-300 trainers (either ATs or the competing Yak design) to
replace its L-29 and L-39 fleets; India and Uzbekhistan have
already signed options on the plane. MiG thinks the global
market is about 1,200 aircraft. The plane will use Larzac
engines developed in cooperation with the Western engine
companies Snecma and Turbomeca.

THEATER HIGH ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE MISSILE

     A test of the Theater High Altitude Area Defense
missile on 13 Dec failed to strike the Storm target missile.
The THAAD weapon was off course when it came into engagement
range. While it maneuvered toward the target, it ran out of
fuel before reaching an intercept course.
     The Army expects to form two THAAD battalions, starting
in 2002 with both operational by 2005. Each will have four
batteries, and each battery will have nine launchers and a
total of 136 troops. One battery (B-1/6) and a battalion
headquarters was activated last June for the test program.

ARMORED VEHICLE UPDATE: LONG RANGE GUNNERY CANNOT BE TRAINED
WITH THE CURRENT AMMUNITION, IRAN REFITS T-55s, LAV-105 GONE

     LONG RANGE GUNNERY is a key skill that the US Army tank
corps needs, but the existing M865PIP training ammunition
was designed to lose velocity quickly for use on restricted
training ranges and, hence, is too inaccurate at long range
to be used in training to engage targets beyond 2,500m. The
Army needs to train for gunnery to 3,000m and to train one
or two "sniper tanks" per company to shoot accurately to
4,000m.
     IRAN has refitted some Iraqi T-55s captured during the
1980-88 war as Safir-74 (Messenger of God 74) tanks with
"major improvements in engine power, transmission system,
firepower, and an internal fire extinguisher".
     LAV-105: The US Marines have finally given up trying to
buy 150 LAV-105 tank destroyer/assault guns, but did
complete the development objectives of the program. The
three prototypes logged 24,000 miles and fired 2,400 main
gun rounds.

ESPIONAGE: POLLARD, BRITAIN, UKRAINE, FRANCE

     POLLARD: Israel announced on 21 Nov that it would give
Israeli citizenship to convicted spy Jonathan Pollard.
Pollard, who gave US intelligence (including that received
from friendly Arab nations) to Israel, has completed 10
years of his sentence and is now eligible for parole.
     BRITAIN announced that Stephen Lander would succeed
Stella Rimington as head of the MI5 counter-intelligence
agency.
     UKRAINE expelled two Polish priests for espionage and
other activities in the ethnic-Polish regions of western
Ukraine. In order to avoid an incident, the two were simply
sent home instead of arrested and placed on trial.
     FRANCE jailed Algerian Joseph Karon for passing
military electronics secrets to Moscow for money between
1989 and 1992.

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER; ILLEGAL ARMS SALES
SHIPMENTS TO LIBYA; NEW TECHNOLOGY CONTROL DEAL

     ITALY: Customs police seized ten tons of spare parts
for combat aircraft (mostly for MiGs) hours before they were
to be sent to Libya (by a ship with documents claiming it
was going elsewhere).
     WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT: Officials from 28 countries (the
16 NATO countries, Russia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, the
Czech Republic, Austria, Australia, Japan, Finland, Ireland,
New Zealand, Sweden, and Switzerland) signed an agreement on
a new international technology export control system on 19
Dec. The Wassenaar Arrangement took two years to negotiate
and replaces the defunct Cold War control group known as
COCOM.
     LIBYA: Scottish businessman David McKeeve was charged
in Boston (US) on 19 Dec with trying to export $250,000
worth of computers to Libya.

RUSSIA AND THE FORMER USSR: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: While the final results of the elections (158
seats for the communists, 91 for Zhirinovski's nationalists,
55 for Chernomyrdin's Our Home party, and 44 for the
reformist Yabloko group) would not be known for another
week, the result was clear enough. The government said that
the stronger communist delegation would not cause changes in
policy. (No major parties would ally with the communists.)
Thirty-nine parties (which won a total of 50.3% of the vote)
had failed to meet the threshold of 5% to win seats on the
"party list" half of parliament, but many of them won a few
seats in local constituencies. [The parliamentary elections
were, in the final analysis, of little real importance.
Everyone was maneuvering for the decisive presidential
elections in June.] NATO said the Russian elections would
not affect its expansion plans.
     Chechnya: Russian heavy artillery and Grad missile
launchers pounded Gudermes, the second-largest city in
Chechnya, which had been seized by rebels a week earlier.
[Russian troops had repeatedly announced that the city had
been cleared, but apparently managed to discover more rebels
each time.]
  *  20 Dec: Rutskoi and Lebed charged that the election
commission had conspired to keep their parties from scoring
5% of the vote.
     Chechnya: Refugees from Gudermes said the town had been
subjected to the worst shelling in a year of war. There was
hand-to-hand fighting in the streets. Rebel commander Akhmed
Zakayev told Russian television that the Russian guns and
rockets had destroyed half of the town but he planned to
hold the city.
     Ukraine and the G7 nations signed a $2.3 billion deal
to close the Chernobyl reactor by the year 2000.
     Belarussian President Lukashenko named Valentin Agolets
to head the Interior (police) Ministry and Vladimir
Matskevich to head the National Security Service
(intelligence).
  *  21 Dec: Shipyard workers in Polyarny would not allow a
nuclear submarine they had just repaired leave because the
government had not paid them since August.
     Aslan Maskhadov, overall military commander of the
Chechen rebel forces, ordered his troops out of Gudermes to
spare further civilian casualties and damage to the
buildings. About 150 soldiers had been killed and 150 more
wounded in a week of fighting. Other rebels captured
Achkhoi-Martin.
  *  22 Dec: Chechen rebels still held key buildings in
Gudermes. Russian troops moved in to besiege the town,
holding off on a full-scale assault to avoid causing massive
civilian casualties.
  *  23 Dec: Chechnya: Russian troops recaptured the
Gudermes train station, where 70 Russian security troops had
been under siege.
  *  24 Dec:  Russian troops secured Gudermes.
     Moldova: The rebellious ethnic-Russian Dnestr region
held its own parliamentary elections in defiance of the
Moldovan government. In a referendum, 82% voted to declare
the Dnestr Republic a sovereign and independent state and
apply for CIS membership separately from Moldova.
     Tadjikhistan: Russian border guards killed 65 Tajik
rebels trying to infiltrate the border from Afghanistan.
     Kirghizstan held the first multi-party presidential
elections in its history. President Akayev won easily (71%)
over two rival candidates. International observers said the
vote had been fair but questioned the exclusion of three
stronger opposition candidates on technicalities.
  *  25 Dec: Civilians began moving back into Gudermes.
  *  26 Dec: Yeltsin left the sanatorium for his country
home. His first act was to create a new Council on Foreign
Policy which will report directly and only to him and not to
parliament.
     Doku Zavgayev, the puppet Russian governor of Chechnya,
said the election had given him a mandate to make peace.
Russia denied that General Shkirko had said that 267
civilians had been killed in Gudermes.
  *  27 Dec: Border guards commander Andrei Nikolayev said
he needed more money to seal the borders against drug
smugglers, arms merchants, and trespassers. He received less
than half of the $2.6 million he asked for.
  *  28 Dec: There was furious maneuvering by presidential
candidates. None of the top candidates can hope for 50% of
the first ballot, forcing a run-off. [The problem is that
three factions -- communist, nationalist, and
reformist -- will be fighting for the two places on the
run-off ballot.]
     Chechnya: Rebel and Russian troops clashed at
Achkhoi-Martin.
  *  29 Dec: Zhirinovsky demanded three cabinet posts and
the speakership of the Duma as his price to support the
Yeltsin government.
     A terrorist bomb in Grozny killed one and injured 14.

YUGOSLAVIA: CIVIL WAR: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: A US Air Force C-17 delivered the first M109
self-propelled howitzer into Tuzla. Due to a new radar
system, the airport was fully operational despite snow and
fog. Troops of the 3/325 Parachute Battalion were deployed
around the airfield. [The 1st US Brigade is to be deployed
in Posavina-Brcko-Gradacac. The 2nd US Brigade will deploy
in Zvornik-Olovo-Tuzla. The Russians will cover east of
Brcko and Zvornik. Most troops will arrive by Route Arizona,
Orasje-Loncari-Cerik-Tuzla. US supplies will come in by
Route Michigan from Samac and Gradacac to Tuzla.] The US
Army pontoon bridge over the Sava was still not complete,
and seven trainloads of US Army equipment were clustered at
the crossing area. British LtGen Sir Michael Walker arrived
in Sarajevo to command the NATO Rapid Reaction Corps, the
ground component of IFOR. British LtGen Rupert Smith,
commander of the UN forces, left Sarajevo the next day. The
US sharply rebuked Belgrade for suggesting that the Moslems
slaughtered at Srebrenica had been murdered by other Moslem
factions and said it would block Belgrade's attempts to
rejoin the UN until it cooperated with the investigation.
Belgrade authorized NATO to cross its territory to support
the peacekeeping operation. A spokesman for UNSG Ghali said
that the UN troops in Bosnia were not sent there to stop a
war but were now being blamed for a lack of peace. The OSCE
selected US diplomat Robert Frowick to head the civilian
aspects of the Dayton Accords. [This appointment was forced
through by the US over the opposition of France, which
demanded that the job go to a European.] US envoy Holbooke
acknowledged that US troops might have to disarm Bosnian
Serb units by force.
     Montenegro said it would not recognize Croatia until it
gave up the Prevlaka Peninsula. [Montenegro expects to
eventually absorb the southeastern Bosnian Serbs, and wants
Prevlaka.]
  *  20 Dec: NATO took control of the Bosnian peacekeeping
mission from the UN. Many troops that had been on duty with
the UN transferred to NATO command, repainting their
vehicles and exchanging white or blue UN headgear for green
caps and helmets. To enforce its status, NATO began
dismantling roadblocks and moving troops into areas the
warring factions had prohibited the UN from entering. US
Major General Nash (commander, 1st Armored Division) drove
to meet Brigadier General O'Neal (head of his supply lines)
on a road that the Serbs had blocked for years. (Nash was
escorted by a Danish tank platoon.) Nash met with Bosnian
Serb General Simic and Bosnian (Moslem) 2nd Corps Commander
Brigadier General Sead Delic at different times. An armored
British patrol (30 vehicles of the Light Dragoons) bulldozed
aside a Serbian roadblock near Krupa and headed for Banja
Luka. US helicopter pilots were warned the Islamic and other
spies in Hungary would be watching their operations. Serbs
in Sarajevo declared the NATO troops to be an army of
occupation.
     The UN Security Council told UNSG Ghali to assemble a
peacekeeping force "able to defense itself" for Eastern
Slavonia and named US diplomat Jacques Klein (a Major
General in the Air Force Reserve) to head it.
  *  21 Dec: The UN Security Council demanded that the Serbs
allow international investigators access to all grave sites
and prisoners in their territory. The Security Council also
approved a 1,700-man international police force for Bosnia
which will be used to recruit and train a new local police
force. The US held talks with Turkey on setting up a
training program for the Bosnian (Moslem) Army. A Brigade of
the Russian 98th Parachute Division under General Alexander
Bespalov was in final training at Kostroma. The
international donors conference came up with $500 million to
start the rebuilding process in Bosnia. IFOR leased a hotel
in Ilidza from the Serbs to use as the ground force
headquarters. The Moslem government complained that IFOR
should have leased the building from it rather than the
Serbs, but IFOR said that as the Serbs presently controlled
Ilidza there was no real option but to lease it from them.
NATO shut down Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia. The OSCE
named Swiss diplomat Gret Haller as human rights envoy.
Russian General Staskov met with Bosnian Serb General Mladic
in Pale. [This was disturbing. Staskov is technically part
of IFOR, which is technically not supposed to meet with
indicted war criminals.]
  *  22 Dec: The Moslem government formally ended the state
of war. The Moslem government issued a statement promising
safety for the Sarajevan Serbs, but they remained skeptical
of coming under Moslem control. Many continued digging up
graveyards to move the remains to Serbian-held areas to the
east. Sarajevan Serb leaders were actually blocking roads
and stalling permits to keep people from leaving the city.
President Clinton and Senator Dole maneuvered over who would
visit the troops in Bosnia and when. (Both wanted to go as
soon as possible, but the Army wants to delay this for
weeks.) US troops went on alert when no one told them it was
the day for the Danish tank unit's target practice. Unknown
gunmen fired at two NATO aircraft involved in aid
operations.
     UNSG Ghali criticized Croatia for doing too little to
stop the killing of Krajina Serb civilians and the arson of
their homes after the Croats overran the area last fall.
Ghali particularly noted that Croat troops did not bury
Serbian dead reported by UN inspection teams and had not
turned over registrations for 750 new graves. The Security
Council demanded that Croatia drop its 27 Dec deadline for
Krajina Serbs to return to the area to reclaim their
property.
  *  23 Dec: British Light Dragoons were manning an outpost
near Banja Luka and said they had been welcomed by the
Serbs.
  *  24 Dec: Unable to get the pontoon bridge built across
the Sava (which was in full flood and wider than expected),
US Army engineers used some of the pontoons to set up a
ferry to move a few vehicles across the river each day. Two
British soldiers were slightly wounded by a land mine.
Moslem and Serb troops gave up their most exposed positions
in Sarajevo. Celebratory firing by Bosnians greeted peace
and the Christmas holidays. Serb and Moslem units exchanged
200 prisoners. The first US combat helicopters (three
Apaches and five Blackhawks) flew from Hungary into Tuzla.
  *  25 Dec: Sarajevo held the first peaceful Christmas
since 1992 as the Serbs and Moslems continued moving out of
frontline positions. US Navy SEAL frogmen checked the
bridging site on the Sava River for obstacles. A British
soldier committed suicide in Sarajevo. Bosnian Croat gunners
fired on a British helicopter near Jajce; it was not hit.
This was the fifth such incident, and NATO said that such
fire was "undisciplined and unacceptable". A US helicopter
made an emergency landing in Serb territory due to
transmission problems; it was recovered without incident.
  *  26 Dec: NATO reported no armed resistance to its
mission or its "go anywhere" mandate. The ferry carried six
Bradley scout vehicles of the 1/1 Cavalry into Bosnia, the
first armor to cross the Sava. Admiral Smith met Bosnian
Serb parliamentary president Momcilo Krajisnik in Pale. The
Serbs said they wanted to delay the handover of Sarajevo
suburbs to the Moslems; Admiral Smith (allowed by the
accords to grant such a delay) said a polite "no" but
indicated he might review the situation later if there was
good reason to. (The Moslems quickly expressed "deep
disappointment" with this answer.) US helicopters noted that
they were being "painted" by Hungarian air defense (not fire
control) radars when flying over Hungary and Croatia; this
was not regarded as a problem.
  *  27 Dec: The Serbs and Moslems had pulled back from
their front line position in Sarajevo. A platoon of Bradley
fighting vehicles was manning "Checkpoint Assassin" five
miles south of the Sava. General Nash held a meeting with
local Serb, Croat, and Moslem commanders at Porebrice to
establish rules and convince them to start removing mines.
The US agreed to send two artillery-locating radar sets into
Sarajevo to replace five Dutch and British radars being
moved west. In a month, French radars will replace the
Americans (two French radars are there now). Helicopters had
to rescue French troops at Mostar after a dam collapsed and
flooded their camp. Spanish troops completed a patrol
through Croat, Serb, and Moslem territory around Mostar,
entering areas previously banned to UN forces.
  *  28 Dec: The rising Sava River flooded out the US Army
camp north of the bridging site. The Army took over the
local ferry, shutting down civilian traffic across the
river. A detachment of US troops landed in Belgrade and
drove (in trucks and humvees) to Tuzla across the Drina
River bridge without incident. [These were the first NATO
troops to ever enter Serbia.] The Serbs complained that
most of the reconstruction aid was going into Moslem and
Croat areas. Bad weather stopped Italian troops from
deploying to Bosnia. The US suspended its sanctions on
Serbia and Montenegro.
  *  29 Dec: The Army sent heavy Chinook helicopters to
carry pontoons into the middle of the Sava River, speeding
up the bridge-building process. President Clinton arranged
to visit Bosnia in early January. A French plane landed in
Mostar, the first plane to land there since 1992.
     Despite UN warnings, NATO commander Joulwan ruled out
sending US troops into Eastern Slavonia, saying his forces
were totally committed with the Bosnia mission and he had
none to spare for Croatia.
  *  30 Dec: US Army Specialist Martin John Begosh became
the first US casualty when his humvee drove over a mine; he
survived with minor injuries. [The patrol thought it was
moving up a main road, but quickly found the road overgrown
with brush, indicating no one had used it in years. The men
on the patrol admitted that this should have been enough to
warn them to turn back.] Ukraine made a last-minute decision
to keep its 550 troops in Bosnia at its own expense in order
to enhance its international prestige. Several of Karadzic's
close political allies resigned from the Bosnian Serb
parliament as he steadily lost his grip on power. US Navy
technicians began operating an entertainment radio station
in Tuzla.
  *  31 Dec: US engineers finally completed the floating
ribbon bridge over the Sava River, and a column of US tanks
and armored vehicles from the 1/1 Cavalry began pouring
south. (The center section of the bridge is removed each day
to allow barges to move along the river. The bridge includes
85 floating segments, each 22 feet or 7m long. The total
span of 600m is longer than the 400m pontoon bridge at
Remagen in 1945. It actually includes a 373m span over the
river and a 225m span over a lagoon on the north bank.)
Bosnian Serbs in Banja Luka were increasingly unhappy with
their government  in Pale, which appeared to have no time
for anyone but the Serbs in the Sarajevo suburbs. The first
German military cargo ship arrived in Sibenik. Nervous NATO
troops watched as Bosnians of all factions celebrated the
new year with a fusillade of gunfire.

NORTHERN IRELAND: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Sinn Fein chairman McLaughlin said that peace was
slipping from the grasp of leaders in Northern Ireland
because of British intransigence.
     Five former IRA members, all linked in some way to the
drug trade, were murdered in Ulster during December. The
previously unknown group Direct Action Against Drugs claimed
credit, but the British insisted it was the IRA. [The
British also did not regard these killings, as a violation
of the ceasefire.] The murders cast a shadow over the peace
process, and the British cancelled plans to give 10 IRA
prisoners early release. PM Majors said it was laughable for
Sinn Fein to continue claiming that it and the IRA were
totally separate organizations.
     On 20 Dec, senior British and Irish officials met for
the first time with a leader of an Ulster political party
(the moderate Alliance Party).

PERSIAN GULF: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  18 Dec: Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmad
al-Sabah (who had held the post for 30 years) offered to
resign after foreign policy differences with Emir Jaber
al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who then convinced him to stay on the
job. (The Foreign Minister wants to restore relations with
countries that supported Iraq during the Gulf War; the Emir
does not.)
  *  20 Dec: The IAEA said that documents turned over
recently by Iraq listed equipment used in pre-war nuclear
weapons programs that had been hidden or taken to other
locations. The IAEA said that these items might have to be
found and destroyed to meet the requirements of the UN
sanctions. Iraq pledged to cooperate and said it was still
considering a UN resolution allowing limited oil sales to
fund relief programs. President Clinton said he was ready to
talk to Iran but that relations could not be normalized
until Iran stops supporting terrorist and subversive groups.
  *  21 Dec: UN arms inspector Ekeus displayed a gyroscope
recovered from the Tigris River which showed Iraq was still
trying to secretly build large ballistic missiles. King
Hussein of Jordan warned that Iraq was close to the point of
collapse. Sheikh Khalifa Bin Hamad al-Thani, deposed as emir
of Qatar by his own son while on a trip to Europe, visited
the neighboring UAE in a move widely thought to start a
campaign to return to power.
  *  22 Dec: The Iranian opposition group Mujahideen Khalq
accused Iranians of attacking one of their bases near
Baghdad with an 81mm mortar. Iran dismissed new US
sanctions, saying the world would ignore them.
  *  23 Dec: Iran began a three-day naval exercise in the
Gulf.
  *  24 Dec: Iraqi Air Force Captain Asaad Rahdi Shadwan (a
recent defector) told Kuwaiti authorities that Iraq had
moved "eight batteries of Scud missiles" to a secret
underground storage facility 23km north of Basra last May.
(Under the UN resolutions, Iraq is prohibited from owning
Scuds or deploying any missiles south of the 32nd parallel.)
An Iraqi Air Force Major flew an Allouette helicopter (tail
number 1037) to Arbil and defected. Iran said the allocation
by the US Congress of funds for covert operations was
"outright terrorism". The Iranians complained about this for
a week, protesting in the UN and threatening to match the
funds with their own campaign against the US.
  *  26 Dec: Jordan seized a shipment of "highly dangerous
acids and chemicals" which had been hidden inside a shipment
of medicine being sent into Iraq. The Kuwaiti parliament
ratified the UN Convention Against Torture. France pledged
to send 70,000 troops and 320 combat aircraft to the UAE if
it was threatened. [A similar deal with the British is
stalled because the British refuse to put their troops under
UAE law when deployed in that country as the French did. The
defense pacts are intended to promote chances of arms sales
to the UAE and other Gulf states.]
  *  28 Dec: Iraq tightened its border with Jordan after
moves by the Jordanian government against Saddam. Iran and
Russia signed a 10-year agreement to cooperate on military
and energy matters. The UN said it would reduce the
peacekeeping force in Kuwait because of a lack of funding.
  *  29 Dec: The six GCC states, plus Egypt and Syria,
issued a statement backing the UAE claim to Abu Musa and the
Tumb Islands; Iran called the statement "devisive".
  *  30 Dec: Iraq signed a deal to provide oil to Jordan.
Iraq doubled the cost of draft deferments to $800 (at the
black market rate).

TURKEY, THE KURDS, AND THE FLAME OF ISLAM
EVENTS 1-31 DEC 95

     PKK leader Ocalon announced a ceasefire inside Turkey
on 11 Dec through the new elections and called on the Turks
to observe it. Turkey said his offer could not be taken
seriously and continued its campaign of counter-insurgency
operations. The EU approved the long-delayed customs union
with Turkey on 13 Dec, but it did PM Ciller little good in
the elections.
     Turkey held its new elections on 24 Dec. The Islamist
Welfare Party won the most seats (21.13% and 159 seats) but
not enough to take power as no major parties would ally with
them. The opposition-conservative Motherland Party won
19.66% (134 seats) while Prime Minister Ciller's True Path
Party won 19.37% (133 seats). The conservatives ruled out
any alliance with the Welfare Party, but negotiations to
find a working coalition could take weeks. The Kurdish
People's Democracy Party won only 4.17% of the votes; having
failed to draw 5%, it was awarded no seats in parliament.

FIGHTING IN LEBANON: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     While the usual ambushes, shelling, roadside bombs, and
night raids continued in southern Lebanon, events of late
December were dominated by the Israeli-Syrian peace talks in
Maryland. Syrian President Assad said on 19 Dec that he
wanted the fighting to end, but only as part of an overall
settlement. Hezbollah fired a series of Katyusha rockets
into northern Israel on 29-30 Dec specifically to disrupt
the peace talks; one struck a house, but no one was injured.
Israel said it knew that not everything Hezbollah did was
with Syrian permission, but that it also knew the Syrians
could stop the Hezbollah attacks if it chose to do so.
     During a firefight on 29 Dec, Israeli tanks fired "bee
hive" flechette rounds (each loaded with thousands of steel
darts) into the village of Qabrikha, killing one man. The UN
says that such ammunition violates the 1949 Geneva
Convention on humane weapons, but the ammunition is in the
US inventory.

Moslem militants who turned themselves in, formally repented
for the insurgency, and signed a pledge of non-violence.
Security forces killed 28 rebels in six operations during
19-20 Dec (typical of the entire month); during the same
time a bomb in a cafe wounded 23 civilians. Militants
continued terrorist attacks, killing pesants, teachers,
policemen, and journalists. Zeroual named Ahmed Ouyahia as
the youngest prime minister in Algerian history on 31 Dec.

ISRAEL AND THE SEARCH FOR PEACE: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said
that Israeli settlers would have to leave the Golan to
achieve peace with Syria. Syria said it was premature to
hold a summit between President Assad and PM Peres.
  *  20 Dec: Arafat gave his personal support to the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks to be held in Washington on 27
Dec. Israel announced that in order to reduce tensions,
Israeli Jews would not be allowed into the
Palestinian-controlled town of Bethlehem starting the next
day. [This was intended to allow the locals, 40% of whom are
Palestinian Christians, to celebrate Christmas without
conflict.] The Palestinian police said the five Abu Nidal
commandoes captured while trying to assassinate Arafat had
been linked to Iran. [Iran denied any involvement.] Israeli
police said they had arrested 15 members of a Hamas cell in
Tulkarm that had planned a series of suicide bomb attacks on
Israelis. Israel banned seven US Jewish radicals from
entering the country or claiming citizenship.
  *  21 Dec: Israeli troops left Bethlehem. Four days of
PLO-Hamas talks in Cairo had deadlocked. Hamas said it would
not take part in the elections but would do nothing to stop
them. It refused, however, to abandon violent attacks on
Israelis. Ariel Sharon decided not to challenge Benjamin
Netanyahu for leadership of the Likud Party. The 13 banks in
the self-rule area were transferred to control of the
Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority (PISGA).
  *  22 Dec: Peres said Israel would "give up the atom"
[i.e., its nuclear weapons] once regional peace was
established. Jewish militant groups were reportedly hatching
new plots to kill Peres since the assassination of Rabin had
accelerated, rather than stopped, the peace process. [They
might have done "better" by killing Arafat or Hussein, as
that would have provoked war.]
  *  23 Dec: Syrian President Assad, visiting Egypt for
one-day talks, said he wanted to speed up the peace process.
Samiha Khalil, a 72-year-old Palestinian rights activist,
became the only opponent for Arafat in the presidential
race. Deodorus I, the Greek Orthodox patriarch of the Holy
Land, signed over custody of the Christian churches in
Bethlehem to Arafat. [Moslem Caliph Omar had signed those
same churches, or at least churches on the same sites, over
to Patriarch Sophronius in 638AD. The symbolic return of
control supposedly strengthens Arafat's position in
demanding control over East Jerusalem, as it shows he can be
trusted to protect the shrines of another faith.]
  *  24 Dec: The Israeli High Court of Justice banned the
Shin Bet security service from using physical force during
interrogations. Arafat condemned Hamas for boycotting the
elections. Israeli officials were surprised at the optimism
shown by Assad but said the extent of its withdrawal from
Golan and remaining security provisions was dependent on the
extent of the peace Syria offered. Israeli Foreign Minister
Barak said it was time for Gulf and Maghreb Arab states to
make peace with Israel. [Those states have always insisted
that Israel must make peace with all of its neighbors first.
Barak was hoping for more pressure on Syria.] Palestinian
gunmen wounded an Israeli soldier on the Gaza border. A
group of radical Israeli settlers "just happened" to decide
to visit the tomb of Rachel in Bethlehem to pray, knowing
that the Israeli troops guarding the "border" of the
self-rule zone would not allow them into the city. They then
flooded the Internet with stories about how Israeli soldiers
had enforced anti-Jewish racism.
     An Israeli court-martial sentenced 31 paratroopers to
56 days in jail for abandoning their post on the northern
border for less than an hour on 21 Dec. The men felt that
their new commander was not competent and said he did not
take the advice they had offered. When the dispute reached
an impasse after four months of arguing, some members of the
company walked out of their post, then returned when they
had cooled down. They could have been sentenced to 15 years
in prison. It was the first mass desertion in the history of
the Israeli Army.
  *  25 Dec: Peres survived two no-confidence motions
against returning the Golan to Syria. Seven hundred
candidates had registered for the 83 seats on the
Palestinian council. Interior Security Minister Moshe Shahal
expressed concern that Russian organized crime groups had
moved into Israel and were trying to work their way inside
the political system.
  *  26 Dec: Syria announced a team of very low-level
diplomats for the Washington talks and said it would not
discuss terrorist attacks against Israeli troops in Lebanon.
Israel regarded both moves as disappointing. Palestinian
police began assembling in villages near Hebron. Samiha
Khalil pledged to annul the Oslo self-rule accords and seek
a better deal  if elected.
  *  27 Dec: New Israeli-Syrian talks opened at the scenic
Wye Plantation conference center on Maryland's Eastern
Shore. Israel said that the main issue was security; Syria
said its negotiators were told to be flexible. Israeli
troops turned Ramallah over to the PISGA. Arafat's Fatah
faction had posted 70 candidates for the elections, but
dozens of Fatah members who did not approve of the list
registered as independents. Fatah warned them to pull out of
the elections or face party discipline. Palestinian police
arrested an editor of the large al-Quds newspaper for
failing to print a favorable article about Arafat on the
front page. The editor said there were already four
favorable articles about Arafat on the front page; he was
released on the 31st. Israel said it would free 1,000
Palestinian prisoners in the next week. A US court ordered
Arafat to give a deposition in the Achille Lauro case or the
PLO would be held liable for the hijacking. Arafat refused
and said that a splinter faction had conducted the operation
without his knowledge or consent.
  *  28 Dec: Arafat increased the Palestinian Council to 87
seats (after getting Israeli approval for 89).
  *  30 Dec: Israel said the new talks with Syria were
positive; Syria said they were "still just exploratory".
Several Hamas members registered as independent candidates
for election.
  *  31 Dec: Israel admitted for the first time that its
Mossad agents had murdered a Moroccan man in Norway in 1973
after mistaking him for  a Palestinian terrorist they were
sent to kill.

SRI LANKA: THE WAR IN THE EAST: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: The government ordered an end to the ban on
local press reporting of military operations at midnight on
the 20th, and said that the ban had been necessary to stop a
disinformation campaign that would have disrupted the
successful assault on Jaffna. The Tamil Tiger (LTTE) rebels
said that the Army had blocked all traffic in and out of
Batticaloa, but the Army denied this. A new Army operation
was trying to cut another route into Jaffna through
rebel-held areas, including the villages of Tolapuram,
Moolai, Thunavy, Sandilipay, and Vadukkodai.
  *  20 Dec: Troops held Jaffna City but could barely move
because of the thousands of mines the LTTE rebels had left
there. Thousands of booby traps had been left behind in
books, toys, cooking implements, and other articles likely
to be picked up. Many of the mines are linked to large
charges in adjacent buildings. These conditions were making
it impossible for civilians to return to their homes. Army
troops destroyed two rebel boats trying to infiltrate the
Jaffna Peninsula.
     At least 500 well-trained LTTE rebels were confirmed to
be in two camps in the Vakarai and Verugal areas south of
Trincomalee. The Vakarai camp, headquarters of rebel general
Karikalan, had increased its operations, including a new
satellite dish and radio antenna array. The Sea Tigers had
shifted their equipment and operations to the Verugal base.
  *  21 Dec: The Army said that the refugees would return to
Jaffna by April. The rebels, under heavy pressure from the
refugees within their lines, were allowing people not of
military age to leave.
  *  23 Dec: LTTE rebels from the Vakari base attacked an
Army detachment 10km south of Valachchenai (in Batticaloa
district). The savage fighting left 33 soldiers and 60
rebels dead.
  *  27 Dec: Army troops killed 15 rebels that tried to raid
Putur (a town on the Jaffna Peninsula). Thailand said it had
found no evidence to support Sri Lankan charges that LTTE
rebels were operating from a remote island in the Andaman
chain.
  *  28 Dec: Sri Lankan police opened their first station in
Jaffna in 10 years. LTTE rebels had begun mailing letter
bombs to government and Army officials in Batticaloa.
  *  30 Dec: The LTTE said it was ready to resume peace
talks if the Army pulled out of Jaffna. The government
refused.
  *  31 Dec: LTTE leader Prabhakaran asked the leaders of
the Indian state of Tamil Nadu to support the rebel
struggle.

INDIA, PAKISTAN, KASHMIR, AND NUCLEAR THREATS
EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Pakistan said on 20 Dec that it would not allow India
to gain an edge if it provokes an arms race in ballistic
missiles. Pakistan said it had made "a breakthrough in
nuclear technology" but was opposed to nuclear weapons
tests. Pakistan said any attempt by India to develop nuclear
missiles would be met "with an equal response" and called on
major powers to stop any Indian nuclear test. [The point of
such a test would be to verify that a new weapons design,
perhaps one suited to a missile warhead, would actually
work. The only Indian nuclear weapons test, in 1974, was of
an aircraft bomb.]
     India finally admitted that a botched commando raid on
al-Faran on 6 Dec had failed to rescue the four Western
hostages. Al-Faran insisted that three of them had been
killed and the other had fled into the night, but India said
police informers had spotted the men alive on 23 Dec.

     The Moslem terrorist group Abu Sayyaf and the communist
Alex Boncayao Brigade death squad continued to threaten a
campaign of death in Manilla, dismissing the declaration by
President Ramos that tighter security would stop such
attacks. Police and soldiers in the south went on "double
red alert" against expected attacks by Abu Sayyaf. On 31
Dec, police arrested nine more foreign Moslem extremists who
had entered the country to mount terrorist attacks.

NORTH KOREA FACES FAMINE: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     The UN wailed daily that North Korea faced famine and
starvation due to the destruction of crops and damage to
fields by the floods of last summer. The world, however,
showed little interest in helping the reclusive communist
state, which had brought most of its problems on itself and
which could solve its own problems by simply demobilizing
half of its vast war machine. The World Food Program was
forced to shut down its office in Pyongyang because no one
would donate food or funding. Even the release of five South
Korean fishermen arrested last May brought no aid. South
Korea said it would consider sending rice only if it
controlled the distribution, as the last rice shipment went
to feed the North Korean Army that threatens South Korea.
     There were frequent reports of "unusual military
movements" by North Korean troops just above the DMZ.
     Former South Korean Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh
Tae-woo were indicted on 21 Dec for masterminding the 1979
coup.

AFGHANISTAN: AND THE ROCKETS' RED GLARE...
EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: Taleban fired 58 rockets into Kabul. Rabbani's
government complained that Islamic aid agencies were
ignoring the half-million starving people in Kabul. In an
attack at dusk, Taleban seized the Gardanak Hills near
Charasiyab.
  *  20 Dec: Rabbani's troops, supported by air strikes,
counter-attacked into the Gardanak Hills. Taleban fired
rockets into Kabul.
  *  21 Dec: Taleban fired 12 rockets into Kabul. Dostam
said he had rejected Iranian pressure to join the Rabbani
government alliance.
  *  22 Dec: Taleban fired 17 rockets into Kabul in two
volleys. The Afghan government denied any involvement in the
campaign of terrorist bombings in northern Pakistan.
  *  23 Dec: Taleban fired 9 rockets into Kabul, aiming for
the Presidential palace. Taleban opened a road for convoys
to reach the city, but fighting in the area forced the
trucks to turn back.
  *  24 Dec: Taleban fired 12 rockets into Kabul. Pakistan
accused the Afghan consul-general in Peshawar of spying and
ordered him out of the country in 48 hours.
  *  27 Dec: Taleban fired eight rockets into Kabul.
  *  28 Dec: Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev postponed a
trip to negotiate the release of seven Russian airmen
arrested by Taleban on 3 Aug when Taleban, which had

  *  30 Dec: Taleban fired 12 rockets into Kabul.

     The Haitian Election Commission certified on 23 Dec
that Rene Preval had won 89% of the vote, but opposition
candidates claimed that the lackluster turnout of 25% meant
that 80% of Haitians "had not voted for Preval" and
presumably did not want him as president. Two of Aristide's
bodyguards were murdered on 24 Dec by gunmen the police
linked to FRAPH militias. The US insisted that its troops
would leave as scheduled on 29 Feb.

COLOMBIA: DRUGS AND REBELS: EVENTS 1-31 DEC 95

  *  5 Dec: Colombia said it had forced down and destroyed
four suspected drug-running planes over the last six weeks.
The Supreme Court ruled that following military orders could
not be used as a defense for committing murder and torture.
  *  8 Dec: British Staff Sergeant Timothy Cowley, kidnapped
119 days earlier by FARC rebels, was freed by a police
commando raid. The government ordered the arrest of a former
colonel and two soldiers for a 1991 massacre of 17 peasants.
  *  13 Dec: The Colombian Senate approved a controversial
new law that would make it harder to convict drug barons of
"illegal enrichment". The US warned Colombia that next year
it would be much more difficult to receive certification of
anti-drug performance, without which aid would be cut off.
President Samper said he would not resume extradition of
criminals to other countries.
  *  14 Dec: The investigating committee refused to indict
President Samper of knowingly accepting drug money in his
campaign due to lack of evidence. The US State Department
criticized the decision, resulting in a sharp protest from
Colombia. Samper said that the US should give him a vote of
confidence, not criticize him for being innocent.
  *  18 Dec: Anti-drug Czar Gabriel de Vega Pinzon resigned,
saying his mission had been accomplished. About 30 ELN
rebels attacked a Venezuelan border post in a raid possibly
intended as a reprisal for a Venezuelan campaign against
them.
  *  19 Dec: Police grounded 20 planes in the eastern plains
in a massive crackdown on drug smuggling.
  *  20 Dec: An American Airlines plane with 165 people on
board crashed into a mountain near Cali. While there was no
indication of rebel sabotage, the destruction of a radar
station by rebels in 1991 had made the mountain passes
dangerous to fly through at night. (The replacement radar
has been sitting in its crate for three years for fear that
it will be blown up as soon as it is installed.)
  *  26 Dec: Rebels attacked Une, only 25 miles from Bogata.
Colombia said the guerrilla war had cost $12.5 billion since
1990, including $6.8 billion in lost productivity and $3.4
billion in direct military costs.
  *  27 Dec: The government began peace talks with the small
Jaime Bateman Canon Front rebel group. The group had broken
away from the M19 rebel group when it gave up armed
resistance in 1990. Some of the 24 legislators suspected of
taking drug money contributions in their campaigns were
considering resignation in exchange for charges being
dismissed.
  *  28 Dec: The Army said it had killed 657 rebels and
captured 3,284 during 1995.
  *  29 Dec: Ten policemen were killed when 100 FARC rebels
attacked Achi. Uruguay discovered a Cali Cartel base used to
ship drugs into Europe.

PERU: ONCE MORE INTO THE HUALLAGA: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Army troops pushed once more into the Shining Path
stronghold of the upper Huallaga Valley, fighting a sharp
action on 16 Dec and pursuing the fleeing rebels into the
jungle.
     The US approved the sale of Israeli-built Kfir fighters
(with US engines) to Ecuador, sparking outrage in Lima. Peru
withdrew its ambassador to the US for consultations and said
the move would provoke a regional arms race. Ecuadorean and
Peruvian troops briefly skirmished along the Pastaza River
on 28 Dec; Peru cancelled New Year's leave for troops in the
area.
     President Fujimori said Peru had burned 30 metric tons
of cocaine and other drugs during 1995, a new record. (Only
11 tons was burned in 1994, 9.3 in 1993, 7.7 in 1992, and
6.2 in 1991.)

mid-December, but withdrew without conflict when
pro-Zapatista civilians blocked the road into Oventic. [The
rebels planned to hold their second anniversary celebration
there; the Army wanted to disrupt the celebration by
attending uninvited but showed no intent to start shooting.]
The Army swore to "maintain vigilance" and withdrew.
     The US Drug Enforcement Administration said on 19 Dec
that Mexican drug gangs might replace the devastated Cali
Cartel as the primary source of cocaine for the US.

  *  5 Dec: An envoy from opponents of Aidid asked Egypt and
the Arab League to stop Libyan support for Aidid. Fighting
broke out in Mogadishu between two sub-groups of the Habre
Gedir clan.
  *  6 Dec: Fighting broke out in Baidoa between the forces
of Aidid and the local Rahanwein clan.
  *  9 Dec: Relief groups warned that if the factions
continued to threaten their workers it would be impossible
to continue aid.
  *  10 Dec: Fighting broke out in Kismayu between Aidid's
vice president Mohamed Haji Aden and warlord Hersi Morgan.
  *  18 Dec: The radio station linked to Ali Mahdi reported
that journalists who wrote "unholy propaganda" in future
would be executed or have their hands amputated.
  *  26 Dec: Marco Lorenzetti, an Italian aid worker
kidnapped on the 18th, was released when Aidid ordered the
gang who had taken him hostage to turn him over.
Technically, Aidid "arrested and deported" Lorenzetti for
entering the country without a valid visa issued by the
"legal government" [i.e., by Aidid]. This political fiction
allowed Aidid to do a good deed for the Italians and
reinforce his dubious claim to power.

SUDAN "CANNOT FIND" MUBARAK ASSASSINS: EVENTS 1-31 DEC 95

  *  5 Dec: Sudan ended its ban on relief flights to the
rebel-held south, except to flights from Uganda (which Sudan
suspects is supporting the rebels with weapons and
munitions). Ugandan President Museveni said he would start
sending commando raids into Sudan if the Sudanese did not
stop supporting the Lord's Resistance Army's attacks on
Uganda.
  *  8 Dec: Sudan said its Army had killed 263 Ugandan
troops fighting alongside the SPLA rebels. (Uganda and the
SPLA maintain that no Ugandan soldiers have been in Sudan.)
  *  10 Dec: Sudan expelled 50 Ethiopian refugees for
subversive activities.
  *  11 Dec: Sudan called for Kuwait to normalize relations
[and resume foreign aid] cut off when Sudan supported Iraq
in the Gulf War.
  *  13 Dec: Sudan said that 70,000 Sudanese workers had
already returned from Libya and the other 230,000 would
return by February. [Sudan did not say where it will find
jobs for them.]
  *  18 Dec: Sudanese military President al-Bashir said that
he had brought the current presidents of Ethiopia and
Eritrea into power and that they had since turned against
him. Al-Bashir said that he would soon teach them "an
unforgettable lesson" for their treachery.
  *  19 Dec: The OAU called on Sudan to hand over to Egypt
the three men involved in the attempt to assassinate
Mubarak. Sudan continues to insist that it cannot locate the
men and assumes that they never entered Sudan or did so and
then left.
  *  20 Dec: Kenya asked Egypt to provide intelligence data
on camps inside Sudan harboring dissidents from many
countries, including Egypt, Morocco, Kenya, Nigeria, and
others. [The Kenyans were clearly not challenging the claim
that camps were present but simply wanted more information
in order to assess the threat posed by whatever training was
going on there.]
  *  21 Dec: Ethiopia asked the UN Security Council to force
Sudan to hand over the three men involved in the attempt to
assassinate Mubarak.
  *  29 Dec: Sudan authorized the OAU to send a fact-finding
team to investigate charges of terrorist bases in Sudan.
Ethiopia said Sudan was torturing and killing Ethiopian
refugees in Sudan.

wing of ULIMO forced peacekeepers to pull out of Tubmanburg.
After three of the peacekeepers were killed by the militias,
ECOMOG sent tanks and self-propelled artillery to pound the
town. The battle raged until New Year's eve.

RWANDA: REPATRIATION GETS SERIOUS: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

  *  19 Dec: Vice President (also Major General, also rebel
leader) Paul Kagame defended the expulsion of 43 aid
agencies because they had refused to cooperate with the
government. He said that the international community
"promises a lot, does very little, and wants our government
to solve all our complicated problems". UNSG Ghali said that
if the refugee problem is not solved, Rwanda could return to
genocide. Rwanda said this statement did not help rebuild
confidence in its government.
  *  20 Dec: Rwanda and Zaire agreed to work together to
speed up the voluntary return of one million refugees from
Zaire. UN High Commissioner Ogata pledged to do more to
repatriate them.
  *  21 Dec: The Tanzanian government ordered all refugees
in the country to return to their camps by the end of
December or face involuntary deportation. The UN said it
needed $288 million in aid for refugees from Rwanda and
Zaire.
  *  25 Dec: Six Zairean soldiers and several civilians were
killed in violence at the Goma refugee camp after a mob
killed a Zairean colonel and his troops went on a rampage.
  *  29 Dec: Zaire arrested eight prominent Rwandan Hutus
who had been hiding in refugee camps at Goma after being
accused of genocide and war crimes by the new Rwandan
government. The eight had been trying to prevent inhabitants
of the camps from going back to Rwanda.
  *  30 Dec: Gunmen shot and killed a bodyguard of exiled
Hutu millionaire Felicien Kabuga in Nairobi after he refused
to take them to Kabuga himself. Kabuga, who is very high on
the list of people Rwanda wants to prosecute (he owned the
radio station which issued the original call for genocide),
said this was part of a Tutsis plot to assassinate him.

SOUTH AFRICA: BLOODY NATAL: EVENTS 19-31 DEC 95

     Political violence between ANC and Zulu-Inkatha groups
in Natal Province (and particularly in the Kwazulu homeland
area) continued. On Christmas Day, Zulu warriors used the
classic "impi" envelopment tactics to surround a village
that was the stronghold of pro-ANC activists, killing 16
people and burning 80 homes. Human rights groups noted that
the average number of people killed in political violence
had fallen from 223 per month in 1994 to 97 per month in
1995.
     Inkatha reduced its demands for a provincial court,
militia, and justice system to "aspirations subject to
international mediation". The move, on 11 Dec, allowed
Inkatha to return to the constitutional drafting committee,
but the ANC said that the new proposal still amounted to
independence for KwaZulu.
     The UN excused South Africa from paying the $93 million
in dues it did not pay during the 20 years when its
membership was suspended.
     Rampant crime had forced dozens of neighborhoods and
business districts to form or hire vigilante groups for
security.

UNITED STATES: III CORPS, TERRORISM BILL, START-2 TREATY

     THE US ARMY has made III Corps (Fort Hood) responsible
for any war in Korea rather than the West Coast-based I
Corps. One scenario provides that the first III Corps units
to deploy would be the helicopter and artillery brigades as
these could provide key support to units already in Korea
and are easier to airlift than armored forces. In such a
contingency, the 13th Corps Support Command at Fort Hood
would manage the US end of the "air bridge" taking supplies
into Korea. That could create the first "intercontinental
corps" with its forward tactical HQ in Korea and its rear
logistical HQ in Texas.
     CONGRESS delayed action until sometime in 1996 on the
Clinton Administration's anti-terrorist bill because a broad
range of critics (liberal and conservative) fear it gives
the government entirely too much power. The bill had already
been rewritten to remove a controversial expansion to
wiretap authorizations.
     The US Senate agreed on 22 Dec not to try to amend the
START-2 Treaty before a final vote, but the vote itself was
delayed while waiting for resolution of the budget crisis.

protection against sexual violence, resources for the

     NATO: France renewed an old idea on 19 Dec, calling for

Britain) has always resisted such an idea since a European
consensus (assuming that was possible) would tie the hands
of the US (which wants to control NATO). France also wants a
separate military command for the WEU, but Britain and the
US says this would simply duplicate NATO.
     BELGIUM: Separatist rivalries burst into flames on 19
Dec when the Flemish CVP party chairman declared that his
party would not allow Belgium to be "fed by Flanders and
milked by Wallonia". [Belgium includes both French- and
Dutch-speaking provinces that have grown increasingly tired
of being in the same country over the last two decades.]
     BRITAIN: British defense contractors complained to
Parliament that the steadily-increasing cooperation between
German and French arms makers could eventually reduce the
British arms industry to irrelevancy. British industry wants
to see the new European Armaments Agency used to build
cooperation between all of the European states rather than
its current role of cutting costs on previously-agreed
projects.
     CANADA: Prime Minister Chretien named LtGen Edouard
Jean Boyle to be Chief of the Defense Staff. He will be
promoted to full (four-star) general.
     CYPRUS said on 29 Dec that it would take legal action
against Turkey if it violates the ban on trade with the
Turkish Cypriot enclave attached to its new EU trade
agreement.
     CZECH REPUBLIC: Parliament stopped plans to modernize a
number of T-72 tanks and 24 MiG-21 fighters, ordering the
military to study financial and industrial aspects of the
deal. Local industry complained that there was too much
money going to foreign companies for things that could be
made at home.
     ESTONIA finally ratified (20 Dec) the agreements with
Moscow (signed a year earlier) covering the withdrawal of
Russian troops (long since completed) and the status of
retired Russian soldiers in the country. This cleared an
obstacle to improved relations with Russia.
     FRANCE will unilaterally keep its border controls in
place rather than ending them under the Schengen Convention.
Under that agreement, seven countries (France, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Portugal, Germany, and
Belgium) were to end their internal border controls but
maintain external controls. France said that the other six
nations had failed to keep drug smugglers, terrorists, and
illegal immigrants out.
     A separatist bomb hit a public building in Corsica on
18 Dec; another destroyed three floors of a tax office in
Bastia on 24 Dec. Another bomb hit a tax office in Ajaccio
on 25 Dec. The hardline Historical Wing of the Corsican
National Liberation Front claimed both attacks. Yet another
bomb damaged a government office in Porto Vecchio on the
26th. Two more bombs exploded in Ajaccio on the 31st.
     GERMANY is investigating whether Iranian Minister of
Internal Security Ali Fallahiyan was involved in the 1992
murder of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin. Iran denied the
charge.
     HUNGARY has signed an economic cooperation agreement
with Sweden which includes studying the possible purchase of
the JAS-39 Gryphon (Gripen) fighter. This would be the first
export sale for the Gryphon.
     ITALY will try six executives of the Agusta helicopter
company for bribing government officials to secure a $500
million helicopter contract.
     MACEDONIA and Greece reached an agreement settling a
three-decade-old dispute on use of the waters of the Mesta
River on 22 Dec. Another agreement opened three new border
crossing stations to facilitate trade.
     POLAND: Less than a week before turning over power to
his rival Kwasniewski, President Walesa announced (19 Dec)
that the interior ministry had discovered that previous
President Oleksy (just selected as prime minister) was a
Russian spy. (Russia and Polish intelligence denied this,
and Poland's chief military prosecutor said there was not
even enough evidence to justify an investigation. The
documents did indicate that at least one Russian agent
considered Oleksy a "source" but that could mean anything.)
     ROMANIA: President Iliescu denied charges from an
investigative panel that he had hijacked the 1989 revolution
in order to seize power for himself and a group of
ex-communists.
     SPAIN's conservative Popular Party, which expects to
win the March elections, said it would adopt a tougher line
on forcing the return of Gibraltar to Spanish control.

MIDDLE EAST: EGYPT, LIBYA, MOROCCO, TUNISIA, YEMEN

     EGYPT: Eight hundred policemen stormed an island in
Assiut Province and burned 15 acres of poppy fields on 25
Dec. While police regularly burn such fields, this was one
of the largest such operations in recent memory.
     LIBYA: The US called (21 Dec) for stronger UN sanctions
"possibly including an oil embargo" against Libya to force
it to turn over the two men suspected of blowing up Pan Am
103. [Italy, Germany, and Spain depend on Libya for
high-quality crude oil and would suffer major economic
disruption from a Libyan oil embargo.] On the same day, the
Senate added tougher sanctions on Libya to a bill toughening
the sanctions on Iran. Gadhafy ordered defenses increased on
25 Dec to stop an expected surprise attack by US forces
based in Tunisia or Egypt.
     MOROCCO objected strongly when Algeria (which has
harbored the Polisario rebels) used its position as rotating
chairman of the Arab Maghreb Union to campaign against the
new voter registration rules for the former Spanish Sahara.
     Polisario complained that UNSG Ghali had virtually
endorsed the Moroccan version of the voter registration
rules for the referendum in the former Spanish Sahara.
     TUNISIA has opened a duty-free zone in Zarzis that
effectively gives Libya a gateway to international trade
evading the UN sanctions.
     YEMEN began the trial of a group of Islamic
fundamentalists on 17 Dec for a clash last fall in which
Three policemen were killed and 10 wounded. Of the 21 on
trial, nine are not in custody. The group had attacked a
wedding where (in contravention of strict Islamic custom)
the men in one room were able to hear the women in another
room singing. When police tried to arrest the group, a
firefight broke out.

ASIA AND THE PACIFIC: BANGLADESH, CHINA, HONG KONG,
INDONESIA, PAKISTAN, TAIWAN, TIMOR

     BANGLADESH: Violent strikes against Prime Minister
Khaleda continued, leaving hundreds injured. Tribal students
linked to the Shanti Bahini rebels in the Chittagong Hill
Tracts rioted on 21 Dec, leaving 60 injured. The US
ambassador arranged a meeting between rival party leaders on
24 Dec, the first such mediation in over a year. Police had
seized 500 weapons and arrested 5000 people in a
pre-election crackdown. Most of the organized crime gangs
had eluded arrest, however.
     CHINA declared (21 Dec) that the US media coverage of
it was "unfair and threatens to further damage relations".
China said that the US media focused on human rights, labor
camps, forced abortions, and military threats to its
neighbors instead of "the really big stories" of rural
elections, imposition of a five-day work week, and other
reforms. China issued a report on 27 Dec praising itself for
human rights advances. China arrested dozens of Beijing city
officials in late December as part of a widespread web of
corruption. The officials were known as "the princelings"
because they were children or other relatives of the party
elite.
     HONG KONG: China named a 150-member Preparatory
Committee to guide the government after the shift to Chinese
rule, but not a single member came from the Democratic
Party, the largest political party in Hong Kong.
     INDONESIA: Britain said on 19 Dec it would proceed with
the sale of 24 Hawk light attack trainers to Indonesia as it
was convinced they would not be used against rebels on
Sumatra, Timor, or Irian Jaya.
     PAKISTAN: Britain, France, Italy, and Saudi Arabia
closed their consulates in Karachi on 19 Dec due to concerns
over continued ethnic violence there. A car bomb killed 33
people in Peshawar on 22 Dec; Afghan groups were thought to
be involved. Seven Islamic religious parties called for a
nationwide strike against PM Bhutto's "incompetence and
corruption". Opposition parties demanded the removal of the
Sindh provincial government (made up by Bhutto's party)
because it could not end violence in Karachi.
     TAIWAN is interested in buying two used Dutch
submarines. Taiwan denied a report that it would develop its
own medium-range ballistic missile. President Lee said on 31
Dec that he wanted reunification with China but Taiwan must
"walk tall" and seek its own diplomatic status until that
time comes.
     TIMOR: After another wave of Timorese youth stormed
into foreign embassies in Jakarta demanding asylum,
Indonesia increased security around the diplomatic quarter.
Indonesia said on 25 Dec that it would take steps to crush
the rebellion on Timor but would not send more troops.
Simbolan said on 28 Dec that the Fretilin rebels on Timor
numbered 202 people with 94 weapons and had split into
several rival factions. Indonesia said it had spent $832
million on development projects in Timor over the last 20
years and the people had nothing to revolt about. Indonesia
continued its policy of deporting foreign reporters, aid
workers, and human rights activists who "caused trouble" on
Timor.

AFRICA: ERITREA, GAMBIA, NIGERIA

     ERITREA released the 196 Yemeni soldiers (and 17
civilians) captured during the battle of the Hanish Island
to the Red Cross; they were flown home on 30 Dec. Yemen
rejected an Eritrean offer to withdraw its troops from
Greater Hanish if Yemen withdrew its troops from the other
island.
     GAMBIA: Captain Sannah Sabally, a member of the 1994
coup, was sentenced to nine years in prison for trying to
kill Junta leader Captain Yahya Jammeh.
     NIGERIA: Police blocked a pro-democracy rally scheduled
for the 19th. The US Bishop's conference urged a ban on
non-humanitarian US aid to Nigeria. The British Commonwealth
sent a team on a fact-finding mission to Nigeria; the
Nigerian government welcomed the team but said it must
respond to charges that it was unfair to suspend Nigeria's
Commonwealth membership. Nigeria filed its claim to the
oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula (disputed with Cameroon) with the
World Court on 21 Dec. The UN General Assembly condemned
Nigeria on 22 Dec. General Abache ruled out any idea of
reinstating the annulled 1993 elections.

LATIN AMERICA: ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHILE, PANAMA, VENEZUELA

     ARGENTINA: The Argentine Army is so short of cash it is
leasing a barracks to be used as a supermarket for $101,000
per month.
     BRAZIL: Human Rights Watch  and Amnesty International
said there had been progress in Brazil during 1995 but
abuses by police and soldiers continued.
     CHILE: General Pinochet said he would remain head of
the Chilean military until tensions with the civilian
government eased.
     PANAMA: President Ernesto Perez Balladares fired
National Police commandeer Oswaldo Fernandez on 19 Dec and
replaced him with National Security Chief Jose Luis Sosa
after reports of an impending coup.
     VENEZUELA: Francisco Arias Cardenas, mastermind of the
4 Feb 92 military coup, won election as the governor of the
oil-rich Zulia state on 11 Dec.
