<BR>

As a precaution against those who have no right to your invested
dollars, there are many circumstances when Kemper will require you to
provide a signature guarantee.
<BR><BR>

A signature guarantee is a certification that attests to the genuineness
of your signature. The financial institution that you obtain the
guarantee from - which could be a commercial bank, trust company,
federal savings bank, savings institution, member of a national
securities exchange or other type of eligible financial institution -
warrants that you as the signer are an "appropriate" person and that you
have "legal capacity" to sign. 
<BR><BR>

This certification goes beyond what a notary public provides. A notary
attests only to the fact that he or she witnessed an individual sign a
document. Because a notary public does not guarantee that the individual
who signed the document truly is who he or she says he is, Kemper does
not accept a notarized document where a signature guarantee is required.
<BR><BR>

These are a few examples of when you'll be asked to provide a signature
guarantee:
<BR><BR>

<UL>
<LI> When you request any change in the registration of your mutual fund
account. 
<LI> When you add certain privileges to an existing account.
<LI> When you redeem more than $50,000 from your account or when you redeem
any amount and request that the check be mailed to a different address
than is shown on the account's registration.
<LI> When you redeem an account and request that the check be mailed to an
address that has been changed within the previous 30 days.
</UL>
