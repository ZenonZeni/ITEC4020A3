<H2>1st CEOS Working Group on Information Systems &amp; Services (WGISS)
Meeting 13-16/11/95, Moscow <BR>
<HR></H2>
<BR>
Attendance: about 50. See list <BR>
<BR>
<U>1. Introductions</U> <BR>
<BR>
Hosts Russian Space Agency.* and Hydrological/Meteorological Service, Roshydromet*,
gave greetings. <BR>
<BR>
Chair (H Wood), Vice Chairs (H Kikuchi, G Szejwach), gave brief welcomes.
Jeff Kingwell did likewise, on behalf of CEOS Chair. <BR>
<BR>
* Dr Y Milov, deputy director of RSA, gave this address. <BR>
<BR>
+ Dr S Avdjushin, of Roshydromet gave this address. <BR>
<BR>
Attending were many Russian and Ukrainian user agencies - Fisheries, Forests,
Oceans, Disaster Management, and others. <BR>
<BR>
Refer <B>Document 1, 2</B> for meeting agenda and information. <BR>
<BR>
2. WGINS <BR>
<BR>
This was a final summary of the interim Working Group on International Network
Services, which is now subsumed in WGISS. The presentation was made by Hiroshi
Kikuchi. <BR>
<BR>
Group Emphasised <BR>
<BR>
&#183; coherent top down strategy <BR>
<BR>
&#183; project/target oriented activities giving visible evidence of progress,
value of investment <BR>
<BR>
&#183; user driven, client oriented <BR>
<BR>
Noted that CSIRO's network demonstrator proposal is consistent with these
concepts. <BR>
<BR>
S. Sobue reported on the &quot;Yellow Pages for On-line Services&quot; concept.
<BR>
<BR>
(see <B>Document 18</B>) <BR>
<BR>
This is a directory of EO on-line resources. Initially, NASA/DLR/NASDA have
contributed to print version; on-line version is being developed. <BR>
<BR>
3. WGD <BR>
<BR>
As for WGINS, this was last report, since WGD is now subsumed in WGISS.
<BR>
<BR>
<U>3.1 CEOS Information Systems</U> <BR>
<BR>
Luigi Fusco presented plans for next 1-2 years, including; <BR>
<BR>
-encouraging, and providing technical support, for members' entries (ditto
affiliates such as IGBP). <BR>
<BR>
-upgrading Dossiers via Task Team work. <BR>
<BR>
<U>3.2 Purge Alert</U> <BR>
<BR>
Levin Lauritson - CEOS Infor Sys home page so organisation can register
with and post messages to Purge Alert Bulletin Board. This gives international
EO community the chance to 'rescue' any data no longer required by the custodian.
<BR>
<BR>
<U>Action 1</U> <BR>
<BR>
CSIRO EOC to register (currently only open to members of WGISS) <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action 2</U> <BR>
<BR>
COSSA to bring to attention of CSDC co-ordinating sub-committee <BR>
<BR>
Refer <B>Document 11.</B> <BR>
<BR>
<U>3.3 CCSDS Archive Meeting Report (Co-ordinating Committee on Space Data
Systems)</U> <BR>
<BR>
Wyn Cudlip reported on the 'digital archive model&quot; developed at this
meeting. Refer <B>Document 7</B>. <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action 3</U> <BR>
<BR>
COSSA to Report on the meeting conclusions to CSDC co-ordinating subcommitee.
<BR>
<BR>
I noted adoption of the high-level concepts such as self-describing archive
granules; use of special languages (eg PVL); and standard granule structure
(Standard Formatted Data Unit) in the CSIRO/BOM project on Australian HRPT
archive standard, carried out by Peter Turner. This would be a good case
study for CCSDS. <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action 4</U> <BR>
<BR>
COSSA to offer to report on HRPT archive standard at CSDC. <BR>
<BR>
<U>3.4 World Data Centres Conference</U> <BR>
<BR>
Martha Maiden gave an intersting description of the ICSU-sponsored World
Data Centres meeting, at which she gave a presentation on CEOS IDN. The
WDCs are re-examining their role as they emerge from Cold War context. They
decided to add WDC home pages to one or all of: <BR>
<BR>
- NASA Master Directory (NB this is more extensive than GCMD, includes space
science data) <BR>
<BR>
- CIESIN <BR>
<BR>
- CEOS IDN/CEOS Information Systems. Refer <B>Document 31</B> <BR>
<BR>
4. Sub-group reports <BR>
<BR>
NOTE The WGISS structure is not yet finalised. For the time being, the former
sub-groups of WGD are continuing, but they are not formally 'WGISS' subgroups
yet. <BR>
<BR>
<U>4.1 Catalog Sub-group (CS)</U> <BR>
<BR>
George Saxton reported that CS is organised as 6 task teams; (Refer <B>Document
5</B>) <BR>
<BR>
i). International Directory Network (IDN), led by Lola Olsen of NASA. The
IDN now comprises 4 co-ordinating nodes (NASA, NASDA, ESA, UNEP/GRID), 10
co-operating nodes and 5 future nodes Australia plus Brazil, China, New
Zealand and Russia. <BR>
<BR>
CEOS Inventory; <BR>
<BR>
ii). CEOS Inventory Interoperabilty Experiment (CINTEX), led by DLR, serves
as an international test bed for catalog interoperabilty techniques and
protocols. <BR>
<BR>
Meets by telecom monthly. (CINTEX) interacts with IDN, to investigate IDN/CINTEX
interoperablility. Eumetsat, Spot Image and EurImage are now members. <BR>
<BR>
It is merging IMS with ESU-UIT as it becomes more operational (&quot;CINTOP&quot;).
<BR>
<BR>
Fusco demanded a stronger user evaluation of CINTEX. <BR>
<BR>
CINTEX still depends on protocol bridges eg between IMS and UIT, so a user
is tricked into thinking they are the same. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the protocols supporting CINTEX (CINTOP will themselves change (eg
IMS V.0). Although CINTEX/CINTOP is vital for expanding present day communication,
there is a need to develop a unified high level protocol for new internationally
interoperable catalog and access systems for EO data. This is done by Protocol
Definition Task Team (see below) <BR>
<BR>
iii). Protocol Definition Task Team <BR>
<BR>
This is specifically a Catalogue Interoperabliltiy Protocol (CIP), of which
Version A will be available December 1995 (inventory search). A Version
B (protocol definition including browse, data product ordering, security
and user authentication), will be available June 1996. <BR>
<BR>
iv.) World Wide Web Task Team <BR>
<BR>
A new team, led by Yoon Sook Enloe at Goddard. It coordinates implementation
of WWW access to international Earth Science data systems. Holds monthly
telecons. This activity is highly relevant to the CSIRO Earth Observation
Centre, as it establishes its Web data system. Note that Luigi Fusco (ESA)
very critical of avoidance of Hyper-G as the WWW language/search tool, in
the WWW Task Teams. <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action</U> - Flag &quot;Birds of a feather&quot; remote sensing session
at Fifth WWW Conference, Paris, May 1996 <BR>
<BR>
v). Browse Task Team <BR>
<BR>
This will be led by NASDA. The team is testing 3 client server models for
Browse interoperability and will present results of this comparision, as
a component of the CIP (Catalogue Interoperability Protocol) User Requirements
Document. <BR>
<BR>
vi). Guidelines Task Team <BR>
<BR>
Led by BNSC, this group is reviewing Catologue subgroup &quot;guidelines&quot;
document on Internationally Interoperable Catalogue Systems. <BR>
<BR>
Next meetings of CS; <BR>
<BR>
a). CS16 with all four subgroups (and probably WGISS 2), Hatoyama, late
May 1996, including 4th CINTEX/Protocol Workshop. <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action</U> Kingwell to arrange: <BR>
<BR>
A). appointment of CSIRO Project Manager for Plenary Demonstrators in time
for PM to plan Plenary Demonstrators Task Team meeting at Hatoyama in May
<BR>
<BR>
B). CSIRO EOC to arrange adequate participation at Hatoyama. Suggest invitation
to P. Turner (FS/HRPT archive), M Wilson (CS/WWW/CINTEX): and Plenary Demo.
Project Manager (CINTEX/Protocol and special Task Team meeting). <BR>
<BR>
(b). CS17 tentatively September 96 at Sioux Falls. <BR>
<BR>
(c). CS18 tentatively April 97 at Toulouse. <BR>
<BR>
<U>4.2 Networks Sub group (NS)</U> <BR>
<BR>
Kohei Arai reported. Professor Arai (Saga University) has been appointed
as a NASDA Project Scientist, to assist in chairing the NS. <BR>
<BR>
Agencies have raised concern about Network security. The subgroup has prepared
a guidelines document, available on web. <BR>
<BR>
Either there was no written report or I didn't get one: <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action</U> Kingwell to check on NS written report, with Kohei Arai. <BR>
<BR>
Security guidelines URL; <BR>
<BR>
msipo.nasa.gos or v.pub/security/.docs. (I tried this; it is not a correct
URL) <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action</U> Advise CSDC of the CEOS Network Security document. <BR>
<BR>
<U>Comment</U> NS may become an appropriate &quot;host group&quot; for the
Plenary Demonstrator, if one is required. <BR>
<BR>
Kikuchi expressed <BR>
<BR>
- support for ESCAP network feasibility study 1995 ('ESINAP') based on Kingwell
et al pre-feasibility study, 1995 <BR>
<BR>
- support for Arai as NASDA project scientist and co-chair of NS. <BR>
<BR>
<U>4.3 Auxiliary Data subgroup</U> <BR>
<BR>
Refer <B>Documents 3,4</B> <BR>
<BR>
Gunther Schreier summarised: <BR>
<BR>
-IDN/DIF structure for auxiliary datasets <BR>
<BR>
-Reviewed DIF keywords, CIESIN activity <BR>
<BR>
Glossary <BR>
<BR>
1-km AVHRR <BR>
<BR>
Future activity in greenhouse sources &amp; sinks <BR>
<BR>
<U>Globe</U> 1 km DEM. <BR>
<BR>
Map projections (new task team to review status of current map projections
for EO, and innovative approaches). <BR>
<BR>
ADS Reference Document (refer <B>Document 12</B> for this valuable summary
of auxiliary data sets being used with Earth Observation data products).
<BR>
<BR>
<U>Action</U> <BR>
<BR>
- Table at CSDC <BR>
<BR>
- Suggest NRIC/ERIN/AUSLIG involvement in supply of information. <BR>
<BR>
- Provide feedback to ADS by 3/12/95 <BR>
<BR>
After December, document will go into CEOS InfoSys. This is Volume 1 of
ADC documentation. Volume II is &quot;Guidelines &amp; Recommendations&quot;.
This will be released for review at WGISS 2 (May 96, Japan) Note WGISS 3
will be 2 October 1996 (Germany). <BR>
<BR>
On map projections, Schreier made the point that these have been devised
for displaying data for the human viewer. However we require for EO data
more than 2 D representation:- <BR>
<BR>
- 3 Spatial dimensions <BR>
<BR>
- temporal dimension <BR>
<BR>
- polarimetric, spectral dimensions <BR>
<BR>
Approach is to choose whether:- <BR>
<BR>
- to develop 'ideal' mapping schema for spherical projection <BR>
<BR>
- recommend existing 'standard' for 2D spherical projection <BR>
<BR>
- develop 'on demand mapping' approach (append enough navigation information
to EO products to allow computers to supply to any nominated projection.
<B>Document 3</B> discusses this further; the concept of 'on the fly' processing
of raw data retained in 'native space' seems to be preferred by many on
ADS). See also reference to SPICE geolocation tool (P5-6). <BR>
<BR>
The projection task force is joint ADS/FS. It will develop specification,
public domain software to implement projection task team members welcome.
Meeting proposed around Jan/Feb 1996 in Huntsville USA or Munich. Contact
is Gunther Schreier. Further discussion will take place in Hatoyama meeting,
May 1996. <BR>
<BR>
Proposed new ADS Web Project &quot;Earth on Line&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
This is a &quot;Yellow Pages&quot; for on-line services in reverse; <BR>
<BR>
lists auxiliary data sets according to discipline (eg atmosphere models;
DEMS) and wraps them in a coherent access model. To be conducted with WWW
Task Team of CS. <BR>
<BR>
Covered CEC project to define a set of global products building upon the
Global I Km AVHRR land data project. <BR>
<BR>
These include 16 parameter land classification; population density, others.
<BR>
<BR>
<U>Globe</U> Global Land One km Base Elevation <BR>
<BR>
Established global 1km land surface digital elevation model. <BR>
<BR>
Based in part on Defence Mapping Agency data recently released, partly as
a result of this project. Future Space Shuttle mission will help. Schreier
noted recent agreement with Australian (AUSLIG?) on royalty-free access
to 1 km resolution elevation data for local area. The sub-group is considering
a complementory 1 km global ocean bathymetric data project. <BR>
<BR>
CIESIN developments include nomination as a World Data Center A for Human
Interactions in the Environment (CIESIN browser is on IDN). Also CHARLOTTE
(http://Sedac.ciesin. org/sedac - 2.3/mvas.home/mvas-home.html) for generating
html pages on the fly. Other CIESIN data sets (1 km population, for example
may be of interest to many.) <BR>
<BR>
5. Demonstration Projects <BR>
<BR>
Helen commented that she has introduced this new agenda concept to make
sure WGISS stays active and informed. <BR>
<BR>
<U>5.1 Ocean Color</U> <BR>
<BR>
a). Peter Churchill spoke on ISPRA/JRC project to compile, on one server,
information on ocean color instruments, missions, experiments, and validation.
Member input is encouraged. <BR>
<BR>
b). John Withrow (IOC) spoke about new IOC proposal (previously discussed
with CSIRO and others) to conduct pilot project like the 1 km AVHRR Land
Data project, to map either globally or on regional basis to areas of ocean
productivity. Refer <B>Document 21</B>. This benefits from CZCS experience,
viz; <BR>
<BR>
&#183; improved spectral coverage, sensitivity, leading to improved final
products. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; improved data validation in coastal and optically complex waters
. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; better software tools, algorithms and data distribution. <BR>
<BR>
<U>5.2. CEOS Plenary Network Demonstrator</U> <BR>
<BR>
Jeff Kingwell (CSIRO) spoke on network (real time data: real time QL; real
time catalogue interoperability) demonstrator plan for 10th CEOS Plenary,
November 1996. Refer <B>Document 38, 40</B>. <BR>
<BR>
The idea was strongly supported (Fisco, Lauritson, Saxton, Kikuchi). <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action</U> - CSIRO to select Project Manager. Task Team to be selected,
meet at Hatoyama/Tokyo in May 1996. NASDA has agreed to cover participants
travel costs, and data transfer costs from Japan to Canberra. <BR>
<BR>
<U>5.3 CSIRO CD ROM training package</U> <BR>
<BR>
a). Kingwell gave an explanation of the Earth Observation training package
of case studies and data sets for schools and developing countries. <B>Refer
Document 39.</B> <BR>
<BR>
There was an extremely enthusiastic response from Asia-Pacific agencies,
with the State Meteorological Administration (Professor Xu) particularly
supportive and anxious to participate . Fire monitoring: earthquake prediction,
in particular, would be excellent case studies. <BR>
<BR>
Dr Fusco suggested including the CEOS InfoSys in toto, as a reference set
of EO contacts, dictionary etc. This seems a great idea. (Volume &quot;a
few Mb&quot;.) <BR>
<BR>
Levin Lauritson volunteered a GOES movie loop (Carribean Hurricanes), hopefully
with commentary /class activity suggestions. <BR>
<BR>
<U>Note</U> CSIRO would also try to include the Victorian Geography Teacher's
Association lesson material based on &quot;AusWatch&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
Gunther Schreier (DLR), although somewhat critical of concept not going
far enough (of the &quot;Information Locator Service&quot;), suggested that
Jean-Paul Malingreau's work on a TREES CD could be included in part. <BR>
<BR>
Alan Haskell (DRA) provided reference documents for ERS (refer <B>Document
16, 17</B>). These can be included (Kingwell has to write to Haskell acknowledging
our agreement). This would cross-reference with any ERS data extracted from
latest ESA CD. <BR>
<BR>
<U>Action</U> MAW/JK/Smith Systems to follow up these sources. <BR>
<BR>
Note: The case studies (ICE classification, oil exploration) seen at NPO
would be excellent CD case studies <BR>
<BR>
6. WGISS 5 Year Plan <BR>
<BR>
Alan Haskell led initial discussion. Plan is a compromise between desire
for strategic thinking ('top down&quot; approach), and practical considerations,
such as fact that sub group projects , and all CEOS work, is voluntary.
This means in practice that people are inclined to do what they are interested
in, not what needs to be done. <BR>
<BR>
Participants broke into small drafting/discussion groups, initially to examine
work prackages, then to consider specific projects. <BR>
<BR>
Several things emerged; <BR>
<BR>
&#183; how to emphasise 'service view' through enhanced and broader client
consultation, more network tools (eg locators). <BR>
<BR>
&#183; how to interact with other extensive data networks, such as GTS and
its future enhancements. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; is the 'work package' approach valid for a best efforts organisation
It was derived in context of managing consultants or work teams. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; several areas need more emphasis; real time data; co-ordination of
ground station operations, for instance. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; plan should show the big picture, not just detail <BR>
<BR>
A writing committee (Ward, Haskell, Mather, Kingwell, Wolf, Fusco, Lauritson)
was asked to prepare version 0.3, based on inputs from the meeting. <BR>
<BR>
7. Technical Tour of NPO Planeta <BR>
<BR>
Planeta is part of the Russian Hydrological and Meteorological Service,
Roshydromet, responsible for designing, building and operating meteorological
satellite sensors. Planeta employs about 600 people in at least 3 sites;
Moscow and ground stations north of Moscow and Novosibisk. It receives data
from GOMS (geostationary satellite over Indian Ocean), Resource, NOAA, and
the Russian/Ukrainian real aperture Okean 1 &amp; 2. <BR>
<BR>
Planeta co-operates with NASA (TOMS ozone instrument on Meteor); DLR (integrating
Planeta data catalogue on ISIS system); ESA (ERS reception planned); SPOT
(SPOT reception planned; and the Russian Space Agency, which contracts (co-funds)
the organisation as part of the national space program. <BR>
<BR>
GOMS appears to be operating nominally, with hourly data received. These
and other satellite data, are sent by modem to various institutions. Some
information is distributed over the GTS directly from Planeta. <BR>
<BR>
In the software and applications development laboratory, projects demonstrated
included ice monitoring for ice breaker operations; oil exploration; land
cover type and classification.(Any of these would be ideal for the CSIRO
CD ROM). <BR>
<BR>
The first uses Okean radar and passive microwave. Ice analysis based on
these are transmitted by satellite to ice breakers in both polar areas.
<BR>
<BR>
The second used Resource data over Siberia to look for hydrocarbon seepage.
The third used a variety of satellite data (Resource, NOAA, others). <BR>
<BR>
Planeta has developed a PC(DOS) based catalogue system which can be accessed
by external users. It gives a simple screen (similar to ISIS, IMS, MUIS)
which allows a search by date, acquisition site, satellite/sensor, geographic
location, or polygon. <BR>
<BR>
The system was established over the last three years. <BR>
<BR>
The systems shows details of frames + intersecting the search area, including
numerical cloud cover. It also shows in graphic form the extent of overlap,
allowing for sensor geometry. <BR>
<BR>
Planeta are building an interface between their catalogue and the Unix based
ISIS, using equipment provided by DARA (comprising the first Unix system
at Planeta). <BR>
<BR>
The overall impression was that of a highly capable and motivated group,
successfully operating a wide variety of satellite data systems in adverse
economic circumstances, and somewhat limited computing facilities. <BR>
<BR>
+ Because the orbits of Russian satellites can be less regular than, say,
Landsat and SPOT, the Russians define data granules by 'frames' rather that
'scenes'. Frames are defined by segmenting each orbit - on successive orbits,
frame dimensions may vary. <BR>
