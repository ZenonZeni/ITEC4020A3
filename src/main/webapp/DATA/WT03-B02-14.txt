HISTORIC US GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN ENDS

WASHINGTON, DC - The 21 day partial US federal government shutdown
ended 5 January 1996, when president Bill Clinton signed legislation
that temporarily brings back to work one-quarter of a million people
furloughed during a budget impasse. A compromise was reached with the
Republican party-controlled Congress agreeing to back-pay the
furloughed federal employees, as well as the nearly half million who
were working without full pay since 16 December 1995. The president and
Congress had been at an impasse to agree on a seven year plan to
balance the budget by the year 2002 and which programmes and taxes
would be decreased to accomplish that goal.

This furlough followed a one-week shutdown in November and is only
resolved until the temporary legislation runs out on 26 January.
Federal employees will not be secure in their jobs or funding of the
programmes they run until departmental appropriation bills are passed
and signed by the president. Although Clinton has put forth a balanced
budget, with figures validated by the Congressional Budget Office, the
Democratic and Republican parties remain far apart in their views about
entitlement programmes and the role of the federal government vis-a-vis
the states.

While IHN predicted a collision course between the president and the
congress on Medicare and Medicaid (IHN 6, November, 1995, page 1), IHN
did not expect federal employees to be held hostage. These two
programmes, however, are major points of contention along with tax cuts
and welfare reform. The table illustrates the differences in savings
for the four programmes projected by the president and Congress at the
conclusion of talks on 7 January.

Programmes            Clinton savings       Republican savings

Medicare              $102 billion          $201 billion
Medicaid              $52 billion           $117 billion
Tax cuts              $87 billion           $241 billion
Welfare               $45 billion           $82 billion

Sources: Congressional Budget Office, White House

While the Department of Health and Human Services is still without an
approved budget, the 5 January agreement did provide funding through 30
September, the end of this fiscal year, for the National Institutes of
Health (NIH) and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and
several other health agencies. The Food and Drug Administration, by the
way, was unaffected because it was under the Department of
Agriculture's previously appropriated budget.

The shutdown has long-term rippling effects for the healthcare sector.
For example, researchers at nearly 1,700 hospitals and university
research centres are unable to begin or continue projects funded by NIH
grants. Wendy Baldwin, NIH grants supervisor said, "It is going to take
months to straighten out the backlog."

HOECHST MARION ROUSSEL RESTRUCTURES IN 1996

FRANKFURT -- Hoechst Marion Roussel (HMR) recently announced its 1996
plans for worldwide restructuring. HMR plans to abolish 8,000 jobs this
year; about one-third of the losses will be in Europe (1,400 in
Germany), 20 per cent in North America, and 25 per cent in the Asian,
Pacific region. The company currently employs 43,000 people. About 40
per cent of the job cuts will be in manufacturing and about half will
be administrative and sales staff.

"Hoechst is no longer a German company with an international business,
but an international multi-cultural company with headquarters in
Germany", claims HMR spokesman, Joachim Pietzsch, when describing the
current state of the company's affairs.  "The traditional German
chemical company founded in 1863 in a village near Frankfurt is now
undergoing dramatic changes. In a few years drugs will be only
connected with Hoechst Marion Roussel instead of just Hoechst."

Since Jurgen Dormann took over as managing director in April 1994, the
company has concentrated on the three core areas of pharmaceuticals,
plant protection and industrial chemistry. Major acquisitions and
several co-operative arrangements have been made in these areas, while
cosmetic and chemical companies have been sold.

In July 1995, Hoechst acquired the American pharmaceutical company
Marion Merrel Dow for $7.1 billion. This was the largest acquisition
ever made by a German company. Several years ago, Hoechst purchased the
French company Roussel and the restructuring marks an overhaul and
integration of its drug division.

Increase profit margins by 30 per cent

The restructuring, estimated to cost about DM1.1 billion ($758.6
million), is expected to increase drug profit margins by 30 per cent
over three years. The plan calls for reducing the number of HMR's drug
production sites to 40, about half of the current number. There will be
four research centres: Frankfurt (Germany), Romainville (France),
Sommerville (US) and Kawagoe (Japan). These centres will focus on the
mechanisms and therapeutic options for cardiovascular, metabolic,
infectious and oncological diseases, as well as ailments of the bones
and central nervous and respiratory systems. A centre will be closed in
each of the following cities: Cincinatti (US), Strasbourg (France),
Swindon (UK) and Gerenzano, Italy.

Frankfurt will keep its dominant position, said director Karl-Gerhard
Seifert, who is responsible for HMR's pharmaceutical business. He will
work with a multi-cultural executive committee of 12 managers. A drug
development centre will be established in Sommerville, New Jersey and
the centre will be responsible for marketing, business development and
drug submissions.

The strategic aim is to register two new drugs per year. Drug
submissions will be expedited by continuous data transfer between the
centres of HMR.

"We have 15 top projects", said Pietzsch. Three of them are in the area
of gene technology: Hirudin, Factor XIII and human insulin. In the
past, Hoechst was not a major player in gene therapy, but with HMR
centres on the US east coast and several co-operative arrangements with
small, specialised biotechnology companies, HMR currently has a strong
involvement in genome research.

UK APPROVES FIRST PRIVATELY FUNDED HOSPITAL PROJECT

LONDON - A privately financed #35 million ($39.7 million) scheme to
reconstruct hospitals in England's Buckinghamshire region has been
approved by the government. The scheme is the first in which a
substantial sum of private finance is to be used to design and rebuild
hospital facilities for the publicly-funded National Health Service
(NHS).

The Secretary of State for Health, Stephen Dorrell, said that the
project marked a turning point for the government's private finance
initiative (PFI) in the health service. He added that he was strongly
in favour of testing public and private sector solutions alongside each
other and adopting the approach which offered the best value.

The contract, which involves a substantial amount of rebuilding at two
of the South Buckinghamshire NHS Trust's hospitals has been awarded to
the Healthcare Group consortium, comprising builders Taylor Woodrow,
the motorway service station operator Granada and financiers, Nexus.
Work is expected to begin in April and take two years to complete. Mr
Dorrell said all clinical services would continue to be provided by the
NHS, but maintenance would be the responsibility of the private sector
partner.

The project is expected to be the first of many large-scale private
sector schemes in the NHS, with the government expecting private
investment to rise from #47 million this year to #165 million in the
1996-1997 year. Even with such a large increase in private investment,
however, the total amount of funding available for capital projects is
still expected to fall.

Mr Dorrell has announced that government expenditure on capital
projects for hospitals and community health services is to be cut by
almost 17 per cent next year, to #1.54 billion. This is expected to
result in a fall of 6.5 per cent in overall funding available for
capital development in real terms in the 1996-1997 year, and a drop of
3.7 per cent in the following year.

The NHS Executive has so far approved 44 PFI schemes, with a total
capital value of around #166 million.

SWISS INSURANCE COMPANIES TAKE AIM AT PRIVATE HOSPITAL TREATMENT

GENEVA - A group of leading Swiss insurance companies has declared war
on the high cost of health treatment in the country by introducing a
"carrot and stick" approach to get patients to switch to cheaper
private hospitals and clinics. The 13 companies belonging to COSAMA
(Conference suisse des assurers maladie et accidents) have fired the
first broadside in the Canton (state) of Vaud - where they control half
the health insurance market.

The insurance companies have drawn up a list of 11 hospitals and
clinics and told clients their premiums will be cut by 10 per cent if
they go to these places for treatment. If they choose other
establishments, there will be a surcharge of 40 per cent on their
premiums. Moreover, COSAMA has told the 11 hospitals and clinics to cut
their tariffs by 10 per cent, arguing they will gain from getting more
patients at their competitors' expense.

The move, however, has run into difficulties. All the establishments
belong to the GHRV (Groupement des hopitaux regionaux vaudois) and AVCP
(Association vaudoise des cliniques privees), which have urged its
members to stick together; otherwise some hospitals and clinics will be
forced to close. So far, however, only one of the clinics on the
approved list has agreed to COSAMA's proposal. While it remains to be
seen who will win this battle, COSAMA has said it plans to extend the
new policy to other cantons in Switzerland.

This action comes when the face of healthcare in Switzerland has been
transformed radically. From 1 January 1996, government subsidies to
insurance companies to hold down premiums were scrapped. One immediate
result has been a huge rise in insurance costs for most families.

The companies claim that cutting the subsidies has cost them SFr1.9
million ($1.54 million). In addition, they are now obliged to cover the
cost of treatment for a variety of illnesses in the public sector,
which they claim will cost another SFr1.7 billion. As a result,
premiums are increasing typically by 40, even 50 per cent.

Lower-income groups will receive subsidies towards their health
insurance costs, but the responsibility for deciding who is eligible
has been given to the cantons. There are, however, considerable
differences in the way the cantons are making their selection. This has
led to demands in parliament for a SFr500 million handout to families.

FRENCH HEALTH INSURERS TO STUDY COST CONTAINMENT

PARIS - The state-owned life insurer, Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance,
is creating a unit to study cost containment. The unit will analyse
costs and treatments to provide the insurer with typical pictures of
various diseases and conditions. The intention is to identify which
treatments are useful and which are not, with a view to offering
clients cheaper but effective cover.

The unit will also seek to improve cost effectiveness by verifying the
efficacy of treatments and seeking the post-treatment opinion of
patients. The unit is expected to develop methods that will save more
money than they cost.

According to the insurer, the legal requirements for data protection
and medical secrecy are to be respected by the unit. The study may face
resistance from patients who are accustomed to spending for and seeking
healthcare as they like. Moreover, physicians may not be pleased to see
their income constrained.

The company's director of collective insurances, Patrick Warin, noted
that health insurers were interested in containing healthcare costs,
although those that provide supplementary insurance do not pay much
more than 10 per cent of the total healthcare bill. Because these
insurers pay the portion of the health bill not covered by the
government, they are often accused of encouraging overspending. He
added that insurers also need to contain costs, because government
decisions about reimbursement levels directly affect their business.

BURE ACQUIRES PREVIA

STOCKHOLM - The Scandinavian venture capital company Bure Ab has
cemented its position as Sweden's largest private healthcare services
provider in the aftermath of its $25 million acquisition of Previa, in
a deal finalised on 14 December. Bure will, following the take-over,
merge Previa with the group's other healthcare subsidiary Bygghalsan to
create a new company with annual revenues in excess of $94 million and
with a 20 per cent share of the rapidly expanding market for private
healthcare services in Sweden.

The new company, Previa Halsan Ab, will specialise in providing pre-
employment checks, routine and call-out medical services to companies
in the private and state sectors. Bure has drafted a five-year
development plan for Previa Halsan under which the company is expected
to increase revenues, through a process of mergers and acquisitions, to
$160 million within three years.

A similar growth pattern is planned for Bure's General Healthcare
Division, based in Stockholm, and forecast to double its annual
revenues to $806 million over the next three years.

In November, Bure acquired a 70 per cent stake in Malardiagnostik Ab, a
company engaged in the operation of private healthcare clinics. Shares
were acquired from the Svrmland District Council. As part of the deal,
Bure bought a minority 40 per cent holding in the Svrmland District
Council owned healthcare centre company Sormlandshalsan. The acquired
assets have annual revenues of $20 million.

FRENCH ACQUISITION OF AUSTRALIAN HOSPITAL COMPANY

CANBERRA - The Australian Treasurer and the country's Foreign
Investment Review Board have approved the purchase by the French
conglomerate, Compagnie des Eaux, of a major Australian hospital group.
Australian Medical Enterprises owns nine hospitals in New South Wales
and Western Australia and 60 per cent of private pathology services in
the latter state.

Some disquiet has arisen among some Australian parliamentarians over
whether it is in the national interest that a foreign company, and
particularly a French company, should acquire such a large share of the
Australian health industry. The government was unmoved by these
arguments and rejected the suggestion that approval of the French
purchase had weakened its stand on the French nuclear tests in the
Pacific.

ARJO UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT

STOCKHOLM - Deliberate errors made in the accounts of the American
subsidiary of Swedish healthcare and medical equipment group Arjo, has
led to the firing of the US company's chief executive-officer, chief
financial officer and senior sales personnel. According to an audit
conducted by Arjo in November, the sales figures for Arjo Inc, based in
Morton Grove, Illinois, were "grossly inflated" by over $6 million,
approximating around 10 per cent of the company's total annual
revenues.

The audit found that incorrectly invoiced goods were in actuality
relocated to a leasing company owned by Arjo Inc. The discovery has
caused Arjo to revise its profit estimate for 1994. In August, the
company projected earnings for that year of around $32.5 million. Arjo
is estimating revenues of $240 million in 1995.

"The problems encountered with Arjo Inc will mean that we must invest
$30 million to restructure the company and get it working the way we
want. This cost will wipe out our profit result for 1995. What we are
doing is cleaning up in Arjo. Order and morality are badly needed in
the company," said Carl Bennet, chief executive officer of Gettinge Ab,
which acquired Arjo in a deal worth $130 million last November.

CANADIAN RED CROSS UNVEILS SELF-SUFFICIENT BLOOD STRATEGY

VANCOUVER - The Canadian Red Cross has unveiled a strategy to make
Canada self-sufficient in blood plasma in l996. A new state- of-the-art
blood collection facility in Thunder Bay Ontario will open as soon as
it receives approval from US Food and Drug Administration and the
Canadian Bureau of Biologics.

The facility is a plasmapheresis centre, where blood is collected from
donors and centrifuged at bedside into red corpuscle and plasma
components. The corpuscles are returned to the donor. The process takes
twice as long as the normal 30 minutes for whole blood donation, but
the donor can donate as often as once a week.

The Red Cross plans seven such centres across the country, each
enrolling 4,000 donors committed to donate 15 times a year. When the
system is operational, by the end of l998, it will produce over 400,000
litres of plasma annually, the total Canadian requirement.

Previously, the Red Cross did plasmapheresis as well as whole blood
collection at its l7 regional centres. But in July l995, the FDA
blocked shipments of "source" plasma collected via plasmapheresis
because of failure to meet US standards. Thus, the Red Cross had to
increase its use of recovered plasma, from whole blood, which is
shipped to the US to meet the terms of an agreement the Red Cross
signed with Bayer Corp 10 years ago.

The Canadian Red Cross is building, in partnership with Bayer, a C$300
million ($217.4 million) plasma fractionation plant at Bedford, Nova
Scotia, with Red Cross money and Bayer technology. The joint (non-
profit) venture is named the Canadian Red Cross Fractionation Corp
(FraCo). Bayer has the right to purchase all surplus fractions and all
of Factor VIII. This clotting factor, when purified, is valuable, worth
about C$1.5 million per gram.

Critics wonder, in light of these facts, whether the traditional
Canadian system of free donation of blood can continue to provide the
volume needed.

Melvyn Green, counsel for the Krever Commission which is inquiring into
blood collection, asked, "Is there not a risk that volunteer donors in
Canada will be deterred from donating by the knowledge that their Gift
of Life is in fact enriching a for-profit American corporation?" Steven
Vick, project director for FraCo, admits that if the collection centres
do not get sufficient volunteer donors, payment for plasma donations
will have to be considered.

EU'S 4TH FRAMEWORK HEALTH TELEMATICS PROJECTS SET TO BEGIN

BRUSSELS - This month work begins by the winners of the European
Union's Fourth Framework research and development programme. Some 70
health sector projects have been selected by the European Commission's
Telematics Applications Programme. Competition was very intense as 235
proposals were received in response to the call for proposals which
first appeared in December, 1994.

Mr Jean-Claude Healy, head of the Health Telematics Unit within the
Telecommunications, Information Market and Exploitation of Research
(Directorate-General XIII) told IHN that there was an increase in the
number of proposals received, the number of partners involved and the
quality of the work offered. The amount of money requested was 10 times
the Ecu77 million ($102.8 million) awarded during this first round.
Although the winning proposals were known by the end of July 1995,
negotiations, which always involved reducing budget requests, were not
completed until the end of October.

The Fourth Framework, 1994-1998, research and development (R&D)
programme will provide Ecu12.3 billion for R&D projects in 13 areas of
interest. The telematics area commanded Ecu843 million, of which
approximately Ecu135 million  was for the healthcare sector. Mr Healy
stressed that the Fourth Framework was not an extension of the Third
Framework's Advanced Informatics in Medicine (AIM) programme which ran
from 1991-1994. The new work emphasises users, not technology. Projects
are to identify user needs and to deploy and implement technology to
meet those needs. In addition, this Framework is to support projects
for all Europe, including Eastern countries.
The selected projects fall into the following seven broad categories:

* Multimedia patient records
* Telematics assisted co-operative work for health professionals
* Departmental systems and advanced imaging
* Integration platforms, continuity of care, regional networks
* Telediagnostic, teleconsultation and emergency telemedicine
* Information for citizens and health sector professionals
* Cohesion, dissemination and exploitation of results, education

* For the complete list of projects and the co-ordinator's name,

HEALTH MINISTER OUTLINES POLICY ON IT IN HEALTHCARE

AMSTERDAM - The Dutch minister of health, Dr Else Borst-Eilers, during
the recent AMICE conference, outlined the government's policy on
information technology (IT) in healthcare for the coming years. The
policy has one strategic objective - the integrated electronic patient
record. The objective is not only to have every patient record of a
specific care-giver computerised, but to merge all care related data
concerning one individual.

The Dutch hope to build on the success it has achieved within the
primary healthcare sector, where 80 per cent of general practitioners
(GPs) use automation and 50 per cent use an electronic patient record.
Hospitals and specialists, however, need to improve their use of
information technology. While all hospitals have some computers,
especially in their pharmacies and laboratories, most run legacy
systems that obstruct full integration.

The strategy is not to develop a huge data repository, but rather to
use distributed database technology. Chip cards for both patients and
doctors are to be employed as keys to access data, while enhancing data
protection and privacy. The Dutch IT policy is based on four pillars:

* Integrated electronic care records that use common architecture and
open infrastructures, that will lead to business process redesign and
improved care processes.

* Equip areas with sparse computerisation and educate managers and
health professionals in computer use.

* Assurance of data security, privacy, integrity and reliability, as
well as standards, to promote interconnectivity while enhancing the
responsibilities of trusted users.

* International co-operation and sharing of information technology
methods and tools.

The government believes that improvement in efficiencies will result
from using IT smartly, without reducing current standards of quality.
Many believe that both quality and efficiency can and will increase. It
is expected that hospitals will be seeking to cut costs and will see
integrated computerisation as a means to do so. Hospital administrators
are aware that they must become more efficient in order to survive
reimbursement cuts and price caps on healthcare bills.

The government will provide some research and development money for
work on the integrated patient file and seed money for improving
standards and data protection. In addition, several Dutch projects are
being funded by the European Commission's telematics programme.

DIABCARD TRIAL IN BARCELONA

BARCELONA - A pilot programme to test the viability of a new data card
for diabetics has been initiated at Barcelona's Sant Pau Hospital. Some
100 patients are participating in the programme, one of the first of
its kind in Europe.

The card, called the Diabcard, contains a chip capable of storing
relevant information pertaining to a patient's condition, such as
clinical history, current medications, diet restrictions, etc. The
data's confidentiality is protected by an access code known only to the
patient, a family member and the doctor. Wide use of the card by
diabetics, who number 2.5 million in Spain, would not only benefit
particular patients and hospitals, but also would permit a detailed
study of the demographics of the condition as well as the comparative
costs of treatment.

The pilot test is part of the larger Diabcard project sponsored by the
Telematics Applications programme of the European Commission. Phase I
of the project began in 1992 and it has won continued funding in the
new Fourth Framework. The Diabcard chip card uses an open architecture,
making it easily integrated into existing information systems and
networking environments. The chip can store up to eight kilobytes of
data.

* Information about the Diabcard project can be obtained from the co-
ordinator, Rolf Engelbrecht, GSF-Forschunszentrum, MEDIS-Institut,

INFOMIX - A SUCCESS IN HUNGARIAN HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS

BUDAPEST - Infomix, the software developer company, represents one of
the rare success stories in Hungarian healthcare informatics. The
company started around 1988, as part of the since dissolved Microsystem
Corp, and was among the first to develop a user oriented application
for primary care. In 1995, the company had about 2,800 surgeries as
registered users and sales of over Ft120 million, ($886,132) a 20 per
cent growth from 1994.

Primary care practices in Hungary became equipped with computers,
almost exclusively with DOS based PCs, in the early 1990s. Although
more than 30 per cent of the about 6,000 physicians' offices own some
sort of hardware (mostly outdated 286 or 386 based clones), only a
portion of the doctors use the machines in everyday practice. The
number of those who use computers has been steadily growing as software
became more user friendly and primary care practices became privatised.

Automation in Hungary started in the late 1980s, when all practices
were part of the local government owned and run healthcare service. In
a series of contracts, PC clones were bought and set up in primary care
surgeries. The Ministry of Welfare agreed to pay for developing
software application packages for patient documentation and capitation
based billing for the insurance fund. Although the software was
provided free of charge to primary care physicians, the computer
programmes were of little use. Designed by ministry clerks, without
input and feedback from the physicians, the three programmes developed
were of little use.

At the same time, several profit-oriented software and hardware
companies began to develop application packages that fit end user
needs. More than 10 different programmes were on the market in the
early 1990s. A real market situation resulted, with different companies
offering systems that varied from dBase applications to sophisticated
Windows based programmes. The successful systems offered maintenance
and support services with their software.

Infomix was among the early successful companies. The first version of
its user friendly software was launched in 1988 and was bought by 65
surgeries, each with multiple users. (In Hungary, it is typical that
general practitioners share their surgeries, working in multiple
shifts). An updated version was offered in 1990 and by 1993, the number
of running applications grew to 890. The 2,800 licensed users in 1995
are served by a central developer and a maintenance group of full-time
employees. Infomix has four regional centres in Hungary and a 22-unit
dealer web that helps with distribution.

The company has followed its success in primary care with the
development of applications for polyclinics where 80 sites are equipped
and for dental surgeries with 150 users. Infomix has developed a few
hospital applications and is presently working on software for
occupational health specialists and other providers. The hospital
market is one in which the company expects keen competition, as that is
expected to represent the next phase of computerisation within the
health sector.

ALBERTA TESTS SMART CARD

VANCOUVER - A panel of doctors, health administrators and government
officials is completing work on a pilot project to provide "smart"
medical record cards to residents of one of the Alberta's 17 healthcare
regions some time this spring.

The card would provide healthcare professionals instant access to a
patient's medical history. "I feel [the project] is absolutely critical
from a business perspective," said Denis Herard, chairman of the Health
Information Network Committee, as the panel is known.

If adopted province-wide, Herard says, the card could cut 5 per cent
from the province's C$3.5 billion ($2.5 billion) a year of healthcare
charges. Duplication of expensive tests would be minimised, and use of
multiple prescriptions for the same illness prevented.

However, Herard admits the card poses some problems, especially in
protection of patient privacy. "Do you want to have 2.5 million health
histories walking around the province in wallets and purses?" he asked.
Herard favours a pass-key type of card, which would allow healthcare
professionals to access patient records in a central computer system.

However, some members of the panel prefer a card with the patient
records directly encoded on it. Brian Edy, director of the Alberta
Civil Liberties Association says safeguards must be imposed in areas
such as histories of Aids tests and psychiatric treatment, to prevent
abuse of the system. The government says the use of "firewall"
technology can prevent unauthorised personnel from accessing such
sensitive information. The pilot project has already been approved by
the provincial health department.

NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE MAKES PROFIT FROM PRIVATE PATIENTS

LONDON - Britain's publicly-funded National Health Service (NHS) is
making a healthy profit from treating private patients, a study by a
firm of consultants has found. The study Are Pay-Beds Profitable? by
National Economic Research Associates, found that the NHS was making a
profit of around #290 ($460) for each private patient treated. The
authors noted that even if hidden costs, such as the cost of training
doctors and nurses and unplanned admissions to intensive care were
taken into account, the hospitals would still make a profit of at least
#235 per patient.

National Economic Research Associates surveyed six NHS hospitals, which
together account for more than 10 per cent of dedicated private patient
beds in the NHS. The issue of whether the NHS makes money from private
patients has long been a controversial one, with the owners of
independent hospitals arguing that NHS hospitals are competing unfairly
by using NHS funds to subsidise private patient care. The authors of
the report said that because NHS hospitals now had a 14 per cent share
of the private patient market, it was important to find out whether or
not their private patients were helping to reduce funding problems in
the NHS.

David Cavers, the managing director of medical insurers Norwich
Healthcare, commented that the NHS was beginning to represent real
competition for private operators. "[Pay-beds at NHS Trust hospitals]
are generally competitively priced so that from an insured customer's
point of view, the premium saving which this can represent can be very
significant."

UK ANNOUNCES SPENDING ON HEALTH

LONDON - The government has announced that current spending on health
in England will rise #1.3 billion to #31.49 billion ($50 billion) in
the 1996-1997 year. The increase amounts to 1.6 per cent, or #500
million in real terms. Current spending on hospital and community
health services is to rise by 1.1 per cent in real terms, to #23.18
billion.

The Secretary of State for Health, Stephen Dorrell, said four areas
would receive priority allocations next year: primary care, research
and development, education and training, and mental health services.
Primary care allocations will increase by #9 million or 1.25 per cent
to support spending by family doctors on practice staff and computing
costs. In addition, almost #39 million will go to support the provision
of out-of-hours services by general practitioners. Mr Dorrell said
spending on family health services as a whole will increase by 3.9 per
cent in real terms.

                  Current NHS spending: England
                          (# million)

30,151              31,491        32,396      33,251

Funding for research and development will increase by #27 million, to
#436 million, to ensure that better healthcare solutions will be
"widely disseminated and implemented". Support for education and
training in the National Health Services (NHS) will rise by #68
million, to #1,767 million. Mr Dorrell said that a new "mental health
fund" had also been set up to meet urgent priorities in the development
of mental health services.

The government has told health authorities that they must make
efficiency savings of three per cent, equivalent to #650 million, in
the 1996-1997 year. Mr Dorrell said this target includes planned
savings of #130 million on management and administration costs at NHS
trusts and health authorities.

STUDY SHOWS UK HOSPITAL INTENSIVE CARE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

LONDON - Britain must put more resources into improving standards of
intensive care, according to David Bennett, author of a study on ICU
services in the South West Thames Regional Health Authority. Bennett, a
reader in intensive care medicine at St George's Hospital Medical
School in London, looked at the outcomes for more than 10,000 patients
who were admitted to intensive care beds in the region.

Dr Bennett claims that the state of intensive care in the UK compares
unfavourably to other European countries and the US. He says that an
average of only one to two per cent of beds in Britain were for
patients in intensive care, compared to between four and six per cent
of beds in most other western countries. The UK spends only #5.90
($9.3) per head of population on intensive care compared to #54 ($85)
per capita spent by France.

Higher mortality rates

The two year study, Bennett says, showed that patients admitted to
intensive care beds in the UK had higher mortality rates than those in
the US.
The US spends an estimated #144 per head of population on intensive
care. Dr Bennett comments: "If you go to hospitals in the United
States, it's very obvious [that they spend more]. The facilities are
better and there are more of them. You don't have to do a scientific
study to come to that conclusion."

Bennett claims that even if the NHS were to increase the number of beds
available for seriously ill patients, there would still be too few
staff with the training to care for them. He argues that a properly
organised training programme and a formal career structure for
intensivists must be developed in order to encourage more doctors into
the speciality.

Not all seriously ill patients require intensive care, and Bennett
proposes an intermediate level hospital unit. He believes that National
Health Service hospitals should introduce high dependency units for
patients who require more care than they would receive in a general
ward, but less than that provided in intensive care. "We know that
we're looking after a substantial number of patients in intensive care
who could be looked after somewhere else; if somewhere else existed."

IRELAND TO PROMOTE EXPORT SALES

DUBLIN - Pharmaceuticals and healthcare are among the 10 sectors slated
for growth by the new programme, "Opportunity Europe". Export sales
from Irish companies to Europe are expected to increase 17 per cent to
#1.45 billion ($230.2 billion) in 1996. If Irish companies take
advantage of the programme, Board Trachtala believes that Irish exports
could reach #3.2 billion in Europe by the year 2001.

Enda Kenny, minister for tourism and trade, said that Irish companies
have turned in an excellent performance on European markets in 1995,
#1.25 billion, up 17 percent from 1994. "With continued growth forecast
in all major European economies in 1996, Board Trachtala will be
spending a record #10 million, its biggest ever promotional campaign in
European markets to assist Irish companies to win more business," said
Mr Kenny.

The Opportunity Europe programme includes: providing financial
incentives for Irish companies to establish European sales offices;
undertaking business lead projects to identify new business areas;
sponsoring more than 40 trade and study missions and sales-support
programmes; flying 600 key European buyers to Ireland; and holding
about 29 regional seminars and workshops in Ireland to brief companies
on the European potential.

FRENCH HOSPITAL REFORM REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED

PARIS - The French government's plans for reforming the healthcare
system have not yet fallen victim either to the social unrest that
swept the country in late November and early December or to the
opposition of certain elements of the medical profession. While the
government was forced to back down on a number of its proposals for
curtailing the privileges and fringe benefits enjoyed by many public
sector employees, prime minister Alain Juppe is pressing ahead to
reform the administration and financing of the social security system
in general and the health system in particular.

Hospital reform is currently receiving attention. To advise the
government on the best ways and means of streamlining the hospital
sector, an ad hoc Hospital Reform Commission was set up in June, which
submitted an interim report in September and its final report at the
end of November. The Commission proposals revolve around four main
principles: regionalisation of public supervision and funding of
hospitals; evaluation of hospital services (to maintain the most
efficient and eliminate the least cost-effective); setting of
objectives embodied in contracts negotiated between regional agencies
and individual establishments; and more effective co-ordination between
public and private hospitals.

A specific criticism of the proposals as presently conceived is that
they neither address the problems of the imbalance in funding among
hospitals nor the regional variations in both funding and the provision
of services. The oversupply of hospital facilities might be curtailed
to some extent by the elimination of the least efficient services, but
there are no specific measures for eliminating inefficiencies, such as
overstaffing or excessive hospital stays.

The fact is that some hospitals perform the same services as others
with only one-quarter or one-third the number of staff, or keep
patients in hospital after operations only half the time that others do
without any loss of quality.

While most doctors' and healthcare professionals' unions support these
proposed reforms, other organisations are violently opposed to them.
Moreover, it is clear that the government has no intention of simply
accepting all the Commission's recommendations; instead, it is treating
its report essentially as a discussion document.

Past mistakes

Ministers have apparently learned from past mistakes and are now
seeking to secure a consensus amongst hospital doctors and staff for an
agreed programme of reform, aware that it will only work if it has the
support and co-operation of those who will have to put it into
practice. Herve Gaymard, the health minister, started negotiating with
representatives of hospital doctors and staff in December, intimating
from the outset that some of the Commission's proposals would not be
implemented, although it is not clear which changes the government
thinks essential and which it regards as negotiable.

This softening of the government's position was greeted with some
satisfaction by hospital doctors' organisations, which think the
introduction of a system of evaluation and certification of hospital
services will result in the break-up of establishments. They have
called on the government to reject the Commission's proposals and
abandon plans for hospital reform altogether.

Hospital doctors are not the only critics of reform; other hospital
staff are also concerned, since there could be adverse consequences on
employment as a result of the closure of some services and
establishments.

FRANCE SUPPORTS AIDS CAMPAIGN

PARIS - The French government will be spending well over FFr5 billion
($982.3 million) on fighting Aids in 1996, of which hospital care for
Aids patients will absorb some FFr4.2 billion. State spending on
research will top FFr500 million for the first time this year, while
FFr448 million has been allocated to a nation-wide Aids prevention and
support programme (up from FFr386 million in 1995).

Prevention remains the overriding priority of the government and will
absorb FFr264.2 million (59 per cent) of its FFr448-million campaign
budget this year, 14.5 per cent more than in 1995. The other components
of the government programme are providing home care support (FFr38.4
million), reducing risks for drug addicts (FFr50 million) and expanding
the network of free and anonymous HIV testing centres (FFr20.6
million). Nearly half of public funding for Aids research in 1996
(FFr231 million) is earmarked for the National Aids Research Agency,
while the rest will go to a variety of public and private
establishments.

The cost of hospital care for HIV-infected people amounted to FFr3.93
billion in 1995 and is expected to amount to FFr4.2 billion in 1996.
That sum includes direct credits advanced to hospitals to finance the
installation and operation of special facilities, services and
medicines for Aids patients. The government had allocated total credits
of just over FFr3 billion in 1995. A further FFr240 million is being
made available in 1996 specifically to pay for biological testing of
the "viral load" of Aids patients, which helps doctors track and
predict the development of the HIV virus.

An estimated 28,000-30,000 people have died of Aids in France to date,
and there are currently some 16,000-17,500 people suffering from the
disease. Altogether, 110,000 people are believed to be HIV-positive in
France, of which around 63,500 receive some form of medical care,
55,000 of them as in-patients or out-patients of hospitals and clinics.

FRANCE INCREASES PACE OF CHANGE

PARIS - Having survived the wave of strikes in December, French prime
minister Alain Juppe is forcing the pace of legislation to bring health
and social spending into line.

His government has already drafted the first two orders designed to
control costs and boost revenues for the system. These were sent to
interested parties - such as medical unions and state health and social
security funds - with only a few days to submit comments before an 8
January deadline. The orders will be submitted to the president and are
expected to be approved by the Cabinet on the 17th or the 24th January.
The legislation will be backdated to 1 January.

One of the orders is designed to turn the social security regime around
from a deficit of FFr64.5 billion ($12.9 billion) in 1994 to a surplus
of FFr11.7 billion ($2.34 billion) by 1997. Family allowances will be
frozen. In addition, doctors' fees in 1996 and 1997 will be set under a
general regime negotiated by the doctors' unions and the health funds.
Such actions are expected to save as much as FFr1 billion.

At the same time, a decree published on 21 December has abolished some
of the privileges of the doctors operating in "sector 1" (where fees
are set). Until now a part of their social security contributions were
borne by the system. Making the physicians pay more should raise some
FFr500 million.

Opposition

These measures naturally face the opposition of the doctor's unions,
although a significant number of doctors do not want to take on the
government over its reforms. Social affairs minister Jacques Barrot met
with the leaders of the four largest doctors' associations last week to
discuss spending limits and reimbursement issues, hoping to reach a
consensus.

Mr Juppe's target for this year is to let health spending for private
medical practices, outside hospitals, rise by 2.1 per cent. But since
the spending last year rose by 7 per cent, instead of the agreed upon
3.3 per cent, this year's increase starts from a fairly high base.

Mr Juppe's plan also envisages making the pharmaceutical industry pay
FFr2.5 billion to the social security system. Quite how this might be
done has not been settled yet, but it is probable that companies will
pay on three counts. Firstly, the tax on their promotion expenses will
rise to 14 per cent from 9 per cent. Secondly, there will be a charge
based on the increase in sales in France; this will take into account
those companies that contained their costs. Finally, there will be a
charge of up to 1.5 per cent of turnover. Smallest companies may be
relieved of payment requirements.

The second government order concerns the new tax RDS (Remboursement de
la dette sociale), which is to be levied at a rate of 0.5 per cent on
all income, including most savings income and capital gains. It is
estimated that this tax will raise FFr25 billion a year. It is intended
to raise the revenue needed to erase France's social security deficit.

EUROPEAN HEALTH MINISTERS SIGNAL TOUGHER ACTION ON ALCOHOL

PARIS - Health ministers from 50 European countries have signalled
tougher action against the drinks industry by adopting a new European
Charter on Alcohol. The Charter, adopted at a ministerial conference
organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Paris in mid-
December, is not mandatory on governments, and it remains to be seen
what many of them will do to implement it. But there is no doubt it
will put the alcohol industry under further pressure and will place
more stringent restrictions in Europe's market.

The document calls on WHO's European member states to draw up
comprehensive alcohol policies and to implement programmes such as
influencing price through taxation, controlling advertising and
stopping all ads aimed at young people.

The alcohol industry was furious at the way the conference was handled,
claiming it was deliberately stage managed in favour of groups calling
for new anti-alcohol measures. Only the Amsterdam Group, a coalition of
leading European drinks producers, was allowed to attend, as observers.
Requests from other industry organisations to sit in were flatly
rejected by WHO.

A WHO official, Claes Goos, strongly denied that either WHO or the
Charter were "neo-prohibitionist" and that WHO was aiming for the
"complete elimination of alcohol" in Europe. WHO officials believe that
the Charter will give a significant political boost to the European
Alcohol Action Plan, approved in 1992, which aims to achieve a 25 per
cent cut in alcohol consumption across Europe between 1980 and the year
2000.

There were signs at the conference that some governments are unlikely
to act quickly, despite endorsing the Charter. Mr John Bowis, the UK
Under-Secretary for Health said: "for most people, some [drink] is
better than none". He was heckled by delegates when he also said: "If
you pretend that alcohol is bad, people won't accept the message of
moderate drinking". The Italian and German representatives also voiced
concern over parts of the Charter.

GERMANY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ON TRACKING DOCTORS' PRESCRIPTIONS

FRANKFURT - Although pharmacists were given until the new year to
report medications and dosages ordered by individual physicians, they
were doing so by the end of October, according to Dr Otfried P
Schaefer, Hessen Physicians Association (Kassenaerztliche vereinigung).


These reports go to the insurance funds where each doctor's prescribing
pattern is examined in relationship to those with similar specialties.
If it is believed that a physician is over-prescribing, then the state
physicians association is alerted. The associations send warnings to
those doctors who are ordering over 25 per cent more than their
colleagues. If corrective action is not taken, the doctor will have to
pay for the excess drugs ordered.

The smart cards that have been given to all Germans covered by
statutory insurance funds and the readers given to all physicians have
facilitated the reporting requirement. Moreover, pharmacists are given
a small stipend for each bill sent (less than 1 cent). Private
insurance companies will also distribute smart cards to their customers
during 1996.

The statutory insurance companies paid a total of DM410 million ($282
million) for developing the smart card project, issuing 72 million
insurance memory chip cards to the insured and granting 160,000 doctors
and dentists money to purchase card readers. The government expects
that these new cards and the requirement that physician associations
bill the insurance companies electronically will save DM2-3 billion a
year. However, Dr Schaefer claims that he is not aware of any cost-
benefit analysis that has taken place.

The smart card project is also credited with encouraging doctors to
computerise their offices. At the end of September 1995, over 60 per
cent of all doctors in Germany were using computers for administrative
work and for medical documentation. In some regions, close to 80 per
cent of doctors have computers. The use of computers is expected to
accelerate, as next month doctors will be required to place ICD-10
diagnostic codes on all bills.

Physicians are aware that such information will permit reviews of their
treatment and prescribing patterns. While they are not pleased by this
prospect, they are further angered that they are expected to foot the
entire bill so that such data are provided. Dr Schaefer told IHN that
over DM700 million for computerisation has been absorbed by the doctors
and another DM700 million will be spent before everyone is on-line.

Efforts are being made to ensure that there is interoperability between
computers and the software doctors use. However, Dr Schaefer notes that
the physicians have not been offered discounts or government allowances
to encourage them to follow the standards that have been worked about
by the insurance companies and the physicians associations. Rather, the
doctors are being told the standards that they must follow in billing
and reporting and compliance is expected.

TRANSPLANT LAW FOR GERMANY AT LAST?

BONN -- There is a good chance that in 1996 Germany will finally have a
law dealing with organ transplants. The health ministry has prepared a
proposal that is supported by the Christian Democrat/Liberal majority,
as well as most members of the Social Democrat opposition. The German
states have also been involved and are expected to give their consent
to the proposed law.

Germany is one of the few countries in Europe without a transplant law.
Some 15 years ago, an unsuccessful attempt was made to introduce an
"opting out" bill, which implied that everyone is an organ donor unless
he/she specifically refuses to be one. Thereafter, the transplant
community derived a strict code of rules that included an "opting in"
solution. The wishes of the deceased were to be followed, or if not
apparent (for example, by a donor card), decisions by relatives.

Passionate public discussion

Although the proposed law follows current practise, it has stirred up
passionate public discussion and a great deal of media attention,
especially about brain death as a secure sign of death. A group of
theologists and doctors claim that brain dead patients are not dead,
but are dying. They feel that the process of dying must not be
disturbed by organ procurement, unless the dead person himself had
given consent to organ donation after brain death. Relatives should not
be able to give consent by proxy.

The Green Party has proposed a law that contains this argument. At a
public hearing last summer in Bonn, however, transplant surgeons made
it clear that transplantation would be entirely given up, unless brain
death was legally acknowledged as death.

Currently there are about 2,000 kidney transplants performed per year
in Germany, with 9,000 patients on the waiting list. About 500 livers
and 500 hearts are transplanted each year, but twice as many are needed
to help all waiting patients. For the past 26 years, Germany has
exchanged organs via Eurotransplant in Leiden (Netherlands) with
Austria, Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg.

It was hoped that a transplant law would provide legal security to
those involved in organ donation and serve to promote organ
transplantation. So far the proposed legislation has proven to be
counterproductive. Public discussion and the apprehensive attitudes of
doctors and nurses have contributed to a decline in the number of organ
donations in 1994. Figures for 1995 are to be published soon and are
expected to be slightly higher.

In January, the transplant law will be introduced into the Bonn
parliament, where further hearings and discussion will be held. It has
been agreed that party discipline will not be maintained and that each
member can follow his/her own conscience in respect to the critical
points of brain death and consent by proxy.

ITALY DRASTICALLY CUTS 1996 SPENDING FOR PHARMACEUTICALS

ROME - In a surprise and hotly contested move, the Italian parliament
has passed a law forcing further drastic reductions in state spending
on medicines for 1996. Parliament, while debating the government's 1996
Finance Bill (IHN 6,November 1995, page 1) attached a late amendment
stipulating that, although the government will continue to reimburse
the full cost of medication for life-threatening and chronic illness
through the so-called Class A Medicines and one-half for lesser
ailments (Class B). The payment for both categories will be based on
the most economic medicine available for cures.

Until now, reimbursement covered the varying prices of medicines and
was not pegged to the cheapest drug. The new law also stipulates that
doctors prescribing medicines in the two categories are to inform
patients that government reimbursement will be equivalent to the price
of the most economic medication.

The parliament acted a few days after the Italian government wrote off
the cost overrun of L700 billion ($43.1 million) for subsidised
medicine in 1995. The Finance Bill for 1995 had set a ceiling of L9,000
billion for subsidised medicine, but it was apparent within months that
the cap could not be maintained for the year. The government's self-
imposed limit was also breached in 1994. Despite these overruns, and no
expectation that costs for medicines will be reduced, the government
has retained the L9,000 ceiling for 1996.

Italy's slumping pharmaceutical industry registered a wave of protests.
It claims that all Class A and B medicines that cost more than the
cheapest ones will be forced into Class C, which does not receive any
governmental reimbursement. This may render the drugs no longer
marketable.

Italy's pharmaceutical industry association, Farmindustria, threatened
to pull out of the National Health Service, without specifying how, or
if, it could be achieved.

In a minor compensation, prices of Class A and B medicines are expected
to increase between 2.6 and 5 per cent in 1996. It is also expected
that Class C drugs, which are unregulated by the government, will have
similar increases. The rise will be less than the rate of inflation,
which is around 6 per cent annually.

ITALIANS CONSULT TRAVEL AGENTS FIRST WHEN TAKEN ILL

ROME - Increasing numbers of Italians are going abroad, particularly to
neighbouring France, for healthcare services. Unavailability of some
services and perceptions that health services abroad are superior are
reasons given by the estimated thousands who are called "health
refugees" or "health migrants". The numbers give validity to claims
that when some Italians fall seriously ill, they consult not only their
doctors but also their travel agents.

In 1993, the latest official Ministry of Health figures indicate that
the National Health Service (NHS) owed L216 billion ($133 million) to
its EU partners for services rendered to Italian citizens abroad. This
included L204 billion to France, L10 billion to Belgium and L1.2
billion to the UK. The amount for care abroad, however, has ballooned
since then. For example, the 1994 amount has been estimated as L481
billion.

A Ministry of Health study, based on 7,000 authorisations issued
between 1990 and 1993, indicates that some 2,300 persons went abroad
for cancer treatment, 1,500 for transplants, close to 1,000 for
neurological care (including surgery) and 800 for treatments of heart
diseases. The exact number of "health migrants" is not known, but it is
believed to be in the tens of thousands a year, including those who by-
pass the NHS and bear the entire cost.

The consensus is that the "health migrants" are forced to leave Italy
because waiting lists are too long, as adequate services are lacking.
Scarcity of transplant organs is identified as a major problem in
Italy; of some 3,500 needs a year, availability is put at 1,300. In
addition, cardiac by-pass surgery waiting lists are from six to eight
months in Milan, Rome and Naples.

AUSTRIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OFFERS REFORM PROPOSALS

VIENNA - the Austrian Medical Association (Arztekammer) has issued a
report that passes a devastating judgement on the country's healthcare
programme. The healthcare system is characterised by an overblown
bureaucracy and expensive care, both of which are responsible for the
system's financial crisis.

The association argues that more out-patient care is needed along with
reform of hospital financing. The healthcare programme should only
apply to basic medical care, although persons with high, long-term and
social problems should not be excluded from care. A cap related to
income should be applied and those who earn more than the cap should be
able to choose among health insurers.

Patients, except for the needy, should pay 20 per cent of their
healthcare costs. High risk activities such as those associated with
sports and leisure activities should be insured separately. In general,
local medical care, rather than major healthcare centres, should be
encouraged.

Additionally, the association views healthcare facility administration
as a major problem in need of resolution. For example, Vienna's vast
general hospital (AKH) is operated by both the federal and city
governments instead of having its own administration.

"We doctors have no control, we're not, as the public thinks, the
captains, not even the first officers of the medical flagship AKH. We
don't have the possibility to control the AKH", argues one university
professor.

WHO CASH CRISIS DEEPENS

GENEVA - Some World Health Organisation (WHO) programmes are likely to
be transferred from Geneva and more job losses are expected, as the
organisation's cash crisis looks set to worsen this year.

Between 140-150 posts at headquarters were eliminated in 1995 because
of a $54 million shortfall in WHO's two year $842 million regular
budget. Another 50 posts are expected to be cut during 1996, and it is
rumoured that a provisional "hit list" of posts to go has been drawn up
already.

WHO's budget, suffering badly because of problems in getting the US to
pay its contributions, faces further uncertainty and possibly serious
body blows. There are doubts, for example, about whether Russia and
Ukraine, two other big contributors, will pay anything this year.

As well as cutting more posts, WHO officials have also launched an
urgent study into relocating programmes or parts of programmes out of
headquarters to places with a lower cost of living. The effect of this
would be to change WHO radically - into a network, with just a small
kernel of people remaining in Geneva mainly to interact with other UN
agencies.

A full report on WHO's cash crisis will be given to its executive board
this month. Director-general Dr Hiroshi Nakajima is expected to call
for a rethink in the way countries' contributions to WHO are assessed.
At present, 20 contributors provide 80 per cent of its budget. He is
also likely to say that WHO must find new, long-term solutions for
supporting its programmes, including developing new partnerships with
the private sector.

Meanwhile, morale remains low at WHO headquarters, where staff have
been bitterly critical of Dr Nakajima's handling of the crisis.

UNAIDS STARTS UP AMID DOUBTS

GENEVA - The international community's latest effort to get to grips
with the global Aids epidemic, UNAids, started up on 1 January amid
doubts about its likely effectiveness or real value. UNAids is a joint
venture among six United Nation (UN) agencies: the World Health
Organisation (WHO); the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organisation; the UN Children's Fund; the UN Development Programme; the
UN Population Fund; and the World Bank.

Located in Geneva, UNAids replaces WHO's Global Programme on Aids
(GPA), which attracted wide criticism for being over-staffed, wasting
resources and achieving few concrete results. While UNAids will have a
much smaller staff than GPA and most of them will be working outside
Geneva, it will cover essentially the same ground: identifying `best
practice' policies for prevention and care, providing technical support
to national governments, advocacy and co-ordination. It will also have
roughly the same budget as GPA, between $120-$140 million a year.

UNAids will give about 50 per cent less funds to national Aids
programmes than GPA, however. Governments are supposed to make up the
difference, but this is thought doubtful.

Although Dr Peter Piot was appointed the programme's executive director
in December 1994, staff have not yet been recruited. GPA staff, due to
lose their jobs with its shut down, have been switched temporarily to
the UNAid's payroll. There is concern about relations between UNAids
and WHO, which is keeping a Division on Aids and Sexually Transmitted
Diseases.

Sceptics also question whether the new programme is really needed,
especially in light of WHO's alleged failures. They point out that Dr
Piot has admitted that "there is an agenda here of UN reform that's
also behind this programme. We will show that it is possible in the UN
with a lean operation to be efficient and effective". Critics claim
that UNAids is an exercise in trying to show the UN in a better light.

Supporters, however, argue that the UN and its agencies cannot wash
their hands of the Aids problem. They say that UNAids will bring some
urgently needed streamlining and co-ordination of the UN's activities
and will do so with fewer staff and more cost effectiveness.

SPAIN FINDS 1996 FULL OF HEALTH SYSTEM PROBLEMS

MADRID - As 1996 begins, Spain's public health sector is faced with a
host of woes, including debt, fraud, internal dissension and the still
unresolved problems resulting from the two-month long physician's
strike.

Problems include:

* Hospitals throughout the country are up to two years behind in
payments to various companies which supply them with goods and
services. The suppliers have threatened on numerous occasions to halt
deliveries and suspend services if the situation doesn't improve. The
service supplier's association FENIN claims that the late payments are
a serious problem, especially for smaller suppliers, and has proposed 1
February as the new deadline for the threatened stoppage of supply
delivery. The association also has plans to denounce the situation
before the European Community.

* The ministry of health has made public its concern at the steep rise
over the last 10 years of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness.
Workplace illness has tripled costs for the public health sector. In
1995, it cost the government Pta466 billion ($3.72 billion) to pay for
temporary incapacities, up from Pta376 billion five years ago. The
ministry attributes much of this increase to insufficient control of
diagnoses by physicians, a charge strongly denied by the profession.

* Spain's 4,500 substitute doctors, temporarily employed by the
country's health system but without fixed contracts, are beginning to
protest against layoffs among their ranks due to the return to duty of
contracted physicians who have been on long-term sabbaticals. Several
hundred of Madrid's 1,300 substitute doctors, many who have worked for
years without a contract, have begun small-scale protests at the
layoffs at several of the city's hospitals, and the national body which
represents them is in the process of deciding whether to support them
with widespread actions. The state health agency, Insalud,
characterised the substitute physicians fears as exaggerated.

* Still pending in negotiations between Insalud and the physicians
union after an accord was reached to end last spring's strike are
agreements on many important topics, among them: the amount of pay
increases for 1997 and following years (salaries for 1996 had been
agreed on in the original negotiations); the increased role of doctors
in hospital management reform; the situation of substitute physicians;
and new standards for university medical degrees.

NORWEGIAN DOCTORS FAVOUR PRIVATISATION

OSLO - Den norske Laegeforening (DnL) has formed a special working
group to promote the representative organisation's case for the phased-
privatisation of out-patients centres attached to Norway's state run
hospitals and clinics.

"Our case is that under a privatised structure, these out-patient
centres could achieve a higher level of product and give a better all-
round service. As it stands, they are poorly managed with low
efficiency rates. Privatisation is essential if they are to reach their
full potential," said DnL's chairman Hans Petter Aarseth. At issue are
over 200 out-patient centres which generated annual revenues of $317
million in 1994 and are forecast to show a 4 per cent rise in turnover,
adjusted for inflation, in 1995.

"Privatisation would have the added-effect of improving working
conditions, reducing work-loads for doctors and nurses, while paving
the way for better wages for medical personnel. Under the plan we are
advocating, doctors would work one to two days every week at out-
patient centres, taking care of their own patients," said Mr Aarseth.

"These centres must move with the times. Why should qualified doctors
who has gone through eight years of medical training want to work for a
basic annual salary of $29,000, when they could earn three times as
much in private healthcare," said Mr Aarseth. Medical staff assigned to
the out-patient centres are, according to Mr Aarseth, "battle weary",
and are fully behind the DnL's drive to lobby government action on the
privatisation issue. "Doctors are tired of struggling through outdated
systems, while younger doctors and specialists do not want to work for
state-operated medical centres. Along with this we have lengthening
queues of increasingly exasperated patients," he said.

The DnL recently published a highly critical report detailing the low
performance levels at state-managed out-patients centres. The report
found that centres were "too bureaucratic", under-staffed and run in a
disorganised fashion". The report concludes that state-run hospitals
are not designed or equipped to operate out-patients centres. "This is
a conclusion we reach every day. These institutions are simply too big
and bureaucratic," said Mr Aarseth.

"A patient attending a state out-patient centre for a check-up in
Norway is not met by a doctor, but by a huge bureaucracy, in which he
or she will see a doctor unfamiliar with their case or condition.
Records are often missing, and time is wasted as the relevant files are
located. This is not something that happens only on rare occasions. It
is a routine event at state-managed centres," said Mr Aarseth.

FDA FLOODED WITH RESPONSES TO PROPOSED CIGARETTE RULING

ROCKVILLE, MD - The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Dockets
Management Branch was a site to behold on 2 January 1995, the last day
for comments on FDA's proposed rule to restrict minors' exposure and
access to tobacco advertisements and products. The branch had received
59,992 comments on the proposed rule that appeared in the Federal
Register, 11 August 1995.

"We have filled three aisles and 3,688 files with the comments, not
including the 32 cartons of comments received from tobacco companies
and their attorneys," a manager of the branch told IHN. "The total
tally will be far more than 60,000 comments and 4,000 files, as we
haven't received many documents that were postmarked 2 January," she
continued. "I have been here over 20 years and this is the most that I
have ever seen."

The proposed rule and its supporting documents fill a folder. Studies
have been reproduced with lengthy footnotes to support the action
proposed by the FDA. The administration asserts that cigarettes are a
drug delivery device and therefore is subject to the jurisdiction of
the FDA. The rule claims that tobacco companies should be required to
fund $150 million per year in advertising campaigns that warn children
of the health dangers of smoking.

Various restrictions are proposed on tobacco company advertising that
is accessible to minors. Additionally it proposes to ban cigarette
sales from vending machines. The FDA estimates that the cost of the
rule to tobacco manufacturers will be $230 million annually over 15
years, while the benefits are estimated to be between $2.9 billion to
$4.3 billion, primarily in lives saved.

Responses to the proposed rule were received from a variety of people.
School children and groups opposed to cigarette smoking sent pages of
comments. Form letters were received from owners of grocery stores,
provided by the Retail Grocers Association, and from people who
attended health fairs. Civil libertarians opposed another area of
government infringement of personal rights, and state legislators,
especially from tobacco growing areas, were aghast at federal power
enhancement. In addition, 32 US senators wrote urging the FDA to
abandon the proposal.

The cigarette industry waited until the last day of comment to deliver
its response. Five companies and the Tobacco Institute, assisted by
major law firms, prepared a joint response to the ruling. In addition,
they have challenged the ruling in court, claiming that the FDA has
exceeded its legal authority in proposing to regulate cigarettes. The
industry asserts that neither the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act nor the
1976 medical device amendments grant FDA statutory authority to
regulate cigarettes.

The Philip Morris Company's Philip Morris US unit, BAT Industries PLC's
Brown & Williamson unit, Brooke Group Ltd's Ligget Group unit, RJR
Nabisco Holdings Corporation's RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company unit and
Loews Corporation's Lorillard Tobacco Company unit assert that nicotine
does not fit the legal definition of a drug and its effects do not fit
the legal definition of addiction. Moreover, they claim that the FDA
based its rule on secret documents and confidential industry papers.
The tobacco companies were assisted in preparing their response of 12
volumes of 2,000 pages and appendices of 40,000 pages by lawyers from
such prestigious firms as Arnold & Porter, Wiley, Rein & Fielding,
Covington & Burling and others.

The industry's estimated costs of the ruling differs significantly from
that of the FDA. It claims that the rule will cost manufacturers
between $748 million to $1.5 billion in one-time costs and $1.25
billion annually.

MEDICAL MALPRACTICE AWARDS RISE

WASHINGTON, DC - Jury Verdict Research, Inc reports that the US median
medical malpractice jury award in 1995 was $500,000, some 40 per cent
higher than 1994. The number of $1 million awards increased to 35 per
cent of the verdicts. Responses from other groups indicate that 70 per
cent of malpractice claims filed against doctors do not result in
payment. Those that go to trial, however, result in 80 per cent decided
in favour of the defendant.

ALBERTA WILL NOT CUT DOCTOR FEES

VANCOUVER - The province of Alberta has dropped its demand for a C$50
million cut in doctors' healthcare billings. In its final meeting
before Christmas, the cabinet agreed to freeze doctors' fees at current
levels for the next three years. The province presently pays doctors
C$736.7 million ($533.8 million) annually.

The decision ends nine months of wrangling between the government and
the Alberta Medical Association. Ontario, however, appears headed for a
similar clash with the healthcare givers. Its controversial omnibus
Bill 26 would give the minister of health unilateral power to fund,
shut or merge hospitals, as part of an arsenal of budget-tightening
measures.

As well, the Bill would set up a provincial agency to inspect medical
and billing practices. It could terminate a doctor's right to practice,
bypassing the Ontario Medical Association. So far the Bill is still
wielding its bumpy way through the legislature, with stiff opposition
from all affected groups.

MEXICO PLANS TO EXTEND HEALTHCARE

MEXICO CITY - Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, unveiled plans to
provide healthcare services to remote areas and to expand service to
the country's poor. The stabilised economy and expected 1996 growth
will free resources to support the healthcare plan, claimed Zedillo.

"This package will be an essential component of the strategy with which
we propose to widen the coverage of health services to the most distant
parts of the country, to those places which until now have not had
these essential services," Zedillo said in a speech to Mexican nurses.
The government plans to implement a 12 point plan that will have
doctors and other health providers man health brigades and mobile
health units.

Additionally, the government plans to improve health services to the
needy. These efforts will include: expanding vaccination programmes;
increasing access to family planning methods; improving basic home
hygiene, monitoring child nutrition; increasing care to pregnant women;
and enhancing prevention and treatment of illnesses associated with
poverty.

JAPANESE GROUP TO FIGHT MALPRACTICE

TOKYO - A new group, Society for the Study of Medical Safety, was
founded in Japan on 9 December 1995. Its aim is to identify dangerous
medical practices, learn from Western medical systems and exchange
information through seminars. The group's founders include lawyers,
medical professionals and citizen groups.

"Through these activities, we hope in the near future to draw up
guidelines and make suggestions to medical circles on how medical
workers can avoid accidents", the Society's founder, lawyer Yoshio
Kato, stated in an interview with a leading daily, The Japan Times.

Plaintiffs win only about one-third of the 400 to 500 malpractice suits
filed in Japan each year, and Kato blames these low figures on the lack
of transparency of Japan's medical system. "Under the legal system,
patients or their families who have almost no access to medical
information are obliged to prove malpractice that often occurs behind
the closed doors of operating rooms." This task is exacerbated by a
tendency among healthcare workers to cover up malpractice, he added.

JAPAN PROPOSES TO REDUCE PHARMACEUTICAL SPENDING

TOKYO - The Japanese government continues to look for ways to control
drug spending, as it prepares for its biennial evaluation and
reconstruction of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Drug Price List.
The Central Social Insurance Medical Council (CSIMC), responsible for
making recommendations to the government on healthcare prices, has met
and made proposals for establishing the next drug price list, scheduled
to be published in April, 1996.

In Japan, ethical drugs are reimbursed according to the NHI Drug Price
List. The prices of drugs are calculated on a weighted average method.
A price is set by adding a given percentage of the current price to the
weighted average price of all packaged market prices by brand. Then
some adjustment amount is added to this price to set the new NHI drug
price.

While this method sounds complicated, and it
is, the outcome since 1981 has been a reduction in drug prices. The
table below is illustrative.

               NHI drug price reductions

                                  Per cent

The CSIMC made several proposals that could be implemented by April,
such as setting the price lower for drugs whose market size has
expanded. A suggestion that new methods for price calculation was also
submitted. In addition, a subcommittee of the CSIMC issued a report in
November that included various suggestions to reduce drug spending. The
suggestions ranged from debating the necessity of the drug price list
to paying doctors and hospitals for dispensing prescription drugs on a
capitation basis.

Additionally, the bonus scheme for introducing innovative new drugs was
discussed. Currently, drugs that are entirely new or that clearly offer
safer and more effective treatment can earn premiums of 10 to 30 per
cent on the drug price. Those drugs that are similar to an existing
medication but are scientifically proven to be either more effective or
safer can be permitted a premium from 1.5 to 4.5 per cent, the same
range percentage as orphan drugs.

The proposals to contain costs by changing the scheme for new drugs
that were similar to products already on the market faced strong
opposition from the pharmaceutical industry and was postponed. The
industry was concerned that the effect of the proposals would diminish
Japan's current drug market, valued at Y6 trillion ($62.8 billion), the
second largest in the world, by 10 per cent. It seems, however, the
loss will be less than Y100 billion.

The recommendations concerning prescription drugs represent only a
portion of the suggestions from the CSIMC to cut healthcare spending.
It is expected that this year the Ministry of Health and Welfare will
begin to adopt many of the CSIMC proposals for cost containment.

TAIWAN'S NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE IN JEOPARDY

TAIPEI - The dawn of the new year marked the one-year anniversary of
Taiwan's National Health Insurance Bureau (NHIB). In a speech
celebrating the occasion, NHIB general manager Yeh Ching-chuan warned
that the plan was in jeopardy of going bankrupt within the next three
years if proper changes are not made to increase efficiency and
decrease costs within the plan.

Mr Yeh said the National Health Insurance Plan will be changed to boost
efficiency and win public confidence. The government wants to contract
some of the administrative duties to the private sector to decrease
expenses, while maintaining supervision over the entire plan.

Another move will be to increase the costs for patients visiting
hospital emergency rooms without first consulting a local doctor. This,
Mr Yeh said, would deter people from visiting hospitals when they are
suffering from minor ailments.

Tests and treatment involving high-tech equipment such as ultra-sound
will be charged to the patient as opposed to being covered under the
plan. The bureau, however, plans to ease fees for those patients
suffering from serious chronic illnesses requiring regular treatment.

The health plan has been under fire from the government's main
opposition party as well as large corporations that complain of the
plan's convoluted regulations and the high premiums companies are
required to pay per employee covered under the plan.

A recent survey showed that only half the respondents were satisfied
with the new health plan. About a third of those questioned said they
were "very unhappy" with the plan.

Mr Yeh said it was possible to get the nation's insurance plan
operating in a way that is acceptable to most people, and said the
bureau would work to solve problems caused by human error, waste or
corruption. People will gradually warm to the idea of the new health
plan, he said, but it will take time.

MEDICAL BENEFITS COMPENSATION LEGISLATION PROPOSED

CANBERRA - The Australian government has introduced legislation to
recover taxpayer-funded Medicare or nursing home benefits payments for
injuries or diseases for which the injured persons are compensated
through common law remedies, workers compensation, third party or
general insurance. The practice is referred to as "double dipping".

The scheme essentially revolves around insurers notifying the Health
Insurance Commission of a claim. The Commission then works out how much
it is owed for Medicare and nursing home benefits and after the
settlement of the insurance claim takes place, the insurer pays that
sum to the federal government. The insurer then pays the remainder of
the insurance settlement to the claimant.

Although in principle opposed to double dipping, the parliamentary
opposition parties have nonetheless opposed the amending bills on the
fundamental point that the "cure for the double dipping problem first
proposed by the government is worse in fact than the disease".

The opposition parties argue that the A$40 million ($29.9 million) or
so per year that the government estimates it will save for the taxpayer
will be almost totally swallowed up by the cost of the administrative
machinery operated by the Health Insurance Commission, insurance
companies and other compensation payers.

The most contentious feature of the government proposed moves against
double dipping is the administration fee imposed on compensation payers
to make the government reform self-funding. In reality, argues the
opposition, this is an industry tax imposed on insurers, be they
general, third party, work cover or workers' compensation. In effect,
it is shifting to these insurers the cost of what is effectively a
function of government - collecting the revenue.

Furthermore, doctors, lawyers and insurers have all expressed concerns
about the proposed legislation. The Law Council, for example, believes
that the requirement for the Health Insurance Commission to be notified
of the various stages of the claims process will just wreak havoc in
the areas of personal injury and workers' compensation. It also
foresees complicated disputes about what benefits are associated with
the injury or condition for which compensation is being sought. The
Insurance Council of Australia says the burdens imposed by these
disputes could cost claimants and insurers as much as A$30 million
annually.

NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA AMEND MEDICAL PRACTITIONER LAWS

WELLINGTON/SYDNEY - New Zealand has completed a comprehensive overhaul
of its laws on medical practitioners, while Australia has completed
minor changes designed to prevent doctors from circumventing the rules
on claiming under its Medicare system. This includes tightening the
definition of medical practitioner.

The New Zealand legislation devolves more powers to the Medical Council
in deciding whether to register doctors and leaves it to the Council to
decide whether it will recognise overseas medical training for
registration purposes. Doctors trained in the UK, Ireland, Canada,
Australia and South Africa previously had a quasi-automatic right in
law to registration in New Zealand. They will lose this, although
Australian-trained doctors will not in practice notice a change, as
there are already mutual recognition arrangements in place between the
Medical Councils of Australia and New Zealand.

The legislation also allows the Council to withhold or attach
conditions to practising certificates where there are doubts about a
doctor's competence. It gives the Council the right to require a
medical practitioner to submit to a medical examination or otherwise
act if it has evidence that the practitioner is not physically or
mentally fit to practice and substitutes vocational registration (ie,
including GP's) for specialist registration.

Australia's Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2)
1995 incorporated changes to the Health Insurance Act and the National
Health Act. The changes to the Health Insurance Act stop doctors who
have temporary registration or who are occupational trainees billing
the Medicare scheme for services provided "on behalf" of another
practitioner. This is a breach of their visa and registration
conditions but has been difficult to detect.

The changes to the National Health Act increase patients' liability for
co-payments amounts under Australia's universal healthcare scheme,
Medicare. Previously out-of-hospital medical services were free once
patients had totalled A$400 ($298.5) in co-payments in any one year.
From 1 January 1996, this has become A$600. The co-payment amount is
generally around 15 per cent of the cost of a consultation or
treatment. (All hospital treatment is free.)

NEW ZEALAND ADDS MONEY TO CUT WAITING LISTS

WELLINGTON - The New Zealand government has budgeted an additional
NZ$30 million ($20 million) to manage waiting list backlogs as a
prelude to introduction of booking systems and a guaranteed maximum
wait of six months for elective surgery. The money to cut waiting lists
is for the year beginning 1 July 1996. It will be directed particularly
at ophthalmology, orthopaedics and urology.

The policy objective is to have waiting lists for non-urgent surgical,
medical or diagnostic procedures replaced by booking systems based on
clinical priority by 1 July 1997. Patients will either be booked for a
procedure to occur within six months or be directed back to their
primary care practitioner for continuing management.

Management of waiting times is one of two priorities in policy
guidelines for regional health authorities published at end-November
1995. The other is mental health. Key issues in mental health are
greater availability of methadone treatment and implementation of
individual service plans, including discharge plans for mental health
patients.

Additional funding has also been allocated to essential dental care for
low income groups, breast cancer control, tobacco control and
reproductive and sexual health. In the year starting 1 July 1996, the
regional health authorities will receive an additional NZ$22 million
($14.5 million) for these programmes. Total funding is NZ$5.126 billion
($3.3 billion).

A review of tertiary services was published at the same time as the
policy guidelines, indicating preferred options in terms of the number
of centres for bone marrow transplants, cardiac surgical services,
liver and kidney transplants, neonatal intensive care, neurosurgical
services, oncology services and spinal cord injury rehabilitation
services.

The recommendations are based on the premise that the data on which the
rationale for concentration of tertiary services "is not strong enough
to conclude that bigger is necessarily better for tertiary services in
New Zealand". The Committee which reviewed tertiary services concluded
that it is possible to have a greater number of smaller tertiary
service centres providing good quality patient care in a cost-effective
way which is reasonably in close proximity to patients and their
families.

SOUTH AFRICA HEALTH REFORMS TO CURTAIL DRUG SALES

JOHANNESBURG - Health minister Nkosazana Zuma has drafted a health
reform plan that has infuriated drug companies. The reforms that
include controls on the sale, price and reimbursement for drugs are
necessary, Zuma claims, to address the inequities of the health system
that resulted from apartheid.

The plan, that is expected to be presented to the cabinet soon,
includes such measures as: establishing a national committee to monitor
and regulate drug prices; creating a national essential drug list that
will restrict the number of drugs available in the public sector, with
extension to the private arena at a future date; requiring that generic
drugs be substituted for brand name medications in the public and
private sectors; and promoting parallel importation of drugs from
outside the country, beginning with high volume essential drugs. The
proposals stem from a government commission report that claims if an
essential drug list reduced the number of medications available from
3,000 to 200-500, the country would save about R500 million.

The South African drug industry, worth R5.5 billion ($1.5 billion),
warns that such plans will have severe negative affects, discourage
research and development and discourage international drug company
investments. The country's pharmaceutical manufacturers association
claims that the measures are tantamount to nationalisation and that
price controls have been ineffective and unworkable in other countries
that have tried them.

HUNGARIAN DRUG COMPANIES HOLD STEADY IN SPITE OF COMPETITION

BUDAPEST - Hungarian pharmaceutical companies are getting a handle on
fierce competition from multinational drug giants who have established
a presence in the country since 1990. The companies that have performed
best on the ex-COMECON drug market have not increased their brand name
offerings, but have developed the marketing infrastructure to retain
their strength.

Drug sales in Hungary in 1995 were about $650 million, or about $64 per
person per year. Expenditures for medications account for 39 per cent
of the total healthcare costs, $166 per person annually. Government and
insurance officials agree that drug costs are unsustainable and have
tried different techniques to limit the growth in drug sales.

Between 1990 and 1994, the number of brand drugs offered to Hungarians
has increased by 65 per cent, almost all accountable to foreign
companies. The country's liberal drug registration has resulted in a
market saturated with medications not significantly different from one
another. For example, 29 different drugs containing paracetamol are on
the market and another 51 preparations are being considered for
registration.

The Hungarian pharmaceutical companies are making efforts that seem
successful, in stabilising their position in the home market. During
the past few years, all the major firms have completed or are
undergoing privatisation. With little experience in direct marketing,
efforts have focused on developing a western style marketing structure,
with concentrated marketing strategies aimed at physicians.

Drug companies have been able to stay aloft

Despite relative internal market losses, the Hungarian pharmaceutical
industry has been able to stay aloft in contrast with heavy losses in
other industries facing the international market. Pharmaceutical
companies were among the first shareholder businesses to appear on the
Budapest Stock Exchange and their success is illustrated by the
following stocks on the market.

* Richter, the biggest pharmaceutical company closed a favourable first
half year in 1995 by doubling its previous half year production to
around Ft4.7 billion ($347million). Stock prices rose between November
1994 and November 1995 about 80 per cent which significantly exceeded
inflation (below 30 per cent during this time period).

* Human Rt produces, among other products, Naksol, a preparation for
the treatment of burns. The company was introduced to the stock market
in July 1995 with initial prices about 115 per cent of its nominal
value. In September, there was a corrective lowering of the stock
price.

* Egis finished privatisation in August, when the last 28 per cent
owned by the State Privatising Agency was sold to Natwest. The initial
offering brought Ft1.5 billion, the largest in the history of the new
Budapest Stock Market. The initial stock price of Ft2,625 gained 31 per
cent within five months to the current price Ft3,445.

* Pharmavit, selling generic drugs and vitamins, had stock prices that
fluctuated between Ft3,750 and 6,000 throughout the autumn.

Two other pharmaceutical companies, Alkaloida and Biogal, are
undergoing a gradual privatisation process and are not yet on the
registered stock market.

MEDICAL DEVICES SECTOR SHOWS STRONG GROWTH POTENTIAL

LONDON - Shares in Anagen, a small UK-based emerging immunodiagnostic
company, jumped 19p to 79p following news that it has received US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for its new assay to measure
testosterone. This brings to 16 the number of assays cleared by the FDA
for sale of its AuraFlex automated immunoassay system.

AuraFlex, the company's lead product, is an automated in vitro
immunodiagnostic testing machine, designed by Anagen and built by
contractors. Confident of securing a marketing deal soon, the company
expects sales to flow within the first half of 1996.

Mervyn Sennett, chief executive and founder of Anagen, told IHN:
"Bundling is a word that is beginning to be bounced around the
diagnostics business at the moment. The big managed care units are
integrating with huge purchasing power; they want to do deals across
the board so that they have one supplier for a whole level of services.
The large diagnostics companies are expanding their range so they have
a larger package to offer."

The $15 billion in vitro diagnostics testing market is crowded and
getting more crowded. Immunodiagnostics represent the fastest growing
segment with around $6 billion sales. Anagen is concentrating on
developing the essential high volume tests required by around a fifth
of the immunodiagnostics market. "The market potential is
considerable," said Sennett.

Divestment and consolidation presents major growth opportunities for
scale-minded diagnostics companies. DuPont Co, for instance, announced
the sale of its Medical Product's in-vitro diagnostics business to Dade
International, an independent company controlled by investment funds
managed by Bain Capital Inc, with shareholders including Goldman Sachs
Capital Partners and Dade management. The acquisition will create a
group with combined sales of $1 billion annually, creating one of the
world's leading diagnostics companies. In 1994, Dade had sales of $625
million, with 4,000 staff worldwide. Products include cardiac
immunodiagnostics, laboratory controls and data management.

Other deals concluded recently include Trinity Biotech's three-year $20
million contract as Warner-Lambert's exclusive supplier of pregnancy
tests for the US over-the-counter (OTC) market. Abaxis secured a three-
year non-exclusive distribution agreement with Baxter Healthcare Group
for the latter to distribute Abaxis' Piccolo portable point-of-care
blood analyser to medical providers in the US. The product allows
clinicians to perform routine blood tests on a few drops of whole blood
and provides test results in less than 14 minutes with the precision
and accuracy equivalent to a clinical laboratory.

Medical device analysts raised their ratings on Ventritex to strong buy
from buy, with shares up $1-1/2 to $19-1/2 on 12 December. Ventritex's
Cadet implantable defibrillator for treating too-rapid heartbeat is
expected to be approved on schedule and likely to prove a strong
challenge to Medtronic's Jewel implantable defibrillator line. One
analyst rejected market rumours that the FDA might delay Cadet's
approval as unwarranted. Shares in Medtronic, downgraded from strong
buy to buy by one Wall Street analyst, slipped $1-1/4 at $55-1/4.

Bio-Vascular Inc, launched in the mid-80s and focused on medical
imaging and surgical tissues, posted a fiscal 1995 profit, its first
move into the black. Last year it posted a loss of $0.26 per share on
sales of $6.6 million. The company reported a non-recurring $1.5
million revenue gain in the fourth quarter to end-October, relating to
a licensing deal involving its VoxelGeo three-dimensional visualisation
software. The company's Per-Strip product, an air-tight, staple-line
reinforcement used in lung volume reduction surgery to treat late-stage
emphysema, accounts for more than half of the company's revenues and is
expected to boost sales growth further next year. Its Dura-Guard brain
tissue patch was approved by the FDA in July.

In late-December Vita Signs, Inc announced it had received marketing
approval from the FDA for the company's Viringe vascular access flush
device for both saline and heparin applications. It plans to begin
marketing the device in the US in March 1996, targeting the US home
care market through an exclusive relationship with a national alliance
of home care dealers. Its own sales force will market the product to US
hospitals. European marketing is planned for later in 1996.
