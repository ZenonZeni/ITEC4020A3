<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Electricity created almost magically from hydrogen and 
air may soon power cars, portable electronic devices, lawn 
mowers, and snow throwers.
<p>The quiet, inexpensive, renewable power will come from 
fuel cells that use revolutionary, low-cost materials invented 
and patented by DAIS Corp., a Rensselaer incubator 
company. 
<p>This scientific advance was recognized Feb. 15, when 
DAIS received the 1995 Inventor of the Year Award from the 
Eastern New York Intellectual Property Law Association. 
The association represents patent attorneys, agents, and 
support personnel working in the field of intellectual 
property law throughout the Capital Region, said association 
president Wayne Reinke.
<p>Created in 1982, the Inventor of the Year Award 
recognizes a person or group of people whose invention the 
association finds noteworthy. "It is also an expression of 
appreciation to the community of inventors whose creative 
efforts have advanced the cause of civilization in this 
country and throughout the world," Reinke said.
<p>"The introduction of an affordable fuel cell will create a 
new market for this technology, putting it to work in a 
multitude of everyday uses, such as outdoor power tools," 
said Scott Ehrenberg, president of DAIS.
<p>Fuel-cell technology has been available since the 1960s 
and was pioneered by the Apollo and Gemini space 
missions, according to Gary Wnek, professor and chair of 
chemistry. The high cost of materials has been a major 
drawback in creating these environmentally friendly power 
sources, said Wnek, who helped develop the unique new 
fuel-cell materials.
<p>The DAIS Hy-Air fuel cell uses a new, low-cost proton-
exchange membrane (PEM) known as DAIS 585. With a 
price less than half that of its nearest competitor, this 
technological breakthrough was developed with a grant 
from DAIS in cooperation with Rensselaer's New York State 
Center for Polymer Synthesis. <cite><B><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="ARIAL">(<a href="work.htm">How fuel cells
work</a>).</FONT></B></cite>

<b><p>In addition, the DAIS "Hy-Air" fuel cell uses economical 
new materials for its electrode and stack structure. This 
makes the fuel cell truly affordable to the general public.
<p>The cost of the DAIS cell and its operation will be similar 
to that of traditional power sources such as small internal 
combustion engines. But the fuel cell will burn no petroleum, 
create no emissions, be absolutely noise-free, will not harm 
the environment, and will be smaller and more compact than 
traditional engines and motors, said Timothy Tangredi, 
executive vice president of DAIS.
<p>Apart from the "Hy-Air" technology, there are no other 
low-cost fuel cells on the market, Tangredi said.
<p>DAIS plans to introduce a complete line of "Hy-Air" fuel 
cells this year.</B><P></P></TT></font></BLOCKQUOTE>
