NIST Explains Clipper "Review"  (talk about the neddle threading) <p>

Subject: NIST Explains Clipper "Review"

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
clarified the role of five experts selected by the agency to
evaluate the government's Clipper Chip proposal and the underlying
SKIPJACK cryptographic algorithm.  In a recent letter to the CPSR
Washington Office, NIST asserts that the panel was not established
to provide "advice or recommendations" to the government.  Rather,
according to NIST, the reason for convening the group was "to
provide the opportunity for independent experts to satisfy
themselves as to the strength and effectiveness of the algorithm
in order to encourage widespread acceptance of it in the
marketplace."  NIST concludes that the panel's evaluation
therefore falls outside the scope of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act, which opens the work of advisory panels to public
scrutiny. <p>

In response to CPSR's request for documents relevant to the
panel's review, the agency reveals that <p>

NIST has no records which were made available to or prepared
     for the five experts for the purpose of enabling them to
     evaluate the Clipper Chip proposal.  Any such records would
     be in the possession of the National Security Agency, where
     all activities related to the work of the experts were
     conducted. <p>

This disclosure provides further confirmation that NSA, and not
NIST, is the driving force behind the Clipper proposal, despite
NIST's public role as the "proposing" agency. <p>

The only NIST document released to CPSR is a copy of the
invitation sent to the five experts who participated in the
evaluation.  That letter describes the "key escrow" system and
states that the escrowed keys will be made available "only to
authorized government officials under proper legal authorizations,
usually a court order."  This language -- "usually a court order"
--  suggests that there will be instances in which the escrow keys
will be provided to government agents without presentation of a
judicial warrant.  The government has never clearly defined what
will constitute "legal authorization" under the Clipper system. <p>
