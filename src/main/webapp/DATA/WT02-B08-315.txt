</CENTER>
Ocean Topography is a measure of sea level relative to Earth's geoid, a 
surface on which the gravity field is uniform. Oceanographers use ocean 
topography maps to calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents in 
the same way meteorologists use maps of atmospheric pressure to calculate 
the speed and direction of winds. TOPEX/POSEIDON is the first space 
mission that allows scientists to map ocean topography with sufficient 
accuracy to study the large-scale current systems of the world's 
oceans.<P>
The total relief of ocean topography shown in this image is about 2 
meters. The color scale corresponds to the grades of the relief in 
centimeters. The vertical scale is greatly exaggerated to illustrate the 
three-dimensional perspective of the topography. In this image, the 
maximum sea level (shown in white) is located in the western Pacific 
Ocean and the minimum sea level (indicated by magenta and dark blue) is 
shown around Antarctica. In the northern hemisphere, ocean currents flow 
clockwise around the highs of ocean topography and counterclockwise 
around the lows; this process is reversed in the southern hemisphere. 
These highs and lows are the oceanic counterparts of atmospheric 
circulation systems. While the basic structure of these ocean systems is 
constant, the details of the systems are constantly changing. <P>
Although this image was constructed from only 10 days of TOPEX/POSEIDON 
data (October 3 to October 12, 1992), it reveals most of the current 
systems that have been identified by shipboard observations collected 
over the last 100 years. For instance, major current systems such as 
Kuroshio (the current south of Japan), the Gulf Stream and the Antarctic 
Circumpolar Current, among others, are clearly visible. <P>
The ocean topography data used in this image were calculated by 
scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
Goddard Space Flight Center. The image was produced by the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory (JPL) Oceanography Group.

<H3>The TOPEX/POSEIDON Global Ocean-Monitoring Mission </H3><P>
</CENTER>
A joint effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) and the French space agency (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales - 
CNES) to study Earth's oceans, the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission will observe 
the global ocean circulation for three to five years. The oceans play a 
fundamental role in maintaining the current habitable climate on Earth by 
transporting an enormous amount of heat through their large-scale 
circulation systems. Understanding the dynamics of ocean circulation and 
the role this circulation plays in climate change is the main goal of the
TOPEX/POSEIDON mission. TOPEX/POSEIDON will measure sea levels; map 
basin-wide variations in currents, and monitor the effects of currents, 
such as the Gulf Stream, on global climate change. Additionally, the 
mission's measurements will allow scientists to study ocean tides and 
waves, marine geophysics and wind.<P>
The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite travels in a 66-degree inclined orbit around 
Earth at an altitude of 1,366 kilometers. This orbit allows coverage of 
95 percent of the ice-free oceans every 10 days. The satellite's position 
is known to within 10 centimeters from Earth's center, an unprecedented 
accuracy that will enable the satellite's radar altimeters to make 
precise measurements in sea heights. TOPEX/POSEIDON carries six sensors: 
NASA supplied the dual-frequency altimeter, the laser retroreflector 
array, the TOPEX microwave radiometer and the experimental Global 
Positioning System (GPS) demonstration receiver; CNES supplies the 
single-frequency, solid-state altimeter and the DORIS (Determination of 
Orbit Radiopositioning Integrated from Satellite) dual-Doppler tracking 
system receiver.
