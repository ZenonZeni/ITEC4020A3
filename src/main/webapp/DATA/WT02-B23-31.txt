Confluence Technologies agrees to install its latest version of
FundStation at John Hancock Funds, Inc. in Boston. FundStation
is the PC-based data repository for fund accounting and administration
departments that automatically collects, calculates and distributes
rates of return, yields and end-of-day fund information, and distributes
it in any format.<BR>
<P>
&quot;As part of our total quality initiatives at John Hancock
Funds, we aim to complement our services using state-of-the-art
technology to exceed our customer expectations,&quot; says Ismail
Gunes, Second Vice President and Associate Treasurer for John
Hancock Funds. &quot;John Hancock Funds decided to undertake an
initiative to improve timeliness and gain efficiency by automating
the calculation and distribution process of rates of return. When
the cost effectiveness and functional capabilities of FundStation
were taken into consideration, FundStation became an alternative
to in-house development. FundStation's technological compatibility
to our systems environment, and its versatile distribution capabilities
made FundStation the clear choice.&quot;<BR>
<P>
Confluence Technologies' President, Mike Schiller, says, &quot;We
are pleased to provide John Hancock Funds the ability to enhance
customer services further by providing rates of return and other
fund information in a more timely and frequent manner via FundStation.&quot;
