TOPEX/POSEIDON surveys sea-level heights by measuring the 
time required for pulses generated by the onboard radar 
altimeters to bounce back to the satellite from the sea 
surface. Water vapor in the atmosphere can delay the return 
of the radar pulses to the satellite, this interfering with 
the accuracy of sea-level measurements. To correct for this 
delay, a microwave radiometer aboard TOPEX/POSEIDON measures 
the atmospheric water vapor content, expressed as the total 
grams of water vapor in an imaginary column between the 
satellite and a square centimeter of the sea, at any 
particular point of the globe.<P>
This image shows the global distribution of water vapor 
measured by the satellite's radiometer from October 3 to 
October 12, 1992. The highest values (indicated by red) 
occur in the western tropical Pacific Ocean and the eastern 
tropical Indian Ocean where the ocean surface waters are the 
warmest. Without this correction, a water vapor content of 5 
grams per square centimeter in these regions would cause an 
altimeter measurement error of 32 centimeters; such an error 
could interfere significantly with the study of ocean
circulation.<P>
The atmospheric water vapor is important in itself because 
the heat released by its condensation into vapor fuels 
atmospheric circulation. Water vapor is also related to sea-
surface humidity, which controls the transfer of latent heat 
(heat required by evaporating water) from the oceans to the 
atmosphere. In addition, it is a greenhouse gas that affects 
Earth's radiative heat balance. Monitoring the global water 
vapor content is thus an important task for understanding 
the role of the oceans in weather and climate change.

<H3>The TOPEX/POSEIDON Global Ocean-Monitoring Mission </H3><P>
</CENTER>
A joint effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) and the French space agency (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales - 
CNES) to study Earth's oceans, the TOPEX/POSEIDON mission will observe 
the global ocean circulation for three to five years. The oceans play a 
fundamental role in maintaining the current habitable climate on Earth by 
transporting an enormous amount of heat through their large-scale 
circulation systems. Understanding the dynamics of ocean circulation and 
the role this circulation plays in climate change is the main goal of the
TOPEX/POSEIDON mission. TOPEX/POSEIDON will measure sea levels; map 
basin-wide variations in currents, and monitor the effects of currents, 
such as the Gulf Stream, on global climate change. Additionally, the 
mission's measurements will allow scientists to study ocean tides and 
waves, marine geophysics and wind.<P>
The TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite travels in a 66-degree inclined orbit around 
Earth at an altitude of 1,366 kilometers. This orbit allows coverage of 
95 percent of the ice-free oceans every 10 days. The satellite's position 
is known to within 10 centimeters from Earth's center, an unprecedented 
accuracy that will enable the satellite's radar altimeters to make 
precise measurements in sea heights. TOPEX/POSEIDON carries six sensors: 
NASA supplied the dual-frequency altimeter, the laser retroreflector 
array, the TOPEX microwave radiometer and the experimental Global 
Positioning System (GPS) demonstration receiver; CNES supplies the 
single-frequency, solid-state altimeter and the DORIS (Determination of 
Orbit Radiopositioning Integrated from Satellite) dual-Doppler tracking 
system receiver.
