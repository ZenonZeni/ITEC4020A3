<h1 align=center>Statement by Ron Unz </h1>

<p><font SIZE=+1>I wish to express by strong support for Proposition 215,
which would allow medical doctors in California to prescribe marijuana
for individuals, such as dying cancer or AIDS patients, whose physical
illnesses are best treated or suffering relieved by use of the drug. It
seems absurd and ridiculous that currently such doctors can freely prescribe
far more dangerous and addictive drugs such as morphine, codeine, or phenobarbital,
while being unable to provide their patients with marijuana.</font> </p>
