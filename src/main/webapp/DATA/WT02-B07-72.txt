<BR>
<FONT size = +1><STRONG>A BILL</STRONG></FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
To affirm the rights of Americans to use and sell encryption products, to
establish privacy standards for voluntary escrowed encryption systems, and
for other purposes. <BR>
<BR>
<EM>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, <BR>
<BR>
</EM><STRONG>SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
This Act may be cited as the &quot;Encrypted Communications Privacy Act
of 1996&quot;. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>SEC. 2. PURPOSE.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
It is the purpose of this Act-<BR>
	(1) to ensure that Americans are able to have the maximum possible choice
in encryption methods to protect the security, confidentiality, and privacy
of their lawful wire or electronic communications; and<BR>
	(2) to establish privacy standards for key holders who are voluntarily
entrusted with the means to decrypt such communications, and procedures
by which investigative or law enforcement officers may obtain assistance
in decrypting such communications. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>SEC. 3. FINDINGS.</STRONG> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Congress finds that-<BR>
	(1) the digitization of information and the explosion in the growth of
computing and electronic networking offers tremendous potential benefits
to the way Americans live, work, and are entertained, but also raises new
threats to the privacy of American citizens and the competitiveness of American
businesses; <BR>
	(2) a secure, private, and trusted national and global information infrastructure
is essential to promote economic growth, protect citizens' privacy, and
meet the needs of American citizens and businesses.<BR>
	(3) the rights of Americans to the privacy and security of their communications
and in conducting their personal and business affairs should be preserved
and protected; <BR>
	(4) the authority and ability of investigative and law enforcement officers
to access and decipher, in a timely manner and as provided by law, wire
and electronic communications necessary to provide for public safety and
national security should also be preserved; <BR>
	(5) individuals will not entrust their sensitive personal, medical, financial,
and other information to computers and computer networks unless the security
and privacy of that information is assured; <BR>
	(6) business will not entrust their proprietary and sensitive corporate
information, including information about products, processes, customers,
finances, and employees, to computers and computer networks unless the security
and privacy of that information is assured; <BR>
	(7) encryption technology can enhance the privacy, security, confidentiality,
integrity, and authenticity of wire and electronic communications and stored
electronic information; <BR>
	(8) encryption techniques, technology, programs, and products are widely
available worldwide;<BR>
	(9) Americans should be free lawfully to use whatever particular encryption
techniques, technologies, programs, or products developed in the marketplace
they desire in order to interact electronically worldwide in a secure, private,
and confidential manner; <BR>
	(10) American companies should be free to compete and to sell encryption
technology, programs, and products;<BR>
	(11) there is a need to develop a national encryption policy that advances
the development of the national and global information infrastructure, and
preserves Americans' right to privacy and the Nation's public safety and
national security;<BR>
	(12) there is a need to clarify the legal rights and responsibilities of
key holders who are voluntarily entrusted with the means to decrypt wire
or electronic communications;<BR>
	(13) the Congress and the American people have recognized the need to balance
the right to privacy and the protection of the public safety and national
security;<BR>
	(14) the Congress has permitted lawful electronic surveillance by investigative
or law enforcement officers only upon compliance with stringent statutory
standards and procedures; and<BR>
	(15) there is a need to clarify the standards and procedures by which investigative
or law enforcement officers obtain assistance from key holders who are voluntarily
entrusted with the means to decrypt wire or electronic communications, including
such communications in electronic storage. </BLOCKQUOTE>
