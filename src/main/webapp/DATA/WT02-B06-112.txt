<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy: Part I -- The Unique Nature of 
Interactive Media</title>
<body>
<p>
<h2>Part I.	Public Policy Reflecting Unique Nature of Interactive 
Media is Essential to Ensure the Potential of the National 
Information Infrastructure and Protect Children</h2>
<p>
<p>
The Internet and other interactive communications media are 
fundamentally decentralized media.  Unlike centralized broadcast radio and 
television services, there are no central control points through which either a 
single network operator or government censors can control particular 
content.  On the Internet there are literally millions of speakers and 
publishers.  This proliferation of individual speakers stands in sharp contrast 
to broadcast television or even cable television, where one may count five, 
ten or perhaps one hundred speakers, each of whom controls a channel.  
Federal broadcast content regulators can direct their regulations at the 
operators of a particular channel in order to enforce their regulations.  
However, content control on the Internet would have to be targeted at each 
and every one of the millions of US citizens and international users that 
speak daily online.  Any attempt to impose centralized content control in a 
bureaucratic manner on this fundamentally decentralized medium is bound 
to stifle the growth of the medium, squander the democratic potential of the 
Internet, and may even cut the United States off from the growing global 
information infrastructure.
<p>
<h3>A.	Attempts at "Command and Control" regulation of content 
online will stifle innovation in interactive media</h3>
<p>
As a decentralized medium, the Internet and other interactive services 
have flourished in a largely unregulated environment.  Indeed, recent 
Congressional decisions to commercialize the Internet has lead to a 
tremendous increase in the number of users who have access to the Internet 
and great innovations such as the World Wide Web.  Indeed, the innovative, 
entrepreneurial Internet marketplace has even produced a variety of software 
and services that help protect children from inappropriate material online.  
Imposition of content regulations and extension of Federal Communications 
Commission jurisdiction over standards and technologies would seriously 
retard the growth of the Internet marketplace.  What's more, FCC content 
control is unlikely to be effective in protecting children.
<p>
<h3>B.	Heavy-handed content regulation will squander the democratic 
potential of interactive media</h3>
<p>
As the popularity and accessibility of the Internet and commercial 
online services grows, and as the medium becomes easier to use, the political 
uses of the net have flourished.  Political discourse is facilitated by a variety of 
different communications techniques possible online, including newsgroups, 
mailing list discussion groups, chat sessions, and a host of electronic 
publishing capabilities.  Any regulation creating criminal penalties for 
communication of indecent material would have a substantial chilling effect 
on all who use interactive media.  Such a chilling effect would severely 
inhibit the growth of the Internet as a political forum.  
<p>
Political groups[1] left,[2] right,[3] and center are using the Internet to 
communicate, to organize, and to advocate their own views.  Advocacy 
organizations have found World Wide Web services are critical to political 
education activities, and an increasing number of grass roots and community 
groups are coming to rely on the Internet to keep in touch with members and 
constituents.  In fact, even some Senators offices are using the World Wide 
Web to communicate with and solicit feedback from constituents.[4]  As a 
nation we should be encouraging political discourse in this new medium, 
because of it potential to raise the level of political discussion beyond the 
sound bite and to involve more citizens in the political process.  Encouraging 
political discourse in interactive media requires that all users are assured that 
their First Amendment and privacy rights will be respected fully.
<p>
Indeed, the Internet and other online services are fast becoming a new 
public forum for political discourse for American citizens.  In order to 
preserve the freedom and openness of this new political arena, it is critical to 
avoid creating a chilling effect on individual expression.
