<p><strong>Thin Films</strong>
<P>
Thin films are a promising path to low-cost photovoltaics, and at least eight U.S. companies were planning or building thin-film PV manufacturing plants in 1995. This transition to first-time manufacturing is a period of extreme technical and financial risk. Moreover, for thin-film products to reach their low-cost potential, additional research is needed to develop materials and processes yielding <a href="device.html">devices</a> with <a href="conveff.html">higher efficiencies</a>, more uniform performance over the entire surface area of modules, and lower production costs.

<P>
But high-technology research is expensive, and the short-term payoff is uncertain for today's PV companies. Therefore, DOE support remains crucial. By combining the talents of scientists performing fundamental research with engineers developing prototype modules, we can help ensure that a continuous stream of advanced thin-film technology is incorporated into future manufacturing facilities.
<P>
In 1995, under the <a target=_parent href="http://www.nrel.gov/pv/thinfilms.html">Thin Film PV Partnership</a> program, DOE awarded major contracts to nine industrial partners and about 20 research partners in universities. Through the year 2000, each of the partners will contribute 10% to 50% of the value of these contracts. University researchers, including those at the DOE PV Center of Excellence at the Institute of Energy Conversion (University of Delaware), play key roles in this work. These collaborations will develop prototype products largely based on <a href="#amorph">amorphous silicon</a>, <a href="#cad">cadmium telluride</a>, <a href="#copper">copper indium diselenide</a>, and <a href="#thin">thin-layer crystalline silicon</a> technologies. 
<P>
<A NAME="amorph">Amorphous Silicon</a>
<P>
The first thin-film amorphous silicon devices made in 1974 had efficiencies of less than 1%. By 1994, a small, experimental module recorded a <a href="stabilized.html">stabilized efficiency</a> of 10.2%. Although amorphous silicon materials have lower efficiencies than does crystalline silicon, they have the potential to be less expensive to manufacture. Today, more than 15% of cells and modules produced worldwide are amorphous silicon. 
<P>
Most products using amorphous silicon are low-power consumer items like solar watches and calculators. Higher-power applications will demand amorphous silicon products with higher stabilized efficiencies so that more energy can be extracted from a given module area. Our research goal during the coming years is to raise efficiencies for our best laboratory cells from today's 10% to 13%. 
<P>
Key to the process is transferring to industry any techniques we perfect in the laboratory. To increase the efficiency of amorphous silicon, more than 40 researchers nationwide are working under the <a target=_parent href="http://www.nrel.gov/pv/thinfilms.html">Thin Film PV Partnership</a> program. These research teams are addressing a dozen issues surrounding the design and fabrication of <a href="multijunction2.html">multijunction</a> amorphous silicon alloy cells. For example, one team is optimizing back reflectors that direct unused sunlight back up through the thin layers of a multijunction cell. Another team is modeling the effects of using various combinations of alloys and thicknesses in the multijunction layers and is investigating new structures. Other teams are improving the output from the individual component cells in the multijunction device.

<P>
In addition, researchers are developing ways to process amorphous silicon material to improve its stabilized efficiency. The most promising approach to date is hot-wire deposition. The extremely hot (2000&#176;C) temperatures of the wire cause the feed gases to dissociate, and the active radicals are deposited at rates up to 10 times higher than those of the glow-discharge method used in industry today. The resulting material contains less hydrogen, the agent suspected as the cause of amorphous silicon's instability. Tests in early 1995 indicated that material created using the hot-wire method is much more stable than conventional amorphous silicon; later tests showed that efficiency can approach the state of the art. Future work will investigate the viability of this alternative approach to replace existing processes in industry.

<P><BR>
By 2000, working with industry on device design and material deposition techniques, we aim to improve the stabilized efficiency of laboratory amorphous silicon devices. Moreover, we expect that our research results will be quickly transferred to the production line because there is a mature manufacturing base for amorphous silicon. The progress of amorphous silicon, from technical conception through manufacturing maturity and ongoing technical progress, has been a triumph of past DOE partnerships with industry. We expect the future to yield the fruits of such a combined approach.
<P>
<a name="cad">Cadmium Telluride</a>
<P>
We are exploring cadmium telluride because the techniques used to manufacture <a href="device.html">devices</a> from this material (including electrodeposition, spraying, and high-rate evaporation) can be very low-cost. The technology also promises high efficiencies; small laboratory cells have reached nearly 16%, although commercial module efficiencies hover around 6%. Golden Photon and Solar Cells, Inc., are preparing to bring prototype products to market that should compete with established products made from crystalline silicon.
<P>
Improving module efficiencies is challenging because, despite our progress, our fundamental understanding of the properties of cadmium telluride is limited. For example, some modules have exhibited <a href="stabilized.html">stable</a> performance for 6 years outdoors, while others have shown significant declines in efficiency in a matter of days. We have yet to characterize the mechanisms of this uncertain stability.
<P>
In addition, researchers often achieve high cell efficiencies using approaches that are far from being available to manufacturers. For example, high-quality 7059 glass is used for the best cells, but the glass is too expensive to be used in mass production (where soda lime glass is used). Also, the high efficiencies of small-area cells are due in part to the deposition of very thin layers of cadmium sulfide. No one has learned how to deposit such a thin layer in a module-scale device, and a thicker layer reduces efficiency by about 25%.

<P>
To meet challenges like these, 25 researchers nationwide are working in teams under the <a target=_parent href="http://www.nrel.gov/pv/thinfilms.html">Thin Film PV Partnership</a> program. One team is studying instability in cadmium telluride materials and devices to learn how to design and build stable modules. Another team is working to adapt laboratory cell-fabrication techniques for large-scale production. These efforts should help the PV R&D community realize the potential of cadmium telluride cells for high-efficiency power modules.

<a name="copper">Copper Indium Diselenide</a>
<P>
In 1996, researchers pushed the efficiency for devices based on <a href="record.html">copper indium diselenide to 17.7%</a>, the highest efficiency recorded for any thin-film cell. A prototype power module has been measured at 10.2%. And copper indium diselenide is the only thin-film material with several years of outdoor exposure that shows no deterioration in performance. Yet, in 1995 there were no commercial products based on this material and its alloys. 
<P>
Copper indium diselenide is not yet commercial because significant further research is needed to understand the manufacturing processes. Fabricating high-quality films requires making a copper-rich layer and a copper-poor surface layer to form a junction with other alloys. Researchers studying this technology have difficulty avoiding defects that prevent the formation of uniform layers. However, they do know that using proper temperatures and correctly timing the process steps are critical to achieving quality results.

</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
To reach the goal of manufacturing commercial copper indium diselenide products, 40 researchers nationwide are working to devise simpler, more-effective fabrication methods as part of the <a target=_parent href="http://www.nrel.gov/pv/thinfilms.html">Thin Film PV Partnership</a> program. Basic to this activity is a better understanding of the chemical and physical properties of this material. Researchers in the program have learned much about how the various elements and compounds combine to form quality copper indium diselenide. And, the more we understand about temperature, phase-change reactions, and which steps can precede others, the better we can simplify the process for adaptation to industry.

<a name="thin">Thin-Layer Crystalline Silicon</a>
<P>
Although crystalline silicon absorbs sunlight about 10 to 100 times less effectively than other thin films, thin-layer crystalline silicon cells can be more efficient than those made of other thin-film materials if properly constructed to trap light. The advantage to using silicon is that it is familiar and well-studied.
<P>
So far, researchers have deposited relatively thick layers of crystalline silicon on low-cost substrates. Future work will focus on thinning the material to less than 50 micrometers, while developing optimal substrate, light-trapping, and interconnection schemes.
