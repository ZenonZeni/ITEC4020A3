Vietnam: One-year-old duty-free goods entitled to re-export

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) All duty-free goods imported into Vietnam will have to be
re-exported if they are not sold within one year, according to a recent
decision of the General Customs Department which is valid as of September 20.

However, if the owner of the goods wishes to sell one-year-old duty-free
commodities in the Vietnamese territory, a permission from the Trade Ministry
will be required, and then all import procedures and import tariffs must be
obliged.

Those duty-free commodities that have perished or are broken will not be
re-exported, but the clearance of those goods must be certified by a council
comprising representatives from the related customs office, the goods owner,
and the related finance agency.

The regulation also states that duty-free goods may be sold only to visitors
upon their entry into or exit out of the country. After purchasing duty-free
goods exit passengers are required to export all their purchased commodities.

Vietnam: Perfect recovery of footballer Hong Son's knee impossible

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) Following an examination by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
device, Ho Chi Minh City Medical Diagnostic Center (Medic) yesterday said the
injured left knee of footballer Hong Son will never be perfectly recovered.

Doctor Nguyen Thi Anh Hong, in charge of the MRI unit, said that there is a
bruise between the kneecap and the thigh bone and that the vastus medialis
was torn apart.

Son, the hero in the Vietnam-Indonesia match for the bronze at the first
ASEAN Tiger Cup in Singapore, will have to undergo a surgical operation to
have his vastus medialis re-connected, Doctor Hong noted.

She added that he will possibly have surgery on his knee to take out bruised
clotted blood if the bruise is critical.

The date to treat his injured knee has not yet been determined but his broken
vastus medialis will certainly affect his ability to maneuver on the pitch,
Doctor Hong commented.

She noted: "Even if the knee operation is done well, Son's knee will probably
not be completely returned to its previous condition."

If Hong Son cannot recover his health, this will be a big loss for the
Vietnamese football squad in forthcoming tournaments such as the third
Independence Cup in January 1997, Malaysia Open in February 1997 and the
World Cup 1998 qualifying round in March.

Vietnam: VND10 billion in urgent need to save Oceanography Institute

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) Thousands of documents archived at the Nha Trang Institute for
Oceanography, many of them dated back to the 17th and 18th century, have
deteriorated, and Vietnam needs an urgent sum of VND10 billion to save these
precious materials.

According to a survey team comprising representatives of central agencies,
many of these printed resources have become decayed and perished due to
unsuitable preservation conditions. They include scientific reports published
between the 17th and early 19th centuries, historical reports on
oceanography, and other valuable documents.

The survey team is proposing a project worth some VND10 billion to save these
materials, but measures have yet to be disclosed, according to an official
with the institute.

Vietnam: Memoir: A visit to the U.S. (Continued from yesterday)

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Late Gen. Tran Van Tra

New York is a big city, with high-rise buildings, wide streets
and busy traffic. Nights there are wonderful, with bright lights flooding the
streets. However, it looks commonplace in daytime and is not so clean. The
city is said to contain both the good and the bad things of the entire United
States of America. On my visit there, I saw a lot of homeless, jobless and
vagabond people. It snowed on some days but sunshine still dominated our
stay. On the streets, in the universities and at conferences I met many men
and women in casual clothes behaving in a sincere manner and devoting
themselves to their work. Even at the conference where we were the only
sponsored guests, the remainder arrived in their own cars and paid all their
expenses themselves. After the conference, people flocked to a nearby
restaurant for a party. When it ended, everybody except us pooled their money
to pay the bill. At all the parties I attended, they often drank fruit juice
rather than beer or spirits. I do not know whether this is the best way to
lead a civilized and economical life. To be honest, I could not find
luxuriousness, snobbishness, and wastefulness of time and money here, at
least not among the intellectuals I met. Is it because of this that they have
become rich? One day, the Veterans' Association for Peace invited us to a
Vietnamese restaurant for a party which was attended by dozens of people. The
chairman gave a warm welcome to the veterans taking part who later reminisced
with each other about battlefields such as Hau Nghia, Tay Ninh, Binh Duong
and the Central Highlands and military units such as Division 25, Airborne
Brigade 173, Airborne Division 101, and so on. Some American veterans
apologized to the Vietnamese for the crimes they had committed during the
war. A number of others cried in the most sincere and moving fashion.

It is regrettable that due to limited time and the strictly-organized
program, I failed to meet a number of Americans and Vietnamese who phoned our
delegation to the United Nations and to Ms. Jayne, the conference organizer.
I left the country as happy as when I arrived there. The scientists and
intellectuals I met in the U.S. impressed me strongly but much of the country
was still unknown to me. Likewise, I felt so small when I stood by the river,
in the shadow of high-rises, admiring the Statue of Liberty far off-shore.
I could not approach the statue. I still remember sincere friends such as
Prof. Jayne of Long Island and Columbia universities, Prof. Kit of Cornell
University, Prof. Gabriel Kolko and his wife, who drove from Canada to Ithaca
City to meet me and gave me a set of data about the South Vietnam National
Liberation Front. It has the front's flag printed on both sides and was
compiled in London in 1968. Then an American from Canada gave it to me and
I, in my turn, took it to Saigon, now called HCMC. This was a small but
meaningful event.

exhibition by Nguyen Phi Long, Nguyen Thi Nha Phuong and Nguyen Thi Ngoc Mai
attracted a large number of viewers.

Nguyen Phi Long was born in 1956 in Tay Ninh Province. He was a student of
famous painter Nguyen Thi Tam and began to paint in 1992.

Rural life is always his chief inspiration. After touring the Mekong Delta
and the outskirts of HCMC, he painted around 100 works with simple subjects
such as lotus flowers, Hoa Binh Falls, a country market, and houseboats which
have been displayed at the HCMC Art Association, HCMC Art Museum,
Reunification Palace and the District 5 Cultural House.

Shostakovich's 90th birthday in HCMC

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Dan Vi - HCMC

D.D. Shostakovich, one of the leading "birds" of Soviet music, was a
composer, teacher, pianist, social worker and people's artiste of the former
Soviet Union. From 1947, he was a member of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian
Republic and the former Soviet Union. He was awarded many domestic and
international prizes. He was recognized as a Working Hero of the former USSR
in 1966 and recognized as an artistic academician in Germany (1955), Italy
and the U.K. (1958).

D.D. Shostakovich died on August 9, 1975. He gave the world a precious
musical heritage including  many operas, ballets and compositions of
different genres, the most famous being the opera "The Nose" (based on a
story by Gogol) and Concert No.7 (written at the time the city of Leningrad,
now Petersburg, was under siege).

This year, his birthday was celebrated not only in Moscow, Paris and London,
but in HCMC as well. His life story and a film of his ballet entitled "The
Golden Era" were presented at the Russian Scientific and Cultural House (2bis
Tran Cao Van Street, District 1) on September 22. Tomorrow night, September
25, at HCMC Conservatory, a program of Shostakovich's works will be
performed. This program is co-organized by HCMC and the Russian Scientific
and Cultural House.

Vietnam: New book: "My death begins a new life"

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

Those who died for this country, if there are souls in existence, must be
moved with happiness. They must not feel lonely and sorrowful once they know
that their comrades are still quietly searching the countryside for their
remains. Writer and journalist Nguyen Thi Ngoc Hai reports the stories of
military doctors and nurses and groups of people who have spent decades
looking for their comrades who sacrificed their lives for the good of the
country. People can buy anything with money, except this love, which is
reserved for fellow country people and revolutionary comrades.

The book, entitled "Toi chiet, buat aeiu moat thie giuai soeng" (My Death
Begins a New Life) is evidence of Dr. Tran Van Ban's love for his comrades.
The book tells the story of his long years doing this work and has an
appendix of war martyrs whose remains Dr. Ban has found and returned to the
families.

The book was just published this year by the Tre (Youth) and Haiphong
publishing houses, costing VND12,500.

Vietnam: Company News: Woodprodex in search of investment capital

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Thien Nhan - HCMC

The Wood Products for Export Enterprise (Woodprodex) under the HCMC Service
of Agriculture currently has three production workshops in District 3 and
Binh Thanh District and a showroom at 194 Nguyen Cong Tru St., Dist. 1, HCMC.

Founded in March 1978, Woodprodex specializes in producing high-quality
household wooden products for domestic consumption as well as for export to
Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Thailand. The
European market accounts for 70% of the enterprise's output.

The products of Woodprodex include tables and chairs for outdoor use,
cupboards, wardrobes, carved and plain shelves, etc. They are made from
various kinds of wood such as bung lung, deiu gioa and choa according to
customers' requests.

In 1989 Woodprodex formed a joint venture with a French partner to produce
sophisticated products designed to appeal to the French market. This 20-year
term joint venture has a total investment capital of US$40,000, with
Vietnamese side holding a 20% stake.

A second joint venture was formed in 1992 between Woodprodex and the Scansia
Co. of Malaysia with a total investment capital of US$500,000, with the
foreign side holding a 60% stake. This joint venture focuses on producing
household products. Its duration is 15 years.

These two joint ventures have created 900 jobs for local residents. In 1995
alone, the joint ventures achieved a turnover of US$5 million, 80% of which
came from the second joint venture thanks to its mass production.

In the first eight months of this year, excluding the above two joint
ventures, Woodprodex signed six contracts worth US$430,000 and achieved a
turnover of US$260,000. It is expected that the enterprise's turnover this
year will be double that of last year, and will increase by 50% again next
year.

Director of Woodprodex, Mr. Nguyen Ngoc Tam, said that over the next four
years, in addition to designing new models, the enterprise will pay close
attention to the local market as well as expand its exports to the North
American markets. Woodprodex will also buy some state-of-the-art equipment
and machinery to raise the productivity. At present, to assist it in
developing production, Woodprodex is calling for investment cooperation from
both local and foreign entities.

Foreign direct investment in Hanoi: a sweet fruit with sharp thorns

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Phan Ngoc - Hanoi

"Between now and the end of the year, Hanoi may receive an additional 20
investment licenses with a total registered capital of US$2.4 billion," said
Mr. Nguyen Do Khue, vice director of the Service of Planning and Investment
of Hanoi. These projects, including the US$2.1 billion construction of an
urban area in South Thang Long, have been submitted to the authorized bodies
for approval.

However, they are only prospects for the future as Hanoi is facing
difficulties in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI).

When the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment (SCCI) and the State
Planning Committee merged to become the Ministry of Planning and Investment
(MPI), as in other provinces, FDI flow in Hanoi came to a standstill as many
feasibility studies were delayed by the administrative restructuring. In
addition, some recent changes in Vietnamese investment policy have greatly
affected the flow of FDI in the city.

Around the time of the 8th Party Congress, investors seemed hesitant since
they were afraid that there might be many changes in investment policy. This
indirectly contributed to the reduction of FDI flow in Hanoi, especially in
the first six months of 1996.

So far this year, Hanoi has received 20 licensed projects with a total
investment capital of over US$400 million. Meanwhile, in the first six months
of last year, Hanoi received 30 projects worth US$600 million. Statistics
show that FDI capital in the first half of 1996 amounted to only 20% of that
figure.

Despite great efforts to provide better conditions for investors, the
investment environment in Hanoi is still "very bad", an official of Hanoi
People's Committee commented recently. Site clearing is still one of the
major problems of concerned bodies in the capital.

A number of projects, such as a joint venture hotel between SAS Group and
Hanoi Tourist Service Company, have been held up for four years due to
incomplete site clearing. Another project for the construction of an
expressway linking South Thang Long and Hung Vuong in the Cau Giay area in
Hanoi is at a standstill although Hanoi People's Committee offered a
compensation price of VND9 million/sq.m.

In February the Government suggested that the construction of multi-story
buildings in the urban area should be banned so a large number of hotel and
officetel projects are now blocked.

Hanoi is in an unfavorable position as regards foreign investment; however,
we are still trying our best, said Mr. Khue, adding that further cooperation
with other authorized bodies is required. The target of US$2.4 billion FDI
capital this year is an attractive fruit but one which is surrounded by sharp
thorns.

Current situation of Vietnamese roads

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

By Nguyen Loc - HCMC

According to foreign investors, the bad road system is one of the things
restricting the flow of foreign investment in Vietnam. However, this is also
an element which attracts foreign investors since it can bring benefit for
those who dare to put money into road construction.

Vietnam has 148,000 km of road network including 14,673 km of national
highways and 14,503 km of provincial roads, the remainder being rural roads.
Only 13.1% of the total network is asphalted. Over half of the national
highways are asphalted but they can withstand only 50%-70% of the required
pressure.

Narrow bridges with a maximum load-bearing capacity of 43 tons and temporary
bridges make up 20% of all bridges crossing the national highways.

In general, bad roads account for 40% of the Vietnamese road and one-third
of these are seriously damaged. This is the major difficulty of the
communications and transport sector.

According to the Ministry of Communications and Transport, a sum of VND33
trillion will be required to upgrade existing roads and build new ones
between now and the year 2000.

Priority will be given to upgrading the 2,289-km National Highway No.1 with
capital mainly borrowed from overseas organizations. In addition, the 25-km
road on Hai Van Pass in the central region and the bridges of Song Gianh, My
Thuan, Can Tho and others are now being constructed.

In the North, the 106-km National Road No. 5 linking Hanoi and Haiphong is
being upgraded and widened to four lanes and is expected to be completed in
1999. The construction of the 40-km Lang-Hoa Lac Expressway has been started
and is part of the infrastructure development program of the capital.

In the central region, work on National Highway No. 14 and National Highway
No. 14B linking Danang and the Central Highlands is also under way. In
addition, investors are now interested in the construction of a Trans-Asia
route linking North Thailand and Vietnam via National Highway No. 9.

Meanwhile, in the South, National Highways No. 51 and No. 52 stretching 83
km from Ho Chi Minh City to Vung Tau are being upgraded and will have four
lanes. Moreover, the construction of a road leading to Phnom Penh and Bangkok
via Moc Bai Border Gate, financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is
expected to start in the near future.

Vietnam: Reviewing the works on fire prevention

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

The HCMC Fire Prevention and Fighting Department last Friday held a meeting
at the City Hall for  briefing on the implementation of Instruction 175/CT
dated May 31,1991 issued by Chairman of the Ministerial Board, (currently the
Prime Minister) concerning fire prevention works during the past five years.

That five-year period has witnessed 1,024 fires killing 65, injuring 124 and
causing damages of about VND52 billion. There was a reduction of  24 cases
(2.12%) but an increase of VND29.88 billion in damages (135.15%) in
comparison with the previous five-year period.

Also in that period, the concerned authorities have made great efforts to
strengthen the fire-fighting force including the 3,405 training classes as
well as the investment of over VND88 billion to equip fire-fighting
facilities.

With the above results, the People's Committee of HCMC, People's Police
Bureau, the Prime Minister and the Interior Minister awarded many medals and
letters of commendation to units and individuals that have contribution to
the fire-prevention and fighting work.

review of five years of implementation of Government Instruction 175/CP
issued on May 31, 1991 on strengthening fire prevention nationwide.

The Police Department awarded congratulatory certificates to the fire brigade
sector and the HCMC People's Committee awarded congratulatory certificates
to organizations and individuals who have made achievements in the fire
prevention movement.

Participating in the event were Mr. Vo Hung Viet, Vice-Chairman of the HCMC
People's Committee, Mr. Vo Thai Hoa, Deputy Minister of Interior, Mr. Bui
Quoc Huy, Director of HCMC Police and other representatives of the districts
and neighboring provinces.

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Government
of Vietnam are holding the country's first-ever international colloquium on

Vietnam: Increasing rice export quota

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has officially decided to increase
this year's rice export quota to 2.2 million tons, revealed a source from the
Ministry of Trade.

This is an opportunity for commercial banks to pump more capital into
circulation as some VND2,000 billion is still stockpiled at commercial banks
in the country.

State commercial banks loaned VND2,395 billion to rice traders to buy paddy
from farmers in the first eight months of this year, raising total loans for
rice trading businesses to VND4,200 billion, said a source from the State
Bank.

The same source noted that commercial banks are authorized to lend money to
those enterprises which are in need of capital to purchase rice for export
without being restricted by credit ceilings.

It is expected that Vietnam will have exported 2.15 million tons of rice by
the end of this month.

Vietnam to exploit one million cubic meters of wood

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Vietnam plans to exploit some one million cubic meters of wood
next year, of which 650,000 cubic meters come from natural forests and the
remainder from cultivated forests, an official source said.

Mr. Le Dinh Loan, an official with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, said that the country will also plant an additional 500,000
hectares of forests.

The Forestry Development Division of the ministry, Mr. Loan added, has set
out plans to manage and protect 9.3 million hectares for the period between
now until the year 2000.

Vietnam's total area of forests was 9.3 million hectares by the end of last
year. Of the figure, natural forests were 8.2 million hectares and cultivated
forests 1.04 million hectares.

The total area of natural forests is becoming smaller all the time; Vietnam
had 11 million hectares in 1976, but only 10 million hectares in 1980, 9.3
million hectares in 1985, 8.4 million hectares in 1990 and 8.25 million last
year.

(SGT-HCMC) Enhancement of export-oriented industries and other foreign
earners are among major resolutions that Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai
suggested to HCMC after his recent fact-finding tour to this southern city.

In a notice just issued by the Government Office last Saturday, the Deputy
Prime Minister urged HCMC to restructure its economy by strengthening export
industries and foreign-earning service sectors.

To do so, the city should encourage projects to produce goods for export, and
to expand its overseas markets. Production firms should be supported in
seeking export markets for their own products, according to Deputy PM Khai.

Urban management is another vital task for the city, Khai insisted. He called
for the city authority to speed up the development of new urban centers and
new industrial zones to ease the over-populated situation in the inner city.

"Concentrated industrial zones must be built outside of the city in line with
the general master plan of the city ... to attract people into new
residential areas," according to the notice of the Government Office.

Relating to the pollution issue, Deputy PM Khai allowed the city to use money
from selling state-owned houses to remove houses along the Nhieu Loc-Thi Nghe
Canal. He also asked the Ministry of Planning and Investment to earmark money
from official development assistance sources to improve the city's
environment.

Other issues that the city needs to tackle are traffic congestion,
uncontrolled inflow of immigrants, and loose management over land and houses
in the city.

Deputy PM Khai also urged the city to mobilize all resources to accelerate
its economic growth rate. In the first eight months of this year, HCMC has
made good economic growth, but signals of economic recession and stagnation
in production have appeared.

* Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Khanh said here yesterday the Government
encourages all people to contribute capital for acquisition of new medical
equipment and for developing new clinics in the country.

Khanh, speaking during a visit to the HCMC Medical Center (Medic), reiterated
that the Government supports this form of investment to upgrade the country's
health care system. "There needs to be a statute governing the operation of
a public-funded system of clinics where all people can offer their financial
contribution," the Deputy Prime Minister said.

The six-year-old Medic has developed robustly since its establishment thanks
to financial support from workers of the center itself (accounting for 70%
of the assets of the center). Some 30% of the center's stake is owned by
other individuals, said Mr. Phan Thanh Hai, director of Medic.

Hai, addressing the Deputy Prime Minister, said that his clinic is providing
health care services to some 1,000 people per day. With higher demands from
the people, Medic's equipment and facilities are becoming obsolete, and need
to be upgraded. "We want to turn Medic into a people-funded medical center,"
Hai proposed to the Government leader.

Vietnam: Stricter measures for import-export debtors

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HANOI) Five measures to deal with evasion of import-export taxes in 1996
and 1997 will be applied in the near future, according to Circular No. 56
TT/LB issued on September 17 by the Ministry of  Finance and General
Department of Customs.

The measure for strengthening the collection of import-export debt will be
implemented under the form of forcing debtors to pledge to pay stagnant debts
before September 30 or asking the Debt Settlement Board to either collect the
debt or erase it for disbanded enterprises.

The measure of collecting unpaid taxes from bank accounts of enterprises will
be imposed on import-export enterprises unwilling to pay taxes as of October
1, 1996.

Import and export goods will be confiscated when the above two measures fail.

The measure of putting assets equivalent to unpaid taxes as collateral will
be imposed on enterprises which have not paid overdue import-export taxes due
to acceptable difficulties.

The measure of suspending import-export operations will be imposed on
enterprises which have long overdue taxes or have ignored all the above
measures.

Vietnam, UNDP join to prevent HIV/AIDS in nationwide project

from THE SAIGON TIMES DAILY, September 25, 1996

(SGT-HCMC) At present, a two-year UNDP (United Nations Development Program)
project worth US$1 million launched in early 1996 is providing technical
assistance to the Vietnam National AIDS Committee, the National Women's Union
and the Youth Union, provincial AIDS committees and non-governmental
organizations to enhance Vietnam's capacity to mobilize, plan and coordinate
its policies and programs in prevention and care.

According to statistics from the Vietnam AIDS Prevention Committee, as of
Sept. 7, the number of virus-infected cases reached 4,316 including 80
foreigners and 4,239 locals.

Dr.Roy Morey, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative said
that the conference on HIV/AIDS  organized in Vietnam on Sept. 23 and 24
highlights the need to put a special emphasis on today's youth in and out of
school to protect them from this deadly disease.

Since 1991, the Vietnamese Government has disbursed funding for AIDS
prevention operations every year. In 1991, the budget earmarked about VND300
million and increased to VND45 billion in 1995. It is estimated that from
1996 to 2000, annual disbursement from the Government for the AIDS prevention
programs will reach over VND50 billion.

Today, worldwide, more than 50% of those newly infected by HIV are between
the ages of 15-24, and the number of virus-infected cases every day is 8,500.
In many places, among 15-19 year-olds, two girls are infected with the virus
for every boy.
