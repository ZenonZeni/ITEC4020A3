Biomass Power Program</H2></CENTER>
<p>
<p>In 1991, the U.S. Department of Energy formed the National 
Biomass Power Program to help 
establish a sustainable option for helping to meet the expected 
new electric generating capacity needed worldwide 
over the next 10 years.

The Biomass Power Program includes such core activities as: 
<P>
<OL><LI>working with the biomass power industry to overcome 
problems in using some 
forms of biomass in existing boilers; <LI>evaluating and developing 
advanced technologies such as gasification and pyrolysis; <LI>
assessing the characteristics of
biogas produced from various gasification technologies; <LI>developing 
clean-up technology for high temperature biogas; <LI>supporting small 
system demonstrations; <LI>analyzing biomass power systems; and 
sponsoring cost-shared feasibility studies with industry.</OL><P>
The Biomass Power Program is also supporting integrated efforts 
such as the "Energy Partnerships for a Strong Economy" initiative, 
which includes jointly funded commercial application projects such 
as the Hawaii Biomass Gasifier Project at the HC&S sugar processing 
plant in Maui (see Figure 1), and the Vermont Biomass Gasifier Project at 
Burlington Electric's 50 megawatt wood-fired McNeil Station (Figure 2).

As part of the Energy Partnerships Initiative, DOE's Biomass Power 
Program is currently working in collaboration with the United 
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and private industry to 
demonstrate and deploy cost-competitive renewable biomass power 
systems that spur rural economic development.
<P>A collaborative DOE/USDA competitive solicitiation entitled 
"Biomass Power for Rural Development", which was issued in 
December 1994, is aimed at demonstrating integrated use of energy 
crops for power production. The projects are 50/50 cost-shared 
cooperative agreements with industry, with projects continuing over a 5-year 
period.

<p>
In order to leverage its efforts and increase its effectiveness, 
the Biomass Power Program is working cooperatively with a number of 
other DOE programs. One example is the Advanced Turbine Systems 
(ATS) Program, a joint effort between industry, DOE's Office of 
Fossil Energy, and DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy. The ATS Program is aimed at developing higher efficiency 
gas-fired turbines for industrial and utility use. 
<p>Another important collaborative effort is with the Feedstock Supply 
Development Program, managed by the Biofuels Systems Division 
under DOE's Office of Transportation Technologies, which is 
sponsoring research and development on short-rotation woody crops 
and herbaceous energy crops.
<p>The Biomass Power Program and industry are developing technologies
to expand the use of biomass that include methods of feedstock
production and the equipment to convert feedstocks into electric
power or process heat.  The  Program supports the development
of three technologies&#151;gasification, pyrolysis, and direct combustion&#151;
from the laboratory bench scale to the prototype commercial scale.
<p>Gasification equipment produces biogas that is burned in high-efficiency
turbine-generators developed for the electric power industry.
Pyrolysis processes produce oils from renewable biomass that
burn like petroleum to generate electricity. In direct combustion
technology, power plants today burn bulk biomass directly to generate
electricity. Improving the direct combustion technology of these
plants increases efficiency and reduces emissions. 
<P>
In addition
to developing these three technologies, the Biomass Power Program
supports joint ventures to plan and construct facilities that
demonstrate the benefits of biomass power. Cost-shared contracts
with industry, utilities, and agriculture are building the consortia
and networks necessary to integrate feedstock production, processing,
and combustion to generate electricity. The Program is supporting
joint ventures to conduct 10 case studies of dedicated feedstock
supply systems. In the coming years, an $80 million project entitled
Biomass Power for Rural Development will enable prototype commercial
projects to demonstrate integrated feedstock production and power
generation systems.
