<p><font size="5">Reinventing the LAPD</font><font size="6"> </font></p>

<p><font size="2">By Joseph D. McNamara</font> </p>

<p><font size="2"><strong>Los Angeles Times - October 8, 1995</strong></font><strong>
</strong></p>

<p><font size="2">It would be a profound mistake to believe that
the acquittal of O.J. Simpson of double murder was simply the
jury's response to the LAPD's sloppy investigation, faulty
handling and analysis of the evidence, or to the racism of Mark
Fuhrman. It certainly was that. But it was also much more-a vote
of no confidence in the Los Angeles Police Department</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Once, when I was on foot patrol in Harlem, an
African American woman with a head wound approached me.
&quot;Officer,&quot; she apologized. &quot;I know you're very
busy. but I've just been robbed.&quot; I wasn't at all busy. but
I wondered what we white cops were doing that caused a victim to
apologize for reporting an armed robbery.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The LAPD should view the Simpson verdict as a
similar call for self-scrutiny. If the Police Department were a
private business, it would long ago have gone bankrupt because
significant numbers of its customers have no faith in its
product. Unfortunately, the LAPD, like the Postal Service, does
not have to worry about customers taking their business
elsewhere. Yet, effective policing requires that the department
understand why it is distrusted. why it is losing credibility,
and try to stop it.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">When I was hired to run the San Jose Police
Department, it was known as a little LAPD-a reference to a
military style of policing that alienates minorities. There was
no communication between rank-and-file police and the
neighborhoods they patrolled.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Then, for a number of years, beat offices were
directed to leave their patrol cars and attend school and
neighborhood meetings and to hear what the people thought of
them. At times, it was painful. But in the end. mutual respect
developed; the public began to participate more in police issues.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">Officers learned what services were needed. At
the same time, procedures were improved for receiving and
investigating citizen complaints. A number of cops who refused to
get the menage ended up in other occupations. Most important,
officers began to realize that unless people reported crimes.
provided evidence. served as witnesses and-when on
juries-believed police testimony, criminals would not be
convicted.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">Training was provided for the police to learn
about the diverse cultures that made up San Jose. This helped
eliminate some of the negative stereotypes that can all too
easily flourish in departments. Interestingly enough. the police
made more arrests than ever. and crime decreased to the point
that San Jose became one of the safest large cities in America, a
city of minorities.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">There are no panaceas to prevent crime, but the
military model of policing, which is supposed to scare criminals
into obeying the law, is a failure. What the LAPD must realize is
that it is, above all, a service agency obligated to provide
communities with the kind of lawful policing they desire and
deserve. Community condemnation of crime is a stronger deterrent
than police-state methods. which create sympathy for criminals.</font>
</p>

<p><font size="2">In addition to establishing real communication
with neighborhoods and a sense of partnership, the police should
abandon drug-war tactics and strongly support campaigns to treat
and educate drug users. Criminologist Alfred A. Blumstein has
described the drug war as an assault on the African American
community that would not be tolerated by whites. A study released
by the Sentencing Project bears this out. African Americans and
Latinos, the study concludes, constitute nearly 90% of offenders
sentenced to state prison for drug possession. Ending the drug
war would eliminate many of the racial inequities in the
criminal-justice system and would be a step toward rehabilitating
the image of officers in minority communities.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">The police did not create America's race
problems and will not solve them. Nonetheless, denying that the
police and law enforcement need to be improved only aggravates an
open sore. Disclosure of police abuses during the civil-rights
movement forced a healthy self-scrutiny in law enforcement and
led to increased community efforts to improve policing. The
result was a steady improvement in police relations with
minorities.</font> </p>

<p><font size="2">It is time to acknowledge that much of that
progress has eroded. The minority community, which has the
highest crime rates. must come to realize that it suffers the
most when law enforcement fails to punish violent criminals. It
is not enough to merely criticize the police and celebrate police
failures. Minorities must work with the police to reduce racial
polarization by establishing trust in justice and better safety
in neighborhoods. <br>
