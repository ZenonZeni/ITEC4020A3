<I>is</I> Workspace?
</FONT></B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Workspace is a graphical
three-dimensional robot simulation and off-line programming software program. It
allows users to construct workcells and write programs for robots. Once this has
been done, Workspace has a number of analysis tools for a user to check the
feasibility of a workcell. These tools include reach and envelope analysis,
collision detection, throughput, and cycle time analysis.

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">What is unique about Workspace?</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Workspace is unique for two main reasons.
First, <B>Workspace runs on a PC</B>. Most graphical robot simulation programs
require high-end (and very expensive) graphics workstations (like those made by
Silicon Graphics) to operate. Workspace will operate on any mainstream
IBM-compatible personal computer.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Second, <B>Workspace writes robot
programs in the native language of the robot</B>. Each robot manufacturer has
it's own robot programming language. All other robot simulation programs require
you to work in a &quot;simulator language&quot; that is similar to, but unlike,
all robot languages.
</P></TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1"><IMG
ALIGN="TOP" SRC="pingreen.gif"></TD><TD COLSTART="2"><P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Why
would I want a robot simulation program to run on a PC?
</FONT></B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The ability to run on a
PC, or notebook, is important for two reasons. The first, obviously, is price.
PCs, even high-end PCs, are significantly cheaper than a graphics workstation.
Because of this, virtually every employee has one on his/her desk already. Even
engineers with graphic workstations also have a PC on their desk. The reason is
obvious, most mainstream programs, like word-processing, e-mail, spreadsheets,
etc. are more easily obtained for PCs. We don't feel you should have to buy a
special computer just to run complex three-dimensional workcell simulations. 
<BR><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="shear.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="137"><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Another advantage of running on a PC is it
allows you to take the simulation to the factory floor. If you are off-line
programming a robot, it is important for the simulation to closely match what
really exists in the real world. The only way to do this is to take the
simulation to the actual workcell. With graphics workstations this is not only
difficult, but most people do not want to take an expensive piece of equipment
(a graphics workstation) to an environment it might get damaged. Workspace can
run on a portable computer, allowing a user to easily take Workspace to the
factory floor with a minimal amount of hassle.</P></TD></TR><TR><TD
VALIGN="TOP" COLSTART="1"><IMG ALIGN="TOP" SRC="pingreen.gif"></TD><TD
COLSTART="2"><P>

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">Why is programming in the native language of the robot
important?</FONT></B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">There are
several reasons why robots should be programmed in their native language. The
most important reason is compatibility with the robot controller. With Workspace
it is very easy to send programs to the robot controller. There are no
post-processors to add more steps, and more complications, to the process. Once
a program is written in Workspace, it can be run immediately on the robot
controller. Working in the native language of the robot also allows currently
running programs to be easily brought into, and edited, in Workspace, without
any pre-processing.<BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif"> Another advantage of programming in the
native language is it gets the user closer to the robot. The person creating the
simulation will know more about the capabilities of the robot, and a person who
is already familiar with the robot programming language will have no problem
adapting to using Workspace.

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">Can I simulate other things besides robots?</FONT></B><BR><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Robots are only a few of the machines that can
be simulated in Workspace. Virtually any mechanism can also be simulated. This
is very useful, since few robots operate by themselves without interaction with
conveyors, turntables, positioners, etc.

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">I've tried off-line programming before, and it hasn't
worked. Why?</FONT></B><BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The reason
most off-line programming systems have failed in the past is because of a lack
of understanding of the fundamental problem with robots:  inaccuracy.
<A HREF="http://www.rwt.com/wsinfo/accrep/accrep.htm" target="Main">Robots are built to be
highly repeatable, but little consideration is being given to their accuracy.</A>
This really isn't a problem when using a teach pendant because the operator
positions the robot visually exactly like he/she wants it. What the actual x, y,
z coordinates are really doesn't matter.<BR>
<IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="jclinden.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="137"><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">This is a different story if you are off-line
programming. When you off-line program, you have a CAD drawing of where
everything is positioned, and you base the coordinates of the teachpoints on
this. This, in turn, is where the robot will move to. Off-line programming is
totally based on the x,y,z coordinates.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif"> Due to manufacturing tolerances and
stack-up, each robot is built slightly different. Since the robot manufacturers
make no effort to measure what these differences are, each robot controller
thinks it has a perfect robot connected to it. Therefore, when you send the
robot to a specific x,y,z coordinate, there is no guarantee that it makes it
there. In fact, robots are inaccurate by about 15 mm (0.59 inches), on average.

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">How does Workspace correct for robot inaccuracies?</FONT></B>
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">There are two ways Workspace correct
for a robot's inaccuracy. The first is to account for the inaccuracies found in
the robot itself. This is done with a device called
<A HREF="http://www.rwt.com/wsinfo/robotrak/robotrak.htm" target="Main">Robotrak&#153;</A>.
Robotrak measures the differences between a robot's theoretical structure with
what the robot really looks like. This definition of what the robot looks like
is called the robots <B>&quot;signature,&quot;</B> and like a person's
signature, varies from example to example. Then, using Calibration+, a software
option in Workspace, a filter is placed in Workspace to insure that all
teachpoints in Workspace will be created in the correct x,y,z position.
<BR><IMG
ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="robotrak.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="142"><IMG
ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The second method to improve a robots accuracy
is to more accurately define where the fixtures are relative to the robot.
Usually a workcell is designed in Workspace, and then it is assembled on the
factory floor. The actual, final position of the various fixtures are never
exactly the same as they were designed, and this affects where the teachpoints
are generated. The solution to this is to use a signatured robot to measure the
location of three well defined points on the fixture. By bringing these
positions into Workspace (as teachpoints), the model can be adjusted accordingly
to re-position the fixture in the exact location of the real fixture. This, in
turn, improves the accuracy of the final program.
<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">The best thing about these two
methods is that the software to use them is seamlessly integrated into
Workspace. There are no separate programs to learn or third-party developers you
have to work with. One solution from one supplier.

<B><FONT SIZE="+2">How do I share my simulations with others?
</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">If another company you work with, like a
system integrator or installer, also has Workspace, then you can simply exchange
Workspace models and programs. This allows two companies to work closely
developing and implementing a robotic workcell.<BR>
<IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Most of the time, however, the people you
would like to share your simulations with do not have Workspace. In that case,
you can create an animation, or short movie, of the Workspace simulation. This
is done by using the AVI file format to create an
animation from within Workspace that<IMG
ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="wjet.gif" BORDER="1" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="139">
can be replayed on any PC with Microsoft Windows 3.1 or higher, whether they
have Workspace or not. Any animation created in Workspace
can be replayed on any PC. This allows for
real-time playback of an animation.<BR><IMG ALIGN="BOTTOM" SRC="20space.gif">Animation
files can be used to show a prospective customer how you plan to construct
his/her workcell, or as part of a proposal to get a new project approved. It is
also a very helpful way to convey the sometimes difficult task of how you plan
to operate a workcell. Looking at a three dimensional simulation is a lot more
descriptive than trying to decipher a two dimensional blueprint. Be sure to
download some sample animations below to see how this works.
