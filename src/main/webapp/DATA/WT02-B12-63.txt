of how encryption has hampered criminal investigations?  And how often?  And
what kind of investigations were hampered? <p>

&gt;...  In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I
&gt;believe we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
&gt;the full implications of encryption on society. <p>

I disagree and Dr. Denning contradicts herself.  If the decision is made at
those levels, the public will not be informed.  This policy is too important
to relegate to a back room. <p>

Subject: Clipper standard came close to being not only for phones <p>

Dorothy Denning wrote in RISKS Forum: <p>

&gt; The [Clipper] standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any
&gt; other high speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system.  Quoting
&gt; from FIPS 185: "Data for purposes of this standard includes voice, facsimile <p>

It apparently came close to covering everything.  I have heard from several
people at NIST describing the general unhappiness there about the EES.  One
wrote to me: <p>

&gt; Three weeks ago, Ray Kammer {the deputy director} and Mike Rubin {the
&gt; general counsel} here told people to rewrite the FIPS 185 {the EES}, which
&gt; was in draft form, so that the standard applied to all electronic
&gt; communications, including those not covered under the then current language.
&gt; They refused, even walked out of the meeting, saying that it just could not
&gt; be done.  Ray Kammer backed down, and the FIPS went out w/o the
&gt; all-inclusive language. <p>

{remarks in curly brackets added by L Hoffman for explanation} <p>

In any case, that point may be somewhat moot because Capstone applies to data! <p>

Subject: Re: Denning's thoughts on the Clipper Chip <p>

&gt;The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
&gt;speed computer network. ... <p>

The language sounds to me like it covers ISDN which is rapidly becoming the
standard for non-local networking, all switched circuits, which will soon
include most cable systems, and standard commercial modems carry the vast
majority of all current computer communications.  What do you think the
superhighway is going to be made of?  We have AT+T trying for the twisted pair
as the standard, and the cable companies going for a cable version, and some
chasing optical, but it is all circuit switched at one point or another. <p>

&gt; ...  The standard will make it much
&gt;harder for anyone to conduct illegal taps, including the government. <p>

For someone who lived through Watergate and Irangate and all the other
gates, I am amazed that you can still take this position.  It only means
that the class of people who will be able to get the information will be
restricted to the richer and more powerful.  Anyone familiar with the
telephone system today knows that to tap a line requires only that the FBI
tell the telephone company the phone number.  The rest happens in a matter
of seconds.  With clipper, it will be the same way. <p>

&gt; ...  Keys are escrowed so that if someone uses this technology, they cannot
&gt; use it against national interests. <p>

How much do these escrow agents get paid, and how well are their families
protected?  How many guards watch them continuously? Who are we kidding?
US Nuclear codes were leaked to the Soviets at the height of the cold war.
Do you really think that we will protect these escrow agents any better? <p>

&gt;As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
&gt;systematic poll ... <p>

I know for a fact that most of the major telecommunications providers are
worried that Clipper will be made the standard.  The reason is that they need
better protection and they have to be able to do more things more flexibly
than Clipper allows.  They also don't want to have to pay the company who
makes clipper a fortune to use a technology they don't want to use. <p>

&gt;Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million ... <p>

Do you claim to believe that the great silent majority is in favor of Clipper?
Actually, hundreds of people who opposed it against only a few who supported
it would tend to indicate that 245 Million oppose it and 5 million are in
favor.  Not that this was a statistically valid sample.  After all, the people
who oppose it are probably more knowledgeable than the general public. <p>

&gt;... concluded it was very strong.  ... <p>

In the light of 5,000 years of cryptographic history where experts claimed
that systems were very strong only to find them broken soon after, I find it
hard to trust the hand picked committee of 5 so-called experts who are given
money and time to pass judgement on a technology that is so weak that they are
afraid to expose it to the light of day.  If it is so strong, why not let the
rest of the world review it? The German experts said the same thing about
Enigma, and lots of US experts said the same thing about &lt;name withheld&gt; for
national security reasons.  The infoscape is littered with failed
cryptosystems and failed experts wo trusted them. <p>

&gt;...  I do not believe that our requirements for protecting private
&gt;information are greater than those for protecting classified information.
&gt;...  I am not aware of any recent evidence that the NSA is engaging in
&gt;illegal intercepts of Americans. <p>

It is hard to believe that such a well known expert is that naive.  It is the
blind belief in government that allows it to get away with so much.  We need
more questioning, not less.  We need affirmative facts that show they are
not doing this before we will believe it.  Just because they haven't been
caught, doesn't mean they are innocent. <p>

&gt;The 5 of us who reviewed the algorithm unanimously agreed that it was very
&gt;strong.  We will publish a final report when we complete or full evaluation.
&gt;Nothing can be concluded from a statement questioning the technology by
&gt;someone who has not seen it regardless of whether that person is an expert in
&gt;security. <p>

I disagree strongly with this assertion.  The mere fact that 5 experts agree
that a technology is strong gives me no confidence whatsoever.  If it is so
strong, what's the big secret? If it's so strong, why does it have to be
protected by a special hardware mechanism? If it is so strong, why not tell
all of us so we can start to develop similar systems of our own? How can you
claim it is so strong when you are afraid to even tell us how it works?
History has shown that secret systems such as these are not strong.  The
evidence I use to condemn is 5,000 years of history.  Your evidence is 5
people in a room saying it's strong.  Which should we give more weight to? <p>

&gt;...  I can tell you that it
&gt;is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
&gt;hampered criminal investigations.  ... <p>

If technology hampers criminal investigations, why not eliminate cars except
for police.  Then we could catch a lot more criminals.  This is a stupid
argument.  Let's get better police and better tools for them to use, and not
try to weaken the very fabric of our information society instead. <p>

&gt;     Mr. Rotenberg said "We want the public to understand the full
&gt;     implications of this plan.  Today it is only a few experts and
&gt;     industry groups that understand the proposal.
&gt;
&gt;I support this objective.  Unfortunately, it is not possible for most of us to
&gt;be fully informed of the national security implications of uncontrolled
&gt;encryption.  For very legitimate reasons, these cannot be fully discussed and
&gt;debated in a public forum.  It is even difficult to talk about the full
&gt;implications of encryption on law enforcement. <p>

This is the argument of dictators, not democracies.  If it cannot be opened
to public scrutiny, it does not belong here.  The implications of controlled
encryption are the ones you are afraid of airing.  But I am not.  Controlled
encryption is just another way for those with power to tighten their grip.
What is so frightening to you about encryption that you can't even discuss
it? Is it that people will have privacy from their own government? Is it that
we will be able to assure integrity in communications?  Giving power to the
public is not something to be feared.  It is something to be sought out and
encouraged. <p>

&gt;This is why it is important
&gt;that the President and Vice-President be fully informed on all the issues, and
&gt;for the decisions to be made at that level.  ...
&gt;In the absence of understanding the national security issues, I
&gt;believe we need to exercise some caution in believing that we can understand
&gt;the full implications of encryption on society. <p>

Why is it that you think you understand more about the implications of
cryptography on national security than the rest of us? This elitist crap has
got to end.  It is bad for our country to have elitists who believe they know
more than the rest of us dictating how we will live our lives.  It is bad for
our country that the esteemed members of this forum do not have access to your
rational in order to openly discuss your points of view.  It is bad for our
country that professors at universities tell their students and the public not
to think about the issues, but to trust that the professors know best.  If you
want to serve the national interest, get the debate out in the open! <p>

&gt; ... <p>

In one recent NRC study, the committee rightly pointed out that we need more
open research in this field.  Perhaps Professor Denning would like to follow
the recommendations of that report and open up to us. <p>

Subject: Clipper Chip Politics <p>

At first I was astounded by the hysteria over the Clipper chip but have come
to the conclusion that it is really a matter of Politics and Money - technical
worth has nothing to do with it. <p>

Have just finished reading the Cantwell Bill text on export controls and have
come to a similar conclusion. Lots of good sounding words modified by vague
exclusions. (Could not tell if PGP was permitted since all the user has to do
is install or excluded since each user must generate a unique key). <p>

Clearly, if I were to design a custom mechanism for a client and the client
had the only copies in existence, the old rules would apply &amp; if the client
were "offshore" I would be in violation. <p>

According to the EFF, Mrs. Denning and I must be the only people publicly on
the net who are in favor of Clipper/Capstone as a cheap means for very simple
limited protection. It will fill the great void that exists between that which
*should* be protected and that which *is* being protected. <p>

In the last few months, virtually every RFP I have seen deals with protection
of "Sensitive but Unclassified" information. Presently, this is done with
STU-IIIs and DES. Clunky. Ex$pen$ive. Requires effort to initiate. <p>

Government agencies faced with field offices, telecommuting, and
electronic filing desperately need something that is
1) Cheap
2) Easy to use
3) Blessed by the Government
4) Sufficient to deter hackers and reporters <p>

- not because they are personally concerned about disclosure but because
public law 93-579 (Privacy Act) and public law 100-235 (Computer Security Act)
says they *will*. And for these uses Clipper/Capstone is *good enough* (C). <p>

People bemoan the fact that the government is creating a self-indulgent
monopoly, but I have not seen anyone else rushing to fill the gap (three years
ago I outlined both in magazines and at conferences a very simple means for
access tokens/smart cards such as those from Enigma-Logic, Racal, and
Secure-ID to be used to securely encrypt remote dial-up sessions. No one was
interested. I have not seen ads for the Beaver BCC-007 encrypted laptop
computer lately either. <p>

To me the whole key escrow procedure is a legal sop, I fully expect certain
government agencies to be able to break any transmission within seconds given
the right equipment and all of the keys (not necessarily who has which, just
*all* of them), but I do not really care since anything that needs more
protection will just receive stronger encryption before C/C ever sees it. The
real value is for authentication and protection from volume analysis. (Today,
it is easy to tell which of my missives are protected and which are not. How
much and where can be valuable information even without reading the contents.
With C/C you will have to decode everything to find out which is important and
which is a take-away order). <p>

The NSA/FBI meeting at Bellcore included an assertion that a "National
Laboratory" would be required to reverse engineer the chip.  Does anyone think
that it would not be easier/cheaper to simply buy someone on the inside ?
"Security by Obscurity" may be effective for short durations and limited value
objectives but we are talking strategic value here. <p>

Thus in my opinion, the whole broohah is a smoke-screen. C/C is going to
happen, it will do what it is supposed to, it will become a standard since it
is going to be cheap and enough, and some organizations are going to make
billions of dollars off it - that is just the American Way. <p>

I still want some to play with.  Padgett <p>

Subject: Re: Campaign and Petition Against Clipper <p>

In RISKS-15.48, Dorothy Denning combines some good points with some very
paternalistic and unsupportable claims.  I will primarily address the latter. <p>

&gt;... The Clipper initiative is the result of
&gt;considerable deliberation by many intelligent people who appreciate and
&gt;understand the concerns that have been expressed and who worked hard to
&gt;accommodate the conflicting interests.  The decisions that have been made were
&gt;not made lightly. <p>

In other words, despite the fact that many intelligent and well-informed
people *oppose* Clipper, "we know best, so stop complaining."  The fact that
the decision was made by well-intentioned people does not make it correct. <p>

&gt;The standard (FIPS 185) is not a standard for the Internet or any other high
&gt;speed computer network.  It is for the telephone system. <p>

In the first place, many people access the Internet via various forms of
telephone lines.  If they are encrypted, it will be easier to tap them if they
use Clipper.  In the second place, the Administration has been quite up-front
about its desire to force key-escrow encryption into nearly every encryption
application.  So while Ms. Denning is technically correct in her narrow
reading of the document, CPSR is equally correct in raising an alarm about the
larger issue of high-speed networks. <p>

&gt;As near as I know, neither CPSR nor any other group has conducted any
&gt;systematic poll ... <p>

Ah, the old "silent majority" argument.  I thought that went out when Nixon
resigned. <p>

The truth is that, among the tiny fraction of the public which has expressed
an opinion, there *has* been overwhelming public opposition.  Very few people
have written the Government to say, "my, what a wonderful idea!" <p>

Organizations like TV networks have a multiplier rule they apply to letters,
where they figure that every letter received represents N people who felt the
same way, but didn't take the time to write.  To suggest that only one's
opposition took the time to write, and that everyone else is in agreement, is
at best disingenuous and at worst intellectually dishonest. <p>

&gt; The ACM is in the process of
&gt;conducting a study on encryption.  CPSR is a member of the study group, as am
&gt;I.  Steve Kent is chair.  Our goal is a report that will articulate the
&gt;issues, not a public statement either for or against. <p>

In other words, having attempted to discredit what little data we *do* have,
Ms. Denning is stating that there are no plans to conduct a scientific study
of public opinion.  Perhaps the ACM or the CPSR should fund Roper or Gallup to
investigate a few questions, approved by both Ms. Denning and a CPSR
representative as being unbiased? <p>

&gt; The International Association for Cryptologic Research has not to my
&gt; knowledge made any official statement about Clipper. <p>

I don't see what relevance this has to anything.  One organization of
cryptologists has remained silent.  So what? <p>

&gt; Hundreds of people is hardly overwhelming in a population of 250 million,
&gt; especially when most of the letters were the same and came in through the net
&gt; following a sample letter that was sent out. <p>

The first part of this statement is patently false; the same argument
could be applied to any Harris poll.  The second part, about "form
letter" distortions in public issues, is relevant and important.  All
the more reason to do a more scientific survey. <p>

&gt; ...  I do not know the facts of the 1970s
&gt; incident that is referred to here, but it sounds like it occurred before
&gt; passage of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  This act requires
&gt; intelligence agencies to get a court order in order to intercept
&gt; communications of American citizens. <p>

The 1978 act was passed in response to the abuses of the early 70's.  It
should not have been necessary, since the NSA was prohibited from domestic
spying even before that, but the NSA figured that since the cables involved
were international communications, it was OK to eavesdrop on them.  This is a
rather classic case illustrating the way the NSA used the loosest possible
interpretation of restrictions, rather than actively trying to respect the
privacy of law-abiding citizens. <p>

&gt; I am not aware of any recent evidence
&gt; that the NSA is engaging in illegal intercepts of Americans. <p>

Once burned, twice cautious.  Ms. Denning, think of the egg you'll have on
your face if the NSA gets caught misbehaving a few years from now.
Personally, I don't see why I should trust any person or agency that is so
secretive. <p>

&gt; The 1987 Computer Security Act states that NIST "shall draw on the technical
&gt; advice and assistance (including work products) of the National Security
&gt; Agency." <p>

The question is of who was in control.  There is a world of difference between
drawing on "advice and assistance," and stepping out of the picture to let
someone else do the job.  I believe that the latter is what CPSR is worried
about. <p>

&gt; ... I can tell you that it
&gt; is a fact that new communications technologies, including encryption, have
&gt; hampered criminal investigations. <p>

Without data or references, how are we to believe this?  CPSR carried out, at
great difficulty, some preliminary research.  There is no indication that they
selected that data, and I hope that Ms. Denning is not suggesting this.
Again, we have an attempt to invoke the "silent majority" argument to claim
that the sampled data is invalid.  Only this time Ms. Denning doesn't even
offer anything to back up her counterclaim. <p>

In the first place, let's have some facts here.  What criminal
investigations have been hampered by new technologies?  How many? <p>

In the second place, a pervasive thread in Ms. Denning's thinking seems to be
that there is no room for a tradeoff between law enforcement and freedom.  Let
me point out that crime would drop tremendously if the police were allowed to
search anyone's home at random, without warning, and to confiscate anything
they chose.  But I don't think I'd want to live in such a society.  Similarly,
I'm perfectly willing to let a few criminal investigations be "hampered" or
even fail, if it means I can use strong encryption without fear of
eavesdropping or prosecution. <p>

&gt; The standard is voluntary -- even for the government. <p>

That's not what I remember.  I seem to recall that the original announcement
said that the standard would be applicable to all government agencies.  Is
there a citation to support the claim that it's voluntary within the
government? <p>

As to outside the government, yes, it's voluntary.  For now.  But there are
already major pressures being applied to make sure that this "voluntary"
standard is the only practical choice.  For example, Clipper will be much
easier to export than RSA, Idea, or even the venerable Enigma.  Government
dollars are being used to make sure that the Clipper chip is available and
cheap, undercutting the possibility of fair free-market competition.  And
hints have been dropped that any future encryption made available to the
public will also require a key escrow scheme. <p>
