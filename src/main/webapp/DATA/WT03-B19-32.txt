As strange as it seems in our thin-obsessed society, none of the above behaviors is 
normal or healthy. The more items you have checked, the more serious your problem 
may be. Please check with your physician or a qualified mental health counselor to 
prevent medical, emotional, and relationship problems. Eating disorders are treatable, 
and people do recover from them. Almost everyone, however, needs professional help 
to get back on track. We know this is hard to do, and we appreciate your courage 
as you begin the process.<P>
