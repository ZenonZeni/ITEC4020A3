GERMAN AUTHORITIES DENY FORCING COMPUSERVE BAN

German authorities say that CompuServe decided on its own last
week to bar its 4 million subscribers worldwide from accessing
some 200 sexually explicit Internet newsgroups.

In addition, German prosecutors said that they never explicitly
threatened CompuServe with criminal action.

The denials follow CompuServe's announcement last Thursday that
it had blocked access systemwide to the newsgroups in question
"in response to a direct mandate from the prosecutor's office in
Germany."

In its statement, CompuServe said: "Each of the newsgroups that
was suspended was specifically identified to CompuServe by the
German authorities as illegal under German criminal law."

Munich senior public prosecutor Manfred Wick said Tuesday his
office did not provide CompuServe with any such list as part of
its investigation of child pornography on the Internet. He also
said prosecutors did not threaten CompuServe with criminal
charges.

"We did not make any stipulations. It was the decision of
CompuServe alone," he told The Associated Press.

However, Wick released a statement Wednesday saying police asked
CompuServe to "scrutinize" a list of more than 200 newsgroups
last month.

"The decision on whether and to what extent the groups on the
list would be blocked was left to CompuServe," the statement
said.

"The newsgroups were specifically identified by German
officials," said a CompuServe spokeswoman in Columbus, OH. She
added that CompuServe's legal department was in talks with
prosecutors "and that is something that is going to have to be
hashed out."

As for the threat of legal action, the spokeswoman said: "We got
some information from (German prosecutors) that there was a real
possibility of arrest if we didn't comply."

Wick said German state police will release their findings by mid-
February as to what material available on computer networks can
be considered criminal and what effect that can have on online
services.

He said German authorities consider online services legally
responsible for information found on their networks, even if the
information comes from outside the networks--as is the case with
Internet newsgroups.

WESTINGHOUSE RAISES ANOTHER $3 BILLION TO PAY FOR CBS

Westinghouse Electric Corp., raising cash to help pay for its
$5.4 billion acquisition of CBS, says it has sold its defense
and electronic systems businesses to Northrop Grumman Corp. for
$3 billion.

Northrop Grumman will take on another $600 million in pension
liabilities in the deal.

Westinghouse said that broadcasting will now account for 45% of
its approximately $10 billion in sales and almost two-thirds of
its earnings.

Westinghouse earlier agreed to sell its Knoll Group office
furniture business for about $565 million.

The company said proceeds from the sales will enable it to pay
down more than 65% of its CBS debt.

The sale is expected to close during the first quarter following
normal government reviews, the company said.

Westinghouse also makes refrigeration equipment, nuclear energy
systems and power generators. It also operates government and
electronic systems businesses.

Wall Street was pleased with the price Northrop paid--
Westinghouse closed up $1.25 at $18.375 in Wednesday trading.

AT&T BACKING OFF PROPRIETARY ONLINE TECHNOLOGY

AT&T has signaled that it may move away from the proprietary
software it developed for its online services in favor of
technology that has made the Internet's World Wide Web
accessible to millions.

In a press release Tuesday announcing the elimination of 40,000
jobs, AT&T said it plans to modify "several of the company's
online services to Internet-based technical platforms and modify
some of its messaging services, which will require writing down
the value of some proprietary software and hardware."

AT&T operates the Interchange Online Network, a traditional
online service, PersonalLink, a messaging system, and the
ImagiNation game network. All require use of proprietary client
software.

Interchange boss Michael Kolowich did not return a telephone
call seeking comment, but a source close to the operation said
Interchange will be "moving toward a more open standard." AT&T's
press release did not indicate how long it would take to make
any changes.

The source said the job cuts will not affect the 300 employees
at AT&T New Media Services in Cambridge, MA, where Interchange
is based.

AT&T, which purchased Interchange in December 1994 from Ziff
Communications, integrated the Netscape browser software into
the service in October. While Interchange can be accessed
directly from the Internet, users still must use the Interchange
software.

Meanwhile, Gartner Group, a technology advisory firm in
Stamford, CT, that provides information on the Interchange
network, said it will introduce a Web site for its @vantage
service, which offers insights on technology. Gartner said the
site will begin operation in the second quarter.

Asked if the Web site would undercut the Interchange network,
Gartner spokeswoman Kate Berg said there "is a potential
situation...but the center of gravity is the Internet."

AT&T's Interchange offers access to various online newspapers,
including the Washington Post's Digital Ink, the Star Tribune of
Minneapolis and the New Haven, CT Journal Register, as well as Z-
D Interactive and the AT&T Business Network.

AMERITECH DISPUTES TIME WARNER STATEMENT

Ameritech says it disputes a Time Warner statement that
negotiations between the two companies about offering competing
local telephone services in Ohio have been unsuccessful.

The Baby Bell said Time Warner's real motive may be a negative
publicity campaign, perhaps to delay finalization of Ameritech's
cable TV franchise agreement in Columbus.

Last week, Time Warner, stepping up its efforts to enter the
local phone service business, asked state regulators in Ohio to
intervene in its negotiations with Ameritech on plans to offer a
competing local service.

Time Warner said that Ameritech was either unable or unwilling
to reach an agreement to provide connections on calls from Time
Warner's proposed network. The two companies began talks in
December 1994.

In a statement, Ameritech said the negotiations have actually
produced substantive agreements on many technical and economic
issues but that new issues and demands raised by Time Warner
have delayed finalization of a complete agreement.

"The combination of Time Warner raising new issues at the
bargaining table, publicly complaining to the PUCO (Public
Utilities Commission of Ohio), and conducting a media blitz
seems to be a tactic to create negative publicity and may be an
attempt to stall finalization of our cable TV franchise
agreement in Columbus," said James C. Smith, Ameritech Ohio VP.

"They seem more intent on delaying competition in the cable TV
market than negotiating seriously to resolve issues so they can
provide local telephone service."

Ameritech said it wants to resume negotiations and resolve the
latest set of issues raised by Time Warner. Ameritech said it
believes that a final interconnection agreement can be reached
on all remaining issues.

ATARI FORMS INTERACTIVE UNIT

Atari Corp., a pioneer in the video game industry, says it has
formed Atari Interactive, a new division dedicated to the
development and distribution of multi-platform interactive
entertainment.

"With the formation of Atari Interactive, we are creating a new
division to address the worldwide PC market," said Ted Hoff,
president of Atari USA.

"Atari Interactive will allow consumers to receive our
entertainment products on a variety of formats, from existing
platforms and consoles such as our own Jaguar system, to PC,
Mac, the Internet and Web sites," he said.

Atari Interactive software will feature Atari's classic arcade-
style games updated to play on a number of gaming environments,
including titles such as "Tempest 2000," "Missile Command 3D"
and "Return to Crystal Castles" as well as new games.

Atari said its games will be available in the first quarter, and
for preview through the Atari Web site at http://www.atari.com.

DOW JONES SERVICE OFFERS ACCESS TO NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLES

Subscribers to the Dow Jones News/Retrieval business information
service can now access full-text archives of The New York Times
for the most recent 90-day period.

North American customers can also tap into collections of Times
articles organized by topic, dating back to 1981.

Dow Jones subscribers outside North America will be able to
access the full archives dating back to 1980. Both North
American and overseas customers will have access to abstracts of
articles dating back to 1969.

For many years, Lexis/Nexis, then owned by Mead Data Central,
had exclusive access to archive stories from The Times. Upon the
sale of Mead to Reed Elsevier in October 1994 for $1.5 billion,
the long-term contract was renegotiated, allowing The Times to
sell those rights to others.

PEOPLE: MONEY MAGAZINE FIRES DAN DORFMAN

Money magazine says it has fired financial columnist and TV
commentator Dan Dorfman because he refused to tell its managing
editor who his sources were.

Dorfman has been on a paid leave of absence from the Time Inc.
publication since October when a Business Week magazine report
said federal authorities were investigating his relationship
with a frequent source of tips as part of an insider-trading
probe.

Money managing editor Frank Lalli said in a statement that
Dorfman was fired Monday.

"The serious issues raised about Dorfman and his sources
convinced me that I had to know his sources for his Money
columns," Lalli said. "I needed that information to maintain my
confidence in the quality of the information we publish. Dorfman
declined to tell me who his sources were."

Dorfman had been hired by Money in late 1994 and began writing
his columns in January 1995. He is widely known for his regular
reports on CNBC and previously as a columnist for USA Today.

CNBC, which continued to air Dorfman's regular reports after he
was put on leave by Money, said it was standing by him.

"We believe that a presumption of guilt coupled with a blanket
request for all sources could have a chilling effect on the
ability of journalists to do their jobs and protect the public
interest," the cable channel said in a statement.

It added it had no reason to believe Dorfman had violated any
law or failed to adhere to the standards of the company.

"Under these circumstances, CNBC has no reason to follow Money
magazine's approach in demanding that Mr. Dorfman disclose the
identify of all his sources," it said.

In a story on the firing that aired after Dorfman's scheduled
segment Wednesday, CNBC quoted Dorfman as saying that Time Inc.
had made demands on him that "no responsible reporter can
accept," requiring him to disclose the names of every
confidential source for every story that had appeared in the 10
columns that he wrote for Money.

He also noted that he was not asked for the identity of his
sources before the columns were published. He added that he has
asked his attorney to begin arbitration proceedings.

Dorfman, who had reportedly been signed to a six-figure contract
with Money, has previously denied any wrongdoing.

Artandi, 54, is currently president and CEO of Time Inc.'s Book-
of-the-Month Club division, and will continue in that post as
well, the company said.

Fahey, who has spent 20 years at Time Inc., is leaving to
explore career opportunities in the Washington area where he and
his family plan to stay, the company said.

Appointed president in January 1994, Florio previously had been
president of the New Yorker since 1985.

PEOPLE: DISNEY HIRES PREMIERE MAGAZINE EDITOR AS VP

Walt Disney Co., seeking to focus more attention on writers and
publishers in New York, says it has hired Premiere magazine
founder Susan Lyne as an executive VP at its motion picture
group.

Lyne, 45, who has been Premiere's editor-in-chief since the
title's founding in 1987, will be the studio's most senior
creative executive in New York.

She will be in charge of the acquisition of books, screenplays
and stage plays, and the development of intellectual material
and new opportunities.

"This is an entirely new position created to take advantage of
Disney's expanded reach," said Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group
chairman Joe Roth.

Lyne led Premiere under a number of different owners, playing an
important role in the sale of the magazine in May to a joint
venture of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines and Ron Perelman's New
World Communications Group.

It had been owned since 1991 by K-III Communications Corp.

Hachette Filipacchi Magazines said that Christopher Connelly,
one of Lyne's lieutenants at Premiere, will become its new
editor.
