<H2>Australia</H2>
Australia's aerospace sector has an annual turnover of $1.6 billion.  The industry is based mainly in Victoria and New South Wales and employs about 13,000 people.  Industry turnover figure includes aircraft maintenance and repair of around $500 million. The industry provides goods and services to the Australian Department of Defence and major international companies such as Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell and Airbus Industrie.
<P>
Aerospace exports reached $555 million in 1994/95, the  main markets being the USA, New Zealand and the UK. Victoria contributed exports of $163 million. Imports were $1442 million, with around 80 % of this total coming from the USA.
<P>
Expenditure on R&D associated with aircraft manufacturing increased from $7 million to $57 million in the four years to 1992/93.
<P>
<H2>Victoria</H2>
About half of Australia's aerospace industry is located in Victoria.  The sector is characterised by companies which are export-oriented, internationally competitive and with high quality standards.
<P>
An aerospace precinct has been established in the Fishermens Bend area of Port Melbourne.  Located here are the Rockwell, Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA) and Hawker de Havilland plants, Australia's most important aeronautical research organisation - the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory - and Australia's largest aeronautical education institution, RMIT Aerospace. Ansett Australia and Qantas Airways have large maintenance bases at Melbourne Airport.  About 150 other small companies service the major players.
<P>
Further south Avalon Airport, near Geelong, provides ideal facilities for aircraft assembly, maintenance and refits as well as aviation training.  Avalon is the venue for Australia's premier aerospace and aviation event, the Australian International Airshow and Aerospace Expo.
<P>
<H2>Prospects</H2>
The Department of Employment, Education and Training (DEET) projected sales growth for aircraft and parts to average 5 % through to 2005/06. Much of this growth is expected to come from exports.
