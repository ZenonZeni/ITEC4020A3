Preferred stocks and convertible securities are
other variations on the bond theme that are attractive to some
income-seeking investors. Preferred stocks are included in the hybrid
category because they are more like a bond without a maturity
date than a stock. On the other hand, convertible bonds offer
income with the potential for higher total returns from the capital
appreciation of the issuer's common stock.

<P>
Although preferred stocks represent ownership shares in a corporation
similar to common stocks, they appeal to investors seeking safety
and current income rather than capital appreciation. Basically,
preferreds pay a set dividend, which can be higher than that of
corporate bonds and often are competitive with municipal bonds after taxes. 
Like bonds, the prices of preferreds are affected
by changes in interest rates and are rated by commercial rating
companies such as Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Unlike
bonds, preferreds generally do not have a maturity date, and they pay dividends
monthly or quarterly rather than semiannually. The preferred
dividend is guaranteed and paid before any dividends on the common
stock shares and will generally not be lowered unless the issuer
undergoes some financial difficulties.

Convertible securities are unique investments that blend the characteristics
of both common stock and corporate debt into a hybrid security.
Each convertible represents a specific number of shares of common
stock, which represents the equity element of the security. The
income element is derived from the yield offered by the coupon
(bond) or dividend (preferred stock) and is often lower than the
income on straight bonds although it generally exceeds the income
paid by the comparable common stock.<BR>

<P>
Convertibles are issued in one of two forms: bonds or preferred
stock. Convertible bonds offer the investor a fixed rate of interest
and like regular bonds represent the debt obligations of the issuer.
This obligation means that the company must pay interest on the
bond before any dividends are paid on preferred or common stocks.
Convertible preferreds offer the investor a fixed dividend. Although
the dividends are not guaranteed, they are typically cumulative
and offer a higher yield than that of the underlying common stock.

<P>
For fixed-income investors, convertibles offer the opportunity for greater upside than your typical bond because of the potential of capital gains through the appreciation of the underlying common stock. However, convertibles also have the chameleon-like characteristic of acting more like a bond if the stock price falls. Although the price of the convertible will also fall as the stock declines, it will not decline at the same pace. The income yield of the convertible will cushion the decline and can act as a floor based on its value as a straight bond or a preferred stock.
