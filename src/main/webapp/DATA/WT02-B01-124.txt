November 23, 1995                                              515-262-6957

<h1><center>Iowa Legislative Survey Results</center></h1>
<pre><b>     Iowans for Medical Marijuana sent a Legislative Questionnaire to each 
of the 100 members of the Iowa House of Representatives and to each of the 
50 members of the Iowa Senate.  Our questionnaire asked: "Will you lend 
your support in demanding that the Federal Government allow Iowans with 
legitimate medical needs to use marijuana for medical purposes?"  We 
received 43 replies from the Iowa House of Representatives (43%), and 16 
replies from the Iowa Senate (32%).  10 of those responding in the Iowa 
House of Representatives were in favor of our proposal, 21 of those 
responding were unsure, and 13 of those responding were opposed.  10 of 
those responding in the Iowa Senate were in favor of our proposal, 5 were 
unsure, and 2 were opposed.  The results seem to better than last year.  
Last year, 3 of those responding in the Iowa House of Representatives were 
in favor of our proposal, 7 were unsure, and 8 were opposed, while 7 of 
those responding in the Iowa Senate were in favor, 3 were unsure, and none 
were opposed.  The response to the survey was much better this year than 
last year.

     Carl Olsen, coordinator for Iowans for Medical Marijuana, said, "We're 
doing a good job of educating the Legislature about the medical benefits of 
marijuana.  Many of them were unaware of the present conflict between state 
and federal law."  Since 1979, Iowa law has allowed prescription of 
marijuana.  Federal law has never allowed prescription of marijuana, but 
the federal government had been supplying marijuana to patients on a 
selective basis under a program of compassionate care.  In 1992 the federal 
government decided to stop accepting new applications for its compassionate 
care marijuana program.  Only eight Americans remain on the federal program 
and two of them live in Iowa.  Olsen said, "Health care should be a basic 
fundamental right for everyone, not just the eight people who now receive 
federally grown marijuana.  It's time the federal government stopped 
playing games with people's lives and allowed doctors to prescribe 
marijuana to all patients who need it."

     A federal bill, H.R. 2618, similar to Iowa's medical marijuana law, 
Iowa Code § 124.206(7)(a), was introduced in the U.S. House of 
Representatives on Monday, November 13, 1995.
