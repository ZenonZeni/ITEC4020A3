<H2>Water</H2>

<P>
Victoria enjoys one of the cleanest and most reliable water supplies
in the world. Melbourne is one of the few cities in the world
which
collects water from dedicated protected catchment areas, ensuring
it is of very high quality for domestic as well as industrial
users.
<P>
<hr><br>
<I><B>The study reflects significant international variation in
the 
cost of water. Compared to most of the developed economies,
Melbourne is very price competitive: 91% lower than Osaka,
77% lower than Stuttgart and 25% lower than Kuala Lumpur.</B></I>

<I>Definitions</I>: Industrial users were asked to rank
the reliability and quality of water in each of these cities in
comparison to Melbourne on a response range between minus 3 and
plus 3. A positive score indicates that the water in the city
is considered superior to Melbourne's and a negative score indicates
that Melbourne's water is considered superior.
