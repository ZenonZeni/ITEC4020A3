     Federico F. Pe&ntilde;a, the 12th U.S. Secretary of Transportation, has in three-
and-a-half years compiled an outstanding record of  increasing the global
competitiveness of the transportation industry; improving the safety of travel;
and streamlining the Department of Transportation, while investing more in
America's infrastructure than any Secretary in history.    <P>

     In the area of global competitiveness, the transportation sector is the
healthiest it has been in decades.  Five hundred thousand of the 10 million jobs
created since President Clinton took office are in transportation services.<P>  

     Secretary Pe&ntilde;a helped revitalize the U.S. airline industry and signed
aviation agreements with 40 nations opening lucrative markets for American
airlines and cargo carriers and promoting easier travel for Americans and
tourists to the U.S.  At the President's request, he has conducted commercial
diplomacy efforts around the world, and he is credited with helping American
businesses sell billions of dollars in exports to Asia and the Middle East.  He also
orchestrated for President Clinton the revitalization of shipbuilding, leading to
the sale of the first American-made large vessels to foreign countries in 38 years. <P>

     He is responsible for bringing airline consumers the same level of safety
for all flights -- from jumbo jets to a 10-seater, and he has spurred the truck, bus
and rail industries to promote safety.<P>  

     As for streamlining his department, Secretary Pe&ntilde;a downsized the work
force by 11,000 positions, while upsizing investments in America's infrastructure
by 10 percent.  He rewrote the rule book on financing highway projects, which
has encouraged private financing, and speeded up construction of more than 75
projects by two or three years at no cost to the federal taxpayer. <P>

     He also is leading the way for cities to use new technologies to manage
traffic congestion and has set a national goal to cut American's commute time by
15 percent in a decade; and he has emphasized consumer protection, by
improving an auto safety hotline and ensuring proper airline ticketing and
advertising practices.<P>

     As the Service Secretary for the U.S. Coast Guard, he has provided
 leadership for the nation's fifth armed service to save lives and protect our
environment.  On his watch, the Coast Guard rescued 56,000 Haitian and Cuban
boat people, fought devastating floods and hurricanes, and -- last winter --
ensured the uninterrupted flow of commerce despite unprecedented ice
conditions.  <P>

     From 1983-91, he was Mayor of Denver leading an urban and economic
renaissance, reversing Denver's mid-1980s decline through a series of bold
initiatives.  Most notably, he won approval for the construction of one of the
largest and most technological advanced airports in the world, Denver
International, which, as Secretary of Transportation, he dedicated in February
1995. <P> 

     Pe&ntilde;a also has served as a Colorado legislator and a civil rights lawyer.<P>

     He has received many honors.  In 1995, he was named Father of the Year
by the National Father's Day Committee.  In 1994, the American Subcontractors
Association of Colorado named him Man of the Year; and he received the Se&ntilde;or
Internacional Award from LULAC Council 12, the American Heritage Award
from the Mountain States Anti-Defamation League, the National Leadership and
Service Award from the Travelers Aid Society of Washington, and the Person of
the Year Award from the American Association of Port Authorities. <P> 

     Secretary Pe&ntilde;a did his undergraduate work at the University of Texas,
where he also received his law degree.  Florida International University awarded
him an Honorary Doctor of Public Service degree in 1995.<P>

     Born in Laredo, Texas, in 1947, Secretary Pe&ntilde;a is the third of six children
of a cotton broker.  He and his wife, world-class marathon runner and attorney
Ellen Hart Pe&ntilde;a, live with their two children in Alexandria, Virginia. <P>
