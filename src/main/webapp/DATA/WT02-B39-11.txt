DAILY NEW YORK ANALYSIS

The American recovery is proceeding at an uneven pace, according to
the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, led in those regions where the
upturn is most pronounced by industrial production in part driven by
export demand.  The compilation of reports from Fed districts
confirmed the prevailing view of an economy lurching along in low gear
with consumer spending anemic and the housing sector faltering.  The
credit crunch, said the Fed report, is still with us.  The data in the
eight-times-a-year report was collected before September 9 and so
offered a relatively recent snapshot of the US economy.  If it was not
an inspiring view of the economy, it was by the same token not
alarming either, and was consistent with the consensus view of
affairs.  As recent data have suggested, the Fed likewise found
manufacturing to be the strongest sector.  "Industrial production has
provided considerable impetus to recovery, reflecting in part export
demand and a reduced pace of inventory liquidation," the report said.
"As yet, there is little sign of a sizeable rebound in consumer
spending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery,"
it added.  Bank lending is still soft in most areas, often because of
reduced demand for loans, said the report, which is issued in advance
of meetings of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.
Although mortgage interest rates are sharply lower, home sales have
slowed in San Francisco, Chicago and elsewhere, and commercial
construction has virtually halted in many of the reporting Fed
districts.

Elsewhere, a small rise in August housing starts gainsaid expectations
on the part of Wall Street economists of a slight decline.
Construction starts on single-family homes and apartments rose 0.6% to
an annual rate of 1.07 million when the consensus among economists had
been for a 1.06 million rate.  That was the fifth straight rise for
the homebuilding industry, feared to be falling back into a slump.
Nevertheless, the 0.6% rise was less vigorous than July's revised 2.4%
gain, itself toned down from an earlier estimated 3.7% rise.
Construction in the first eight months of this year was off 21% from
the 1990 period.

Political events were also driving the markets on Wednesday.  There
was a report from Tass, the Soviet news agency, that Boris Yeltsin,
leader of the ascendant democratic forces in the ex-Soviet Union, had
suffered a slight heart attack.  That gave additional tone to the US
dollar but did not have any noticeable impact on the Treasuries
market.  Markets also were watching a faceoff between President Bush
and Saddam Hussein of Iraq.  Bush said US Air Force units would go to
Saudi Arabia to provide better protection for the kingdom and, if
necessary, to force Iraqi compliance with a UN resolution calling for
inspection of weapons stocks.

US CREDIT MARKETS

The Treasury market, which has become accustomed to having things go
its way, did not like look of the housing starts data and sold off to
a small extent but bounced right back.  That was typical of the
session, during which US government securities prices were mildly
buffeted by a series of factors but showed resilience.  The market
also turned down a bit when the December Treasury bond futures
contract ran into some tough resistance at 99 and fell back to 98
18/32.  Prices also declined on news that US Air Force units will be
sent to Saudi Arabia.  The Beige Book, however, was almost completely
ignored.  The benchmark 30-year bond finished the day about 1/8 point
lower in price to yield 7.92% after 7.91% at the close on Tuesday.
The 10-year note moved up slightly to yield 7.59% compared with 7.60%.
Bills were virtually unchanged.

The worst that could be said for the market right now is that it is
indecisive.  However, sentiment is still positive in the absence of
any data seriously challenging the thesis that the economy is not
making any headway and that inflation thus poses no danger.  As we
said yesterday, the market is unlikely to be perturbed by mildly
positive data.  But the durable goods figure coming out September 25
has it a bit worried.  The last one, for July, rose 10.7%, and a
similar surprise could test the mettle of fixed-income investors.  It
would not surprise us if the market took some profits ahead of that
figure, particularly if the trade and employment figures on Thursday
suggest economic quickening.  Money supply, out late Thursday, will
also be closely watched.  Nonetheless, the bias is towards further
price rises and yield declines.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS

Everyone in the market keeps avowing bearish sentiment, but the
dollar's behavior on Wednesday suggests otherwise.  Short-covering on
Yeltsin's heart trouble and the Bush-Saddam confrontation had
something to do with it.  But from our point of view the news breaks
just amplified the stirring of the dollar.  With many participants out
for the Yom Kippur Jewish holiday the market was thin and volatile,
making it hard to draw firm conclusions.  But the dollar looks more
biddish.  In Europe it was supported at DM1.6650 and capped at
DM1.6775, but in New York the news gave it enough punch to reach
DM1.6940 before falling back to close at DM1.6850 after DM1.6750
Tuesday.  Players will probably sell it again, but may be getting
tired of working the downside.
The reasoning behind bearish sentiment all this week has been that the
Fed is going to ease again, which as we have noted before should not
be taken as a foregone conclusion.  Even if that turns out to be true,
is the market likely to spend its time between now and Thanksgiving
looking for that ease?  More likely it will focus on something else,
and that could be US economic numbers.  The indicators out on
Wednesday were not great news, but they were not bad news either, and
somewhere along the line here the data may swing market sentiment.
For now, though, the numbers are indecisive, and so the market is
likely to work in a range for a while, eventually testing DM1.70 but
probably not cracking it decisively.  Therefore we would modify our
advice to suggest that if the dollar explores the bottom of its range
again, it looks like a good buy, but should not be held too far into
the DM1.6850 area -- unless the market shifts resistance up to DM1.70
sooner than expected.
