Budget Negotiators Push On, But Actuaries Say Plans Could Backfire


Budget negotiators meeting Dec.  29 vowed to work through the holiday if
necessary.  "We all know what the differences are.  The key now is to keep
working" on a balanced budget, says White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta.
The greatest concern is to get federal workers, "innocent victims being hurt,"
back to work, he said.  "We want to get this done as quickly as we can to get
federal workers back to work, and get back to normal as soon as possible,"
agreed Senate Budget Committee Chair Pete Domenici (R-NM).

Meanwhile the American Academy of Actuaries sees "major defects" in Medicare
reform plans at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.  Its Medicare Work Group
says both White House and congressional proposals rely too heavily on curbing
provider pay growth when there's no evidence it reduces overall spending.  "In
fact, in many cases, the rate of growth in volume and intensity of services
increases when unit payments are lowered," says a report released Dec.  21.
It criticizes both plans for having capitation rates set "arbitrarily" by
government rather than the market.  That will cause providers to choose
payment mechanisms to maximize revenues, it says.  Hiking rates where they are
currently low, plus "favorable selection" of capitated plans by healthy
seniors, also make it "far more likely" that overall costs will rise, say the
actuaries.  Provider-sponsored networks in particular "will allow for
significant increases in favorable selection."  Providers who make up such
plans "have detailed knowledge of their own patients and, on that basis, will
be able to steer these patients to the program that will yield the most
favorable payments" for such plans, say the actuaries.  The report slams as
"fiscal sleight-of-hand" an Administration proposal to transfer home health
pay from the Part A Trust Fund to the Part B Trust Fund without a
corresponding increase in Part B premiums.  It "gives the appearance of having
solved a problem" by meeting short-range solvency standards, says the report,
but "undermines" fiscal discipline.  The report also blasts the Republicans'
"failsafe" mechanism that would cut provider pay further if expected savings
from capitation don't materialize.  Such cuts could decrease access and
quality in the Medicare fee-for-service program.  Where capitation rates are
also cut, that could mean access to quality care is "significantly impaired,"
says the report.  Still, says Medicare Working Group Chair Guy King, it would
only take a handful of changes, such as adding beneficiary cost-sharing to the
failsafe and increasing competitive bidding, to make "a pretty good plan."

FTC Reviews 'Light' Cigarette Rules


The Federal Trade Commission is reconsidering cigarette tar and nicotine
descriptions.  "Light" cigarettes are defined as those with less than 15
milligrams of tar.  But tobacco foes say the smoking machines used to
determine cigarette content underestimate how much smokers inhale.  They cite
surveys showing most people think "light" cigarettes are safer.  But
scientific studies show that "light" cigarette smokers can often ingest as
many harmful substances as regular cigarette smokers.  They either cover
airholes or suck harder, longer, or more often.  The Commission is thinking
about having cigarette manufacturers list a range of tar and nicotine levels
rather than a set number, or include a statement saying that actual inhaled
amounts vary.  And deceptive advertising suits are another possibility.

Some HMOs Shortchange Patient Care, But Field Pays Lots To Its Executives


Some HMOs are taking much more off the top than others, says a Weiss Ratings
study released Dec.  19.  The average plan spends 83 cents of every premium
dollar on patient care.  But CaliforniaCare Health Plan, with more than 2
million enrollees, spends 74.8 cents, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Georgia
spends 72.4 cents, and CIGNA Healthcare of Virginia spends 71.5 cents.  At the
other end, Aetna Health Plans of New York spend 94.6 cents of every premium
dollar on patient care, and the Scott & White Health Plan in Texas and the 4.8
million member Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in California both spend 98.3
cents.  Meanwhile another study shows HMOs are paying their CEOs more than any
other industry.  The Crystal Report says total annual pay to Foundation Health
Corp.'s Daniel Crowley is $6,147,000 - that's 277 percent above the average
for executives in companies of similar size and financial performance.  U.S.
Healthcare's Leonard Abramson gets $3,992,000 a year - 107 percent above size
and performance peers.  Healthcare Compare's James Smith gets $1,756,000 - 88
percent above average pay at similar firms.  The report, which analyzed
compensation packages of 896 CEOs who had held their jobs for at least 3
years, found that health insurance industry CEOs as a group earn 80 percent
above average pay.  Pharmaceutical and biotech firms also pay executives well
above average rates.

Yet another study suggests costs under capitation are cut most by
physician-owned groups.  A study in the Dec.  21 New England Journal of
Medicine of six physician-owned medical groups paid primarily under capitation
found that, for non-Medicare patients in 1994, hospital days per 1,000 ranged
from 120 to 140, vs.  a 1993 average of 232 for commercial health maintenance
plans in California and 297 nationally.  Rates of physician visits were also
lower than at HMOs; one group averaged 6.8 days per Medicare enrollee in 1994
vs.  a 9.1 average for the state.  The authors caution that the data were not
controlled for case-mix, and could mean merely that the groups had relatively
healthy patients.

Pew Urges Start Of Interdisciplinary Evaluations And End To 'Monopolies'


Physicians should no longer be evaluated only by their own kind, says the Pew
Health Professions Commission.  Interdisciplinary oversight is among
recommendations for health provider regulatory reforms released Dec.  22 by
the Commission's Task Force on Health Care Workforce Regulation.  Nurses,
physicians' assistants, and consumers should be included in physician
evaluation because managed care increasingly involves interdisciplinary teams
of providers, says the Task Force.  Director Leonard Finocchio says
hospital-based, fee-for-service practice skills "are about to be obsolete.  We
must instead use new strategies for ensuring that physicians, nurses, and
other [providers] understand the health care of tomorrow - community-based
managed care that emphasizes prevention and primary care solutions."  The Task
Force also calls for an overhaul of scopes-of-practice rules that have
"created monopolies" by erecting "unreasonable access barriers."  Dental
hygienists should be "free from a financial leash" to dentists, nurses and
midwives should be free to manage uncomplicated pregnancies and deliveries,
and nurse practitioners and physicians' assistants should be able to bill for
their services "without requiring the consumer to make an overhead payment to
physicians," says Commission Chair Richard Lamm.  The Task Force says there
should be periodic competency testing to ensure that providers are current
with the newest information.  And it wants disciplinary files opened to the
public.  The medical establishment is criticizing the report.  The Federation
of State Medical Boards' James Winn says consumers are already on most boards,
but no physicians were on the Task Force.

Not All Whistleblowers' Tunes Unhappy


Most people who blow the whistle on scientific misconduct say the negative
effects are not so bad.  A survey of such whistleblowers by the Department of
Health & Human Services' Office of Research Integrity finds that fears of
retaliation are not always borne out.  Almost a third (31 percent) of
respondents say they had no negative repercussions, and almost as many (28
percent) say they only experienced one.  However, 12 percent say they were
fired, jobs were not renewed, or pay hikes were denied.  Fully 43 percent say
they were pressured to drop allegations, 40 percent say they were victims of
counter-allegations, 25 percent report ostracism, 20 percent say research
support was reduced, 15 percent say they were threatened with lawsuits, 10
percent say travel funds were cut, 10 percent say desirable work assignments
were lost, 10 percent say staff support was reduced, 9 percent say manuscript
reviews were delayed, 9 percent say they were denied tenure, and 7 percent say
they lost promotions.  In most cases, the accused initiated retaliation.  But
institutional officials like administrators, deans, and department chairs were
involved in 88 percent of serious, career-threatening actions.  The report
concludes that, to prevent the most serious consequences, regulations and
enforcement must "primarily" target institutional officials.

'Gag' Rule Gets Himmelstein, He Says


Prominent single-payer health plan advocate David Himmelstein says he's being
ousted from an HMO for violating its 'gag' rule.  The Physicians for a
National Health Program co-founder contends that U.S.  Healthcare is dropping
him for comments he made at a National Managed Healthcare Congress.  He showed
a slide of the confidentiality or 'gag' clause prohibiting member physicians
from saying anything that could "undermine confidence" in the plan.  He also
complained about referral disincentives and the CEO's multimillion dollar
salary, and made similar comments on the "Donahue" show.  "It is not illegal
for them to fire me," he concedes.  "We need a law outlawing" gag rules and to
throw firms that use them out of health care, he says.  U.S.  Healthcare says
it is dropping Himmelstein because it has too many doctors in his area, but
Himmelstein says the plan is hiring.  The HMO industry says confidentiality
clauses aren't designed to curtail patient advocacy, and merely protect
proprietary information.  But gag rules were repeatedly attacked at last
month's American Medical Association meeting.  The AMA has many of its own
employees sign confidentiality agreements.  Nonetheless, its Council on
Ethical & Judicial Affairs is drafting policy on the issue that may be ready
for the Association's June meeting.

Double-Digit Indemnity Hikes Predicted


Only loosely-managed indemnity plans will see costs rise by more than 10
percent in 1996, predicts the Alexander & Alexander Consulting group.  Its
survey of self-funded, employer-sponsored medical plans suggests that
preferred provider organizations will see increases of 9 percent to 10
percent.  Point-of-service HMOs that let members see out-of-plan physicians
will cost 5 percent to 7 percent more.  And closed-panel HMOs will see costs
rise by at most 4 percent, if at all, says the survey.  It found little
difference among regions, except for higher indemnity plan increases of 15
percent in California.  Meanwhile Interstudy predicts Boston, Nassau-Suffolk
NY, Philadelphia, Tampa-St.  Petersburg, and St.  Louis will lead large
markets' HMO growth in 1996.  Fastest-growing medium size markets include West
Palm Beach-Boca Raton FL, Albany-Schenectady NY, Springfield MA, Worcester MA,
and Knoxville TN.

Hospitals Happier With JCAHO Surveys


Hospital are more satisfied with Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) onsite surveys, according to an American
Hospital Association (AHA) survey.  The survey, conducted in November, found
that 64 percent of hospitals "strongly" agree that they are satisfied, up from
48 percent last August.  Just one year ago relations between JCAHO and
hospitals were so bad AHA was talking about withdrawing its support from the
accrediting body.  Hospitals are unhappy with delays in getting written
accreditation reports after onsite surveys.  Only 63 percent said reports were
delivered within a reasonable time, down from 76 percent in August.  JCAHO
says a computer system caused delays.  The number of hospitals who feel the
JCAHO survey was of value stayed at about 80 percent.  But the number who feel
it's worth the fees charged is up slightly.

Approval Fails To Quell Controversy Over 'Sensor Pad' Breast Lump Device


Foes and fans dislike the Dec.  22 Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approval
of the Sensor Pad.  The 10-year tussle over the purported breast lump
detection aide is one of FDA critics' favorite examples of alleged agency
arrogance and intransigence.  The FDA says it granted approval now because
data submitted in November show that the product, two sheets of plastic
sliding over a silicone filling, does not decrease detection of lumps.  An FDA
advisory panel asked the manufacturer, Inventive Products Inc., for such
evidence earlier in the year.  But Pad critics say there's still no proof that
it improves lump detection.  And Pad supporters say the approval, allowing
sales only in clinics and physicians' offices, is too narrow.  Both camps
claim the action was political.  Advocates of legislation to allow
over-the-counter sales plan to push ahead.

VT Hospitals Decry Scaled-Back Reform


The exclusion of inpatient coverage from sharply curtailed health reform plans
in Vermont has hospitals crying foul.  Legislation was passed last spring to
enroll everyone below 150 percent of the poverty level in managed care.  But
only one out-of-state, for-profit plan successfully bid, and it didn't have
the infrastructure to meet the Jan.  1 target startup date.  Providers say the
contract it offered was not for true managed care but "discount
fee-for-service" that indemnified the plan against any decisions it made.  The
state is going ahead with enrollments in a "limited fee-for-service" plan,
albeit only for people below 100 percent of the poverty level.  The governor's
office says inpatient coverage won't be provided until at least two managed
care plans are participating.  But hospitals feel cheated.  The whole package
wouldn't have passed without their support, says hospital association
President Norm Wright.

Briefly This Week...


The largest provider of insurance to cover gaps in Medicare coverage is
increasing premium costs 30 percent on average.  The 3.1 million seniors with
American Association of Retired Persons "Medigap" policies will be charged on
average $51 per month for the most basic and $151.75 for the most complete
plan.  Growth of outpatient claims is being blamed.

Hospitals can now check the Internet to see if they're getting a good deal on
disposable products.  PriceGuide, from the nonprofit research agency ECRI,
provides both national and geographic average price and lowest price paid by
hospitals for brandname disposables.  A test of the system for cardiac
catherization labs found average potential savings of $243,000 per hospital,
says ECRI.

The Food & Drug Administration may allow more flexibility for food label
health claims.  A proposed rule in the Dec.  21 Federal Register would allow
synonymous nutrient content claims next to the required standard text, permit
health claims for certain foods that don't contain at least 10 percent of
required nutrients, eliminate some requirements for health claims, and make
other refinements in regulations issued two years ago.

Malpractice awards are back up to 1993's record setting $500,000 median, says
a Jury Verdict Research report.  The 1995 figure is a 40 percent jump from
1994's $365,000.  Since 1990, says a Tillinghast-Towers Perrin study,
malpractice costs rose 48.6 percent, vs.  16.6 percent for overall tort costs.

University of California/San Francisco has the greatest percentage of
underrepresented minority graduates among non-historically black medical
schools, according to Association of American Medical Colleges statistics.
From 1990 to 1994, 21 percent of UCSF graduates were Native-, African-,
Mexican-American, or Puerto Rican.  Saint Louis University ranks last with
0.57 percent.

The drug AZT given after needle sticks cuts HIV infection rates by 79 percent,
says the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention.  The agency plans to hold a
meeting on possible new needle stick injury guidelines.

Prozac is more cost-effective than other selective serotonin re-uptake
inhibitors used to treat depression, says a report in the November/December
Journal of International Medical Research.  Annual mean health care costs are
$442 for patients taking Prozac, $744 for those on Paxil, and $756 for those
on Zoloft.  More frequent dose changes on the last two explain much of the
difference.

The American Jewish Congress is protesting a Health Care Financing
Administration decision to not require nursing homes to take account of
residents' religious dietary restrictions.  The Congress is upset by a letter
from a HCFA staffer saying that the government "does not impose any" religious
practices, and that patients with religious dietary needs "should choose a
home that adheres to those" rules.

Year In Review:  Ghost of Reform Returns to Haunt GOP


A poignant and ironic spectacle unfolded in 1995 as victorious Republicans in
Congress lifted the burden of leadership in health care reform from the
shoulders of a battered Democratic Administration - and then staggered under
the load just as the Democrats had.

Initially, the collapse of universal coverage and comprehensive federal
reforms in the 103rd Congress appeared to leave in its wake an agenda of
incremental policy measures for the states and the new Congress to take up.
But the budgetary goals of the new Republican majority soon put systemwide
reform of Medicare and Medicaid back at the top of the national agenda.

The Republicans had no more choice than Clinton but to shape policy in the
image of the breathtaking changes taking place in the private market.  Despite
all the partisan rhetoric and rancor, the Republicans wanted to do for
Medicare and Medicaid what Clinton tried to do for the system as a whole -
facilitate a minimally-disruptive transition to the new order.

"The events of 1993 and 1994 may have put proposals for government-guaranteed
universal coverage and cost control in the deep freeze, but they assuredly did
not cool political interest in health care policy," writes Henry Aaron, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, in a new book.

Federal budget pressures, combined with the aging of the population and
continuing technological advances, ensure that "health care financing as a
national political issue will not go away," according to Aaron.  But the terms
of the debate will change.  "Public and private policy in the United States
are combining to transform the health care financing system in ways that were
not widely foreseen when the Clinton administration made health care reform
its number one domestic priority."

Incrementalism Deferred

In the states and the Congress, incremental change was the order of the day as
1995 began.  Most of the states were implementing insurance-market reforms.
Organized medicine and the managed care industry were fighting a
state-by-state war over any-willing-provider laws, the latest in a long series
of state reform issues clouded by the formidable influence of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  But the most urgent issue for the
states was the uncontrolled growth of Medicaid costs.

Consolidation of payers and providers continued in the marketplace, with
physician practices and practice management companies contributing
increasingly to the trend.  Despite the eclipse of health purchasing alliances
in the national policy sphere, several states were sponsoring alliances, and
business buyer coalitions continued to form.  For the second consecutive year
health plan premiums were under control - growing at or below the general
inflation rate, or down.

In May, details of the Republican plan for Medicare began to emerge.  The
hallmark of the proposal was the opening of the Medicare market to a
relatively unrestricted variety of competing health plans, with special
treatment for those sponsored by providers.  Medical savings accounts (MSAs)
would be an option for those who preferred to receive their benefit in cash.
Increased cost-sharing was dropped as a penalty for beneficiaries who wanted
to stay in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service system, but retrospective
cuts in reimbursement would penalize fee-for-service providers if budget
targets were not met.

As expected, the Republicans proposed abolishing Medicaid as an entitlement
for the poor and disabled and converting the program to block grants for the
states.  The puissant National Governors' Association hailed the block grant
concept, but was handcuffed by divisions - across party lines - over proposed
allocation formulas.

Obstacles to the Medicare plan seemed to melt away in the face of the
Republicans' tight party discipline and focus on budget goals.  Sen.  Alan
Simpson's (R-WY) attacks on the tax-exempt status of the American Association
of Retired Persons (AARP) helped distract the seniors' strongest lobbying arm
and forestall frontal resistance to Medicare budget reductions per se.  House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) worked assiduously to maintain the AARP's
relative quiescence.  The American Hospital Association apparently succumbed
to implicit threats that there would be no seat at the table for stakeholders
who went negative in public.

The coup de grace came in September when the American Medical Association
announced its support for the GOP Medicare plan.  As Aaron suggests, the
ground had shifted under the policymakers' feet.  Out-and-out warfare between
organized medicine and the managed care industry had been a major distraction
during the fight over the Clinton plan.  Now, many in the AMA believed that
provider-sponsored plans would be their salvation.

Republican unity and finesse in neutralizing potential opposition did not work
as well on Medicaid.  The nation's governors were offering their acquiescence
to tight constraints on federal Medicaid spending in exchange for freedom to
run the program without federal interference.  Republican moderates in the
Senate, however, led by Maine's William Cohen, refused to accept repeal of
federal nursing home standards, and the Republicans lost their grip on a
veto-proof strategy for this mother of all step-child programs.

Stab In the Dark

With passage of the Republican budget bill and the ensuing Presidential veto,
the policy debate moves out of the subjunctive mode.  The questions are no
longer:  "What if we do this?"  or "What if we do that?"  They become:
"What's going to happen when we do this?"  and "What if it turns out to be a
disaster?"

But even changes that are near at hand are difficult to visualize.
Provider-sponsored organizations (PSOs), for example, are an unknown quantity
in Medicare and the marketplace generally.  They will be subject to varying
state licensure requirements and solvency standards overseen by the Secretary
of Health & Human Services.  PSOs may provide a sort of haven for doctors.
But if their sickest patients follow them, the doctors are in for some jolting
lessons in risk selection.

The pace of Medicare enrollment in managed care is another crucial variable
that is impossible to forecast, according to Guy King, who was chief actuary
at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for 16 years and is
currently chair of a working group on Medicare in the American Academy of
Actuaries (AAA).

"Any estimate there is really a stab in the dark, because you've got two
offsetting things going on," King says.  Opening the Medicare choice market to
all comers will facilitate expansion of enrollment, but lowering capitation
rates will have a constricting effect, he says.  An additional downward
adjustment of rates will be made in areas that currently have relatively high
capitation payments, slowing growth where it is now most vigorous, King warns.

The AAA workgroup faulted both the Republican MediPlus plan and President
Clinton's proposal for maintaining a system of capitation payments "determined
arbitrarily by the government, rather than the market."  (See this week's M&H,
p.  2.)  King suggests that the Republican plan could be fixed with a system
of blind price-and-product bidding by plans, against fixed per capita payments
then set by HCFA; and by increases in cost sharing for beneficiaries who
choose expensive coverages.

To preempt Democratic criticism and mobilization of the seniors' lobby, the
Republicans dropped beneficiary cost sharing from the retrospective failsafe
mechanism on the fee-for-service side of the program, which still accounts for
90 percent of all enrollment.  By inflicting on providers all of the pain from
the lookback mechanism, the Republicans risk driving doctors and hospitals out
of Medicare and pinching off access for many beneficiaries, according to King
and others.

Greater access problems could result from curtailment of Medicaid growth to
4.8 percent per year, combined with a continuing erosion of employment-based
coverage, according to a recent analysis by Harvard University health
economist Kenneth Thorpe - a former Clinton advisor - and others.

Recent data indicate that the percentage of the population covered through the
workplace fell from 61 percent four years ago to less than 57 percent in 1994.
Reductions in Medicaid coverage by the states could freeze out growing numbers
of workers who lose job-based coverage in the future, pushing the number of
uninsured as high as 66 million in 2002 in a worst-case scenario, Thorpe and
his colleagues estimated.  Lewin-VHI expects 45.9 million to be uninsured in
2002.

Dramatic growth in the number of uninsured would lead to public discontent and
"pressures for a revived and heightened role of government," Aaron predicts.
And according to King, "You and I both know that what's really going to happen
is that if access to care and quality of care start suffering in the
[traditional] Medicare program, that something's going to be done."

The Medicare Preservation Act calls for a national MedicarePlus Health Fair in
October 1996 "which would provide for a nationally coordinated educational and
publicity campaign to inform MedicarePlus eligible persons about MedicarePlus
plans, and the election [choice] process, including the upcoming annual,
coordinated election periods that would begin in October 1997."

Candidates, start your engines.

In Other Business...


Academic health centers (AHCs) survived the storm of deficit reduction without
catastrophic losses to their shrinking revenue base.  Medicare-based subsidies
were largely salvaged by creation of a trust fund for graduate medical
education.  Plans to slash funding for the National Institutes of Health were
blocked.  But with cross subsidies for research and teaching drying up on all
sides, AHCs were looking increasingly to partner with managed care systems to
broaden their financial and patient base.

The Agency for Health Care Policy & Research (AHCPR) was targeted for
extinction by Republican budget hawks, then resurrected after an impressive
show of support from its friends, including influential voices in the
corporate community who value medical effectiveness research.  In its ongoing
work, AHCPR placed increasing emphasis on efforts to implement practice
guidelines as well as develop them, and to renegotiate the roles of
specialists in managed care.

The Business Health Care Action Group in Minnesota turned heads among the
managed care elite with plans to solicit direct bids from competing provider
groups within the big integrated health plans that dominate the
Minneapolis/St.  Paul market.

Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp.  acquired more than 40 new hospitals during the
year, most of them former nonprofits.  The Nashville TN powerhouse put a
notable new jewel in its crown in December with the announcement of a joint
venture with the respected Sharp HealthCare in San Diego.  Consumer advocates
vowed to make sure Sharp's nonprofit status is not subverted.

Cost shifting by providers resulting from the Republican Medicare and Medicaid
budget rollbacks will add more than $84 billion to private insurance bills
over the next seven years, Lewin-VHI estimates.

Dying in the hospital is often prolonged against patients' wishes, according
to a massive study sponsored by the R.  W.  Johnson Foundation.  A controlled
intervention aimed at improving communication of patients' preferences to
physicians was largely ineffective, researchers found.

Depression, because of its prevalence and impact, is the focus of a new,
AHCPR-sponsored Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT) project that will seek
to identify more effective approaches to treatment in primary care settings.

Fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid were not as big a political focus in
the legislation-making process as some expected.  Differences between the two
parties were largely rhetorical.  Republicans could not play tough on the
issue if they were also shrinking enforcement budgets.

Golden Rule Insurance Co.  earned a reputation for super-clout with its heavy
donations to Republican candidates, the friendship between chair Patrick
Rooney and Speaker Gingrich, and success in helping to place medical savings
accounts - which Golden Rule sells - high on the Republican agenda.

The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) shrugged off relentless
maligning while attempting to balance fiscal and program accountability
against the states' desire for quick and easy Medicaid managed care waivers.
Haste had made waste in large scale programs in Arizona and Tennessee.  But
waiver applicants like New York City chafed at delays and dreamed fondly of
block grants.

Jackson Hole WY became a vacation spot again.

Kaiser Permanente, losing market share, undertook restructuring and became a
target of California's feisty Health Care Workers' Local 250, whose 13,700
Kaiser workers rejected a 3-year wage freeze proposed by the archetype HMO.

MedPartners and Mullikin Medical Enterprises announced merger plans creating
the largest company yet in the booming physician practice management field,
with projected revenues of $1 billion in 1996.  Growth continued with the
merged giant's planned acquisition of Pacific Physician Services.

The federal Office of Technology Assessment was put out of business by
Congress.  Blue Cross and Blue Shield's Technology Evaluation Center stepped
in soon after to serve one former OTA client, the Civilian Health and Medical
Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS), under a long term contract.

Point-of-service (POS) health plans are the fastest-growing managed care
hybrids on the market.  While HMOs and PPOs each held a stable 25 percent
market share in 1993-1994, Foster Higgins reported that POS plans absorbed
most of the 10-point drop in indemnity coverage, climbing from 9 percent to 17
percent of the market.  HCFA worked overtime preparing new rules to allow POS
plans to enter the Medicare market, where they were expected to have
substantial appeal as a door-opener, or transitional product.

The Ryan White CARE Act received overwhelming support in the Senate's
five-year reauthorization vote on the program, which grants money to cities
and states for care for AIDS patients.

Strokes due to atrial fibrillation could be cut in half with proper
anti-coagulation therapy with warfarin, according to the AHCPR's stroke PORT.

Telemedicine experiments advanced in many rural areas.  Further development of
the fledgling technology will depend on the effects of deregulation of
telecommunications and the buildup of a multipurpose information
infrastructure that will allow costs to be spread among government, education,
and health users.

The tobacco industry stayed on the defensive, as internal memos discovered in
litigation characterized cigarettes as "nicotine delivery systems" and likened
nicotine to cocaine.  The AMA and the Clinton Administration kept up their
push for regulating tobacco as a drug.

The President's Vaccines for Children program was targeted for defunding by
Congress after being undercut by a government report that said outreach to
socially-isolated children was a bigger obstacle to immunization goals than
the cost of vaccines.

WellPoint Health Networks Inc.  and Health Systems International Inc.  dropped
plans for what would have been the biggest HMO merger ever, after a long
wrangle.  Power-sharing by CEOs Leonard Schaeffer and Malik Hasan appeared to
be a major hangup.

Medicine & Health's 8th Annual Health People of the Year Awards


Winner:  Newt Gingrich

The Speaker of the House displayed disarming naivete when he blithely asserted
to the AMA House of Delegates in December that after physicians set up PSOs,
"you're going to be able to offer dramatically better services at lower costs.
Within a very short time the customer's going to figure out where to go, and
at that point you're going to see a very dramatic drop in the profit margin of
the insurance company."

But Gingrich was nothing short of brilliant in marshalling his assets and
neutralizing his opposition during the crafting of the Republican Medicare and
Medicaid legislation.  Squabbling among stakeholders helped paralyze reform
the previous year.  Gingrich refused to let it happen again.  The Speaker made
time for meetings over details with the trade and consumer lobbies.  He coaxed
and cajoled the American Association of Retired Persons and the American
Hospital Association out of frontal resistance.  He wooed the American Medical
Association with the promise of freedom to run their own managed care plans
and reap the rewards.

Revolutionaries don't often take the AMA by storm.  We think Gingrich probably
overstates the promise of the free market, and that his rhetoric and ideology
get in the way of smart health policy.  But in 1995, Newt Gingrich set the
agenda.

Runner-up:  Nancy Kassebaum

The retiring icon of incrementalism from Kansas might have been our winner in
many other years.  Few can match the scope and persistence of her efforts to
make the system work better.  She engineered a message vote in the Senate on
the Ryan White CARE Act; worked unstintingly on Food and Drug Administration
reform; co-sponsored action on drive-through deliveries; labored patiently on
incremental insurance reforms; and even held a Senate committee overtime to
conduct an impromptu civics lesson for a group of students after wrapping up
action on national organ transplantation legislation.

Sen.  Kassebaum has been one of the anchors of a group of moderate Republicans
in the Senate who stopped attempts to completely dismantle the Medicaid
program and represent the voice of reason in current budget negotiations.  She
will be missed.
