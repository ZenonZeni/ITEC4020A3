<H4>* Two states, Louisiana and Maine, have enacted legislation on two different occasions which recognize marijuana's therapeutic utility.  Louisiana originally enacted legislation in May 1978 which called for a state program of legal access for victims of cancer and glaucoma.  In July 1991 this law was amended to included victims of paralysis.  In Maine, the legislature first enacted a bill in August 1979 which was similar to that of New Mexico.  In 1992, the Maine legislature enacted a bill which allowed for cultivation of a small amount of marijuana for medical purposes.  This bill was vetoed by the govemor and the legislature failed to override the veto.  It has been reported to the Alliance that Alaska passed legislation in the early 1980s recognizing marijuana's medical value.  ACT is unable to provide further details on this legislation.</H4>
