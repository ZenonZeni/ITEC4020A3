<P><BR><BR>

The health care benefit dilemma of the 1990s:  At the very time employers are being squeezed on all sides to reduce costs, there's a growing demand on the part of employees to maintain - in fact, increase - their health care options.<P>

Health care benefits can be expensive.  On average, medical costs have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation in recent years.  In response, some businesses have reduced benefits or gone to more restrictive plans. The risk is that this can hurt morale and in turn negatively impact productivity.<P>

The real question:  How can you control your company's health care costs without sacrificing plan benefits and flexibility?<P>

The real answer:  A NYLCare managed health care plan that can "blend" the features of an HMO or other managed care plans with traditional health insurance.  The result can be a cost effective package, which combines the advantages of both types of coverages.<P>

What does a managed care plan look like?  That depends totally and completely on your company's needs.  NYLCare, which works with more than 16,000 employer groups nationwide, offers a full spectrum of health plan designs:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
			<LI>Managed Indemnity
			<LI>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)
			<LI>Multi-Option
			<LI>Point-of-Service (POS)
			<LI>HMO
</UL>

Definitions of these different health care arrangements can be found in the <A HREF="mcgl.html">Health Care Terms Glossary</A>. <P>

The options are nearly unlimited.  Under a multi-option plan, for example, a variety of different plans can be combined, such as a PPO plan and an HMO or an HMO with a POS plan. <P>

The advantages of adopting a managed care plan through NYLCare include:<P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Built-in plan design flexibility: The plan you implement will be designed and tailored to reflect the unique benefit needs of your business. You can also select the type of plan and amount of benefits your employees will receive. <P>

	<LI>Cost controls and predictability: A plan will be designed that is affordable and, just as important, enables you to budget and manage your health care costs.<P>

	<LI>NYLCare will work with your business to help keep your health care costs predictable and, therefore, manageable.  With a managed care option from NYLCare, for instance, you can select the option that is best suited to your budget. <P>

	<LI>Options for enhanced benefits.  Key employees can often afford to purchase higher benefits for themselves and their families.  Many business owners find that obtaining quality, affordable health care benefits for themselves and their families can be difficult.  However, a NYLCare managed care plan can help meet your family's individual health care needs and it can do so on a tax-deductible basis.<P>

	<LI>Options for employee choice, which can have a positive affect on labor relations.
