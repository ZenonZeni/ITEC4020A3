<A NAME="Channel"</A><P><H1>Conscious Channeling</H1>
 <H3> by Mary Lynn</H3>

<BR><FONT SIZE= 4>
You can (and do) channel for yourself and others. You need not be famous, write a book, or go into a trance. You can access/connect with all the energy and information you need with conscious channeling.<BR><BR>

<B>What is Channeling?</B>

<BR>To channel is to be a conduit to receive and express energy as it moves from one dimension to another—and that expression takes many forms. A bodyworker is being a channel for healing energy to express/pass through the hands. An artist is being a channel for a vision to express on canvas, clay, etc. A poet is being a channel for thoughts to express in word rhythms and forms. A musician is being a channel for sound to express through instruments.	

<BR><BR>You are being a channel every moment of every day…in one form or another. You are an instrument: through your hands; through your eyes; through your thoughts; through your voice; through your heart--however you choose to communicate the energy you have received.	

<BR><BR>The question is: Are you conscious of the energy that you have connected with and you are expressing in every deed, word and thought? Are you consciously aware of the energy that is flowing to you and through you and expressing to All That Is around you?	

<BR><BR><B>Channel with Voice Expression</B>

<BR>The most common reference to "channeling" is with voice expression. It means verbally expressing the forms of telepathic communication that you receive while in a state of Love and Peace. Conscious Channeling means describing verbally the symbols and pictures that you may be seeing, and sharing verbally the thoughts that come to you as you connect with Divine Energies. You may want to refer to them as Cosmic, God, Source, Universal or Higher Energies. The "high" aspect refers to a frequency or vibration, a vastness of consciousness, and a level of responsibility rather than a judgment of worthiness.	


<BR><BR>The messages you receive while in a state of Love may come in a purposeful channeling session, or you may already be aware of receiving guidance/messages all through your day--as long as you remain in a state of Love. When we move into fear we jam our circuits; our clarity seems to vanish. The clarity and the help from other realms is always there, if we keep our channels open.<BR><BR>

<B>You as a Conscious Channel</B>

<BR>You, as a conscious channel, are aware in the moment of what is being transmitted/coming through/being spoken. There is no trance involved. You are conscious of what is happening and are in a relaxed, meditative, attuned state that enables connection. You don't have to do anything except get out of the way with your conscious mind. 	

<BR><BR>Getting out of the way is a continuing spiritual practice. My experience is that the Divine Energies are totally compassionate, non-judgmental, patient and loving. If there is a judgment/attitude then you are getting in the way.	

<BR><BR>As a conscious channel you speak with your own voice, although you may sound a bit different than usual because of the resonance of the Energy in your voice (usually very calm and filled with Love). As a conscious channel you speak in your own words, and receive and express thoughts that are in alignment with your deepest beliefs--because the energies you channel in a state of Love are aligned with your Full Multi-dimensional/Soul/Higher/External Self. And, yes, you may channel your Higher Self. Hopefully, you do that every day!

<BR><BR><B>We All Channel</B>
<BR>I believe that we all receive guidance (channel) all the time. The question is whether we are open to receive it, trust it and act on it in our everyday lives, in order to live in alignment with Spirit. Channeling is very empowering because you are consistently encouraged to trust your Self in the process--to trust your feelings, your vision, your thoughts, your discernment, and to trust the flow of the Universe even if you don't understand it in the moment.	

<BR><BR>Channeling is a way of opening your Heart. Most of us have never felt so much Love. As you expand and ascend to higher frequencies of connection, your consciousness will transform so that you have the eyes to See and the ears to Hear the energetic dimensions of your Self and the Universe.

<A NAME="Dreams"</A><P><H1>Dreams and Meditation: Your Freeway to Enlightenment</H1>
 <H3> by Betty Bethards</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE= 4>

Dreams are your greatest free tools for insight and self-understanding. Throughout mankind's history, dreams have been an important source of guidance, inspiration, prophecy, prediction and problem solving. In every culture, we find some version of "sleeping on a problem" before making a decision. What is this wonderful dimension that is so near and yet so far from our reach?	

<BR><BR>First we need to realize that we are spending 10 days out of every month in the dream state. That's a third of your life that you're missing if you're not working with your dreams. We all leave the body every night of our life to go out and be taught and trained. We are given valuable lessons and insights into our daily life by our higher self and team of teachers, whose sole purpose is to help guide us in our self-growth here on the earth plane. Our dreams give us positive messages about our life direction and show us what needs to be changed in order to create rich and fulfilling lives.

<BR><BR>Besides receiving important information about our daily activities, dreams can also be a tremendous source of inspiration for art, music, writing and other creative endeavors. You can learn to program yourself to have a dream about a specific problem or project by sitting on the side  of the bed before going to sleep and saying:

<BR><BR><B>1)  I will have a dream about (the problem) tonight.
<BR>2) I will remember the dream.
<BR>3) I will wake up and write the dream down.</B>	

<BR><BR>The mind is a very powerful tool like a computer. Whatever you program into it, is what you receive. Be sure and keep a pad of paper and a pen by your bedside. Write the dream down immediately after you have it or talk it into a tape recorder. If you wait until morning, you are more likely to forget the dream.	
<BR><BR>Your best dreams (or what I call "teaching" dreams) occur between 3:00 and 5:00 am, or happen just before awakening. The dreams that occur when you first go to bed are usually Just clearing out the day's mental clutter and can be affected by what you ate, read or just watched on television.

<BR><BR><B>Common Types of Dreams</B>
<BR>Nothing is off limits in the dream state. We are open to experiencing all levels of self: all fears, frustrations, suppressed images, visionary insights and unknown territory. We will become more comfortable with all dream images when we learn to welcome them (whatever they are) as symbolic messengers of self.
<BR><BR><B>Nightmares</B>
<BR>Often times you will be given a nightmare to call your attention to a problem. Where pleasant dreams may be forgotten easily, a nightmare can scare you into remembering the dream. Nightmares show us our fears that have been blown way out of proportion, or something that is affecting us negatively.

<BR><BR><B>Disaster Dreams</B>
<BR>Whether an earthquake, flood, fire or tidal wave, a disaster indicates a sudden change in some area of your life. A flood means an emotional upheaval and an earthquake means a big rearrangement in your affairs. Disaster dreams usually indicate turning points or opportunities to take advantage of a new direction.

<BR><BR><B>Sexual Dreams</B>
<BR>When making lobe in a dream, this represents a merger of your own masculine and feminine energies. We are all working to balance the male and female polarities within our being. The feminine energy is our sensitive, intuitive, creative side while the masculine is our strong, assertive side. Sex in a dream can also mean that you are integrating the qualities you associate with that person within your being.

<BR><BR><B>Flying Dreams</B>
<BR>Flying dreams are great fun and usually mean you are consciously out of the body. You are free to explore anywhere you like. If you are flying around and start to lose altitude, it simply suggests that you have a fear of exploring higher dimensions and breaking out of limits.

<BR><BR><B>Direction Dreams</B>
<BR>The direction in which you are traveling indicates whether you are on the right track in your life situation now. If you are going up in a dream (up a mountain, up a road, ladder, staircase, elevator, etc.) you are going in the right direction. If you are going up and down, such as on a roller-coaster, it means your energy is scattered and needs to get centered.

<BR><BR><B>Dream Symbols</B>
<BR>Our dreams are all in symbols and once you understand the positive meaning behind the symbols, you will find that they are easy to work with and interpret. A good place to begin is to realize that everyone and everything in the dream represents a part of you. You are the producer, writer, actor and director of your life story.	

<BR><BR>Male and female figures represent your own masculine and feminine energies. A child represents your child part; an aged person an old part of self (either one that is wise or a part that is dying because you have outgrown it). The colors, numbers, animals, scenery, clothes and letters are also significant.	

<BR><BR>After a routine of regular practice interpreting the symbols, your new skill becomes a natural, flowing easy part of your life. I tested the symbols in<I> The Dream Book: Symbols for Self-Understanding</I> with audiences for 15 years, and they have been hitting right on with people throughout the world.

<BR><BR><B>Meditation and Self-Growth</B>
<BR>Meditation is the key tool I teach in helping people to center their energy and to get a recall on their dreams. Meditation helps us to develop a growing sense of serenity and self-awareness. By sitting in the silence for 20 minutes a day, you achieve a deep relaxation of body, mind and spirit. You begin to see how you set up your life experiences and the lessons of each situation.	

<BR><BR>All forms of meditation are good, but in our high speed society, it's important to protect our energy by closing down at the end. I have given out this mediation technique throughout the world for the last 25 years.	

<BR><BR>The easiest and most enjoyable way to meditate is to listen to your favorite songs and music for the full 20 minutes. While sitting with your spine erect, you’re aligning your energy to the God force. This 20 minute period, however, is not our only meditation practice. We endeavor to practice the meditation attitude in watching our thoughts and behavior throughout the day, and working with our dreams at night. You will begin to see how your thoughts, words and actions set up your reality and life experiences. You will also discover the many gifts, talents and abilities within you as you explore the inner self. You can learn to create a reality that works for you!<BR><BR>

<A NAME="Psychic"</A><P><H1>What a Psychic Can Do for Your Health</H1>
 <H3> by Rev. Kerry Echo Kiefer</H3>
<IMG SRC="rbline.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE= 4>
<B>Putting a psychic first on your list of yearly check-ups can save time, money, undue fears and frustration.</B><BR><BR>	
Human beings tend innately toward wellness and balance. At the same time, we are always growing and changing--structurally reorganizing, making energetic shifts, and reestablishing--on all levels of our existence, seen and unseen. What we call "illness" is really only a side effect of such larger, holistic processes. Yet we feel poorly all the same, and worse when the "illness" resists treatment.	

<BR><BR>In cases of this kind, the "illness" itself is a symptom, so the cause must be sought elsewhere, in another, other-than-physical dimension of oneself. Otherwise, that of which we are unconscious and what our health practitioners cannot see can cost us a lot of time, money, worry and frustration. No, it is not time to change acupunturists, but it may be time to see a psychic.	

<BR><BR>Few people are as skilled as psychics at seeing the entire person--from past incarnations to parallel lives and everything in between. In psychic jargon, a person is a "book," and good books are multidimensional: growing, changing and developing on many levels. Health problems for these sensitive, interesting people are a sign of growth, and to gain some perspective on their "illness" comes as quite a relief and speeds recovery.	

<BR><BR>Diane thought she had a run-of-the-mill yeast infection. She treated herself with a home remedy she had used successfully for years. When to her surprise it failed to work, she visited her homeopathic physician, whose remedy she used until it was clear that it was not working either. She proceeded to the herbalist and the acupuncturist. Diane still have the yeast infection when she turned to a psychic 4 months later.	

<BR><BR>Looking clairvoyantly at the problem, the psychic could see that though Diane was troubled by the infection and afraid of something more serious, she was experiencing another agitation just beneath her conscious awareness. A closer look revealed that memories of her ex-husband and their marriage, which had been held in her lower abdomen for many years, were being released and leaving her body.	

<BR><BR>Diane had placed great store in this marriage. Her prospective husband was bright, sensitive, and had a solid career ahead of him. She anticipated a marriage as intellectually stimulating and emotionally satisfying as their courtship had been. Once married, however, her spouse became stubbornly absorbed in his work. The marriage became an after-thought, generally an outright annoyance when he was faced with shared responsibilities. In vain, Diane nursed the marriage along, absorbing her husband's irritation and suppressing her own pain and disappointment. She held these energies in the most vulnerable part of her body, the womb, where women protect and nurture hopes, dreams and physical children.	

<BR><BR>From a psychic point of view, Diane was in great spiritual health. Despite her long discomfort, she had actually been in the midst of healing herself. She had begun that process with the decision to remarry, and the yeast infection appeared soon after. She was clearing her body, preparing herself for a new partner. In the grander design, she was re-integrating her past experience in order to create the harmonious life and relationship she envisioned.	

<BR><BR>Diane's greatest fear was allayed: there was nothing wrong with her general physical health. The yeast infection would clear up, and all the sooner, now that she had help in bringing an old problem into full consciousness. Within a week of her psychic consultation, the yeast infection disappeared. Still, Diane's case does not mean that psychic consultations can (or should) replace other alternative healing methods and practitioners. Far from it.	

<BR><BR>James' situation is a case in point. James fell backward off a roof ladder 17 years ago. He was rushed to an emergency room and remained hospitalized for months while medical doctors worked to relieve severe pain and restore mobility. James the hospital confined indefinitely to a wheelchair, and with little hope of ever walking again, or of having much range of motion in any part of his body.	

<BR><BR>James had always been a religious man. Now, in a state of enforced inactivity, he took a deeply spiritual turn. Along with a variety of medicines and physical therapy, prayer and meditation became part of his daily regimen. Indeed, before long James decided to make a gradual attempt to dispense with all medication. He was convinced that his answers lay with his growing faith. In addition, at quite some expense he began seeing a well-known spiritual healer.	
<BR><BR>James had been seeing the spiritual healer for several years when he made an appointment with a local psychic. There was something wrong with his faith, he claimed. He could no longer afford the spiritual healing; and, worse, once he left the healer's office, he could not replicate the miracle of having walked several paces.	

<BR><BR>Seldom does a psychic have the pleasure of sitting before someone with no spiritual problems, but that was basically the case with James. His difficulty was not spiritual at all. There was no breach of faith of any kind on his part. Rather, he suffered from a delusion that all physical disease could be corrected by spiritual means. Of course, the well-known healer could cause him to walk, and there was no guile in this. But, not being clairvoyant, the healer missed the mark with James altogether. He could not see that James' healing would come by a different approach; one which acknowledged the spiritual sanctity of the body.	

<BR><BR>Interestingly, a psychic scan of James' physical body revealed no organic damage or blockage. It was a body that seemed merely to have lacked the benefit of flowing energy for many years. Though this was serious enough, it bode well for the prospect of James eventually learning to walk again. Curious about what the medical diagnosis had been 17 years ago, the psychic asked the nurse attending James, who replied, "Compression."	

<BR><BR>"You mean to say, from a medical point of view, James did not sustain any major damage to his spinal cord? That is all they said it was, <I>Compression?</I>" The diagnosis validated the psychic's reading, but it was surprising all the same, because no one had questioned it at the time. The course of James' life might have been different had alternative treatments been more widely accepted. Nevertheless, James' reality conformed to his beliefs and conspired with them to create a long, difficult lesson.	

<BR><BR>The psychic's prediction was that James would walk again, but it would take at least two years of intense, structural bodywork and a lot of patience on James' part. The miracle of walking again would not occur overnight, but it was no less a miracle for that. James was referred immediately to a Rolfer, who restored 80% of his range of motion in 6 months. James is now seeing a highly-skilled chiropractor who is working to strengthen his ambulatory spine. Though only a year has passed, James's progress is good. The prognosis for his recovery remains consistent with that of the psychic.	

<BR><BR>Like Diane and James, there are many people who find themselves in need of the kind of clarity and validation that only a psychic can give. We are fortunate that alternatives to allopathic medicine have survived, and are available to us today. We are also fortunate o have a new model of cooperation among health practitioners, including medical doctors, which ensures that client care comes first. It is now possible to use the help of a psychic in conjunction with other healing practitioners. Better yet, put one at the top of your list of yearly check-ups, and see your psychic first.	

<BR><BR>Since there is a wide variety of psychics in the marketplace, be sure to ask for one who specializes in health readings and who is willing to make referrals to other alternative practitioners. Also, inquire about the psychic's professional background, training and credentials, just as you would of anyone else who is offering a service.<BR><BR>
