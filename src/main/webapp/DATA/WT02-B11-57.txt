<b><hr>In Denmark, education is compulsory for children between seven and sixteen years of age. About 90% of all children attend the public education system, the ‘Folkeskole’, which provides pupils with primary and lower secondary education, usually in mixed ability groups who often stay together for the entire nine years. About 45% of the pupils stay on for an optional tenth year.<br>
Nearly all school-leavers continue in upper secondary education: about 50% in vocational schools (technical or commercial) and 45% in schools providing general upper secondary education. About 5% leave or drop out of the education system after the Folkeskole.<hr></b><br>
<br>

<b>The ‘Gymnasium’ and ‘HF’<br></b>
There are two forms of general (i.e. non-vocational) upper secondary education in Denmark: the ‘gymnasium’ and the higher preparatory examination courses, the ‘HF’. Institutions may offer both courses either in a package or as single subjects.<br>
The county councils are responsible for the financial administration of general secondary institutions,  of which 85% are publicly owned. A dozen schools take boarders.<br>
The national examination system is administered by the Ministry of Education which is also responsible for the content and for monitoring the quality of the education.<br>
<br>
<b>The ‘Gymnasium’<br></b>
The ‘gymnasium’ is a three-year course leading to the Upper Secondary School Leaving Examination (‘studentereksamen’), which qualifies  for admission to university and other higher education studies. The aim of the ‘gymnasium’ is to provide  general education as well as to prepare the students for continued studies. There are approximately 150 ‘gymnasiums’ in Denmark. About twenty are private independent institutions financed by the state with up to 80-85% of their  budgets.<br>
<br>
<b>Admission</b> <br>
To be admitted to the ‘gymnasium’, a pupil must have completed nine years of basic education with English from year four and a second foreign language from year seven (German or French). The pupil’s basic school of origin must declare the applicant qualified for the ‘gymnasium’ , and applicants must have taken the Leaving Examination of the ‘Folkeskole’ with satisfactory results.<br>
<br>
<b>The Subjects <br></b>
The ‘gymnasium’ is divided into two lines: the languages line and the mathematics line. The two lines have a common core of obligatory subjects as well as subjects that are distinctive to each line. Some of the optional subjects are available at two levels: intermediate level and high level. A core of basic subjects must be offered at all schools; optional subjects vary from school to school. At least two of the subjects studied by a student must be at the high level, and all students must write a major assignment.<br>
<br>
<b>Examinations <br></b>
After the third year, all students take a written examination in Danish and in the subjects chosen at the high level. The number of oral examinations varies in accordance with the range of subjects chosen. A total of ten examinations must be taken in order to pass the complete examination, of which up to three may be taken after the first and second years.<br>
<br>
<b>Higher Preparatory Examination (‘HF’)<br></b>

The Higher Preparatory Examination (Danish abbreviation:‘HF’) was introduced at the end of the 1960s and is above all directed at young people and adults who have left the education system and wish to return. It is also possible for pupils to attend an ‘HF’-course directly after the 10th year of the Folkeskole.<br>
Like the ‘gymnasium’, the  HF- courses offer general education as well as prepare the students for continued studies. A full-time student may complete the course in two years, but for adults the examination can also be taken on a single-subject basis or as a combination of subjects to form a complete examination over a longer period of time.<br>
Single subjects or even a complete ‘HF’-examination may be taken on a private basis. Such students are offered two lessons of examination guidance per subject.<br>
There are about 145 institutions offering the Higher Preparatory Examination course in Denmark. 65 of them are attached to ‘gymnasiums’ offering mainly full-time two-year courses. About 75 adult education centres offer ‘HF’ mainly as single subjects. As a parallel activity, these centres provide general education at a more basic level for adults.<br>
<br>
<b>Admission <br></b>
In order to be admitted to a higher preparatory examination course in one or more subjects, the student must have finished lower secondary education at least one year before admission to the course and be accepted by the ‘HF’-institution as qualified.<br>
Students wishing to be admitted directly from the basic school to a two year course must have completed ten years of basic school and must be considered qualified by their schools of origin.<br>
<br>
<b>The Subjects<br></b>
‘HF’-subjects are comparable to ‘gymnasium’-subjects as to level, but differ somewhat in content. A number of optional subjects, however, are identical in both types of education. Some of the ‘HF’-subjects may be chosen at two levels, and in some subjects there is a possibility of taking the examination at a level corresponding to the high level of the equivalent ‘gymnasium’-subject.<br>
<br>
<b>Examination <br></b>
A complete higher preparatory examination consists of a cluster of common core subjects, three optional subjects and a major written assignment. Students may choose to take the optional subjects at either intermediate level or high level. An important difference from the ‘gymnasium’ is that a complete higher preparatory examination requires an oral and/or a written examination in each subject studied.<br>
Like the‘studentereksamen’, the ‘HF’ qualifies for admission to higher education, although specific optional subjects or a specific level of attainment may be required.<br>
<b>Special Features<br></b>
<br>
<b>Major Written Assignment <br></b>
Students in the ‘gymnasium’ as well as students wanting to take a complete Higher Preparatory Examination must submit a major written assignment on a subject chosen by the student. The assignment is written in one week, which is free of lessons. It is assessed by the teacher and an external examiner, and the mark is part of the overall examination result.<br>
<br>
<b>Student Influence <br></b>
Students’ councils are statutory, and decisions about the form and content of the teaching are made jointly by teacher and students. The students also have a say in the choice of examination syllabus.<br>
<br>
<b>Student Counselling <br></b>
Every institution offering upper secondary education has a  number of counsellors appointed locally among teachers, who have been specially trained. A third of their working time is devoted to counselling: career guidance as well as general pastoral care.<br>
<br>
<b>Grants and Loans <br></b>
Students at a ‘gymnasium’ or ‘HF’-institution are eligible for financial support in the form of a State grant or loan. The kind and extent of the support is based on the applicants’ age and their own or, in some cases their parents’,  financial circumstances. To obtain a grant or loan, the applicant must be a Danish citizen. However, in certain circumstances, students from other countries may receive support according to the rules applying to Danish citizens.<br>
<br>
<b>National Administration of Examinations <br></b>
All material offered at the examination must be approved by the ministry. The ministry draws up the written examination papers and appoints<br>
external examiners for the oral and written examinations. Examination papers are assessed by two external examiners.<br>
Each year, the ministry decides on the subjects in which the students in the ‘gymnasium’ shall be orally examined. The higher preparatory examination is always taken in all subjects.<br>
By fulfilling the attendance requirements candidates at both examinations obtain the right to be examined in a limited part of the syllabus.<br>
<br>
<b>Examination Averages <br></b>
Marks are given on a scale from 0 to 13. The final result of a ‘studentereksamen’ includes the marks gained in the examination as well as the marks given by the teacher at the end of the course.<br>
In order to pass, the student must obtain a minimum average of 6.0, both in the year’s work and in the examination.<br>
In the ‘gymnasium’,  the student’s progress is continually assessed and term marks are given twice a year.<br>
No marks are given at the higher preparatory examination courses. The examination average is based solely on the marks gained at the examination.<br>
<br>
<b>Teacher Qualifications <br></b>
To obtain permanent appointment at a ‘gymnasium’ or an HF-institution, a teacher must be a university graduate at what corresponds to M.A. or M.Sc. level, and he or she must have taken an additional course in educational theory and practice.<br>
<br>
<b>School Management <br></b>
Each school has a headteacher, who is accountable to the county council, the school governors and the Ministry of Education. Otherwise schools are run on a non-hierarchical basis with a very limited number of assistants to the head and no other middle management. Teachers’ councils are statutory, and teachers as well as students take an active part in the decision-making at all levels.<br>
<br>
<b>School Governors <br></b>
At all public ‘gymnasiums’ and higher preparatory examination institutions, a board of governors must be elected. The board consists of student, teacher and staff - and in  the case of the ‘gymnasium’ of parent-representatives. The county council is also represented on the board. It is also possible to coopt, for example, representatives from trade and industry on to the school board. <br>
Within the provisions of the law and the overall local county council education budget, the board fixes the school budget, decides on the size of classes and makes decisions about the subjects to be offered by the school. The board has no say in the appointment of personnel: this is the responsibility of the headteacher, whose nominations are then formally endorsed by the county council.<br>
<br>
<b>The School Year <br></b>
The school year is 35-36 weeks, excluding the examination period.<br>
