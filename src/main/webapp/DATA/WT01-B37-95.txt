<h2>Chapter Ten: Environmental Issues and the Legalization of
Drugs </h2>

<hr>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>

<p><b>I. Their Argument</b> </p>

<p>Some extremists in the drug legalization debate suggest that
we should legalize hemp - the plant from which we get marijuana -
because hemp could be used as fiber to make clothing,
alternatives to lumber, paper products, and the like. </p>

<p><b>II. Our Argument</b> </p>

<p>Some of the arguments of the legalizers are at least plausible
(plausible, but wrong). This is not one of them. The argument
that we should grow hemp for fiber is completely absurd. First,
if hemp is such a good all-purpose fiber, why isn't any country
in the world seriously growing it? Second, there was a time in
the U.S. when it was legal to grow hemp (before 1937), and no one
did. By 1937, so few people chose to grow hemp that it wasn't
even mentioned in Department of Agriculture or Department of
Commerce reports.154 If it is such a good idea, why didn't anyone
do it when they could have? </p>

<p>Finally, assume (although this assumption is contradicted by
history) that hemp could provide all of the environmental
benefits that the legalizers claim. These benefits would still
have to be weighed against the costs of allowing farmers to grow
thousands, if not millions, of acres of marijuana. It would be
impossible to have a policy that allowed the legal sale of hemp
for fiber but not for smoking, for one simply could not enforce
it. (By comparison, think of how plausible a policy would be that
said farmers could grow wheat to make bread but not to make
biscuits). Thus, in order to get the supposed benefits of
&quot;hemp as fiber,&quot; you would also have to allow people to
use it as marijuana. But when we recall all of the harms
associated with marijuana use - medical problems, lost
productivity, increased accidents, increased crime, etc. - we
find that <i>even granting </i>the supposed benefits of
&quot;hemp as fiber,&quot; these benefits are still outweighed by
the negative consequences of such a policy. </p>

<p>Thus, the &quot;hemp as fiber&quot; argument is disproved by
both history and the fact that no other countries are seriously
considering it as an option. But even granting the legalizers
arguments here, the costs of such a policy still would clearly
outweigh the benefits. </p>

<p>154 For proof of this fact the reader is invited to scan any
Agriculture or Commerce reports from 1916 to 1937. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>It
they say...</b> </p>

<p>We should grow hemp and use it as fiber, thus achieving
environmental benefits. </p>

<p><img src="golddot1.gif" align="bottom" width="22" height="22"><b>Then
you say...</b> </p>

<p>When farmers could do this in the early twentieth century in
the U.S., no one did. [Reports of the Departments of Agriculture
and Commerce, 1916-1937.] </p>

<p>If it is such a good idea, why aren't any other countries in
the world doing it now? </p>

<p>Even if we granted the supposed benefits of &quot;hemp as
fiber,&quot; (which we should not), the costs of such a program
would still clearly outweigh the benefits. <br>
