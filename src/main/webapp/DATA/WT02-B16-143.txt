<p><font size=2><b>Regional Environmental Education Grants Program - EPA</b> -- New England received 125 applications for grants ranging from $5,000 to 
$25,000 during the 1995 education grants program. Twenty-six environmental organizations were awarded a total of $181,166 for environmental 
education projects. Additionally, EPA Headquarters awarded over $230,000 in grants to two local environmental organizations to fund 
environmental education projects throughout New England. <br>
In addition to its annual grants program guidance, the regional office provides an information bulletin entitled &quot;How to put together a 
Competitive Environmental Education Proposal.&quot; EPA also offers a publication entitled &quot;Grant Funding for Your Environmental Education 
Program,&quot; prepared in conjunction with the North American Alliance for Environmental Education. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Paul G. Keough Earth Artists Program</b> -- Approximately 1,000 teachers of grades K-6 students participated in the 23rd annual poem and 
poster contest which is the largest contest of its kind in the country. Award ceremonies were held in each New England state throughout May and 
early June. Massachusetts' ceremony was the largest and was attended by over 1,700 children, parents and teachers. The entry deadline for the 
annual program is mid-March. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>President's Environmental Youth Awards (PEYA) Program</b> -- This national program encourages individuals, classes, schools, summer 
camps, and youth groups to promote local environmental awareness and community involvement. Last year's winner, a fifth grade class from the 
Zippel Elementary School in Presque Isle, Maine, formed the Zippel Energy Group to raise community awareness of environmental concerns. 
They created the Eagle Energy Patrol, a roving group of earth-friendly do-gooders who monitor the energy conservation habits of teachers, 
friends, and families and encouraged them to reduce, reuse and recycle. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Teacher Training Workshops</b> -- To enable New England teachers to feel comfortable with their command of environmental issues the region 
periodically co-sponsors workshops on various environmental topics such as indoor pollutants, air quality and wetlands. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Women in Science and Engineering (WISE)</b> -- The Region's WISE members collaborate with Boston area Girl Scout leaders to host 
environmental badge workshops and participate in regional science and career fairs throughout the school year. Their mission includes fostering 
an interest among girls in science and engineering. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Speaker's Bureau</b> -- The Environmental Education Division receives several requests each week for speakers and other participants in 
conferences and fairs sponsored by schools, organizations, and private companies. Nearly 100 regional employees with a variety of subject 
matter expertise volunteer to fill such requests. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Adopt-A-School Program</b> -- Dozens of EPA employees work with teachers and give presentations in classrooms. Their efforts focus around 
Earth Day, but several work with classes throughout the school year. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Library Services</b> -- EPA's Regional Library is one of 28 in the EPA Library Network. It houses technical and law collections including more 
than 10,000 microfiche reports and 130 journal titles on a variety of environmental topics. In addition, it maintains a collection of nontechnical 
publications indexed in its Public Information Collection, along with videotapes and reference copies on environmental teaching materials. 
Members of the public may use the Region I Library at EPA's One Congress Street, Boston location, Monday - Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 
4:30 p.m. (except federal holidays) or phone (617) 565-3300. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Adopt-A-Wetland Program</b> -- This two-part education project, geared for middle schools, consists of videos for students and teachers and a 
guidebook of activities for teachers. This unique hands-on program teaches children about wetlands ecology and how they can make a difference 
by protecting an area in their own community through stewardship activities conducted with their classes. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Junior Environmental Training (JET) Program</b> -- This outreach program, run by EPA's Environmental Services Division, involves staff 
members who travel periodically to area schools to perform a skit about Superfund cleanups and to discuss household hazardous waste. Hundreds 
of students in grades 1-8 participated in this program during the past school year. </font></p>
<p><font size=2><b>Youth in the Environment</b> -- The Region's Office of Civil Rights and Urban Affairs and its Water Division participate with other organizations 
to offer this program to eligible New England youth. Last summer, 70 inner-city youth were introduced to careers in the environmental field at 
eight locations throughout New England. They worked for 7-8 weeks learning about issues regarding solid waste management. In addition, they 
participated in weekly field trips and seminars on topics ranging from wastewater management to restoration ecology. This summer 60 
disadvantaged students are working at 10 wastewater treatment plants throughout New England. </font></p>
