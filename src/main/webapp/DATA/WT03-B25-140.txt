<BLOCKQUOTE>

Typical phosphate and chromate applications prepare metal for painting by modifying the metal with another inorganic coating. Conventional conversion coatings are applied to steel and zinc-coated steels to inhibit corrosion and provide an effective bond with paints, lacquers and other topcoats.<P>

Recent advances in pretreatment have been limited to conversion coatings contrived from solutions containing a minimum of three metal cations. In each of these solutions, the crystalline structure, morphology, density and composition produce an anchor-like barrier that promotes adhesion. Smaller, tighter conversion coatings provide the best adhesion and corrosion resistance.<P>

A new approach from Man-Gill Chemical Co., Cleveland, Ohio, involves preparing a metal surface for paint by bonding a reactive organic conversion coating, ROCC, to the metal substrate. The coating serves a dual function by creating a conversion coating on the metal substrate and by reacting with the organic topcoat. The result is a continuous film that prevents the oxygen migration that can occur under paint films, which can cause hydroxyl-induced corrosion, poor salt-fog resistance and lack of adhesion.<P>

This ultra-thin, functional organic coating has a molecular layer of 50 to 300 nanometers deep with a total coating weight of 30 to 60 mg per sq ft. The non-metal conversion coating produces a pleasing optical appearance that ranges from a uniform blue to purple.<P>

Reactive organic coatings are complex. They have proven to be an excellent pretreatment for steel and galvanized substrates. Work is in progress to evaluate their use on non-ferrous surfaces.<P>

The ROCC application process is adaptable to most pretreatment operations without any modifications. It can be applied by both spray and immersion.<P>

The product contains no heavy metals, is easily treated using conventional waste treatment, contains biodegradable organic components and results in reduced worker exposure to hazardous chemicals. <B>PF</B><P>
