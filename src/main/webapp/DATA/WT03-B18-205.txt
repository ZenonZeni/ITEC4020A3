<P>Understanding hydrogen retention is crucial to estimating the tritium
inventory in a fusion reactor and to predicting outgassing and recycling.
The retention of hydrogen isotopes in plasma-facing components is governed
by diffusion, trapping and desorption, with proper account taken of the role
of the incident plasma flux and ion bombarding energy. In PISCES-B experiments 
beryllium metallic samples were exposed to steady-state, high-flux deuterium
plasmas, and afterwards a set of thermal desorption experiments were carried
out on the beryllium samples. Importantly, these data show two deuterium
(D2) release peaks occuring at approximately 340 C. and 470 C. respectively.
We interpret this spectrum in terms of a surface component and a bulk
component. Analytical modeling of the diffusion data will be presented.
