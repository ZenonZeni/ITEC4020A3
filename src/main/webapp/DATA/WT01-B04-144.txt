<H3>Damaging effects of prenatal marijuana use show up in older children</H3>
<BR>
Subjects of this investigation by Fried P A, reporting on the effects of
marijuana used during pregnancy since 1978 (Life Sciences, 56:2159-2168,
1995) were primarily middle class, low-risk women who entered the study
in their early pregnancy. The offspring have been assessed repeatedly during
the neonatal period and at least annually up unto the i age of 6. While
earlier reports of children to age 3 did not reveal an association between
defects associated with in utero exposure to marijuana (memory, language
development, visual perceptual functioning), later follow-up could distinguish
between marijuana exposed children and control children.<BR>
<BR>
Prenatal marijuana exposure showed that at age 4 and older children showed
increased behavioral problems and decreased performance on visual perceptual
tasks, language comprehension sustained attention and memory. The author
concluded that the nature and the timing of the appearance of these deficits
was consistent with the notion that prenatal marijuana exposure adversely
affected behavior that is goal-directed which includes planning, organized
search, and impulse control. These findings suggested to the author that
chronic marijuana use impacted on functioning of the prefrontal lobe in
the brain.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>This study documents that the adverse effects of prenatal
exposure may not become apparent until the child grows old enough to perform
high level tests such as those termed executive functioning. The danger
of drawing short-term conclusions from effects that, while introduced in
utero may take a generation to discover, have been amply documented for
other poisons ingested by expectant mothers such as lead, cocaine, and alcohol.
Some authors have suggested that differences in the functioning of children
exposed in utero to marijuana to nonexposed children often disappear by
age 2-3. However, effects of marijuana cannot be determined until enough
time has passed so that the children are expected to perform. Then, and
only then, can their performance be accurately assessed. This prospective
study provides valuable insights into the many insidious problems associated
with the use of marijuana. <BR>
<H3>Prenatal use of tobacco and marijuana by adolescent mothers causes increased
damage to infants</H3>
<BR>
Cornelius et al. studied the effects of tobacco and marijuana use during
pregnancy on length of gestation, growth, and formation of 310 children
of adolescent mothers (Pediatrics 95:738-743). The subjects were interviewed
at mid-pregnancy and after delivery to obtain information on their use of
tobacco, marijuana, and other substances before and during pregnancy. The
infants were examined by physicians 24-36 hours after birth. The average
maternal age was 16.<BR>
<BR>
Prenatal tobacco use was associated with reduced birthweight, length, and
circumferences of head and chest, but not the gestational age or the number
of physical abnormalities of the baby. Prenatal marijuana smoking was associated
with increased premature birth. Additionally, some physical abnormalities
were associated with the use of marijuana during the first trimester among
the white participants in the study These effects of prenatal tobacco and
marijuana smoke were prominent despite the lower levels of exposure in these
offspring as compared with the offspring of mothers of adult age. The authors
concluded that the risk of adverse effects from use of tobacco or marijuana
during pregnancy may be increased for offspring of adolescent mothers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>Under the best of circumstances, infants of adolescent
mothers are 2-6 times more likely to be of low birthweight compared to infants
of adult women, and these infants are at increased risk for prematurity,
complications, and infant mortality. During the first year of life, the
mortality of children born to teenagers is 2-3 times that of infants born
to older mothers, and there is a 6-told increase of Sudden Infant Death
Syndrome, Hectman L. Teenage mothers and their children: risks and problems:
A review, Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, 34:569-575, 1989. The current
study points out that the use of tobacco or marijuana can be associated
with adverse effects on newborns. The authors found that adolescent mothers
who smoked tobacco during pregnancy were more likely to binge on alcohol
and use other illicit drugs in the first trimester. Mothers who smoked heavily
had significantly lower pre-pregnancy weight. Similarly, teenagers who used
marijuana tended to use more tobacco and drink more alcohol, particularly
in the crucial first trimester when the fetal organs are being formed. It
is clear that preventive efforts aimed at eliminating the use of marijuana
and tobacco would correlate with reduction of alcohol intake, further reducing
the risk of adverse effects to the children of these adolescent mothers.

<H3>Attention impaired by marijuana use</H3>
<BR>
If attention processes were impaired through chronic use of marijuana, this
would be important to understanding decreases in work performance, memory
learning, and every day tasks, such as driving. Previous research has shown
that cannabis use impairs attention while the user is intoxicated, but the
long-term effects of chronic use had not previously been studied. Subjects
in this study by Solowji et al (Biol Psychiatry, 37:731-739, 1995) were
recruited from the general community through advertising. The minimum requirement
for participation as a cannabis user was regular use at least once a month
for 3 years. By criteria established by the American Psychiatric Association,
all subjects could be labeled as cannabisdependent or cannabis abusers.
The control group of non-users were selected to cover the range of the age,
years of education, and sex distribution in the user group. The subjects
were excluded if they had a history of any psychiatric or neurologic disorders,
head injury, or the use of any other drugs more than once a month, or alcohol
abuse. The ability to focus attention and filter out irrelevant information
was measured and was found to be impaired progressively by the number of
years of marijuana use, but was unrelated to the frequency of use. With
increasing frequency of use the speed of information processing was delayed
significantly but was unaffected by the duration of use. The results suggested
that a chronic build-up of cannabinoid produces both short- and long-term
impairments of brain function compared to control subjects.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>The data from this well-done study provide an outstanding
demonstration that marijuana use effects brain function, and documents in
an objective way what has been observed for decades, namely that marijuana
produces an attention deficit. This study was controlled for alcohol use,
educational level, and l.Q. scores. No subject involved in other illicit
drug activity was included in the sample so that these data are from individuals
who consume marijuana by smoking alone. The data developed in this study
provide evidence that iincreasing duration of cannabis use leads to progressively
impaired information processing which could lead to distractibility and
impairment in any situation where concentration and focus attention are
essential. <BR>
<H3>Passive exposure to cocaine and marijuana impacts children</H3>
<BR>
In a study by Bhushan et al (American Journal of Public Health, 84:675-686,
1994) over 7,700 infants and young children visiting the pediatric emergency
room of a New York City hospital for six months in 1992 were screened for
evidence of byproducts of marijuana and cocaine in their urine. Of the approximately
15% who were given a routine urinalysis 245 were randomly selected for further
testing. The criteria recommended by NIDA for testing exposure to drugs
was applied in 100 of the cases and no metabolites were detected. However,
when more sensitive measures for cocaine and marijuana byproducts were used
to test the remaining 145 specimens, 11 % tested positive for cocaine or
marijuana metabolites. Since these children were all age 8 and under, the
most likely avenue of ingestion is by passive exposure to smoked forms of
the drugs. There is some indication that passive low level exposure may
be cumulative in children.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Commentary: </B>Low level exposures to toxins in the environment can
only be detected by changing the detection threshold to a highly sensitive,
but still specific level. This study shows that use of NIDA limits for exposure
would not have picked up the passive exposure of children whose mothers
use smoked marijuana and cocaine in their presence. Symptoms consistent
with cocaine toxicity have been described previously in infants and toddlers
exposed to smoke of cannabinoids and free base cocaine, by Moreland, et
al., Journal of Forensic Sciences 30:997-1002, 1985. Though these children
have no substance use problems themselves their exposure may predisposed
them to such problems in the future as well as other negative physiological
consequences. <BR>
