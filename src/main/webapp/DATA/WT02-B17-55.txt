Minutes of the Ninth meeting of the<br>
<H2>HYDROGEN TECHNICAL ADVISORY PANEL</H2>
<p><b>
April 1 - 2, 1996
<p>
Radisson Mark Plaza Hotel
5000 Seminary Road
Alexandria, Virginia
<p>
Monday, April 1, 1996<p>
Introduction - Patrick Takahashi</b><br>

Dr. Takahashi began the meeting by making suggestions for the future 
direction of the HTAP

including enhancing the partnership with the Department of Energy and 
reaching out into the 21st

century with an international world summit to take place perhaps in 
conjunction with the Fall 1997

HTAP meeting.   The symposium would consist of international 
governments, companies, and

academia who would come together to create partnerships and discuss 
ideas for the future.  A

parallel project would also be hosted for high school and college 
students. 
<p>
<b>Green Report Recommendations - James MacKenzie</b>

The Green Hydrogen Report discusses research and development, problems 
in transporting energy

supply, various areas where more research is needed and the need for 
demonstrations.  The Report

does not provide enough analysis or background to help the Department 
set research and analytical

priorities.  More specific guidelines are needed to set the focus and 
priorities, established in

cooperation with industry and staff.    A Hydrogen Energy Consortium, 
proposed in the Green

Hydrogen Report, needs to be better defined.  Year-by-year budget tables 
should be presented. 

HTAP is going to require more support from DOE staff to assist with the 
analysis of the various

programs, the rationale, funding levels, and competing priorities, in 
order to help the Department

better focus the program to achieve the goals that HTAP supports.  



The recommendation was made that the Strategic Directions Committee will 
integrate all of the

suggestions and develop an outline for the follow up report to the Green 
Hydrogen Report.
<p>
<b>The Role of HTAP - Alan Lloyd</b><br>
Dr. Lloyd began the discussion on the role of the panel by stating that 
one of the challenges that

HTAP faces is how to assist DOE in coming up with an expanded and 
technically defensible budget

request that will be successful in Congress.  Mr. Lynch recommended that 
HTAP make their position

on issues available as guidance within the government.  Mr. Nahmias 
suggested broad criteria be

laid out by HTAP as to the direction of the program.  Dr. Takahashi 
stated that HTAP needs to gain

the confidence of the entire system.  Mr. Rossmeissl suggested that HTAP 
find a way to work with

DOE on a regular basis on specific projects as individuals and keep the 
panel recommendations and

vision on a much broader scale.  Dr. Kamal stated that the panel needs 
to use their diversity to reach

a consensus on what advice they need to give to the Secretary.  Dr. 
Lloyd suggested that other

federal government agencies make presentations on their hydrogen 
programs to HTAP at future

meetings.
<p>
<b>Legislative Update - Kevin Aylesworth of Senator Harkin's 
Office</b><br>

There are three bills dealing with hydrogen being considered.  Senator 
Harkin and Congressman

Walker each introduced bills that are nearly identical.  The third bill, 
by Senator Burns, is

controversial in that it is a waste reduction project and does not have 
much to do with hydrogen. 

Congressman Walker has decide not to run for reelection, Senator Harkin 
is still interested in

hydrogen, and Domenici is gaining interest.  
<p>
<b>Federal Report - Russell Eaton</b><br>

There has been a reorganization in DOE and the Hydrogen Program is now 
in the Office of Solar

Thermal, Biomass Power and Hydrogen Technologies with Gary Burch as the 
director.  In putting

together the  97 budget for EERE, there was a push for near-term 
activities in deploying renewable

energy technologies.  The near-term activities in the hydrogen program 
were not as far along as the

deployment activities of renewable energy technologies.  As a result, 
the hydrogen program request

was reduced by approximately three and a half million over current 
funding.
<p>
<b>Five Year Implementation Plan - Catherine Gregoire Padr¢</b><br>

The basic outline for the report will consist of a program overview 
detailing program structure and

management coordination, technology transition strategy, the history of 
the program, the program

vision, the goals and a discussion on legislative drivers.  Also 
discussed will be the program within

DOE, the programs outside DOE, HTAP, and the role of NHA.  There will be 
discussion about the

coordination with the Hydrogen program of DOE-related and other 
federally-funded research and

also international cooperation and industry participation.  Technology 
development and validation

will follow up on last year s notice of interest.  Market 
transformations will include guidelines to move

to where we would like to be.  The plan will report the technical 
aspects of the program which

consists of production, storage, transport of hydrogen and utilization.  
A rough draft of the plan will

be sent to a few people for comments in May.
<p>
<b>DOE Hydrogen Program Overview - Neil Rossmeissl/JoAnn Milliken</b><br>


Mr. Rossmeissl showed a chart of the offices that have hydrogen 
technology associated with them

including solar, thermal, biomass, hydro technologies, and the Office of 
Industrial Technologies  Fuel

cell programs and fossil energy will both be active participants.  The 
program is organized into four

areas; production, storage, utilization and analysis.  The integration 
analysis group has be added on

the advisement of HTAP.  He suggested that HTAP members participate in 
the program at the peer

review. 


<p>In an overview of the Office of Transportation Technologies, Ms. 
Milliken described the structure in

OTT; fuels development, advanced automotive technologies, heavy vehicle 
technologies and the

office of Technology Utilization.  The fuel cell program is located 
under the advanced automotive
technologies office. The focus of the program is on proton exchange 
membrane fuel cells.  The

demonstration of a full-size power system is projected in 1998, a 
concept vehicle at the turn of the

century and production of a prototype vehicle around the year 2004.  The 
goal is fuel cell vehicles

having approximately 10 percent of the market in 2015 with 50 percent by 
the year 2050.
<p>
<b>Hydrogen Program Structure - Patrick Takahashi</b><br>

Dr. Takahashi stated that from the beginning there was a sense that the 
program should be

combined in some way between Utilities and Transportation as opposed to 
only Utilities.  The panel

needs to determine what they would want this program to be and where it 
will be in the Department

of Energy.  Dr. Takahashi suggested that a special day be set aside at 
the next meeting to discuss 

the details of this.
<p>
<b>Hydrogen 2000 - William Hoagland</b><br>

The first project of Hydrogen 2000 is a one hour documentary on the 
opportunity of hydrogen to be

shown in the interest of public education.  The crew has filmed in the 
United States, Canada, Europe

and Japan.  The project is receiving funding from three, possibly four, 
countries, the state of

California, municipal governments and about a dozen private 
organizations.  The documentary will

premiere at the World Hydrogen Energy Conference in Stuttgart the night 
of June 24th, 1996.  

Hydrogen Program Budget - Neil Rossmeissl/JoAnn Milliken

The program was appropriated $14.5 million dollars in FY96.  The 
long-term component is distributed

among the national labs and universities.  The determination of funding 
allocations to the labs and

to the individual projects is based on an annual peer review and the 
recommendations made by the

reviewers. Research priorities in the hydrogen program include the core 
activities developing the

longer term technologies, followed by other programs in utilization, 
analysis and near-term industry

projects.  Mr. Hoffman suggested that the National Research Council 
review the hydrogen program

and evaluate where it has been and where it needs to go in the future.  




The funding level for the fuel cell program has been relatively constant 
over the past three years:

63% allocated to systems development, 30% to R&D, with the remainder to 
supporting analysis and 

institutional assessment.  The program is developing a fuel cell 
operating on reformed methanol with

General Motors.  They have a direct hydrogen project involving Chrysler 
PentaStar, Allied Signal and

Aerospace.  They are developing ten kilowatt fuel cell stacks led by 
Ford.  Other subcontracts

address the issues of hydrogen infrastructure and storage.  The fuel 
cell program requested $40

million for FY96 and is requesting $30 million for FY97.  
<p>
<b>1996 HTAP Budget - Catherine Gregoire Padr¢</b><br>

The budget was steady in FY93 and FY94 and took a big increase in FY95 
because of the

publication of the Green Hydrogen Report and the establishment of four 
new committees.  In FY96

the four committees continue to meet, and three panel members will be 
attending the Stuttgart

meeting and holding an international panel discussion.  The program 
office did a large distribution

of the Green Hydrogen Report and got requests for additional copies.  
HTAP information and

activities as well as the Green Hydrogen Report will be on the Internet.  




Dr. Hoffman stated that he is a strong supporter of hydrogen.  He sees 
the program as long-term

with the priority of building a solid core program.  The Office of 
Utility Technologies encourages and

demands that programs work with the private sector to expedite 
technology transfer.  Hydrogen

needs to build a strong constituency that can effectively present its 
argument both to the

Administration and to the Hill.  Hydrogen and its applications in the 
transportation and utility sectors

can represent major markets for the United States and this potential 
should be strongly emphasized

when making the case for hydrogen.  The Olympic games in Atlanta this 
summer will be used as a

show case for hydrogen technologies.  Savannah River is expected to have 
a hydrogen bus ready

for the event.  
<p>
<b>Hydrogen Program Research Success Story - David Benson/David 
Haberman</b> <br>

Mr. Benson has developed a fiber optic sensor to detect hydrogen leaks 
and has entered into a

cooperative agreement with AMERISEN.  An overview of the technology was 
given by Benson,

followed by a discussion of the marketing aspects of the project by Mr. 
Haberman.
<p>
<b>NHA Hydrogen Industry Perspective - C.E. (Sandy) Thomas</b><br>

Dr. Thomas presented a list of possible roles for the National Hydrogen 
including facilitator of

information, selecting projects for hydrogen, codes and standards, 
international representation, and

recommending hydrogen demonstration projects.  The NHA will be putting 
together a five-year

industrial hydrogen plan this year.  They are working to establish a 
more viable relationship with

DOE.  Dr. Thomas suggested that HTAP and NHA collaborate on putting 
together the five-year

industrial plan.  HTAP will be invited to join the NHA industrial 
program workshops.  Dr. Takahashi

suggested that NHA write a vision statement which is more philosophical 
with a broader, longer

range.    
<p>

Hindenburg Story - Addison Bain</b>

Mr. Bain presented a status report on his investigation of the 
Hindenburg disaster to determine

whether it was caused by the hydrogen fuel onboard.  Using pictures 
taken of the incident, he

explained that the fire was actually a result of the combustion of a 
combination of materials.  He has

pieces of the ship that are being analyzed in the micro-chemistry lab in 
NASA to determine if nitrous

cellulose was used in the lacquer coating on the aluminum surfaces and 
also to determine if a black

compound on the girder was used to provide a conductive bond.  The 
entire investigation will be

documented on video and will look at the peripheral issues of the 
incident.  There will be a technical

report and analysis of some of the theories.  It will also be a document 
for the younger generation 

to uncover the truth of the story.
<p>
<b>Applications Committee Report - Mounir Kamal</b><br>

Dr. Kamal presented the panel with a report from the Applications 
Committee.  The report assesses

the current state of technology for hydrogen-powered vehicle relative to 
competitive technologies

according to the following criteria: vehicle operating and driving 
range, refueling infrastructure, and

the specific power of propulsion system.  The attributes were plotted 
with gasoline-powered vehicles

ranking best on power, costs, range and infrastructure but falling short 
on efficiency of propulsion,

emission and renewable fuel potential.  Fuel cell vehicles are best in 
efficiency, emissions and

renewable fuel potential, but deficient in customer attributes.  
Electric vehicles are superior to fuel

cells in infrastructure.  Natural gas will probably be the transition 
fuel before hydrogen in niche

market applications.  Hydrogen s high score on societal attributes make 
it more suitable for niche

markets such as government fleets and buses.  The report clearly shows a 
need to recognize that

hydrogen is superior on certain attributes while on other attributes, it 
is not competitive.  Research

needs to focus on those attributes in order for hydrogen to compete.
<p>    
<b>Demonstration Committee - Alan Lloyd</b><br>

This committee met in Reno, Nevada in March and discussed various 
demonstration programs,

funding agencies, and the appropriate goal for the committee.  The 
recommendations included the

support of regional demonstrations and linking various isolated 
demonstrations, the continuation of 

the demonstration of buses and heavy-duty vehicles, and working with FAA 
and NASA with hydrogen

and aircraft.  
<p>
<b>Sustainable Energy Centers - David Nahmias</b><br>

A questionnaire based on sustainable energy center concept resulted in 
strong support for the

formation of regional hydrogen centers.  A hydrogen center has been 
proposed in connection with

the Westinghouse Savannah River laboratory and ETEC - Rocketdyne 
Technology and Engineering

Center.  Recommendations include HTAP support of the formation of 
hydrogen centers and

monitoring activities without taking a lead role, the creation of 
centers that support demonstrations

projects and commercialization activities, and centers of excellence 
that focus on basic R&D.  
<p>
<b>Industry/Government Consortium - Addison Bain</b><br>

The concept of a hydrogen industry/government consortium was recommended 
in the Green

Hydrogen Report.  Dr. Lloyd cautioned against having the consortium 
driven by big industry to the

exclusion of entrepreneurs.  Dr. MacKenzie suggested that the mission 
and the objectives of an

alliance of this sort be made clear.  Dr. Takahashi suggested that Mr. 
Bain and Dr. Lloyd write a

position paper on the subject and present it to HTAP.  
<p>
<b>International Energy Agency - Catherine Gregoire Padr¢</b><br>

The IEA Hydrogen Implementation Agreement Annex 11 dealing with 
integrated systems met in

March to discuss the design and evaluation of  potential hydrogen 
demonstrations.  They will collect

experience and operating data on existing facilities in order to develop 
a design guideline tool. 

Subtask A will evaluate hydrogen energy systems that are at the pilot 
and demonstration scale. 

Subtask B will evaluate existing data using analysis tools.  Subtask C 
is focused on the development

of design guidelines.  These will be established to allow future 
demonstrations to meet operating and

user requirements, and also to facilitate systematic integration.
<p>
<b>Public Comments</b><br>

Malcolm LaBar of General Atomics Company addressed the panel concerning 
the production of

hydrogen without the generation of CO2 through nuclear energy and the 
use of a thermal chemical

process.  General Atomics is developing a gas turbine modular helium 
reactor that combines a melt-

down proof reactor and advanced power conversion system using a gas 
turbine.  Safety issues are

resolved with ceramic coatings that have high temperature capability 
that result in the system being

able to tolerate very high temperatures without meltdown.  The 
hydrocarbon and silicone carbide

coatings have life times in the depository environment to a million 
years.  General Atomics is

operating with a higher efficiency cycle than any other system.  


<p>Dr. Larry Berg of Ballard was successful in getting the California ZEV 
mandate changed to include

fuel cells as a viable technology that will be included and considered 
as advanced technology under

the ZEV program.  Dr. Berg urges that  the hydrogen community move their 
visibility into the area

of those who are not informed but are in key decision-making positions.  



<p>Mr. William Chesshire of Hydrogen Development Corporation spoke of 
politics as the world of people

and that no one is going to make an economic investment without 
assurance of a return.  The best

reassurance that they could have is a credible hydrogen system.  There 
is a need and a market for

public educational and informational products.


<p>Mr. Bob Miller of Air Products and Chemicals presented the panel with 
a technology being developed

by Amoco Production Company for membrane materials that has demonstrated 
high oxygen fluxes

for the conversion of methane to synthesis gas.  They are looking for a 
new low-cost means of

producing, converting gas to liquids as well as producing hydrogen.  ITM 
syngas may have

application to large-scale production of hydrogen as well as smaller 
scale because of the lower

thermal and energy efficiency of this technology.  Lower-cost hydrogen 
will develop a new source

of hydrogen for upgrading crude oils as they become low in quality.


<p>Mr. Paul Scott of Touchstone Technology addressed the importance of 
using hydrogen as the fuel

in fuel cells.  The need for diversity of fuels, the pollution problem, 
global warming, safety, and

eventual lower cost of hydrogen are among the reasons for using 
hydrogen.
<p>
<b>HTAP Suggestions</b><br> 

With direction from HTAP, Addison Bain will meet with NASA and FAA to 
see if there is a basis for

continued support for the hydrogen-fueled aircraft issue and perhaps 
convince NASA to participate

in HTAP activities.   Mr. Rossmeissl suggested that HTAP write an annual 
synopsis report of

activities and accomplishments that could be presented to the Secretary 
or Assistant Secretary. 

Committee reports will be incorporated into this final report.  HTAP 
will review the draft  five-plan. 

The next HTAP meeting will be held September 9-11, 1996 in Colorado.  
HTAP will  work on their

consensus of program scope.  Mr. Hainsselin would like to see a 
continuation to push for the existing

future market focus in future discussions.  Mr. Lynch suggested that 
someone from a federal agency

come to give HTAP an Air Resources Board viewpoint.  Dr. Lloyd will try 
to get someone from EPA

as well.
<p>

Dr. Takahashi thanked all of the participants and adjourned the 
proceedings at 2:50 p.m.
