<EM><STRONG>Gifted Education and School Reform: 
Making the Connection</STRONG></EM><BR>
<STRONG>Video.</STRONG> A fast-paced video that lays out the basic tensions between leaders of gifted education and school reform. Both groups show concern for serving the diverse needs of students who are gifted but struggle with the ways those needs should be met. This video sets the stage for productive dialog among parents, school board members, administrators, and teachers. It models a process for working through differences and arriving at a set of mutually agreed upon recommendations for serving children and youth who are gifted. <P>

<STRONG>Video</STRONG>. The focus is on the specific tensions between advocates for the “middle-school” philosophy and advocates for gifted programs.
