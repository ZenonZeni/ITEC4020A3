<h4>W10<br>
WEDNESDAY 8:30 AM-10:00 AM</h4>

<h3>Interpreting Neuropsychological Assessments <br>
From the Perspective of Language and  Learning:<br>
An Analysis of the WISC-III and Story Memory Tests</h3>
<b>Presenter: <br>
Sandra N. Kleinman, Ed.D. 
</b>, The Howard School, Atlanta, GA 

<p>There has been an important shift from domain-specific assessments to
integrated assessment models 
reflecting the variability in language-learning profiles of children and
adolescents across tasks and social 
contexts. The presenter will analyze two neuropsychological assessment
tools - WISC-III and Story 
Memory Tests - from which information about language-learning disorders
can be gleaned.

<h3>Translating Test Results into Action at School and at
Home</h3>

<b>Ruth B. Spodak, Ph.D. </b>, McLean School, Rockville, MD

<p>An overview of the WISC-III and other tests used to diagnose learning
disabilities will be presented. 
Parents, teachers and counselors will be shown how to interpret test
results to develop appropriate 
strategies and accommodations for students with learning disabilities.
Subsequent discussion will 
emphasize the role of the family and parent-school communication in
helping the student experience 
success.

<h3>The Effect of Word-Finding Difficulties<br>
 on Students' Cognitive Assessments</h3>

<b>Diane J. German, Ph.D. </b>, National-Louis University,
Evanston, IL
<p>An investigation that examines the potential effect of students'
word-finding difficulties on their 
intellectual assessment will be presented. A retrieval deficit” rather
than a conceptual deficit hypothesis” 
will be proposed as underlying lower cognitive scores earned by students
with word-finding difficulties. An 
adapted-assessment model will be recommended.

<h3>Diagnosing Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder with Adults:<br>
What’s Definitive and What’s 
Plausible?</h3>
<b>Melinda Parrill, Ph.D. </b>, Child and Family Institute, Atlanta, GA 

<p>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in adults is diagnosed in
diversely different ways: a 
professional’s apparent snap judgment; complaints of others;
self-diagnosis; positive medication response; 
psychological testing; and integration from multiple sources. Within this
presentation cautions and 
considerations will be addressed. Case studies will be used to illustrate
the diagnostic significance of 
differential diagnosis, comorbidity, and life circumstances when making a
plausible diagnosis.

<h3>A Shift in Assessment and Instruction of Reading<br>
for Students with Learning Disabilities </h3>
<b>Jeffrey P. Bakken</b>, Illinois State University, Normal, IL<br>
<b>David L. Tucker</b>, Illinois State University, Normal, IL
<p>In this presentation teachers and parents will be provided information
on the traditional and alternative 
models of assessment and instruction of reading for students with learning
disabilities. Examples of a 
student identified with a learning disability assessed and instructed
under both models will be shared.

<h3>A Hierarchy for Assessing and Remediating <br>
Phonemic Segmentation Difficulties</h3>
<b>Corinne R. Smith, Ph.D. </b>, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY 
<p>Teachers will be introduced to a hierarchy of assessment and
intervention tasks useful for children 
whose reading delays relate to phonemic segmentation difficulties. A
variety of tasks will be demonstrated 
and a handout of over 30 tasks will be distributed to participants.

Disabilities the opportunity to demonstrate their higher order thinking
abilities in challenging problem solving 
contexts.

<h3><i>PowerPath</i> to Adult Basic Learning: <br>
 A Practical Intake, Diagnostic Screening, and Software System<br>
Targeting the Needs of Adults with Learning Difficulties </h3>

<b>Laura Weisel, Ph.D. </b>, The TLP Group, Columbus, OH <br>
<b>Althea O'Haver</b>, The Walton Family to Work Project, Little Rock, AR
<i>PowerPath</i> is a practical intake and diagnostic screening system for
adults entering basic skill and 
literacy programs. <i>PowerPath</i> screens for LD and defines how each
person can most effectively 
learn. Based upon the individual's profile, it prescribes personalized
pathways to successfully build needed 
skills. Instructors complete the Process with the participant by designing
a Personal Learning Plan using 
recommended accommodations to learn basic skills. This session will
discuss the variety of ways in which 
<i>PowerPath</i> is being used in basic skill and literacy programs
throughout the country.
