<B>Project Title:  Data Acquisition<p>

Performing Organization:   B & W Engineering Enterprises, Inc., Delphi Energy & Engine Management Systems, Allison Transmission Division of GMC, Indiana University ­ Purdue University at Indianapolis</B><p>


Technical POC: Hamp Barnett, B & W. (423) 238­7279<br>
Bob Bridgewater, Delphi­E, (317) 579­4988 

<P><B>Project Summary:</B></P>

<P>Independent research and testing conducted by B & W Engineering Enterprises was preformed to validate performance, functionality, and power quality of both the hybrid electric buses, electric pickups, and their charging systems. B & W was utilized as an expert consultant on several technical issues.  Feedback to the manufacturer was provided as testing was completed.</P>

<P>Three electric E­10 pickup truck conversions and three 22 foot hybrid electric shuttle buses are equipped with on­board
data acquisition systems (DAS). The intention of the system is for vehicle performance­related data to be recorded at
regular intervals and saved in a format required by and transferred to the Electric Vehicle National Data Center (EV
NDC). The DAS is composed of sensors throughout the vehicle, an AeroVironment data acquisition unit, a
serially­connected Macintosh PowerBook 180 computer, and custom software running on the PowerBook. The DAS
continuously monitors all input sensor channels and serially outputs a format. A driver information log is to be
maintained and its data manually entered and then ready to be sent to the EV NDC.</P>

<P><B>Project Deliverables:</B></P>

<P> Report on test results and analysis as well as power quality. Installation of DAS in three electric
pickups and three hybrid shuttle buses. Data collection, transfer, and user­site support. </P>

<P><B>Project Schedule:</B></P>
