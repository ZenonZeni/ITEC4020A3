        <h3>Cochlear Implant Rehabilitation </h3>
        <p>St. Joseph's is among the nation's preeminent centers
        for cochlear implant rehabilitation. A dedicated program,
        under the direction of therapy specialists, has attracted
        more implanted students to SJI than any other school in
        America. </p>
        <p>The cochlear implant is the most advanced technology
        designed to transmit sound for profoundly hearing
        impaired persons. But without post-implant therapy, a
        child reaps only partial benefit from the device because
        it merely makes new sounds available. The child must be
        taught how to decode these new sounds and translate them
        into improved speech and language. </p>
        <p>A cochlear implant bypasses the damaged inner ear by
        means of a multi-channel electrode that provides auditory
        information directly to the brain. Not all hearing
        impaired children would benefit from an implant. St.
        Joseph's speech therapists and audiologists play a
        critical role in evaluating a child's candidacy for one. </p>
        <p>For those students who are candidates, a cochlear
        implant, along with therapy, offers the potential to
        significantly advance their language ability, and with
        it, their quality of life. </p>
        <p>Having counseled an increasing number of implanted
        students during the 1980's. the institute committed its
        resources to a formal rehabilitation program in 1987. </p>
        <p>At that time, it enrolled four implanted students.
        This number doubled each of the next several years until
        currently one-third of SJI's student body has cochlear
        implants. </p>
        <p>All implanted students meet individually with the
        director of the rehabilitation program for one half hour,
        every day of the school year, for up to three years.
        Through phonetic discrimination and auditory
        comprehension drills, the students learn to decode the
        new sounds and use them in speech formation. This is in
        addition to the speech and auditory training they receive
        in their other classes. </p>
        <p>The audiology department closely monitors the mapping
        of the implant as the child first gets used to new sounds
        and then becomes increasingly capable of processing them. </p>
        <p>The Institute maintains a strong professional
        relationship with a number of the nation's leading
        cochlear implant surgical teams. It is committed to
        remaining at the fore front of new technology benefiting
        hearing impaired children </p>
