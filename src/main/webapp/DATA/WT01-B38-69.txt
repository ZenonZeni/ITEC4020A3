<h1><i>Richardson-Taylor Reunion News </i> </h1>

<p>Last call to make your plans for the annual reunion! If you
have not made arrangements to attend the reunion you should do it
now. </p>

<p>Margaret sent me a couple of maps to help you out in locating
the more important sites in the area of the reunion. You may note
that she has indicated the location of her home on one of the
maps. I am not sure, but I believe she mentioned that if anyone
could not find any other camping space or an available motel,
they could camp on her front lawn. No need to call - just pitch
your tent and be there when she wakes up in the morning. She
should enjoy it. </p>

<p>Margaret says she has a new grandchild, and Bud a new
great-grandchild, so you can expect both of them to be
particularly boastful this year. Dorothy says that Margaret is an
unusually aggressive grandmother so it may be best to avoid her
altogether. </p>

<p>Only a few of you have sent back your family information
forms. Of course, there is no compulsion to send in your form (or
contributions) - it is entirely voluntary. You will note,
however, that Don and Elinor did not send theirs in last year.
This year, Elinor was quite prompt. </p>

<p>As you all may have expected, there has been no word from the <b>low-down,
no-good Richardson individual living in Ohio who has never
attended even a single family reunion.</b> (Due to my extreme
respect for <b>Bill Henry</b>, I will not mention the name of
this thoroughly disreputable individual.) </p>

<p>Because the <b>low-down, no-good Richardson individual living
in Ohio who has never attended even a single family reunion</b>
has not returned his family information form, and has no apparent
intention of attending even a single family reunion, I shall have
to fill in his family's information the best I can. Therefore, I
am asking all of you to think hard and come up with all the
stories from this individual's past which most clearly delineate
his complete lack of character. There are a number of episodes
from his past which I am quite certain he would not want repeated
under any circumstances (I can think of several that are so
disgusting they would gag a maggot and make a hooker blush) so
let's collect all of these tales and make sure they are published
where all the world can read them. Because <b>he has never
attended even a single family reunion</b> we all know that he is
beyond shame, but perhaps we can induce some shame in some other
member of his immediate family. </p>

<p>I have completed the editing and formatting of Mary Taylor's
family history and I had intended to include it in this mailing,
but my laser printer is having serious problems so it will have
to wait. Besides, I am not sure if I want to send something so
worthwhile to that <b>low-down, no-good Richardson individual
living in Ohio who has never attended even a single family
reunion.</b> With any luck I should be able to have it printed
and ready to distribute to anyone who attends the reunion, which
will naturally exclude that <b>low-down, no-good Richardson
individual living in Ohio who has never attended even a single
family reunion.</b> </p>

<p>We will see you all at the reunion (with the exception of a
certain nameless and shameless Richardson individual). Call
Margaret if you have any questions. </p>
