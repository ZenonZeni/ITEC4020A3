<H2 align=CENTER><I>Who will be president in 1996 and why?</I></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PREZ -->
<LI>of the possible candidates, Bob Dole. He has intergrity and is basically an honest, hard working man.
<LI>Bill Clinton: His version of international relations is more palatable to other nations.
<LI>Bob Dole because he didn't avoid the serving 
our country like Bill Clinton did

<LI>Bill CLINTON because he seems to be the only capable person to reduce the deficit,improve education and respect racial and ethnic minorities.
<LI>I wanted to see Bob Dole win, but unfortunately
this was not the case.
<LI>Hi -
     I realize this is a little late, but it is my personal feelings. The Government is medling in  our lives far to much and it MUST stop. Maybe with a revolution and kick the liberal commies OUT !!!
     If there was a militia in this area, I would become a active participate.
          Edward Cookingham
          Kingston, NY
<LI>He should not have people under the age of 18 pay income taxes and then not have the right to vote.
<LI>Bill Clinton cares about this country & 
especially cares about the youth of this
country.
<LI>Someone who would follow our constitution. Who is that person?
<LI>Bill Clinton 'cause he is just what your country deserves.
<LI>Anyone willing to do what is right for the American middle-class. This can be best done by returning to the Constitution and limiting "Judicial Legislation".
<LI>Bob Dole, because I feel he will be better for the economy and reduce the power of the federal goverment

<LI>Colin Powell. 
<LI>Clinton 
<LI>Bob Dole, simply stated-any one is better than Clinton
<LI>Pat Buchannan- agrees with most social issues that I do.
<LI>Al Gore
<LI>Clinton because he's been a very good President so far.
<LI>Bob Dole, in part because I like Jack Kemp, and because I think he is an honest person.

<LI>Bill Bennet.
<LI>Harry Browne. Cut the crap, kids. Grow up and take responsibility for yourself; question the intent of anybody who tries to take that responsibility away from you.

<LI>Harry Browne. The only candidate dedicated to
preserving liberty, freedom and justice. 
<LI>Lyndon Larouche would be my first choice, however I feel that David Duke would be a better,more PC choice.
<LI>dole-honest
<LI>I resent the fact that Perot was not entered into the debates.  He was not allowed to present his platform until it was too late.  He is just what our country could've used- someone to shake things up a bit!

<LI>I'm running for president next time.  Vote for Juan Valdez
<LI>Clinton.
<LI>Dole-because he is not a pathological liar, like Clinton.
<LI>Clinton are dump! Whitewater is not for 
gotten!I love Bob Dole.The White House belomgs
to Bob! He is my HERO and my KING !
<LI>BOB DOLE, BECAUSE A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN MY OPINION WILL
PROTECT OUR CIVIL RIGHTS BETTER THAN A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT.
<LI>Someone who is more representative of the gen'l population, not someone as old as Dole....they are not as aware of issues today and have too many past ideals.
<LI>Clinton.  Dole's ideas scare me and I think they're bad for the country.
<LI>Bill Clinton--he is just the better canidate
<LI>Bob Dole, He is a more moral person.
Bill Clinton is morally bankrupt homo-sapien.
<LI>I am glad Clinton won, things would be a whole lot worse with a religious-right Republican in the White House.  I value a woman's right to choose and the environment too much to deviate from my choice of government officials.
<LI>Dan Qualye, because he has the exspirence to do a great good and is the kind of man we can respect in the White house

<LI>OJ SIMPSON SHOULD BE PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO GET FLATCHESTED WHITE WOMEN TO HAVE TIT JOBS,
AND THEN KILL THEM.  FREE OJ! FRY FUHRMAN!
<LI>Bob Dole because he's a Republican and he would serve our country well.  He has great ideas.  Clinton doesn't know what he's doing.  All he cares about is ratings and women.
<LI>I want to see Bill Clinton because I agree
with his stance on social issues.
<LI>I suppose Clinton, because he has done ok so far.

<LI>Bill Clinton because he is best fit for the job.
<LI>I have seen no one resently that would provided the proper tools to be a great American leader
<LI>Dole because he more fiscally conservative
<LI>Clinton, he can do the jobj.
<LI>Dole, we need a change
<LI>Clinton
<LI>I feel good!

<LI>Even though Bubba won, Bob Dole would have been the right man for the job.
The reason for this is simple, he is a red white and blue American who wants to see this 
country get better; on the other hand, Clinton does want to see the country get better,
but with him in office, things will be like the way they were the last four years-slow 
and unchanging.
<LI>bill clinton ... i'm from arkansa

<LI>Harry Browne, our last, best hope for victory!
<LI>I want to see someone who is honest and is not afraid  to stand up to the NRA and smoking lobbyist

<LI>Harry Browne because he pledges to reduce government.  (The above request evades the essence of the interrogation.)
<LI>Someone who can work with the present system and yet remain honest about his/her views.  Also someone who is a moderate in the politcal spectrum and is tolerant of other views.
<LI>Bill Clinton - more in touch with the issues facing the American society today
<LI>Even though its all over, Clinton should be president because he is willing to make education
less expensive, which will elevate the lower class and reduce crime
<LI>Rip Scherer, University of Memphis head football coach.  If he can
beat Tennessee with his team, he can certainly lead our government.
<LI>Clinton- he has worked hard to pass his legislation and with an added
four years, and more public support, i feel he could help to reduce the deficit
as well as address other concerns of our country. 
<LI>Former Defense Secretary, Richard (dick) Cheney
<LI>Kemp, as a moderate he would be able to bring different sides together

<LI>Ron Faucheux, Publisher & Editor of Campaigns & Elections Magazine.  He is politically saavy, in addition to being inovative and directed -- besides, he would take the job seriously.
<LI>i voted for clinton because he was pro-choice and more tolerant of homosexuals then the others.
<LI>I would like to see Colin Powell become the next president.  I think that his moderately conservative economic positions along with his moderately liberal social positions reflect the principles I most agree with.  I also feel that his election would help with race relations.
<LI>Arnold Schwarzenegger
<LI>Steve Forbes because he has proven himself in the private sector
<LI>It doesn't matter anymore... the sleazebag won.

<LI>President Clinton because of his past record and successes
<LI>Someone who has intelligence, honor and believes that we are dependant on our planet for life and conducts business accoridingly and the we are all (not just U.S. citizens) of one family and conducts business accordingly
<LI>i don't really know, it all seems like a big show too me, we all knew clinton was going to win in the beginning, i cant wait till the next presidential election, that will be fun!

<LI>A reasonable man.
<LI>Jack Kemp, would have been my choice for president in 1996. I was surprised that Dole got the Republican nomination

<LI>John Haglin because of transendental meditation, will sove stress, the route cause for everything.
<LI>Clinton- only because I know Perot can't win, and anything's better than Dole
<LI>Dole. He'll put those goddam niggers and commies in their place.
<LI>Harry Browne in 2000!
Basically because he is the only candidate who WILL reduce all
aspects of government - DRASTICALLY and NOW.
<LI>I believe that Bill Clinton should be the next president because understands the role of government in the life of the citizens.  I beleive also the the economy is going in the direction and Clinton desire some of the credit for the success of our growth.
