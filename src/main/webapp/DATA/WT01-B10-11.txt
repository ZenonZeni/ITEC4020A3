"Doctor, I can't get pregnant!" Kathy's voice belied her controlled exterior. <p>"We want a baby so badly. You're our last hope."<p>
"Kathy," I said, glancing at her history form, "tell me when your periods stopped."<p>
She sat straight and squared her shoulders. "Two years ago."<p>
I scanned the page. "You're a runner. Do you enter the Peachtree Roadrace?"<p>
Her face brightened. "I wouldn't miss it. Last year I came in twelfth."<p>
"That's very good. How long have you been running?"<p>
"I really started training two years ago. Up to then I wasn't so serious about competing."<p>
Two years ago, I thought. And two years ago her periods stopped. Now I had the first important clue to Kathy's fertility problem.<p>
I knew she wouldn't like what I was about to suggest. "Kathy, we know that women athletes often complain that their periods stop. Of course, I need to know a lot more about <i>you</i>, but I wouldn't be surprised if your training regimen is contributing to your fertility problem."<p>
Her smile faded. "You mean I'll have to stop running?"<p>
"Not at all," I assured her. "Many women athletes keep in shape even while they are pregnant. But first, let's figure out how to help you get you pregnant."<p>
She smiled. "Sounds good to me."<p>

Physical exertion is only one of many factors that may affect your fertility. Critical points about your development, medical history, and life-style all give me vital clues to solving your fertility problem. In this chapter you'll learn what your doctors investigations into your past can reveal, and gain insight into what may be causing your fertility problem.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>Analyzing Your Life-style</h2>

<b>Excessive or Rigorous Exercise</b><br>

This cause of infertility may be grounded in our ancestral heritage. If food supplies were low, we followed herds of migrating animals or ranged far and wide to gather fruits and grain. A pregnancy would impair the woman's ability to keep up with the group. To improve her odds for survival during famine, nature decreased her fertility so that she stopped ovulating and her periods ceased (amenorrhea). This is probably the same protective mechanism that caused Kathy S.'s problem. <p>  Fortunately, resolving Kathy's hormonal imbalance was easy once I identified the cause. I'll tell you how we treat amenorrhea in a later chapter.<p>

<b>Emotional  Stress</b><br>

 Most women with fertility problems appear to be under a great deal of
stress. But we don't know for any one person whether the stress contributed
to the fertility problem, or whether the fertility problem brought on the stress.
Many women in high stress situations become pregnant, so we can't say
conclusively that stress will disrupt your hormonal balance.<p>
 We do know, however, that stress can affect your hypothalamus, the part
of your brain that controls sex hormones. And we know that some women
who have no apparent reason for being infertile except stress will often
respond to a medication that improves hypothalamic function.<p>
 I'm not saying that the old wives' tale "Just relax and you'll get pregnant"
will work. However, there's a great deal about the link between fertility and
stress that we don't understand.<p>

<b>Dieting and Nutrition</b><br>

 Low calorie diets, special athletic diets, eating disorders, and other restric-
tive eating practices may impair your fertility. A number of factors may cause
this problem: <p><dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">  Losing the weight itself<p><dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">  Reaching a low percentage of
body fat<p><dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">  Reaching an absolute minimum weight<p><dl><dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">  Stressing the body<p><dd><img align=top src="blue.gif">  Suffering from a nutritional imbalance.</dl><p> The mechanism for reducing
your fertility isn't clear and it may vary from one individual to another. Like
Kathy S., however, the most common complaint is amenorrhea, lack of
menstrual periods. (I frequently find that teenagers who have been on crash
diets stop having periods.)<p>
Fortunately this is one of the easiest fertility problems to correct. When
you change your diet and gain weight, you usually start ovulating and menstruation
resumes.<p>
Strangely enough, I've also seen ovulation stop in women who follow <i>strict vegetarian diets</i>. I remember one woman who ate so many carrots that her genitals turned bright orange. The stress of her diet and high blood levels of carotene (from eating carrots) may have caused her anovulation. Rather than taking medication to induce ovulation, she chose to cut down on her vegetables and add fish and eggs (protein) to her diet. Having thus increased her caloric and protein intake, she began ovulating and soon became pregnant.<p>
Women weighing two hundred pounds or more may also have fertility problems. This may also be one of nature's protective mechanisms, since obesity does not provide the best environment for fetal development and birth. In fact, before the age of modern medicine, many obese women and their babies died in childbirth. Nature apparently prefers to reduce your fertility and wait for you to lose weight.<p>
I remember one woman who, at five foot four and 188 pounds, complained of irregular periods with heavy flow. The reasons for her fertility problem are interesting. It seems that fat cells themselves can convert androgens (male hormones produced by the ovaries and adrenal gland) into estrogen (female hormone). Assessing all her symptoms, I suspected that her fat cells were producing enough estrogen to confuse her brain. Her brain, thinking that the ovaries were producing the estrogen, lowered her pituitary gland hormone production, which in turn led to anovulation. (You'll learn more about how these complex hormonal systems control your monthly cycles and fertility in the <a href="ch10mb.html">next chapter</a>.)
Once I explained how this woman's obesity affected her fertility and general health, she was more than willing to start a diet. A well-planned weight-reduction diet and exercise program eventually restored her fertility. And since her "reduced" fat cells no longer produced excess estrogen, she got a bonus: her risk of developing endometrial cancer diminished, too.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>Gathering Medical Clues</h2>

<b>Pelvic and Reproductive Tract Surgery</b><br>

Adhesions (scar tissue) inside the abdominal cavity caused by pelvic infections or abdominal surgery can impair fertility. I commonly find scar tissue in women who have had surgery for ruptured appendix, bowel repair, cesarean section, ectopic pregnancy, or the removal of an ovarian cyst. Twisting around the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and even the uterus, these inflexible webs of scar tissue restrict the natural mobility of these delicate organs.<p>
Margaret B., for example, had a ruptured appendix when she was twenty-three. When I looked at her reproductive organs through the laparoscope (telescope), I found that her pelvic adhesions were so extensive they prevented her eggs from entering her fallopian tubes. I clipped and removed the tissue from around the organs so that Margaret's tubes could once again gently flex and coax the ova down the narrow passage toward the waiting sperm.<p>
Scarring may also occur inside the uterus. Debbie W., for example, came to me about a year after having a D & C, saying, "Ever since my gynecologist scraped out my uterus, instead of having a period I just spot each month." When I looked into her uterus with a hysteroscope (small telescope), I found her uterine walls stuck to one another. I used a rather simple yet effective procedure to separate her uterine walls so they could heal and begin functioning normally. I'll discuss more about this procedure in a <a href="ch19mb.html">later chapter</a>.<p>
<b>Frequent Vaginitis</b><br>

If you suffer from frequent yeast or trichomonas infections, you may also have chlamydia, which can cause tubal damage. Because of increased exposure, women with a number of different sexual partners have a much greater chance of contracting these infections. A history of frequent vaginitis will alert me to the possibility that you have pelvic adhesions and tubal blockage. Once diagnosed, these abnormalities may respond to corrective surgery.<p>
<b>Illnesses May Impair Fertility</b><br>

A number of illnesses can lead to impaired fertility. The most obvious ones are the venereal or sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, ureaplasma infection, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). These diseases can scar your uterus, block your tubes, and cause the formation of pelvic adhesions.
I remember one woman who said that four years ago her doctor thought she had a gallbladder problem. "I had a pain right here," she said, holding her hand over the lower right half of her rib cage. "I guess it just went away, because I haven't had any more trouble."<p>
After asking her several questions about her symptoms I suspected that instead of having a gallbladder problem, she had probably contracted PID. After further tests, I discovered that PID had caused her liver to adhere to the inside of her abdominal wall, a condition called Fitzhugh-Curtis syndrome. Once I surgically removed the adhesions and repaired her scarred fallopian tubes, she soon became pregnant.<p>
Other diseases such as hepatitis fever disease) and kidney disease can cause fertility problems. Both your liver and kidneys filter and remove waste products, toxic substances, and impurities from your blood. A buildup of wastes and unmetabolized (not chemically broken down) hormones may interfere with your menstrual cycle. When these diseases are brought under control, fertility usually returns.<p>
Thyroid gland disorders may also interfere with fertility. Increased metabolism from an overproduction of thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) will burn up your estrogen supply faster than your body can make it. Without estrogen you cannot ovulate. In contrast, if your thyroid gland produces insufficient thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism), you will stockpile too much estrogen and you may have an elevated prolactin level. If you have an excess of these two hormones, your ovaries cannot function normally. Regulating your thyroid production through surgery or thyroid supplements usually restores fertility.<p>
Adult onset diabetes or insulin resistance may interfere with normal menstrual cycles.  High levels of insulin abnormaly stimulate the ovary to make high levels of male hormones which block normal ovulation.<p>
Hypertension (high blood pressure) may be associated with an adrenal gland disorder that causes excessive production of male hormones (androgens). Increased androgens can disrupt normal ovarian function as well as disturb your female secondary sex characteristics.<p>
I remember one woman referred to me for a fertility workup said, "Doctor, I'm growing a mustache!" The hair growth on her upper lip (a condition called hirsutism), very oily skin, and acne told me she was probably producing excessive androgens. As I expected, her blood tests revealed that she had an overactive adrenal gland. When she received medication to slow her androgen production down, her periods resumed, and much to her relief her mustache stopped growing.<p>
<b>Treatment for Abnormal <a href="gopher://gopher.uiuc.edu:70/00/UI/CSF/health/heainfo/women/pap">Pap Smears</a></b><br>

<a href="gloss.html#Cone">Cone biopsy</a>, laser surgery, <a href="http://www.oncolink.upenn.edu/specialty/gyn_onc/leep.html">Leep</a>, or cryosurgery may be used to treat a condition detected by an abnormal Pap smear. Any of these procedures can degrade the quality of your cervical mucus to the point that sperm cannot travel into your uterus. I performed a cone biopsy on a twenty-seven-year-old patient of mine who had a precancerous Pap smear result. I hoped I could halt the growth of abnormal tissues and prevent Nancy V. from developing cervical cancer. A year later she married and wanted to have a baby. When I performed a postcoital test, I found that her mucus was too scant and thick for the sperm to pass. So I recommended we wash her husband's sperm and inject them directly into her uterus (intrauterine artificial insemination homologous). After three tries Nancy became pregnant.<p>
A cone biopsy can also weaken the cervix and allow premature pregnancy loss. So during Nancy V.'s pregnancy I watched her cervix to make sure that it stayed shut until delivery. Fortunately all went well and she delivered an eight-pound fourteen-ounce baby boy. I'll discuss more about the procedures I used with Nancy in  <a href="ch19mb.html">chapter 19</a>.<p>

<b><A HREF="http://nysernet.org/bcic/bmt/bmt.book/chapter.11.html#p112">Anticancer Agents and Radiation</a></b><br>

Anticancer agents such as methotrexate or radiation treatment may also compromise your fertility. Radiation can cause not only pelvic adhesions but also chromosomal damage to your eggs. If you're concerned about the effects of these treatments, talk with your doctor.<p>

<b>Endometriosis</b><br>
<A HREF="endo5.jpg"><IMG ALIGN=right IMG SRC="endo5.gif"></A>
<A HREF="endoassn.html">Endometriosis</a> may scar your fallopian tubes, interfere with your ability to ovulate, and prevent embryo implantation. Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissue outside the womb. Unfortunately we do not know the exact mechanism by which endometriosis forms. Being sensitive to monthly hormonal changes, this tissue grows and then, as does the endometrium in the uterus, sheds during menstruation. This "bleeding" inside the abdominal cavity is very painful, as Shelley T. testified: "When my period starts, my cramps get so bad I have to go to bed."<p>
When I looked inside Shelley T.'s abdomen with a laparoscope, I found extensive pelvic inflammation and scarring. Since endometriosis can also cause tubal blockage, I injected dye into her uterus and tubes to see if they were open. I was really relieved to see the blue inklike fluid seeping out each fimbria (the opening of the fallopian tube near the ovary).<p>
Fortunately endometriosis frequently responds to hormonal therapy and, when necessary, to <A HREF="laprscpy.html">surgery</a>. In Shelley's case I decided to use the laparoscope and a small instrument passed through a second small incision to cut her adhesions. Then I used a laser to selectively cauterize and excise the endometrial implants. She received GnRHa (Synarel
, <a href="gloss.html#Lupron">Lupron</a>, <a href="glos.html#Zoladex">Zoladex</a>) for three months after her surgery and then attempted pregnancy. A later chapter will explain more about these procedures.<p>
<b>German Measles (Rubella)</b><br>

German measles (rubella) does not impair fertility. However, if you con-tract rubella during the first half of your pregnancy, your baby will likely suffer from severe defects, including deafness and mental retardation. It would be tragic to undergo extensive fertility treatment only to achieve a pregnancy blighted by German measles. Therefore, I always do a blood test to determine if my fertility patient is immune to German measles. If the test is negative, I give her a rubella vaccine. I then recommend that the couple use barrier contraception, such as condoms, for three months to avoid the remote possibility that the live virus vaccine could affect their baby.<p>
<b>
Tender Breasts and Milky Discharge
</b><br>
If your breasts are tender or if you have a milky discharge, you may have breast tumors. If I cannot detect any abnormal growths, I look for other factors that can cause a hormone imbalance_for example, an excess production of prolactin.<p>
Prolactin, one of the primary hormones responsible for milk production (lactation), suppresses ovulation. I remember one patient who came to me because she hadn't responded to the drugs her doctor prescribed to induce her to ovulate. Heather P. complained of milk leaking from her breasts, so I suspected that her pituitary gland was producing excessive amounts of prolactin. When this was confirmed by a blood test, I prescribed Parlodel (bromocriptine, an oral medication. That did the trick and she got pregnant in her very next cycle. I'll discuss this treatment more in <a href="ch12mb.html">chapter 12</a>.<p>

<b>Neurological Disorders</b><br>

Any disturbance in your central nervous system may interrupt the delicate hormonal coordination between your hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries. If you suffer from seizures, epilepsy, visual disturbances, poor sense of smell, dizziness, loss of balance, or chronic headaches, you may have a neurological disorder. If you take medication to control epilepsy, nervous tension, depression, and so forth, the drugs themselves may interfere with your fertility. I remember one RESOLVE member who reported that when her doctor changed her antidepressant to a different prescription she began ovulating three months later. I may consult with a neurologist if I feel the disorder requires further diagnosis and treatment. Once we correct the neurological abnormality, fertility may return naturally.<p>

<b>Medications That Compromise Fertility</b>

A number of medications may compromise your fertility. If you take hormones, antibiotics, or antihypertensives, they can prevent an embryo from implanting in your uterus. If taken in the middle of your menstrual cycle, Motrin, Anaprox, Indocin, or aspirin_usually taken to ease menstrual cramps_may prevent your ovary from releasing a ripened egg. Antidepres-sants, hallucinogens, painkillers, and alcohol may increase your prolactin levels and cause ovulation failure. When you stop these medications (and <i>don't</i> stop taking any medications without consulting your doctor first), fertility usually resumes.<p>
Be sure to tell your doctor about every prescription or over-the-counter drug you take. These drugs may not only play a part in your fertility problem but, should you become pregnant, they may also jeopardize the development of your infant. My general rule of thumb is "When in doubt, do not take it." We honestly do not know the effects of all drugs on a pregnancy, particularly when taken in combination with other medications.<p>

<b>Illicit Drugs</b><br>

Central nervous system depressants such as heroin or large, frequent doses of marijuana can interfere with your sex drive and with the hormonal balance necessary for ovulation and menstruation. Don't bother to pay for expensive fertility treatment if you plan to continue taking these drugs. Besides, during your pregnancy, a number of these drugs may also threaten your unborn child. Both marijuana and tobacco cigarettes increase the carbon monoxide level in your blood and impair your unborn baby's oxygen supply. Without adequate oxygen, tissues and vital organs may be damaged or killed. Taking hard drugs like cocaine will also reduce the life-sustaining blood supply to your unborn baby. When you stop using these toxic chemicals, your fertility usually returns.<p>

<b>Massive Hemorrhage During Childbirth</b><br>

At a RESOLVE meeting I met a woman who had nearly died with the birth of her first child. During her delivery she had suffered a massive hemorrhage. "They gave me twelve blood transfusions," she reported. "My baby and I just barely survived." She picked up her infant and held her close. "I tried to nurse Rachael, but she was starving, so I gave it up. After a few weeks it was all I could do to get out of bed, feed her, and change her diapers."<p>
Her husband interrupted. "I knew something had to be wrong, so I put Sarah and Rachael in the car and drove them to the doctor."<p>
"The doctor told us that massive bleeding associated with pregnancy sometimes shocks the pituitary gland to the point that it dies," Sarah said. "He called it <i>Sheehan's syndrome</i>. He didn't know exactly why this hap-pened to me, but my pituitary may have suffered a temporary loss of its blood supply."<p>
Since Sarah's damaged pituitary gland no longer controlled her thyroid hormone production, adrenal hormone production, and blood sugar levels, she experienced a wide range of symptoms including extreme fatigue. In addition, she could not ovulate, she could not have a period, and she could not have another baby. When her doctor put Sarah on pituitary hormone replacement therapy, she eventually regained her fertility and gave birth to a second child.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
<h2 align=center>Assessing Your Gynecological History</h2>

<b>When Are You Most Fertile?</b><br>

<i>Day 1</i> of your menstrual period is<i> the day your period begins</i>. This seems relatively simple, but you wouldn't believe how many people fail to get pregnant because they count the days from the wrong starting point. (Just recently I spoke to a couple who counted from the day her period <i>stopped</i>. They knew she was most fertile around the middle of her cycle, or approximately days 14 to 16, so they timed intercourse two weeks after her period stopped. However, since her period stopped on what they should have counted as day 6, they were having sex a week too late_on days 20 to 22.)<p>
Because on the average a woman's cycle varies in length from twenty-six to thirty-five days, you cannot count forward from day I to find your most fertile days. Since you ovulate approximately fourteen days<i> before</i> your next period begins, you count backward fourteen days from the date you expect your next period will start. That means the woman with a thirty-five-day cycle would ovulate on day 20 or 21 and the woman with a twenty-six-day cycle on day 11 or 12. Since you're fertile for only twenty-four hours each month, these calculations become quite critical.<p>
I use a number of methods to determine the time of peak fertility, but many women, however, can do so by increasing their awareness about their bodies. Around the time of ovulation many women sense a discomfort on one side of their lower abdomen. The feeling associated with ovulation, called<i> mittleschmerz</i>, does not occur in women who do not ovulate_for example, in women taking birth control pills. Also at the fertile time of the month women often notice a <i>clear stringy mucus discharge</i> from their vagina. When your mucus thins out, it allows sperm to swim through the cervical canal. This definitely signals the <i>right </i>time to have sex. I'll discuss other methods you can use to pinpoint your peak fertility in a later chapter.<p>

<b>Cramps and Pelvic Heaviness</b><br>
<img align=left src="usfib.gif">
If you have<i> cramps</i> or take medication for cramps, your doctor needs to know how severe they are. Severe pain at the onset of your period may indicate the presence of endometriosis. If you do not become bloated, do not cramp, and develop only a scanty flow, you may not be ovulating. That's why women who take birth control pills often have less discomfort during their periods. Fortunately ovulation induction treatment is successful for most women.<p>
If you experience<i> pelvic heaviness</i>, you may have large fibroids (non-cancerous growths) in your pelvis. <a href="fibroid.html">Fibroids</a> may also interfere with your ability to conceive and with the ability of your uterus to support an early pregnancy. When necessary, the offending fibroids can be surgically removed and fertility restored.<p>

<b>Menstrual Flow</b><br>

A <i>heavy monthly flow</i> may indicate that too-persistent estrogen production is overstimulating the growth of your uterine lining. A <i>scanty flow</i> may indicate that your body produces too little estrogen to prepare the uterine lining for implantation, or that you have intrauterine adhesions. When estrogen levels are controlled, normal menstrual flow resumes and the quality of the uterine lining improves. When indicated, intrauterine adhesions can be surgically removed.<p>
<i>Spotting</i> during the middle of your cycle may indicate a hormonal imbalance or abnormalities inside your uterus_for example, the presence of scar tissue or an IUD you forgot about. Don't laugh. I once removed an IUD from a patient who had tried to get pregnant for two years. When I extracted the coil she'd received some four years earlier, she was shocked, saying, "But my doctor said I'd passed it!" When the string disappeared, her doctor assumed her uterus had expelled the IUD. In fact, her uterus had "swallowed" the string and concealed its presence for two years. Never assume.<p>

<b> <a href="inclglos.html#Amenorrhea">Amenorrhea</a></b>

"Doctor, I'm not having monthly periods. My husband and I want a baby. What should I do?"<p>
When I hear this complaint, I first establish whether the woman has <i>ever</i> had a period. If she has, then her reproductive tract is patent (intact and open to the outside). If she has never menstruated (primary amenorrhea), I examine her to determine if she has a uterus, if her uterus opens into a vagina, and if the vagina opens to the outside. If the vaginal tract is closed, I can open it surgically and restore fertility. However, if her reproductive organs are missing or severely deformed, not much can be done to correct the abnormalities. If her ovaries are intact, new technologies provide hope that her eggs can be fertilized and nurtured in another woman's uterus. (See <a href="#Hysterectomy">Hysterectomy</a> below.) If I've established that she is not pregnant and has no physical abnormalities, I begin to look for signs of hormonal deficiencies.<p>
<i>Secondary amenorrhea</i>, or the cessation of periods after they've been initiated, is a much more common finding. Secondary amenorrhea may be caused by pregnancy, damaged uterine lining, ovulatory failure, ovarian failure, hypothalamic failure, or pituitary failure. First I determine if your hormonal systems are functioning properly. For example, if your breasts are underdeveloped, if your pubic hair is absent or scanty, or if you have signs of virilization such as a mustache (<a href="incglos.html#Hirsutism">hirsutism</a>) or masculinized genitalia, I'll suspect a hormone imbalance. If I find elevated <a href="inclglos.html#FSH">FSH</a>(pituitary hormone) levels, I'll suspect ovarian failure. (Remember, this is also the sign for testicular failure in men.) Only by performing a complete fertility workup can I identify the reason for your failure to menstruate. Hormone stimulation and replacement therapies are successful in most of these cases.<p>
Because amenorrhea is the most common complaint of women with fertility problems, I've devoted chapters <a href="ch12mb.html">12</a>, <a href="ch13mb.html">13</a>, and <a href="ch14mb.html">14</a> to discussing ovulatory failure and treatment.<p>

<b>D&C</b><br>

If you've had a D&C (dilation and curettage) to scrape out the contents of your uterus, the doctor treating your fertility problem needs to know why. Sometimes a doctor performs a D&C to remove unwanted scar tissue or the remains of an incomplete abortion. Instead of the D&C improving the uterine environment as expected, however, sometimes the procedure will cause the inflamed uterine walls to stick (adhere) together. People with Asherman's syndrome, as this condition is known, usually have regularly occurring, scanty periods. I can correct this condition with a rather simple procedure described in <a href="ch19mb.html">chapter 19</a>.<p>
<b>Traumatic Abortion</b><br>
If a trained physician using sterile procedures performs your abortion, you do not need to worry about compromising your fertility. Illegal, back-alley, and self-induced abortions may lead to life-threatening infection and tubal blockage. Damage to your cervix from a traumatic abortion may also increase your risk for early pregnancy loss. Fortunately these complications occur must less frequently since the Supreme Court legalized abortion.<p>

<b>Spontaneous Abortion and Miscarriage</b><br>

I need to know if you've ever been pregnant, if you've had an elective abortion, or if you've carried a baby to term. A previous pregnancy demon-strates to me that at some point in your life you were fertile. If your present husband fathered a child with you, I know even more_that together you were fertile. That's a very important piece of information, since there is clear evidence that your fertility potential depends on a unique compatibility between you and your partner.<p>
I also need to know if you lost a baby early in a pregnancy. The positive side of a spontaneous abortion or an ectopic pregnancy is that you can get pregnant. The reactions to early pregnancy loss, however, are anything but positive. The couple suffers shock, disbelief, anger, sadness, and grief.
Many women may discard a developing embryo within the first month or so of pregnancy without realizing it. Researchers therefore believe that the spontaneous-abortion rate may be as high as 25 percent. However, if a woman reports repeated abortions, I will want to assess if her uterine lining can support a pregnancy and if her cervix will remain closed throughout the pregnancy. I'll discuss more about correcting these problems in chapter <a href="ch19mb.html">19</a>.<p>

<b>Ectopic Pregnancy</b><br>

If scar tissue blocks the pencil-lead-sized fallopian tube passage (lumen), the tiny sperm may be able to get through but the larger, dividing fertilized egg may get stuck. Entrapped by adhesions, the embryo implants in the tube and continues to grow.<p>
Damage to the inside surface of the tube may also interrupt the fertilized egg's journey to your uterus. Waving like blowing grass, the tiny hairlike cells (cilia) lining the inside of a normal fallopian tube stroke the fertilized egg toward your uterus. When infection or surgery strips the cilia from the walls of your tube, the immobilized embryo may attach itself to the smooth tubal wall.<p>
Unfortunately the condition that damaged one of your tubes very likely damaged your other tube. For this reason, if you have one ectopic pregnancy, you have an increased chance for another one on the opposite side. Years ago women suffering from an ectopic pregnancy often lost the affected fallopian
tube. The job of creating another pregnancy fell almost exclusively to the remaining ovary and tube. Now, however, with early pregnancy detection and microsurgery, we can often save the affected tube and restore it to a functional state.<p>
In the next few chapters I will reveal many more of nature's fascinating secrets and tell you how you can overcome and cope with pregnancy losses.<p>

<b>Did Your Mother Have a Fertility Problem?</b><br>

<i>Quite frequently fertility problems run in families</i>. Therefore, clues from your mother's past may help me unravel a complex mystery. I remember a thirty-year-old woman who came to me after she'd had two miscarriages. She told me her mother had also miscarried twice before giving birth to her. I asked my patient to find out if, in order to avoid another miscarriage, her mother had taken a drug called DES when my patient was in utero. We were both greatly relieved to find out that her mother had not taken this insidious drug. Had she been exposed to DES, my patient could have suffered from unexplained infertility and repeated unexplained pregnancy losses, as well as have a deformed cervix and womb.<p>

<b>Congenital Uterine Abnormalities</b><br>

Congenital abnormalities of the female genital tract range from a simple septum dividing the uterus in half to a complete duplication of all structures_ uterus, cervix, vagina, and external genitalia. Some of these abnormalities may interfere with implantation of the embryo or lead to early pregnancy loss. Surgical correction often improves the chances for maintaining a preg-nancy to term. Sometimes endometriosis can cause a tipped uterus. The tipped uterus, however, is not causing the fertility problem; the endometriosis is.<p>

<b><a name="Hysterectomy">Hysterectomy</a></b><br>

Today women who had previously given up hope of pregnancy because of a <a href="lavh.html">hysterectomy</a> may be able to have their own babies. Using in vitro fertilization techniques, we can surgically retrieve her eggs and fertilize them with her husband's sperm. Since she cannot carry the pregnancy, we deposit the fertilized embryo into a surrogate (substitute) mother's womb. Though born to another woman, the baby will carry its true parents' genes. These exciting prospects are medically possible, and the legal system is grappling with the issues they raise. I'll tell you more about these techniques in chapter <a href=ch21mb.html">21</a>.
<h2 align=center>Contraceptives and Infertility</h2>

<b>Sexual Freedom
</b><br>
Modern contraception, usually regarded as a great success story, may actually be responsible for dramatically increasing fertility problems. The upside of contraception is that women can enjoy sex and still avoid unwanted pregnancies. With the ability to control their fertility and plan their lives, women are making remarkable progress in the educational, artistic, and business worlds. And with the fear of unwanted pregnancy removed, many women enjoy sex with different men. They're glad to see the demise of the double standard.<p>
The unfortunate downside to freely available contraception is that liberated sex has given rise to a rampant increase in sexually transmitted diseases. Every year over 250,000 college-aged women become infertile from chlamydial infection alone. And many of them won't know it until some years later. Whereas women in the past feared unwanted pregnancy, they should now fear pelvic inflammatory disease. I offer no easy answers for the man or woman who wants a free sex life. We do know that barrier contraceptives such as condoms and diaphragms lower your risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections. My hope is that medical breakthroughs will provide a vaccine or some other means for curbing this epidemic.<p>

<b><a href="index.html#Contraception">The IUD</a></b><br>

The IUD, or intrauterine device, particularly exposes the promiscuous woman to an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and tubal damage. Although the exact mechanism of contraception is not well understood, the IUD apparently creates a low level inflammation which prevents the sperm from reaching the egg and an embryo from implanting in the uterus. The IUD string may allow bacteria from your vagina to enter your womb, where they can flourish and invade your delicate reproductive structures. This risk is greatest in the first month following insertion. There's some evidence, though, that copper IUD's and the levonorgestrel containing IUD (Lng-20) may offer some protection against infection.<p>
Since the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease and impairing fertility increases with exposure to different partners, the IUD was temporarily removed from the American market. We now know that the IUD is safe and effective contraception for monogamous women and that the new Lng-20 has many medical benefits.<p>

<b>The Pill</b><br>

 <a href="gopher://riceinfo.rice.edu:70/00/Safety/HealthInfo/gyn/Instructions-for-Pill-Users">Using the Pill</a> won't impair your fertility; however, its use may disguise an underlying fertility problem. I remember when Shelley T. approached me in a panic:<p>
"God's punishing me! I know it!"<p>
"Birth control pills did not <i>cause </i>your fertility problem, Shelley." Once she calmed down a bit I asked, "What were your periods like before you took the Pill?"<p>
"I had terrible cramps," she told me. "But the Pill changed that." <p>
"The Pill may have reduced your cramping, but it did not cure your endometriosis. It's been with you all along," I told her. <p>
The Pill may also artificially regulate women who normally have irregular periods. When their irregular cycle returns after they go off the Pill, these women are often surprised. All the time they took the Pill, they falsely  assumed that it had cured their underlying hormone imbalance. It is true that up to 3 percent of women using the Pill will develop menstrual irregularities as a direct result. However, they usually respond very well to ovulation inducttion therapy. I'll discuss more about the Pill in <a href="ch12mb.html">chapter 12</a>.<p>

<b>Norplant</b><br>
 <a href="index.html#Contraception">Norplant contraceptive implants</a> a six small capsules placed into the upper arm.  They release a small amount of levonorgestrel, a synthetic progesterone each day.  This thickens cervical mucus preventing sperm penetration.  Ovulation may also be blocked. And, if all else fails, the normal preparation of the uterine lining so that a pregnancy may attach is prevented.  Ovulation generally resumes about 2 weeks after a simple procedure to <a href="npt.html">remove the implants</a>. <p>

<b>Lost Years Lower Your Odds</b><br>

Couples who use any contraceptive method over a prolonged period of time have only a few remaining fertile years in which to resolve their fertility problem. To compound the difficulty, their fertility naturally declines as they grow older. However, since women can manage a healthy pregnancy through their late thirties, these couples succeed quite frequently. They just need to pursue their fertility treatment more aggressively.<p>

<h2>Sexual Practices</h2>

<b>Lubricants and Contraceptive Creams</b><br>

A lubricant used during sex may contain spermicidal chemicals that attack and kill millions of sperm before they have a chance to enter the protective cervical mucus. Even petroleum jelly may interfere with sperm activity. The easiest and cheapest lubricant is your own saliva, although bacteria in your mouth may degrade the semen. I suggest that if necessary my patients use a water-based lubricant such as Replens, K-Y Jelly or Lubrifax. If you're in doubt about what product to use, ask your doctor.<p>

<b>Douches</b><br>

If you douche before having sex, you may alter the environment in your vagina and deteriorate the quality of your mucus. Later, when the sperm arrive, your vaginal passage may be hostile and your cervix blocked by mucus that sperm cannot penetrate. If you want to make a baby, I do not recommend douching before sex.
Even though most sperm penetrate your mucus within a couple of minutes of ejaculation, I recommend waiting at least thirty minutes after sex before douching. Actually, unless you have some personal preference for douching, you never need to douche regularly. I'm amazed by the ability of commercial advertisers to make money from our fears about smelling bad or being dirty.
<p>
<b>Timing</b><br>

<i>If you don't have sex, you can't get pregnant.</i> You can quote me on that. You'd be surprised at the number of people who do not have sex the national average of two and one-half times a week. you are fertile for about twenty-four hours each menstrual cycle and sperm can survive in your reproductive tract for twenty-four to forty-eight hours. So you can see that if you do not have sex every forty-eight hours around the middle of your cycle (during your fertile days), you probably will not get pregnant. Some couples prefer using a urine LH kit to predict when ovulation is about to occur. When the stick turns blue, ovulation will likely occur the next day. This means only one day of <i>work-sex</i> and the rest of the month can be for <i>lovemaking</i>. <p>
Many factors can interfere with sex_the couple may be too busy, the husband and wife may travel, they may be under too much stress. During fertility treatment you may need to reduce your activities, alter your business schedules, and even cancel vacations. It doesn't make much sense to spend $300 to $500 in a month to become fertile and then blow your chances because of a trip.<p>

<b>Too Much Sex</b><br>

You know what they say about too much of a good thing.... Seriously, though, extremely frequent sex reduces the amount of sperm available for each ejaculate. We know that it takes about forty-eight hours after sex for a man to build up an adequate supply of sperm. So having sex more frequently than that reduces the man's sperm count so much that pregnancy becomes even less likely. So you'll just have to control yourself_at least until you get pregnant.<p>

<b>Uncomfortable or Painful Sex</b><br>

Uncomfortable or painful sex may indicate infection or other abnormalities. Sometimes, however, discomfort may only be due to insufficient lubrica-tion. If your vagina is consistently dry during sex, perhaps you and your husband should engage in foreplay longer. Stimulating your nipples, clitoris, and other erogenous areas will make your glands secrete natural juices. If your vagina remains dry after sexual arousal, your lubricant-supplying glands may be infected or your hormones may be deficient. You may require low-dose estrogens to improve your vaginal secretions or you may choose to use a water-soluble lubricant. You need to discuss this problem with your doctor.<p>
<b>Aversion to Sex</b><br>

Sometimes sex turns a person off. one particularly sad case comes to mind wheres as a child, my patient had been sexually abused by her uncle. To Donna N. sex was shameful and to be avoided as much as possible, even though she loved her husband.<p>
After she told me about her uncle and her abortion at age thirteen, I referred her for counseling. Although it took some time, her relationship improved to the point where she looked forward to pursuing fertility treat-ment. If sex turns you off, seek professional advice.<p><hr>
<h2 align=center>Your Fertility Treatment History</h2>

 Many couples who come to me already have completed all or part of a fertility workup. They may have been referred to me by their doctor or perhaps they became discouraged and wanted a second opinion. Often they are surprised when I tell them I may need to repeat many of their tests.<p>
However, there are a number of factors I must consider:<p>
 Often the reports I receive for previous tests do not contain all the information I need for proper interpretation. For example, only when I know both the test date and the ovulation date can I evaluate your postcoital test and biopsy results.<p>
 I know and trust my assistants, technicians, and the outside laboratories I use. Due to the lack of standard methodology, many medical laboratories will report different results on the same blood specimen or do not do a good job of reporting sperm morphology on a semen analysis. I remember one instance where a couple came to me after the wife had undergone fertility treatment for over a year. When I repeated the husband's semen analysis, I found severely abnormal sperm. Four months after I treated them with antibiotics and vitamin C, she became pregnant. Since I'm responsible for my patient's care, I want the best information I know how to get.<p>
 While conducting a pelvic exam or ultrasound evaluation, I make many observations that may not be noted on your previous physician's report. I notice, for example, how easily I can manipulate your pelvic organs. If they are stiff and rigid or which area seems to reproduce your pain.  I may suspect adhesions. Subtle clues like flinching when I touch your ovary or kicking when I do your rectal exam help me solve the mystery. I'll also find out if your condition has improved or grown worse since your previous doctor examined you.<p>
 I may need to perform X rays and/or laparoscopies so I myself can view the dye moving through your tubes. The written results of a previous laparoscopy do not tell the whole story. Watching a videotape and seeing the flow and the response of your reproductive organs to manipulation tells me much more, for example, than knowing that you have a tubal blockage. If necessary, I can even lay out a specific plan for performing corrective surgery. I'll discuss the use of <a href="laprscpy.html">diagnostic laparoscopies</a> and X rays in much more detail in later chapters.<p>
People change with time_for better and for worse. Your fertility potential one year ago is history. I must assess your <i>current </i>condition before I can design a customized treatment plan.<p>
When you change doctors, bring your old records on your first visit and, if possible also bring your hospital records, surgical videotapes, laboratory test results and X ray films. By providing these records you may not totally avoid the need for duplicating tests, but you'll minimize your expense and you'll give your doctor an edge on solving your fertility problem Your doctor should use every available clue from your past because considering every factor will give you the best chance for having your miracle baby.<p><h2 align="center"><img src="bluegreline.gif"></h2>
