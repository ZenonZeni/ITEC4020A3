HONEYCOMBS BEEF UP PIPE

A new high-capacity polyethyleneplastic pipe that features smooth interior
and exterior walls is now available from Advanced Drainage Systems Inc.
(ads). Called N-12 hc, the pipe's ribbed walls feature a honeycomb
cross-section. This feature adds ring stiffness which serves both to
maintain the cross-sectional shape during installation and to support the
soil overburden.
The pipe is manufactured in standard 20-ft lengths and 42 and 48-in.
diameters. At just 26.5 lb per ft for the 42-in. size, compared to 680 lb
per ft for a same-sized reinforced concrete pipe, handling and installation
are relatively easy, the company says.
  Pipe ends are fitted with a bell-and-spigot gasketed jointing. Joining
pipe sections involves applying some lubricant to the ends, then pushing
them together. Prior to installation, the company recommends mechanical
compaction of the trench, which helps minimize pipe deflection.
   HDPE pipe is virtually inert and can be used in aggressive environments,
such as landfills and hazardous waste sites. Tight joints and long lengths
provide less chance of contamination of the surrounding soils.
   Because of the honeycomb design, the pipe can be made using much less
material per ft than solid-wall style pipe. In addition, the manufacturing
process that creates the pipe produces no waste products, the company
says.
   James B. Goddard, ADS chief engineer, says it took seven years to
develop the pipe, which the industry practice division of the Ohio Society
of Professional Engineers gave its 1995 new product award. Test
installation of ADS's 48-in-dia pipe was done by the Pennsylvania Dept. of
Transportation. It tested successfully to resist soil pressures equal to
180 ft of fill. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS INC.

AUTOMATIC PIPE ALIGNMENT SYSTEM

Model 5700 series beam aligner is designed for underground pipelaying
applications. The model is equipped with a patent pending automatic
targeting system which is operated by remote control. With the push of a
button, the laser begins to adjust to line center accurately and
automatically, the firm says. This feature allows the operator to reduce
time spent on second day set-ups. It also includes a rechargeable battery
pack that allows for over 20 hours of continuous operation. LASER ALIGNMENT

SMALLER PIPE SIZES

In addition to its existing pipe diameters of 21 to 48 in., the company is
offering smaller solid-wall pipe in 8, 10, 12, 15 and 18 in. dia for
trenchless rehabilitation and replacement projects. The pipe is
manufactured by a thermofusion process utilizing a PVC I-Beam profile
construction for increased strength and durability. These smaller pipe
sizes are suitable for use in sewer system rehabilitation and construction.

STORMWATER CHAMBER SYSTEMS

Offering over 40% more infiltrative capacity in the same length trench as a
24-in. stone and pipe septic leachfield, the Equalizer 24 is designed to
replace conventional 2-ft trench systems. Installers can dig the exact same
length of trench then install the chambers in less than half the time of a
stone and pipe system, says the manufacturer. Features include the
engineered SideWinder sidewall which is bent to attain the maximum
infiltrative surface area. INFILTRATOR SYSTEMS INC.

BORING MACHINES

Designed to help solve small diameter installations problems, the company
offers two solutions. First, for service installations up to 6 5/8-in. dia,
the Push'n Mole pipe pusher works from an excavation area no longer than 5
ft and just 10 in. deeper than the bore. It is powered by a McL-1000
hydraulic power pack or the hydraulics of a backhoe. The unit pushes a
2-in. hole at a rate of up to 5 feet per minute. Second, the Zipper auger
boring system bores from 3 to 12 in. dia. Twin hydraulic cylinders deliver
a uniform on-line thrust of 24,500 lb at 2,500 psi and the auger drive 900
ft lb torque at 2,500 psi. MCLAUGHLIN MANUFACTURING CO.

SUBMERSIBLE PUMP

Designed to meet certain chemical and sewage applications, the CX-400 is a
submersible trash pump capable of moving up to 4,320 gal per hour through
its 2-in. outlet. It can also lift water up to 26 ft above the water
surface. The unit employs a special vortex-type impeller to help minimize
wear and extend pump service life. Other standard features found on the
CX-400 include a bolt-on discharge port, a carrying handle and protection
against thermal overload. Double seals are oil-filled to provide
lubrication and protection, even if it temporarily runs dry. MULTIQUIP

CONSTRUCTION FARED WELL IN 1995

With the fresh release of contract awards data through November, it appears
that construction will ring up a successful 1995. Through the first 11
months of the year, contract awards, excluding residential construction,
were up 8%, according to the F.W. Dodge division of the McGraw-Hill Cos.
Among the strongest annual gains were 24% for manufacturing, 14% for
apartments, 49% for hotels and 10% for educational buildings. Overall,
awards for nonresidential work were also up 8% over 1994's level. However,
there are signs that some of this strength is starting to weaken. ``During
the fourth quarter of 1995, construction began downshifting from expansion
to stability,'' says Robert A. Murray, vice president for economic affairs
for McGraw-Hill's Construction Information Group. ``The industry was able
to avoid declines primarily due to the resilient support of the
nonresidential building market,'' he adds. Markets already showing weakness
compared to 1994 include annual declines of 8% for sewerage, 3% for
bridges, 23% for dams and reservoirs, 18% for warehouses and 27% for
prisons.

ARMY ENGINEERS BUILD BRIDGE IN BOSNIA

Battling winter weather and flooding, U.S. Army engineers successfully
constructed a bridge across the Sava River in Bosnia. The floating bridge
was the largest built by the army since World War II and uses pontoon units
copied from a Soviet system. The 22-ft-long by 26-ft 8-in.-wide aluminum
alloy units are transported folded in half on the longitudinal axis. Each
unit floats on four longitudinal pontoons that are connected to adjacent
pontoons by hinges and pins. The floating bridges provide a 13-ft
5-in.-wide roadway with a walkway on each side. Special units at each shore
are equipped with hydraulic ramps to accommodate bank heights of up to 42
in.

GENERAL ELECTRIC SETTLES WPPSS SUIT

General Electric Co. has paid $134.9 million to the Washington Public Power
Supply System to settle a 1985 suit alleging design errors in the WPPSS No.
2 pressurized water reactor on the Hanford Reservation. The settlement was
sealed by a judge in 1992 and only recently became public, says Anthony
Eitreim, WPPSS attorney. WPPSS sued in 1985, contending design errors cost
the owner $1.16 billion in revenues and 18 months in construction delays.
The settlement required GE to pay costs of boosting capacity of the No. 2
reactor at Hanford by 5%. WPPSS pulled the plug in 1983 on a $5-billion
construction program that was to build five nuclear reactors. Only one was
completed. A request for proposals to demolish the four others, a job
expected to exceed $200 million, will be out in the spring, says WPPSS
spokesperson Mary Ace.

MIAMI LOOKS FOR ALTERNATIVES TO BLUE-CHIP SEWER OVERHAUL
Under state and federal mandates, Miami must spend $1.1 billion to overhaul a
massive sewer system that had been plagued with leaks.  But project engineers
say that regulators are forcing them to build costly improvements that may

ultimately prove unnecessary.

By:
By Andrew G. Wright in Miami


Under detailed and stringent state and federal mandates, Miami is spending
$1.1 billion to rehabilitate the largest wastewater collection and
treatment system in the Southeast. The program, about one-third the way
toward a 2002 completion deadline, has more than doubled monthly water and
sewer bills since 1988, with no expected end in sight.
   To date, Miami has made all 194 milestones in the compliance orders, but
officials claim the decrees are arbitrary in places, putting construction
ahead of planning and forcing costly improvements that may be ultimately
unnecessary. The city wants the federal government to devise a sanitary
sewer overflow policy that considers local conditions, particularly a
groundwater table only 3 ft to 6 ft below the surface and average rainfall
of 60 in. per year. Otherwise, they fear, the massive upgrade will still
not bring the city's wastewater collection and treatment system into Clean
Water Act compliance.
   Wake-up call. The 400-sq-mile system comprises 2,400 miles of gravity
sewers, 640 miles of force main, 874 pump stations and three treatment
plants that together process 320 million gal per day of wastewater on
average. Peak flow tops 700 mgd. Thousands of sanitary sewer overflows,
coupled with a series of pipe and pump station failures in the late 1980s
and early 1990s, caught the attention of media, environmentalists and
regulators.
   After several well-publicized pipe failures flooded intersections
downtown and spilled raw sewage into the Miami River and other bodies of
water, many began to question the integrity of a force main under Biscayne
Bay. The 72-in.-dia Cross Bay line is the primary conduit for wastewater
from the mainland to the 143-mgd Central District treatment plant on
Virginia Key. It was built in the 1950s, when the city was desperately
trying to keep pace with booming development.
   In a 1993 agreement, the Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection
specified replacement of the line with a 102-in.-dia alternative. The job
came in a year early and well under its $72-million estimated cost (ENR
9/12/94 p. 16).
   But the regulators were just getting started. In July 1993, a second
pact with the state specified expansion of two treatment plants, odor
control improvements at the central facility, additional capacity
throughout the collection and transmission systems and expansion of a
detailed infiltration and inflow program already under way.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also stepped in, filing a
federal lawsuit that raised the same issues covered by the state's
regulators. The U.S. Dept. of Justice, representing EPA, refused to
acknowledge the settlement agreements. Miami settled the suit by signing
detailed consent decrees, the first in August 1993, and the second in
February 1995. In addition to signing off on a program currently pegged at
$1.1 billion, the city agreed to spend $5 million to build advanced
wastewater treatment works and install reuse and low-flow toilets in public
housing. Finally, Miami paid $2 million to the U.S. Treasury, the largest
penalty ever collected under the Clean Water Act.
   City officials acknowledge the repairs were overdue. But they also
maintain the settlements with state and federal regulators duplicate
paperwork and put construction's cart before design's horse. A peak-flow
study and system-wide sanitary sewer evaluation, both under way but not yet
complete, would generate a more cost-effective upgrade plan by the end of
next year, they say. The compliance documents are ``clearly a premature
enforcement of the Clean Water Act,'' says Anthony J. Clemente, director of
the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Dept.
   ``We could spend 40% less to achieve the same goals,'' estimates Luis
Aguiar, the department's assistant director in charge of transmission
systems. ``But with the agreements in place, we have no room to
maneuver.''
   EPA's intervention after the state already initiated an aggressive
enforcement program in 1993 ``really was inappropriate,'' Clemente adds. He
suspects the reason may be political, since Attorney General Janet Reno and
EPA Administrator Carol Browner are both natives of South Florida. In any
case, the city says the requirements are overlapping and heavy-handed,
mandating elimination of all sanitary sewer overflows, even though EPA has
yet to develop a national SSO policy. ``Will the regulatory agencies
recognize that all SSOs cannot be eliminated?'' asks Clemente. He adds that
EPA's regional offices do not apply the same standards across the board to
releases of raw or untreated sewage from sanitary collection systems.
   SSO SOS. EPA counters that it is drafting SSO enforcement action
guidelines, giving localities more say in developing management plans,
says Michael B. Cook, the agency's director of the office of wastewater
management. ``We want to reduce monitoring and reporting requirements by
25% within the next year,'' he told the Water Environment Federation
convention last October.
   EPA is ``moving from a technology-based approach toscientific risk-based
analysis on a cost-benefit basis,'' adds Tudor Davies, EPA's director of
the office of science and technology. But he insists, ``I don't believe
there are different quality criteria for water quality standards for wet
weather.''
   Despite EPA's promises of policy changes, the goal in Miami remains
``zero overflows from the collection system,'' says Roy Herwig, an
enforcement officer in the agency's Atlanta office. ``These overflows run
through schoolyards and playgrounds. It's a public health issue.'' He adds
that fragile ecosystems in two national parks within Dade County, Biscayne
Bay and the Everglades, could be compromised by a large-scale failure of
the county's wastewater treatment system.
   Miami has put together ``a tremendous program,'' says Herwig, who adds
that it was long overdue. ``We felt the [operation and maintenance] budget
had been inadequate for years. It's like a car. If you never change the
oil, you shouldn't complain about having to replace a shot engine.''
   Clemente and engineers with Montgomery Watson, the Pasadena, Calif.,
consultant leading program management for the department, say a consistent
SSO policy, considering actual risks and local conditions, would be more
cost-effective. ``You can engineer a brick to fly but it will be mighty
expensive,'' says Ron Ballard, MW program director.
   Expense was also a concern with EPA, says Adam M. Kushner, the Justice
Dept.'s chief attorney on the Miami case. The government filed suit to
protect public health, but also to secure its own investment. Miami had
used $300 million in federal funds to expand its system over the last 25
years, he notes, but spent little to keep it in shape. ``We're working at
the confluence of two principal problems--unstemmed growth that limited
hydraulic capacity and a failure to invest in O&M,'' he says. ``Between
1985 and 1994 we noted between 2,200 and 2,600 overflows system wide,
according to the department's own records. If somebody in Miami even
thought about rain they had an overflow.''
   Observers agree. ``There's no question that they were playing
catch-up,'' says Rick Arbour, president of Rick Arbour & Associates, Inc.,
a Hopkins, Minn., consulting engineer that has advised EPA on Miami's
problems.
   Some of those problems date back to 1973, when the city established a
single metropolitan water and sewer agency that cobbled together a large
system from 30 smaller ones. The clean water law provided federal funds so
Miami and other cities could bring their systems into compliance.
Regulators say officials found it politically expedient to take federal
money for capital expansion, while keeping customer rates low, at the
expense of the existing pipe and pump stations.
   ``Miami had one of the lowest sewer rates in the nation,'' says EPA's
Herwig. In 1988, the city billed $20.64 for average monthly levels of
10,000 gal each of water and wastewater. By 1995, to fund the compliance
orders, the levy had climbed to $44.22--comparable to rates in Dallas and
Orlando, but well below rates in San Francisco, Boston and even communities
in northern Florida.
   Best practice? Underfunding maintenance led to massive infiltration and
inflow in the deteriorating collection system. Compounding this were design
methods regarded as ``best practice'' 20 years ago, but since disproved,
says Aguiar. Oversized force mains caused widespread cavitation and in
several instances blew out manhole covers. Installing manual air release
valves and using certain pipe materials encouraged corrosion instead of
inhibiting it, as intended, he adds.
   In the late 1980s, the system started to break down frequently under
peak flow conditions. The city started an infiltration and inflow
remediation program in 1991, following an agreement with the county.
Extensive inspection of the system, mainly through smoke testing and
televised line inspections, revealed the weak spots. ``We have the largest
TV and grout fleet in the U.S.--16 trucks,'' boasts Aguiar.
   An estimated 40% of the total flow to treatment plants during wet
weather is tied to infiltration and inflow. Still, the condition ``is very
hard to quantify,'' says Aguiar. Some solutions, especially with inflow,
are inexpensive and low-tech. Smoke bombs showed extensive inflow from
missing cleanout caps on private property. The owner is responsible, but
the process--notification and follow-up to secure replacement--costs $250
per site, says Aguiar. It's cheaper and easier to supply crews with $3 caps
and replace the caps themselves.
   Plastic inserts that fit below manhole covers and seal the aperture
during storms are also inexpensive, at $7 or $8 each. Aguiar was first
skeptical these would work, ``but after putting a camera in a manhole
during a storm and watching water just pouring in, I decided to try them.''
The city has installed 55,000 since 1991 and has reduced peak flows during
wet weather.
   EPA wants 20% of the gravity system evaluated annually. Inspection crews
doubled up on repair efforts, which cost 200 to 800 hours per worker in
overtime last year, but ``kept us ahead of the curve,'' Aguiar says.
   Fixing infiltration requires more expensive, longer-term
projects--replacing and repairing pipe. The department is encouraging a
full range of techniques: grouting, sliplining, resin-impregnated liners
and pipe-bursting. Still, says Aguiar, ``this country is way behind Europe
in trenchless technology. We're just picking up on techniques they've had
for 30 or 40 years.''
   Department crews handle trenching pipe of 20 in. diameter or less, and
bid out the rest. Three projects totaling some $64 million are under
construction. They involve 17 miles of force main and interconnections of
lines ranging from 60 to 72 in. in diameter.
   Infiltration and inflow work has cut peak flow to the treatment plants
by 40 mgd and eliminated proposed capacity upgrades for 90 pump stations,
saving $10 million in construction, says Aguiar. But there is plenty of
pump station work in the program. Within the next three years, 358 stations
are scheduled for upgrading, along with construction of 60 miles of new
force main. Estimated cost is $195 million. All 874 pump stations will be
equipped with remote monitoring equipment tied together in a Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition system.
   The consent decree establishes a design criterion for the pump stations
based on a net average pump operating time for each station as 10 hours a
day. ``EPA set forth the 10-hour criteria as a short-term fix,'' says
Rosanne W. Cardoza, MW's deputy program manager. ``The peak-flow study will
show if 10 hours is correct, too much or too little.''
   No time. Post, Buckley, Schuh & Jernigan Inc., Miami, is developing a
digitized model of the collection and transmission system, due next
September, and will deliver the peak flow management study a year later.
``Houston had the advantage of a detailed water quality study that guides
the design of their whole program,'' says William M. Brant, sewer
department deputy director. ``We weren't given time to do that.''
   The study will extract data from the collection model to reach a single
goal: ``to develop a capital improvement plan that will mitigate
storm-induced wastewater overflows in a feasible cost-effective manner,''
says Marc P. Walch, a PBSJ engineer. The collection model will combine data
from the pump stations and force mains to determine how much wastewater the
system can store and transport. The peak flow study will factor in weather
impacts. In a new twist, officials will use a so-called Virtual Rain Gauge.
This computer link to weather data from satellite and ground station
reports can generate accurate storm event data every 15 minutes.
   A geographic information system combines weather information and
collection system data to forecast wastewater flow through the system in a
24-hour interval. As a design tool, it will yield data regarding
transmission capacity, pressure levels at connection points and possible
overflow points within the gravity system, says Walch.
   Miami's upgrade concentrates on the system's weakest link, the
collection system, but treatment plants will also be rehabbed. The
40-year-old central district plant features two parallel process trains
that dewater sludge before discharging treated wastewater 3 miles offshore
through a 120-in-dia. outfall. An 80-mgd pure oxygen activated sludge train
will remain on-line, but a 60-mgd high-rate activated sludge train with
open aeration tanks will be replaced by a second closed-tank pure oxygen
unit for odor control. The other two plants are also slated for capacity
expansions.
   Despite all the work, Miami's troubles with regulators may not be over.
They are now scrutinizing injection wells at the south district plant that
are used for effluent reuse. The 1983-vintage plant, scheduled for upgrade
from 100 mgd to 112.5 mgd, injects treated effluent about 3,000 ft deep
into the Florida Aquifer's boulder zone. This lies several strata and
hundreds of feet below the Biscayne Aquifer--source of Miami's drinking
water. In 1994, a monitoring well in the Biscayne Aquifer detected ammonia,
a possible indicator of treated effluent.
   The department suspects a defective monitoring well. It was capped, but
traces of ammonia have been detected at other points. The department is
negotiating with regulators to develop a remediation program. ``The burden
of proof is on us to prove that we are not the source,'' says Brant.
   The stakes are high, since the south district handles roughly one-third
of the department's sewage. Any alternative to deep injection would be an
expensive proposition for a city already on the hook for one of the most
expensive wastewater treatment capital programs in the U.S.

RECESSION SLOWS CONSTRUCTION

The year 1921 was not remarkable for construction. The recession of the
previous year continued. The value of construction in place for 1921 was $6
billion, down 10% from 1920. In 1921, $1 was worth about $9 in 1996
dollars. But in reaction, deflation occurred. The cost of materials, labor
and borrowing dropped. By year's end, the boom of the Roaring Twenties
began and 1922 would show a 26% jump in volume.
   For lack of private sector confidence in the economy, the bulk of
important construction work in 1921 was in public works, particularly
transportation. The number of trucks on the road, only 250,000 in 1916,
rose to 1.3 million. Most  existing highways and roads had been built for
horse-drawn vehicles and the burgeoning truck traffic was tearing them up.
   One of the highway triumphs was completion of a concrete highway between
New York and Atlantic City, N.J. In November, President Harding signed the
first federal highway bill making $75 million available to the states.
   Crossings. Bids were invited late in the year for foundations for a
suspension bridge linking Philadelphia and Camden, N. J. Now known as the
Benjamin Franklin Bridge, it was the first suspension design by Ralph
Modjeski. Its 1,750-ft center span made it the longest suspension bridge in
the world.
   Work began on the piers for the Belle Isle Bridge in Detroit, a
2,193-ft-long reinforced concrete arch-type cantilever bridge. Construction
was also in progress for a reinforced concrete arch bridge over the
Mississippi River at Minneapolis. It's 400-ft span would make it the
world's longest of its type. And at Fairmount, W. Va., a reinforced
concrete arch bridge crossed the Monongahela River with three
250-ft-spans.
   Buildings. Because of the recession, few buildings of note were erected
in 1921. Perhaps the most impressive was the General Motors office building
on East Grand Boulevard in Detroit. The steel-framed, 15-story building
filled an entire block and had 32 acres of floor space. The Equitable
Building in New York had 40 acres of space.
   In New York, at Broadway and Beaver St., the 30-story Standard Oil
Building was under way. At Broad and Wall streets, a 24-story addition to
the existing eight-story Stock Exchange was using the heaviest trusses and
columns known so far in office building construction.
   Today's growing use of steel-frame houses may have had its origins in a
two-story residence built in Canton, Ohio, with a steel frame.
   Bores. The Hudson River Vehicular Tunnel, subsequently known as the
Holland Tunnel, was the biggest project of the year, but mostly on paper.
Disputes between the New York and the New Jersey tunnel commissions over
the location of a railroad siding at the New Jersey end of the tunnel
stalled construction of the 8,500-ft tunnel for the entire year.
   The Liberty Hills tunnels in Pittsburgh, with double two-lane bores the
largest highway tunnels in the country, were progressing through shale at
the rate of 250 ft per month each.
   Dams. Tieton Dam, at 232 ft the record earthfill dam in the U. S., was
under construction by the U.S. Reclamation Service on the Tieton River in
Washington state as part of the Yakima project. Another distinctive feature
of the dam was its reinforced concrete core wall. The concrete barrier
extends from 100 ft below the river bed to the crest of the dam. It is 5 ft
wide at the bottom, tapering to 1 ft at the crest. Today's Bureau of
Reclamation engineers think the core was built of concrete for lack of clay
in the area. The dam work also includes a 2,200-ft-long, 21-ft-dia
diversion tunnel.
   Wilson Dam, a concrete gravity dam with navigation locks and
hydroelectric capacity, had been under sporadic construction on the
Tennessee River, near Florence, Ala., for three years. Congress decided to
shut the job down. It would subsequently be completed and become part of
the Tennessee Valley Authority operation.
   The Miami Conservancy District's $30.8-million program to prevent more
disastrous floods along the Miami River in southern Ohio progressed. Two of
five dry dams across tributaries of the Miami were completed.

HIGH WAGES, HIGH BUILDING, LONG SPANS

By:
By Joseph F. Wilkinson


Severe inflation plagued the economy and the construction industry was the
source of much of it. Although dollar volume of construction was 7% over
the previous year, inflation caused physical volume to decline. Average
hourly earnings of construction workers rose 20% during the past two years
and in 1970 increases of 15 to 20% were frequent.
   Tubes rise. This was a busy year for tubular design of buildings, in
which the perimeter columns of a high-rise form a theoretical hollow tube
to take the entire wind load. This year there were three extremely tall
tubular buildings under way in Chicago. The tallest of these and of the
entire world was the 1,454-ft-high Sears Tower, a bundle of nine tubes. The
others were the 1,136-ft Standard Oil Building (now the Amoco Building) and
the then world's tallest reinforced concrete building, the 847-ft Water
Tower Plaza. The two World Trade Center towers in New York were also
designed as tubular. Ray M. Monti, construction manager on the World Trade
Center for the Port of New York Authority, was named Construction's Man of
the Year.
   Record spans. The precast concrete box girder bridge, long common in
Europe, made its debut in North America. A 1,990-ft curved bridge of this
type was announced for Nova Scotia's Bear River. The Texas Highway Dept.
would also use segmental construction for the main span and two side spans
of a bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway near Corpus Christi.
   A new method of designing steel highway bridges, load factor design,
promised savings of 10 to 15% in steel.
   In Germany, a box girder bridge on the Rhine River failed while under
construction, killing 13 men. Cracks were also found in the stiffeners of
the five-year-old steel box girder suspension bridge over the Severn River
linking England and Wales.
   In downtown Rio de Janeiro, a 402-ft three-span concrete viaduct under
construction collapsed, killing 24 persons.
   The fastest lift bridge in North America, a double bascule over the Lynn
River in Port Dover, Ont., was supposed to open and close its leave within
30 seconds to accommodate fishing boats. At the inaugural opening, an
official hit the switch and the leaves shot up and kept on going until they
had destroyed their hydraulic systems and their concrete foundations.
   The largest sunken tube segments used so far in the U. S. were creating
a tunnel for Interstate 10 under the Mobile River at Mobile, Ala. In New
York's East River, tunnelers were sinking four-barreled tubes to form a
crossing for two subway and two railroad tracks.
   A methane blast killed 16 men in the trouble-plagued San Fernando water
tunnel, a 5.5-mile link in the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California system. The first 17,000 ft went smoothly, but then miners
encountered 1,400 gpm of water. An earthquake on Feb. 9 also offset the
east portal.
   Clean rivers. The national interest in clean streams and the reluctance
of politicians to vote against pollution control measures produced $1.2
billion worth of sewerage contracts in 1971 and a promise of $1.7 billion
more in 1972. An example of the potential was New York City's North River
Water Pollution Control Plant, which was let for a bid of $228.9 million,
the largest single nondefense contract in the Western Hemisphere.
   In transportation, the Interstate Highway program passed the
three-quarter mark toward its goal of 43,500 miles. And the Defense Dept.
began phasing out the nine-year-old construction program that was carried
out by private construction companies. The $2-billion worth of work
included hospitals, roads, ports, airfields, military housing and depots.

EAGER TO BUILD BUT MATERIALS ARE SCARCE

World War II was over and peace was wonderful for the construction
industry--sort of. Everyone wanted to build something. There was a
construction backlog of $35 billion, with $1 being worth about 10  1996
dollars. But there were hardly any materials or equipment with which to
build. The federal government, which retained its wartime control of
materials and machinery, was intent on providing housing for returning
veterans. Housing received the bulk of material.
   Still, ENR reported construction contracts for $1,846 billion worth of
commercial buildings. That was a jump of 377% over the previous year.
   Excavation work began for the $15-million John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. building in Boston.
   The Veterans Administration early in the year announced a $448-million
program to build 80 veterans hospitals in 39 states over the coming two
years.
   The U. S. emerged from World War II convinced that air transportation
would boom. In May, the Federal Airport Act of 1946 authorized
appropriation of $500 million in federal funds for airport construction.
   Concrete box girder bridges were a novelty in 1946. One was built in
Tacoma, Wash. This was the first full year of work under the Federal-Aid
Highway Act of 1944.
   A world record in hard-rock tunnel driving was claimed when three
eight-hour shifts of tunnelers drove 80 ft through hard granite on the Big
Thompson project in Colorado. Overall, there was a $1.3-billion backlog of
water supply work, but little actual construction was expected until the
next year.
   Los Angeles began construction of a 1-mile-long, 12-ft-dia outfall tube
that would carry the effluent from the Hyperion wastewater treatment plant
to a distant point on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.
   Construction also was in the early stages for Garrison Dam, on the
Missouri River in northwest Nebraska.

BIG BRIDGES AND BIG BUILDINGS COME TO COME TO COME TO COME

The economy was recovering from the Panic of '93, but the public sector
continued to be the most important source of construction work, especially
bridges.
   The most impressive bridge under construction was the record-breaking
steel arch bridge over the Niagara gorge. Designed by Leffert Lefferts
Buck, it boasted a span of 840 ft, making it the longest steel arch.
Overall length for this railway and highway bridge was 1,268 ft. It
replaced a Roebling suspension bridge built in 1868. The bridge was
completed in 1897 and destroyed in 1938 when an ice jam sheared the arch at
the hinges.
   Buck was also the designer of the Williamsburg Bridge over the East
River in New York City, which entered early construction this year. It was
the first large suspension bridge with steel towers.
   The longest reinforced concrete arch bridge in the country was being
built over the Kansas River, at Topeka. It had five spans, the center span
125 ft long and the spans on either side 110 ft long. It was built with a
system developed by Josef Melan in which girders curved to form the arches
were embedded in the concrete.
   The Point Elice Bridge in Vancouver, B.C., a two-span Pratt truss
structure built in 1885 as a highway bridge, collapsed as an electric
railway car crossed. It was May 26, the Queen's birthday, and 55 holiday
passengers plunged to their death in the bay. A coroner's jury blamed the
street railway company.
   A forerunner of today's bridge decks was invented and patented by John
O. Pew, of the Youngstown (Ohio) Iron & Steel Roofing Co. The Pew deck was
made up of a series of galvanized and corrugated iron troughs that were
placed on bridge beams and filled with concrete to a depth of 3 in. above
the trough tops.
   Big dig. The reversal of the Chicago River to protect the quality of
water drawn from Lake Michigan was still the country's largest project, and
excavation work was 77% done. A total of 42 million cu yd of earth and rock
would have to be moved to complete the job. The end product, the 28-mile
Sanitary and Ship Canal, between Lake Michigan and Lockport, Ill., would
divert the sewage-laden Chicago River from the lake to the Des Plaines,
Illinois and Mississippi rivers.
   The link between typhoid fever and polluted water was underlined by a
report in Engineering News that the incidence of typhoid in large cities
was lowest in western Europe where water was filtered and highest where
water was taken from the nearest body of water. Chicago ranked 60 on a list
of 66.
   New York was pulling ahead of Chicago as the builder of skyscrapers.
Under construction in New York was the St. Paul Building, on Broadway below
City Hall, its 25 stories rising to 313 ft. Nearby, the Park Row Building
would have 30 stories and a height of 386 ft, the highest building in the
city. At Broadway and Pine St. the Astor Building was planned for 21
stories and a height of 300 ft.
   Chicago this year pursued area instead of height and completed the
Chicago Coliseum, which had one of the largest single-span steel arch roofs
since the buildings of the 1893 Columbian Exposition. The coliseum, 300x675
ft in plan, had a capacity of 50,000 people, second only to St. Peter's in
Rome, at 54,000.
   Subways. In Boston, the country's first subway system had been under way
since early 1895 and would be completed late in 1897. It was primarily a
cut-and-cover operation, made difficult by a contact stipulation that
two-thirds of Tremont St. and all of the trolley tracks be available from 7
a.m. to 7 p.m.
   In New York, voters approved construction of a subway system in 1894. By
1896, the system was well defined and in the hands of William Barclay
Parsons. Construction would not begin until 1900.
   The Trans-Siberian Railroad, under construction since 1892, was
one-third completed. It would run 4,350 miles from Chelyabinsk, just east
of the Ural Mountains, to Vladivostok, on the Sea of Japan.
   The finishing touches were applied to the Folsom-Sacramento Electric
Plant, a hydroelectric plant in central California that was the first
system to provide long-distance, high-voltage, three-phase transmission for
significant municipal and industrial use. It supplied power to Sacramento,
24 miles away. An important event for construction this year was the
production of the first U.S.-made automobile, the Haynes-Duryea, by the
Duryea Motor Wagon Co. of Springfield, Mass.

LINKED SOFTWARE PREVIEWS CONSTRUCTION

By:
By Matthew Phair


Tiptoeing around patients, doctors and staff during hospital renovation has
always caused big headaches. Now, a computer method that links
off-the-shelf CAD, animation and project-scheduling software is easing the
pain, at least at San Mateo County General Hospital. The method allows the
construction manager and hospital staff to ``see'' construction progress at
virtually any point in time during the schedule.
   The costs avoided by correcting design errors exposed by the method more
than paid for its development costs. Still, most new clients won't go for
it, says the construction manager.
   Software development. Modeling a construction project with CAD provides
``a clear way of communicating [it] to the general public,'' says George
Hurley, a project manager with Dillingham Construction Inc., Pleasanton,
Calif. But the development costs for the software alone can be
``incredible,'' says Pete Reck, an account manager with Jacobus Technology,
Gaithersburg, Md., and former software developer with Bechtel Corp., also
Gaithersburg.
   Trying a different approach, Dillingham contacted the Center for
Integrated Facility Engineering at Stanford University in California to see
if it could successfully tie together less-expensive off-the-shelf
modeling, scheduling and animation software. Using programs from Jacobus,
San Rafael, Calif.-based Autodesk, and Primavera Systems, Salt Lake City,
combined with hundred of hours of data entry, researchers created what one
calls ``4-D'' design--three dimensions plus time.
   Data entry. ``Getting some architects to work in 3-D has been a
struggle,'' says Hurley. To tackle the labor-intensive task of modeling the
$100-million, 200,000-sq-ft replacement facility, Dillingham paid $30,000
to fund the efforts of CIFE members Eric Collier, a student architect and
Martin Fischer, a professor of civil engineering. The two invested 320
person-hours converting 2-D architectural and structural images and data
into detailed 3-D models of the phase-one construction of the central
utility plant, plus another 880 hours modeling the shells of the other
buildings involved in the project. The models, which included over 25,000
objects, were linked to each day of the schedule. ``The costs compare to
building a 3-D [tabletop] model,'' says Fischer.''
   Team members then created animated sequences of the detailed central
plant construction and of the overall six-year construction process. For
this, they used a high-end Silicon Graphics Iris Indigo computer
workstation running Jacobus Construction Animation Toolkit and Walkthru
software programs. The output was fed to a videotape, then showed to the
hospital staff for comment.
   To tackle phase-two construction, Dillingham hired Frank Vaughn, a CAD
technician and designer, to detail a full food service area, including a
new kitchen. Vaughn created the animation and walk-through using Autodesk
3-D Studio software running on a slower Pentium-based computer.
   Error checking. The modeling process uncovered conflicts between the
architect's and structural engineer's drawings. One plan called for a
retaining-wall to be 3 ft tall, while the other indicated 15 ft.
Reconciling it before construction began led to savings that paid for the
research, says Hurley.
   ``A lot of design errors aren't getting caught up front,'' says Vaughn
of traditional work methods. Even if only the 2-D drawings of the
structure, mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems were converted to
3-D, ``hidden problems would be glaringly obvious,'' he adds.
   Dillingham is currently using the modeling process on a wing of a
120-bed, 71,000-sq-ft nursing facility in Martinas, Calif. Doing highly
detailed models of patient rooms has proved helpful, says Tom Trainor,
Dillingham project manager. Equipment that the hospital may purchase, such
as specialized beds, is also modeled in 3-D CAD. The staff can see how it
fits before it's bought, he adds.
   Though the process has paid for itself and helped Dillingham land new
business, it is a big paradigm shift. To many potential customers, ``it's a
tough sell,'' says Trainor.

BUDGET BATTLE DRAWS BLOOD

   As the partial federal shutdown entered its third week, the pain was
spreading in construction.
   The big change came Jan. 2 as the Environmental Protection Agency
started sending out stop-work notices to most Superfund contractors.
Carry-over trust fund money kept cleanups going through the first two weeks
of the current shutdown. But those revenues ran out Jan. 2.
   On that date, the agency furloughed 2,500 Superfund workers around the
country, keeping a small crew of about 80 to manage about 60 EPA-led sites
kept open because of a possible ``imminent threat'' to the public or the
environment. ``We're getting enough funding to provide security to keep out
trespassers'' in the New York region's four Superfund sites where work
continues, says an EPA spokesman.
   Risk. Some Superfund cleanups led by a private companies, states or the
Corps of Engineers also might continue, EPA officials say. But they ``might
be proceeding at their own risk,'' because of the lack of EPA oversight,
says John Frisco, deputy Superfund program director in New York.
   Work was to cease at some 380 EPA-led remediation sites and 70 removal
locations. Another 200 to 400 Superfund sites were in study, design, or
other preliminary stages. ``It's a balancing act,'' says Frisco. ``We want
to make sure we don't shut down projects where there's environmental harm
or where it will take forever to restart.''
   EPA estimates that 10,000 contractor employees will be affected by the
Superfund shutdown. Those layoffs will have a ripple effect, says American
Consulting Engineers Council President Richard Weingardt. ``People will
feel the repercussions when their businesses suffer because engineers are
forced to tighten their belts,'' he warns.
   Camp Dresser & McKee Corp. Inc. received four stop-work notices last
week, says Jonathan Curtis, president of CDM's federal cleanup unit. He
says the shutdowns could also hurt local communities that have gained
economically from cleanup work.
   At EPA, ``virtually all civil enforcement has stopped,'' says an agency
official, so no fines are being collected. ``Polluters are off the hook for
an average daily total of $3 million.'' But criminal enforcement is
continuing.
   EPA also has halted writing regulations, including a proposal to reduce
companies' EPA-related regulatory paperwork by 25%. The agency hoped to
issue that proposal by early January.
   Still, it could have been worse. Key construction agencies such as the
Dept. of Transportation, General Services Administration, Bureau of
Reclamation and Corps of Engineers were open. Granite Construction Co., a
big Watsonville, Calif., heavy-highway contractor, has seen no impact of
the shutdown, says spokesman Michael Lawson.
   Neither has Perini Corp., Framingham, Mass., says Dick Rizzo, executive
vice president for building construction. Payments have been made to Perini
on several federal jobs, he says.

CALIFORNIA SLASHES GOALS

By:
David B. Rosenbaum and Tom Ichniowski

   California continues to dare the federal government to stop the state
from halving its goal for awarding transportation construction dollars to
minority and women-owned business enterprises. The California Dept. of
Transportation has decided to reduce its combined MBE/WBE contracting goal
to 10%, down from 20%, previously the nation's highest. Federal officials
protested in October, and California replied in December. Now the state
awaits another federal response.
   Caltrans' new goal took effect in October and matches the current
federal minimum goal of 10%. But the message in the rollback is more potent
than the fact that the state still meets federal law. California is the
country's most ethnically diverse and populous state. But Gov. Pete Wilson
(R) has made himself the country's most visible opponent of affirmative
action, and had made his opposition the centerpiece of his failed
presidential bid.
   Federal officials remain hamstrung during a continuing legal review of
affirmative action. ``I would say we're not happy,'' says an official at
the Federal Highway Administration. ``Legally, the Supreme Court put us in
a very difficult position.''
   Last June, the court's decision in Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pea
redefined the legal basis for federal affirmative action programs. The
justices ruled that those programs must now meet the same ``strict
scrutiny'' test that state and local programs have had to pass since the
1989 Croson decision.
   Preferences curtailed. In an executive order last June, Wilson sharply
curtailed race and sex-based preferences not required by law (ENR 6/12 p.
8). Wilson's order led to the dismantling of, among other things, the
public-private Caltrans Business Council, established in 1991 to help
Caltrans implement its MBE/WBE programs. To comply, Caltrans set new
affirmative-action contracting goals that took effect in October but only
began receiving attention late last month. ``I think it's very unfortunate
but very consistent with Wilson's objective to eliminate affirmative-action
in the state,'' says Samuel Carradine, executive director of the National
Association of Minority Contractors.
   Last fiscal year, Caltrans awarded about 27% of its nearly $1 billion in
federal-aid dollars to disadvantaged business enterprises, notes Jeffrey M.
Reid, undersecretary of Caltrans' parent agency, the Business,
Transportation and Housing Agency in Sacramento. But meeting those goals
has cost money, Reid adds. In fiscal 1994, Caltrans spent $1.8 million more
by not awarding 30 federal-aid construction contracts to low bidders.
   Today, Wilson and Caltrans intend to expose DBEs to open competition. In
a letter to FHWA, Caltrans Director James W. van Loben Sels says that the
``changes will require that DBEs compete more effectively based on
price.''
   Still, Caltrans plans to leave in effect some local agreements, such as
that reached for the Cypress Viaduct replacement in Oakland, which has a
large minority population. The viaduct collapsed in the 1989 earthquake.
Caltrans agreed to reroute the freeway replacement away from the
residential core of blighted West Oakland. The agency also agreed to award
35% of the freeway replacement project's contract dollars to minority-owned
firms and 20% to locally owned firms. Caltrans' Reid says the agency plans
to honor all existing freeway agreements.

deck on a 4-mile-long viaduct, the agency is prepared to spend up to
$250,000 for conceptual plans for ``alternative construction approaches,
procedural recommendations or innovative contracting mechanisms.''
   But first, interested companies must mail a one-page letter expressing
interest to reach NYSDOT in Albany no later than Jan. 30. The agency will
winnow responses and pay up to $50,000 to each of three to five firms or
teams to present their plans.
   ``It's an excellent idea. Engineers and contractors that have dealt with
similar locations will be able to save the state money,'' says Jerry White,
a vice president with NAB Construction Corp., New York City.
   Bernard Haber, managing partner of Hardesty & Hanover, a New York City
consultant, says it will be important to reduce the length of time that
construction affects the community.
   The Gowanus Expressway, Interstate 278, carries 175,000 vehicles daily,
including 470 express buses during peak travel periods. The deteriorated
steel structure of the 1941 viaduct will be rehabilitated or replaced in a
series of projects expected to total $600 million, says an agency
spokesman, Eric Foster.
   The state agency considered the current preliminary design to be the
best of the alternatives developed by NYSDOT and community and advocacy
groups. It would rebuild interchanges to improve safety and construct a new
deck along with lighting and signs.
   NYSDOT plans to start construction on the highway in 1999 and expects it
to continue for six years. The agency expects to divide construction into
four prime contracts, says Foster.

DOT DISPENSES DOLLARS

   States are getting $220.6 million in discretionary federal
transportation aid, but it's a far cry from the more than $1.3 billion they
requested.
   States sought $649.3 million for work on major bridges in fiscal 1996,
but the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act capped this
year's bridge allocation at $60.5 million and the Federal Highway
Administration only doled out $57.8 million.
   New York received the largest bridge share, $20 million. Half will go
towards a $100-million rehabilitation of a bridge over the Harlem River in
New York City. The city is expected to let that contract in March. The
other $10 million will help finance an $80-million replacement of an
Interstate 287 bridge in Westchester County. That job is expected to be let
in the fall, says a state Dept. of Transportation official.
   Eighteen states sought $687.2 million for Interstate resurfacing,
restoration, rehabilitation and reconstruction (4R) projects. But only six
were winners, gaining a total of $66.1 million.
   Oregon received the largest single award in any category: $25.8 million
in 4R aid to add lanes on I-5's Salem bypass and to upgrade the Hayesville
interchange. ISTEA mandates that U.S. DOT give preference for discretionary
aid to I-5 in Oregon and Washington.
   FHWA also awarded $39.5 million for 31 public lands highway projects in
27 states and the District of Columbia. Oregon again got the largest single
award in that category: $6 million to build an interchange at Chenoweth on
the Columbia River Highway.
   FHWA also granted $14.9 million for ferry boats, $13.4 million for
scenic byways, $9.8 million for timber bridges and $6.6 million for
National Highway System high-priority corridors.

MISSOURI PLANS A NEW MISSISSIPPI RIVER SPAN

   In anticipation of receiving funding approval from the Federal Highway
Administration, the Missouri Highway & Transportation Dept. engaged the
Kansas City, Mo., office of HNTB Corp. to design alternative concrete and
steel girder spans for a cable-stayed bridge with a 1,150-ft-long main
span.
   The estimated $86-million bridge over the Mississippi River at Cape
Girardeau, Mo., will have H-shaped pylons cast in concrete for either deck
design. Tops of the pylons will be 245 ft above the 86-ft-wide roadway.
   HNTB also produced alternative designs in steel and concrete for 1,870
ft of approaches on the Illinois side of the river. Bluffs on the Missouri
side make an approach road unnecessary, says Maury Miller, HNTB's project
manager.
   Since the bridge spans between two states, the Illinois Dept. of
Transportation, along with FHWA, will review the designs says Bill
Stroessner, a consultant design liaison engineer with the Missouri agency's
bridge division. Missouri has asked FHWA for a ``significant amount'' for
the bridge. The two states have not reached agreement on funding, but
normally they would share the balance after the federal contribution.
   Miller says the firm performed dynamic analysis on the bridge to
determine the effect of an earthquake. The area is about 65 miles from the
New Madrid Fault, so HNTB designed for a quake of 8.0 on the Richter
scale.

JAIL TIME FOR STORE'S OWNER

   A three-judge panel convicted 25 people Dec. 27 in connection with the
collapse of the Sampoong Department Store in Seoul, South Korea. The judges
convicted store owner Lee Joon of negligence and sentenced the 73-year-old
to 101/2 years in jail. His son, store president Lee Han-sang, was given a
seven-year sentence for negligence and bribing government officials. Two
local government officials received jail terms and fines and a third was
fined for accepting bribes in exchange for allowing illegal changes to the
five-year-old building.
   The June 29 collapse and subsequent fires killed 501 people, including
31 whose remains never were identified. One of those killed was Frank
Bakes, 58, a senior technical specialist with engineer Burns and Roe,
Oradell, N.J. He was working on a powerplant.
   Two store employees, two designers and a construction company official
also received jail terms for negligence. Fifteen others received suspended
sentences and fines.

FRENCH CONTRACTING GIANT INVESTIGATED

   The chairman of one of the world's largest construction companies,
Paris-based Bouygues SA, is at the center of investigations concerning
alleged illegal political contributions. Police questioned Martin Bouygues,
holding him overnight and searching the firm's main office a week before
Christmas.
   The confidential judicial investigation is believed to deal with alleged
illegal donations of company funds in the late 1980s to pay for campaign
expenses of Michel Noir, Lyon's former mayor. The firm declines to comment
while the case is pending.
   Bouygues, 43, became chairman of the firm in the fall of 1989, on the
retirement of his father, Francis, who founded the company in the early
1950s. One of Bouygues' largest domestic contracts is its share of a
35-year concession to finance, build and operate an almost 6-mile-long
north section of the Lyon ring road, including three tunnels, won in 1990.

MOLTEN METAL SIGNS UP GERMAN SALES PARTNER

   A fledgling U.S. waste disposal firm has formed a strategic alliance to
market its proprietary catalytic extraction process to the worldwide
customers of a major German engineering and construction company.
   Waltham, Mass.-based Molten Metal Technology, Inc. has been a Wall St.
darling since the technology vendor went public in 1992. The company says
its closed-loop disposal system, which subjects industrial wastes to a
3000F molten metal bath, can recover acids and ferroalloys for recycling
while capturing harmful emissions.
   Dortmund-based Uhde GmbH became aware of Molten Metal through ``our
parent company, Hoechst AG,'' says Ulrike Kuske, vice president. Under
terms of the agreement, Uhde will identify and sell at least nine projects
based on Molten Metal's process over the next four years. Uhde's backlog
is $1.5 billion. Molten Metal just recorded its first profitable quarter.
William H. Haney III, president and CEO, expects to break even for the
year.

CBI FINALIZES BUYOUT

   After two months of resisting the hostile takeover bid of industrial gas
rival Praxair Inc., Danbury, Conn., the board of directors of CBI
Industries Inc., Oak Brook, Ill., finally has voted to accept a sweetened
version of the original buyout offer. Praxair says it will sell CBI's
engineering and contracting subsidiary, Chicago Bridge & Iron Co.
   No construction company has publicly revealed an interest in Chicago
Bridge & Iron. One theory is that Praxair will wait until the unit's
backlog builds up before getting serious about a deal. ``We're looking for
the best way to get the most value,'' says a Praxair spokeswoman.
   Praxair made its original bid on Oct. 27, when CBI common stock
(CBI-NYSE) was trading at an annual low of $19 per share. Last month,
Praxair upped its offer for CBI's outstanding stock from $32 to $33 per
share. The increase apparently was enough to sway the CBI board, which had
rejected Praxair's previous offer in November and then tried in vain to
solicit other suitors. Reluctantly, the board voted Dec. 22 to accept the
new offer from Praxair.
   Five senior CBI executives apparently will pocket more than $20 million
in the deal. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the ``golden parachute'' severance payments include $9.6
million for John E. Jones, CBI's chairman and chief executive officer, and
$4.3 million for Lewis E. Akin, executive vice president in charge of the
contracting subsidiary.
   The money is payable when Praxair formally takes control of CBI later
this month. A spokesman for CBI could not be reached for comment on the
potential sale of the contracting unit or the size of the severance
payments payable to CBI executives.

DOE MANAGEMENT SHUFFLE

   In an action widely expected for months, the White House Dec. 27
nominated Scientific Applications International Corp.'s Alvin Alm to take
over the Dept. of Energy's massive environmental cleanup program. Alm, a
director and senior vice president for SAIC's Environmental Business Area,
will replace Thomas Grumbly as DOE assistant secretary for environmen-tal
management. President Clinton Dec. 20 nominated Grumbly as DOE under
secretary, the agency's third most senior position.
   Neither Grumbly nor Alm is expected to face difficulty in confirmation
hearings before the Senate Energy Committee. Just how quickly the
nominations will proceed is an open question. Over the past year, DOE
Secretary Hazel O'Leary has been heavily criticized on Capitol Hill on
issues ranging widely from the administration's position on nuclear
civilian nuclear waste disposal to per-sonal spending on overseas travel.
   Sen. Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat who has often expressed displeasure
with O'Leary, has blocked Clinton's nominee for DOE assistant secretary for
congressional, intergovernmental and public affairs since late summer.
   Prior to joining SAIC in 1989, Alm was the CEO of Alliance Technologies
Corp. and served as the board chairman and CEO for Thermal Analytical Corp.
From 1983 to 1985 he was the deputy administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   In 1970, Alm was the first staff director of the Council on
Environmental Quality and in 1973 became EPA's assistant administrator for
planning and management.
   Alm's confirmation would clear the way for his second stint at DOE. In
1977, he served as assistant secretary for policy and evaluation. Alm now
serves as cochairman of DOE's Environmental Management Advisory Board and
is on the board of the Energy and Environmental Policy Institute.
   Grumbly has headed DOE's environmental management program since 1993. He
leaves Alm a $6-billion-a-year program that continues to come under
pressure from Congress and the administration to cut costs. Although the
program largely escaped deep spending cuts proposed by the House last year,
it is certain to come under still more scrutiny from congressional budget
cutters this year. Grumbly will retain primary oversight of DOE's
environmental, waste management and nuclear material disposition issues.

TEXAS ENGINEERS WIN BANGKOK SEWER WORK

   A group of Houston engineering firms and tunneling contractors is the
first U.S. team to win a contract for a $2-billion sewerage expansion
program in Bangkok, Thailand. The venture edged out ten teams of
international competitors to win as low bidder on the $192-million award to
design, build and operate two new wastewater treatment plants and a
collection system.
   The joint venture of Pate Engineers Inc. and Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam
teamed with tunneling specialist BHR-Garver Inc. and ST Environmental
Services was awarded the four-year contract by the Bangkok Metropolitan
Authority. The group has a Thai contracting partner, Premier Enterprise
Public Co. Ltd. The contract is the third of eight that will eventually be
let in the city's 12-year program to upgrade wastewater treatment
facilities for its 12 million residents.
   Other U.S. firms participated unsuccessfully. Brown & Root Inc.,
Houston, teamed with Thailand's Sino-Thai Engineering & Construction Co
Ltd. CH2M Hill Cos., Denver, joined a team of Thai and Korean firms and
France's Soletanche Enterprise. Earth Tech, Long Beach, Calif., bid with a
Thai construction partner as well. Waste Management International and the
London-based unit of Rust International Inc., Birmingham, also competed.
   ``This is a very important move for us,'' says Gerry Pate, Pate
Engineers president. ``We've been trying to go overseas for four or five
years now.'' He says Garver was already prequalified by the Thais, having
been on bidding teams for two previous contracts.
   The treatment plants will have a total capacity of 220,000 cu m per day,
with deep tunnel and open-cut sewer lines totaling 60,000 m and pipe sizes
ranging from 500 to 2,300 mm in dia, say team officials. One of the three
plants will be a stacked, multilevel facility on a tight site. Under
separate contract, British engineers are designing a similar treatment
plant on a tight site in another part of the city (ENR 10/16/94 p. 21).
   LAN President James Cole says the next sewerage contract is expected to
be advertised in March with bidders prequalified by July.

OCCIDENTAL REPAYS COSTS FOR LOVE CANAL CLEANUP

   The U.S. government has ended one of its longest and most high-profile
environmental disputes with a ``responsible'' polluter. Occidental Chemical
Corp. agreed Dec. 20 to reimburse the government $129 million to cover
cleanup costs at the Love Canal Superfund site in Niagara Falls, N.Y. It is
the largest Superfund settlement to date.
   Under a consent decree in U.S. district court in Buffalo, Niagara
Falls-based Occidental will repay $101 million to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, which funded and directed cleanup of residential
properties between 1978 and 1989. A leachate management system remains in
operation. Another $27 million will go to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, which handled emergency cleanup actions before the Superfund law
was enacted in 1980. Occidental, which also agreed to pay $375,000 to
federal agencies for natural resource damages caused by dioxin release,
``just did a turnaround,'' says an EPA source.

PLAN WOULD REVIVE AREA AROUND WHITE HOUSE

   Acomprehensive design process aims to turn the run-down area in front of
the White House into America's ``town square,'' possibly including
educational and commercial uses. But there is no firm plan or cost
estimate.
   A 13-member panel, mostly architects, brainstormed in Washington, D.C.,
for several days last month to develop ideas for the two blocks of
Pennsylvania Ave. in front of the White House and the surrounding
neighborhood. They considered more than 600 suggestions received from the
public after the area was closed to vehicular traffic last May for security
reasons.
   Although the group did not propose a specific plan, its report set forth
nine guiding principles, including retaining Pennsylvania Ave. as a
ceremonial public way, expanding the site as a national park to encompass
some adjacent properties and enhancing the connection between the park and
the rest of the city.
   The final plan could also serve as a much-needed shot in the arm to a
slumbering downtown. An active town square could ``bring life to
downtown,'' says architect M. David Lee, a principal with the firm of Stull
and Lee, Boston, and a panel member.
   The National Park Service, which assembled the study panel, will develop
alternatives to be unveiled in spring. The final plan is expected to be
presented next January.

S.F. GIANTS SET TO TRY AGAIN

   The San Francisco Giants have struck out many times trying to find
somewhere to play baseball other than in windswept, chilly 3Com Park
(formerly Candlestick Park). The team is now seeking approval for a new
$255-million plan unveiled Dec. 21. If the Giants succeed, the team will
try to become the first to build a privately financed major league ballpark
since Dodger Stadium in 1962.
   The Giants propose it for 13 acres on San Francisco Bay, close to
downtown and public transportation, in one of the sunniest areas of the
city. Plans drawn up by Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum's sports designers in
Kansas City, Mo., emulate HOK's designs for completed new urban ballparks
in Denver, Cleveland and Baltimore. For the Giants, HOK's plans call for
only 42,000 seats, far fewer than the 70,207 in 3Com Park.
   The Giants still need approval for an exemption to waterfront height
restrictions. Opponents protest walling off the waterfront and encouraging
more traffic and parking in the area. The stadium plan ``has the basic
problem of violating the 40-ft-height limit on the waterfront,'' says
Norman Rolfe, a board member of San Francisco Tomorrow, an urban planning
group. Still, San Francisco supervisors may put the matter on the March 26
ballot.
   Bay Area voters have snubbed the Giants' various ballpark proposals
before: four times since 1987. ``We have listened carefully to the
suggestions of San Francisco residents, and have developed an innovative
private financing plan which is truly responsive to their wishes,'' says
Peter A. Magowan, the Giants president and managing general partner, in a
Dec. 21 release. That plan counts in part on tax breaks and revenues from
63 luxury suites and 5,200 club seats.
   The National Football League's 49ers also wants to vacate 3Com Park. By
1999, it will undergo an estimated $26-million upgrade, financed in part by
the Bay Area computer company whose name it currently bears.

SOGGY SITE TESTS THE LIMITS

By:
Paul Kemezis


   Exposed slurry trench wall in powerhouse excavation is called the
tallest of its type in the world.
   Constructing a new powerhouse and channel in a narrow strip of land
between an existing dam and an abandoned river course required two large
slurry trench walls. Workers then excavated between them. But installing
the walls was one of the largest jobs of its type anywhere.
   The parallel structural slurry walls range from 50 to 130 ft deep. They
are heavily reinforced and the largest panels are tied back with large
tendons, says Jayant N. Sheth, senior structural engineer for the
Benham-Holway Power Group, Tulsa, designer of the project. Geotechnical
input is by the Denver office of Woodward-Clyde Consultants.
   ``We believe it is the highest exposed concrete slurry wall ever built
in the world,'' says Kenneth D. Hansen, senior water resource engineer in
Englewood, Colo., for the Portland Cement Association. ``It shows how high
a slurry wall can go if you use the right design.''
When the Army Corps of Engineers built navigation and recreation Dam No. 2
on the lower Arkansas River in the 1960s, it diverted the flow to a new
channel. So when the Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp., Little Rock,
decided to install a $192-million 108-Mw powerhouse at the dam near Nady,
Ark., it had only the narrow strip of land to work with. The three-unit,
low-head power station will be founded 100 ft below grade in a highly
plastic clay layer, Sheth says.
   Designers first considered using roller-compacted concrete gravity
sections for the walls, but decided slippage on the clay base would cause
too many problems. Instead, they specified a perimeter slurry trench cutoff
wall to permit dewatering, with the thick structural slurry walls placed
within it.
   French contractor Soletanche Inc. used two machines with rotating cutter
heads to dig down into the clay layer for the cutoff wall around the entire
site. It totals 584,000 sq ft of plasticized concrete, which reached a
compressive strength of 200 psi in seven days. That work helped Soletanche
formulate a mix for the main slurry trench walls, which had to achieve
4,000-psi strength in 28 days.
   The 258,000 sq ft of structural walls consist of 152 panels as thick as
3 ft, says Sheth. More than half of them are T-shaped to provide better
anchorage in the soil. The larger panels will be structurally integrated
with the powerhouse side walls. They are connected by a cap beam and tied
to a deadman wall set back 113 ft using 132 tendon anchors with tensile
strengths ranging up to 1.8-million lb. Smaller panels are tied back by 302
ground anchors with 600,000-lb tensile strength. They will be removed after
construction.
   Hansen calls the safety features--dewatering to ease hydrostatic
pressure and the complex anchoring system-- ``fairly daring.''
Record rebar. Soletanche worked around the clock for four months to dig the
trenches. It had rebar cages assembled that weigh as much as 70 tons and
are as long as 130 ft. Sheth calls that a record. A three-crane array
lowered them into the trenches. In total, 3,500 tons of rebar were
fabricated and placed during a three-month period.
   Slurry walls have been completed and excavation of 3 million cu yd of
soil is under way. J.A. Jones Construction Co., Charlotte, N.C., will begin
building the powerhouse early this year. Once the new channel and
generating station are in place, equalizing hydrostatic pressure, the
perimeter cutoff wall will be removed.
   The design also had to account for possible heaving and settling of the
clay base layer in a range of 3 to 4 in. during excavation and powerhouse
construction, says Sheth. The builders have installed a sophisticated
monitoring system to track the impact of those movements on the walls.

ISOLATORS PASS TEST OF TIME

By:
David B. Rosenbaum


   Ever since the 1985 completion of the nation's first base-isolated
building, there have been lingering doubts about the long-term stability of
the high-damping rubber used. Newly disclosed test results encourage
confidence in its performance. But questions remain about the ability of
isolators in general to hold up under near-field effects and so-called
seismic fling--the large displacement pulses in a major quake's initial
seconds.
   The first U.S. installation at the Foothill Communities Law and Justice
Center in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., was the largest for its time. The
170,000-sq-ft building owned by San Bernardino County has five stories
sitting on 98 isolators; a 16-in. gap separates the below-grade first story
from the exterior retaining wall. That gap permits the isolators to shear
horizontally 16 in. Installed beneath columns, they have horizontal layers
of steel and high-damping rubber, and are 30 in. in diameter and 18 in.
tall.
   Last August, workers jacked up the building for $20,000, removed two
isolators and temporarily replaced them with the original prototypes
tested in 1983 (ENR 9/11/95 p. 24). James M. Kelly, the structural
engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley who
supervised the original prototype testing, oversaw the recent testing of
the production isolators as well. ``There's always been a lot of questions
about the mechanical characteristics of rubbers,'' he notes.
   Testing of the two production isolators took place last fall at the same
place where they were manufactured, a factory now run by Furon Structural
Bearings in Athens, Texas. ``I tried to make everything exactly what it was
before,'' Kelly says. ``The tests demonstrated that the material has
long-term stability and doesn't change its mechanical characteristics over
time and doesn't change under load.'' Kenneth A. Taylor, San Bernardino
County's project manager, says, ``That was something that had not really
been known up until this time.''
   Still questionable. Base isolators have been installed under more than
20 buildings in the U.S. and about 100 in Japan, as well as in Italy and
New Zealand. The cost premium--if any--depends on the comparisons; isolated
structures generally cost more but perform better than conventional
construction. Compared to conventional construction, base isolation
generally costs 3 to 6% more, Kelly figures, but ``turns out to be
cheaper'' for meeting equivalent performance standards.
   But performance remains uncertain. The largest quake yet to affect a
base-isolated structure--the relatively moderate 6.9 quake devastating
Kobe, Japan, last year--struck about 15 miles from the closest isolated
building.
   San Bernardino County's justice center is designed for 0.7 g of ground
acceleration, but has not experienced more than 0.3 g, points out Hodge C.
Gaines, president of Taylor and Gaines, Pasadena.
   It engineered the building before the 1991 introduction of provisions
for isolation in the Uniform Building Code. Based on geotechnical studies,
T&G designed isolators to shear a maximum of 16 in. for major quakes on the
San Andreas fault 131/2 miles away and the Sierra Madre fault zone less
than 2 miles away.
   It remains debatable whether that 16 in. suffices. One of the most vocal
critics of current base-isolation methods is John Hall, a civil engineering
professor at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. In its
Engineering & Science magazine last summer, he wrote, ``the near-source
motions being used in the design of base-isolated buildings could be too
small, and the resulting buildings may not, in fact, be
`earthquake-proof.'''
Kelly intends to issue a paper in response soon. And early this year he
intends to publish the results of his recent isolator tests.

LIGHT TRAFFIC CHILLS DULLES DEBUT

By:
By Tom Ichniowski


When Transportation Secretary Federico Pea helped open the Dulles Greenway
Sept. 29, he presented a horseshoe to the private road's chief executive,
Michael R. Crane. Crane will need much good fortune, and a lot more riders,
if his $330-million project is to succeed. The Greenway so far has drawn a
disappointing average of 10,500 daily travelers, well short of the 34,000
its owners projected by the end of the first year of the road's operation.
   The project's slow start has already raised questions about the future
of private toll roads just as another opens to traffic. The $126-million
State Route 91, ten miles of toll lanes built into the middle of an
existing freeway in Orange County, Calif., opened Dec. 27. Officials there
will not disclose how many drivers are using the new lanes.
   The Dulles Greenway's difficulties are being studied as examples of
mistakes to avoid, even by those who believe the Greenway will eventually
reach its projected volume. In particular, toll road and transportation
officials believe the Greenway has been hindered by its lack of a marketing
study, consumer-oriented advertising and peak and off-peak pricing.
   Consumers. ``We have to understand these projects are a consumer product
and we have to have research and marketing,'' says Adeel Lari, director of
Minnesota's Dept. of Transportation's Alternative Transportation Financing
program. ``The lack of marketing may make it start slower.'' Crane says he
is discussing volume discounts for local employers, peak and off-peak
pricing, and strong marketing to draw more patrons.
   The Greenway charges a flat $1.75 toll all day. State Route 91 in
California uses peak pricing. The toll is as low as 25 cents in the
off-peak 7 p.m. to 4 a.m period and as high as $2.50 in the 5 a.m. to 9
a.m. rush hour.
   So far, traffic on the new lanes of State Route 91 is ``light,''
according to a spokesman for Granite Construction Co., Watsonville, Calif.,
a partner in the venture. The spokesman attributes the light traffic to the
holidays.
   Pricing is seen as a problem for the Dulles Greenway, where drivers have
resisted paying even though they get a brand-new traffic-free road. ``I do
think developers will have to be very sensitive to the price that travelers
are willing to pay for convenience,'' says one federal transportation
official.
   ``I think everybody was expecting perhaps a faster buildup,'' says
Mortimer L. Downey, deputy secretary of the U.S. Dept. of Transportation.
Downey says the project's traffic will exceed ``their break-even point''
after some time has passed and drivers test it out.
   Crane concedes that the results have been disappointing. But he still
thinks he can hit the traffic target by next fall. The project's primary
lenders ``were very supportive of the project and felt very strongly
traffic could achieve the end-year numbers.'' He says he doesn't foresee a
foreclosure, but he won't rule out refinancing, either.
   Crane's family owns 57% of the partnership that controls the toll road.
It stands to gain or lose the most. Crane's mother, Magalen O. Bryant, and
her family-owned investment company, Lochnau Ltd., gradually increased an
initial investment of $15 million to $68 million as the project team
struggled to find lenders and other investors through 1993. The project's
institutional lenders are led by CIGNA Investments, Prudential and John
Hancock. The project's financing closed and construction began in September
1993. At that time Crane said that he was looking to sell off a substantial
portion of Lochnau's interest.
   The 14-mile-long project extends an existing toll road and connects
Washington Dulles International Airport with Leesburg, Va. Existing roads
already are congested. Traffic projections were prepared by Vollmer
Associates, New York City-based engineering consultant. Company officials
could not be reached for comment on the toll road's slow start.
   ``The traffic has been lower than anticipated, but [that's] not unusual
for a toll road startup,'' says Barbara Johnson, spokeswoman for Brown &
Root, Houston, the prime contractor and 13% owner of the Greenway. ``We are
seeing signs of slow improvement.'' After the Crane family's 57%,
Autostrade SPA of Italy holds the biggest stake.
   Brown & Root, the prime contractor, finished its portion of the work six
months early with no overruns, says Johnson. But the automatic vehicle
identification system is not yet in place. Crane expected the technology to
be ready by first quarter of this year, but now says he's not sure it will
be done by then. He cites ``problems with state procurement.''
   Crane says he would invest in other toll roads and has formed a firm to
advise on other jobs. But he has learned lessons. ``I would never do it the
same way. I would never do it as a totally private toll road. I would do it
as a public-private venture,'' with a state or Uncle Sam as partner or
guarantor.

SEATTLE MULLS PRIVATIZATION

By:
By Stephen Daniels, with Debra K. Rubin


The City of Seattle's planned construction of a 120-million-gal-per-day
drinking water filtration plant, the first phase of a $1.2-billion, 10-year
capital improvement plan, is likely to be watched closely by other U.S.
cities. The plant could become the largest design-build-operate drinking
water facility on the American mainland.
   Proposals are due this week for a consultant to help the city develop a
request for proposals for a DBO contractor for the Tolt Filtration Plant,
to be located on the Tolt River's south fork. The river provides about 30%
of drinking water for the central Puget Sound region. The plant, the
largest project undertaken to date by Seattle's Water Dept., would cost $93
million to $103 million under a traditional design-build approach. The city
expects to save between 10 and 15% of estimated construction costs using
DBO. A 20-year operating contract would cost an additional $60 million,
says Michael Schaefer, the city's capital improvement program analyst.
   Seattle is one of six major U.S. cities now using unfiltered rivers as
primary drinking water sources. It is turning to filtration to comply with
more stringent federal drinking water regulations. The proposed plant, and
another on the other major supply source--the Cedar River--also would
improve reliability of Seattle's drinking water system. Recent heavy rains
cut off the Cedar River supply because of storm-caused sedimentation.
   The project is already sparking interest among firms eager to push
privatization in the U.S. ``There have been a lot of smaller projects, but
nothing of this scale,'' says Jimmy W. Otta, vice president of CH2M Hill
Cos., which has a joint contract with Montgomery Watson, Pasadena, Calif.,
for the plant's predesign. ``A lot of people have been waiting for this
kind of project. There will be a lot of competition.''
   In October, Puerto Rico awarded a $300-million DBO contract for a new
filtration plant and 50-mile pipeline to a consortium of the London-based
Thames Water International, Dick Corp., Pittsburgh, and Malcolm Pirnie
Inc., White Plains, N.Y. It is set to take effect by month's end, says a
Pirnie official.
   While Seattle is ``still not absolutely committed to DBO,'' says one
contractor executive, the winner of the $800,000 RFP preparation contract
will assist municipal officials in comparing costs of privatized and
traditional approaches for the filtration plant. A DBO contract could be
awarded in early 1997 with the facility targeted for completion by 2001.
``The market is telling us it's ready,'' says Schaefer. ``It will be
challenging to see if this works within the U.S.''
   Seattle hopes to create design and operating efficiencies by creating
consortiums that will bring designers, builders and equipment manufacturers
together early in the design process. ``We have been told by firms
interested in bringing this model to the U.S. that this could well be the
first of many such projects in the U.S. and that they may forego immediate
profits on this job in order to create a market niche,'' says Schaefer.
   ``The interesting thing here is the operations component. There aren't a
lot of firms in the world with the capability to operate a plant like
this'' says Otta. ``We are seeing a lot of people who never talked to one
another before forging partnerships and alliances.''

BUDGET MESS STALLS OTHER BILLS

By:
By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie Winston

Several major construction bills are on the slow track as Congress awaits
the outcome of high-level budget negotiations.
   As the 104th Congress moves into its second session this month, there is
no progress on any legislation, says Dana Thompson, Sheet Metal and Air
Conditioning Contractors National Association director of political
affairs. ``Everything is sitting tight'' until the budget crisis is
resolved, Thompson says.
   The House has passed a rewrite of the Clean Water Act, including a new
system for categorizing wetlands. Those wanting to dredge wetlands judged
most valuable would have to avoid, minimize or mitigate damage. But the
Senate had just begun hearings on its version as 1995 ended.
   The picture was nearly reversed on the Safe Drinking Water Act. The
Senate cleared its reauthorization bill, with provision for a new state
revolving fund. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee leaders
introduced an SRF bill. But the House Commerce Committee, which has prime
jurisdiction over drinking water, did not produce a bill with regulatory
provisions.
   If the final budget reconciliation measure extends Superfund taxes, that
would remove what steam is left in reauthorization proposals, at least for
now. The big sticking point with those proposals is the high cost of
eliminating pollution liability retroactively.

STATES SEEKING TRANSPORT BANKS

By:
By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie Winston

The Dept. of Transportation is seeking applicants for newly authorized
state infrastructure banks. The National Highway System Designation Act
permits up to 10 state or multi-state banks. In the Dec. 28 Federal
Register, DOT says it will take applications until 10 banks are approved.
None will be designated before Jan. 29.
   ``There are several states that are quite interested,'' says Deputy DOT
Secretary Mortimer L. Downey. ``The one thing that tends to put them off a
bit is they say: `Where's the new money.'' He adds, ``We say, `No, no,
there isn't any new money. This is a way to try to make your money go
further.''
   Downey says states will have to reprogram other exist-
ing aid to launch the banks. ``There are some who definitely want to do
that,'' he says. Among those DOT is talking to are Ohio, California, and
Florida.
   Banks can use federal aid for infrastructure loans, interest-rate
subsidies, reserves for bond or debt financing, or in other ways to stretch
the money.

INJURY RATE FALLS FOR CONSTRUCTION

By:
By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie Winston

Construction has recorded its lowest injury rate in 20 years and for the
first time the industry's injury rate dipped below the level for 
manufacturing. That good news came in a Bureau of Labor Statistics report
covering 1994 data.
   But Bradley Sant, director of safety and health for the AFL-CIO Building
and Construction Trades Dept., says proposed safety standards shouldn't be
moved to the back burner. Sant says the construction injury rate remains
high. He argues it is important to move forward with a revised standard for
scaffolding as well as a new permit-required confined space standard.
   The BLS annual survey on Workplace Injuries and Illnesses, released last
month, reports there were 11.8 incidences of injury and illness for every
100 full-time workers in construction. That compares with a 12.2 rate in
manufacturing. The construction data are a vast improvement from 1974 when
the rate was 18.3.

ABC PUSHING FOR ANTI-SALTING BILL

By:
By Tom Ichniowski and Sherie Winston

Determined to counter a recent Supreme Court decision that gives the green
light to ``salting'' practices, the Associated Builders and Contractors is
working with members of the House and Senate labor panels to write
legislation to prohibit the practice. But any such bill is sure to face
vigorous opposition from labor unions.
   ``We're still under active negotiation'' to draft a bill, says Charles
Hawkins, ABC senior vice president. Negotiators are being careful only to
address salting and not reopen the National Labor Relations Act, Hawkins
says.
   One possibility would be to change the NLRA definition of ``employee.''
Hawkins says, ``Our timing [for a bill to be introduced] is within four to
six weeks.''

THE TOP 25 NEWSMAKERS OF 1995

Many people in many ways serve the best interests of the construction
industry. The editors of ENR have chosen these 25 for newsmaking
achievements covered in the magazine last year. All of those cited on this
page and the next will be honored at a Feb. 15 dinner at the Plaza Hotel in
New York City. One of them has already been chosen to receive the Award of
Excellence, ENR's top honor. That person will be the subject of a cover
story in the Feb. 19 issue.
   Working in the nightmarish aftermath of April's terrorist bombing in
Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people, structural engineer David J.
Hammond of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Jerry Ennis of Oscar
J. Boldt Construction Co. led a heroic effort to stabilize the teetering
remains of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Their tireless
work kept the remnants of the reinforced concrete office building, its guts
ripped open and major sections dangling precariously, standing for more
than a month so that rescuers could search for survivors, and crime scene
investigators for clues.
   As leader of a research team that perfected an extrusion process,
Surendrah Shah, professor of civil engineering at Northwestern University,
developed a low-cost manufacturing process for creating high-strength,
bendable cement-composite building products. The process uses machinery
that can produce sheets, pipes, rods and structural shapes but costs 75%
less than existing machines that can only make sheets.
   Proving that an engineering firm with fewer than 30 people can push the
envelope, Myers Nelson Houghton Inc.'s David L. Houghton and his team
devised a joint that resists the kind of cracking in steel moment-resisting
frames (SMRFs) triggered by the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Calling for
side plates with fillet welds, the patented connection is the first
post-quake SMRF joint to meet requirements of California's stringent
oversight agency for hospital construction.
   For an 18,000-sq-ft library with an exposed wooden truss system,
architect Eliot W. Goldstein set a new standard for heavy timber structure
as architecture. Facing skyrocketing lumber prices, he reworked the design
to transform the two-dimensional frame into a more efficient
three-dimensional structure, akin to a timber space frame. In doing so,
Goldstein sliced 35 tons of lumber from the $4-million building and added
more visual interest. He also produced an instant landmark for New Jersey's
Montville Township.
   Improving on a technique used mostly in Europe, Stephen Blaisdell of
Cianbro Corp. and construction engineer Craig Finley of Finley McNary
Engineers Inc. suspended formwork on prestressed tendons to cast, without
falsework, arch ribs over the Presumpscot River in Maine. Cianbro was able
to cast the spandrel piers while constructing the arches. The method cut
cost and schedule from critical in-river work.
   Gamil Tadros, formerly with Stanley Technology Group, and Gerard
Sauvageot of J. Muller International developed and refined precast
components weighing up to 54,000 tonnes for 44 gravity-base piers on
Canada's Northumberland Strait Crossing. The piers minimize marine work on
the 12.9-kilometer bridge and enable the contractor to set long girders to
tight tolerances on elevations and alignment.
   New York City engineer Shawn Disney developed an innovative plastic pier
that simultaneously solves two pressing environmental
problems--deteriorating wharves and mounting garbage. The 410-ft-long pier
has piles, beams and decking made entirely of recycled plastic, which is
impervious to marine borers. Disney's solution offered a sound and durable
alternative to wood and recycled the equivalent of 13 million milk
containers.
   L.T. Huynh of DORIS Development Canada Ltd. headed the team that
designed the first large concrete gravity-base offshore structure built in
North America. The monumental base is surrounded by an innovative ice wall
to protect the Hibernia oil production platform from North Atlantic
icebergs. Robert Elliott, civil construction manager for Norwegian
Contractors Newfoundland Inc./Peter Kiewit Sons Co. Ltd., successfully
slipformed the complex shapes.
   Steel erector Larry W. Davis, formerly of Canron Construction Corp.,
ultimately proved correct an audacious strategy to construct a platform for
a 12-story addition to New York Hospital spanning Manhattan's busy FDR
Drive. Davis developed a scheme and a special rig to lift prefabricated
truss platform sections weighing as much as 830 tons each from Hudson River
barges to the hemmed-in site. Platforms were placed with pinpoint accuracy
despite rough waters and freezing temperatures.
   Anthony Scardino, executive director of the Hackensack Meadowlands
Development Commission, led development of a unique land use strategy for
the New Jersey Meadowlands to permit development in the neglected but
economically strategic 32-sq-mile area without sacrificing fragile
wetlands. The effort will spur new construction and create a $1-billion,
developer-financed fund for pollution cleanup and marsh restoration in this
last large urban estuary. The plan also involves a unique collaboration of
normally fractious environmental regulators.
   Robert F. Oury, president of Rotec Industries, developed a system to
deliver concrete directly from batchplants to monolith pours at Mexico's
Huites Dam. The material traveled as far as 400 meters in 90 seconds,
saving money and allowing swift completion of the job.
   John D. Clarkson, chief structural engineer with the Army Corps of
Engineers' Huntington, W. Va., district, revolutionized navigation lock
design with a concept that, by halving costs on one project, will save $200
million. The design places water intake culverts in the floor of a lock
rather than in walls, vastly reducing the amount of structural concrete
required. It promises to become the new standard for locks.
   Alcoa's $200-million cleanup of a plant site in Massena, N.Y., has
become a model for the private sector, thanks largely to Boyd Braniff, the
firm's environmental remediation manager. One of the largest private,
single-company cleanup projects in the country, the effort covers 17
separate waste sites, 37 acres of landfills and 110 acres of contaminated
lagoons. Braniff's approach to the project stresses innovative performance
incentives and unusually strong levels of communication among contractors
and regulators.
   Armed with design strategies to fight fear and crime, Sarasota Chief
Planner Sherry Plaster Carter teamed up with the police department to
reclaim seedier sections of the Florida city from muggers, drug dealers and
prostitutes. Her crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)
program, already a model for other cities, ensures that all Sarasota
projects are planned with an emphasis on public safety through the built
environment, a powerful yet low-cost tool. In Carter's pilot CPTED
sector--the once-troubled North Tamiami Trail area--crime has dropped 29%
since 1990 and investment is soaring.
   Fluor-Daniel project director Ed Kirkley orchestrated a fast-track
design and construction effort that put a $200-million Georgia carpet plant
into operation 181 days after it was leveled by fire. Partnering and
teambuilding helped slash a two-year rebuilding schedule.
   Mercury Productions Inc.'s Jonathan Antevy and FMI Corp.'s Hoyt G.
Lowder were the first to move practical construction applications onto the
World Wide Web via their joint venture, the Global Construction Network.
They developed software that enabled web sites, created for individual
construction projects, to be used for partnering, real-time communication,
information exchange, scheduling and cost control.
   Chairman Frank T. MacInnis and Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey M. Levy
rescued JWP Inc. from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. They refocused the nation's
largest subcontractor, now known as EMCOR Group Inc., on its core business
of electrical and mechanical construction without jeopardizing ongoing work
of construction subsidiaries.
   Drawing on 40 years of experience in hydrology, Wisconsin engineer Paul
Johnson designed an earthen dam and irrigation system for 4,000 citizens of
Itbayat, an island in the Philippines. With no knowledge of hydraulic
engineering, the people were dependent on one commercial crop, garlic,
which no longer is profitable. Working with relief agencies, Johnson's
efforts, performed for free and on his own time, gave islanders a chance at
economic self-sustainability through growing a wider variety of crops.
   M.J. Nigel Priestley, a structural engineering professor at the
University of California at San Diego, successfully introduced to the U.S.
a cost-saving method of seismic-resistant design called
displacement-ductility capacity analysis for reinforced concrete
structures. Devised in New Zealand, it is used for designing structural
components of elevated freeways. The method can shave up to 15% off the
cost of new construction and more than 30% on retrofits. Unlike standard
force-based procedures, it permits determining whether bridge details in
fact furnish sufficient deformation capacity.
