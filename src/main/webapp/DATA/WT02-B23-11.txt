 <H1><P ALIGN=CENTER>Commerce on the Net</H1>


<H2><P ALIGN=CENTER>All Hype?  or  Hurry Up!</H2>

<H4>

<DD>
While the Internet market size debate continues, more and more businesses 
are appreciative of the fact that Internet commerce can no longer be ignored. 
A strong Internet presence is becoming more of an integral part of their 
regular marketing mix and a substantial piece of their budget. In addition,
more large and small companies as well as home-based businesses are investing 
significant amounts of time and money into what they hope will be a substantial 
return on their investments - - the Internet and it’s World Wide Web. 

Recently  adjusting their own study results, Nielson now concludes that 
approximately 19.4 million people are currently using the Internet. 
Although many sources disagree on specific growth rate figures, everyone 
seems to agree that the Internet is rapidly growing and recent figures rate 
this growth at between 51% and 63%. What seems to be exciting many industry 
watchers and players about the Internet is its capability of  supplying 
targeted advertising directly to prospects who not only need,  but actively 
seek out information from the ever-growing volume of resources available on 
the World Wide Web.  <P>

<DD>I’ve been told by one Internet advertising rep that the Internet has become 
one of the most successful methods of utilizing many diverse marketing 
disciplines.  One can employ the Shotgun approach to advertising or the 
Rifle Shot approach along with Direct Marketing methods. Not only can an 
advertiser pinpoint his advertisements to his specific proepect audience, 
he can also instantly be available to the masses. WHO'S PAYING? Internet 
advertising expenditures, as expected, continues on an upswing, which, up 
until very recently, relied almost exclusively on inflated estimates of 
returns that promised to "boggle the mind. Individual business Web sites 
and Internet Service Providers account for more than a third of the total 
spending and are followed by computer related industries. WHO'S GETTING PAID?
The leading 16 ad-driven (supported) Web sites had an estimated ad revenue
of $6.6 million in March of this year alone! InfoSeek, a widely used search
engine, is credited for generating approximately $1.7 million of this followed 
by ZDNet's $856,000 and c/net's $555,000.

 <P>

<DD>So, what results do we see on the Targeted BUYER'S end of the equation? 
Having been bombarded personally with mail, e-mail and many other forms of 
excitement and hype, I decided it was probably best to get a "second opinion."  
I had my company conduct an independent national US study in order to get 
some real answers directly from these "targeted Internet users."  By going 
directly to the Internet users that businesses were directing much of their 
Internet presence and promotions to, I was able to make some startling 
discoveries about Internet commerce. In a quantified (random) survey of 1,246
qualified individuals and professional purchasers in business and government,
we found that there has already been a 12% increase in direct purchasing of
Internet promoted products and services. A significant increase over 1995 
figures, in fact, more products are selling directly off of current Internet
advertising and promotions then even predicted by much of the existing "hype." 
Additionally, the normal 20 day to 3 month "sales process" from more 
conventional promotions and advertising is being cut in as much as half. 
This was found to be the case in and outside of the computer related 
products and services currently available directly from the Internet 
although computer products and services accounted for over 67% of all 
commerce successfully conducted. We were also able to obtain details on 
media and marketing effectiveness in order to determine what Internet media, 
publications, services, and marketing strategies were acceptable to the 
target prospects giving additional credence to the development of the Code of Conduct
that marketers and publicists must adhere to even in this, the "Jetson's 
age."


 <P>

<DD>These significant figures go to show, perhaps, that those who have been 
or are now investing their time and money into their own Internet presence
and promotions are doing so at less risk than previously envisioned even by 
the Internet nay sayers and conservative analysts. Advertising on the 
Internet is growing in volume and complexity. Many new effectiveness methods 
are being developed almost on a daily basis as agencies and providers work 
out new revenue generating concepts for themselves. I have great faith that 
many of them will actually be of some benefit to their clients as well.  
We’ll take up some of these new marketing methods and cover ways in which 
to ensure the old timers still can “get the most bang for their buck” in 
future columns.  Till then, stay well and stay "tuned and online."
