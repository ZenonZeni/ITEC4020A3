  <H1>RAINFOREST FACTS</H1>
<BODY>
<P>The Amazonian Rainforest covers over a billion acres, encompassing areas in Brazil, Venzuela, Colombia and the Easterm Adean region of Ecuador and Peru.  If Amazonia were a country, it would be the ninth largest.
</P><P>
One hectare (2.47 acres) may contain over 750 types of trees and 1500 species of Higher plants.</P>
<P>The Amazon has over 1000 tributaries and is over three miles wide in some parts.  One sixth of all the freshwater that flows on the earth moves through the Amazon drainage system, greater flow volume than the next eight largest rivers combined!  An ocean-going vessel can cruise over 2300 miles up the mighty river, almost crossing the entire continent of South America.</P><P>  <H1>THE GOOD NEWS</H1>
<P>Our remarkable tropical Rainforests are beautiful, precious and teaming with life.  Over half of the world's known plant and animal species call the Rainforest their home.  With thousands of life-forms still being identified, you can imagine the vast potential this botanical treasure house offers in health and nutritional values.</P>
<P>Is there a piece of the Rainforest near you?  Consider this--fully 80% of the developed worlds's diet originated in the tropical Rainforest.  We are surrounded by its bountiful gifts:  </P>
<P>Rice, corn, potatoes, sugarcane, bananas, oranges, coffee, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, chocolate, pineapples, avacados, vanilla, grapefruit and a variety of spices and teas all had their origins in the world's Rainforests.  At least 3000 fruits may be available in the Rainforest:  of these, only 200 are now in use.  Some, like cherimoya, papaya and mango are only recently being enjoyed in the northern markets.</P>
<P>The Rainforests also provide essential environmental services for all of us.  Because the Amazon Rainforest is continuosly recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen, it has been described as the "Lungs of our Planet."</P>
<H1>THE BAD NEWS</H1>
<P>A large part of the world's greatest Rainforests are being leveled for farming, ranching and logging.  It appears we are losing Earth's greatest biological treasures just as we are beginning to appreciate their true value.</P>
<P>"The chainsaws and fires are doing their work in the world's tropical forests.  An acre and a half of these forest are lost every second with tragic consequences for both developing and industrial countries."   World Resources Institute. </P>
<P>"Nearly half of the world's species of plants, animals and microorganisms will be destroyed or severely threatened over the next quarter century."  Peter Raven, Our Diminishing Tropical Rainforests.
</P>
<P>"In the year 1979, 29,000 square miles of Rainforests were destroyed.  In 1990, the rate accelerated to 55,000 square miles per year. That is an area larger than the state of Florida, lost each year."  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</P>
<P>Of more than 265,000 known plant species, less than three percent have been tested for their medical applications, yet out of this tiny portion have come 25 percent of all medicines."  Michael Blalick, Director, Institute of Economic Botany</P>
<P>"Each time a medicine man dies, it is as if a library has burned down."  Dr. Mark Plotkin, Ethnobotanist, Conservation International.</P>
<P>There were an estimated ten million Indians living in the Amazonian Rainforest five centuries ago.  Today, there are less than 200,000.</P>
<H1>THE GOOD NEWS</H1>
<P>When managed properly, the forest can provide for our needs on a perpetual basis.  We believe that harvesting the Rainforest's life-giving resources on a sustainable basis will stop the destruction of these imperiled ecosystems.</P>
<P>By purchasing renewable Rainforest products we help to protect the Rainforest and support the native people's economy.  Sufficient demand for sustainable Rainforest products is necessary for preservation efforts to succeed.  We can effect positive change.  By sharing these ideas and Rainforest products with others we are promoting individual and planetary health.
</P>
<P>Use the products regularly, become familar with the Rainforest's nutritional benefits and help protect a world resource at risk.</P>
