<H3>FIVE THINGS INVESTORS SHOULD KNOW BEFORE
CHOOSING A MONEY MARKET FUND</H3>

<B>CHICAGO</B> (May 31) - Kemper Financial Services, Inc. (KFS), the investment
adviser to Kemper Money Market Fund, today announced it is offering a
free brochure to help savers and investors make wise decisions when
selecting a money market fund. Titled <EM><STRONG>Shopping Around for a Money Market
Fund? Five Things You Should Know Before You Invest</EM></STRONG>, 
the brochure can be obtained by calling 1-800-694-1080,

<P>

The brochure identifies five important considerations in choosing a
money market fund and offers guidelines for understanding each
consideration.
<P>

"Money market funds are an essential building block for any sound
financial plan. They are designed to deliver money market yields and to
maintain stability of principal," said Michele Rudin, director of retail
money fund marketing at KFS. "Yet, some money market funds have turned
to risky strategies to deliver higher yields. Helping to educate
investors on how to make sound investment decisions is one of our
primary goals."
<P>

According to the money fund specialists at Kemper, whether a person is a
conservative saver or a savvy investor, there are a few things he or she
should know before choosing a money market fund, including:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>
consider your tax bracket and the benefits of taxable versus tax-
exempt income
<P>

<LI>
look for consistent performance over time, not just today's hottest
yields
<P>

<LI>
check out the fund's expenses and how big a bite they will take out 
of your return
<P>

<LI>
think about the account services you will use and find out if they 
will cost you extra
<P>

<LI>
take a look at the fund's sponsor and track record
</UL>
