Supplement No. 4 to Part 742--Key Escrow or Key Recovery Products 
Criteria

Key Recovery Feature

    (1) The key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt 
ciphertext shall be accessible through a key recovery feature.
    (2) The product's cryptographic functions shall be inoperable 
until the key(s) or other material/information required to decrypt 
ciphertext is recoverable by government officials under proper legal 
authority and without the cooperation or knowledge of the user.
    (3) The output of the product shall automatically include, in an 
accessible format and with a reasonable frequency, the identity of 
the key recovery agent(s) and information sufficient for the key 
recovery agent(s) to identify the key(s) or other material/
information required to decrypt the ciphertext.
    (4) The product's key recovery functions shall allow access to 
the key(s) or other material/information needed to decrypt the 
ciphertext regardless of whether the product generated or received 
the ciphertext.
    (5) The product's key recovery functions shall allow for the 
recovery of all required decryption key(s) or other material/
information required to decrypt ciphertext during a period of 
authorized access without requiring repeated presentations of access 
authorization to the key recovery agent(s).

Interoperability Feature

    (6) The product's cryptographic functions may interoperate with:
    (i) Other key recovery products that meet these criteria, and 
shall not interoperate with products whose key recovery feature has 
been altered, bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered inoperative; 
and
    (ii) Non-key recovery products only when the key recovery 
product permits access to the key(s) or other material/information 
needed to decrypt ciphertext generated or received (i.e., one 
direction at a minimum) by the key recovery product.

Design, Implementation and Operational Assurance

    (7) The product shall be resistant to efforts to disable or 
circumvent the attributes described in criteria one through six.
    (8) The product's cryptographic function's key(s) or other 
material/information required to decrypt ciphertext shall be 
escrowed with a key recovery agent(s) (who may be a key recovery 
agent(s) internal to the user's organization) acceptable to BXA, 
pursuant to the criteria in Supplement No. 5 to Part 742. Since the 
establishment of a key management infrastructure and key recovery 
agents may take some time, BXA will, while the infrastructure is 
being built, consider exports of key recovery encryption products 
which facilitate establishment of the key management infrastructure 
before a key recovery agent is named.
    Exporters of products described in this Supplement No. 4 to part 
742 are required to furnish the name of an agent by December 31, 
1998.
