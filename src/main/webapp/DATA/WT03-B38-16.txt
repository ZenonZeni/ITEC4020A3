DEMAND FOR SCORING PREDICTED FOR 1996

     More complex uses of scoring are expected to emerge in 1996 as
the tool becomes more widely-used by credit managers for marketing and
predicting loan profitability.  
     Expect scoring models to be used as customer and total
relationship management tools rather than just as risk assessment
methods, experts say.  
     Scoring also will gain acceptance in previously unchartered
waters, such as the mortgage lending market.  
     But industry experts tell us you need to be prepared for
legislative and implementational obstacles related to scoring.
     Concern over consumer privacy also may prompt more patrolling of
this technology by regulators.  Creditors and scoring vendors should
pursue consumer education programs to ease fears over scoring tools
and to ensure that new legislation will not restrict their business
practices. 

Evolving Scoring Methods

     Creditors can expect a change in business focus in 1996 from
credit risk management to customer relationship management, according
to John Coffman of Credit Strategy Management (CSM) of Atlanta.  For
example, many creditors now  are starting to use data and predictive
models to manage the entire customer relationship, including
retention, relationship optimization, product design and targeting.
     Creditors need to understand that risk management by itself is
not sufficient to ensure optimal profitability, and that the
management of risk must be integrated with the management of other
aspects of customer behavior, according to Coffman.  
     Scoring's use is being encouraged by the Washington, D.C.-based
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac).  Freddie Mac issued a
four-page letter last summer supporting scoring practices by lenders
for residential mortgages. 
     A few months later, Fannie Mae, formerly known as the Federal
National Mortgage Association, put out an eight-page letter that
encouraged lenders to use credit scores in the application process.  
     The moves by both organizations have prompted new entrants into
the scoring arena -- the technology no longer will be used by only
credit card companies, but also by mortgage lenders and various other
players in that market, said Marty Abrams, director of privacy and
consumer policy at TRW of Orange, Calif.
     "It really has changed the way mortgage [lending] has been
conducted, because now we have an endorsement of scoring by a quasi-
governmental agency," said Chet Wiermanski, vice president of
acquisition and risk management services for Chicago-based Trans 
Union.

More Work Needed To Educate Consumers, Regulators

     Abrams believes increased use of automated processing throughout
the marketplace -- not just credit models, but response and
profitability models as well -- will create greater interest on how
those models work.  "I think that this is the first in what will be a
fairly broad discussion into the whole sense of how models work, and
how they affect consumers," he said.
     Wiermanski also sees a need for stepped-up consumer education to
offset critics' fears that scores will be used to reject low scorers.
     Score developers and users will need to do more than educate
consumers on how they determine scores -- they'll need to educate
businesses also.  "There is going to be an incredible use of
statistical modeling of data to determine who it makes sense to do
business with, and who it doesn't.  And that is going to create a lot
of controversy," Abrams said.
     If the industry isn't proactive in educating consumers,
regulators may force it to be with new rules or legislation.  
     The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, was
considering last year whether to require creditors and bureaus to
disclose risk scores as part of a consumer's credit report file. 
After much industry feedback, the FTC decided
against mandating a score disclosure.  "That, to me, was a key
decision, considering the complexity of risk scores and proprietary
score cards on the part of credit marketers and credit grantors,"
Abrams said.

Consumer Education Issues

    The decision may create some key consumer education dilemmas in
the coming year.  "We still have to find a way to help consumers
understand how they can better prepare themselves to be good credit
consumers," Abrams said. In addition, creditors and scoring vendors
likely will struggle with regulators' concern over "disparate
treatment" and its relation to scoring, said Fran Lyons, principal or
Scoring Solutions Inc. in Atlanta.  
    Regulators fear that consumers in protected categories will be
turned down for mortgage loans because they are scored based on their
credit history, causing the disparate treatment of a protected group.

Total Relationship Management

    The industry will have to educate regulators that scores do not
result in disparate treatment.  The evidence overwhelmingly suggests
that automated decision-making is much fairer to consumers than
judgmental decision-making, Abrams said.  
    Coffman thinks the industry as a whole will continue to move in
the direction of total relationship management:  "It has caught on
quite quickly."  
    He cited recent articles on AT&T Universal Card as an example of
this trend.  "You're seeing more and more companies recognizing that
they need to integrate the management of these two functions:  risk
management and customer management [see related story, p. 8]," Coffman
said.

Success Strategies

    One key to success in the credit management arena will be the
creation of a comprehensive and easily accessed customer database. 
Many creditors already have begun creating customer databases for this
purpose, and the trend will continue, Coffman said.  
    Using a comprehensive customer database, along with modeling
tools, will allow the creditor to manage all customer relationships.  
    The database might include current and historical financial data
as well as transaction data.  It also should include external data
about customers, such as credit history and other demographic or
lifestyle data.  (Marty Abrams, TRW, 214/390-3659; John Coffman, CSM,
404/266-1242; Fran Lyons, Scoring Solutions, 770/988-264; Chet
Wiermanski, Trans Union, 312/466-7794.) 

Scoring 101

     More and more creditors and scoring vendors will be forced to
educate consumers as to the ABC's of scoring, experts tell us.  
     But what should you focus on when developing a consumer education
program?  TRW instructs its representatives to focus on five "fair
information values" when interacting with consumers:
   *  partnership between TRW and its customers;
   *  fairness;
   *  balance; 
   *  education; and
   *  dialogue. 

Advances in Scoring

     Consider these latest scoring and credit management tools from
industry vendors:

*  TRW and Fair, Isaac are working together to offer small business
lenders a way to download and score TRW business credit reports with
Fair, Isaac's Small Business Scoring Service (SBSS).  SBSS, a
combination of software and pooled-data scorecards for evaluating
small business credit applications, provides an automated interface to
TRW Business Information Services' database of business credit
reports.     (Fair, Isaac, 800/999-2955; TRW, 800/854-7201.) 

*  Equifax offers RE-APPEAR, an automated notification delivery
service for the collections industry.  Users of the service select
criteria so that credit files of consumers who have collections
pending with the user and have disappeared or "skipped" are flagged. 
When new or different address or inquiry activity is posted to the
file, RE-APPEAR automatically notifies the customer of the name,
address and phone number of the credit grantor who queried the file
and who can then provide updated information on the consumer. 
(Equifax, 800/879-1025.) 

*  Trans Union's Revenue Projection Model (RPM), a two-year model
typically used to predict likely revenue to be generated from
prescreened solicitation prospects, now can be used to make inactive
accounts, low-balance revolving accounts and seasonal accounts more
profitable, according to Trans Union officials.  Research conducted by
Fair, Isaac, the developer of the model, shows that RPM also can be
used to rank order existing customers based on likely revenue 
generation in the 12 months following scoring.  (Trans Union, 312/466-
7730.)

TIPS FOR MANAGING YOUR NEXT BANKRUPTCY COLLECTION AUDIT

    A careful audit of your outside bankruptcy collection agent can
help improve bankruptcy accounts management and increase profits.  To
aide in this endeavor, CRMR elicited advice from one independent
consultant, Raymond Bell Jr. of Abington, Pa.
     Bell spent many years managing a bankruptcy department for a
major credit card company and has audited both collection and
bankruptcy accounts.  He directed the handling of consumer bankruptcy
cases at a national law firm and now is a full-time, independent
consultant.
     If you do nothing else when auditing your outside bankruptcy
collection agency, your time will be well-spent reviewing the final
trustee accounting reports to ensure that your claims have been paid,
Bell said.
     "The final trustee accounting report is the most important audit
tool in ensuring that you have received correct disbursements from the
bankruptcy estate," he explained.
     This report will indicate whether accounts have been transferred
to a different bankruptcy type, if payments were recorded improperly,
or if the trustee made a mistake, he added.
     Require your agent to provide a complete account listings for
Chapter 7, 11 and 13 cases that are active, with data fields for the
following:

*  Account assignment date;
*  Date account information was placed in the agent's system;
*  Date the request for notice was sent;
*  Date the proof of claim was sent;
*  Date the proof of claim was received by the court of the trustee;
*  Date of court adversary proceeding;  
*  Chapter 13 planned percent payback;
*  Claim balance filed with the court;
*  Last payment date, payment amount and accumulative amount of
       total payment received.

     You should review the rationale used to generate the reports, and
ask that the agent retain the account listing in an extract computer
until your audit is completed.  This will allow you to subsort
information as needed quickly and your requests will not slow down the
agent's system during business hours, Bell said.

     Bell had other suggestions to follow during an audit:

*   Establish a pattern of follow-up frequency and criteria for cases.
For xample, how many missed payments should trigger a follow-up call
or isit for Chapter 13 cases of a certain amount of credit?

*   Internally select segments of cases from each type of bankruptcy
for random spot checking.

*   Using at least three remittance reports within a 12-month period,
test for payments on at least 50 percent of the accounts.

*   Review your contract provisions and take a copy with you for
reference during your audit.

*   Review your prior audit commentary and the agents response.  Take
copies to the audit with you for reference purposes.

On-site Review

    Bell said the first place he visits during an on-site review is
the lunch- and meeting-room bulletin boards.  These tell a lot about
how the agency communicates and whether it is up-to-date on issues, he
added.
    While at the agency, perform audit functions without interruption
and do not leave notes unattended.  If you need to ask questions,
which can intimidate agency staff, make a concise list and be sure a
manager is present at this stage in the review, Bell advised. 
    While on-site Bell suggests reviewing the following:

*   Licenses.  Are they current and do they apply to state provisions
governing an agency?  In cases of an attorney, has this person passed
the bar in the state in which he/she is working?  Additionally, the
attorney must have renewed the license in each state of practice and
must meet the state's continuing legal education requirements.

*   Written procedures.  The policy guidelines that pertain to your
account should be up to date.

*   Staffing.  Additions, deletions or administrative promotions as
they relate to relate to your account should be explained thoroughly.

*   Training.  In-house training, organizational structure and
frequency of internal case reviews by management should be adequate.

Post Review

    After the on-site review, be sure to provide the client with an
overview highlighting the negative and positive aspects of your report
before you leave.  This discussion should be private, Bell said.  
    Provide the agency with your audit summary.  This ensures there
is agreement to proceed with any corrective action and the
implementation and completion time of desired action.  "The agency
should be required to respond, in writing, by a pre-agreed time," Bell
said.  
    Common problems that may affect agency turnaround include
unorganized agency files, unreceived documents and payments, Bell
added.
    To keep bankruptcy proceedings running smoothly, Bell suggested
several in-house tweaks.  For example, establish tracking abilities
for electronic and paper referrals to the agency and require the agent
acknowledge referrals.  Additionally, time and date stamp all
bankruptcy correspondence before sending it to the agency.  This will
aid in auditing the agency's procedures, he said.
    Also, establish computer models to predict cash flow and
projected return on Chapter 13 cases that can be compared to actual
in-coming, Bell said.
    Internally track agent support requests listing the nature an
type of request every quarter.  This will help you be more proactive
with this information in the future, Bell said.
    Lastly, implement a training program for your bankruptcy and
audit staffs to ensure future audits run smoothly, Bell said. 
(Raymond P. Bell, private consultant, 800/735-0481.) 

Agency Reports You Need

*   Final trustee accounting reports.
*   A monthly tally of Chapter 7, 11 and 13 claims filed.  Reconcile
          this with internal records.
*   A monthly summary of post-petition asset Chapter 7 cases filed. 
          Reconcile this with internal records.
*   A monthly summary on any claim that will not be paid with
          explanations.
*   Notification of balances that differ from the account balance
          referred to the agent.
*   A monthly summation of claims paid as reported on the final
          trustee accounting reports. 
*   A monthly list of claims where objections were received, the cause
          of the objection, and the final disposition of the
          objection.
*   A quarterly submission of Chapter 13 cases where no payment was 
received for 24 months or more without explanation from the court of
the trustee handling the cases.
*   A quarterly report listing Chapter 7 cases where no discharge
          order has been received in eight months or more with no
          explanation from the court or trustee.
*   A monthly summation of cases where a dismissal order was received.
*   Quarterly status of litigation, including all costs incurred to
          date in the case.
*   Monthly summation of settled cases for which documents have not
          been received by the agent in 60 or more days, with
          explanation.
*   Monthly status of unresolved litigation cases that were filed more
          than 90 days ago.
*   A monthly random selection of at least 5 or  more litigation cases
          with related court pleadings and correspondence.

VIDEOCONFERENCING HELPING INCREASE LOAN APPLICATIONS

    Videoconferencing is helping Hempstead, N.Y.-based NatWest Bank
to nearly double the rate at which applicants fill out their loan
forms by bringing the process directly to the model-home site.
    Prospective condominium buyers in a 700-unit development in Park
Place, N.J., now can access NatWest loan officers via
videoconferencing directly from the model home.  However, consumers
must finish the paperwork at the branch.
    "Typically 25 percent [of people inquiring about mortgages] will
fill out the application.  We are running over 50 percent when they go
fill out the application at the model home," said Andrew Demeo,
director of interactive marketing for NatWest.
    Videoconferencing allows consumers to see NatWest loan
representatives and view information on the television screen while
talking on the phone.
    "It is a remote delivery and they are not pressured by being in
the room with an individual," said Demeo.  "They feel in total control
and that seems to be important to the consumers.  It gets to our
culture as Americans.  When a salesperson comes and talks to us in
person, we let them finish their sales pitch.  However, the
socialization of how we deal with telemarketers is different.  Most
people tend not to stay on the line.  If you can offer that type of
control to the customer, yet offer as much personal contact as a face
to face [conversation] and make it fun, it works."

How it Works

    Once consumers have toured the model home, they can enter the
living room, turn on a television set there and place a call
simultaneously to a NatWest representative.  The consumer can see a
still graphic of the representative in the top one-fifth of the screen
on a proprietary pay-per-view channel.
    The remaining four-fifths of the tv screen is reserved for moving
graphics.  For example, customers may want to see in graphic form how
payments for a 15-year adjustable mortgage compare to a 15-year fixed
mortgage.  The NatWest representative can input the necessary
information on the screen and a graphical presentation will appear at
the model home.
    NatWest is testing full-motion video for the service and plans
soon to offer standard personal computer (PC)-to-PC modem
communication.  The bank also is preparing a videoconferencing service
over the Internet.
    Demeo would not reveal the cost of the product, but said it "is a
lot less than you think."  He explained that is a matter of deploying
a pc and television set in a cabinet.  
    Demeo advises lenders to think of videoconferencing as an
opportunity help consumers find products which are appropriate for
their specific needs.  "The key element is presenting concise
information as well as [having the consumers] feel like they are
meeting somebody," Demeo said.
    After the homebuyers decide which loans are right for them, the
NatWest representatives will transmit a closing bill and title right
on the tv screen.  In addition, NatWest can estimate the closing and
tax costs for the consumers.  The application cannot be completed on-
line.  However, consumers are taken line-by-line down the application
so that they will have all the necessary information when they visit a
NatWest branch to complete the application.
    NatWest launched the service in the first quarter of 1995 after
Demeo's marketing staff worked closely with officials at the QVC home
shopping channel to learn how to concisely present complicated
information via video.
    For example, QVC warned Demeo that customers need to be
entertained more in a videoconferencing presentation as they are less
apt to just sit and listen when they can simply press an off button. 
(Andrew Demeo, NatWest Bank, 
516/559-8004.)

LESSONS FROM GOVERNMENT WORKERS.  

    Creditors should establish written policies on handling
delinquent payments from certain consumer segments, credit consultants
tell CRMR.  This is especially true for creditors that service
government employees, in light of the recent lengthy federal
government shutdown which left many employees without paychecks for
weeks. Consider these strategies, offered by some industry
consultants, when developing a government employee policy:

  *  Review on a case-by-case basis. Examine each case for unusual
circumstances before penalizing an account or initiating collection
efforts.  

  *  Instruct customers to contact you. Consumers may assume you are
aware of their situation.  Statements and bills should advise
consumers to contact a credit department and explain any payment
difficulties. 

  *  Consider special programs. Lenders can establish special
unsecured loan programs with no- or low interest rates for federal
workers affected by a government shutdown.  These programs may not 
be very lucrative, however, they will inspire long-term customer
loyalty, experts say.

MOVER AND SHAKER EMERGING. 

    U.S. appraisal automation vendors beware:  one provider of
appraisal reports and services is pushing to become a significant
player in the industry.  Premier Appraisals of Atlanta recently
purchased H.A. Yeargin & Associates, a residential real estate
appraisal company.  Premier officials said the company plans to
aggressively acquire other independent appraisal firms and market
these services in housing markets throughout the United States. 
Several investors are funding Premier's acquisition program, including
Chrysalis Ventures of Louisville, Ky., Windcrest Partners of New York
and David A. Jones, chairman and CEO of Humana Corp.  (Michael Mattox,

HUD OKAY MEANS MORE AUTOMATION.  

    Look for the new year to bring an uptick in automated
underwriting (see related story, p. 1).  The U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for example, recently approved
the use of an automated underwriting program by Collateral Mortgage
Ltd. of Birmingham, Ala.  The program, pmiAURA system, offered by PMI
Mortgage Services Co. of San Francisco, will be used to underwrite
Federal Housing Authority (FHA)-insured mortgages.  Collateral
Mortgage is the second pmiAURA system licensee, and only the third
lender nationally, to receive HUD approval to use an automated
underwriting system for FHA loans.  The system predicts the relative
likelihood of loan default by combining a risk-based, computerized
statistical model with a database drawing on the experience of more
than 1 million loans.  The pmiAURA system uses a rules-based
technology to check an application's conformance with conventional or
government underwriting guidelines.  (Brad German, PMI Mortgage,
703/934-6352.)

FIRM REORGANIZES DIVISIONS.  

    Creditors and vendors should watch for new developments from
Atlanta-based Equifax as it reorganizes its corporation.  Equifax
announced last week that its Financial Services Group has assumed
international responsibility for all its products and services. 
Thomas F. Chapman will assume responsibility for international
operations.  Chapman, the executive vice president and group executive
in charge of Financial Services, also will oversee the developing and
deploying of new products and services in the United States.  "This
change ... is going to maximize our international development and
customer service while improving product innovation and technological
enhancement," Chapman said.  Equifax's international revenues now
exceed $210 million a year.  (Norman Black, Equifax, 404/888-5040.)

RISK MANAGERS NEEDED, REGARDLESS OF LAYOFFS

    You could fare better in the churning financial services
marketplace by becoming skilled in implementing leading-edge credit
technologies.  That's the lesson evident in the business' latest major
downsizing, AT&T Corp.'s plan to lay off 40,000 employees as part of
its efforts to reorganize by 1997.
    More than 200 of the people already accepting AT&T's voluntary
severance    packages work in the Jacksonville, Fla.-based AT&T
Universal Card division, a spokesperson confirmed.  He would not say
how many are from the risk management department nor give details on
the severance packages offered.
    But CRMR has learned that risk management executives are among
the total.  Several of them already have been approached by other 
issuers, says one credit executive who asked not to be named.  

High Demand

    These executives are in such high demand because of their ability
to implement leading-edge technologies, such as statistical analysis,
behavior scoring and neural networks, the source said. 
    A recent survey by Allard Associates of San Francisco, an
executive recruiter in the credit card and banking industries,
indicated that 75 percent of issuers surveyed would be adding staff in
1996.  Respondents said many of these people would be in the risk
management area.  These issuers also reported the shortage of
qualified executives is so acute that card companies are prepared to
sponsor non-U.S. citizens for the jobs.  (Mitch Montagna, AT&T
Universal, 904/954-7571; Kathy Trott, Allard Associates, 415/433-
