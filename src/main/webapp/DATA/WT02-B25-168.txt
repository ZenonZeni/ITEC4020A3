<P>People with disabilities strongly prefer to, and increasingly do, live independent and productive lives in their own homes in our communities.  However, more than any other population group, people with disabilities are most likely to experience acute housing problems - problems of stigma and discrimination, affordability, and access to safe and decent housing.  People with disabilities, particularly those who rely exclusively on SSI benefits, are also among the lowest income households in the country, and often do not have the financial resources to obtain decent and safe housing that meets their needs and preferences.

<P>Recent changes in federal housing policy, namely the designation of federal public and assisted housing as "elderly only," will dramatically worsen the housing plight of people with disabilities.  The profound implications of this policy change which began in 1992 can no longer be ignored by the federal government and the affordable housing system.  Federal housing resources must be reallocated to address the negative consequences that people with disabilities are experiencing from this legislation, consequences that are clearly spelled out in this report.

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force has put forth a series of recommendations that must be implemented to address the acute and increasing housing crisis faced by people with disabilities in this country today.  The recommendations are based on the principle of equity -- that is, people with disabilities are entitled to a "fair share" of the existing and new federal housing resources that are available in communities across the country. 

<P>Even at a time of severe budget constraints, the federal government has an obligation to replace the housing resources that have been taken away from people with disabilities during the past four years and that will continue to be lost to them as the designation of "elderly only" housing expands.  The federal government and policy makers must ensure that federal mainstream housing resources are made available to meet the housing needs.  People with disabilities, along with their family members, advocates, service providers, and the members of the CCD Housing Task Force will continue to urge federal officials, policy makers, and the affordable housing system to "open the doors."
