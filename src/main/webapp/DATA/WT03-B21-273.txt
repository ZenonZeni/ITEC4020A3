of
 both
human

<FONT SIZE=5> Water covers almost 70 percent of the surface of the globe and is the
Earth's most abundant resource. About 97 percent of the water is in the
oceans and is too salty for drinking, growing crops, or most other human
uses. Almost all of the freshwater is held in the ice caps of Antarctica
and Greenland or in deep underground aquifers where, for most practical
purposes, it is inaccessible for human use. Only about 0.3 percent of the
earth's freshwater, less than 100,000 cubic kilometers or 81 trillion
acre-feet (the unit of water needed to cover one acre to a depth of one
foot, which is about 326,000 gallons), is found in rivers and lakes. These
surface waters together with accessible groundwater resources comprise the
usable supply.
<DD>Water is also one of the Earth's most renewable resources. Globally, the
total quantity of water is essentially constant and unaffected by human
activities. Driven by energy from the Sun, water constantly circulates from
the seas, lakes, and streams (through evaporation) or the plants (through
transpiration) to the atmosphere and back to earth (through precipitation).
The evaporative process removes salts and other impurities that may be
picked up either naturally or as a result of human use, making it possible
to use and reuse water virtually indefinitely.

Despite the apparent global and national abundance and the renewability of
the resource, water adequacy has emerged as one of the nation's primary
resource issues. For many of the developing countries of the world the
problem is a critical one. In the USA, concerns about the availability
of freshwater to meet the demands of a growing and increasingly affluent
population while sustaining a healthy natural environment are based on
several factors: 
<DD><LI> uncertainties as to the availability of supplies
stemming from the vicissitudes of the hydrologic cycle and the threat that
a greenhouse warming might alter the cycle; 
<DD><LI> the high costs of
developing additional surface-water supplies; 
<DD><LI> the vulnerability of the
resource and the problems of restoring and protecting valued surface and
groundwater resources; 
<DD><LI> the importance of reliable supplies of
high-quality water for human and environmental health and economic
development; 
<DD><LI>the shortcomings of our institutions for allocating
scarce supplies in response to changing supply and demand conditions.

<DD>UNCERTAINTY OF SUPPLY

<DD>Timing, location, and reliability are important dimensions of the potential
value of supplies. Because of the spatial and temporal variations in the
distribution of water, national and long-term annual averages of
precipitation and runoff are poor indicators, for practical purposes, of
available supplies and potential problems. Precipitation generally declines
as one moves from east to west in the United States . Average
annual precipitation ranges from less than 1 inch in some desert areas in
the Southwest to more than 60 inches in parts of the Southeast.

<DD>Underlying these regional averages are large seasonal and annual variations
that can result in droughts and floods. In the absence of flow regulation
and storage, the ratio of the maximum to minimum streamflow within a year
may exceed 500 to 1. Natural climatic variability results in interannual
fluctuations. The ratio of very high annual flows (amounts exceeded in five
percent of the years) to very low (exceeded in 95 percent of the years) is
2.9 for the conterminous United States; the ratio for the nation's arid and
semiarid regions is significantly higher. But almost any region lacking
adequate storage is likely to encounter both periods when supplies are
relatively plentiful or even excessive as well as periods of shortages.

<DD>Water resource issues tend to be local or regional in nature: abundant
supplies in one area are of no help to water-deficit areas unless there are
facilities to transport supplies among regions. Water flows naturally
within hydrologic basins and can be moved between basins where transfer
facilities have been constructed. But water is too expensive relative to
its marginal value to transport long distances out of these existing
channels in response to climate- induced changes in supply or demand. Thus,
large seasonal, annual, interannual, and regional variations in
precipitation and runoff pose major challenges for planners and
down-to-earth risks for water users and occupants of the flood plains.

<DD>Human efforts to alter the hydrologic cycle date back to ancient times.
Primitive societies tried to bring rain through prayer, rain dances, human
and animal sacrifices, and other rituals. Cloud seeding (dropping silver
iodide crystals or dry ice into selected clouds to stimulate ice crystal
formation and induce precipitation) represents today a more recent and more
scientific, but still uncertain, attempt to influence rainfall. Although it
is questionable whether any of these intentional efforts have succeeded in
significantly modifying the rainfall, human activities are inadvertently
altering the climate. Changes in land use and land cover can affect
atmospheric circulation and the movement of moisture locally. Evaporation
from neighboring states, which depends on land use, can be the source of as
much as one-third of the precipitation of inland areas. The anthropogenic
increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases is expected to increase the average global surface
temperature. Such a change would also affect precipitation patterns,
evapotranspiration rates, the timing and magnitude of runoff, and the
frequency and intensity of storms as well as the demand for water. But the
magnitude and even the nature of these impacts on the supply and demand for
water in specific regions are largely unknown.

<DD>VULNERABILITY OF THE RESOURCE

<DD>Aquifers, which contain much of the country's usable water, are classified
as confined or unconfined. Confined aquifers are overlain by impermeable
materials and receive little or no recharge. The natural movement of water
into and out of these aquifers is so slow that they can be treated as a
stock resource that can be depleted through pumping. Unconfined aquifers,
on the other hand, are more active and integral parts of the hydrologic
cycle: continually recharged by the percolation of precipitation, snow
melt, or water from overlying streams, canals, and reservoirs. Discharges
from unconfined aquifers are the source of about 30 percent of the nation's
streamflow. Recharge and discharge rates vary with seasonal and annual
changes in precipitation and runoff as well as with pumping. In the long
term and under natural conditions, water lost through discharge is balanced
by ongoing recharge.

<DD>Pumping disrupts the equilibrium between recharge and discharge;
groundwater levels decline when water is initially withdrawn. If the rate
of pumping is not excessive, a new equilibrium is established (at a lowered
water table) in which pumping is balanced by changes in the natural rates
of discharge and recharge. Depletion can continue for decades, as it has in
the portions of the Ogallala aquifer that lie under the southern High
Plains and in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Eventually, however, if
natural flows do not adjust first, higher costs due to increased pumping
lifts and lower well yields act to reduce the rate of pumping. Higher
pumping costs have already resulted in several million acres being taken
out of irrigation in the High Plains. The San Joaquin Valley likely would
have had a similar experience were it not for the federal Central Valley
Project that provides the region with millions of acre-feet of water
annually from the Sacramento and Trinity basins in northern California. In
1980, groundwater, which provides about half of our drinking water and is
the source of nearly one-fourth of all freshwater withdrawals, was being
depleted from six western and midwestern river basins at a rate of 20.4
million acre-feet per year. In 1983 groundwater levels declined under more
than 14 million irrigated acres in eleven states in amounts ranging from 6
inches to over five feet.

<DD>Pumping from aquifers near a coastline reduces the natural discharge of
freshwater toward the sea, causing saline water to shift inland and toward
the surface. Saltwater will continue to intrude into the aquifer under
these conditions as long as pumping exceeds the flow of freshwater to the
sea. Saltwater intrusion threatens important drinking water supplies in a
number of coastal areas including Long Island; Cape Cod; seven New Jersey
counties; and the Florida cities of Miami, Tampa, and Jacksonville.

<DD>Water quality is an important dimension of water supply.<FONT SIZE=6> Water is rarely
pure.</FONT> All ground and surface water contains minerals dissolved from soil
and rock, and precipitation may contain impurities picked up in the
atmosphere. The natural concentrations of contaminants in the nation's
rivers, lakes, and aquifers are generally acceptable for most human uses.
Anthropogenic factors, however, contribute a wide variety of substances
that have reduced and in some cases destroyed the utility of specific water
supplies. Despite the major progress that has been made in recent decades
in reducing municipal and industrial point sources of pollution, about
one-third of the assessed rivers, lakes, and estuaries in 1990 were judged
to be capable of only partially supporting their designated uses.

<DD>Only a small fraction of the nation's groundwater resources is known to be
contaminated such that they fail to meet drinking water standards.
Communities that rely on groundwater for drinking are subject to federal
monitoring requirements. In most other areas, however, groundwater
monitoring is infrequent or nonexistent. Effective monitoring is expensive,
and there are millions of potential sources of groundwater contamination.
For example, roughly 20 million on-site domestic waste disposal systems in
the country contain nitrates, phosphates, pathogens, inorganic
contaminants, or other toxins that could leak into neighboring groundwater
supplies. There are 1.5 million underground tanks that store hazardous
substances or petroleum products: many of them are not protected from
corrosion, and a good many have been in service beyond their expected 15 to
20 year lifetime. Other potential sources of groundwater contamination
include landfills, abandoned waste sites, oil and gas brine pits, and the
chemicals applied to most of the 325 to 375 million acres typically planted
to crops each year.

<DD>IMPORTANCE OF THE RESOURCE

<DD>Water uses are separated into instream uses and those that involve
withdrawing the resource from a surface or groundwater source. The former
include the production of hydropower, recreation, and the provision of fish
and wildlife habitat. Water is withdrawn for a variety of purposes ranging
from drinking, the removal of wastes from homes and factories, irrigation
of crops and golf courses, and snow making. Withdrawal uses are rarely
fully consumptive; on average more than 70 percent of the water withdrawn
is eventually returned to a stream or groundwater source where it can be
used again. However, when water is withdrawn and subsequently returned, it
affects, often adversely, the quality, location, or timing of the water
available for other withdrawal or instream uses.

<DD>Freshwater withdrawals for all purposes averaged more than 1,300 gallons
per person, per day in 1990 ; consumptive use averaged about 380
gallons. Per capita withdrawals peaked in 1975, and total withdrawals
peaked in 1980. The recent decline in offstream water use is due in part to
efforts to restore some of the instream values that were sacrificed in
providing for the ten-fold increase in withdrawals between 1900 and 1980.

<DD>Irrigation and thermoelectric cooling accounted for 80 percent of all
withdrawals in 1990. In the seventeen western states, irrigation alone
accounted for five of every six gallons of water consumptively used. About
100 gallons per person per day was for domestic uses such as drinking,
bathing, washing clothes and dishes, toilets, and food preparation as well
as outdoor uses such as watering lawns and gardens and washing cars.
Drinking and cooking represent only a small fraction of domestic water use,
but in the absence of dual supply systems, all domestic supplies must meet
drinking water standards.

<DD>The importance of freshwater to society is not easily measured and is
commonly overlooked when it is readily available. But, as Benjamin Franklin
suggested, we know the value of water when the well runs dry. A striking
illustration of the importance of water is provided by the plight of the
many millions of people around the world who lack ready access to clean
water. The differences between developed and developing countries are many,
but few have greater impact on human welfare than the availability of safe
drinking water and adequate sanitation. In contrast to the situation in the
United States where these basic services are taken for granted by virtually
everyone, 1.3 billion people in the developing world (almost 1/4 of all who
live on the Earth) lack access to safe drinking water supplies and 1.8
billion are without decent sanitation facilities. Water- related diseases
and illnesses exact devastating impacts on mortality and morbidity;
prospects for economic development are also decreased by the diminished
health of the labor force and the countless hours spent transporting water
for drinking and other domestic uses from distant and often contaminated
sources.

<DD>We do not need to look abroad for examples of the costs associated with
inadequate water supplies. Microorganisms in municipal drinking water
supplies have led to several outbreaks of water- borne disease in the
United States. Crytosporidium in Milwaukee's water supply resulted in some
400,000 serious illnesses and 50 deaths in the spring of 1993. Just before
Christmas 1983, contaminated drinking water in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania
caused an outbreak of giardiasis -- a common diarrheal disease -- that left
6,000 people ill and forced 75,000 others to obtain more expensive
alternative sources of drinking water. Recent droughts in the western and
southeastern regions of the United States have resulted in sizable economic
and environmental losses. Even in the absence of drought, tens of millions
of dollars worth of potential hydropower production was sacrificed in the
Colorado, Columbia, Missouri, and Sacramento river basins when water was
allocated for the preservation of fish and wildlife.

<DD>CHALLENGES FOR THE FUTURE

<DD>There is justifiable cause for concern over the adequacy of our water
supplies. We have limited control over the resource, most opportunities for
increasing supplies are financially and environmentally costly, and current
uses are depleting or contaminating some valued supplies. While demands for
the many services provided by water are growing, institutions have been
slow to adapt to the challenges of growing scarcity, supply vulnerability,
and rising instream values.

<DD>On the other hand, there is reason for optimism as to the long-term
adequacy of water supplies. Although the costs of freshwater are likely to
rise in the future, we are in a position today to influence the magnitude
and even the nature of those costs. Critical determinants of future water
costs will be the efficiency with which existing supplies are managed, how
supplies are allocated among competing uses, and the effectiveness and
costs of efforts to protect aquatic environments and drinking water
quality.

<DD>As the competition for water increases, all users within a hydrologic unit
or watershed become increasingly interdependent; each water use can affect
the quantity or quality available to all the others. Moreover, ground and
surface water supplies are often naturally connected such that what is done
to one affects the other. Today the interdependencies among water users and
the interchangeability of supplies are all too often ignored in management
decisions because natural hydrologic regions are split into multiple
political and administrative units; water supply facilities are under
separate ownership; and ground and surface waters are subject to quite
different laws. Integrated management of existing supplies and
infrastructure, ideally at the river basin level  but also within
smaller watersheds, is a cost-effective means of increasing reliable water
supplies and resolving water conflicts in many regions.

<DD>With demand growing faster than supply in many areas, we need to provide
appropriate incentives to conserve and protect the resource, and
opportunities to allocate supplies efficiently among competing uses. When
water is under priced and its allocation is restricted by law and
tradition, the inevitable results are inefficient water use, lost
development opportunities, interruptions in service, and higher costs for
new water users. On the other hand, when the real costs are borne by users
of the resource and there are opportunities to transfer water voluntarily
among alternative uses, then the resource is used more efficiently, there
are increased incentives to develop and adopt water-conserving
technologies, the highest-value uses are assured of an adequate supply, and
society derives greater net benefits from its scarce supplies. Efficient,
voluntary water transfers must include provisions to incorporate
third-party effects into trade decisions (since parties other than the
buyer and seller are likely to be impacted by a water transfer), without
imposing high transactions costs. The nature and magnitude of future water
costs will depend importantly on our success in developing such market
institutions.

<DD>The provision of instream benefits such as fish and wildlife habitat,
water-based recreation, and the amenities of natural waterways pose special
problems because they are not marketed. Moreover, while the adoption of
water-conserving technologies can slow or even reverse the growth in demand
for domestic, industrial, and agricultural water, technology is not likely
to offer suitable substitutes for instream uses such as fish and wildlife
habitat, water- based recreation, and the amenities of natural waterways.
Another challenge for improving water management and allocation decisions
is to develop procedures that expeditiously strike an appropriate balance
among environmental, social, and developmental values. In some instances,
environmental values continue to be slighted by institutions rooted in a
bygone era when water left in a stream was assumed to have no value. In
other cases, environmental values are introduced preemptively through
legislation such as the Endangered Species Act or through long and costly
judicial or administrative proceedings. The public interest is likely to be
better served if instream uses are considered within a basin-wide context
rather than on a project by project basis.

<DD>The United States has made impressive gains over the last two decades in
restoring and protecting its water resources. But resistance is growing to
the enormous investments that continue to be made in treating industrial
and municipal wastes because of high costs and diminishing returns. More
cost-effective approaches to water-quality goals are needed. These might
include effluent fees that provide incentives to develop and adopt
least-cost technologies, and tradable permits to pollute that establish an
allowable quantity of pollution in a watershed and provide incentives to
meet this level at the lowest cost. Non-point-source pollutants such as
runoff from farms, urban areas, and construction sites and seepage from
landfills and septic systems are now the principal sources of pollutants
reaching the nation's waters. Since these pollutants lack specific points
of discharge where they can be collected and treated, watershed management
with particular emphasis on the use of riparian (riverside) lands must be
employed to achieve significant further improvements in the quality of the
nation's waters.

<DD>Concerns regarding the safety of drinking water are still growing in spite
of the billions of dollars that are spent annually monitoring and treating
supplies. Legislative reforms are needed that would:
<DD><LI> allow local
communities to target their resources to the most pressing problems; 
<DD><LI>provide the Environmental Protection Agency more flexibility to focus on
the contaminants that pose the greatest health risks; 
<DD><LI> give greater emphasis to protecting drinking water supplies from contamination in the
first place.

<DD>In summary, with improved basin-wide management of supplies, institutions
that enable water to be transferred efficiently and expeditiously among
uses in response to changing supply and demand conditions, and
cost-effective approaches to protecting aquatic ecosystems and drinking
water supplies, reliable supplies of freshwater will be available at
readily affordable prices for the foreseeable future.
