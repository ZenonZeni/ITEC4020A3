Solar energy is so fundamental to the creation and sustenance of
life that there simply would be no life without the daily flows of
the sun to Earth. Without solar energy the Earth's temperature
would drop precipitously, becoming so cold and dark that the
                         conditions that nourish life and humanity would be
                         absent.

It has been estimated that 1,000 times more energy reaches the
earth's surface from the sun every single year than could be
produced by burning all the fossil fuels mined and extracted
during that same year. The U.S. receives more energy in the form of
                         sunlight in less than 40 minutes than it does from all the
                         fossil fuels it burns in a year.

Over the centuries, human ingenuity has devised many different
technologies for directly harnessing the sun's prodigious daily
stream of photons. Today, solar collectors can gather solar
thermal energy in almost any climate to provide a reliable,
                  cost-effective source of energy for many applications
                  including hot water for homes, residential heating, and hot
                  water for industries such as laundry and food processing.

Over 1.3 million homes in the U.S., for example, use solar panels
to collect the sun's direct and diffuse rays for home and water
heating. One-third of the buildings in Israel use solar water
heating, and all new homes are required to have solar water heating
                     systems. In the city of Tokyo, Japan, alone, there are nearly
                     1.5 million buildings with solar water heaters.

Solar water heating is one of the simplest ways to use the sun's
rays to save energy and money. Americans spend over $13 billion
per year for home water heating. The amount of energy used for
this task might best be understood by a simple analogy. A
                    medium-sized automobile driven 12,000 miles during the
                    year, at an average efficiency of 22 miles per gallon, will
                    use about 11.1 equivalent barrels of oil. Meanwhile, an
                    electric water heater supplying 80 gallons of hot water per
                    day (for an average family of four) will use 11.4 equivalent
                    barrels of oil each year. Solar hot water systems should be
able to provide 60 to 80 percent of this hot water service, saving money
and preventing pollution in the process.

In some of the sunniest locations, like the deserts of the U.S.
southwest, the direct sunlight reaches peak intensities of 1000
watts per square meter -- 30% more than average intensities.
These very sunny locations can be used by solar thermal electric
                           technologies to concentrate the sun's rays onto a small
                           area to permit the buildup of high-temperature heat,
                           which in turn can be converted into electricity in a
                           conventional heat engine.

sunlight onto tubes running along the line of focus of a
                         parabolic-shaped reflective trough; 



<DD><LI>Tthe central-receiver system -- point focus central receiver (power
tower) systems that use large fields of sun-tracking reflectors
                    (heliostats) on a receiver placed on top of a tower; 



<DD><LI>The parabolic-dish system-- point-focus dish systems that use
parabolic dishes to reflect light into a receiver at the dish's focus.

Photovoltaic solar cell systems (PVs), which generate electricity
from sunlight, are one of the most exciting technologies ever
invented. They are quiet, give off no pollution, don't require
much land and water to operate, and can be used to generate both
                           electricity and fuels. PVs can be used to directly power
                           appliances and equipment. In the future, they can be
                           used for producing transport fuels like non-polluting
                           hydrogen, through a process known as electrolysis.

Many energy experts firmly believe that PVs could provide
much or most of humanity's energy needs within the century.
Historically, new energy sources and technologies have taken 50
to 100 years to become significant contributors, as oil did in
                               increasingly replacing wood, whale oil and coal more
                               than 100 years ago.

The PV industry is a product of the 20th century revolution in
solid state physics. PVs have much in common with transistors
and integrated circuit chips, which are revolutionizing the
world economy.

How much land area would it take to provide all of America's
electricity (2.9 trillion kWh in 1993) with PV power? Let's
assume 12% efficient solar cells, spaced so that half the land is
unused, in an average site in the U.S., like Missouri, where a square
                          meter of land would produce about 108 kWh of
                          electricity each year. This would require a land area of
                          26,000 square kilometers (10,000 square miles). For
                          comparison, 26,000 km^2 would be slightly larger than
                          the 25,000 km^2 of reservoir dams already being used
by Hydro Quèbec in eastern Canada. The big difference, however, is
that the PVs would generate 1000 percent more electricity than
provided by these hydrodams.

From another perspective, 26,000 km^2 is the equivalent of
three-fourths of the Mojave desert in California. This is not to
suggest that the Mojave should be covered with PV panels, but
to illustrate how small a land area PV panels would occupy to provide
                                all U.S. power.

The biggest challenge now facing PVs is to bring down their
cost. Already, the cost of PVs have dropped an impressive
20-fold (2000%) since the 1970s. To deliver electricity from PV
systems currently costs about $6 to $8 per watt (W). A drop to $3/W
                              would expand the market 1000 percent or more, and
                              a drop to $1/W would make PV systems competitive
                              against most other energy sources. It is entirely
                              feasible that PV power could be a major source of the
                              world's electricity within the next 25 years.

There are more than 90 million residential buildings in the U.S.
and that number is expected to rise to 130 million by 2030.
There is also 60 billion square feet of commercial building space in the
U.S., which includes offices, educational institutions, retail and
                           wholesale businesses, restaurants and warehouses.
                           These buildings, and the hundreds of millions of
                           appliances and equipment devices in them, directly and
                           indirectly consume 60 percent of all United States
energy.

The gas and electric bills for U.S. buildings exceed $180 billion
per year. All the residential buildings, and a large percentage
of the commercial buildings, could take advantage of various passive
solar and energy efficiency improvements, which this building has
                             done. The opportunity exists to save half or more of
                             the yearly energy expense for buildings, and in so
                             doing, greatly reduce environmental pollution,
                             increase comfort, create a more attractive living
                             space, and increase the resale value of buildings.

Passive solar is a body of design strategies that focus on making
the site and building itself act as an energy-saving system. The
passive solar "features" of a building are its walls, roof, windows,
floors and foundation. They are used for controlling convection,
                       conduction and radiation so as to heat, cool, ventilate and
                       light the building as desired during the course of the day
                       and year. Landscaping is considered an extended part of
                       the building, where properly placed trees, bushes and
                       vines block unwanted solar radiation and/or cold winter
winds. A passive building often looks very much like its more
conventional next door neighbor, but it performs much better.
Well-crafted passive solar homes are less drafty, more comfortable,
and provide higher quality natural light.

Natural design strategies are simple, mainstream building
techniques that include: good envelope performance (well
insulated walls, foundation, roof, floors); correct orientation to the sun
(so that the longest sides face north and south); proper placement and
                   sizing of glazings (e.g., minimize the amount of north-facing
                   glass in cold climates, use a relatively large amount of
                   south-facing glass with shading devices, and adequately
                   shade and/or insulate glass on the east and west sides);
                   addition of thermal mass in the building envelope (such as
                   concrete, adobe, brick, water walls, for absorbing heat
during the day and slowly releasing it at night); and, incorporate one
or more passive solar systems (such as a direct gain system, thermal
storage wall or sunspace.

The amount of energy savings by using passive solar features,
the cost of achieving these savings, and the financial return on
the investment through reduced utility bills will vary by location. This
chart, prepared for the Passive Solar Heating and Cooling
                            Collaborative in California, shows the cumulative
                            reductions in utility bills from these measures. The
                            heating bill declines by three-fourths and the cooling
bill is entirely eliminated. The $1340 in annual utility savings provides
a nearly 40% return on the $3556 initial investment, which is superior
to most returns on stocks and bonds.

Passive solar buildings focus on providing space comfort
(heating and cooling) and high quality daylighting. Making the
building as energy efficient as possible is a key component of passive
solar construction. Many super-insulated buildings are able to greatly
reduce the need for mechanical heating or air conditioners.
Low-energy consuming appliances also add to savings and pollution
prevention.
