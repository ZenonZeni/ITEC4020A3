<UL>
<LI>The Fund performed superbly all year long with an annual return that was 1.01% higher than that of the average fund in the Lipper Colorado Municipal Debt Funds peer group.  The Fund ranked in the top 10% of this group for the year.
<LI>New issue supply in the municipal bond market increased a great deal after election day, because a number of bond elections were passed by the voters of various cities and school districts.
<LI>Because net admissions into the Fund were minimal during the quarter, only a couple of new names were added to the Fund.  We made no major changes in the Fund during the last three months.
<LI>Longer duration and lower credit quality holdings were the best performing assets in the Fund during the fourth quarter.  Cash equivalents and mortgage revenue bonds were the worst performing sectors.
