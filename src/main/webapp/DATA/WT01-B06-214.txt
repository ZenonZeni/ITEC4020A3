  </H2>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> If you are interested in purchasing an American-made, finely crafted
  bicycle, Cannondale Corp. of Georgetown, CT, is your source. Unlike many
  of its competitors, Cannondale makes every single one of its bicycles distributed
  in the U.S. in its plants in Bedford and Phillipsburg, PA. Cannondale currently
  exports to over 60 countries. Cannondale began just 20 years ago, when president
  and founder Joe Montgomery and four staffers began hand-building bicycle
  trailers above a pickle factory. A year later, the small group began to
  hand-build bicycles. This year Cannondale celebrates its 25th year in business.
  Although Cannondale has grown significantly since its humble beginnings,
  Joe Montgomery's commitment to quality, innovation and a hand-built bicycle
  carries over to this day. </B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Cannondale bicycles feature patented, wide-girth, all-aluminum frames
  that make these bikes lighter, more efficient and more shock absorbing that
  a traditional steel frame bicycle. Cannondale was the first company to mass
  produce such a frame. Each Cannondale frame is computer designed and hand-built.
  It takes four hours and 40 pairs of human hands to manufacture a single
  Cannondale frame. Furthermore, every Cannondale frame features a lifetime
  guarantee.</B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> This year, Cannondale has introduced the Super V Active full-suspension
  mountain bike and the Slice monocoque carbon fiber road bike.</B>

  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Trek USA designs, engineers and manufactures high quality, technologically
  sophisticated bicycles in the United States. With global markets and a full
  line of high performance components and accessories, Trek is a leader in
  the sale of bicycles over $300 U.S. retail. Trek also manufactures the popular
  Gray Fisher line, and last year acquired the Gary Klein and Bontrager brands.
  Trek also manufactures a premium line of road bikes and accessories designed
  by three-time Tour de France winner Greg Le Mond. </B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Founded in a small barn in Waterloo, WI, in 1976, Trek Bicycle Corporation
  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intrepid Corporation, a privately held company
  located in Waukesha, WI. Begun with just five employees making hand-built
  bicycle frames, Trek USA has grown into a globally-oriented corporation.
  The majority of those employed by Trek work in its three Wisconsin manufacturing
  facilities. </B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Trek concentrates on developing state of the art bicycles, and in fact
  the Y bike, a full suspension mountain bike with a carbon fiber composite
  frame, was designed with technology that was pioneered in the development
  of the Stealth fighter. In 1995, Popular Mechanics magazine awarded the designers
  of the Y bike its Design Engineer of the Year Award. </B>

  <B> Litespeed produces some of the world's most technologically advanced,
  yet best-priced titanium road and mountain frames. This family business has
  its plant in Ooltewah, TN, and in fact all of Litespeed's mountain bikes,
  including the Ococee, Tellico and Hiwassee, are named after local Tennessee
  rivers. The company's commitment to value is reflected in the Hiwassee, which
  sports a full 3-2.5 Ti frame, front suspension, complete parts, and brilliant
  durable powdercoat finish- yet retails for under $1600, a price unheard just
  one year ago.</B>

  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> In 1971, Boston bike mechanic created his original version of the now-famous
  U-lock. Though it weighed a hefty 5 pounds, the lock's new design proved
  very effective. In fact, the Kryptonite U-Lock was installed in the permanent
  design collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and received the
  "Good Design" award in Japan. Kryptonite stands behind many of its products
  with an anti-theft guarantee offer of up to $1000.</B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B>And though the company had to withdraw this guarantee from covering Manhattan,
  NYC, the world's stolen bike capital, the company recently came out with
  its virtually indestructible New York lock, guaranteed throughout the U.S.
  and Canada. Kryptonite's highest security U-locks are produced in Canton,
  MA.</B>

  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B>Merlin Metalworks was founded in 1986 with the goal of building a new
  generation of bicycles that would combine high strength, unexcelled durability,
  light weight, and ride comfort in one frame. To achieve this goal, they selected
  an exceptionally strong titanium alloy originally developed for the U.S.
  aerospace industry and available only in the U.S.A. The result was the original
  Merlin mountain bike, the world's first aerospace titanium bicycle. The success
  of this design brought exponential growth, and today in addition to satisfying
  the requests of U.S. cycling enthusiasts, Merlin frames are exported to 38
  countries around the world. Fully half of the country's yearly production
  is sold overseas. In addition, the company maintains a full-time sales office
  in Leysin, Switzerland, to coordinate international sales, though every frame
  is still handcrafted in one factory in Cambridge, MA. Prices start at $1525,
  with top-of-the-line models retailing for $3000. Complete bicycles range
  from $2300 to $5500. </B>

  <B> Specialized makes some of its bikes and most of its components in Morgan
  Hill, CA. In fact, the flagship M2 Metal Matrix and all Specialized road
  bikes are made in the U.S., as are Body Geometry clothing, composite Rib
  Cage bottle cages, and Specialized bottles. But the company takes particular
  pride in its helmets, which are hand-assembled and hand-taped in Morgan Hill.
  Specialized helmet designers are constantly developing and testing new retention
  systems, and creating innovations such as the Brainlock and Headlock, which
  in 1995 won Bicycle magazine's award for "Best Retention System for Off-Road
  Helmets." </B>

  <B> Huffy Bicycles is the nation's largest bicycle manufacturer. It is also

  two manufacturing plants- one in Celine, OH, and the other in Farmington,
  MO.</B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Huffy produces bicycles in every category, from trikes to tandems. With
  innovative products for all cycling consumers, Huffy is equipped to meet
  the needs of today's riders. In addition to Huffy's products for mass market
  retailers, the company has also produced custom bicycles which have won Olympic,
  Pan Am and World Championship competitions. Much of the technological innovation
  needed to produce Huffy's world class racing bicycles has filtered down to
  Huffy's mass production models.</B>

  <B>Draftmaster Sportsracks have the advantages of roof-rack design- utilizing
  fork and rear tray mounts- but the accessibility of a traditional rear hitch
  rack. And because the bikes ride behind the vehicle, there's no aerodynamic
  drag, hence the name. Produced outside of Portland, OR, Draftmaster Sportsracks
  come in interchangeable two-, four-, and five-bike models, and have optional
  tandem, front-wheel, ski and snowboard attachments.</B>

  </H2>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Nett Designs, a commuter conscious bicycle accessory company in Vail,
  CO has designed a new rear bicycle rack meant for convenience, safety and
  versatility. The Load Llama Ultimate Bike Rack features expandable, rotating
  arms that form a sturdy frame basket or stable flat platform to accommodate
  objects of any shape. Designer Ted Simonett came up with the idea for the
  Load Llama in 1988 while hiking and biking in New Zealand. Frustrated by
  the dilemma of whether to carry his gear in a back pack for hiking convenience
  or in panniers for cycling ease, he improvised with aluminum shelving strips
  and a bungee cord to create a stable way to carry a large pack on his rear
  rack. </B>
  <P ALIGN=Left>
  <B> Nett Designs markets this rack to students and exercise-conscious,
  energy-aware commuters who ride their bikes to work or while doing errands.
  Load Llama is assembled in Colorado at an employment and training center
  for people with disabilities. </B>

  <B>Ringle Components of Trenton, NJ has been making high end aftermarket
  components for mountain and road bikes since 1989. Their product line consists
  of wheel hubs, complete wheels, wheel skewers, seatposts and seatpost binders,
  handle bar stems, water bottle cages, and steering headsets. Ringle products
  can be seen on many of the world's top mountain bike racers. In addition
  to working very closely with major suspension fork manufacturers to develop
  hub and dropout standards for the new generation of triple clamp suspension
  forks, Ringle continues to innovate. New products on the horizon include
  hub sets for disc brake technology and a new complete wheel system which
  uses straight pull titanium bladed spokes. Currently, Ringle exports to 36
  different countries.</B>
