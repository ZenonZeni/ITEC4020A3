If investing in the stock market involved one single, uninterrupted
climb in prices, there would be no risk involved. But stock prices
cannot be counted on to rise and certainly not in an orderly way. They
surge and they fall. 
<P>

The range that the stock market covers in a given year - the difference
between its high and low for the year - is a measure of a year's
volatility. Over the 1978 to 1994 period, "average" volatility of the
<A HREF="http://www.stockinfo.standardpoor.com/brochure/idxdirs.htm">Standard & Poor's 500</A> was about 25 percent, according to an analysis by
Kemper's Quantitative Research Department. (The S&P 500 is an unmanaged
index that's generally considered representative of the domestic stock
market.)  Yet since 1992, markets have been much 
less volatile. For example, volatility in the stock market, as represented by
the <A HREF="http://www.dowjones.com">Dow Jones Industrial Average</A>, was at a 95-year low in 1995, according to <I>Barron's.</I>
<P>

What's the significance of this? Kemper Portfolio Strategist Tom Regner
worries that such low levels of volatility have given investors -
especially new investors - unrealistic expectations about the degrees to
which their equity investments can fluctuate. Because the market has
historically been more volatile than its most recent performance, you
may want to give some thought to its potential for renewed volatility
and the impact volatility could have on your investments.
<P>

The following are a few suggestions on how you might prepare for
heightened stock market volatility:
<P>

<UL>
<LI> You could diversify. When you're concerned about your exposure in one
market, exposure to another market can help reduce the impact of
volatility. Instead of subjecting 100 percent of your portfolio to
what's going on in one market, a portion of your portfolio will move
with influences of a separate market.
<P>

Two other broad markets to invest in are the fixed-income markets and
international markets. Obviously, both represent their own risks and
potential rewards - and these markets can be volatile at times, as well.
For instance, the international markets present risks associated with
currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, you can help reduce the
riskiness of your investment strategy when you reduce your dependency on
a single market.
<P>

<LI> You could try to avoid volatility by moving some or a portion of your
investment in the stock market into a cash-type investment that seeks to
maintain the stability of the principal. A money market fund, for
example, is designed for investors who want to avoid the fluctuations
that are typical of the stock and bond markets. Although there can be no
assurance that it will, a money market fund seeks to maintain a stable
net asset value of $1.00 per share. Money market funds are neither
insured nor guaranteed by the U.S. government. 
<P>

Moving into such an investment can help limit your exposure to the
downside of volatility. The trade-off, however, is that you also will be
removed from benefiting when and if the market's volatility turns in the
investor's favor.
<P>

<LI> You could welcome volatility. Volatility has the potential to reward
the regular investor. Investors who prearrange to invest a fixed amount
into a mutual fund every month - regardless of the fund's share price -
can benefit from dips. How? When prices are low, your fixed investment
will buy more shares than could be bought when prices are high. Here's
the catch, however: The assumption is that the share price will bounce
back up and that you will still be invested if it does.
<P>

A program of regular investment cannot assure a profit or protect
against a loss in a declining market. Since this strategy (called dollar
cost averaging) involves continuing contributions regardless of
fluctuating share values, you'll need to consider your financial ability
to continue the program through periods of low price levels. For more
