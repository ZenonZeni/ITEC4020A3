UZBEKISTAN WELCOMES FOREIGN INVESTORS

Uzbekistan has put in place a legal framework conducive to encouraging
foreign investment. Elena Kirillova of McKenna & Co, London summarises
the key aspects of Uzbek legislation which a potential investor will
need to consider.

Uzbekistan is at the crossroads of Central Asia and a landlocked
country completely surrounded by countries which are also landlocked.
Despite its geographical position, since independence in 1991 its
relative political and economic stability, coupled with the
government's encouragement of foreign investment has resulted in a
steady increase in interest from foreign investors.

The legal framework is a key factor in encouraging investment in an
emerging market. In Uzbekistan, legislation has been changing to adapt
to the post-Soviet market reforms.

The Law On Foreign Investments

Article 11 of the Law On Foreign Investment dated 5 May 1994 provides
for a legislative guarantee that where laws are passed adversely
affecting foreign investment, "the laws in force on the day of initial
investment shall be applicable to foreign investments for 10 years".
This provision does not apply to "defence, national security, social
disorder and environmental protection".

This is an ambiguous provision, which can be interpreted as meaning
that such protection can be granted for a period less than 10 years. In
practice, the government authorities in Uzbekistan are interpreting
this provision as applying for a 10 year period.

A foreign investor's rights are "protected by law". Article 7 of the
Law provides that such protection is to be on "no less favourable terms
than those accorded to local entities". However, foreign investments
may be subject to expropriation in the case of "national calamities,
accidents and epidemics".

Compensation "adequate for the damages suffered" will be paid, although
the method for calculating this is not determined by existing
legislation.

Financial regulations and tax

Article 13 of the Law contains guarantees allowing investors to
"transfer abroad profits ... earned from legally authorised activities,
without any restrictions".

However, profits earned locally will not automatically be convertible
into hard currency. Due to government policy and a shortage of hard
currency, converting any significant amounts of local currency is
extremely difficult. Investors' profits can be "reinvested ... or used
in any other manner at the proprietor's discretion".

Accounts may be opened in any currency although the use of foreign
currency is restricted. Cash payments are not allowed and there is a
15% tax on gains from foreign currency sales.

Goods and equipment imported for production purposes or the personal
needs of foreign employees are exempt from customs duties.

Companies which are more than 30% foreign owned and which specialise in
the agricultural, construction and consumer industries are entitled to
a two year holiday from income tax.

Companies included in the Priority Investment Programme are entitled to
a five year income tax holiday. Inclusion in the Priority Investment
Programme is a matter of discretion exercised by the Cabinet of
Ministers.

According to the Enterprise Tax Law of 22 December 1995, the basic rate
of profits tax for companies with less than 30% foreign capital is 37%
and 25% for companies with more than 30% foreign capital.

Exporters receive further benefits in the President's Edict of 18 June
1994 "On measures to stimulate the activity of enterprises towards
broadening of export potential". Under this Edict, income tax is
payable at half the standard rate where exports comprise 30% of a
company's total output.

Additionally, certain benefits are available against tax levied on hard
currency revenues earned from exports, where exports have increased.

Further, export tariffs are reduced by 50% where goods are exported for
hard currency.

The Law On Concessions

The Law On Foreign Investments provides for concessions to be granted
to foreign investors wishing to exploit natural resources. The Law On
Concessions was passed on 30 August 1995 and provides a general
framework for concessions.

Under this Law, concessions are awarded to a company upon winning a
tender organised by the state management bodies of the relevant
industry sector. Also, the Cabinet of Ministers may allow a concession
agreement to be negotiated without a tender. Concession agreements are
usually valid for 15 years, with the possibility of extensions by the
Cabinet of Ministers.

There are some contradictions within the Law On Concessions. For
example, authorisation to enter into a concession is granted
simultaneously by authorised state management bodies and local
management bodies. The Law does not state which has responsibility in
particular circumstances.

Article 8 provides that the Cabinet of Ministers can determine priority
areas of concessionary activity, although no such determination has yet
been made. The registration procedure for concessions has not been
determined, although the Law states that concessions come into effect
from the moment of registration. The taxation regime is also not yet
developed regarding concessions.

It is also not clear if a foreign investor who is party to a concession
agreement is required to form a legal entity in Uzbekistan. Moreover,
some activities permissible under a concession agreement will require
additional licensing.

Legal structures

One of the issues facing foreign investors is the choice of appropriate
legal structure in Uzbekistan.

- Representative offices

Investors who do not propose to undertake income producing activities
can set up an accredited representative office. This is effectively an
extension of the parent company and, as such, has no separate legal
personality.

The kind of activities which a representative office would normally
undertake include the negotiation of co-operation or licensing
agreements on behalf of the parent company, undertaking marketing and
promotional work and by holding an export licence or obtaining visas or
customs exemptions for the parent company and its employees.

Representative offices are not entitled to trade. However,
representative offices can become liable for payment of income tax
where the parent company receives income as a result of its activities
in Uzbekistan.

The parent company will be responsible for the debts and obligations of
its representative office.

- Legal Entities

Two types of corporate structure are commonly used by investors: the
joint stock company and the limited liability company. There are some
notable differences between these structures.

In the case of a joint stock company, the charter fund (share capital)
is divided into shares. Each shareholder is allocated a certain
percentage of these which have a nominal value ascribed to them in the
company's founding documents.

A joint stock company can be either open (where shares are freely
transferable) or closed (where shares are distributed among founders,
and any change in the identity or number of founders will require the
execution of a new founders agreement and the re-registration of the
company).

The Presidential Decree of 21 January 1994 provided that the Cabinet of
Ministers develop a Programme for the Intensification of the
Denationalisation and Privatisation Processes which included enacting
regulations for closed joint stock companies to be transferred to open
joint stock companies. This Edict reflects the presidential policy of
encouraging wide public ownership of shares.

In contrast, limited liability companies do not issue shares. Instead,
each member, or "participant", takes an "interest" in the charter fund.
An interest is akin to a share, with similar rights and obligations
attached. Subject to the terms of legislation and to the founding
documents, "interests" may be sold to other participants, to outside
third parties or they may be redeemed by the company.

The framework of management is also different between the two forms of
company. The minimum requirement for a limited liability company is a
general meeting of participants (to be held at least twice per year)
and a directorate or general director. This latter body acts as the
executive organ of the company with full power to carry out the
decisions of the general meeting and to oversee the day-to-day running
of the business.

A joint stock company is required to have both a general meeting and
directorate or general director as well as a supervisory board. The
specific powers allocated to each of the three organs of the company
and their inter-relationships are to some extent set out in the
relevant company legislation.

However, there is still a degree of uncertainty as to how the three
bodies work in practice and the division of their spheres of
responsibility. For example, the roles of the directorate, which
handles the daily business of the company and is responsible for
implementing executive policies, and the supervisory board, which
oversees the activities of the directorate, seem to overlap and
problems can arise in practice if the founding documents of the company
are not sufficiently specific.

Registration

Both entities must be registered with the Ministry of Justice. In
addition, joint stock companies must register all issues of shares with
the Ministry of Finance and the National Depository, which makes the
accreditation process for such companies more complex.

The initial charter fund for both types of company must be paid in full
within one year of state registration. Each participant in a limited
liability company must pay up 30% of its cash contribution prior to
registration. This requirement does not apply to joint stock companies.

All documents required for the registration of an enterprise in
Uzbekistan should be submitted initially to the Ministry of Justice and
should include a feasibility study of the proposed venture.

If the proposed entity will involve state property, a resolution of the
State Committee for Property and the Support of Entrepreneurship will
be necessary.

However, the accreditation of companies with assets in excess of US$20
million, and all enterprises with 100% foreign investment must also be
notified to the Cabinet of Ministers.

The Ministry of Justice cannot register the company without the prior
approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. In practice, all companies with
foreign investment will require such approval.

Where the investment contemplated is of significant size or of
strategic importance to the Republic of Uzbekistan, the Cabinet of
Ministers may issue a decree approving the investment.

The decree procedure may allow an investor to seek additional
exemptions or guarantees, not available in existing legislation.
Additionally, companies must register with the Ministry for Foreign
Economic Relations when engaged in "overseas economic activity".

Practical considerations

The choice of corporate structure and the availability of additional
exemptions and guarantees will depend on the perceived importance of
the potential foreign investment to the Republic of Uzbekistan. While
the government encourages foreign investment, negotiations can take a
long time, in what is still a developing legislative environment.

A company wishing to invest in Uzbekistan will need to come to grips
with a great body of legislative and regulatory provisions. Each
significant new investment is still something of a precedent for the
Republic of Uzbekistan and there will be aspects which are not properly
regulated in the existing framework, and matters where the legislation
will be silent.

It is thus likely that the enactment of project-specific decrees will
remain a necessary part of structuring foreign investment in Uzbekistan
in the immediate future.

Companies need to be prepared to take an innovative and pragmatic
approach to succeed in this potentially rewarding market.

COMING TO GRIPS WITH SLOVAKIA'S LANGUAGE LAWS

A law regulating the use of the Slovak language is now in force in
Slovakia. Strict implementation of its provisions could lead to
increased costs for some businesses. By John Loughey of Squire Sanders
& Dempsey, Phoenix.

The Act on the State Language of the Slovak Republic (the Language
Law), Act No. 270/1995, passed by the National Council of the Slovak
Republic on 15 November 1995 and signed into law by President Michel
Kovac on 25 November 1995, has generated considerable controversy in
its short life, primarily relating to concerns about the effect of the
new law on Slovakia's Hungarian speaking ethnic minority.

Much less attention has been paid to the effect of the new Language Law
in international business and commerce. Although, for the majority of
businesses, the Language Law is unlikely to have a significant impact,
it may require major adjustments for businesses in certain industries
in Slovakia.

The Language Law, effective since 1 January 1996, provides that Slovak
is the official language in the Slovak Republic and takes priority over
other languages used in the Slovak Republic. It provides that official
use of the Slovak language must be in conformity with the codified form
of the language to be promulgated by the Slovak Ministry of Culture.

The main intent of the Language Law is to require the use of Slovak as
the official language in all government functions.

Although the Language Law specifically states that it is not intended
to regulate the use of languages of national minorities and ethnic
groups, and indeed Premier Vladimir Meciar and his government have
pledged to promulgate regulations dealing with the use of minority
languages, the Language Law's provisions requiring the use of Slovak in
education and government proceedings and making Slovak language ability
a pre-condition for government employment have generated the most
controversy among ethnic minorities.

These provisions are unlikely to be of concern to most foreign
investors. Other provisions of the Language Law, however, may have a
direct effect on certain businesses in Slovakia.

Mass media, broadcasting and publishing

The Language Law will have a significant impact on those businesses
operating in the broadcasting and publishing fields.

It provides that Slovak is the official language to be used in all
radio and television broadcasting in Slovakia. Foreign language radio
and television broadcasting with subtitles in Slovak or "otherwise
satisfying the requirement of basic comprehensibility from the
standpoint of the official language" are permitted, as are broadcasts
of music in the official language, foreign language transmissions by
Slovak Radio intended for foreign countries, and television and radio
broadcasting for the purposes of teaching a foreign language or for
similar purposes. (Presumably, the BBC and similar broadcasters who
broadcast foreign language programming from within Slovakia will be
permitted to continue such broadcasts on the rationale that they are
intended to teach foreign languages.) Radio and television broadcasting
operators, announcers, moderators and editors must use Slovak in their
broadcasts.

The Language Law does not provide any guidelines as to how a broadcast
would "otherwise satisfy the requirement of basic comprehensibility".

However, the "basic comprehensibility" exceptions in the Language Law
were added by last minute amendments as a result of lobbying by Czech
language interests.

It appears, therefore, that the intention of the exceptions is to
permit Czech language broadcasts. The Slovak language is similar to
Czech and many broadcasters in Slovakia use Czech subtitles or dubbing
on other foreign language programming. This practice will apparently be
permitted under the Language Law.

If strictly enforced, however, the Language Law may still have a
drastic effect on television broadcasting and cable companies operating
from within Slovakia. A strict interpretation of the Language Law would
prohibit local cable operators from retransmitting on their cable
systems such popular foreign language satellite programming as the
English language CNN or the German language RTL Plus without Slovak or
Czech dubbing or subtitling.

In addition, Slovak broadcasters would be unable to broadcast
programming from such international services without dubbing or
subtitling. Given the cost and practical difficulties of dubbing or
subtitling, Slovak broadcasters and cable operators, if faced with
strict enforcement, are likely to discontinue such programming, thereby
reducing the range of choices available to Slovak viewers. (The Slovak
National Council is currently considering a bill that would apply
similar restrictions to video taped films distributed in Slovakia.
Provided Czech dubbing or subtitling is permitted for these films, the
practical effect of the proposed law is likely to be minimal, because
most major video taped films distributed in Slovakia are either
subtitled or dubbed in Czech or Slovak).

Further, programming for children up to the age of 12 must be dubbed in
Slovak. Subtitles are not permitted nor is Czech dubbing. As a result,
the range of children's programming available in Slovakia may be
reduced.

As with the broadcast industries, the print and publishing industry
will be affected by the Language Law, which provides that periodical
and non-periodical publications must be published in Slovak. The "basic
comprehensibility" exception does not apply to such publications.
Consequently, publishing companies may face the additional expense of
producing Slovak translations of publications when, in the past, they
have sold only the Czech translation in Slovakia.

Lectures, seminars and cultural events

Organisations that sponsor lectures, seminars or other educational,
training or cultural events will also be affected by the Language Law.
Such events must be held in Slovak or, if in another language, in a
manner in which the "basic comprehensibility from the standpoint of the
official language is satisfied".

Again, the Language Law provides no guidance as to what meets the
requirement of "basic comprehensibility". Presumably, however,
translations of foreign language presentations into Slovak should
satisfy this requirement in addition to presentations in Czech.

An exception is provided for touring foreign artists, cultural events
of national minorities and ethnic groups, and musical works in their
original language, provided such programs are first introduced in
Slovak. (Paradoxically, the Language Law would permit Slovak rock bands
to perform the music of an American rap group in English, but would ban
a Slovak based theatre group from performing Shakespeare in English).

Participants at lectures have the right to express themselves and
present speeches in Slovak. Printed materials for cultural events and
other special occasions, including programs for cinemas, theatres and
concerts must be issued in Slovak. They may, however, contain
translations in other languages.

If the Language Law is strictly enforced, those organisations that
sponsor seminars and lectures in Slovakia may face additional expenses
in these operations. These organisations may be required to provide
Slovak translators for any programs held in Slovakia, even if all
participants in the program are fluent in the foreign language in which
the program is conducted.

Contracts and similar documents

The Language Law will require several types of contracts and other
documents to be in Slovak that the parties might not otherwise execute
in Slovak.

All employment contracts and other agreements related to labour
relations must be in Slovak. This requirement would apply even in
employment contracts between a foreign-owned Slovak company and its
Slovak resident foreign employee if those contracts are entered into in
Slovakia.

All financial and technical documentation must be in Slovak. Although
the requirement prior to the Language Law was that financial statements
used for official purposes such as tax returns were to be prepared in
Slovak, other financial statements, such as those prepared according to
international accounting standards and used for international purposes,
were often prepared only in English and another foreign language.

The official language of court proceedings will, of course, be Slovak,
and non-Slovak speaking foreigners will continue to have a right to use
interpreters.

Of major significance to international business, however, is the new
requirement that, in any proceeding before public authorities
(including courts) relating to a contract, only the Slovak version of
the contract will be recognised.

It is common practice in international transactions for the contracts
to be prepared either in both a foreign language and in Slovak, with
the foreign language version controlling, or only in the foreign
language.

The Language Law mandates that the court must recognise only the Slovak
language version of the contract, despite any clear expression that the
intent of the parties is to the contrary.

This provision of the Language Law may lead to an increased use of
arbitration in international transactions in an effort to avoid the
application of this particular provision of the Language Law.

Product packaging and documentation

The Language Law requires that all information and documentation for
consumer goods, foods and medicines, including the listing of the
contents, instructions for their use, and warranty conditions, be in
Slovak. Presumably, this documentation may also be in other languages.

This particular provision would not be a major change from existing
practice for most (but not all) importers. Most importers provide
Slovak language documentation in order to reach the widest possible
market in Slovakia. This provision of the Language Law would, however,
prohibit the use of Czech documentation in place of Slovak language
documentation, as has sometimes been the practice for companies in
order to save the cost of translating materials into Slovak.

Computer software

The provisions of the Language Law relating to product documentation
may have a major impact on producers and distributors of computer
software, although the Language Law has no provisions expressly
applicable to computer software. According to Milan Ferko, the Director
of the Section of State Languages and Scripts of the Slovak Ministry of
Culture, (the ministry with responsibility for supervising compliance
with the Language Law), producers and distributors of computer software
must provide Slovak versions of computer programs. In addition, the
computer programs must permit the use of the Slovak alphabet. This
requirement may limit Slovakia's access to new programs when the
expense of developing a Slovak language version is deemed to be too
high by the software producer.

Advertising

Signs, advertisements and notices in stores, sporting arenas, cafes,
streets, airports, train stations and means of public transport must be
in Slovak. Other languages may be included, provided such other
languages follow the Slovak text and are not larger than the Slovak
text. The current practice of some advertisers of using slogans in a
foreign language only will no longer be permitted. This will require
advertising campaigns especially developed for the Slovak market.
Further, the Slovak language must be used even if the advertising is
directed solely to foreigners, as is commonly seen in advertising at
airports.

Penalties for violations

Although the Language Law came into effect on 1 January 1996, the
provisions of the Language Law relating to penalties for its violation
will not come into effect until 1 January 1997. After 1 January 1997,
the Ministry of Culture will have the authority to impose fines up to
SKK 250,000 (US$8,500) for most violations. For violations of the
provisions imposed upon broadcasters relating to children's programming
and local television and radio broadcasting, fines can be imposed up to
SKK 500,000.

Increasing the costs of business

Despite the controversy concerning the effect of the Law on minorities
in Slovakia, the Language Law will not have a significant impact on
most businesses.

In some instances, however, the new Language Law, if strictly enforced,
may increase the cost of doing business in Slovakia because of
requirements for translation into Slovak of documentation, broadcast
programming, lectures and presentations, advertising and, possibly,
computer software programs. Given the relatively small market of Slovak
speakers, some businesses may feel that the additional cost thus
imposed is unjustified and decide to forego the Slovak market as a
result. Other businesses might pass the increased cost on to Slovak
consumers. As with the effect of the law on minorities, the real impact
of the Language Law will depend on how it is implemented and enforced.

BULGARIA: NEW EXPORT RESTRICTIONS SET TO BE INTRODUCED

The government has issued new trade regulations containing revised
restrictions on the import and export of commodities.

The main features are as follows:

- export of the following products are banned until the end of this
year:- wheat, flour, cooking oil, oil-bearing crops and crops used for
animal feed. The ban on wheat exports is likely to create problems for
Bulgaria in its efforts to join the World Trade Organisation;

- new quotas have been set for duty free imports of wheat, flour,
maize, sunflower seeds and beef while there are no longer any quotas on
ice cream imports;

- imports of sausages and powdered milk must be registered;

- in accordance with its obligations under EU trade agreements, customs
duties on Bulgarian industrial goods to the EU will be abolished this
year. Textiles are, however, not included and will continue to attract
duties at least until 1997;

- the ban on the export of some metals (eg, zinc, aluminium and nickel)
will be replaced by export duties. Trade in metals with the EU is
subject to licensing requirements while scrap exports remain banned;
and

- EU quotas on the import of live sheep and live goats have been
increased.

CZECH REPUBLIC: CHANGE IN REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPANIES

Companies seeking registration must apply from 1 January 1996 to public
registers maintained by regional courts rather than district courts as
was previously required.

Regional courts, which usually hear commercial disputes at first
instance, operate in the main centres such as Prague, Brno and Ostrava.

District courts, which are not normally involved in commercial
proceedings, were seen as inappropriate administrators of the
commercial register.

The road use tax, which was abolished last July, has been reintroduced
effective 1 January 1996.

The rate for most commercial companies is 0.5% of turnover.

However, insurance companies are subject to a tax equivalent to 0.5% of
the previous year's income while the rate for trading companies is 0.1%
of turnover for the preceding month.

KAZAKHSTAN: CHANGES TO EMPLOYER SOCIAL SECURITY CONTRIBUTIONS

The 1996 budget requires employers to make payments to a medical
insurance fund from 1 January 1996.

Currently, employers contribute to pension and social security schemes
on behalf of employees.

However, the overall burden to make contributions has not been
increased. Contributions in total will not exceed 30% of gross wages as
at present.

Payments to individual funds have been re-allocated with 25.5%
earmarked for pensions, 1.5% for social security funds and 3% to
medical insurance fund.

MOLDOVA: DEVELOPMENT OF SECURITIES MARKET AND STOCK EXCHANGE

Integral to the success of Moldova's mass privatisation programme,
which has entered its second phase, is the development of a functioning
stock market.

The Moldova Stock Exchange (MSE) opened in May last year with five
listed companies. That number is expected to grow as privatised and
other qualifying companies seek listings.

A legislative framework has also emerged, although a number of
significant changes are in the pipeline. Preparation began with the May
1993 Law on Circulation of Securities and Stock Exchanges (as amended,
the Securities Law) which creates a basic framework of securities
market regulation. Recently ratified amendments to this law, along with
corresponding amendments (still awaiting passage) to the Law On Joint
Stock Companies (the JSC Law), reflect anticipated use by companies of
stock market mechanisms. A more comprehensive securities law is under
consideration, although its passage has been delayed by debate over the
establishment and operation of over-the-counter markets.

Scope of Securities Law

Securities are defined as instruments representing equity rights and
certain debt obligations, which usually provide the holder with
periodic or defined dividend or interest payments and are transferable.

Securities may exist in materialised or dematerialised (book-entry)
form, and may be issued in registered or bearer form. The exchange of
securities includes their purchase and sale and other activities
defined by law where a change of ownership is or may be effected (which
would embrace such instruments as options or futures contracts).

Securities registries must be maintained to reflect the issuance,
exchange and pledge of securities.

Competent securities issuers are joint stock companies, banks and state
bodies, although others may be designated by law. Subject to certain
regulatory requirements, foreign institutions and individuals may
participate in the market on a par with Moldovan entities.

Only specified domestic securities may be issued or circulate in the
Moldovan market under the Securities Law. These include shares and
bonds issued by joint stock companies, bonds issued by other types of
enterprises and such other securities designated by the SCSM.

Foreign-issued securities may also be allowed onto the Moldovan market,
although this is subject to a number of regulatory requirements
including authorisation from the National Bank of Moldova.

Other forms of securities include:

- government bonds;
- treasury or treasury-like bonds;
- bank certificates;
- promissory notes and bills of exchange;
- other documentary evidences of commercial obligation; and
- special MPP enterprise-specific securities.

The following are not debt security instruments:

- simple debt receipts;
- testamentary dispositions;
- lottery tickets; and
- insurance policies.

The issuance of state securities is regulated by the Ministry of
Finance and the NBM, and their exchange by the Securities Law. Some
bank-related securities, such as bills of exchange, may be under NBM
jurisdiction.

Chief among the Securities Law amendments is the creation of securities
registry systems. A registry must contain details of owners or nominal
holders of securities. Amendments to the JSC Law set out obligations of
joint stock companies in relation to the establishment and maintenance
of registries. Issuers may maintain their own registries or use the
services of an independent SCSM-licensed registrar. Nominal securities
holders, who must also be SCSM-registered, may also perform registry
functions. Securities transfers are valid only when all registration
requirements under the law have been completed.

Securities issuance

Securities issues must be registered with the SCSM and given a public
file number. Thirty days prior to registration of the issue, the
following documents must be submitted to the SCSM:

- the registration application describing security type, quantity and
face value;

- an extract from Ministry of Justice Enterprises Registry certifying
the issuer's existence;

- certified copies of the issuer's constituent documents;

- security specimens; and

- the issue prospectus.

The prospectus must be approved by the SCSM prior to distribution to
potential investors. The SCSM will review the prospectus, which must be
current to within three months of publication, and may require
additions or deletions to it.

A copy of the prospectus must be made available to each interested
investor. Any amendments made during the securities offering period
must approved by the SCSM and provided to investors holding prospectus
copies. During the initial offering period (which is not defined),
securities must be sold at face value. The SCSM may suspend or declare
invalid an issue in the event of a breach of legislation, false
information in the prospectus or a material change in the condition of
the issuer or issue terms and conditions. This decision is subject to
judicial review. The Securities Law sets out detailed reporting
requirements, which include keeping details of all corporate activities
and filing annual reports with the SCSM.

Securities exchange

Securities exchange activities may only be undertaken by persons
licensed by the SCSM. Banks and companies whose sole corporate activity
is securities dealing may apply for a trading licence from the SCSM.
They must be able to demonstrate professional competence in the
activities they wish to pursue and may not be more than 10% owned or
controlled by another SCSM licence holder.

A bank may engage in dealing for its own account only and may not deal
in securities of issuers which are bank customers or clients.

Recent amendments to the Securities Law and JSC Law concern large-scale
securities issues, the operation of independent registries, over-the-
counter trading and disclosure requirements.

A large-scale securities issue is one where the number of registered
securities holders exceeds 300 (individual shareholders of nominees
counting against the limit).

Open joint stock companies involved in such issues must register the
issue with the MSE. Issuers of such securities are obliged to contract
responsibility for issuance and exchange registration activities to an
SCSM-licensed independent registrar. Such a registrar is defined by
amendments to the JSC Law as a legal person whose sole corporate
activity is engaging in issuance and registry activities. An
independent registrar is precluded from transacting in client
securities or sub-contracting any of its clients' responsibilities.

OTC exchange activity in large scale securities issues by joint stock
companies must be performed by the SCSM licensed persons who must
report to the regulator the manner and volume of trades executed.
Disclosure requirements, which are still to be determined by the
government, will bind persons engaged in securities issuance and
dealing.

The stock exchange

The MSE is established as a closed joint stock company and is therefore
subject to the JSC Law in relation to internal corporate governance.

Stock exchange activities are subject to SCSM supervision.

Founders of the Moldova Stock Exchange, whose number shall not exceed
ten, must be SCSM-licensed market participants.

The founders must establish a general guaranty fund to which exchange
members must contribute. Assets of the fund may not be used to cover
the general debt obligations of an exchange member (except as
prescribed by exchange regulations) where membership is terminated
because of liquidation, bankruptcy or otherwise. The MSE has a priority
claim over the former member's guaranty share to satisfy obligations
associated with exchange activity.

MSE members must be SCSM-licensed market participants. They must
satisfy MSE regulations regarding financial and operational capacity
and agree to abide by the MSE charter and rules.

Members are not obliged to hold shares in the MSE. Membership may be
sold or voluntarily relinquished. The MSE may cancel a member's
licence, suspend its activities or revoke membership for failure to
abide by MSE regulations. Appeal lies with the SCSM.

MSE income is used to defray exchange operational expenses. Conflict of
interest provisions prohibit the holding of management or other
official positions in the MSE by persons holding shares in a MSE
member.

No MSE employee may also be employed by a securities issuer, including
government treasury bond issuers.

The MSE shall cease to exist by a vote of the general assembly of
shareholders, where membership falls below ten persons and within the
preceding six months no new members have been admitted, or upon SCSM
revocation of the MSE's licence.

Investor protection

Investors are protected against losses suffered as a result of false
information provided to them in the initial share offering -
presumably, only by reference to the issuer's published prospectus.

Where a licensed market participant knowingly certifies as true false
information on the issuer, the participant and the issuer shall be
liable to the investor. Investor remedies include compensation or,
where the investor files the claim within a month of the affected
securities purchase, revocation of the securities sales contract. As
regards initial share issues, the issuer and other market participants
involved in the transaction must maintain purchase monies received by
them in escrow until such time as they are satisfied that no violation
of the investor protection provisions is likely to occur. A person
purchasing 5% or more of a company's voting stock or increasing an
existing holding through voting share purchases by 5% or more, must
report such activity within five days of its occurrence to the SCSM.

Joint stock companies purchasing their own stock on the open market
must inform the SCSM within 15 days of the completed transaction.

As regards open market share buy-backs by joint stock companies, the
proposed amendments to the JSC Law requires the company charter to
specifically authorise such buy-backs as well as approval of the action
by the board of directors. The board may only approve the buy-back
where the company is unlikely to become insolvent or where the buy-back
would not provoke insolvency. Repurchased shares must be retired to
treasury. A company may not purchase shares in a primary issue. The
foregoing directives are not specifically provided for, but may be
deduced from current JSC Law read with the Securities Law and general
civil law principles of corporate governance.

Insider trading is prohibited to certain listed categories of persons
associated with an issuer, subject to an exception clause which
seriously undermines the prohibition's effect.

Persons having access to "official information" (an undefined term) of
an issuer, who are forbidden from engaging in insider trading activity,
are categorised as follows:

- "issuers authorities", a grouping which includes member of a
company's supervisory council or board of directors and administrative
personnel;

- officials engaged in auditing functions in connection with issuers or
the MSE;

- SCSM authorities or officials; and

- authorities and officials of the MSE and professional SCSM-licensed
market participants.

"Authorities" and "members" are not defined. Such persons and members
of their families may purchase securities of associated issuers
provided that they sell or transfer them within six months of purchase.
Banks issuing securities may not provide credit to investors in those
securities. It is prohibited to disseminate false information about an
issuer with a view to profiting from a resultant share price swing.

Investors suffering losses may bring a claim against the individual or
company disseminating the information by reference to as yet undrafted
legislation. Any pledge of securities must be recorded in the issuer's
share registry.

Securities watchdog

The SCSM is the main regulator with its mandate expanded under
Securities Law amendments giving it wider regulatory and investigatory
powers.

Recently added powers include:

- approving new MSE rules;

- investigative authority over activities by market participants with a
view to uncovering or pursuing suspected irregularities or illicit
behaviour, coupled with documentary and written deposition subpoena
powers; and

- certain proactive remedial powers.

Appeal from SCSM orders lies with the general and arbitral courts by
reference to the order's terms.

Transitional provisions

The government is directed to submit draft amendments to the JSC Law to
Parliament for approval and to bring regulations under the JSC Law and
Securities Law into compliance with the amended Laws.

As mentioned, amendments to the JSC Law are still under discussion.
Regulations are being updated to reflect recent changes to the
Securities Law and discussions on a second wholly redrafted securities
law are well advanced.

RUSSIA: REGISTRATION IN ST PETERSBURG

Russian companies with foreign investment located in St Petersburg
(including their branches and representative offices), as well as
branch offices of foreign companies, are now registered in the same
manner as most other local Russian commercial entities by the St
Petersburg Registration Chamber.

Under prior legislation, companies with foreign investment and branches
and representative offices of foreign companies were registered at a
separate registration chamber at the Committee of Foreign Relations of
the Mayor's Office (the CFR). Now only representative offices of
foreign legal entities need be CFR registered.

The new registration process has formally been in effect since the
publication on 25 July 1995 of the Order of the Mayor of St. Petersburg
Executive Organs in Relation to State Registration of Juridical
Entities as well as Physical Persons Engaged in Individual Commercial
Activities Not Having Formed a Juridical Entity in the Form of an
Individual Enterprise (Order 692-p), which attaches the new Regulation
of the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber. However, its provisions
were not implemented immediately and its interpretation by the
Registration Chamber and CFR became clear only recently.

Order 692-p establishes that the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber
has responsibility for registering and maintaining a unified registry
of all new and reorganised juridical entities in St. Petersburg
(including those with foreign investment) as well as branches and their
representative offices, including the branch offices (but not
representative offices) of foreign entities. Specifically included in
the competence of the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber is the right
to register all of the aforementioned entities as well as to confirm
either the amendments to the foundation documents or the liquidation
balance in case of the dissolution of any entities previously
registered by the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber or the CFR.

As to the timing of the registration process, previously, the CFR
reviewed the application documentation over a 21-day period in
accordance with the provisions of the Law on Foreign Investment in the
RSFSR of 4 July 1991 and the Regulations on the Order of Registration
of Enterprises with Foreign Investment on the Territory of St.
Petersburg as attached to Order of the Mayor of St. Petersburg no. 219-
p of 14 March 1994 On the Registration of Enterprises with Foreign
Investment which Order 692-p partially repeals.

Subsequently, the legality of this waiting period was brought into
question by Decree No. 1482 of the President of 8 July 1994 On the
Order of State Registration of the Subjects of Entrepreneurial Activity
(Decree 1482) which requires that the registration organ complete the
registration process no later than three days after submission of the
required documentation.

The wording of Order 692-p appears to ignore Decree 1482, by implicitly
granting to the St. Petersburg Registration Chamber the right to review
application documentation over a 21-day waiting period as well.
Experience since the publication of Order 692-p has been that in some
cases, where all documents have been in order, registrations have been
completed within several days following their submission. The
documentation required to register a Russian company with foreign
investment (including its branch and representative offices) or a
branch office of a foreign company remains unchanged, except for the
application letter, which must now be addressed to the St. Petersburg
Registration Chamber. Also, as before, companies having foreign
investment in the charter capital exceeding Rbs 100 million must
complete the registration process at the Registration Chamber of the
Ministry of Economics in Moscow.
