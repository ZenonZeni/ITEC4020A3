Sony Pictures to enter video CD software market in March+

TOKYO, Dec. 25 Kyodo

     Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan) Inc. said Monday it will
enter the market for video compact disk (CD) software March 21,
introducing 10 movie titles.
     Sony Pictures, a domestic movie unit of electronics giant Sony
Corp., said the 10 titles are ''Stand By Me,'' ''Easy Rider,'' ''Taxi
Driver,'' ''The Addams Family,'' ''Kramer vs Kramer,''
''Ghostbusters,'' ''Last Action Hero,'' ''No Way Out,'' ''Silence of
the Lambs'' and ''Robocop.''
     Based on the Motion Picture Experts Group-1, or MPEG-1, standard
for data compression, video CDs are 12-centimeter compact disks which
hold a maximum of 74 minutes of audio and digital full-motion video.
     It is becoming increasingly easier to play such CDs on
audiovisual equipment and personal computers.

Japanese electronics transplants overseas total 1,062+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     The number of overseas production bases operated by major
Japanese electronics makers totaled 1,062 at the end of June this
year, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan reported
Tuesday.
     The association said the figure is based on a survey of 436
member companies.
     It said 690 or 65% of the total were located in Asia, 194 in
North America and 138 in Europe.
     The association said a total of 282 Japanese affiliates were in
operation in China and Malaysia.
     The expansion overseas by Japanese electronics firms was
prompted by the yen's steep appreciation in the early 1990s, the
association said.
     The number stood at 770 in 1990, it said.
     ''The time has come for the Japanese makers to reorganize their
production bases in Asia, but the number of production bases to be
opened by them in the region will continue to increase, though at a
slower pace,'' the association said.
     The association said the Japanese affiliates were located in 43
countries around the world as of June 1995, with the United States
accounting for 153, topping the nation-by-nation list.
     Workers employed by the Japanese affiliates totaled 766,000,
including about 7,000 dispatched from Japan, the association said.
     It said 55 research and development affiliates were located in
North America and 25 in Asia.

Foreign appliance makers to launch sales blitz: paper+

TOKYO, Dec. 26 Kyodo

     Foreign consumer electronics makers are gearing up to boost
sales in Japan, introducing lower-priced products in electrical
discount stores throughout the country, a business daily reported
Tuesday.
     General Electric Co. (GE) of the United States will expand into
the western Japan market following its strong performance in eastern
Japan, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.
     In June GE started selling refrigerators through Kojima Co., a
major Japanese home-appliance retail chain.  Brisk sales of 10,000
refrigerators a month have prompted GE to consider advancing into
western Japan, the daily said.
     The company will shortly enter into a tie-up with Daiichi Corp.,
Japan's third largest retailer of consumer electronics goods and
based in Hiroshima, according to the paper.
     The consumer electronics titan plans to offer not only
refrigerators but microwave ovens and air conditioners as well in
western Japan.
     Whirlpool Corp., another major U.S. appliance maker, has
launched sales of low-priced microwave ovens through Kato Denki Co.,
a discount store operator based in Mito, Ibaraki Prefecture, that
handles consumer electronics.
     South Korean appliance makers Samsung Electronics Co. and LG
Electronics are poised to begin selling lower-priced, wide-screen
television sets at large-scale retailers in suburban areas early next
year, the daily said.
     Samsung will put on sale 24-inch and 28-inch TVs that are
gaining popularity in Japan, with its overall 1996
consumer-electronics sales target for the Japanese marketplace at 21
billion yen, a 50% surge from this year's figures.
     Prices for the company's wide-screen TVs are likely to be set
at around 100,000 yen, or 20 to 30% lower than similar domestic
models.
     Meanwhile, LG Electronics is in negotiation with domestic
retailers for introduction of its 20-inch TVs in Japan, the paper
said.
