<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>1. WHAT IS VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>When we hear the phrase <I>voluntary euthanasia</I> people
generally think of one of two things: the active termination of life at
the patient's request as it occurs in the Netherlands (or similar proposals
in other countries); or the Nazi extermination program of murder. Many
people have <I>beliefs</I> about whether euthanasia is right or wrong,
often without being able to define it clearly. Some people take an extreme
view, while many fall somewhere between the two camps. Dictionary definitions
avail us little, as there will always be large groups of people that claim
it means something else. The apparent derivation <I>a gentle and easy death</I>
(from the Greek, eu - thanatos) hardly describes what we mean. Even extending
the definition to include <I>bringing about of this, especially in the
case of incurable and painful disease</I> (Oxford English Dictionary) hardly
covers it - hospices often succeed in bringing about a peaceful death,
but they don't perform euthanasia! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the Netherlands, the only country where euthanasia
is openly practised, euthanasia is defined as &quot;the intentional termination
of life by another at the explicit request of the person who dies&quot;
(Netherlands State Commission on Euthanasia). The argument then often centres
on the voluntariness of the request. How can one be sure that it is voluntary?
Supporters of the voluntary euthanasia movement generally believe that it
would be possible to devise sufficient safeguards to ensure that the request
was voluntary and that people could never feel pressured. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Dutch are critical of their own system and are continually
refining and testing it - though generally they feel that it respects human
rights and is part of good medicine. They get rid of the word <I>voluntary</I>
since the <I>explicit request</I> is part of their definition of euthanasia.
An explicit request is objectively observable, whereas voluntariness depends
somewhat on interpretation. (Some opponents of euthanasia suggest that
the true will is impaired if one is asking to die and that therefore there
is no <I>voluntariness</I>. Most people would agree if the person was emotionally
distraught over, say, being jilted by a lover, or if the person was psychiatrically
of unsound mind, but most of us view more considered statements as voluntary,
especially if we are unable to find any evidence to the contrary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Obviously the Dutch definition needs careful implementation
to ensure <I>voluntariness</I>, and the Dutch attempt to do this by a series
of safeguards within a close doctor-patient relationship, a high standard
and availability of palliative care, and general public support. There
is much debate over whether we could have a similar system in, say, Britain,
but we feel that the present system is unsatisfactory and so we press for
reform. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One of the few certainties of life is death, but in the
twentieth century it is still a taboo subject. The &quot;forbidden&quot;
nature of death adds to the unnamed fears and worries that most people
feel when asked to confront the idea of their own death. Yet once people
can overcome their reluctance to discuss the subject, most often what is
revealed is not the fear of death itself, but the manner of dying. The
difficulty of thinking about &quot;death with dignity&quot; is that it
implies that one day you, or someone you love, may be in a position to
want that choice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>No one can prevent death finally, but we can and should
ensure that the dying process is a gentle and peaceful one. When life consists
of a few agonising, drugged weeks, many patients beg their doctors to help
them die, and many doctors, mindful of the ethics of their profession,
feel forced to refuse. Those who, out of compassion, accede to such a request,
know they are breaking the law and putting their careers at risk. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is the dilemma which faces all of us now. Should
we, as potential patients, have the legal right to ask our doctors to help
us die when the end of life is in sight and our suffering severe? <BR>

<HR><A NAME="2"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>2. WHY THE NEED FOR SOCIETIES?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>In England, The Voluntary Euthanasia Society was founded
in 1935 by the late Dr C. Killick Millard M.D., DSc. Its principal object
was to make it legal for an adult person, who is suffering severe distress
from an incurable illness, to receive medical help to die at their own
considered request. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In 1980 Scottish Exit (now the Voluntary Euthanasia Society
of Scotland or VESS) became an independent group, and published &quot;How
to Die With Dignity&quot;. This booklet, by Dr George Mair, was the first
guide to self deliverance in the world. An updated version, together with
the well-researched modern supplement &quot;Departing Drugs,&quot; is still
available to members of at least three months' standing, as long as they
specifically request it. Members can receive the booklet in Scotland, England
or anywhere in the world. VESS also acts as a centre and focus for research
concerning medical decisions at the end of life, and particularly living
wills. The VESS Newsletter is considered a leading source of information.
VESS can provide information and support to members of the public, doctors,
lawyers, educational institutions and students, politicians and the media.
Individuals should note, however, that while seeking a change of the law,
we will only act within the law as it stands. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The history of reform shows that humane and well-argued
proposals only tend to pass into law when there is a strong public voice
behind them. The people who struggle against inhumanity make their mark
by creating a better world. We can't help those who have died in abject
suffering, but we can work for the good of those whose death is yet to
come - not only by striving for better, caring services, but by restoring
control to the individual who has entered the last phase of life. <BR>

<HR><A NAME="opinion"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>3. IS THERE GROWING SUPPORT FOR THE MOVEMENT?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>A National Opinion Poll, in April 1993, showed that 81% of
Scots agree with our aims for a change in the law. A phone-in after a TV
programme gave a figure of 93% in agreement, from a total of 23,000 calls.
A survey published in the British Medical Journal in 1994 showed that a
considerable number of doctors are already acceding to requests for active
voluntary euthanasia. Many more doctors feel that a change in the law is
overdue. Yet any move towards legislation of Voluntary Euthanasia has so
far been blocked by opponents. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Opposing voices tend to reveal an ignorance of the true
nature of VOLUNTARY euthanasia. Misunderstandings abound, and we hope in
this leaflet to lift and remove any fears and misapprehensions. If you
wish to write or phone, we are also glad to answer any queries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>International support is growing rapidly. A number of
countries are actively considering legislative reform. Right-to-Die Societies
around the world have increasing support from the swiftly growing numbers
of individuals demanding their rights to self-determination. <BR>
<I><A HREF="#c">Back to Contents</A></I></FONT> 
<HR><A NAME="4"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>4. DOES THE SOCIETY ENCOURAGE EUTHANASIA FOR THE OLD
AND INFIRM?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>There can be no voluntary &quot;euthanasia&quot; if any persuasion
is present. In all humane societies there is proper provision for caring
for the elderly and infirm. Such facilities are also paid for out of taxes
in a normal working life, and an individual has a right to choose to benefit
from these services - the individual has the right to choose the type of
care he or she would like, or to decline further treatment. No one should
be driven to contemplate suicide through lack of service, care or support.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While it is often the old and infirm who choose self-deliverance,
the choice has been made in the light of each individual's quality of life.
Love of life is a primitive instinct: no one should be persuaded to die
through propaganda. But a conviction, deeply held for whatever reason,
that the time has come, should be respected, and everyone should have the
right to choose release. <BR>
<I><A HREF="#c">Back to Contents</A></I></FONT> 
<HR><A NAME="5"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>5. I WANT TO DIE. PLEASE CAN THE SOCIETY HELP ME?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>VESS is not a suicide club. As a pressure group we seek to
bring about a change in the law, but we must act, and be seen to be acting,
within the law. Neither do we encourage suicide stemming from irrational
or emotional impulses. Although we have no formal association with the
Samaritans, we urge any emotionally traumatised individual contemplating
suicide to get in touch with them. We also stress the importance of clear
and full diagnosis of existing conditions if a person is already ill. <BR>
<I><A HREF="#c">Back to Contents</A></I></FONT> 
<HR><A NAME="6"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>6. WHAT DOES VESS FEEL ABOUT MALFORMED BABIES, THE MENTALLY
HANDICAPPED OR THE INCURABLY INSANE?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>VESS seeks only the legislation of voluntary euthanasia.
Handicapped babies, and the mentally retarded cannot make that voluntary
decision, and so are not included in our remit. VESS also presses equally
strongly for safeguards against any type of so-called euthanasia that does
not stem from a clear, well-informed and voluntary request on the part
of the individual. We stand for freedom of choice, and this also includes
that of individuals and doctors who are opposed to our views but do not
seek to impose those views on others. <BR>
<I><A HREF="#c">Back to Contents</A></I></FONT> 
<HR><A NAME="7"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>7. WHY DO YOU NEED VOLUNTARY EUTHANASIA WHEN THERE IS
THE HOSPICE MOVEMENT?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>There have been enormous advances in the care of the terminally
ill, and for many, the lucky ones who find a place in a hospice, this has
proved adequate to ensure that they come to a peaceful and dignified end.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unfortunately, even with medical advances and excellent
hospice research in palliative care, severe indignity, pain and distress
cannot always be controlled. The hospices' most optimistic estimate for
pain control is 95%. In practice, in ordinary hospitals, it may be as low
as 30%. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are conditions such as cancer, strokes, acute arthritis,
and more recently AIDS, to name just a few, where all the medical skills
in the world aren't enough for a particular individual case. If that person,
after undergoing all possible treatment, still feels enough is enough,
they should have the right to be helped to die. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The phrase &quot;terminal illness&quot; suggests a way
of looking at death, not at the moment of brain death, but as a process
lasting some period of time; once this more realistic view is embraced,
and the fact of dying accepted by the individual, the doctors and the relatives,
what can be gained by ensuring that the process of dying is prolonged as
much as possible? Now, a dying person's wishes often count as nothing:
hence we want a change in the law. <BR>
<I><A HREF="#c">Back to Contents</A></I></FONT> 
<HR><A NAME="8"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>8. WHY ISN'T THE LAW CHANGED?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Often the medical profession claim there is no need for legislation.
In fact, Lord Dawson of Penn, the royal physician, argued that helping
patients to die was part of good doctoring. We now know he had practical
experience of this, in timing the end of George V. A Bill promoted in 1936,
seeking to permit voluntary euthanasia in certain circumstances and with
certain safeguards, was rejected, but public sympathy was with it. Subsequent
attempts to reform the law have met with similar fates, including in 1990
an Early Day Motion on the subject of voluntary euthanasia, and a 1993
Select Committee of the House of Lords. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>By mobilising public concern this could be changed. You
can help by supporting us; you could write to your MP, or open a debate
in your newspaper. <BR>
<I><A HREF="#c">Back to Contents</A></I></FONT> 
<HR><A NAME="9"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>9. BUT SURELY SUICIDE ISN'T ILLEGAL?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Suicide has long been legal in Scotland and, since 1961,
in the rest of Britain. However, aiding another person towards his or her
own suicide is still illegal, no matter how laudable the motives. It is
this situation which makes it impossible for doctors to practise active
euthanasia. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is the added difficulty that by the time many people
are driven to contemplate suicide because of their suffering, they are
not physically able to accomplish the act. The law is inconsistent inasmuch
as it tolerates suicide, but outlaws the means. To deny a person control
over his or her own life is immoral. It is an abuse of human rights, and
should be illegal. <BR>
<I><A HREF="#c">Back to Contents</A></I></FONT> 
<HR><A NAME="10"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>10. HOW CAN I HELP PROTECT MY RIGHTS?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>One way that we help members to establish their wishes is
to provide a form of advance directive known as a Living Will, which an
individual signs when in sound mind and body, to specify what they wish
to happen should various circumstances arise. It is signed in a common
sense, practical way, and not under emotional stress. The form can then
be lodged with your doctor as an indication of your wishes. It deals with
requests for the withholding of treatment where the situation warrants
it. It does not ask the doctor to do anything contrary to existing law,
but allows him or her to have access to the considered opinion of the patient.
Many doctors are welcoming the fact that patients and those closest to
them are willing to share the responsibility of what can be a very difficult
decision. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing
encourage the use of living wills and publish a Code of Practice to guide
their members. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>VESS also supplies a Living Will Alert Card, to be filled
in and carried in your purse or wallet, indicating you have signed a living
will. We suggest the use of a values history to help guide doctors should
difficult situations arise not adequately covered by your living will.The
values history helps you and your doctor to identify those things that,
for you, make life worth living. It can also further understanding with
those close to you, so they will know what is important to you should you
need their support. We publish regular updates in a Newsletter, providing
members not only with current academic arguments but with valuable practical
advice on their rights within the law. <BR>
<I><A HREF="#c">Back to Contents</A></I></FONT> 
<HR><A NAME="11"></A></P>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+1>11. I AM INTERESTED IN THE PRINCIPLES YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT
- WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?</FONT></H3>

<P><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>First of all, register your support on the <A HREF="http://www.netlink.co.uk/users/vess/new_app.html">application
form</A>. Your name will also help to swell the already substantial and
growing body of opinion worldwide in favour of our humane proposals. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What is required even more urgently is active support.
We need more members and more money to increase the momentum needed to
change the law. We also need more funds to operate a Support Network and
Information Service for members - assessing individual needs and providing
information about available options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>All correspondence to members is sent under plain cover
and membership is confidential. (Please note: legal considerations require
that people wishing to buy the booklet &quot;How to Die With Dignity&quot;
must be members of at least three months' standing. This is to discourage
irresponsible or unconsidered use of the contents. The price of the booklet
is not included in the subscription, and is issued at the discretion of
the Society). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The cost of membership is small, but it is an opportunity
to stand up for what you know to be right. Take a stand against suffering;
protect your own right to choose - and your right to be treated with dignity
and compassion in the event of severe, incurable illness. Finally, consider
making a donation, large or small, or making a bequest in your will; help
us function more effectively and use the coming challenge to ensure proper
measures and proper safeguards are enacted. Your money will be well spent.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Neither will you be alone in the battle. Prominent voices
have included the late philosopher Sir Alfred Ayer, father of biomedical
ethics Joseph Fletcher, journalist and broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy, columnist
Claire Rayner, playwright Brian Clark, actor and writer Sir Dirk Bogarde,
actress Katherine Hepburn, mountaineer Sir Edmund Hilary, the late scientist
and writer Isaac Asimov, and such well-known members of the medical profession
as Jonathan Miller, Wendy Savage and Christiaan Barnard.
