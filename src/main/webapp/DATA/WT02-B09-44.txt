<h2 ALIGN=center> Overcome the Challenges of Success </h2>



Busy people, especially executives, with a strong drive to achieve sometimes fall into what might be called the achiever's trap. Achievers' traps are attitudes and behaviors that limit potential success and destroy creative drive. <p>



<BR>



 Consider these possible traps and take positive action to avoid them:<p>







<ul>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap One: Doing too much – or not enough. Believe in others and give them the opportunity to accept responsibility for significant achievement. Accept that you can't do everything. However, giving too much of your own responsibilities to others who aren't adequately trained or who don't share your goals may impede your success. Maintain a written delegation plan that details what you plan to delegate and to whom, with checkpoints.


<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Two: Failure to recognize personal growth needs. Avoid assuming you've learned all you need to know. You still have more potential for achievement. Have a plan of action for personal growth and work toward challenging goals in all areas of your life.


<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Three: Accepting mediocrity. Pushing for excellence is hard work. Avoid making the mistake of accepting mediocre performance. The "average" isn't enough for one who aspires for real success. Demand outstanding results from yourself and from those associated with you. Keep constant checks on progress toward goals.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Four: Failure to use the best qualities of people. Study team members. Examine their strengths, goals and desires. Then, provide them with opportunities to learn new ideas that will make them more valuable as team members and more fulfilled as individuals.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Five: Ignoring problems or postponing solutions. The time to solve problems is before they occur. Carefully designed procedures prevent problems or provide for their proper handling if they occur. Hurdle obstacles quickly. Once a solution is found, implement it as quickly as possible.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Six: Incomplete communication. Make sure people clearly know what your goals are and how they can help you achieve them. Listen carefully to all information provided by others.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Trap Seven: Failure to train a successor. If you want to move up in an organization, the quickest way is to train someone to do your job. By doing so, you're available for new responsibilities. If you're in the top position, train someone to succeed you. If no one is ready to succeed you, the organization may fall when you're no longer there to lead it.<BR>


<BR>




</ul>

<h2 ALIGN=center> Working Effectively Internationally </h2>



 International business may create many obstacles but it also provides many promises. <p>



<BR>






 Most obstacles can be avoided if you prepare sufficiently ahead of time. Here are several suggestions:<p>


<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Speak slowly to your clients. Although most international business people speak English, many jargons and other items don't translate well. English may not be your client's first language so be aware of the differences.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Respect instead of rejecting customs you find different. Don't brag about how things are done in your country. Simply state that you've never experienced anything of that manner before. <BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Remember that nonverbal signs are different in other cultures. Eye contact and personal space change depending on who you're doing business with.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Let your clients lead you along. In America, it's proper to get down to business early. In some cultures, it's offensive not to know your business associates on a personal level first.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Adapt to the nuances of other cultures. You're the outsider and should change your habits to appease the locals. Get your hands on a guidebook ahead of time.<BR>


<BR>






</ul>






<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>



<BR>



<img src="graphics/la1196c.gif" align=right hspace=20>







<h2 ALIGN=center> Prepare Properly for Special Events </h2>

<BR>

 Check for problems you might encounter before your special event occurs with the following checklist:<p>







<ul>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Script what everyone will be doing during the event and ask each person to practice their role beforehand.


<BR>




<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Pick a good day to hold the event. If something else in your community will compete with you, schedule your event another day.


<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Establish a planning committee that will assist you in all the planning and coordinating the event entails. A group is much more likely to select the proper individuals for each assignment required to pull off the event.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Pre-plan what photos you want taken during the event. If there will be distinguished persons present, it's always nice to be photographed with them since such photos are impressive and can be used later by promoting purposes.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Form a scrapbook committee. Ask these employees to compile all the brochures, photos, stories and other material procured from the event in a book and keep the book on file to use as a reference for your next event.<BR>



<BR>



<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Evaluate the event immediately afterwards. Record on paper things you feel were done well and things you'd like to do better the next time you plan an event.<BR>


<BR>




</ul>



<center><IMG src="graphics/purpline.gif"></CENTER>



<BR>



<img src="graphics/la1196d.gif" align=left hspace=20>







<h2 ALIGN=center> Dare to Succeed as a Manager </h2>


Managing is much like being a member of a fraternity or other social group. Traditions and boundaries are rarely crossed and only by those who dare succeed as an individual. Do you have the self-confidence and courage to step out on your own? Or, are you satisfied with the status quo? <p>



<BR>





To break out of the mold other managers have set for you, act upon these ideas:<p>


<BR>





<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Never assume what works for others will work for you. You're a distinct person and have unique ideas that fit your personality and abilities. Believe in yourself and your ideas.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Attend to possible problems before you propose a change. Dealing with obstacles ahead of time helps you pull off your plan with few hitches. <BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Modify the ideas of others. Some ideas of others can be altered slightly to fit into your own personality style.<BR>







<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Gather ideas from others. Your employees may have great ideas if you listen to them. Keep an open mind and listen to every idea, no matter what the person's position is within the organization.<BR>


<BR>


<IMG src="graphics/ball_pink.gif"> Dare to stand out from the crowd. Let others know that you desire to be successful and are willing to take steps to make it happen.<BR>


<BR>

Avoid these statements: "That's been done before. It won't work," "That's not how things are done around here," "Don't take chances," "Anything that obvious can't be right," or "That's too different." Remain positive in all situations.<BR>
<BR>



</ul>
