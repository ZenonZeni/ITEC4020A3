<strong>IDEA listed in Unfunded Mandate Document</strong><P>

The U.S. Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) Commission
voted against accepting their own final report, by a vote of 7-13.  CEC -- along with a
number of disability, education, and citizen's rights groups -- had opposed the report,
which was charged with making recommendations on changing laws that are unfunded
federal mandates.  Although the report was voted down and probably will never be
distributed, it is important for us to consider what was said about IDEA.  These
comments may resurface later.<P>

The recently released ACIR draft report included recommended changes to IDEA, in
spite of the fact that IDEA is neither unfunded nor a mandate.  Participation in IDEA is
voluntary and is not based upon Congressional fiat, but on Constitutional grounds. 
Although the draft final report of the ACIR pointed out that IDEA is voluntary, it
nevertheless included IDEA in the draft report.  For a copy of the complete
ACIR draft language relating to IDEA, please contact <a
href="mailto:jackib@cec.sped.org"> Jacki Bootel </a> at CEC.<P>

While CEC recommended many of the changes that were included in the draft report
(full funding at 40% of excess costs, cutting back on unnecessary paperwork,
increasing use of alternative dispute resolution), we were very concerned about efforts
to limit the private right of action, any infringement on due process protections, and the
inclusion of IDEA in an unfunded mandate document.<P>

<strong>Federal Circuit Court Upholds FAPE After Expulsion</strong><P>

The Department of Education has long held that schools cannot deny educational
services to students who are expelled for reasons unrelated to their disabilities.  This
opinion was upheld by the 4th Federal Circuit Court in <em>Virginia Dept of Ed v
Riley</em>.   The Commonwealth of Virginia challenged the Department policy when it
refused to provide services to students who had been expelled or suspended.  When
the U.S. Department of Education called for a hearing in order to withhold funds from
Virginia, the case came to national attention.  IDEA clearly states that all children with
disabilities have a right to FAPE.  CEC has always supported the continuation of FAPE
and is pleased with the court's decision. <P>

<strong>America Goes Back to School</strong><P>

The Department of Education, along with CEC and hundreds of other organizations,
schools, businesses, community groups, etc., have joined in the "Partnership for Family
Involvement in Education."  Among its other efforts, the Partnership members will be
holding back-to-school activities all over the country early this fall.  It's very important
that educators, parents, and advocates of exceptional children are involved in these
events.  If you are planning back-to-school events in your community, the Department
of Education would like to know about them.  For a copy of the "America Goes Back to
School" form, please contact <a href="mailto:agbts@ed.gov">Jennifer Ballen </a> at
the U.S. Department of Education.<P>

<strong>Talking Points for Local Meetings & Campaign Events</strong><P>

<ul><LI>Changes in welfare and federal education funding will result in local schools
receiving less support from Washington than in years past.  Do state/local
officials/candidates intend to let local children absorb the losses by passing on these
cuts, or how do they intend to make up the difference?<P>

<li>Inclusion has led to increasing numbers of children with disabilities being served in
regular classrooms.  How do school board members and/or administrators intend to assure
that regular education teachers have the training and support they need to effectively
serve all children?<P>

<li>Technology has opened up a world of information to students who have access to it. 
Are your local schools wired?  If not now, when?  How do leaders plan to provide basic
technological education to those who need it while assisting those who are already
proficient in refining and expanding their skills and knowledge?<P>

<li>Discipline has become a very important topic in education.  What alternative
programs do local leaders/school officials have in place (or intend to develop) so that
children who are currently dangerous to themselves or others can get the quality
education they need in an alternative setting until their skills and behaviors are
appropriate for a regular classroom setting? </ul><p>

<strong>Rehabilitation Act Reauthorization Meetings</strong><P>

The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a major civil rights law that has many implications for
children with disabilities.  Section 504 of the Act protects the rights of  "any person who
(I) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such
person's major life activities, (ii) has a record of such an impairment, or (iii) is regarded
as having such an impairment."<P>

The Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) will be holding
public meetings to solicit comments on possible improvements in the law.  The
meetings will be in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 17; in Chicago, Illinois, on
September 19, and in Bellevue, Washington, on October 29.   Written comments are
also being accepted.  For further information about the meetings or on sending written
comments, call us at CEC's Department of Public Policy or contact Beverlee Stafford at
the U.S. Department of Education at (202) 205-8831.<P>

<strong>Javits Receiving Increasing Attention from Administration</strong><P>

Although the Javits Gifted and Talented program is a very small commitment, in federal
terms, it is getting more attention in the FY97 budget rhetoric than it received in FY 96. 
The Department of Education, in its chart comparing appropriations and the President's
1997 requests, includes Javits in spite of its small size.  The Department's July
Community Update listed only six "major" education programs on its comparison chart,
including Javits.  Perhaps this increased interest on the part of the administration,
coupled with advocacy from groups such as CEC, will result in this program regaining
some of the more than 60% of its funding that was cut from the initial appropriation in
1995 through 1996.  Congress needs more education about how much this very small
program has improved the education of the nation's more than 5 million gifted and
talented children.<P>
