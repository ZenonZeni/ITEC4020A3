<B>Welcome to the Land of the Midnight Sun</B>
</CENTER>
<P>

This <A HREF="http://www.ugastro.berkeley.edu/SOFA/">SOFA</A> member for
some unknown reason left the warm confines of California and headed off to
<IMG ALIGN=left SRC="sun.gif" ALT="[Mystical Sun]"> Fairbanks, Alaska -
the Land of the Midnight Sun. (Planning to come here? Check out the <A
HREF="http://www.alaska-online.com/travel/">Alaska Internet Travel Guide
</A>.) Graduating from Berkeley in May 1993 and working for Space Sciences
Lab for the next two years, he decided to do something different. Just
remember folks, he's crazy. 
<P>
At present I am working in the Geophysical Institue for the <A
HREF="http://sparc1k.images.alaska.edu/">Alaska SAR Facility/STEP</A>
program. What do all these fancy initials and technical talk mean? Click
on the link and find out for yourself because I am tired of explaining it
all. 
<P>
My current duties include maintaining the <A
HREF="../../software.html">ASF/STEP tools</A> and creating new ones as
the need arises. I am also in the process of creating an educational tool
that incorporates SAR data. In addition, I maintain the WWW pages for part
of the ASF Science division. If you have questions about the tools or WWW
pages, please don't hesitate to email <A
HREF="mailto:mshindle@sparc1k.images.alaska.edu">me</A>. 
<P>
Fairbanks weather is constantly changing. So, mom is constantly calling and
wondering what the temperature is and what the weather outside is like. So,
this <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Weather/cgi-bin/tech_weather.pl?FAI">
link</A> is for her. This will let her and anyone else know the current
weather conditions of where I live.
<P>
At present I am experimenting with some 3D modeling of SAR, AVHRR, and USGS
data. I hope to incorporate this with interferometric results from SAR data
to create a more realistic model with more information. If you would like to
see some of the results, check out <a
href="http://www.images.alaska.edu/threed/ak.html">Three Dimensional
Alaska</a>, a virtual plane-ride through some interesting sites in Alaska.
<P>
