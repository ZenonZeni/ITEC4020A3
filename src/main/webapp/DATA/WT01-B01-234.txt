<H1>SEA FAQ's: </H1>

<H2>Do I Get Academic Credit?</H2>

<P>
<B>Yes! </B><CITE>SEA Semester is designed to be a regular part
of your undergraduate education. After successfully completing
the program, you receive the equivalent of a full semester's academic
credit. Students from our affiliated institutions receive credit
directly from their own college. Students from non-affiliated
institutions are enrolled by SEA at Boston University and their
credits are earned through that institution. </CITE>
<P>
<CITE>Academic credits through Boston University can be transferred
to your own college or university by working with your academic
advisor at your college and with SEA's Admission Office. Credits
may be applied to your major and/or to your general requirements
for graduation. More than 150 colleges and universities regularly
accept all or some of these credits. Upon request, SEA will gladly
provide program syllabi to the appropriate academic officers at
your school.</CITE> 
<H2>What about Financial Aid?</H2>

<P>
<CITE>Financial assistance is available for SEA Semester. SEA's
own grants and interest-free loans are awarded based on need.
Several special, non-need-based scholarships are also awarded
each year.</CITE> 
<P>
<CITE>Determination of need-based financial aid is made after
acceptance; applying for assistance will in no way affect your
chances for admission. We urge you to apply for aid if your personal,
family and institutional resources cannot meet the full cost of
an SEA program. </CITE>
<P>
<CITE>Federal aid programs are applicable to SEA. Some colleges
allow students to transfer aid packages directly to SEA.</CITE>

<P>
<CITE>Our financial aid office will gladly discuss the resources
available to you, and will work closely with you to try to find
ways to make SEA Semester a reality for you. We are in frequent
touch with the financial aid offices at many colleges and universities.
If you are planning to apply to SEA Semester, you should talk
first to a financial aid officer at your home institution and
find out what assistance your school can provide. Inform your
officer that you may be off campus so that federal aid will be
transferred properly.</CITE> 
<P>
<CITE>If you have any questions about financial aid, call SEA's
Office of Financial Assistance, toll-free: 1-800-552-3633</CITE>

<H2>Do I Need Sailing Experience?</H2>

<P>
<B>No.</B> <I>Students come to SEA with a broad range of sailing
experiences. Some students have been sailing since they were toddlers.
Others have never set foot on a boat before sailing on the </I>Westward<I>
or the </I>Cramer<I>. Still others have never seen the ocean. SEA Semester's
Shore Component course in Nautical Science provides you with an
understanding of the principles of sailing and navigation. Instruction
continues through the entire Sea Component, when you put into
practice the theories you learned ashore. At sea you have an unrivaled
opportunity to gain hands-on experience sailing a tall ship.</I>

<H2>Do I Need to be a Science Major?</H2>

<P>
<B>No.</B> <CITE>SEA students represent a wide variety
of majors and previous academic experiences. Students majoring
in English, religion and art history join those in biology, geology
and engineering to complement each other's strengths and expertise.
Eleven of the seventeen SEA course credits are in the sciences,
but eight of these credits are earned during the Sea Component,
where coursework is active, practical and engaging in ways very
different from traditional science courses on college campuses.</CITE>

<P>
<CITE>In SEA Semester, with the assistance and direction of the
Chief Scientist, you and each of your classmates design original
research projects in some aspect of oceanography that you will
carry out at sea. Your individual research can reflect your level
of science background; for example, the more science you have
had, the more sophisticated your project can be. No matter the
topic, a great deal of faculty guidance and peer support are available
to you throughout the research process.</CITE> 
<P>
<CITE>While you work independently on your research, the interdisciplinary
nature of ocean sciences requires cooperation and the exchange
of data and ideas with your classmates and the scientific staff.
As you gain insight into the scientific process, your project
adds to the body of oceanographic data, long-term SEA studies
and research conducted by associated researchers. Most important,
your project enhances your understanding of the waters in which
you sail.</CITE>
