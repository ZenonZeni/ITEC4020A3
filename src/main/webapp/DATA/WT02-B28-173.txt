<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Taking Care of Business with Split-Dollar Life
Insurance</STRONG></FONT><P>

	Split dollar is not a special life insurance policy; rather, it is a special
way
to purchase
permanent
insurance.  It is used widely to solve business buyout and executive benefit
problems.  For
split dollar to
work, two parties are required who "split" premiums and benefits.  In the IRS
definition, split
dollar "is
an arrangement whereby the party with the need and the party with the ability to
pay
premiums join in
purchasing an insurance contract in which there is a substantial investment
element." (Rev.
Rule.
64-328)
<P>
<STRONG>How Split-Dollar Insurance Works</STRONG><BR>
	In one typical arrangement, a corporation will purchase an insurance policy on
the life
of an owner
or
key employee, and will pay 100 percent of the premiums.  The insured can own the
policy
and name a
personal beneficiary.  The cash value and a portion of the death benefit will be
owned as
"collateral" by
the corporation to the extent of the premiums paid.  The terms of the corporation's
interest
are spelled
out in a "collateral assignment form" and a separate legal agreement.  If the
insured dies
while the
collateral assignment is in effect, the corporation recovers premiums paid from the
death
benefit.  The
remainder goes to the insured's personal beneficiary.  If the insured lives for a
number of
years, the
insurance cash value may be sufficient to repay the corporation for its entire
outlay.  The
policy may then
be "rolled out" to the insured, who can continue the plan as a personal insurance
policy.<P>
	For tax treatment, the corporation cannot deduct its premiums, nor is the
employee
taxed on those
premiums.  Rather, the employee is taxed on what the IRS calls "the economic
benefit,"
which is the
cost of insurance benefit as defined by the IRS.<P>
	A "tax wise" variation of split dollar works as outlined above, with one
additional
wrinkle.  Here the
insured pays a portion of the premium out of his or her own pocket; the corporation
pays the
balance.  In
this variation, called "contributory split dollar," the insured is not taxed on
that part of the
economic
benefit paid with personal funds.  The employee's  share of the premium can equal
or
exceed the
economic benefit.
<P>
<STRONG>Uses of Split-Dollar Insurance</STRONG><BR>
	Business buyout: Al and Luiz are co-owners of Computer Works, Inc.  Both
see
the
virtue of a
buy-and-sell agreement and the logic of funding that permanent need with permanent
life
insurance. 
Neither Al nor Luiz, however, wants to pay permanent insurance premiums from his
own
pocket.  Here
is what they do.  Al and Luiz apply for insurance, each on the life of the other,
in an amount
sufficient to
fund the buy-and-sell agreement, and they name themselves beneficiary.  The bulk of
the
premiums are
paid by the corporation on a split dollar basis.  Al and Luiz contribute only an
amount equal
to the
economic benefit, roughly the same amount that they would have spent on a standard
term
policy. 
Eventually, Computer Works, Inc. will recover its premiums from either the cash
value or the
death
benefit in accordance with the split-dollar agreement and collateral assignment
form. Split
dollar
enables Al and Luiz to achieve an important business continuation objective in a
way that is
fair and
effective.  
<P>
	Executive Benefits:  Goodman, Inc. is wholly owned by an architect, Ellen
Goodman.  In
addition to
several other employees, Ellen employs a skilled thirty-five year old designer,
Karl Schmidt. 
Ellen
would like to retain Karl's services, but is not eager to install a benefits
program for all
employees. 
After considering a number of alternatives, Ellen, on the advice of her CPA,
chooses a
split-dollar plan
for Karl.  Split dollar provides Karl with a significant death benefit.  Equally
attractive are the
cash
values. 
Even after repaying Goodman, Inc. for its premium contribution, the policy may
build
significant
cash values by the time Karl is sixty-five.  The plan is just too good for
Karl to walk
away.  For
Goodman, Inc., split dollar is a cost-effective way to retain a valued employee.
	<P>
	Split dollar can also be an estate planning tool.  Properly structured, the
policy
proceeds from the
plan
can be kept out of the insured's estate.  Those contemplating a split-dollar plan
should
contact their
New York Life agent, as well as their own legal and financial advisors.<P>
	Split dollar is not something for nothing, but for the insured it can be a
great
deal for
very little.
