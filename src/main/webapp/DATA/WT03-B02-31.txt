Encephalitis
Microsphere Formulation Improves Encephalitis Vaccine


Mouse studies show that it may be possible to make a safe vaccine against a
deadly form of viral encephalitis.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus - an alphavirus of the family
Togaviridae - is spread by mosquitoes and can cause fatal human infections
during epizootics among horses.

The most effective vaccine against VEE virus is the live attenuated Trinidad
donkey strain TC-83.  But not only do 20 percent of vaccinated humans and
animals fail to develop neutralizing antibody titers to TC-83, evidence
suggests that the vaccine may cause birth defects and diabetes.  Moreover,
there is concern that the vaccine strain could revert to its virulent form.

The alternative to TC-83 is the formalin-killed whole virus vaccine C-84.
While this vaccine is safe, it is far less effective than the live attenuated
vaccine and requires multiple injections for induction of immunity.

Now researcher Terrence E.  Greenway of the University of Alabama, Birmingham,
and colleagues have developed a microsphere delivery system for killed VEE
virus that is apparently both safe and immunogenic.  They reported their
results in the journal Vaccine ("Enhancement of Protective Immune Responses to
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) Virus with Microencapsulated Vaccine,"
Vaccine, 1995;13(15):1411-20).

"The microencapsulated VEE virus vaccine induced systemic immune responses
which were higher and persisted longer than those induced with the free virus
vaccine," Greenway et al.  wrote.  "The microencapsulated virus was more
effective than the free virus in inducing immune responses protective against
systemic challenge with virulent VEE virus."

Biodegradable polymer microspheres were developed over the last decade as a
means of releasing contraceptive steroids.  Vaccinologists were quick to see
the potential benefits of this technology.

"Microsphere technology has the potential benefits of reducing the number of
inoculations, enhancing the immune response via both parenteral and oral
vaccination routes, and in reducing the total antigen dose required to achieve
immune protection," wrote researcher M.C.  Steinhoff of the Center for
Immunization Research, Baltimore, Maryland, in a recent review (Vaccine,
January 1994;12(1):5-11).

Greenway and colleagues noted that a number of different research teams have
shown poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide) or DL-PLG microspheres to be effective
vehicles for augmenting immune responses to antigen administered either
mucosally or systemically.

Various types of DL-PLG-based vaccines have already been proven safe in
humans.

Greenway et al.  created several versions of DL-PLG microencapsulated VEE
virus and compared their immunogenicity and protective efficacy to that of
free virus vaccine in BALB/c mice.

Subcutaneous immunization with 50 (micro)g microencapsulated VEE virus yielded
anti-VEE antibody titers up to 32 times higher than that seen with free virus.

When the mice that had received the microencapsulated vaccine received a
second booster immunization, their antibody responses remained stable
throughout the 100-day observation period.  Antibody levels began to wane only
in mice boosted with free virus.

"At high vaccine doses (i.e.  25 or 50 (micro)g), microspheres prepared with
either methylene chloride or ethyl acetate were equally effective in inducing
specific anti-VEE virus antibody response after both the primary and secondary
immunization," Greenway et al.  observed.  "However, when a lower dose (12.5
(micro)g) of the vaccines was tested, methylene chloride processed
microspheres induced higher antibody responses after both the primary and
secondary immunization.  ...  The solvent ethyl acetate reduced the
immunogenicity of formalin-fixed, inactivated VEE virus during the
microencapsulation procedure."

In addition, the researchers found that formalin-fixed VEE was far better than
non-formalin-fixed VEE for use in the microspheres.

"Formalin fixation of the whole inactivated VEE virus vaccine prior to
microencapsulation with the solvent methylene chloride dramatically enhanced
the immunogenicity of the final product, presumably through enhanced
conformational stability," they wrote.

In the mouse experiments, 80 percent of mice immunized with a single dose of 5
(micro)g VEE virus in microspheres prepared with methylene chloride survived
challenge with virulent VEE virus.  Only 20 percent of mice that received the
free virus vaccine survived challenge.

"At a high vaccine dose (i.e., 50 (micro)g), the microencapsulated vaccines
afforded 100 percent protection, whereas a similar dose of free antigen
resulted in 40 percent survival in one experiment and 100 percent survival in
a second experiment," Greenway et al.  wrote.

"These results, taken together with the protection results after secondary
immunization with either free or microencapsulated virus vaccine, indicate
that a single immunization with the microsphere vaccine could afford
protection similar to that attained with multiple immunizations with the free
virus vaccine."

The researchers are currently exploring the effectiveness of microencapsulated
VEE virus administered by various routes in protecting against aerosol
challenge with virulent VEE virus.

The corresponding author for this study is Suzanne M.  Michalek, Department of
Microbiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama 35294.

Emerging Diseases
Could Rabies-Like Diseases Enter the U.S.?


Rabies-like diseases could cause epidemics in the U.S.  if infected animals
are imported from endemic areas, U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) researchers warn.

Although each year rabies kills 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide, only one
or two deaths occur in the U.S.  due to widespread vaccination of domestic
animals, effective (but costly) post-exposure treatment (PET), and recent
programs to vaccinate wild animals.

This reduction in mortality is expensive:  the U.S.  rabies prevention program
costs an estimated $230 million to $1 billion in public and private expenses
per year, reported Charles E.  Rupprecht and colleagues of the CDC in a recent
publication ("The Ascension of Wildlife Rabies:  A Cause for Public Health
Concern or Intervention?"  Emerging Infectious Diseases, 1995;1(4):107ff).

But little-understood cousins of the rabies virus that exist outside the U.S.
are at best only marginally susceptible to rabies vaccine.  Either accidental
or intentional importation of infected animals to non-endemic areas raise the
animal reservoir - for most if not all of these viruses are from various
species of bats.

"Infections with non-rabies lyssaviruses have resulted in rabies vaccine
failures," Rupprecht et al.  noted.  "Such infections raise the specter of
potentially serious public health consequences if introduced and subsequently
established in susceptible bat populations."

Members of the Lyssavirus genus are a group of genetically related
negative-stranded RNA viruses.  The viruses that cause rabies are the
rhabdoviridae, found everywhere except for Australia, Antarctica, and some
isolated islands.  Other Lyssaviruses include:

* Mokola virus.  The reservoir for this virus is unknown, but Rupprecht et al.
suggest that it may be some type of insectivore or rodent as it was first
isolated in a species of shrew trapped in 1968 in the Mokola Forest outside
Ibadan, Nigeria; bushveld gerbils in Zimbabwe were found to be seropositive.
Cases have occurred in Nigeria, South Africa, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Central
African Republic, and Ethiopia.  There have been two documented human
infections.  Rabies vaccine does not protect against this virus.

* Lagosbat virus.  The reservoir for this virus is thought to be fruit bats.
Only 10 cases have been identified thus far, three in domestic animals, in
Nigeria, South Africa, Zimbabwe, the Central African Republic, Senegal, and
Ethiopia.  No human deaths are documented.  Rabies virus offers only marginal
protection.

* Duvenhage virus.  The reservoir for this virus is not known, but is
suspected to be insect-eating bats.  Cases have occurred in South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and Senegal.  The virus is named after a man from Pretoria, South
Africa who in 1970 developed rabies-like encephalitis after being bitten by a
bat.  The patient died.  No cases in domestic animals have been identified.
Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV1).  The reservoir for this virus is a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Eptesicus serotinus.  One human case
was documented in 1985, another was suspected in 1977.  Although the virus has
been found in more than 400 bats, no cases in domestic animals have been
identified.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

* European bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV2).  The reservoirs for this virus is again a
European insectivorous bat, most likely Mytotis dasycneme.  The virus was
first identified in a Swiss bat biologist working in Finland who died of a
rabies-like illness.  Of the five known cases, none have occurred in domestic
animals.  Rabies vaccine offers only marginal protection.

"The distances between Africa, Eurasia, Pacific Oceania, and the New World
mitigate against the dispersal, migration, and introduction of healthy bats
without human intervention," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "However, several
recent events illustrate the opportunity for the transoceanic transfer of
rabies-infected bats."

These events include:

* Research institutions.  There have been two close calls in research
facilities.  Canadian researchers in 1986 shipped a live big brown bat
(Eptesicus fuscus) to German associates.  The bat became ill was diagnosed
with rabies.  In 1994, a Massachusetts research team collected 12 wild big
brown bats and sent them to Danish researchers.  Six of the bats died of
rabies.

* Commercial enterprises.  A big brown bat was captured in Hawaii on a
container ship carrying automobiles from Michigan.  The bat was rabid.

* Legal or illegal importation of animals.  Improperly issued federal permits
in 1994 permitted import to the U.S.  of thousands of bats, mostly Egyptian
tomb bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus).  Normally, sales of imported bats or their
offspring are prohibited by federal law except by research institutions or
zoos where contact with the public is limited.  Such bats are normally
subjected to extended quarantine.  The CDC warns people who own imported bats
to prevent contact with humans.

"Although no reports of lyssaviruses isolated from Egyptian fruit bats exist,
active surveillance for such viruses has not been conducted," Rupprecht et al.
warned.  "These bats are relatively common and widespread throughout the area
that extends from Turkey and Cyprus to Pakistan, the Arabian peninsula, Egypt,
and most of sub-Saharan Africa.  Because they may roost by the thousands in a
wide variety of habitats, there is ample opportunity for interaction with
other Chiroptera, such as the widely distributed straw-colored (Eidolon
helvum) or epauletted (Epomophorus wahlbergi) fruit bats; both of these
species have been implicated in Lyssavirus epizootiology in Africa.

"The adaptability of Egyptian fruit bats should be a cause for concern because
of the potential for survival and interaction among indigenous bat fauna,
particularly in the southern United States."

Such a disaster would not be the first importation of a lyssavirus to the
United States.  While folklore recounts tales of bat-spread disease prior to
European colonization of the New World, the importation of dogs and red foxes
for the sport of fox hunting led to widespread epizootics.

When rabies became a nationally reported disease in 1938, limited surveillance
revealed 9,412 cases per year - mostly in domestic animals - with 47 human
deaths.  Rabies control efforts for pet dogs began in the 1920s and by 1960
rabies occurred more often in wild than in domestic animals.

From 1961 to 1989, skunks were the primary U.S.  reservoir for rabies but they
were then supplanted by raccoons, probably boosted by transport of infected
animals from southern states.

Along with this change in animal vectors, the human epidemiology of rabies has
changed.  Until 1965, most up to 80 percent of human cases occurred after a
known exposure, usually a dog bite.  But in the last 10 years - with the 1975
advent of a more effective canine vaccine - rabies deaths occurred in people
who had no history of an animal bite.

"Almost all the recent human cases occurred after an animal exposure that was
unrecognized by the patient as carrying a risk for rabies infection,"
Rupprecht et al.  wrote.  "The apparent source of human rabies has also
changed:  14 of the 18 cases acquired in the United States since 1980 involved
rabies variants associated with insectivorous bats."

As noted above, the cost of rabies protection is high.  Rupprecht et al.
noted that the New York State rabies diagnostic laboratory received 3,000
submissions in 1989, but received 12,000 submissions in 1993 after the
epizootic of raccoon rabies reached the state.

"The cost per human life saved from rabies ranges from approximately $10,000
to $100 million, depending on the nature of the exposure and the probability
of rabies in a region," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.

"What's more, most economic analyses do not take into account the
psychological trauma caused by human exposure to rabies, the subsequent
euthanasia of pets, or the loss of wildlife resources during rabies outbreaks.
Rabies in wildlife has now reached historically high levels in the United
States, and the costs of preventing human rabies are mounting."

Rupprecht, chief of the CDC Rabies Section, and colleagues argue strongly
against population reduction of animal vectors for rabies on ecological,
economic, and ethical grounds.  They instead promote oral vaccination programs
for wildlife, a concept first proposed in the 1960s by the CDC.

"Oral rabies vaccination of the red fox with vaccine-laden baits is an
integral aspect of rabies control throughout southeastern Canada and Europe,
where more than 75 million doses of vaccine have been distributed over 5
million km(2) during the past two decades," they wrote.  "Consequently, rabies
incidence among wild and domestic animals has fallen, as have PETS for human
rabies."

However, the shift of the epizootic from foxes to raccoons required an
extensive laboratory and field research effort, as the vaccines effective for
foxes were ineffective for raccoons and coyotes.

"In 1983, a vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine was
developed that has proven to be an effective oral immunogen in raccoons and
various other important reservoir species; vaccine advantages include improved
thermostability and an inability to cause rabies," Rupprecht et al.  wrote.
"When vaccine-laden baits are offered under natural conditions, contact with
them by nontarget wildlife species cannot be totally excluded.  However,
studies of V-RG virus have shown no vaccine-associated morbidity, mortality,
or gross pathologic lesions in more than 40 warm-blooded vertebrate species
examined."

An efficacy field trial of the V-RG vaccine took place in Cape May, New
Jersey, between spring 1992 and autumn 1994.  Nearly 100,000 fishmeal baits
laced with vaccine were distributed over 56,000 hectares both by hand and by
helicopter.  Overall rabies incidence and rate of spread was significantly
reduced.

Although oral wildlife vaccination programs are currently in Massachusetts,
New York, Florida, and southern Texas, Rupprecht et al.  noted that there are
many questions yet to be answered:

* What is the optimal ratio of animal population density to bait density?

* What level of herd immunity will be required to eliminate rabies?

* What is the best way to distribute the vaccine bait?

* How can the methods successful for foxes and raccoons be adapted to rabies
control in species such as skunks, mongooses, and dogs?

* Who will fund these programs over time?

* What do rabies control and prevention efforts really cost?

"Given the problems inherent in wildlife control, the greater issue of
extending these methods to the control of dog rabies in the developing world
will be a challenge well into the next century," Rupprecht et al.  concluded.

Cancer Vaccines (Pancreatic Carcinoma)
Vaccination with Mutant Ras Peptides Induces T-Cell Response


Pancreatic carcinoma patients carrying a ras mutation exhibited T-cell
responsiveness after vaccination with the corresponding mutant RAS peptides.

Because CD4 and CD8 T cells specific for a single ras mutation have been
described, and because mutant p21 RAS can be recognized by human T cells,
mutant p21 RAS represents an exclusive tumor-specific antigen.  These findings
suggest that RAS peptide vaccination of cancer patients with a verified ras
mutation might be used as a specific immunotherapy.

Marianne K.  Gjertsen et al.  vaccinated pancreatic cancer patients exhibiting
a ras mutation with a synthetic RAS peptide in an effort to influence the
clinical course of the disease ("Vaccination with Mutant RAS Peptides and
Induction of T-Cell Responsiveness in Pancreatic Carcinoma Patients Carrying
the Corresponding ras Mutation," The Lancet, November 25,
1995;346(8987):1399-1400).

"Results indicate that specific T-cell responses against mutations uniquely
harbored in tumor cells can be induced in cancer patients by vaccination,"
stated Gjertsen et al.

Five patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
with ras mutations were enrolled in this clinical trial.  Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (1-4x10(9)) were collected by leukapheresis and loaded with
a synthetic RAS peptide encompassing residues 5-21 of p21 RAS and
corresponding to the mutation in the patients tumor tissue.

Patients were vaccinated on day 0 and boosted on days 14 and 35.  Additional
boosters were given every 4-6 weeks.  None of the patients exhibited any toxic
reactions or side-effects after vaccination.

None of the patients exhibited T-cell responsiveness to any of the RAS
peptides tested before the protocol started, although they showed normal
T-cell responses against other test antigens.  Two of the five patients
exhibited T-cell response to RAS peptides in their peripheral blood
mononuclear cells around day 40 after the onset of the vaccination protocol,
noted the authors.

The T-cell response was transient, and disappeared during the following weeks.
Repeated vaccinations did not result in a reappearance of detectable
responding T cells in the peripheral blood.

Although puzzled at first by the lack of detectable T-cell response, the
authors determined that the tumor-specific T cells elicited by RAS peptide
vaccination were homing to the tumor and being selectively removed from
circulation.

No major therapeutic response was observed in the any of the patients,
including the two who exhibited brief T-cell responses.  The authors felt that
this was due to the terminal stage of the disease in the patients.  All the
patients had large tumor burdens and progressively deteriorating immune
systems, with life expectancies of only three to four months.

Tumor tissue taken from the two responding patients after they died showed
that lymphocyte infiltration was prominent and was mainly constituted by T
cells.  This finding was compatible with the explanation that the RAS-specific
T cells elicited by the vaccination may have homed in to the tumors of these
patients, noted the authors.

They also noted that vaccination by a single tumor-specific epitope may not be
sufficient in these circumstances as the therapeutic vaccine may have been too
little, too late.  Ongoing studies in patients with minimal residual disease
could provide a clinical setting allowing for more careful evaluation of
immune responses and the potential for clinical benefits of RAS peptide
vaccine, noted the authors.

"Our method for vaccination is novel," concluded Gjertsen et al.  "We injected
large amounts of peptide-pulsed mononuclear cells.  The rational is that a
fraction of these cells (i.e., pulsed dendritic cells and monocytes) will end
up in lymphoid organs, where the actual T-cell stimulation will take place.
Two and three rounds of vaccination seemed to be sufficient to break the state
of unresponsiveness to the mutant RAS peptides in [the two] patients [who
responded]."

This study was an extension of preliminary research done by these same authors
which was presented at the International Symposium on Cancer Vaccines, held
October 3-5, 1994.  At that time, they stated "Our results indicate that
immunotherapy targeted against neoplastic cells carrying ras mutations is
possible, and a protocol based on loading professional antigen presenting
cells with synthetic RAS peptides is currently being tested in a clinical
setting."

This research was supported by the Norwegian Cancer Society, the Norwegian
Research Council for Science and the Humanities, and Pronova, Norway.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
"New" ACTG Moves Forward


Can the main clinical trials group in the U.S.  shed its image as a dinosaur
too large and slow-moving to respond to new developments in AIDS therapies?

According to the chair of the group's Adult Executive Committee - University
of Colorado researcher Robert "Chip" Schooley - recent reorganization has
accomplished this objective.  Schooley made his remarks during the Twentieth
AIDS Clinical Trials Group Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington,
D.C.

The AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) is the arm of the U.S.  National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Division of AIDS (DAIDS)
responsible for testing new treatments for HIV disease and its complications.

But the group - particularly the division responsible for testing drugs in
adults - has been severely criticized for lacking central control and for
moving far too slowly to provide answers to pressing questions about AIDS
therapies.

DAIDS recently completed a top-to-bottom evaluation and reorganization of the
ACTG.  In a plenary address to the group's first general meeting since the
changes took effect, Schooley acknowledged that many of the criticisms were
valid, but also stressed the group's many achievements.

"We've been through a lot of self and external evaluation," Schooley said.
"But there are a lot of things right with this organization.  This is the
preeminent clinical organization in the world.  We have put together a
tremendous organization to deal with a disease we all are tired of."

Schooley noted that four years ago only one drug had been approved for the
treatment of primary HIV infection and that today, largely due to ACTG
efforts, there are five such drugs with a sixth on the way.

"This organization will play a major role in understanding how these drugs
work," he said.  "We have a tremendous opportunity to move along quickly."

Schooley noted that recent ACTG studies have defined a role for combination
therapy with the nucleoside analog didanosine (ddI) and for the use of the new
protease inhibitor saquinavir.

He promised that the ACTG would make increased use of new laboratory findings
"to tell us what we need to do."

The "new" ACTG will collaborate more closely with DAIDS, Schooley said.  But
most importantly, the ACTG will streamline and simplify the process by which
it generates clinical trial protocols.

"One of the things we were appropriately criticized for was behaving like
civil servants," Schooley said, referring to previous bureaucratic processes
that prevented the rapid testing of new treatments in a clinical setting.

The organization of the ACTG has been streamlined so that the adult section
has only three committees making research decisions.  These three Research
Agenda Committees (RACs) are the HIV Disease RAC, the Immunology RAC, and the
Opportunistic Disease RAC.  Committees that were once separate RACs - the
Pharmacology Committee, the Women's Health Committee, and the Patient Care
Committee - will now be established as standing resource committees within
each of the three main RACs.

There will be two major changes in how the ACTG functions:  there will be
centralized control of both resources and laboratories.

Resources will now be controlled directly by those planning and executing the
ACTG scientific agenda via a Scientific Agenda Steering Committee comprised of
the various committee chairs.

Laboratories previously operated independently of the research committees,
receiving their funds directly from DAIDS.

"Now scientific committees will directly control the labs," Schooley said.  "I
think this will work very well."

But the executive committee chair warned that the ACTG would continue to
change.

"Four years from now this will be a very different organization than now," he
said.  "The changes have been good, they have been enabling."

He called for the active participation of each investigator.

"Two thousand people thinking will get more done than just a few executive
committee members," Schooley said.

Conference Coverage (ACTG)
Patient Recruitment and Retention a Problem for ACTG


Many institutions conducting AIDS clinical trials have been unable to find and
keep study participants.

A study of 28 institutions participating in U.S.  government-sponsored
clinical trials showed that 18 of the sites (64 percent) failed to meet their
patient accrual goals.

The study, conducted by Washington University researcher Michael Klebert and
colleagues, was presented at the Twentieth AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG)
Meeting, held December 2-6, 1995, in Washington, D.C.  The ACTG Patient Care
Committee, a resource committee of the ACTG executive committee, performed the
study.

"Adequate recruitment and retention are essential in conducting successful
clinical trials," Klebert said.

Of 35 participating ACTG sites queried anonymously, 28 participated in the
study.  Except that they tended to be located on the east coast,
nonparticipating sites were not significantly different in terms of size or
patient demographics from participating institutions.

Surprisingly, the study found that the number of recruitment strategies used
by a study site was not related to meeting recruitment and retention goals.

Strategies positively correlated with successful patient recruitment and
retention were provision of child care, education of patients, provision of
peer advocates for patients, and payment via cash or vouchers.  Provision of
support groups was negatively correlated with success.

More than half of the sites identified study design as a barrier to
recruitment.  Nearly 40 percent of the sites said that barriers to successful
recruitment were lack of outreach and cultural sensitivity.

The sites with the worst recruitment/retention problems tended not to combine
primary care with study-protocol visits.  But high proportions of minority
patients or high proportions of patients using intravenous drugs was not
associated with poor recruitment or retention.

The major barriers to patient retention were the use of unpopular or too many
drugs in the study, high frequency of visits, and the availability of
alternative drugs.

Based on the study findings, Klebert made several recommendations to improve
patient recruitment and retention:

*  Combine primary care and research visits.
*  Promote a strong relationship between the study nurse and patients.
*  Provide transportation to the study site.
*  Ask patients about factors that might interfere with their participation.
*  Design studies to address retention problems.
*  Study identified problem sites in detail.

HBV Vaccines
Hepatitis Screening/Vaccination Needed in Hong Kong


Hepatitis screening and vaccination programs are desperately needed for
students in Hong Kong, according to a report from the University of Hong Kong.

Researcher Ian B.  Marshall wrote that similar programs should be recommended
for students from Southeast Asia who attend overseas colleges and
universities, including those in the United States ("Screening and Vaccination
for Hepatitis B in Hong Kong University Students," College
Health,1995;44:59-62).

Hepatitis B is endemic in Chinese populations in Hong Kong, with an overall
prevalence of hepatitis B markers of 49.9 percent and an antigen carrier rate
of 9.5 percent.  Ninety percent of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) occurs in
carriers of hepatitis B.

"In spite of improvements in treatment, HCC is still the second most common
cause of all cancer deaths in Hong Kong," Marshall wrote.  "Carriers are also
at risk of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis; combined, these two conditions
are the 10th leading cause of all deaths in the community.

"Active immunization against hepatitis B is safe and effective, with only
minor local and general reactions.  Protective antibody levels are produced in
88 percent to 100 percent of healthy adults who receive a three-dose course of
vaccination.  Because of this high level of seroconversion and presumed
immunogenicity, routine postvaccination testing is not recommended."

In this report Marshall evaluated a campaign to promote screening and
vaccination for hepatitis B in students at the University of Hong Kong.
Students entering the program appeared to have been highly motivated to
receive vaccination and responded well to a mailed recall.

Ninety-eight percent of those eligible had the first dose of vaccine, and more
than 96 percent completed the full course of three vaccinations.  The
prevalence of hepatitis B antigen was 3.59 percent; male students showed
significantly higher prevalence (4.48 percent) than female students (2.97
percent).  Hepatitis B surface antibody prevalence was the same in both sexes
(11.8 percent).

"These levels are about one third the prevalence levels found in the same age
group in the general population in Hong Kong," Marshall wrote.  "It is
recommended that students at secondary schools and postsecondary education
institutions in Hong Kong be offered serological screening and vaccination for
Hepatitis B.  A similar policy is recommended for students from Southeast Asia
who attend overseas colleges and universities including those in the United
States."

Marshall wrote that further studies are needed to assess the effect such a
policy would have in reducing the prevalence rates for hepatitis B markers in
older age groups.

"Significant numbers of young people from Southeast Asian countries, where
prevalence levels for hepatitis B are similar to those in Hong Kong, study in
colleges and universities overseas, particularly in North America, Australian,
and the United Kingdom.  Foreign students studying in the United States have
also been identified as being at higher risk for hepatitis B.  Unless students
from Southeast Asia can provide a vaccination record or laboratory evidence of
immunity, they should be screened for hepatitis B markers before they enter
postsecondary education programs overseas.  HBsAg carriers should be
counseled, and their susceptible household and sexual contacts should receive
hepatitis vaccination, as should those foreign students who test negative for
hepatitis B markers."

Services at the University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong.

Human Papillomavirus (Vaccine Design)
VLPs from One Variant May Help To Prevent Infection


The finding that two human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) variants are
serologically cross-reactive is encouraging news for the development of a
genital HPV vaccine.

Grace Cheng, U.S.  National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland and
colleagues from the U.S.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta, Georgia, and the Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark, set out
to find whether DNA sequence variants of HPV-16 are distinct serotypes.

Cheng et al.  compared the reactivities of women's sera from Zaire (n=97) and
Denmark (n=123) ("Divergent Human Papillomavirus Type 16 Variants Are
Serologically Cross-Reactive," Journal of Infectious Diseases, December
1995;172:1584-1587).

For the comparison, they used IgG-specific ELISAs based on virus-like
particles (VLPs) composed of the L1 major capsid protein derived from an
HPV-16 variant commonly found in central Africa (Z-1194) or from a variant
that is common in northern Europe (114K).  Z-1194 was isolated in Zaire from a
woman with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and who also was positive for
HIV.

"We have found that among the 220 women whose sera were tested, almost all who
had a serologic response to one HPV-16 L1 variant also responded to the
other," wrote Cheng et al.  "Therefore we conclude that strains 114K and
Z-1194 are serologically cross-reactive and likely belong to the same
serotype.  This is the case despite a relatively large number of amino acid
differences in the major capsid proteins of the two strains."

The L1s differed in seven amino acids.  In only one serum sample did the
researchers see evidence for a specific reaction to only one, and not the
other VLP variant.

If data from future research studies, which apply other L1 variants and other
sets of sera, substantiate the current findings, this would have several
implications.

The first such implication would be that the lack of serotypic divergence
would suggest individual genital HPV types have not undergone the type of
antigenic drift (such as that seen in influenza viruses) that changes
seroreactivity to virons.

"This implies either that changes in the major seroreactive virion epitopes
cannot be tolerated or that neutralizing antibodies do not play a dominant
role in controlling genital HPV infection under natural conditions," wrote
Cheng et al.

The results also suggest that an ELISA which is based on a single VLP variant
could be applied for evaluating HPV-16 infection in different populations.

"Finally, these results are encouraging from the point of view of developing a
genital HPV vaccine, since they suggest that VLPs from a single HPV-16 variant
might be effective worldwide in preventing HPV-16 infection," Cheng et al.
wrote.

Many of the nucleotide sequence variants of HPV-16 that have been identified
have been isolated in separate geographic areas (Chan et al., J Virol,
1992;66:2057-2066 and 5714-5725; Ho et al., J Virol, 1993;67:6413-6423).

Reinhard Kirnbauer, a co-author of the current report, and colleagues have
performed numerous VLP-based ELISA studies to investigate HPV-16 infection
(Proc Natl Acad Sci USA, 1992;89:12180-12184; J Virol, 1993;67:6923-6936; J
Natl Cancer Inst, 1994;86:494-504).

Immunology
Discovery of Tumor Antigens Facilitated by Novel Process


Elusive tumor antigens can't hide from SEREX (serological identification of
antigens by recombinant expression cloning).

The success of recombinant tumor vaccines and other immunotherapeutic
modalities in cancer patients is dependent upon the immune systems recognition
of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens.  In spite of extensive
efforts to identify tumor antigens in human neoplasms at the molecular level,
too few have actually been pinpointed.

Ugur Sahin et al.  modified the strategy of autologous typing to allow for an
unbiased search, in addition to the direct molecular definition of,
immunogenic tumor proteins based on their reaction with autologous patient
sera ("Human Neoplasms Elicit Multiple Specific Immune Responses in the
Autologous Host," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, December 5,
1995;92(25):11810-13).

"By applying this strategy of SEREX to four unselected human tumors of
different origin, we discovered an unexpected frequency of tumor antigens that
elicit specific immune responses in the autologous host," stated Sahin et al.
"Since the molecular definition of tumor antigens by SEREX of tumor cDNA is
fast and has a high yield, it may make sense to first define tumor antigens by
SEREX and then to analyze their role in T-cell immunity.  Such a strategy
could provide a rapidly expanding basis for additional approaches to the
immunotherapy and gene therapy of human neoplasms."

The cDNA libraries from diagnostic biopsies of four patients with malignant
melanoma, brain tumor, renal cancer, and Hodgkin disease, were expressed in E.
coli.  In order to test for clones expressing antigens against which the
autologous patient had specific antibodies, 1x10(6) recombinant clones from
each tumor cDNA were screened.  An ELISA modified for the exclusive detection
of human IgG antibodies was used.

Of the 5x10(6) clones tested, 109 were found to be reactive with IgG
antibodies in the serum sample of the autologous patient.  Cross-hybridization
experiments determined that the 109 positive clones contained 24 different
inserts.  From four patients, 24 different antigens were discovered, noted the
authors.

The autologous typing strategy that was modified by the authors was first
developed by L.J.  Old and reported in the 1981 issue of Cancer Research,
41:361-75.

In order to determine the occurrence of antibodies against these newly defined
tumor antigens, different tumor patients and healthy controls donated blood
for testing against these antigens.  Antibodies against the tumor antigens
were detected at varying rates only in patients with the same type of tumor.

The authors noted that the definition of 24 antigens in four tumors of
different origin suggests that the analysis of B-cell responses against other
tumors of the same or new types may identify an unexpected abundance of human
tumor antigens.  Their results suggested that tumor immunogenicity in the
autologous host is a common phenomenon and not restricted to malignant
melanomas.

In addition, the immunogenicity of human tumors seems not to be due to the
expression of a single antigen, but is conferred by multiple antigens.  Their
observation that antibodies against the new antigens could only be found in
the sera of patients bearing the same type of tumor suggested that tumor
growth is essential for the development of a humoral immune response against
the respective tumor antigens, and that antibody production is not an
autoimmune effect elicited by tumor-independent mechanisms.

The authors noted that their study was different from other studies which used
sera to detect antibodies.  Other studies have relied on low-titer serum
antibodies or human monoclonal antibodies generated in vitro from patients'
lymphocytes.  Theirs, on the other hand, uses a stringent serological
detection system which is limited to antigens that elicit high-titer IgG
responses in the patient in vivo.

"According to our data, overexpression of antigens in the tumor compared to
normal tissues seems to be the most common reason for immunogenicity,"
concluded Sahin et al.  "Our observation that tumor antigens defined by T-cell
responses such as MAGE-1 and tyrosinase can also be detected by the
serological approach suggest that an integrated immune response against tumor
antigens may exist that involves both CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells as well as B
cells."

Industry News (Vaccines)
Survival Improvement Shown in Breast Cancer Trial with Theratope


Dr.  Grant MacLean, Medical Oncologist and principal investigator for
Biomira's clinical study at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada, presented results of Biomira's Phase II clinical trials of Theratope
therapeutic vaccine, in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

The meeting "Novel Vaccine Strategies:  Immunotherapeutic Strategies for
Cancer" Conference was held in San Diego, California.  Theratope is a
non-toxic therapy designed to stimulate the immune system of cancer patients
to respond against the cancer.  The study was conducted over a 2-1/2 year
period at the Cross Cancer Institute in Edmonton and Guy's Hospital in London,
United Kingdom (U.K.).

Among 48 women in a randomized clinical trial, MacLean reported that 24 who
received Theratope in its standard investigational program had a statistically
significant increase in survival over 24 women in the other study group who
did not receive the standard immunomodulation prior to Theratope treatment.
The women on the standard Theratope program have a projected median survival
of 19.7 months versus 12.6 months for the other study group, with statistical
significant at P=0.018.

In addition to increased survival, the women on the standard Theratope program
had statistically significant higher levels of antibodies against a specific
molecule, Sialyl-Tn (STn), found on the surface of breast cancer cells, than
was observed with those who received the alternate Theratope program.

Since receiving the analysis of the data, Biomira has been consulting with
clinical investigators and scientists about these results and will be
contacting regulatory officials in the U.S., Canada and Europe to discuss
their recommendations for the next steps to take Theratope therapeutic vaccine
to commercialization for women who suffer from metastatic breast cancer.

Influenza
Killer Flu Expected


Influenza could develop a new form and trigger a worldwide epidemic at any
time, experts caution.

At a conference of more than 200 infectious disease specialists, work has
started on a plan to prepare for what some believe is an inevitable pandemic,
or worldwide epidemic, of killer flu.

John LaMontagne of the U.S.  National Institutes of Health (NIH) said at the
conference that the flu virus is "dynamic and very resourceful" and can change
rapidly into forms that overwhelm natural human defenses.  "We anticipate we
will have another pandemic, but we don't know when," he said.

Dr.  Dominick Iacuzio of the U.S.  National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said concern about another pandemic led to his
organizing the conference.  "It has happened before, and it can happen again,"
he said.

The last major worldwide flu epidemic was in 1968, the so-called "Hong Kong
flu."  New strains of the flu virus typically sweep through the international
population every ten to 40 years.

"Some experts say we are overdue," said Iacuzio.

Alan Hansen of the World Health Organization (WHO) said modern transportation
makes it possible for new flu viruses to touch every continent within a matter
of weeks - it once took many months.

In 1918-1919, a new viral strain infected more than 2 billion people and
killed an estimated 20 million to 40 million.  The "Asian flu" in 1957 was
also new and caused 750,000 deaths in the United States alone.

Iacuzio said the Bethesda, Maryland, conference was called to help
international experts identify the gaps in what is known about the flu virus
and its control.

A formal report is being prepared, but these findings will be among the
conclusions, he said:

* Increased surveillance, particularly in remote Asian areas, is needed for
early detection of new flu viral strains.  If a potentially new form of the
flu is found early enough, said Iacuzio, the pandemic could be blunted by
rapidly producing a new vaccine.

* Some experts believe the concentration of proteins used in the flu vaccine
could be reduced, thus making more doses available.  "We don't know the
answers to this," said Iacuzio, and that knowledge could be critical if there
is a sudden, worldwide need for vaccine.

* Final work on vaccines that can be applied as nose spray or nose drops must
be completed.  These so-called "cold-adapted vaccines" use modified live virus
and have been shown to be effective in some studies.  Iacuzio said their
availability in a pandemic could save many lives by protecting people against
the disease.

* Antivirals, drugs used to treat the flu infections, could provide physicians
with important new weapons in treating patients already infected.  Iacuzio
said candidate drugs are being tested, but are not available.  Such drugs need
to be speedily developed, he said.

Malaria Vaccines
SPf66 Vaccine Candidate Is Produced Under GMP Criteria


The malaria vaccine candidate SPf66 can be reproducibly manufactured, which is
essential for performing large-scale trials.

For large morbidity and mortality trials to study SPf66 (being considered for
the World Health Organization) to be interpretable, the product must be well
characterized, meet standardized release criteria and perform consistently,
noted W.R.  Ballou, Department of Immunology, Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research, Washington, D.C., and colleagues.

Ballou et al.  presented their findings at the 44th Annual Meeting of the
American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, San Antonio, Texas,
November 17-21, 1995 ("Characterization of the Peptide Polymer SPf66 Malaria
Vaccine, abstract 325, American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,
1995;53(2):194-195).

"Our data indicate that SPf66 can be reproducibly manufactured and provide a
rational basis for developing reference standards for in-process and final
product release criteria," wrote Ballou et al.  in their presentation
abstract.

The methods of analysis the researchers used included the following:  mass
spectroscopy, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, size
exclusion chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid
analysis, sequence analysis, assessment of free thiols and determination of
counter ions.

"These analyses indicate that SPf66 exists as a mixture of monomeric and
multimeric species, but in our hands, the ratios of these species are
remarkably consistent from lot to lot," Ballou et al.  wrote.

Although the manufacturing process for SPf66 has the potential to produce
peptide with substantial variability from lot to lot, Ballou et al.  produced
several lots of SPf66 under good manufacturing practices (GMP) for the
specific purpose of product characterization and to establish standardization
criteria.

In a related report, Ballou et al.  said they established an assay that may be
applicable in making sure that vaccine lots are uniform ("Analysis of Potency
of the SPf66 Malaria Vaccine," abstract 324, American Journal of Tropical
Medicine and Hygiene, 1995;53(2):194).

The assay also may be suitable for comparing differences with new SPf66
formulations.

Data about immunogenicity from numerous clinical trials of SPf66 have had
seroconversion rates that varied significantly.  This variability could not be
easily explained by differences in the populations that were vaccinated, noted
Ballou et al.

"We have established a potency assay in BALB/c mice in which the read out is
antibody response following intraperitoneal immunization at various dilutions
of vaccine," wrote Ballou et al.  "SPf66 can be shown to have a very steep
dose response curve in this system which permits comparison among various
vaccine formulations."

Using this model, the researchers showed that a low molecular weight component
purified from SPf66 peptide by size exclusion chromatography essentially is
nonimmunogenic.  The low molecular weight component does not bind well to
aluminum hydroxide and comprises a substantial portion of SPf66.  The
variability in its content among clinical lots may have contributed to the
disparate results obtained in human vaccine studies, Ballou et al.  said.

"Whether vaccine potency as measured by this assay in any way correlates with
efficacy has not been established, but this system may be useful as a release
assay to insure comparability among vaccine lots and to compare differences
with new SPf66 formulations," wrote Ballou et al.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus
Human RSV Succumbs to Bioengineering Techniques


Bioengineered production of infectious human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
provides immediate applications for the development of a live attenuated
vaccine.

RSV is considered the most important pediatric viral respiratory pathogen
worldwide.  It is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality and
lacks an approved vaccine or effective antiviral therapy.  In addition to the
lack of a good animal model (other than the chimpanzee), RSV does not grow
well in culture.  Both of these problems have impeded research, making the
development of a vaccine difficult.

Peter L.  Collins et al.  produced infectious human RSV from cloned cDNA
particles in vitro paving the way for development of live attenuated vaccine
strains ("Production of Infectious Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus from
Cloned cDNA Confirms an Essential Role for the Transcription Elongation Factor
from the 5' Proximal Open Reading Frame of the M2 mRNA in Gene Expression and
Provides a Capability for Vaccine Development," Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, December 5, 1995;92(25):11563-67).

"An exciting possibility is that RSV might be engineered in ways that enhance
its immunogenicity and induce a level of protection greater than that provided
by natural infection," noted Collins et al.  In addition "RSV can be evaluated
as a possible vector for protective antigens of other respiratory tract
pathogens.  An RSV vector also might have utility in transient gene therapy of
the respiratory tract."

The cloned RSV was produced by the intracellular coexpression of five
plasmid-born cDNAs.  One encoded a complete positive-sense version of the RSV
genome, and each of the other four encode a separate RSV protein.  If any of
these were deleted, RSV was not produced.  The cDNA segments were synthesized
by reverse transcription (RT)-coupled PCR (RT-PCR) from intracellular RSV mRNA
or virion-derived genome RNA.

They noted that the strategy for producing infections RSV from cDNA-express
antigenome involved its coexpression with those RSV proteins that were
necessary and sufficient to complete two important processes:  1) the ability
to produce an antigenomic nucleocapsid capable of RNA replication and 2) to
render the progeny genomic nucleocapsid competent for both RNA replication and
transcription.  Transcription by the genomic nucleocapsid would then provide
all of the other RSV proteins and initiate a productive infection.

Recently, this approach was successfully accomplished with two rhabdoviruses,
rabies and vesicular stomatitis virus, by M.J.  Schnell et al.  (EMBO J.,
1994;13:4195-4203) and N.D.  Lawson et al.  (PNAS, 1995;92:4477-81).

The possibility also exists that defined mutations can be introduced into
these infectious RSV clones.  This could have multiple applications toward the
understanding of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of this particularly
difficult to study virus.

"It may be possible to insert foreign sequence into the RSV genome for
coexpression," concluded Collins et al.  "Genes of interest for evaluation
include those encoding cytokines, antagonists thereof, or proteins rich in
T-helper-cell epitopes.  This offers the possibility of modifying and
improving the immune response quantitatively and qualitatively."

GM-CSF Secreting Tumor Cells."  J.S.  Yu, J.A.  Butwick, G.  Dkanoff, E.A.
Chiocca and X.O.  Breakefield.  Neurosurgery Service and Molecular

Neurogenetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown,

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting
of the Society for Neuroscience, held November 11-16, 1995, in San Diego,
California, "We have developed an ex vivo gene therapy paradigm for the
treatment of brain tumors using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF).  The murine B16 melanoma and the GL 261 glioma lines were
infected with MFG recombinant retrovirus containing the mouse GM-CSF cDNA.
The tumor lines were confirmed to secrete GM-CSF by ELISA.  Subcutaneous
vaccination of syngeneic mice with irradiated GM-CSF-secreting B16 melanoma
cells completely protected animals from subsequent intracranial B16 tumor
inoculation.  Histologic evaluation revealed the presence of neutrophils,
eosinophils and lymphocytes in the intracerebral inoculation site.  In
contrast, animals vaccinated with irradiated B16 cells or not vaccinated
succumbed to intracranial tumor within 3 weeks after inoculation.  Treatment
of established intracranial B16 melanoma tumors with subcutaneous injection of
irradiated GMCSF secreting B16 cells increased median survival as compared to
injection of irradiated B16 cells or no treatment.  In addition, treatment of
intracerebral glioma with subcutaneous vaccination with irradiated,
GM-CSF-secreting autologous cells also increased survival compared to
controls.  Histologic examination revealed a dramatic perivascular lymphocytic
infiltrate beginning 3 days after treatment with GM-CSF transduced cells which
was not found in controls."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 25th Annual Meeting

California, "Immunity to tumors develops following ganciclovir (GCV) treatment
of brain tumors expressing the Herpes Simplex Virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)
gene.  To study if HSV-TK by itself might contribute to the anti-tumor
immunogenicity, the growth of non-immunogenic D74 tumors, wild type (D74-w.t.)
and TK-modified D74 (D74-TK) brain tumor cells, were studied in naive rats and
rats previously treated and cured of 9L, tumors by HSV-TK and GCV treatments.
Formation of the D74-TK tumors were significantly reduced in both naive and
pretreated rats, even though the in vitro growth rate of these tumors was
similar.  Analysis of immune cells infiltrating the tumors revealed a
significant increase in the CD4 positive cells in TK-modified tumor cells in
the previously treated rats.  Furthermore the regression of the D74-TK tumors
was greater in the previously treated rats.  These findings suggest that even
in non immunogenic tumors, the expression of HSV-TK slows the tumor formation,
that can be associated with the immune response.  This immunity could be
exploited by vaccination strategies to increase tumor regression seen with
HSV-TK and GCV treatments.  Supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Sedegah, H.  Wang, M.  Kaur, P.  Hobart and S.L.  Hoffman.  Malaria Program,

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 44th Annual Meeting
of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, held November 17-21,
1995, in San Antonio, Texas, "We recently reported that Plasmodium yoelii CSP
DNA vaccines induced specific antibodies and nearly complete CD8(+)
CTL-dependent protection against sporozoite challenge in BALB/c mice.
Preliminary studies have now shown that a full-length P.  yoelii SSP2 (PySSP2)
DNA vaccine protected approximately 50% of A/J mice.  In an effort to improve
upon the results with PySSP2, we constructed two DNA vaccine plasmids both of
which contained a truncated PySSP2 gene lacking the 5' terminal region of the
gene thought to encode the native signal peptide:  one contained an in-frame
fusion with a mammalian (tPA) signal peptide while the other one remained
signal minus.  The ability of both plasmids to express PySSP2 in vitro was
demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of the cell pellet and culture supernatant
material from transiently transfected COS-7 cells.  An immunoreactive band of
an expected molecular mass was detected with anti-PySSP2 Mab (NYS4) in both
fractions from cells transfected with the tPAPySSP2 plasmid but only in the
cell pellet material of the COS-7 cell cultures transfected with the signal
minus plasmid.  The ability of these plasmids to induce protective immunity is
being evaluated in multiple strains of mice.  So far, both BALB/c and A/J mice
have produced antibodies after a single immunization with the tPA-PySSP2 DNA
vaccine as determined by IFAT; the immunoreactive pattern on sporozoites was
similar in appearance to that obtained with NYS4.  Mice immunized with the
signal minus construct have not yet produced measurable antibodies to
sporozoites.  Initial protection studies and the results of the ongoing
immunogenicity and protection studies will be presented."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 44th Annual Meeting
of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, held November 17-21,
1995, in San Antonio, Texas, "We report here the effect on blood stage
development of the vaccination of 5 non-splenectomized chimpanzees with 4
Plasmodium falciparum liver stage proteins:  Liver Stage Antigen 1 (LSA-1) and
3 (LSA-3), Sporozoite Threonine and Asparagin Rich Protein (STARP), and
Sporozoite And Liver Stage Antigen (SALSA).  LSA-1 is specific to liver stages
while LSA-3, SALSA, and STARP are also expressed by the sporozoite.  To
activate multiple immune mechanisms using the same antigen, 3 types of
immunization per chimpanzee were used:  immunization by lipopeptides only, by
peptides associated with the adjuvant Moutaulde ISA 31 (SEPIC, Paris France),
and by recombinant proteins associated with the some adjuvant.  One chimpanzee
per vaccine candidate was used; a control animal was immunized with adjuvant
only.  After the course of vaccination each chimpanzee received a dose
containing 120,000 sporozoites intravenously at day 0.  The control animal
developed a parasitemia of 270 parasites/(micro)l at day 7.  Parasitemia
decreased rapidly to 15 parasites/(micro)l the next day, and no parasites were
detectable at day 10.  The 2 chimpanzee vaccinated with LSA-1 and SALSA
developed identical parasitemias (270 parasites/(micro)l at day 7).
Interestingly, the chimpanzee vaccinated with STARP developed a 3 fold greater
parasitemia at day 7.  In marked contrast, the chimpanzee vaccinated with
products from the protein LSA-3 developed a 3 times lower parasitemia than the
non-protected animals at day 7 (80 parasites/(micro)l).  According to the time
of maturation of liver stage of P.  falciparum (minimum of 6 days),
parasitemia observed 7 days after sporozoite inoculation is directly linked
with merozoites from the hepatic stage, and not from blood-stage
multiplication.  Thus, the decreased parasitemia observed for the LSA-3
vaccinated animal could be linked with a protective immune mechanism.
Although this experiment does not allow to prove vaccine efficacy, interest of
such research using limited a number of Apes will be discussed with reference
to these observation."

California.

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 44th Annual Meeting
of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, held November 17-21,
1995, in San Antonio, Texas, "We have demonstrated that intramuscular (IM)
immunization with a plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Plasmodium yoelii CSP
protein (PyCSP) induces high antibody levels and cytotoxic T cells against
PyCSP, and induces a CD8(+) T-cell dependent protection in 85% of BALB/c mice.
In preparation for development of DNA vaccines designed to produce protective
antibodies against P.  falciparum erythrocytic stage antigens, we conducted
studies to optimize antibody responses in Aotus monkeys after immunization
with the PyCSP DNA vaccine.  Groups of 3 monkeys were immunized at 3 week
intervals with 125, 500, or 2000 (micro)g PyCSP DNA.  IM alone (tibialis
anterior), IM after pre-treatment with 0.25% bupivacaine, and intradermal (ID)
routes were compared.  Only monkeys immunized by the ID route produced
antibodies against sporozoites.  Antibody titers, obtained by indirect
fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) against air-dried sporozoites and by ELISA
using a PyCSP recombinant protein, peaked at 3 weeks after the third ID dose
and were reduced 50% by 7 weeks after the third dose.  There was a trend
toward a dose response with peak geometric mean IFAT titers of 806, 508, and
403 for the 2000, 500, and 125 (micro)g doses respectively.  In a second
experiment antibody responses to a 500 (micro)g dose at multiple sites (2 or
6) were found superior to responses generated by a single site administration.
These data clearly demonstrate that ID immunization generates significantly
better antibody responses to the PyCSP DNA vaccine than IM immunization, and
support the use of the ID route for the initial studies of the efficacy of DNA
vaccines in inducing protective antibodies against P.  falciparum erythrocytic
stage antigens."

According to an abstract submitted by the authors to the 44th Annual Meeting
of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, held November 17-21,
1995, in San Antonio, Texas, "Recent reports indicated that immunization of
mice with GST-PYCI, a recombinant protein based on the Plasmodium yoelii MSP-1
protects against challenge with infected erythrocytes, and immunization of
mice with MAP4 (QGPGAP)4 P2P30, a multiple antigen peptide based on the P.
yoelii CS protein protects against sporozoite challenge.  The current studies
were designed to determine if:  (1) GST-PYC2 (a modified GST PYC1) protects
against sporozoite challenge, and (2) if immunization with GST-PYC2 plus MAP4
(OGPGAP)4 P2P30 would provide additive or synergistic protection.  Groups of
10 mice were immunized with individual or combined vaccine emulsified in
TiterMax adjuvant and challenged with P.  yoelii sporozoites.  One of 10 mice
immunized with GSTPYC2 was completely protected against sporozoite challenge.
The remaining nine mice had significantly lower levels of parasitemia on the
last day of follow up (day 14) than did control mice (P<0.01 ).  Immunization
with the combined vaccine reduced by 50% the level of parasite specific
antibodies as compared to that induced by the individual components.
Nonetheless, 50% of the mice immunized with the combined vaccine, 40% of the
mice immunized with MAP4 (QGPGAP)4 P2P30 vaccine, and 10% of the mice
immunized with the GST-PYC2 vaccine were fully protected.  This modest
increase in protection in the combination group was not statistically
significant, but may have been a reflection of additive activity of antibodies
against each immunogen.  These studies provide a foundation and direction for
work designed to optimize the construction, delivery, and assessment of
multicomponent malaria vaccines."

Suppresses Melanoma Tumor Growth."  Annals of Surgical Oncology, November
1995;2(6):542-549.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Annals of
Surgical Oncology, "BACKGROUND:  Melanoma is the fastest rising cancer in the
United States.  Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been genetically engineered
to actively express and secrete the cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2).  Both BCG
and IL-2 have known potent antitumor and immunomodulatory properties.
METHODS:  This recombinant BCG (rBCG 3A) has been tested as an intratumoral
injection and a vaccine therapy in conjunction with irradiated tumor cells
against melanoma in the murine B16 melanoma model.  RESULTS:  The transfection
process did not adversely alter the function of the wild-type (WT) BCG.  rBCG
3A and WT BCG are equally effective intratumoral and vaccine therapies against
melanoma when compared with normal saline control groups.  Tumor burdens were
significantly smaller (P less than or equal to 0.01 and 0.05) for the
treatment groups for both intratumoral and vaccine administration of therapy.
Immunization with rBCG 3A and WT BCG 14 days before a B16 challenge resulted
in an similar to 45% smaller tumor burden when compared with controls.
CONCLUSIONS:  Novel therapies based on the immunogenic properties of melanoma
combined with molecular technologies may offer promise for an effective and
safe treatment of melanoma."  The corresponding author for this study is:  RB

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, "A
recombinant Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vector-based
vaccine that secretes the V3 principal neutralizing epitope of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) could induce immune response to the epitope and
prevent the viral infection.  By using the Japanese consensus sequence of
HIV-1, we successfully constructed chimeric protein secretion vectors by
selecting an appropriate insertion site of a carrier protein and established
the principal neutralizing determinant (PND)-peptide secretion system in BCG.
The recombinant BCG (rBCG)-inoculated guinea pigs were initially screened by
delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reactions to the PND peptide,
followed by passive transfer of the DTH by the systemic route.  Further,
immunization of mice with the rBCG resulted in induction of cytotoxic T
lymphocytes.  The guinea pig immune antisera showed elevated titers to the PND
peptide and neutralized HIVMN, and administration of serum IgG from the
vaccinated guinea pigs was effective in completely blocking the HIV infection
in thymus/liver transplanted severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)/hu or
SCID/PBL mice.  In addition, the immune serum IgG was shown to neutralize
primary field isolates of HIV that match the neutralizing sequence motif by a
peripheral blood mononuclear fell-based virus neutralization assay.  The data
support the idea that the antigen-secreting rBCG system can be used as a tool

Vaccines."  Clinical Immunotherapeutics, November 1995;4(5):376-386.


According to the author's abstract of an article published in Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, "Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines
represent a new technology wherein an immunogen is targeted to a specific
immune response mechanism.  Covalent attachment of the Hib polysaccharide to a
protein carrier converts the T cell-independent polysaccharide antigen into a
protein-like T cell-dependent antigen.  The polysaccharide alone is poorly
immunogenic in infants (less than or equal to 12 months old), and conjugation
to a protein carrier results in a protein-like antibody response to the Hib
polysaccharide in infants.  Conjugate vaccines induce mostly IgG antibodies
and immunological memory.  Later vaccination or natural exposure then induces
a booster response to the Hib polysaccharide.  These conjugate vaccines have
dramatically reduced the incidence of Hib disease in many industrialized
countries, and also reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of Hib in unvaccinated
children in populations in which the vaccine is used.  The Hib conjugates have
now been combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine to
reduce the number of injections required for infants.  Finally, the conjugate
technology that has permitted the near elimination of Hib disease has now been
extended to other invasive encapsulated bacterial pathogens."  The

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Virology, "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an attractive candidate for a
live-virus vector for the delivery of foreign antigens.  The Oka vaccine
strain of VZV is safe and effective in humans, and recombinant Oka VZV (ROka)
can be generated by transfecting cells with a set of overlapping cosmid DNAs.
By this method, the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) glycoprotein D (gD2)
gene was inserted into an intergenic site in the unique short region of the
Oka VZV genome.  Expression of gD2 in cells infected with the recombinant Oka
strain VZV (ROka-gD2) was confirmed by antibody staining of fixed cells and by
immunoblot analysis.  Immune electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of
gD2 in the envelope of ROka-gD2 virions.  The ability of ROka-gD2 to protect
guinea pigs against HSV 2 challenge was assessed by inoculating animals with
three doses of uninfected human fibroblasts, fibroblasts infected with ROka
VZV, or fibroblasts infected with ROka-gD2.  Neutralizing antibodies specific
for HSV-2 developed in animals immunized with ROka-gD2.  Forty days after the
third inoculation, animals were challenged intravaginally with HSV-2.
Inoculation of guinea pigs with ROka-gD2 significantly reduced the severity of
primary HSV 2 infection (P<0.001).  These experiments demonstrate that the Oka
strain of VZV can be used as a live virus vector to protect animals from
disease with a heterologous virus."  The corresponding author for this study

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Journal of
Immunology, "The development of effective vaccine strategies for intracellular
pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, is one of the major
frontiers of scientific research.  For the studies described here, the murine
model of Listeria infection was used to evaluate the adjuvant effects of IL-12
when used as an immunization component.  These studies revealed that typically
nonimmunogenic doses of heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes, or soluble
listerial Ag preparations, elicit intense Th1-type Listeria-specific T-cell
responses when administered i.p.  along with recombinant murine IL-12.  In
addition to the Ag-specific production of IL-2 by CD4(+) peritoneal cells that
was elicited, several other correlates of protective responses were noted,
including dramatic induction of CD3(+) and alpha beta TCR(+) cell populations
in the peritoneal cavity and increased expression of class II MHC and
production of IL-12 (upon in vitro restimulation) by peritoneal macrophages.
Protection studies demonstrated that the T-cell responses elicited by a
IL-12-potentiated, heat-killed L.  monocytogenes vaccine were sufficient to
effectively protect mice against challenge with a large dose of virulent
Listeria."  The corresponding author for this study is:  MA Miller, Emory

Hurie, M.B.; Saari, T.N.; Proctor, M.E.; Davis, J.P.  "Hospitals' Responses to
Universal Infant Hepatitis B Vaccination Recommendations."  Pediatrics,
November 1995;96(5 Part 1):875-879.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Pediatrics,
"OBJECTIVE:  To assess the extent to which hospitals in a midwestern state
with low acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) morbidity offered hepatitis B (Hep B)
vaccine to all infants, whether offering infants Hep B vaccine was associated
with hospital geographic location or size, as measured by the number of
births, and how hospital staff resolved key programmatic issues.  METHODS:
The managers of hospital newborn nurseries (n=110) were surveyed by mail.  The
written response rate was 72%; all of the nonresponders were interviewed by
telephone.  The outcome measured was the number of hospitals offering Hep B
vaccine to all infants by geographic region and hospital size.  RESULTS:
Sixty-five percent of the hospitals routinely offered Hep B vaccine to all
infants; these hospitals accounted far 80% of reported Wisconsin births.  In
univariate analysis, the decision to offer infants Hep B vaccine was
associated with both hospital size and hospital location.  After controlling
for size, hospitals in the northeastern region were eight times more likely
(relative risk, 8.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.30, 51.79) to offer infants
Hep B vaccine than hospitals in the southeastern (referent) region.  Regional
differences in reported rates of acute HBV infection do not explain this
finding, because morbidity in the northeastern region (1 per 100,000) is among
the lowest in Wisconsin.  Although more than 80% of hospitals with Hep B
vaccination programs required written informed consent for vaccination, had
standing orders for administering Hep B vaccine to infants whose mothers'
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) test results were known, and had
mechanisms to notify the infants' physicians that the infants had been
vaccinated, only 38% had standing orders for testing mothers whose HBsAg test
results were unknown.  CONCLUSIONS:  Hospitals are not necessarily deterred
from implementing infant Hep B vaccination programs by low community HBV
morbidity.  Hospitals should develop policies to assure that parturient women
with unknown HBsAg status are screened and their infants are appropriately
treated."  The corresponding author for this study is:  MB Hurie, Wisconsin

Pediatrics (Immunization)
Askew, G.L.; Finelli, L.; Lutz, J.; Degraaf, J.; Siegel, B.; Spitalny, K.
"Beliefs and Practices Regarding Childhood Vaccination among Urban Pediatric
Providers in New Jersey."  Pediatrics, November 1995;96(5 Part 1):889-892.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Pediatrics,
"BACKGROUND:  In 1991, the fourth largest measles outbreak in the nation (824
cases) occurred in the Jersey City, New Jersey area.  Data from a subsequent
intervention trial in Jersey City demonstrated that vaccinations were more
likely to be delayed for children who had received care from private rather
than public clinic providers.  In addition, failure to administer multiple
indicated vaccines at a single visit was associated with vaccination delay,
and reluctance to administer multiple vaccines was more common among private
providers.  These findings prompted an investigation of vaccination beliefs
and practices among urban pediatric providers.  METHODS:  A telephone survey
of vaccination beliefs and practices was administered to all pediatric
providers in both private and public clinics in the Paterson and Jersey City
areas.  RESULTS:  Private providers were less likely than public clinic
providers to consider vaccinating children during emergency room visits
(relative risk [RR] = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2-4.2) or hospital
admissions (RR = 13.2; 95% CI = 1.9-92.7) and less likely to believe that all
recommended vaccine doses should be administered simultaneously (RR =
infinite; lower 95% confidence limit = 3.0).  Private providers were less
likely to consider administering live-virus vaccines to children with minor
acute illnesses and low-grade fever (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.2-3.8) or
killed-virus vaccines to children with minor acute illnesses without fever (RR
= 3.4; 95% CI = 1.4-8.5) or with low-grade fever (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.2-3.9).
Private providers were more likely to believe that multiple injections should
be avoided because of potential psychological and physical trauma to the child
(RR = 4.0; 95% CI = 1.3-12.3).  CONCLUSIONS:  Adherence to Standards for
Pediatric Immunization Practices by pediatric providers could improve vaccine
coverage rates among urban children."  The corresponding author for this study

Protective Effect of Neonatal BCG Correlate with Vaccine-Induced Tuberculin
Reaction?."  American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,

November 1995;152(5):1575-1578.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in American Journal
of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, "A case-control study was conducted
in Saudi Arabia, where the same strain of BCG has been used and surveys had
shown that up to 88% of vaccinated children remain tuberculin negative.
Active cases were obtained by surveying the seven tuberculosis centers in 1
yr.  Control subjects were obtained from a nationwide survey of normal
individuals.  Vaccination in both groups was ascertained by history and BCG
scar.  Relative risk of contracting active tuberculosis in the vaccinated
versus unvaccinated and protection was calculated.  protection was as follows:
age group 5 to 14 yr, 82% (55 to 93%); age group 15 to 24 yr, 67% (55 to 77%);
and age group 25 to 34 yr, 20% (-6 to 37%).  We document the uninterrupted
record of protection by BCG administered in the neonatal period and discuss
the significance of vaccination timing.  We concur with other studies that
protection lapsed after about 20 yr.  More importantly, this is the first
large study that documents a lack of tuberculin sensitivity despite
protection.  This challenges the view that sensitization is essential for
protection and supports the 'two-pathway' theory that BCG vaccination could
trigger either protective (Lister type) or antagonistic (tuberculin or Koch
type) reactions and that the most protective vaccines would have little
tuberculin-sensitizing effect because the two pathways are competitive."  The

Peptide Vaccines

Delivery System - Importance of Autologous Alpha 2-Macroglobulin in the
Development of Peptide Vaccine."  Biochemical and Biophysical Research

Communications, November 2, 1995;216(1):399-405.

According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Biochemical and
Biophysical Research Communications, "We have hijacked a process of the
receptor-mediated endocytosis to transport peptide antigens into antigen
presenting cells (APCs) for the purpose of increasing the level of antigen
presentation (named Receptor-Linked Antigen Delivery System (R-LADS)).  By
coupling an endogenous plasma proteinase inhibitor alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha
2M) to a synthetic peptide having a partial sequence of HIV-1 envelope
protein, alpha 2M was made to carry the peptide into APCs as a part of the
normal alpha 2M cycle, which resulted in an increased production of specific
antibodies against the peptide (Mitsuda, S., Nakagawa, T., Osada, T.,
Shimamoto, T., Nakazato, H.  and Ikai, A.  (1993) Biochem.  Biophys.  Res.
Commun.  194, 1155-1160).  We demonstrate here that this procedure becomes a
more efficient tool for antibody production when autologous transporter
protein was used.  By using murine alpha 2M (m alpha 2M) instead of
heterologous human alpha 2M (h alpha 2M) when mice were experimental animals,
we were able to dramatically enhance the production level of anti-HIV-1
peptide antibodies and shorten the period which is needed for antibody
production.  We aim to develop effective peptide vaccines by further improving
this system."  The corresponding author for this study is:  S Mitsuda, Tokyo

Pneumococcal
Shahid, N.S.; Steinhoff, M.C.; Hoque, S.S.; Begum, T.; Thompson, C.; Siber,
G.R.  "Serum, Breast Milk, and Infant Antibody after Maternal Immunisation
with Pneumococcal Vaccine."  Lancet, November 11, 1995;346(8985):1252-1257.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Lancet,
"Pneumococci are a leading cause of severe bacterial disease in infants and
children world wide.  A possible means of protecting infants in the first few
months of life is immunisation of the mother during prospectively assessed
pneumococcal pregnant women to determine the amount pneumococcal antibody
transmitted to the infants in serum and milk and the half-life of the
passively acquired antibody.  Healthy pregnant women in Dhaka, Bangladesh,
were randomized to receive pneumococcal or meningococcal vaccine with routine
prenatal tetanus immunisation at 30-34 weeks of gestation.  Serum and breast
milk specimens from the mothers and sera from infants were collected up to 22
weeks of age and assayed for specific serum IgG, IgG1, and IgG2 and for milk
IgA antibodies to pneumococcal serotypes 6B and 19F.  55 mothers and 56
infants were followed from birth to five months.  Women who received
pneumococcal vaccine had geometric mean antibody increases of 2.6 and 3.4 to
types 6B and 19F, respectively, The mean infant/maternal antibody ratios were
0.56 and 0.59 (range 0.11-1.46) for these serotypes.  Infant cord antibody
titres correlated with maternal titres.  Infant/maternal IgG ratios correlated
with the interval between immunisation and birth and were higher for specific
IgG1 than for IgG2.  Infants of pneumococcal vaccine recipients had geometric
mean antibody concentrations of 6.8 and 7.5 (micro)g/mL to serotypes 6B and
19F in cord blood; in cord blood and in all subsequent serum specimens the
concentrations were 2-3 fold higher than in control infants.  The median
half-life of passive antibody was about 35 days; at five months of age 63-71%
of infants of pneumococcal vaccine recipients had antibody concentrations
greater than 0.15 (micro)g/mL.  Breast milk IgA antibodies for pneumococcal
serotype 19F, but not for type 6B, were significantly higher in vaccine
recipients up to five months after delivery.  If maternal pneumococcal
polysaccharide antibodies do not interfere with active immunisation of the
infant with new glycoprotein conjugate pneumococcal vaccines, passive-active
immunisation of infants can be a feasible strategy for developing regions."

Varicella-Zoster Virus
Perry, C.M.; Bryson, H.M.  "Oka/Merck Varicella Vaccine:  A Review of Its
Immunogenicity and Protective Efficacy Against Varicella."  Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, November 1995;4(5):396-416.


According to the authors' abstract of an article published in Clinical
Immunotherapeutics, "Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine
produced from the Oka strain of the herpesvirus varicella zoster virus (VZV).
The Oka strain of VZV is recognized as having low virulence while eliciting
humoral and cell-mediated responses to VZV.  In numerous studies, Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine achieved a seroconversion rate of >95% in healthy children
and adolescents.  In immunocompromised children with leukaemia in remission,
seroconversion was achieved in 80% of vaccinees 12 months after vaccination.
Cell-mediated immune responses generally closely paralleled humoral immune
responses.  The vaccine is also immunogenic in healthy adults.  In healthy
children, a high level of protection was conferred by Oka/Merck varicella
vaccine, and in the only double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted to
date the vaccine was 98% effective in protecting healthy children against
varicella during 2 varicella seasons.  In children with leukaemia, Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine was 80% effective in protecting against mild varicella and
conferred 100% protection against moderate and severe varicella.  In healthy
adults, the rate of protection against varicella was reported to be
approximately 50%.  All observed cases of varicella in healthy and
immunocompromised vaccinees were mild and there were no reports of ay
disease-related complications.  Interestingly in children and adolescents with
leukaemia, the incidence of herpes tester was lower in children who received
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine than in similar children who had natural immunity.
Mild varicelliform rash (occasionally accompanied by fever) has been observed
in healthy children, adolescents and adults who have received Oka/Merck
varicella vaccine.  Pain at the injection site was the adverse effect most
frequently reported in one large study of the vaccine in healthy children.  In
children with leukaemia, vaccine-associated rash has been reported in up to
50% of vaccinees.  When Oka/Merck varicella vaccine was administered to
healthy children in combination with measles, mumps and rubella vaccine there
was no increase in the incidence of skin rashes compared with that caused by
measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in combination with placebo.  Thus,
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a highly immunogenic vaccine that confers a
high level of protection against typical varicella in healthy children and
adolescents, and in children and adolescents with leukaemia.  While results of
further long term studies investigating the persistence of protective immunity
against varicella are awaited with interest, available darn indicate that
Oka/Merck varicella vaccine is a major advance in the prevention of this
common and highly infectious disease."  The corresponding author for this
