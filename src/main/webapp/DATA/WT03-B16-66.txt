<H1>The '<A NAME="cap">SPOT Standard Digital product format</A>'</H1>

<This format corresponds to the format of the SPOT scene digital products. <p>
These digital products are delivered either on 1/2" magnetic tapes (6250 bpi CCT), Exabytes or on CD-Rom.<p>
It is also called the "CAP format", since it was produced for the "Centre d'Archivage et de Pr&eacute;traitement (CAP)", located at Spot Image in Toulouse as well as SSC-Satellitbild facilities in Kiruna.<p>

This format concerns the SPOT scenes which are processed at level 1A, 1B, 2A or 2B.<p>
This format is upward compatible with the old SPOT Standard Product CCT format and
 is capable of handling the additional Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) band on SPOT 4.<p>

<P>
<A NAME="spot17"><B>Logical Volume</B></A>
<P>
The files in a single SPOT Product Logical Volume are:
<ul>
<li><A HREF="#spot17">Logical Volume</A>
<li><A HREF="#spot18">Volume Directory File</A>
<li><A HREF="#spot19">Leader File</A>
<li><A HREF="#spot20">Imagery File</A>
<li><A HREF="#spot21">Trailer File</A>
<li><A HREF="#spot22">Null Volume Directory File</A>
</li></ul>
<P>
The files are separated by END OF FILE (EOF) tape marks.  The Null Volume 
Directory File is followed by three EOFs designating an END OF SET (EOS).
<P>
Imagery records can have a fixed length of one of the following depending on
the length of the image line:
<PRE>

         3960 bytes (split record size option)
         5400 bytes (line length < 5300 pixels)
         8640 bytes (5301 < line length < 8450 pixels)
        10980 bytes (8541 < line length < 10880 pixels)
</PRE>
<P>
To accommodate image processing systems that cannot read large image record
lengths, a split record format is available.  Digital scenes produced using
this option have a maximum record length of 3960 bytes and are only available
on 1600 bpi magnetic tapes.
<P>
<A NAME="spot18"><B>Volume Directory File</B></A>
<P>
The Volume Directory File is the first file on any SPOT CCT and contains 
information about the logical volume.  It consists of five records of 360 bytes
each:
<P>
<dl>
<dd>Volume Descriptor Record
<dd>Pointer Record for the Leader File
<dd>Pointer Record for the Imagery File
<dd>Pointer record for the Trailer File
<dd>Text Record
</dl>
<P>
The Volume Descriptor record identifies the logical volume within a volume set
and the number of files on this volume.  Each Pointer record references one of
the three data files in the logical volume and identifies the file format used
to read the file.  The Text record contains information about the creation of
the tape and is useful in identifying the tape.
<P>
<A NAME="spot19"><B>Leader File</B></A>
<P>
The Leader File contains auxiliary information related to the SPOT scene 
(identification parameters defining the geometry and the radiometry of the 
scene, preprocessing data, etc.).  The leader file consists of 27 records of 
3960 bytes each:
<dl>
<dd>Leader File Descriptor
<dd>One Header Record
<dd>One Ancillary (Ephemeris/Attitude) Record
<dd>16 Ancillary (Radiometric/Calibration) Records
<dd>One Modelization Record
<dd>One Ancillary (Ground Control Points) Record
<dd>Four Ancillary (Histograms) Records
<dd>One Ancillary (Map Projection) Record
<dd>One Annotation Record
</dl>
The File Descriptor record identifies the data contained within the following
leader file records.
<P>
The Header record contains information about the scene identification, the
scene characteristics including corner latitude and longitude coordinates, the
mission, the preprocessing done to the scene and the organization of the 
Ancillary Data records which follow.
<P>
The remaining records in the Leader file contain information which can be used
to do further processing (radiometric or geometric) and on the preprocessing
applied to the raw SPOT scene.
<P>
<A NAME="spot20"><B>Imagery File</B></A>
<P>
An Imagery File contains one file descriptor record repeated on each physical
volume in the case of multi-volume scenes and; image data records, the total
number depending on the spectral mode and level of processing.
<P>
The Imagery Descriptor record variable segment gives the number and length of
the imagery records; how the image pixels are packed, the left and right margin
locations and the size of the prefix and suffix data.  The range of values
for each pixel is between 1 and 255.  A pixel count of 0 corresponds to a 
nonsignificant radiometric value and is reserved for margins around the imagery
data, and for level 1A bad data lines and dead detectors.
<P>
<A NAME="spot21"><B>Trailer File</B></A>
<P>
The Trailer File contains information about the recording of the magnetic tape
and the preprocessing.  This file consists of three or more records of 1080
bytes each:
<P>
<dl>
<dd>Trailer File Descriptor
<dd>One Trailer Quality Record
<dd>One Geometric Transformation Record
<dd>One Grid Parameter Record
<dd>(n) Rectification Grid Record(s) for Level 2 or S scenes
</dl>
<P>
<A NAME="spot22"><B>Null Volume Directory File</B></A>
<P>
The Null Volume Directory file is the last file recorded on a digital SPOT
scene.  It consists of only one 360 byte record containing a subset of the 
information recorded in the Volume Descriptor record of the Volume Directory
file.  The Null Volume Directory file is followed by three end-of-file (EOF)
markers denoting the end of set.
