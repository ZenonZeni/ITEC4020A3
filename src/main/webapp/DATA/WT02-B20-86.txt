<ul>What is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome?<P>
  
<li>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is an organic brain disorder caused by prenatal
   alcohol exposure. The affected person may have:<BR>
<li>height, weight, and growth deficiencies.<BR>
<li>a specific pattern of facial features.<BR>
<li>central nervous system damage i.e., a unique cluster of behavioral symptoms.</ul><p>

EDUCATING CHILDREN WITH FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME (FAS) and FETAL ALCOHOL EFFECTS (FAE)<P>

   One of the most debilitating characteristics of FAS and FAE is the
   poor ability to adapt to demands of surroundings. Educational
   experiences should make students as independent as possible, both now
   and in the future, with the outcome being adults functioning as fully
   as they are able. For some children, "functional" may mean following
   traditional academic curricula. Many students are fairly accomplished
   in academic subjects. To be independent, they also may need to learn
   to ride buses, prepare meals, use money appropriately, and not only
   perform a job, but use the social skills necessary to keep it.
   Educational goals and objectives should go beyond classroom boundaries
   and target skills to be used not only at school, but in homes and
   communities as successful, productive citizens.<P>
   
   Equally important is instruction of communication skills. Programs
   must depart from traditional models of "speech therapy" or "language
   instruction" and view communication as all the verbal, written,
   gestural, and behavioral skills that allow an individual to
   participate in a social environment. Students with FAS/FAE must be
   taught appropriate ways to relate needs to others, whether verbally or
   through other communication systems. Communication skills should be
   developed in the context of social skills instruction. Because the two
   are inseparable and essential sets of skills to live and work in the
   community, they should be major components of the educational process
   from preschool through to high school. Small children can learn to
   communicate their needs, interact with peers, and respond to others
   appropriately. By high school, students should be teaming more complex
   communication and social skills, such as how to interact with
   employers and coworkers, make and maintain friendships, and behave
   with friends of the opposite sex.<P>

  What Educators Need To Know about Having Students with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome

  The information needs of regular elementary teachers concerning the special 
needs of students who have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol 
Effects (FAE) were assessed.  A literature review covers means of 
identification of these disorders, intervention, effective instructional 
strategies, and issues involved with FAS and FAE.  Observations were undertaken 
with a first grade teacher and a child who is alcohol-affected but not yet 
identified as having FAS/FAE.  An informal interview was also conducted with a 
special education teacher who was helping the first grade teacher in having the 
child tested to receive special services.  Additionally, a questionnaire was 
completed by nine teachers in the same elementary school regarding the extent 
of teacher knowledge concerning FAS/FAE as well as information needs.  It was 
concluded that alcohol-affected children have learning disabilities, poor 
social skills, and disruptive behavior.  Forty-four percent of the teachers had 
a student suspected of having either FAS or FAE, and 11 percent had a student 
who had been identified.  Appendices include an observation form, a 
questionnaire, interview questions, and a handout for educators on FAS and FAE.

  This publication's instructional strategies were collected over a three-year 
period from participants in a series of workshops which dealt with fetal 
alcohol and other drug-affected children in the educational setting.  These 
strategies are not intended to be all inclusive; rather, they are intended to 
celebrate the "wisdom of practice." The approaches listed here have not been 
evaluated as to their effectiveness, but are based on sound guidelines for 
working with children who may have been prenatally exposed to alcohol or others 
drugs.  The strategies should provide the educator with a springboard for his 
or her own creativity and expertise.  Each strategy is organized into sections 
by grade level: Preschool; Kindergarten through 6th Grade; Junior High/Middle 
School; and High School.  Each grade level is then divided into three sections, 
with each section featuring sub-categories: (1) Room Environment (Quiet Zones, 
Classroom Seating, Limit Distractions, Organized Materials, Clear Rules for 
Classroom and Learning Centers); (2) Active Learning (Use Multiple Modalities, 
Multi-sensory, Manipulatives; Keep Steps Simple; Provide Opportunities for 
Decision Making and Problem Solving; Model and Demonstrate Behaviors; Provide 
Structure); and (3) Routine (Daily Schedule, Consistent Schedule, Plan for 
Change, Build in Transitions, Use Visual, Auditory, and Sensory Cues).  (RJM)<BR>

  This digest briefly summarizes available information on the educational needs 
of prenatally substance exposed infants and children.  Estimated incidence 
figures are given for the numbers of children exposed in utero to illicit drugs 
and alcohol.  The importance of parent/caregiver education in specific 
techniques to increase infant alertness and interactions is stressed.  Sixteen 
recommended classroom strategies are grouped into protective factors (e.g., 
developmentally appropriate curricula) and facilitative processes (e.g., 
encouraging child attachment to an adult and allowing child decision making).  
Transdisciplinary/transagency approaches to program development are encouraged.  
Also listed are five references and six resources, including hotlines and 
organizations.  (DB)<BR>

  Given our schools' mission to teach all children in regular classrooms, 
working with children damaged by prenatal substance exposure is tremendously 
challenging.  Even the best-taught lesson may be forgotten within a day or an 
hour.  Teachers should reduce the excitability factor, keep a uniform pattern 
of change, give advance warning, follow through, and establish bonding.  (MLH)<BR>

factors at birth and experienced more illnesses after birth; scored lower on 
conceptual development and higher on expression of feelings and peer 
interaction; and displayed more physically violent behavior patterns.  (HTH)<BR>

  This guide was developed to provide effective and practical strategies to 
meet the needs of prenatally substance-exposed children in preschool or day 
care settings.  Techniques are based on good child development practices and 
are equally effective for both teachers and parents.  The first chapter 
outlines information about prenatal substance exposure, such as the effects of 
different drugs on the fetus and the resulting behaviors and learning 
characteristics.  The second chapter presents teaching strategies, including 
protective factors involving daily routines, transitions, and rules; 
facilitative factors such as relationships, peer sensitivity, and decision 
making; and strategies for play, communication development, motor development, 
social/emotional development, and home-school partnerships.  Characteristics of 
an exemplary child development program are then described in chapter 3. 
Practical guidelines are offered for dealing with parents with chemical 
dependency in chapter 4. The final chapter focuses on assessment and offers a 
preschool assessment protocol consisting of a parent interview and 
developmental history, administration of developmental screening tests and 
instruments, play observation, and behavioral observations.  An appendix lists 
organizational resources, training resources, written resources, videotapes, 
audiotapes, free reference materials, newsletters, and other resources; another 
appendix defines terms.  (Each chapter contains references.) (JDD)<BR>
