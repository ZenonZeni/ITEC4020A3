</TD><TD width=350 valign=top align=left><H1>Greed of Olympic Proportions



</H1><P>



<P><B>The unparalleled greed of the U.S. Olympic Committee has forced many



American companies to source Olympic products overseas.   The demands of

the Olympic Committee for multi-million dollar up-front payments and guarantees



has virtually assured that most U.S. Olympic souvenirs are imported from

low-wage countries, and from countries where child labor is rampant.</B>



<P><B>	J.C. Penney and Champion are the official suppliers of Olympic T-shirts,



jackets and hats. Together they paid about $40 million to the U.S. Olympic



Committee, a handsome fee which will be used to pay for the Atlanta Games.

 It is a disgrace to see excellent American manufacturers like Champion forced

to go overseas.  But these massive payments have forced these suppliers to

shop for the cheapest sources around the globe in order to have a profit

margin large enough to offset the Olympic-class royalties.  And the cheapest



sources of labor are often children working in sweatshops in Latin America

and Asia.</B>



<P><B>	The vendors of Olympic products are not doing as well as planned.

 The vendors in Atlanta and around the United States are complaining that



consumers are not buying the overpriced Olympic wares.  </B>



<P><B>Apparently, shortsighted manufacturers and retailers assumed that it



doesn't matter where these products are made.  But fully 40% of the American



consumers will not buy imported clothing.  The percentage may even be higher

for sales of  patriotic paraphernalia such as U.S. Olympic hats and jackets.



 </B>



<P><B>	The U.S. Olympic Committee shares in both the revenue and the blame

for consumers reluctance to buy U.S. Olympic hats for $16 that are made in



Taiwan.  The U.S. Olympic Committee could require products using the Olympic



symbols to be made in the USA.  But it will take an act of Congress to make

sure the next round of Olympic souvenirs are made in the USA. </B>



<P><B>	The current Olympic law, 36 U.S.C. 380,  is printed on official Olympic



labels and appears in television commercials.  Under that law the U.S. Olympic



Committee has the authority to set product standards and can require products



wearing the U.S. Olympic Committee label to be made in the USA.  </B>



<P><B>But the Committee has only used its authority to accept the highest

bid for sponsorship.  The Made in the USA Foundation is drafting legislation

that would require sponsors of the U.S. Olympic Teams to be American



manufacturers or service providers.  This will end embarrassments such as

the Japanese-made Suburu being the official car of the U.S. Ski Team.</B>



<P><B>	While the U.S. Olympic Committee urges consumers to "buy the real

thing," its activities have virtually insured that the "real thing" is made

is a Third World country.  The official Olympic T-shirt sold at J.C. Penney

for $16 and $17 is made by Champion but stitched in Costa Rica.  The U.S.



Department of Labor confirms that there are many child laborers in Costa

Rica. Olympic pants ($24) and Olympic jacket ($35), under the J.C. Penney

label, are made in Malaysia.  U.S. Department of Labor investigators have

been to Malaysia documenting child labor in many industries. </B>



<P><B>Another Olympic jacket under the Penney label is made in Hong Kong.

 The USA Olympic hat with five Olympic rings that is made in Taiwan sells

for $16 at Penney's.  Thirty-eight members of Congress wrote to the Olympic



Committee complaining that adidas soccerballs to be used in the Atlanta Games



were made by young children in Pakistan.  The bipartisan group led by Congressman



Joseph Kennedy II wrote "The Olympics represents the ultimate accomplishment

of a young athlete--it should NOT use a soccer ball which represents the

ultimate repression of children across the globe."</B>



<P><B>	Olympics used to be about sports, about world-class amateur athletes

from around the world competing for the honor of the sport.  I am tired of

seeing exploitation of the Olympics by Reebok and Nike and other commercial



interests.  And Nike isn't even an official sponsor of the Atlanta Games.

 It supplies shoes and outfits to many runners and other athletes.  Nike

built a Niketown in the middle of the Atlanta Games complex so that its



omnipresent "Swoosh" gives the appearance of being Olympic.</B>



<P><B>	Take a look at what countries are doing well at the games.  Costa

Rica, Taiwan and Malaysia, three large U.S. Olympic product suppliers, are

low on Olympic gold, silver and bronze, but have taken Olympic green away

from deserving U.S. suppliers of hats and shirts.  </B>



<P><B>	The best way to send a message to these Olympic charlatans is to just

say no.  Don't buy U.S. Olympic products that are imports.  Write your



congressman and tell him or her that there oughta be a law that requires

U.S. Olympic sponsors to make their souvenirs in the United States.  The

Atlanta Games were supposed to be America's Games.  We should support the

real home team, the American workers, who against all odds continue to make



top-quality products in the United States.</B>
