If you thought yesterday was beautiful, you haven't seen nothin' yet! Today we enter the magical Wallowa Valley. The beauty and wonder of this area is truly astounding; it doesn't take long to understand why those who visit are compelled to return.
<P>
In Wallowa, lunch is served at the site of the annual Wallowa Band Nez Perce Pow Wow and Friendship Feast. Wallowa County provided the last stronghold of the Wallowa Band of Nez Perce Indians. Chief Joseph, noted for his commitment to his people and the land, left behind a legacy that endures to this day. Today, residents depend on the land for their livelihoods in farming, ranching, logging and milling. It's a small (pop. 800) close knit community where everyone greets everyone with a smile.
<p>
On our way to Joseph, our overnight destination, we pass through the largest of the Wallowa Valley communities, Enterprise (population 1,940). All kinds of surprises can happen in Enterprise, so be ready! On the way out of town, watch the fields to the right for the big black Clysdale work horses bred and raised here.
<P>
Nestled on the edge of the Eagle Cap Wilderness, we finally come to Joseph, a thriving art community bustling with charm. With much to see and do here, it may be difficult to take advantage of all the town has to offer. Whether it's a visit to one of the many galleries, shops or museums, you won't be disappointed. (Joseph merchants have kindly agreed to extend their hours just for us!) In terms of entertainment, if there's a theme to be had, think Cowboys!
<p>
Just outside of town is beautiful Wallowa Lake. Consider taking the tram up to the summit of Mt. Howard (elevation 8,300 ft.) for some spectacular views. For those of you mountain bikers, consider exploring some true wilderness. Call Paul Grow, (503) 432-2453, for further information.
