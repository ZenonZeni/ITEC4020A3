<B>Algoma, Wawa Forest Companies Unite<BR> to Apply for Sustainable Forest Licence 

</B>

</CENTER><P>


Five Sault Ste. Marie area forest companies today advised the Ministry of Natural Resources that they are in a position to negotiate a Sustainable Forest Licence (SFL) for the Algoma and Wawa Management Units.<P>

A shareholders' agreement between St. Marys Paper Ltd., AGAWA Forest Products Ltd., Midway Lumber Mills Ltd., Jager Strandboard Limited Partnership, and Levesque Plywood Ltd., will pave the way for the companies to apply to MNR for an SFL.<P>

"The shareholders agreement is a major step toward the development of Sustainable Forest Licences for the Algoma and Wawa management units," said Natural Resources Minister            Chris Hodgson.  "This is part of our new business relationship with the forest industry that will ensure the long-term sustainability of resources and forest-dependent communities."<P>
  
An SFL is a 20-year renewable licence through which the licensee becomes responsible for all aspects of forest management planning and renewal.  In return, the licence provides the company with access to a long-term wood supply and greater control over forest operations and planning activities.  The company also has its own account in the Forest Renewal Trust fund.  With this fund, a portion of the harvesting fees paid by the company are collected for future silvicultural works on its SFL management unit.<P> 	

"Our companies are committed to sustainable forestry and are ready, willing and able to assume our new responsibilities," said Mike Barker, spokesperson for the companies.<P>
	
The licence applicants will submit a detailed business plan including their specific goals and responsibilities for forest operations and planning activities, as well as business and financial information in support of their proposal. Once draft plans for the  Algoma and Wawa units are completed and accepted by MNR, they will form the basis for the proposed SFL.<P>

"Prior to approving an SFL on the Wawa and Algoma Management Units, MNR will want to be satisfied that existing wood commitments to the industry will continue to be met, and that the arrangements put in place for existing smaller companies and operators are fair," said Wawa  District Manager Quentin Day.<P> 

The proposed SFLs will undergo a 30-day public review. The public will be invited to participate through media notices, a public advertisement, letters to local stakeholders groups, and public meetings.<P>
