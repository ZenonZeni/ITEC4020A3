<h2>How It All Works</h2>
<p><strong>An Atomic Description of Silicon</strong>
<p><p>All matter is composed of atoms.  Atoms, in turn, are composed of positively charged protons,
negatively charged electrons, and neutral neutrons.  The protons and neutrons, which are of
approximately equal size, comprise the close-packed central "nucleus" of the atom, where almost
all of the mass of the atom is located.  The much lighter electrons orbit the nucleus at very high
velocities.  Although the atom is built from oppositely charged particles, its overall charge is
neutral because it contains an equal number of positive protons and negative electrons.

<p>The electrons orbit the nucleus at different distances, depending on their energy level; an
electron with less energy orbits close to the nucleus, whereas one of greater energy orbits farther
away.  The electrons farthest from the nucleus interact with those of neighboring atoms to
determine the way solid structures are formed.

<p>The silicon atom has 14 electrons, but their natural orbital arrangement allows only the outer
four of these to be given to, accepted from, or shared with other atoms.  These outer four
electrons, called "valence" electrons, play an important role in the photovoltaic effect.

The four electrons that orbit the nucleus in the outermost, or "valence," energy level are given to,
accepted from, or shared with other atoms.</font>
