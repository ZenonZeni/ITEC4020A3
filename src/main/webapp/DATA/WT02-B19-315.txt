Dear Conferee:<P>
On  behalf of the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC), the largest professional organization of teachers, administrators and parents who are concerned with the education of children with disabilities and/or giftedness,  I am writing ask for your support for funding for special education programs.  The House appropriations bill for FY 1996 would cut special education programs by $160 million, the Senate would cut special education programs by $7.4 million.  <B>We urge conferees to accept the lesser of two evils and support the Senate funding levels for programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).<BR>
</B><BR>
The House bill would cut $160.4 million in programs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and would wipe out funding for critical programs including: professional development, innovation and development, clearinghouses that provide information on the education of children with disabilities, early childhood education, special education technology, the regional resource centers and special studies! <P>
<B>Professional Development.</B>  With States reporting a shortage of special education teachers of more than 27,000, the need for professional development in special education has never been greater.  Every child with a disability should be educated in a school staffed by capable, well-prepared professionals.  The inclusion of more children with disabilities into the regular classroom places an additional demand on the need for quality training of our classroom teachers.  The elimination of the funding for the IDEA professional development program is short-sighted and will result in the lack of adequate training for those on the front line of education.  The Senate bill restores funding for teacher training to the FY 1995 level.  The funds for the training of teachers of special needs children should be increased, but at the very least should be frozen at the FY 1995 level.<B>  Please support special education teacher training and support the Senate funding level.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Innovation and Development and Clearinghouses.  </B> Under the House bill, funding would also be eliminated for the Innovation and Development program under IDEA.  This program supports the backbone of research in the education of children with disabilities.  This program provides new knowledge and develops improved approaches and products to better the education of children with disabilities.  As issues regarding the education of students with disabilities shift from access to education to the quality of the education provided, it becomes increasingly imperative that there be a continual investment in research and innovation activities that help teachers improve the quality of the services to children with disabilities.  Research, however, is useless without the dissemination of the information obtained.  That is why IDEA authorizes three clearinghouses to provide current, reliable information to parents, teachers, and others on the education of children with disabilities.   The clearinghouses help translate special education research into an understandable format that can be used by parents and professionals and should be funded.  The Senate cut funding for research by $6.6 million and for the clearinghouses by $173,000.  <B>We ask that the conferees fully restore the funding for these critical programs.  Without the necessary research and dissemination we will beunable to advance our knowledge of reaching and teaching children with disabilities.</B>  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Early Childhood Education. </B> The Early Childhood Education program complements the Part H Early Intervention program and the Preschool program by developing models of best practice for preschool and early intervention programs and by improving statewide program development.  The program supports demonstration, outreach and research activities to address the special needs of children aged birth through eight that have disabilities.  It is the primary mechanism for providing families, agency administrators, and service providers with information, resources, and technical assistance in early intervention and preschool education.  The House bill would eliminate funding while the Senate bill would fully restore funding for the Early Childhood Education program.<B>  We urge you to support the Senate funding level that would restore funding for this program.</B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Technology Applications.</B>  A major part of helping children with disabilities learn, is taking advantage of the current technology available to teach children with exceptional needs.  With the use of technology, children who otherwise would be unable to communicate are able to fully participate in the regular classroom.  The research and design of new technology to serve children with disabilities is of critical importance not only to future children who will benefit, but also to society who will benefit from their ability to communicate.   This is a program where a modest federal investment can make a substantial difference in the lives of children with disabilities.  The House would eliminate all funding for this program while the Senate would cut $869,000.<B>  Please fully restore funds to the IDEA technology program.       </B><BR>
<BR>
<B>Javits Gifted Program.</B>  Also cut in both the House and Senate bills is the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act,  the only federal program designed specifically to address the education of gifted and talented children.  The Javits gifted program demonstration projects also allow new ideas, practices, and services to be field-tested.  These practical, real-world tests are critical in improving practices and understanding of gifted children.  The National Center for Research and Development in the Education of Gifted and Talented Children and Youth, also funded through the Javits program, provides invaluable information on gifted education to local communities.  Cut to a FY 1996 level of $3 million in both bills, the Javits gifted program will be devastated by these cuts.<B>  We ask that the conferees restore the cuts in the Javits program to the pre-recission FY 1994 level of $9.5 million.</B><P>
The House bill would also eliminate funding for IDEA Special Studies and the Regional Resource Centers, while the Senate would cut funding.  Please support the higher level of funding in the Senate bill.<P>
<B>We urge conferees on the Appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Education to support special education programs.  It is not enough to split the difference between the House and the Senate bills on these important programs.  IDEA authorities help to train teachers of children with disabilities, provide support for crucial research in educating children with special needs and enable the dissemination of critical material.  We ask that Congress support our continuing progress in addressing the needs of children with disabilities and fully restore funding to special education <P>
Sincerely, <P>
<BR>
