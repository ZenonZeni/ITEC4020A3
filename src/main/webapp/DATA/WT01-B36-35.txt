<h4>CHAPTER SIX</h4>

<h3>LONDON ON MY MIND</h3>
</center>

<hr width="50%">

<h4>London 1965</h4>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is always interesting to come back to London
(why do we love the places we are born in ?) and see how you
react to the people. Here I am no longer 'the traveller', but a
resident, which is something you realise the moment you step
outside Heathrow&#151;abroad, you can treat the outer world as
mere reaction; at home this is impossible. When an Englishman
looks at London he is seeing in its masonry the reflection of his
race, like a clean slate, with his own face on. He may not like
what he sees, but it is a place he may nod to and really feel he
knows. Here, then, I am at the mercy of my own particular form of
existence; here I am responsible in a definite way, just a
citizen like everybody else.... <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I exchanged the consciousness of
Millbrook as rapidly as possible for that of the resident.
Through the far-sight of a generous friend, I soon became the
lease-holder of a large, comfortable, Pont Street, Belgravia
flat, with high ceilings and thick walls. It was here that we
opened the WPC ('World Psychedelic Centre') with Desmond O'Brien,
a Lloyd's underwriter and Etonian, as President; and, later, Joey
Mellen, also ex-Eton and a graduate in law from Oxford, as its
Vice-President. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I had brought with me from America a quantity of
LSD, about half a gram, or enough for 5000 sessions, part of an
experimental batch made available by courtesy of the Czech
Government laboratories in Prague, who had taken over as
suppliers after Sandoz stopped selling it anymore, that is, after
the Leary-Alpert Harvard storm. But as far as Britain was
concerned, there were as yet no provisions for LSD <i>et al</i>.
under the 'Dangerous Drugs' Act. The possession of this drug did
not become an offense until the summer of 1966, when Britain fell
in line with American legislation in this matter. But it was
through this loophole in the 1965 legal situation that the WPC
was able to operate in an open way&#151;though we had to watch
anything else, particularly hash, for which we could be busted
(and eventually were, just five months after we started). But for
the time being, and encouraged by the accelerating interest in
psychedelics amongst our Chelsea neighbours, we believed that
London would indeed become the centre for a world psychedelic
movement. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In a city where world-feeling is expressed in the
form of an impulse for empirical expansion, our 'message' was
simple: If you can't capture the world, then try to conquer the
heavens. For the idealism of the <i>conquistador</i> would be
changed to that of the mystic, the man who conquers nobody except
himself. 'The energy which, a little while ago, was able to fill
universal space is now condensed into the confines of the
individual self; for isn't it said that what is without, is also
within ? It is just that the eye of insight&#151;the eye that
&quot;gets in&quot; where reality &quot;gets out&quot;&#151;has
atrophied in man during the past few thousand years; man is blind
to the world inside himself and needs the help of <i>three</i>
eyes instead of two to gain true wisdom of his own
individuality.' We wrote it; we may even have believed it
sometimes: and 'acid is to help us see &#133; '. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now we could believe with Camus that 'real
generosity towards the future lies in giving all to the present'.
And since it happens so rarely in a lifetime that one ever gets
the chance to give one's <i>all</i> to something, or someone, we
felt a tremendous sense of involvement now that we had pledged
ourselves to spread the psychedelic doctrine. And in one of our
earliest manifestos, we wrote </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Man's vision of the future is his recreation&#151;the
    fulfillment of it is his procreation. The essential ritual is
    procreation&#151;creation. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The future is what man thinks up in the
    present&#151;the logical extension in all cycles of thought
    of the point of each revelation&#151;the illumination of
    darkness by the word. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; 'In the dawn of a new evolutionary phase poets
    chirp like sparrows....disregarded&#151;like
    sparrows&#151;the poets keep singing of a vision which is
    theirs <i>pour encourager les autres.... '</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the nagging question in such matters was how
were we going to communicate this message with the rest of the
world? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Some of us had began to wonder if the solution did
not lie in the direction first suggested by William Burroughs (in
1961): 'The forward step must be made in silence. We catch
ourselves from word forms&#151;this can be accomplished by
substituting for words letters, concepts and verbal concepts,
other modes of expression: for example, colour.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And silence is golden for those who live in the
land of gold. But from the revolutionists' point of view, the
huge monopolies of power and influence could be seen in 1964 to
have become places synonymous with intellectual bankruptcy and
spiritual (religious) emptiness. To take one example, the
situation with regard to the University Establishment. They could
be seen to be institutions of intellectual servitude: 'Students
have been systematically dehumanised, deemed incompetent to
regulate their own lives, sexually, politically and academically.
They are treated like commodities with a price-tag, so much raw
material to be processed for the university's
clients&#151;business, government and military bureaucracies.
Teachers have been relegated to the position of
servant-intellectuals, required, for regular promotion, to
propagate points of view in harmony with the military and
industrial leadership of our society.' <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The silence of responsible opinion in the face of
such calls to integrity, and ultimately even to sanity itself,
all but amounted to a scandal; and certainly a scandal wider in
its implications than any freedom movement growing up around
psychedelic drug-use, which the mass media promptly called
'abuse', and saw LSD made into a 'dirty' word, like masturbation
or VD. We couldn't simply bundle the drugs into a bag and bury
it, hoping psychedelics could all somehow be forgotten. This was
the problem&#151;what do we do with these psychedelics now that
'we' in the sense of <i>Everyman</i> have them ? <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was&#151;and is&#151;a bit extraordinary, in
Britain of all places, that LSD has been rarely a subject, and
even more rarely a successful subject, for our best thinkers
(with such notable exceptions as Robert Graves on the subject of
'mushroom' visionary experience, Aldous Huxley, and Gerald Heard,
all of whom, perhaps significantly, lived abroad). <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The reality of the LSD world was too random and
fragmentary for any but the most mentally flexible to identify
with it, and the unemotional 'cop-out'&#151;<i>synthesis</i>&#151;was
impossible. British intellectuals were not going to confuse the
LSD experience with <i>their</i> literary
'stream-of-consciousness' techniques for discovering the truth
about processes of deep consciousness, either&#151;you would
hardly call Tom Wolfe or James Joyce an 'acid tripper'! What they
were unwilling, or unable, to see was that acid literature and
acid thoughts are really only those ideas that deal with <i>high
level revelation, mysticism, telepathy, and transcendence of the
ego</i>. And to that extent we were a new human game and had a
message of universal interest. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The developing cult of Exploring Inwardness had
become a new truth, the stable core around which a new radical
movement would evolve. Truth and response are not a private
affair, for the truth comes to one man for all men, endowing the
recipient of it in his relation to his contemporaries with the
authority of the Prophet or of the High Priest. But men do not
willingly recognise a new voice that cries from the modern
wilderness &#133; and if they are ever at a loss for a scapegoat,
they have their man in him who would seek to remove the
distorting web of Maya, the cause of all illusions in the self. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Martin Buber, and a prophet of our time, reminds us
that, according to Hasidim, the 'teller of tales', ' &#133; the
effective exploration of the heart is the beginning of the way in
a man's life,' it is the one journey in which 'each man must find
his own way for himself'. Or such were my esoteric influences in
this period, which fed my vision of a future happier world &#133;
</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thirteen cartons of books arrived at Pont Street
via the S.S. <i>Samaria</i> from America, a private importation
for which H.M. Customs required a Bill of Lading and a completed
form C.3. (Now you can't get more accurate than that). This was
our 'psychedelic stock' for this 'Operation London'&#151;300
copies of the Leary/Alpert/Metzner <i>The Psychedelic Experience:
A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead,</i> 200 issues of
<i>The Psychedelic Review</i> ed. by Drs. Weil and Metzner, and
200 copies of <i>The Psychedelic Reader</i> ed. by Gunther Weil.
It was not only that, at this time, in 1965, there was nothing
similar originating in Britain, but such literature was virtually
unobtainable here, except possibly through Bernard at Turret
Books in Kensington. It also meant that we had a Manual for
running 'guided' LSD-sessions through which we could observe the
elaboration of 'the Art' as well as various new art-forms. Now we
could conduct intensive group-sessions in which the group-mind
might participate in an ancient Tibetan ritual, and in the safety
of our own homes. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; All that now remained was an opportunity to use
them, which soon presented itself on the night of the first Full
Moon. (Alas, for those who do not actually <i>feel</i> the
biogenetic vibrations of a Full Moon, it must seem no more than a
pathetic, paltry, 'astronomical' phenomenon.) But for the tiny
circle of participants who asked to take part in an experience on
the <i>Bardo</i> plane, it was a night to hear mysteries which
quicken the heart, the mysterious power that makes all things new
again &#133; <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were twelve of us on this spacetrip. We saw
ourselves as voyagers in search of answers to the secret of
magical self-liberation. In Tibet the responsible institution is,
or used to be, the College of Magic Ritual. Since it was
obviously impossible to duplicate any of this, we structured the
decor of the large living-room along the lines of <i>Sutra 19</i>
from the great esoteric work, the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> &#133; soon
the front room was emptied of all furnishings, except the carpet,
and we tried to have around simple, natural things to contact
during this session&#151; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>hand-woven cloth <br>
    uncarved wood<br>
    flowers&#151;growing things <br>
    ancient music<br>
    burning fire<br>
    a touch of earth <br>
    a splash of water <br>
    fruit, good bread, cheese <br>
    fermenting wine<br>
    candlelight<br>
    temple incense <br>
    a warm hand<br>
    fish swimming <br>
    anything which is over 500 years old. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We also had lots of cushions, some excellent tapes
and hi-fi equipment, a slide projector, and several chillums. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; We began shortly before midnight, moving into the
new temple room with a kind of piety and seriousness you find in
acts of faith, when we all took our place in the 'Magic Circle of
Liberation'. After a short silence, we passed round the bowl
containing grapes impregnated with acid&#151;about 300
micrograms, or what is considered to be a relatively high dosage,
likely to last from between eight to twelve hours&#151;the
sympathetic discharge would follow in about forty minutes,
indicated by enlarged pupil diameter, rise in body temperature,
increased heart-rate, variable blood pressure, and sometimes a
moderate amount of physical trembling. Yet they are no stronger
on the body than the effects of a game of tennis&#151;only
thinking makes them so. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; During this first period, the period of
'countdown', when the psychic energy first begins to be felt,
there is a growing sensation within of thousands of delicate
threads moving about the body, subtle lines of force which
tremble like Pampas grass, as if some thing had opened inside and
they were all streaming out. It is as though one's body is
dissolving and floating away, and the 'essence' of Me was being
liberated to join the 'essence' of everything else about me. One
feels open to a total flow, over and around and within the body,
and one becomes more and more conscious of these threads of
energy, of their vibrations, like harpstrings giving forth their
individual tones. There is something purely physical about it, a
sensation, something felt rather than recognised, a matter for
intuition, not intellect. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This sensation lasts for perhaps ten to fifteen
minutes (though one is hardly conscious of the passing of time).
Then the threads seem to collect themselves into a single vibrant
strand, circular, coiled like a snake; and then like a snake it
slowly begins to unwind, moving almost imperceptibly up the
spine, which feels like a hollow tube, gathering in force and
intensity and bathing the body in a silvery light and very, very
sensual indeed. And one's pale introspective self sits in the
boon of these tingling strings, sensitive to the least vibration
beyond time, beyond place, rocking to the motion of all that
is.... The dominant impression is that of entering into the very
marrow of self &#133; as if each of the billion atoms which
compose the body under normal circumstances is summarised and
averaged into crude, discriminate wholesale impressions which are
now able to be seen and savoured for itself. The impressions
become more intense. The vibrations turn into
colours&#151;brilliant blues, purples, and greens with dashes of
red and streaks of yellow-orange. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; One gradually becomes aware of movement, a rocking
type of movement, like on the crest of a wave, yet the body does
not move at all &#133; with an overwhelming acceleration one is
turning around and around, swirling, then shuttling back and
forth like a piece of potassium on water, hissing, sparkling,
full of life and fire. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; This experience may be likened to an
emotional-reflective visual kaleidoscope &#133; experiences
involving these three components keep dissolving continuously
from one pattern to another. Emotionally the patterns ranged from
serene contentment and mild euphoria to apprehension which
bordered on, but never quite slipped into, alarm. But
overwhelmingly they involved (a) astonishment at the absolutely
incredible immensity, complexity, intensity and extravagance of
being, existence, the cosmos, call it what you will; (b) the most
acute sense of the poignancy, fragility, preciousness, and
significance of all life and history. The latter is accompanied
by a powerful sense of the responsibility of all for all &#133;
intense affection for the others in the room &#133; importance
and rightness of behaving decently and responsibly&#151;of trying
to remain 'open' and cool in all areas simultaneously. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; As the 'guide' for this first <i>Bardo</i> session,
my job was to look after the music, the pre-recorded taped
messages from the book, and keep the participants in the flow.
The set and setting are positive, supportive, anxiety-free so
that the reaction will be ecstatic, insightful, and educational,
just as when the set and setting are clinical, experimental,
non-supportive, and impersonal, the reactions are invariably
frightening and confusing. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Thus, <br>
    In the greatest sessions<br>
    One does not know that<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; there is a guide<br>
    In the next best sessions<br>
    One praises the guide<br>
    In the good session<br>
    One admires the guide<br>
    It is worse when<br>
    One fears the guide<br>
    The worst is that one pays him<br>
    If the guide lacks trust<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; in the people<br>
    Then<br>
    The trust of the people<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; will be lacking<br>
    The wise guide guards his words<br>
    The wise guide sits serenely,<br>
    When the greatest session is over<br>
    The people will say&#151;<br>
    &quot;It all happened naturally&quot;<br>
    Or<br>
    &quot;It was so simple, we did it<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; all ourselves&quot;.'<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Adapted from <i>Tao
    Sutra 17,</i> by Timothy Leary) </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly after dropping the acid, I played a tape of
Buddhist <i>Cakra</i> music, followed by <i>Concert Percussion</i>
by the American composer, John Cage. I then read from the
Psychedelic manual: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'O voyager<br>
    The time has come for you to seek new levels of reality. Your<br>
    ego and identity are about to cease. You are about to be set
    face<br>
    to face with the Clear Light of the Void. You are about to
    experience<br>
    it in its reality. In the ego-free state, wherein all things
    are<br>
    like the void and cloudless sky and the naked spotless
    intellect<br>
    is like a transparent vacuum; at this moment, know yourself
    and<br>
    abide in that state.<br>
    O voyager<br>
    That which is called ego death is coming to you. <br>
    Remember:<br>
    This is now the hour of death and rebirth; <br>
    take advantage of this temporary death to obtain the perfect
    state;<br>
    Enlightenment .<br>
    Concentrate on the unity of all living beings. <br>
    Hold on to the Clear Light.<br>
    Use it to attain understanding and love.<br>
    If you cannot maintain the bliss of illumination and if you
    are slipping back into contact with the external world,<br>
    Remember:<br>
    The hallucinations which you may now experience, the visions
    and insights,<br>
    will teach you much about yourself and the world.<br>
    The veil of routine perception will be torn from your eyes. <br>
    Remember the unity of all living things.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; About one hour had passed since we ingested the
drug, and we were well into the first <i>Bardo.</i> We were
beginning to confront the awesome illumination of the
metaphysical void and new energy transformations. The
instructions from the manual acted as necessary guideposts. We
were learning how to spin in neurological space. Psychedelic
equals mind-opening consciousness. Psychedelic means ecstatic,
which is to stand outside our normal patterns. It means going out
of your mind, your habitual world of contingencies, space-time
coordinates. And the key issue: 'Anything that exists outside
exists there inside'. The human brain is analogous to the
galactic one&#151;there are some ten to thirteen billion cells in
the brain, about the same number as there are stars in the
universe where the planet earth is invisible. The problem of
consciousness-expansion is the same as the external inertia to
get off this planet. The brain is 'hooked' to the external world.
Put a person into a sensory-deprivation tank for very long and he
is overcome by 'withdrawal' symptoms&#151;anxiety, tension,
physical discomfort, and paranoia. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Next I played some music by Ravi Shankar and some
bossanova. Interval of fifteen minutes. Then some music by
Scriabin and part of a Bach cello suite. Interval. Some Debussy,
and Indian flute music by Ghosh. Interval. Bach organ music and
some John Cage 'space' music. Interval. The Ali Brothers and
Japanese flute music. We also looked at slides projected on to
the ceiling Tantric yantras, Vedic Gods, the Buddha, Tibetan
mandalas. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I suppose that the room in which we had gathered
would appear eccentric to most modern minds&#151;candlelight,
flames, incense, drapes flowers, bowls of fruit, but to us it all
seemed harmonious, natural and very appropriate for the
experiences we were undergoing. The session was not to be thought
of as some kind of show, a piece of theatre, an entertainment,
but a demonstration and a sharing of novel energy levels and
unusual forms of perception. And the decor was to assist the
voyager in his experience, a sort of ABC of internal language. It
was a device to help one go outside routine modes of
experiencing, beyond learned or familiar concepts, so that one
was&#151;albeit briefly&#151;no longer aware of oneself as a
social figure, but as another entity. We stood outside the
familiar self, outside parochial worlds of experience, outside
London outside the idea of being English/American/Danish. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this sense, the psychedelic experience was not
something invented by the Sandoz Chemical Company, but has been
known since Vedic times and for which an enormous literature
exists. In the West we seek to explain mind in terms of a science
called psychology, which is externally oriented towards action
and behaviours. But here one faced the fact that in the last
analysis <i>everything</i> is internal, everything happens in
your own mind. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'O friend <br>
    You may experience ego-transcendence, <br>
    Departure from your old self. <br>
    Do not cling in fondness and weakness to your old self. <br>
    Even though you cling to your mind, <br>
    you have lost the power to keep it. <br>
    You gain nothing by struggling in this hallucinatory world. <br>
    Be not attached. <br>
    Be not weak. <br>
    Go forward. <br>
    Relax. <br>
    Merge yourself with them. <br>
    Blissfully accept the wonders of your own making.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; There were still the instructions of the Third
Bardo to follow, and crucial to this session, because they gave
instructions on how to re-enter one's normal state of
consciousness and thus the everyday world &#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'O Voyager,<br>
    Now, if you wish to see the truth,<br>
    Your mind must rest without distraction. <br>
    There is nothing to do, nothing to think. <br>
    Recognise that this is the period of re-entry into the normal
    world.<br>
    Do not struggle to re-enter the denser atmosphere of routine
    game<br>
    existence. Do not attempt to use force or will-power. <br>
    Do not hold on to thoughts.<br>
    Allow the mind to rest in its unmodified state. <br>
    Meditate on the oneness of all energy.<br>
    Do not struggle to explain. Trust your guide.<br>
    Trust your companions. Trust the compassionate Buddha, <br>
    and meditate calmly and without<br>
    distraction.<br>
    Do not struggle to return. The re-entry will happen by
    itself.<br>
    Recognise where you are.<br>
    Recognition will lead to liberation.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Recognition, in this sense, does not lead to
liberation, but is liberation. He who really knows (that is to
say, vitally, not merely theoretically, with his intelligence)
that he is one with the entire universe, is beyond all fetters by
virtue of this knowledge. The world no longer binds him to it;
because, having once been above or outside ordinary existence, he
sees the things of the world differently, from a different point
of view, and they no longer possess the same power over him. This
'seeing differently' means at the same time recognition;
recognition, therefore, does not only condition, but is,
liberation. In his deepest being man is spirit, and the more he
recognises this, the more firmly he believes it, the more chains
fall away from him. Thus, it could happen that, in accordance
with the teachings of the Bardo Thodol, complete recognition
overcomes even death. All it needs is a believing soul, which is
what is meant when we talk about the power of faith. Ordinary
people will only be able to believe when they are convinced
simultaneously that the content of their faith is also
objectively real: that Krishna was really an Avatar, that the
Bible is really the Word of God, that Christ saved humanity from
death in the historical sense. The visionary, on the other hand,
knows that faith in the religious sense, and believing-to-be-true
in the scientific one, have nothing in common with each other,
that religiously it is completely indifferent whether Christ
existed or not, and that the true visionary who is spiritualized,
employs faith as he would an instrument. Ramakrishna, for
instance, was, for a while, a Christian and also a Mussulman; he
wanted to know the effect of these ideals; and in the meantime
his faith was so strong that Mahomet as well as Jesus appeared to
him in the spirit. For the rest, he kept to the worship of Kali,
the heavenly mother, as being the cult best suited to his nature,
for he knew that no one form was intrinsically adequate to
divinity. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In the session we have just considered, it was
collaborative, and the planning increased the likelihood that
each person would have the sort of experience he wished. Thus his
internal freedom, his control over his consciousness is
increased. The readings from the <i>Tibetan Manual</i> were to
bring about 'recognition'; that is to remind the voyager at the
moment of ego-loss that he is prepared; to insure that he will
flow with the process trustfully. While the Buddhist language may
strike the Westerner as 'far-out', keep in mind that this is only
one of many manuals and instruction sequences from which the
prospective voyager can choose, and that the esoteric quality of
the language serves as a mnemonic device, that is, say, a sharp
memory tap so that the former instructions and resolutions can be
recalled. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; If we agree that the human mind was born free but
everywhere it is in chains, it will take a miracle to free it:
because the chains are magical in the first place. We are in
bondage to authority outside ourselves; and to exorcise these
chains is the great work of magical self-liberation. And the one
way of doing this is to activate the soul. Then the eyes of the
spirit would become one with the eyes of the body, and god would
be in us, not outside. God in us: <i>entheos</i>&#151;enthusiasm:
this is the essence of the psychedelic experience. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And how, you may wonder, shall we recognise the
individual who has thus freed himself from the bonds of
appearances, the man who has liberated himself and now walks the
earth? </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'He who returns in the flow of spirituality <br>
    Brings back a mysterious penetration <br>
    So subtle <br>

    &nbsp; &nbsp; Floating high like a gull <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfathomable like muddy water<br>
    How can we fathom his muddiness ?<br>
    Water becomes clear through stillness<br>
    How can we become still ?<br>
    By moving with the stream.' </p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Again and again I must think of these verses from
the <i>Tao Te Ching,</i> for they remind me of so many of the
hippie voyagers I meet on the trail, who live at a different
level as the result of extraordinary internal experiences, which
alone affect men. With Jesus, they can say: I have, like my
father, all life within me. </p>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The <i>milieu</i> of 'swinging London' in 1965
appeared to me like the best possible caricature of the Edwardian
world, that mighty institute for the threefold passion of
independence, indulgence, indifference, which gave soul to their
esprit and their art of living. Real love was unknown to them,
they had no serious interests of any kind- the whole of their
existence was spent in grooving, getting high, making the scene.
And yet many of them were intelligent and profound and their
profundity was not impeded by their life-style; on the contrary,
it gave them a means of expression. And for this reason the
frivolity of this period occasionally gave an impression of
gravity and profundity which struck me as being strange and made
one dream.... It was a period when people paid attention to
dress, and clothes were no less essential than their
bodies&#151;it was a means of expression, and their dressed
condition mirrored in their consciousness the outer expression
for themselves. 'By changing his clothes he changes the man
within.' The mode of dress assisted in expressing certain traits
of his being. In this way the process of dressing-up can not only
heighten or lessen the individual's power of expression: it can
indeed bring about self-realisation. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; How did I come to make this observation ? Shortly
after I moved into the Pont Street apartment, a couple of my
friends took me aside and suggested that I get some new clothes,
costumes of the Chelsea of the mid-sixties&#151;Edwardian
jackets, embroidered in gold and silver, and silk shirts with
huge collars, velvet pants and blue suede shoes, and so
forth&#151;and thereby prove that the spirit of this age is the
spirit of its wearer. It was a method of clothing oneself with a
certain purpose&#151;expressing certain traits of one's being
which in the ordinary course of events remain in the background.
It is a mode of dress to reveal what the individual is; it
alters, as it were, the centre of his being. Such an individual,
they argued, is more himself than he is otherwise in his 'real'
existence. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Accordingly, I let myself be persuaded to exchange
my jeans and sweat shirt for a new wardrobe, and Michael Rainey's
shop 'Hung On You' sent round a huge pile of fashionable clothes
and a bill for £600. There were about five of us staying at the
apartment and we divided the clothes between us. I ended up with
a pair of flared pin-stripe trousers with an enormous belt and
silver buckle, several silk shirts and ties, and a couple of
hand-embroidered jackets. Now I was at one with the fashion of my
times. The only problem was a psychological one&#151;I was
embarrassed to be seen in them and consequently I stayed indoors,
ignoring all invitations and gradually reverted back to my jeans
and sweat shirt much to the chagrin of those for whom clothes had
great significance. There was also the additional factor of the
cheque, which bounced, and I felt somehow uncomfortable wearing
these expensive clothes as a result. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; My associations in this period with a select group
of young aristocrats and artists and musicians and writers,
responsible for influencing sharply the patterns of the New
Vanguard of British culture and intellectual life, was felicitous
in the extreme; but it cannot be held solely responsible for
making a revolutionary of me. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; l was certainly surrounded by a number of
high-powered anarchists. My partner, Desmond O'Brien, was already
achieving renown as one of the most far-out LSD exponents in
London and had ever been described in one publication as 'Mr.
LSD'; and our Vice-President, Joey Mellen, one of the first
persons to trepan himself, had already embarked on a career as a
priest in a new order which was to make him a distinguished
figure of great importance to English evolutionary religion. In
addition to my colleagues, associates of the World Psychedelic
Centre included such notables as Victor Lownes, who co-founded
the Playboy empire with Hugh Heffner; Julian Ormsby-Gore, the
film maker; Alex Trocchi, the philosopher-writer; Michael
O'Dwyer, the art gallery owner; Julie Felix, the singer; George
Andrews, the poet; Jo Berke, the psychiatrist working with Ronnie
Laing- Feliks Topolski, the painter; John Hopkins, the writer;
Nick Douglas, the painter; Kim Ella, the singer; Ian Sommerville,
the multi-media expert; Roman Polanski, the film maker; Bart
Hughes, the high priest of the trepanation movement; Sir Roland
Penrose, a director of the Tate Gallery; Hugh Blackwell, the
writer; as well as Roger Lewis, Billy Bolitho, Virginia Lyon,
Steve Groff, Mark Warman, Olivia de Haulleville, Shelley Cholst,
Maggie Russell, Shirley Scott James, Bill Burroughs, Bobby
Davidson, Donovan, Paul McCartney, Jim Arender, John Eason,
Nicholas Gormanstone, Christopher Gibbs, Suna Portman, and
Victoria Ormsby-Gore, all of whom made outstanding contributions
to the current London scene. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; They exemplified a constellation of attitudes that
were of great importance to the cultural-artistic life of London.
They represented perhaps the seminal non-conformism of England's
mid-sixties intelligentsia&#151;not the evangelical
non-conformism of such as the Millbrook sect, but an
intellectualized form of psychedelic enlightenment, of which
popularised Learyism was largely a culmination&#151;that freed so
many of England's educated people from the rigidity of social and
class and cultural patterns which had outwardly been solidifying
into right-wing Toryism. Their rebellion was typical of this
period; the Establishment was the enemy, the representative of
the rigid patterns they felt needed to be violently rearranged. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; These exotic friends were supplemented through
their contacts; and affiliations developed with such places as
St. Martin's School of Art, the Institute of Contemporary Arts,
where we conducted a 'Workshop in Consciousness Expansion', and
such literary figures as Professor Neville Coghill, Norman
Mailer, and Philip O'Connor. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And yet &#133; there was a problem, a
self-indulgence of mine which earned me some social suspicion, if
not also social ostracism, and which led me&#151;though against
all my instincts&#151;well over that line which divides the
normal from the abnormal. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I refer, of course, only to my taking of
methedrine. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was not illegal to take methedrine, provided
that one has a prescription, signed by a registered medical
practitioner; and one could legally receive regular supplies of
this (or any other 'hard' narcotic) drug, provided that the
physician prescribes for an 'addiction'. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In 1965, not only was my purchase of methedrine
legal: friends bought their heroin and their cocaine with no more
trouble than that with which they purchased their cough syrup. I
took my methedrine in the 'pure' form, as a liquid, being the
form in which the drug is most easily assimilable. And in doses
that medical descriptions of the typical methedrine-addiction
syndrome indicate to have been heavy ones, about seven injections
a day. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But that I had a serious addiction, a description
of my nervous activity makes clear: the restlessness, the ability
to work for days without adequate sleep, and even without rest at
all; the abrupt changes of mood; and the equally abrupt collapse
into somnolence not far (if at all) removed from a torpor
bordering on coma these, to those who have studied the effects of
methedrine addiction, are the unmistakable evidence of heavy and
prolonged indulgence in a powerful narcotic. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I also smoked pot and hashish constantly, and tried
every chemical I was handed. I also took acid about three times a
week and in dosages in excess of 500 micrograms. I never slept,
and after about two months I had turned myself into a sort of
zombie. Every now and then I injected myself with
dimethyl-tryptamine&#151;a fast-acting psychedelic of short
duration&#151;to jack myself back into life again. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Naturally, this 'hard' drug-taking led to a
complete disorientation of my life, which was now chaotic in the
extreme, and I spiralled further and further down until I was
caught in a mental prison of anxieties, paranoia, frictions and
most despairs of consequence. It was all very, very frightening,
and I began to think that I would remain forever hung up on an
endless chain of manic-depressive emotions. It was ironic,
really, that after all those lessons in meditation, all those
disciplines and yogic exercises those trips under LSD, those
austerities and years of metaphysical reflection, the mystic
dreams, quiet days, the idea that there was no need to <i>achieve</i>
anymore or to go about and do things and make things happen, I
was now at the mercy of a non-miraculous addiction. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In vain I tried to kick the habit, but it was
impossible, the monkey was on my back and I could not remove it.
I began to believe that it was all somehow a cosmic plot in which
I was the victim. I had nightmares which nearly scared me to
death. I reached a point where communication with other people
was impossible. I saw the whole world conspiring against me. I
was literally out of my mind and living in some kind of hell of
my own making. And, worst of all, there was no one I could turn
to for help, for there was no one I trusted; such were the
effects of this poison I injected into myself. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the situation at Pont Street became more and
more unreal so much so that all my friends stopped coming round
and everyone thought I was crazy, which I was, if my behaviour
was anything to go by. That is how I appeared to them, what I was
for them&#151;a stupid, insensitive, unthinking person. What this
drug had done was to reveal the hidden monstrousness and infernal
depths within my psyche. Certainly, I made conscious efforts to
exorcise the sources of my confusion, but in vain. How would I
ever rid myself of this methedrine hell, this habit which was
killing me? I had plunged into the abyss, gone beyond my
limitations, beyond even the confines of my reason which had
served me so well. This was the land of madness, of death. How
undignified, despicable, meaningless! <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Yet, like all addicts, I clung to my drug. I had
grown accustomed to it, I had even formed a superstitious
affection for it. I didn't want to stop my habit. One fix meant
four more hours of life another fix, four more hours of life. I
couldn't just let myself go, for this would have meant death, and
I still clung stubbornly to life. But there was a sense in which
I was already dead. The taking of methedrine implies excess of
life, intemperance, and surfeit; it is also a way of killing
yourself. This realisation accounted for the uncontrollable
terror, the panic, which gripped my soul at nightfall, when I was
alone with the alone and lost in a maze of contradictory
emotions, when I knew that my addiction was at once tragic,
dangerous, terrifying and immoral. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I was not the only one who thought so. George
Andrews, obviously disturbed by what was happening, wrote me a
letter: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Dear Michael, I have been hearing some strange stories
    about you from a lot of different people. In Tangier I
    learned to draw a very sharp line of distinction between the
    psychedelic guide, who is rare, and the psychedelic hustler,
    who is a dime a dozen. For someone with as much experience as
    you have had, to be using it the way you seem to be, you have
    in your hands the Void in crystal form, the lightning of the
    gods, the jade wine of the immortals. All the flip-outs and
    bad trips one is responsible for are added to one's daily
    load of <i>karma</i>. Why make the load even heavier? Why not
    lighten it instead?' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; But the advice could not be heeded. Like a poison
gas, the methedrine had become all-invading, and I knew that I
was close to death. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I ought to have known better. What a situation to
be in! The euphoria of the drug had become my refuge from the
real world. It was a barrier between myself and other people, a
wailing wall, a wall of separation. And I wondered what would
become of me. Was I a helpless puppet in the hands of some
unimaginably cruel demon, tugged and pulled on invisible strings,
but off from myself, since my innermost being was no longer in
control. What was the use of knowing mystical truths ? What help
were they now ? That I had to stop injecting toxins into my body
was obvious enough. But how must I do this? Never have I, the
wanderer, felt such pains of anguish in my soul. It seemed to me
at times as though the demon methedrine was at hand to strip my
mind of all reason. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I was in the depths of despair, and anguish. Where
I should be laughing and playing, I felt horror and disgust. And
I did not understand how I had got myself into such a situation,
how my addiction was possible. The demon laughs: what is there to
understand ? It is something to like and enjoy. It is a matter of
course ! Is this the secret?&#151;I felt as though in some
mysterious manner, in some indescribable sense, I was living in a
plastic world where there was neither light nor fertility nor, on
the other hand, any wish to understand my former research after
truth. The spiritual light was extinguished in the same sudden
and mysterious way as it flashed up. The old dregs filled me up,
took me to task, threatened to weigh me down; I felt my humanity
as something alien, burdensome; worse still than that of the
helpless animal in a trap, because I knew how to question the
validity of that which was beyond my power to control. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It was an impossible situation. It would never have
occurred to me a few years ago, when I first started to extend my
sensory appreciations and nervous system, that one day I should
find myself sitting in the living-room of a Belgravia apartment
trying to inject myself with 'speed'; or that if by some freaky
accident such a bizarre experience had come my way I should wish
to write about it. (Still less that my publisher would condone
such an eccentric choice of subject.) But the relation of the
individual fettered to earth through addiction with the
individual who knows the light of Brahma or Jesus or Buddha,
resembles that of the ant with the human being who crosses its
path: no matter how certain the ant is by instinct, it cannot
help itself when faced by problems which must appear
transcendental to its organism. Just so in the case of the addict
who attempts to solve the riddle of his own addition. From the
angle of reason, it is insoluble. 'Don't you see?' says a
well-intentioned friend. 'Just look at the mess you are making of
your life ! Stop ! Understand ! &#133; ' How can an addict
understand ? And even if he wants to give it up, he cannot do so.
The intentions he calls forth turn back, thoughts take flight, he
cannot grasp the totality of the experience, he is afraid of
exploding into a million bits of protoplasm. So he continues. And
to ask a psychiatrist or the local vicar to cope with your
addiction is as senseless as to ask an Indian yogi to repair a
jet aircraft. Today, neither psychiatry nor religion have much to
offer in the way of comfort or cure. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hugh, a friend of mine, also shooting speed,
came round to see me. He was desperately seeking to reassure
himself that there was some meaning to his life and that this
drug could help him find it. He had been up for the last three
nights writing his 'Journal' in which he attempted to solve the
riddle of the universe, seeing in his crazed eye previously
invisible relations and connections between words and worlds, and
himself as the sun-like source of boundless energy, ceaselessly
giving, ceaselessly pouring out words without hindrance or
resistance. He showed me a few pages from his never-ending
work-in-progress &#133; </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'Aquamarine light smoke the slow drift and eddy of youth
    in blue jeans and a painted face&#151;sounds like chandeliers
    drip glitter and tinkle chime pagodas&#151;Pont Street and
    Sunny South Ken sweet sounds of Donovan on a pyramid of
    people spotlit in a flurry of congas&#151;the black saint
    dressed in tribal white moans blues and mike yells lights
    hurt by the finger gleams of lunatic heads creating a collage
    of movement&#151;HEY BABY WHAT IS THIS ?&#151;it happens in
    murmurs and purple planes of light in mauve rhythms in slow
    syncopated tinsel quivers and glitters in their
    eyes&#151;blond hair&#151;stripes and fragrance <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Drugs, man ? <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sure <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Likewise &#133; </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; It all made coherent sense to me when he read it
aloud, but I include it now as an illustration really of the
random processes of thought which occur in states of methedrine
narcosis. It was also fortunate for Hugh's reputation that, as
popular prejudice against speed began to grow&#151;and the law
began to take cognizance of that prejudice&#151;Hugh was steadily
being weaned from his habit by the undemonstrative, patient and
assiduous attentions of his girlfriend. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In my case, three events occurred to shake me out
of any feelings of indifference. The first was a telephone call
from Texas telling me that Leary had been found guilty of
transporting three ounces of marijuana across the Laredo-Mexican
border as well as failing to pay taxes on it and had been fined
$40,000 and given the maximum sentence of thirty years in jail.
'That s the same what Prometheus got,' the lawyer added, somewhat
casually. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; The second was a half-page advertisement in the
London <i>Evening Standard:</i> </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'LSD&#151;THE DRUG THAT COULD THREATEN LONDON. Just for
    kicks, some famous artists, pop stars, and debs are
    &quot;taking a trip&quot; on LSD&#151;one of the most
    powerful and dangerous drugs known to man. It produces
    hallucinations. It can cause temporary insanity. Kicks like
    this may be bought at the appalling cost of psychotic illness
    or even suicide. It is banned in America and
    elsewhere&#151;but is still available in London, quite
    legally. Still more appalling&#151;just half an ounce of LSD
    could knock out London. Socially, the stuff is dynamite. <i>London
    Life</i> magazine has investigated LSD fully and has
    uncovered a social peril of magnitude which it believes
    demands immediate legislation &#133; to stop the spread of a
    cult which could bring mental lethargy and chaos. <i>London
    Life</i> reporters have also traced the man who calls himself
    Mr. LSD. He has given them an astonishing series of
    interviews. Read all about him, and about LSD, in this week's
    <i>London Life.'</i> </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Mr. LSD was of course our President, Desmond
O'Brien, and believe it or not&#151;the reporter was Hugh, whose
mind, as I have already indicated, was racing ahead of itself
into the higher realms of associative paranoia due to methedrine
poisoning. When I telephoned Hugh about all of this, he said that
he had been so stoned that he had told the story of what was
going on at the World Psychedelic Centre to the <i>London Life</i>
editor who was, as it happened, the reporter who first broke the
Profumo-Keeler scandal. 'This thing is bigger than the Keeler
story,' he had told Hugh. But of course it was too late for me to
do anything. There were even advertisements on
television&#151;spirals of colour in and out of focus and a voice
saying 'LSD&#151;the drug that could turn on London. Read the
exclusive story in next week's <i>London Life.'</i> <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; And the third and final straw was an article in the
Sunday tabloid, <i>The People,</i> that was headed in one-inch
lettering. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>'THE MEN BEHIND LSD&#151;THE DRUG THAT IS MENACING YOUNG
    LIVES.... The drug is LSD-25&#151;Lysergic Acid diethylamide.
    It is by far the most dangerous drug ever to become easily
    obtainable on the black market. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; LSD, which is said to give &quot;visions of
    heaven and hell&quot; is used legitimately by psychiatrists
    to produce carefully controlled hallucinations. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; In the wrong hands, the hallucinations it
    produces can lead to utter irresponsibility, disregard for
    personal safety and suicidal tendencies. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; IT IS, IN FACT, A KILLER DRUG. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We have obtained evidence of &quot;LSD
    parties&quot; being held in London. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; We have discovered an alarming group of people
    who are openly and blatantly spreading the irresponsible use
    of this terrible drug. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; These men run what they call the Psychedelic
    Centre. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; It has operated from a number of addresses,
    including one in St. James's Street, and a flat in Pont
    Street, Chelsea. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Amongst the Centre's activities is the
    publication of a handbook called <i>A Psychedelic Manual.</i>
    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This lists recommended doses of LSD and other
    drugs and antidotes, and contains a treatise on drug-induced
    hallucinations and other &quot;benefits&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The manual gives various reasons for the use of
    drugs such as LSD. These include: &quot;For personal power
    &#133; for &#133; fun &#133;for sensuous enjoyment &#133;
    &quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The manual which is written by &quot;B.
    Goldstein&quot;, says the taking of LSD and similar drugs
    offers &quot;a release from our conditionings&quot; and
    &quot;senses become more acute&quot;. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Recommending group sessions of drug-taking, the
    writer says: &quot;A person should approach the experience
    with love and trust in the company of those he trusts.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;A psychedelic experience lasts normally
    from eight to sixteen hours &#133; but the results may last
    from several days to several months. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;The voyager should set aside at least two
    days for the experience itself.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; This is irresponsible, dangerous gibberish. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; The Centre was deserted and in a state of
    considerable chaos when our investigators gained entry on
    Thursday. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; There were used hypodermic syringes, empty drug
    ampoules and a variety of pills. <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Among the litter of papers were dozens of phone
    numbers, some of them of well-known show-business stars and
    personalities.' </p>
</blockquote>

<p><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; A 'paranoid', according to Bill Burroughs, is
someone who has some idea of what is really going on. In this
sense you could say that I was a 'paranoid'. I had read the
newspapers and realised that my time was up, that the police
would now be on to me, so I split London for the country, though
with little or no idea of where I should go or what I would do. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; I rented a car through Hertz and set off for the
North, to Durham to be exact, arriving there late one evening,
and very, very stoned indeed. I still had several dozen ampoules
of methedrine, about two ounces of hashish and a similar quantity
of good grass. I spent a couple of days in Durham retracing
familiar places of my early childhood, visiting family and
generally grooving around. London seemed a memory only as I
wandered the narrow streets and alleyways surrounding the
Cathedral, a place that had become somehow unreal in my
imagination, a place I did not wish to return to. But in my
paranoid state (one of the real dangers of modern life), I began
to suspect that the Durham police were on my heels, so I left as
suddenly as I came, this time for Yorkshire and the open moors. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the next three days I just drove and drove and
drove, staying at country hotels and leaving early in the
morning. I think I must have clocked up 2000 miles since leaving
London. My drug intake had also increased, so much so that there
were times I had to park the car because I could not see the
road&#151;my vision was blurred and distorted, and I had
difficulty remembering how to change the gears or which pedal was
the brake and which was the clutch. My paranoia level also
increased and to such a degree that I thought I was being
followed by the police (such are the delusions of the advanced
methedrine-taker, who sees danger even in shadow). But the most
amazing experience occurred on the fourth night. I was cruising
through the lanes and by-ways of the Lake District in the early
hours; there was no traffic on the roads and the countryside was
still and motionless, when, suddenly, the mirror lit up and I
experienced a sort of panic. Police. It could only be the police
at this time of the night, and they had somehow got on to me. I
immediately accelerated and sped through the lanes like an
express train, swerving round corners, darting through empty
villages &#133; but still the light in the mirror. I could not
shake my pursuer, probably a cop specially trained at the Police
Driving School, I reflected. Faster and faster I sped. And still
the light in the mirror. Sheer panic. I was trembling all over.
Terror gripped my soul. I was like an animal being chased by a
pack of dogs, with no hole to dive into. Then I saw an open
farmyard, and turning into it, I drove through the potted yard
until I came to a narrow path overgrown with grass. But it was
straight and somehow I managed to keep on the path. I must have
driven three or four miles along this bumpy grassy path when the
headlights picked up a gate blocking the path, and for a moment I
was tempted to accelerate and smash my way through it, as they
seem to be able to do in the cheaper American movies. But I
stopped, and very fortunately so, because when I got out of the
car to open this 'gate' I discovered that it was a barrier fence
with a drop of about 100 feet to a river below. And that the
'path' was not a path at all but a disused railway track with the
railway lines removed. My next discovery was equally
surprising&#151;the 'light' I had been picking up in my mirror
and which I had believed was the light beam of a pursuit
police-car was only the reflection of a full moon ! I was being
chased by the moon. And it was this extraordinary hallucination
that brought me back to some kind of sanity again, and I slowly
backed my way to the farmyard and on to the road again, where I
parked the car and fell asleep, thankful that I had had such a
lucky escape from certain death. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; At dawn, when my head was a little clearer, I
decided that I had had enough of this fantasy existence and, at a
leisurely speed, drove back to London and to my flat in Pont
Street. Strange! Back in the face of this flaming world I am
reminded of the serenity of the Buddha. And my mad car ride was
like a dream, induced by all the drugs; I had been to hell, but
the flames had done me no damage; they were as harmless as
shadows. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &#133; A new dawn breaks. Once more, as on the
first day of creation, I am born. The laughing moon, insecure and
pale, hurries away from the flaming sun in a sweeping curve. The
silver has changed into a dull red. The black background which
but a few hours ago threatened to absorb me, reveals itself now
as a grey crust of dross. And I am back in reality once more. A
thought strikes me: must addicts all contend with a nisus to
