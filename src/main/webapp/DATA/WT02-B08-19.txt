<H2>CI INTRODUCES ITS NEW FASTRACKA FLUORIMETER</H2>
Chelsea Instruments has entered into an agreement with the Brookhaven National Laboratory to develop, manufacture and market the Fast Repetition Rate Fluorimeter (FRRF) technology. This instrument joins CI's range of fluorimeters and is marketed under the name "Fastracka".<BR>Delivery of the instrument begins in April.

<P>This new generation of oceanographic instrument has the capability to measure the photosynthetic reaction of chlorophyll in the ocean. This is of particular interest to the environmental and scientific communities, since it gives a unique insight into primary production and thus the overall health of the ocean ecosystem. This is directly related to the uptake and release of carbon dioxide in the surface waters of the oceans and is fundamentally linked to current studies of the Greenhouse Effect.<P>

During the IRONEX experiment in 1995, scientists used the Fastracka to assess the primary production before and after seeding an area of ocean with iron. An area of ocean south of the Galapagos Islands in the Equatorial Pacific was chosen as a region high in nutrients, but with abnormally low phytoplankton population. It was hypothesed that a deficiency in iron was limiting production.<P>

To test this theory 500 pounds of iron solution was spread over a 25 square miles area. After a few days the once blue ocean was green due to the abundance of chlorophyll bearing phytoplankton. To monitor this feature a Fastracka was towed in a Nu-Shuttle repetitively across the area to assess the horizontal, vertical and temporal extent of the bloom.<P>

The fluorimeter flash emits a blue light at a high repitition rate and then measures the amount of red light the object fluoresces. If phytoplankton growing under these conditions is environmentally stressed it tends to lose more energy to heat (and fluoresces more than a healthy plant). The IRONEX results confirmed that the phytoplankton fluorescence was less after being fertilised and thus healthier than before the seeding.<P>

Given this success it is seen that the Fastracka / Nu-Shuttle combination is an important new tool in biological oceanography. In particular there is a great paucity of data on photosynthetic characteristics in the world's oceans, both spatially and seasonally, and these parameters are required for basin scale productivity models, linking in-situ data and satellite remote sensing of biological processes. <A HREF="#list">Back to the News Index</A>

<H2>OCEANOLOGY INTERNATIONAL '97, 12-14 MAY 1997, WORLD TRADE CENTRE, SINGAPORE.
</H2>
Chelsea Instruments has led the market in the production of towed vehicles for many years. Two of these vehicles will be on display at OI97:<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Aquashuttle</B> - Stable, high speed undulating vehicle, towed at controllable depths and capable of carrying a wide range of instruments.<P>

<LI><B>Nu-Shuttle</B> - Towed undulating oceanographic vehicle, large versatile payload, suitable for ships of opportunity.
<P>

Also on display will be CI's  range of optical instrumentation including:<BR>

<P>
<LI><B>Aquatracka III</B> - Lightweight fluorimeter for chlorophyll-a determination, rhodamine dye tracking or turbidity measurements.<P>

<LI><B>UV-Aquatracka</B> - In-situ PMT fluorimeter for hydrocarbon and Gelbstoff detection.<P>

<LI><B>Alphatracka I and II transmissometers</B> - High accuracy measurement of suspended and dissolved solids throughout the water column.<P>

<LI><B>Aquapack</B> - Multi-parameter system for environmental monitoring in oceans, rivers, lakes and reservoirs.
<P>

On display for the first time will be two new optical products for 1997:<BR>
<P>

<LI><B>Minitracka</B> - A small, low cost chlorophyll fluorimeter with very low power consumption.<P>

<LI><B>Fastracka</B> - This Fast Repetition Rate Fluorimeter measures variable fluorescence of marine phytoplankton  and other biophysical parameters in-situ.

<H2>VISIT THE CHELSEA INSTRUMENTS STAND AT IMDEX ASIA 97, WORLD TRADE CENTRE, SINGAPORE, 6-9 MAY 1997</H2>
From its pioneering work in designing, developing and installing military oceanographic equipment, Chelsea Instruments has a comprehensive capability for submarine, surface ships and towed vehicle systems. On display at IMDEX 97, Singapore, will be the <B>Subpack</B> oceanographic monitoring system which enables submarines to gain an incressed knowledge of the oceanographic environment. Also on display will be the <B>Aquashuttle</B> and <B>Nu-Shuttle</B> towed undulating vehicles together with a new generation of in-situ optical sensors. <B> Fastracka</B> is a novel fluorimeter for the monitoring of primary production and marine ecosystem health and <B>Minitracka</B> is a new low cost, high precision chlorophyll fluorimeter. A model of the Autosub autonomuous vehicle (Southampton Oceanography Centre) and Autonomous Profiling Vehicles from the Ocean Sensors Inc of San Diego will be exhibited.<P>
Marine Acoustics Lts, England, will be sharing the Chelsea Instruments stand at IMDEX 97. On display for the first time will be the versatile Acoustic Source System (VASS) which provides calibration and echo repeat functions for latest generation, surface ship and submarine sonars. Also on display will be the thin line, digitally multiplexed hydrophone array and a high data rate, acoustic telemetry modem. Other products include low frequency sources, transducer and hydrophones, acoustic releases and miniture echo sounders.

<H2>CI's MINIATURE FLUORIMETER GOES INTO PRODUCTION IN 1997</H2>

The Minitracka miniature fluorimeter is the latest in-situ optical sensor from Chelsea Instruments. The scientists and engineers that introduced the highly successful Aquatracka range of fluorimeters have now come up with Minitracka.<P>

This instrument is a small, low cost chlorophyll fluorimeter with very low power consumption, yet with a performance approaching that of the well proven Aquatracka III fluorimeter.  The new fluorimeter has an acetyl pressure housing and is rated to 600 metres depth.  Production of the instrument will begin in early 1997.<P>
