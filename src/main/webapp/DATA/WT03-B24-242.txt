<h1><center> BIO, FDA talk new reform agenda </h1> </center> <p>

WASHINGTON -- Fourteen biotech CEOs met last week with FDA Commissioner David Kessler to discuss proposals for speeding early-stage drug development, providing some optimism that the door to administrative reform remains open at the agency. <P>

Meanwhile, House Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas Bliley announced dates for hearings on the agency and suggested that the House Republican leadership finally will introduce reform legislation soon. <P>

The biotech summit with Kessler focused on exploring ways FDA can speed early-stage drug development, Biotechnology Industry Organization President Carl Feldbaum said. In contrast to most of the reforms announced to date, which focus on the final stage of the approvals process and manufacturing and distribution of approved products, the changes under discussion would benefit emerging companies. <P>

<B><CENTER>Specific ideas</B></CENTER><P>

The executives came into the meeting with seven or eight specific ideas and the meeting focused on the "nuts-and-bolts" of how FDA can reduce delays at the front end of the drug development process. <P>

Feldbaum said the discussion was the third such meeting with Kessler since major administrative FDA reforms were announced last November. Several teleconferences between BIO CEOs and Kessler and his staff also have been held. <P>

Although the FDA did not put specific proposals on the table, or commit itself to a timetable for proposing or implementing solutions, Feldbaum said Kessler seemed committed to "work out the glitches" in the approvals process, especially delays in the FDA's response mechanisms. <P>

The commissioner was accompanied by Director Kathryn Zoon of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), and Deputy Commissioner and policy advisor Mary Pendergast. Pendergast played a key role in negotiations between the biotech industry and FDA leading up to the last set of reform announcements. The 10-year FDA veteran is expected to be Kessler's point person in translating commitments made at the conference table into action. <P>

<B><CENTER>'Drug lag'</B></CENTER><P>

Feldbaum said "there is every indication" that there will be further meetings with Kessler, with "intense staff-to-staff interaction" in the interim. <P>

A focus on the front end of the development process would be well placed, according to "Untimely Access: An Analysis of America's 'Drug Lag'," a report by Robert Goldberg released last week by The Center On Neuroscience, Medical Progress & Society at George Washington University Medical Center in Washington. The report attacks Kessler's recent assertions that FDA has eliminated the "drug lag" and that it has speeded up drug development. <P>

Goldberg's report notes that although the time for reviewing NDAs "declined from 33 months in 1987 to 19 months in 1992," the total drug development period has increased from 8.2 years in 1962 to 15 years in 1993. The time required to discover a drug, approximately 2.6 years, has remained flat throughout that period, according to Goldberg. He attributes the increased development time in part to increases in the time required to gain FDA approval for Phase I and Phase II trials. <P>

ICOS Chairman and CEO George Rathmann, who attended the meeting with Kessler, told BioCentury that FDA has continually increased its demands for tests and paperwork in the earliest stages of clinical development over the past 20 years. Although the increased regulatory burden has increased the cost of development and prevented patients from getting effective therapies, the safety profile of approved drugs has not improved, according to Rathmann. <P>

On the legislative front, Virginia Republican Bliley announced that the Commerce Committee will hold hearings on FDA reform on Feb. 27. He said that legislation introduced by the committee members will include provisions "transferring FDA reviews to third-party organizations whenever possible." <P>

Bliley said he and Speaker Newt Gingrich hope the legislation, which has not been introduced, will be enacted this year. Bliley acknowledged, however, that presidential politics and the crowded House schedule may preclude passage in this Congress. <P>

Bliley's staff counsel, John Cohrssen, said that in addition to mandating third party reviews, the House legislation also may attempt to speed IND approvals. <P>

<B><CENTER>Lowered expectations</B></CENTER><P>

Cohrssen, however, also was not overly optimistic about the prospects for legislation this year. "FDA reform may take longer than just this Congress or a couple of Congresses," he said. <P>

On the Senate side, legislative hearings will be held Feb. 27 and 28th on the reform bill, S 1477, introduced in December by Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairman Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., according to Jane Williams, the key staff member responsible for the bill, which has bipartisan support. <P>

Speaking at a panel discussion sponsored by the Progress & Freedom Foundation on the prospects for FDA reform in 1996, Williams said markup is tentatively scheduled for March 15. She said enactment of the bill is a "top priority" for Kassebaum, who will not seek reelection after her term expires this year. <P>

David Nexon, a senior aide to Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, who specializes in health care , said "Kennedy strongly supports bipartisan, responsible reform." But Nexon warned "there is no chance" that modification of the fundamental structure of food and drug regulation will be enacted. "Sweeping reforms don't have a chance, " Nexon said. <P>
